Car-makers pick rival virtual assistants,"Hyundai has teamed up with Google to allow users of Google Home to lock their cars remotely, among other features Four leading car brands have announced deals with three tech giants to add virtual assistants to new cars. Microsoft's Cortana netted two of the deals, the others went to Amazon's Alexa and Google's Assistant. The announcements were made at the CES tech show in Las Vegas. One analyst said there would be a ""battle of the giants"" over the adoption of virtual assistants in 2017, since they can be built in to a variety of appliances. Nissan and BMW have opted to work with Microsoft to bring Cortana to selected vehicles in the near future. Ford, however, has struck a deal with Amazon meaning its assistant, Alexa, will feature in some of its cars. And Hyundai andDaimler,externalhave said they will make their cars partly voice-operable with Google Assistant. Ford has warned customers not to be distracted while driving and talking to Alexa Apple's Siri assistant is alreadyavailable in certain cars as well,external- via the firm's CarPlay software. Many brands - including BMW, Nissan, Hyundai and Ford - have produced models that support it. Car-makers are interested in bringing such functionality to their vehicles as a means of making them easier to interact with - and to connect home appliances to drivers while they are on the road. With Alexa,Ford plans to give drivers,externalthe ability to close net-connected garage doors, or to play an audiobook, picking up from wherever they had previously left off. In Hyundai's case, Google Assistantwill integrate with the firm's Blue Link software,external. Drivers will be able to start the car, adjust air conditioning, lock the doors or send destination details to the vehicle by voice alone. A sample command given by the firm was: ""OK Google, tell Blue Link to start my Santa Fe and set the temperature to 72 degrees."" The tech giants are vying for a place not just in your home - but also your car BMW discussed a handful of ways drivers might use its digital platform, BMW Connected, and Cortana in future cars - including booking restaurant tables. ""BMW Connected can provide a reminder en-route of an upcoming appointment for which no location has yet been fixed,"" the company said. ""And Cortana can be used to make a suitable restaurant recommendation and reserve a table."" Toyota also announced a futuristic concept car at CES, the Concept-i.It features its own digital assistant, named Yui,external. ""It's really going to be a battle of the giants, starting in 2017,"" said Adam Simon, a tech analyst at Context. ""In exactly the same way that Amazon is doing a great job at the moment of building an ecosystem in the home, there'll be an ecosystem in the car,"" he told the BBC. Microsoft boss Satya Nadella has said he believes digital assistants will change the web Some car manufacturers, including Ford, are already warning drivers not to be distracted when using such products. Last year, researchers at the University of Sussex found that using a hands-free device while drivingwas as distracting as picking up a phone. ""In the very long play we can see vehicles becoming a real entertainment space - an extension of people's lounges,"" said Jack Wetherill, a tech analyst at Futuresource. ""The real endgame is we all put our feet up and watch movies, the digital assistant does the driving."" In the short-term, he said that Amazon was likely hoping to encourage more purchases of entertainment content from its online store - such content could then be listened to in the car or watched by passengers.

Island of safety,"Shotguns and air rifles are the only firearms you can legally buy in Japan Japan has one of the lowest rates of gun crime in the world. In 2014 there were just six gun deaths, compared to 33,599 in the US. What is the secret? If you want to buy a gun in Japan you need patience and determination. You have to attend an all-day class, take a written exam and pass a shooting-range test with a mark of at least 95%. There are also mental health and drugs tests. Your criminal record is checked and police look for links to extremist groups. Then they check your relatives too - and even your work colleagues. And as well as having the power to deny gun licences, police also have sweeping powers to search and seize weapons. That's not all. Handguns are banned outright. Only shotguns and air rifles are allowed. The law restricts the number of gun shops. In most of Japan's 40 or so prefectures there can be no more than three, and you can only buy fresh cartridges by returning the spent cartridges you bought on your last visit. A photo posed by models - even Japanese gangsters rarely use guns these days Police must be notified where the gun and the ammunition are stored - and they must be stored separately under lock and key. Police will also inspect guns once a year. And after three years your licence runs out, at which point you have to attend the course and pass the tests again. This helps explain why mass shootings in Japan are extremely rare. When mass killings occur, the killer most often wields a knife. In a world where a lot is going wrong there is also a lot going right. So what if you could build a country with policies that actually worked, by homing in ideas around the world that have been truly successful? Listen toMy Perfect Countryon the BBC World Service Ordownload the podcast Email the programme,external The current gun control law was introduced in 1958, but the idea behind the policy dates back centuries. ""Ever since guns entered the country, Japan has always had strict gun laws,"" says Iain Overton, executive director of Action on Armed Violence and the author of Gun Baby Gun. ""They are the first nation to impose gun laws in the whole world and I think it laid down a bedrock saying that guns really don't play a part in civilian society."" People were being rewarded for giving up firearms as far back as 1685, a policy Overton describes as ""perhaps the first ever gun buyback initiative"". ""The moment you have guns in society, you will have gun violence but I think it's about the quantity,"" says Overton. ""If you have very few guns in society, you will almost inevitably have low levels of violence."" Japanese police officers rarely use guns and put much greater emphasis on martial arts - all are expected to become a black belt in judo. They spend more time practising kendo (fighting with bamboo swords) than learning how to use firearms. ""The response to violence is never violence, it's always to de-escalate it. Only six shots were fired by Japanese police nationwide [in 2015],"" says journalist Anthony Berteaux. ""What most Japanese police will do is get huge futons and essentially roll up a person who is being violent or drunk into a little burrito and carry them back to the station to calm them down."" This video can not be played Japanese police practise martial arts every week and avoid using weapons whenever they can Overton contrasts this with the American model, which he says has been ""to militarise the police"". ""If you have too many police pulling out guns at the first instance of crime, you lead to a miniature arms race between police and criminals,"" he says. To underline the taboo attached to inappropriate use of weapons, an officer who used his gun to kill himself was charged posthumously with a criminal offence. He carried out the act while on duty - policemen never carry weapons off-duty, leaving them at the station when they finish their shift. The care police take with firearms is mirrored in the self-defence forces. Journalist Jake Adelstein once attended a shooting practice, which ended with the gathering up of  the bullet casings - and there was great concern when one turned out to be missing. ""One bullet shell was unaccounted for - one shell had fallen behind one of the targets - and nobody was allowed to leave the facilities until they found the shell,"" he says. There is no clamour in Japan for gun regulations to be relaxed, says Berteaux. ""A lot of it stems from this post-war sentiment of pacifism that the war was horrible and we can never have that again,"" he explains. There are a limited number of longstanding rifle owners in Japan - when they die their heirs must hand the rifles in ""People assume that peace is always going to exist and when you have a culture like that you don't really feel the need to arm yourself or have an object that disrupts that peace."" In fact, moves to expand the role of Japan's self-defence forces in foreign peacekeeping operations have caused concern in some quarters. ""It is unknown territory,"" says political science professor Koichi Nakano. ""Maybe the government will try to normalise occasional death in the self-defence force and perhaps even try to glorify the exercise of weapons?"" According to Iain Overton, the ""almost taboo level of rejection"" of guns in Japan means that the country is ""edging towards a perfect place"" - though he points out that Iceland also achieves a very low rate of gun crime, despite a much higher level of gun ownership. Henrietta Moore of the Institute for Global Prosperity at University College London applauds the Japanese for not viewing gun ownership as ""a civil liberty"", and rejecting the idea of firearms as ""something you use to defend your property against others"". But for Japanese gangsters the tight gun control laws are a problem. Yakuza gun crime has sharply declined in the last 15 years, but those who continue to carry firearms have to find ingenious ways of smuggling them into the country. ""The criminals pack the guns inside of a tuna so it looks like a frozen tuna,"" says retired police officer Tahei Ogawa. ""But we have discovered cases where they have actually hidden a gun inside."" Join the conversation - find the BBC World Service onFacebook,externalandTwitter,external.

Unrecognised talent,"Om Puri was known for his gritty performances One of India's finest actors, Om Puri, died in Mumbai on Friday, aged 66. Film writer Aseem Chhabra believes he never got the recognition he deserved. In 2007 Om Puri played a significant supporting role in Mike Nichols' Charlie Wilson's War: portraying a near-perfect Pakistani president Zia-ul-Haq. In one scene he spoke in a delightful Punjabi accented English and cautiously suggested to Charlie Wilson, a Congressman from Texas played by Tom Hanks, that covert aid to the mujahideen, fighting the Soviet occupation of Afghanistan, should pass through the hands of the Pakistani government. I wanted to write something on this terrific actor, one of the few from India who straddled so many film spaces - from Bollywood to Indian art house indies, British Asian immigrant stories and big Hollywood productions. Om Puri: Veteran Indian actor dies aged 66 But the publicists for the film and even the studio Universal Pictures informed me that they had no images of Puri. Sadly this amazing actor had left no impression on the publicists who were mostly focused on promoting Hanks and his co-star Julia Roberts. Puri acted in over 300 film projects in India and abroad, and yet he did not get the kind of recognition that he surely deserved. He won two National Awards in India in the acting category (Arohan, 1982 and Ardh Satya, 1983), and was recognised at a number of film festivals, including a lifetime achievement medal at the prestigious Telluride Film Festival. Director Roland JoffÃ© cast Puri in a supporting role in City of Joy This video can not be played Om Puri found international fame for his roles in films such as East is East He was even nominated for a Bafta film award in 2000 for playing the lead in Ayub Khan Din's autobiographical British film East is East. But unfortunately in the last decade or so Puri, the actor, was largely forgotten in the West and even in India. He did play one last big role in the West - that of an Indian chef in a remote French town in The Hundred-Foot Journey (2014), opposite a feisty Helen Mirren. It was a rare moment when Puri was suddenly, albeit briefly, the focus of a film produced by Steven Spielberg and Oprah Winfrey. While promoting that film, Puri told me that Hindi cinema mostly concentrated on younger, good-looking actors. And the industry had relegated him to roles of the father of a lead actor or a police officer. He was rarely offered meaty roles, he complained. He was always hungry for more challenging work and recognition. In another interview while promoting East is East (1999), Puri told me that his big regret was that he would never get the kind of roles given to Dustin Hoffman and Robert De Niro. But Om Puri was as great an actor as Hoffman and De Niro. In fact, one can say he was even better, given the number of films he acted in and the range of his performances. Puri (left extreme)'s comic timing was perfect in Jaane Bhi Do Yaro Puri was one of the most versatile Indian actors His comic timing was perfect and we can see that in the cult classic indie Jaane Bhi Do Yaaro (1983) and later on in Vishal Bhardwaj's Maqbool - a modern-day take on Macbeth, where Puri played one of the witches, along with his colleague and friend Naseeruddin Shah. Also in the same time period he played a sleazy photographer in Shyam Benegal's Mandi (1983). He was the voice of an angry, frustrated cop in Ardh Satya (1983), but was equally charming and seductive with his co-star, the late Smita Patil.  And in Aakrosh (1980) he was the oppressed peasant who barely uttered a word. Puri became one of the first Indian actors of his generation to crossover to the West with his work in British films - East is East, its less successful sequel West is West (2010), the rarely seen Brothers in Trouble (1995), the Hanif Kureishi scripted My Son the Fanatic (1997), and the mini-series White Teeth (2002), based on Zadie Smith's bestseller novel. That was a time when nearly every Indian or Pakistani role in a British production was offered to Puri. Hollywood came calling as well. Mike Nichols also cast him in an important role in Wolf (1994) where Puri shared screen time with Jack Nicholson. And earlier Roland JoffÃ© cast him in a supporting role in City of Joy (1992). Om Puri acted in the TV series Jewel in the Crown In 1994, Ismail Merchant cast Puri as a hapless college professor who sets out to interview an ageing and overweight Urdu poet (Shashi Kapoor) in In Custody, based on Anita Desai's Man Booker Prize shortlisted novel. Puri was perfect in the film, displaying his frustration as he observed the decline of Urdu language and poetry. But it is the sad reality of the film business, that talented men and women find it harder to get juicy roles as they get older. And Puri had to face that fact. Om Puri died too soon. But he has left a huge body of work reflecting his four decades as a film actor. He should get the most attention that a master actor of his stature deserves.

Straight A dropout,"Billy Willson received a 4.0 grade point average, the equivalent to straight As, for his first semester at Kansas State University. He decided that it would also be his last. In a strongly worded Facebook post, Willson uploaded a photograph of himself standing outside the university's sign, holding his middle finger up to it. In the accompanying text he wrote: ""YOU ARE BEING SCAMMED. You may not see it today or tomorrow, but you will see it some day,"" he wrote. ""You are being put thousands into debt to learn things you will never even use. Wasting 4 years of your life to be stuck at a paycheck that grows slower than the rate of inflation. Paying $200 for a $6 textbook."" Billy and his girlfriend Brittany Quinn at a Kansas State University football game His post, which has been shared more than 10,000 times in little more than a fortnight and has provoked a vigorous debate in the comments, appears to have struck a chord with other young adults who are wondering if pursuing higher education is worth the time and money. Willson, who was on an Architectural Engineering undergraduate course told BBC Trending that the ""cost of inflation is relatively small compared to the cost of college over the last 30 or so years. I mean, it really is ridiculous how the cost of college has gone up."" He's backed up by data. According to theUS Department of Education,externalthe average annual increase in college tuition in the United States, between 1980-2014, grew by nearly 260% compared to the nearly 120% increase in all consumer items. In 1980,the average cost of tuition, room and board, and fees,externalfor a four-year course was over $9,000. Thatcost now,externalis more than $23,000 for state colleges. If you want to go private it's more than $30,000. A similar hike in tuition fees has also been seen in England. In 2012, the government backed initiatives from some universities to charge more than the Â£9,000 tuition fee limit. In the post Willson also cited higher education debt as a reason to leave university and enter the work place. Students in the United Statesare estimated,externalto be in around over $1.2 trillion of loan debt with 7 million borrowers in default. Willson says that when he first told his parents that he was leaving university, they were ""very upset"" but are now supportive of his decision. So were dozens of others of people who commented on Facebook. Trey Foshee wrote: ""Years and money wasted. Very much agree. I have two degrees that I would sell back right now if they'd let me."" Others, like Blair Brown, agreed with Willson also pointed out that some professions do require a university degree. ""Being an engineer, scientist, or computer technician could be learned rather quickly through apprenticeships, independent study, and hands-on experience. Human nature is to learn by doing, not learning to do. As for more professional careers such as medical doctors and lawyers, university study is admittedly necessary,"" Brown commented. Not everyone was supportive however, a comment onThe Collegian,external, Kansas State's student newspaper accused Willson of adding to stereotypes about his generation: ""First of all, thanks for continuing to destroy the millennial reputation with your entitled, everything-should-be-easy, get-me-rich-fast mentality... You have completely just destroyed your reputation. When you fall hard and fast...you are going to need a real, big kid job and guess what? Something called Google exists and even my grandma can dig up dirt on you."" Willson, who told Trending that he is currently employed for a trade show sales team and his employers did Google him and they saw the funny side. He adds that he hopes enough work experience will allow him to be employed by an architectural engineering team in the future. He doesn't think university will play any part in that future. ""They would have to make a massive change to the system before I would consider that and I don't think they'll do that while I'm still young enough to want to go"" Blog byMegha Mohan,external Next story:Torture video prompts online race fight A shocking, graphic video showing torture and racial abuse led far-right activists to link the perpetrators to the Black Lives Matter movement.READ MORE You can follow BBC Trending on Twitter@BBCtrending,external, and find us onFacebook,external.

The greatest wall,"William Lindesay has been obsessed with the Great Wall of China since seeing it in a school atlas as a child in England, and last year embarked on an epic journey to fulfil a lifelong ambition - to film the wall in its entirety from the air. He told the BBC's Anna Jones about this quest. ""The Great Wall is an amazing sight, and it deserves to be seen in its best light,"" says William from his home in Beijing. Unable to shake his childhood fascination, he moved to China from Wallasey on Merseyside in 1986 ""for the wall"", and has since researched it extensively, writing several books and gaining an OBE for his work. This video can not be played The wall as filmed from the air by the Lindesays The wall most tourists see today is in places like Badaling or Jinshangling, an easy day trip from Beijing, where the stones and towers have been repeatedly restored,not always sympathetically. ""But there's more to the wall than that,"" says William, who trained as a geographer. ""Before the tourist wall that people flock to, there were many other 'Great Walls of China'."" Few tourists see more of the wall than the manicured sections near Beijing Sprawled across northern China and into Mongolia, the creation of these various walls spanned centuries and ruling dynasties. The oldest parts date back more than 2,000 years. In some places towering stone and in others heaped-up earth, the walls have variously served as highways, defensive fortresses, a communication network and even a fence to contain migrating animals. ""Over the past 30 years I've been looking at all of these walls, as far as possible,"" says William. ""My travels have taken me all over northern China, even as far as Mongolia."" In the 1990s, he and his wife, Wu Qi, bought a farmhouse at the foot of the wall, and would spend most weekends there exploring it. William Lindesay has been exploring the wall since the mid-1980s William and Wu Qi have brought their sons up in the shadow of the Great Wall Photography has always been important, says William, whether the images were ""just beautiful or whether the architecture, the design features had a meaning that I wanted to explain in my writing"". But in 2016 his sons, Jim and Tommy, had a suggestion for seeing the wall in a whole new way, and began, as they put it, pestering him to buy them a drone. ""I was very concerned they'd come back from the first trip without the drone,"" says William. He eventually caved, and the results, coupled with some self-taught editing flair from his sons, have been ""out of this world"". ""Over the years, publishers and filmmakers have come to me and said, let's do the Great Wall from the air,"" he says. ""My typical reply was that unless you've got millions and millions of dollars, and high-level contacts with the government and the armed forces, who control the skies, then forget it. ""In this way drone technology is a godsend."" So armed with their drone and with a travel agency sponsor, the family spent a total of 60 days tracing the walls in 2016, celebrating William's 60th birthday and his 30th year of living in China ""for the wall"". They began in July at the Old Dragon's Head, the point where the Ming dynasty-era Great Wall meets the sea in the east, and followed it westwards, branching off to explore the older Zhao wall, dating back to 300BC, then hundreds of kilometres further west, the Han dynasty wall. The Zhao wall in Inner Mongolia bears little relation to most people's image of the Great Wall William and his sons spent weeks camping in Mongolia to trace the wall That was followed in August by a flight to Ulan Bator in Mongolia, from where they camped in the wild while tracing what is marked on old maps as the Wall of Genghis Khan. William calculates the entire journey to have been some 15,000km (9,320 miles) and says flying the drone over these remote areas gave a whole new perspective on the ruins. ""When you go to Mongolia, you find a wall that doesn't actually excite you. You can barely see it in the broad light of day. ""Very early in the morning, just before sundown, if you're lucky you get low angle sunlight, you can see the shadow of this structure not snaking, but streaking straight across the steppe."" But from the air it becomes ""a phenomenal sight... with the empty steppeland, golden sunlight and the mound underlined by very very dark shadow"". Items discarded around the wall, like this 16th Century rock bomb, give a clue to the people who built it ""In my mind of all the shots that the boys took of the Great Wall from the air, that is the most surprising, because it just looks so amazing, the wall in that completely empty landscape, you feel as though you're on the very edge of Central Asia."" William is also clearly fascinated by the role the wall has played in the history of the Chinese people. Seeing it from the air, he says, helps an observer get in to the mind of its creators. ""We see the twists and turns, and we ask, why did it twist and turn there? Why did they route it along there, and not along there?"" ""The land beside the wall where the builders established their camps, their villages, where they sourced all their building materials - I view this as the Great Wall's historical landscape."" Beyond the romance of travel and photography, this contrast of old and new underlines the other reason for their trip. ""There's a lot of hullabaloo always about how long the Great Wall is, and stories about the wall getting shorter because it's getting damaged,"" says William. ""So I'll be looking at the footage and, trying to work out how close things are getting to the wall. ""There are laws and regulations made in the last 10 years to protect the Great Wall landscape, and I'm going to be be interested to see how the reality matches up.""

Manor Racing enter administration,"Manor finished bottom of the constructors' championship last season with just one point Manor Racing have gone into administration and will collapse without new investment. Staff were informed of the development on Friday by chief executive officer Thomas Mayer, a source told BBC Sport. Administrators FRP said there was ""a very limited window of opportunity"" to save the team before the start of the 2017 season in Australia on 26 March. FRP said it was ""assessing options"" and that the process affected Manor's operating company Just Racing Services. Manor Grand Prix Racing, which owns the rights to the team's participation in F1, is not in administration. Team owner Stephen Fitzpatrick said in a note to staff: ""It was imperative that the team finish in 10th place or better in 2016."" Manor,who finished 11th and lastin the championship last season, have been in talks with new investors but so far no deal has been concluded. Administrator Geoff Rowley said: ""The team has made significant progress since the start of 2015, but the position remains that operating a F1 team requires significant ongoing investment. ""The senior management team has worked tirelessly to bring new investment, but regrettably has been unable to do so within the time available. ""Therefore, they have been left with no alternative but to place [Manor Racing] into administration."" A source said several buyers had been lined up over the past few weeks and two had gone as far as conducting a due diligence process. But none of them provided the funds necessary to buy the team, nor was there any proof they had the money to run it. Fitzpatrick, the boss of the energy company Ovo, decided to put the team into administration on Thursday night. Manor were known as Marussia when they went into administration during the 2014 season FRP were also appointedthe last time the team were in administrationover the winter of 2014/15, after they collapsed with debts of Â£35m. At the time, they were known as Marussia, and were reconstituted under their original name of Manor when Fitzpatrick bought them at the 11th hour just before the 2015 season. Manor, who are based in Banbury in Oxfordshire, suffered a blow at the end of last season when Sauber moved ahead of them into 10th place in the constructors' championship thanks to the ninth place achieved by Felipe Nasrat the penultimate race of the year in Brazil. ""For much of the season we were on track,"" said Fitzpatrick. ""But the dramatic race in Brazil ended our hopes of [finishing 10th] and ultimately brought into doubt the team's ability to race in 2017. ""We made a huge amount of progress on and off track but ultimately it was not enough."" That cost Manor in the region of Â£10m in prize money - income they needed to survive into the new season - and the loss of it has made potential drivers and their backers reluctant to commit funds to the team, sources said. Fitzpatrick saidat the final race of the season in Abu Dhabithat the loss of income was ""not a deal-breaker"" in the talks he was having with new investors. But there had been no further news from the team until Friday's development.

Bradford club 'needs three years' support',"This video can not be played Did this moment seal Bradford Bulls' fate? The owners of a new Bradford rugby league club will need to financially support the side for three years, says the Rugby Football League. Bradford Bulls were liquidated on Tuesday after administrators were unable to find a suitable buyer. The governing body has received 10 expressions of interest and has set a deadline of Monday, 9 January. Bidders are more likely to succeed if they promise to honour season tickets and rugby league debts, says the RFL. The RFL Board, which is independent, will make a final decision within a couple of weeks. If an agreement is reached, the new side would play their first competitive game against Hull KR on Sunday, 5 February. Bradford Bulls go into liquidation 'Rugby league needs iconic Bulls' Listen to BBC Radio Leeds' Bradford Bulls special programme The new club would also start with a 12-point deduction. Central funding in the first year would also be limited to Â£150,000, the lowest of any Championship side. A document sent by the RFL to all interested parties says that directors and shareholders of any new club would be held personally liable if it fails. Potential new owners would have to provide proof of funds and show relevant experience of running a club before they are considered, as well passing a fit and proper persons test. The RFL has also asked for information on potential player recruitment plans and the development of the academy.

How dangerous is Turkey's unrest?,"Jihadist group Islamic State said it was behind the 1 January attack on the Reina nightclub in Istanbul Turkey's biggest cities have witnessed a spate of deadly bombings and a bloody attempted coup. For so long a beacon of stability between Europe and the Middle East, Turkey has entered a period of high tension. It has long fought Kurdish militants in its restive east. Now it is trying to prevent Islamist militant violence spreading from Syria and is cracking down on suspected supporters of the failed July 2016 coup. Turkey's main population centres of Ankara and Istanbul have endured a wave of deadly bomb and gun attacks, as well as a failed coup that saw tanks on the streets and fighter jets targeting parliament. In a matter of months, Istanbul has seen rebel soldiers take over the bridges across the Bosphorus, a double bombing outside Besiktas football stadium, and a gun attack blamed on jihadist group Islamic State (IS) targeting New Year revellers at an exclusive nightclub on the waterfront. Ankara has witnessed the assassination of its Russian ambassador. Other cities such as Izmir in the west and Kayseri in central Turkey have been targeted too. This video can not be played The BBC's Mark Lowen was one of the first journalists allowed into the nightclub site The human cost has been immense. At least 270 people died on 15 and 16 July 2016, when Turkey's government survived an internal rebellion blamed on a movement led by a US-based Islamic cleric. Thirty-nine people lost their lives on New Year's Eve in the Reina nightclub. Until recently, the bloodshed was largely confined to the mainly Kurdish areas of the east and south-east, where the Turkish military has battled the militantKurdistan Workers' Party (PKK)for decades. But the conflict in Syria and turbulence in domestic politics has created new tensions. And a ceasefire with Kurdish militants proved short-lived. The message for Turks is clear: that the risk of violence is not limited to the border and it is on several fronts. Turks tried to challenge rebel tanks as they took to the streets of Ankara in July 2016 Turkey is no longer the safe destination that made it one of the world's biggest tourist draws. The coup is over but since July 2016 the country has been under a state of emergency. And yet the main tourist resorts on the coast have avoided the violence seen elsewhere. France has urged its citizens toexercise great vigilance while travelling and in tourist areas,external; the UK says that while it is generally safe to travel to Turkey,additional safety precautions should be taken,external. The US warns its citizens of""increased threats from terrorist groups throughout Turkey"",external. Tourists are not a target for Kurdish militants but they are for IS, which targeted Istanbul airport last June because it has become one of Europe's busiest transport hubs, attractingalmost 42 million passengers in 2015,external. According to one calculation, Turkey suffered 269 attacks in 2016. Turks themselves have become afraid of going to shopping centres and open spaces, and yet they remain defiant in the face of violence. ""I think we are seeing a downward spiral towards more violence,"" warns Prof Menderes Cinar of Baskent University in Ankara. Who are the Kurds?- The long history of the Middle East's fourth-largest ethnic group Turkey v Islamic State v the Kurds- What's going on? No cause for optimism in divided Turkey Is Turkey still a democracy? Turkey torture claims in wake of failed coup Turkey sees itself targeted by three groups of ""terrorists"": IS, Kurdish militants and coup-plotters. Since the failed 15 July coup, Turkey's government has detained thousands of suspected sympathisers in the security forces. Officials say 41,000 people have been arrested and 100,000 dismissed from jobs in public life. The focus of the crackdown is a shadowy movement described as a ""parallel state"", said to owe its allegiance to cleric Fethullah Gulen, who is in self-imposed exile in the US. Who are the Gulenists? Turkey - after the coup But as the purge continues, so too do Turkey's internal security threats. A long-running internal conflict with Kurdish militants had been quiet for a couple of years, until an IS suicide bomber targeted a rally of young Kurdish activistsnear the Syrian border at Surucin July 2015. Violence in the main cities tended to target party offices, particularly those of the left-wing and pro-Kurdish HDP (Peoples' Democratic Party). The banned Marxist DKHP-C has periodically carried out attacks on police and Western embassies. This video can not be played The 13 March blast in Ankara was claimed by the Kurdish militant group TAK But then the ceasefire collapsed. In one year, more than 600 members of the Turkish security forces were killed in attacks blamed on the militant PKK. A splinter group, the TAK (Kurdistan Freedom Hawks), carried out a string of bloody attacks that killed civilians as well as police and soldiers in Ankara. On 13 March 2016, 37 people died when the TAK targeted a busy transport hub in Ankara and 44 were killed in December when two bombs exploded near police outside Besiktas's Vodafone Arena in Istanbul. For many Turks, the PKK is no different from its offshoot. This video can not be played ""Curse those who did this"": The BBC's Mark Lowen meets the families left behind But some of the deadliest and highest-profile attacks have been blamed on IS: October 2015:More than 100 people died, many of the Kurds, in a double bombing on a peace rally near Ankara station January and March 2016: Suicide bombersmurdered tourists from Germany,Israel and Iranin attacks on Istanbul June 2016:Forty-five people were killedin a coordinated attack targeting Turks and foreign visitors alike at Ataturk airport in Istanbul August 2016: A suicide bomber was blamed for murdering 54 people ata wedding party in the southern city of Gaziantep. Twenty-nine of the victims were children 1 January 2017: Gunman kills 39 people at the Reina nightclub in Istanbul Much of the IS violence inside Turkey in recent months, such as the Gaziantep attack, can be put down to reprisal attacks for the Ankara government's policy on Syria. Although Turkey has long backed Syrian rebels, it has become a major player in the conflict in recent months. In August 2016, Turkey launched a campaign against IS in northern Syria and there has been fierce fighting as it tries to seize control of the group's stronghold of al-Bab. Turkey has suffered heavy losses in al-Bab Together with Russia it organised a halt to fighting in Aleppo, and then a nationwide ceasefire in late December. But Turkey had initially been a reluctant participant in the Syrian conflict. PKK leader Cemil Bayik even accused President Recep Tayyip Erdogan of ""protecting IS"", to stop Kurds advancing against the jihadist group and carving out their own territory in Syria. This video can not be played Cemil Bayik says the PKK is open to negotiations, but will not surrender Turkey did nevertheless agree in 2014 to take part in the US-led operation against IS and was seen as part of the Nato alliance targeting its bases in Iraq and Syria. It then sealed off the jihadists' supply of militants crossing over the previously porous border with Syria. When IS bombed a rally of Kurdish peace activists in Suruc in 2015, there was a clear benefit in seeing Turkey drawn into renewed domestic conflict with Kurdish militants. Turkey's security forces have since become bogged down in a military campaign against the PKK in the east and south-east. Curfews were imposed on towns and cities for months in 2016 as the Turkish military hunted down Kurdish militants. Swathes of Turkey's south-east were left in chaos as the military hunted PKK militants Kurdish communities live on both sides of the Turkish border with Syria and have long battled the spread of IS. But Turkey has no interest in seeing Kurdish territorial gains across its border and part of the incentive to seize al-Bab from IS was to prevent Syrian Kurds from increasing their hold in the area. Turkey has vowed to prevent the creation of a contiguous Kurdish autonomous region along its border with Syria. Turkey is particularly worried by the rise of the Syrian Kurdish Popular Protection Units (YPG) militia and its political arm, the Democratic Union Party (PYD). ""Turkey is feeling a very serious existential threat from the PYD and PKK,"" says Burhanettin Duran, executive director of Turkey's pro-governmentSeta research institute,external. ""It's a very solid fact that the PYD and the PKK are the same.""

Is your child a cyberbully?,"One in five teens claims to have been cyberbullied but few admit to being the bully Parents worry about their children being bullied online, but what if it is your child who is doing the bullying? That was the question posed by a BBC reader, followinga report on how children struggle to cope online. There is plenty of information about how to deal with cyberbullies, but far less about what to do if you  find out that your own child is the source. The BBC took advice from experts and a mother who found out her daughter had been cyberbullying her school friends. Nicola Jenkins found out that her 12-year-old daughter was posting unpleasant comments online from her teacher Few parents would want to admit that their child was a bully but Nicola Jenkins has gone on record with her story.You can watch her tell it here,external. ""Nobody thinks that their own child is saying unkind things to other children, do they? I let them go on all the social media sites and trusted the children to use it appropriately. ""Our form tutor phoned me up during school hours one day to tell me that there'd been some messages sent between my daughter and two other friends that weren't very nice. One of the children in particular was very upset about some of the things that had been said to her. ""Her friend's mum spoke to me about it and showed me the messages that had been sent. When I approached my daughter about it, she denied that there had been anything going on. It took a while to get it out of her, but I was angry with her once I actually found out that she had been sending these messages. ""I spoke to her teacher and to the other parents, and between us we spoke to the children to let them know that they can't be saying unkind things and to just make them aware that whatever they do is recorded and can be kept. And they all did learn a lesson from it. ""I removed all the social media websites from her so she wasn't able to access them for a while and then monitored her input and what she's been saying to people. ""But it did make me feel angry and quite ashamed that my daughter could be saying things like that to her friends, but she has grown up a bit since then and she's learnt her lesson. ""You want to trust your children, but they can get themselves into situations that they can't get out of. ""And as they get older, they look at different things. I know my son looks at totally different things to what my daughter does, so it's just being aware of what they are accessing and make sure that they are happy for you to look at what they are looking at as well."" There is plenty of advice for parents on coping with cyberbullying but less on what to do if your child is the bully According to not-for-profit organisation Internet Matters, one in five 13-18 year olds claim to have experienced cyberbullying but there are few statistics on how many children are bullying. Carolyn Bunting, general manager of Internet Matters, offers the following advice: ""First, sit down with them and try to establish the facts around the incident with an open mind. As parents, we can sometimes have a blind spot when it comes to the behaviour of our own children - so try not to be on the defensive. Talk about areas that may be causing them distress or anger and leading them to express these feelings online. ""Make clear the distinction between uploading and sharing content because it's funny or might get lots of 'likes', versus the potential to cause offence or hurt. Tell them: this is serious. It's vital they understand that bullying others online is unacceptable behaviour. As well as potentially losing friends, it could get them into trouble with their school or the police. ""If your child was cyberbullying in retaliation, you should tell them that two wrongs cannot make a right and it will only encourage further bullying behaviour. Stay calm when discussing it with your child and try to talk with other adults to work through any emotions you have about the situation. ""Taking away devices can be counterproductive. It could make the situation worse and encourage them to find other ways to get online. Instead, think about restricting access and take away some privileges if they don't stop the behaviour. ""As a role model, show your child that taking responsibility for your own actions is the right thing to do. Above all, help your child learn from what has happened. Think about what you could do differently as a parent or as a family and share your learning with other parents and carers."" Twitter's image has been tarnished by trolls Many critics blame social media for not doing enough to deal with cyberbullying. Abuse is prolific on Twitter and it has pledged to do more, including improving tools that allow users to mute, block and report so-called trolls. Sinead McSweeney, vice-president of public policy at Twitter, explained why the issue is close to her heart: ""As a mother of a seven-year-old boy, I've always tried to strike the right balance between promoting internet safety and encouraging the type of exploration, learning and creativity that the internet can unlock."" She offered the following advice: ""If you find that your child is participating in this type of behaviour, a good first step is to understand the nature of the type of material they're creating, who is the target, and try to ascertain their motivations. ""If the bullying is taking place on a social media platform, make sure to explain to them why the behaviour is inappropriate and harmful, and to supervise the deletion of the bullying content they have created. If it continues, it may be worth seeking additional advice from a teacher or trusted confidant.""

Berlin truck attack: Can the EU stop another Amri?,"A security check on the France-Germany border on 22 December during the hunt for Anis Amri Germany's security services are under intense scrutiny because of the way Anis Amri, the Tunisian jihadist who killed 12 people in Berlin, evaded their surveillance and crossed European borders undetected. As after the Paris and Brussels attacks in 2015-2016, critics say it is too easy for terrorists to travel in the EU's passport-free Schengen zone. There are fears that so-called Islamic State (IS) - under heavy military pressure in the Middle East - will launch more attacks in the EU. The investigation into the Berlin Christmas market attack of 19 December has exposed several errors or shortcomings: He was a known follower of an Islamist hate preacher, Abu Walaa, but the authorities say they lacked the legal grounds to detain him Germany rejected Amri's asylum request in June, 11 months after he had arrived from Italy; but Tunisia refused to take him back, initially refusing to accept he was Tunisian citizen Amri was initially registered in Kleve, North Rhine-Westphalia, and legally he was supposed to remain there, but he moved to Berlin He used 14 different identities in Germany and was suspected of making multiple fraudulent welfare claims Immediately after Amri's lorry attack police followed a false lead, questioning an innocent Pakistani man as a suspect Only on 3 January did police detain a Tunisian suspect, Bilel A, who had had dinner with Amri on the eve of the attack. Amri's atrocity highlighted the fragmentation of Germany's security and counter-terrorism services. Each of Germany's 16 states has its own police and intelligence service, on top of the federal agencies. It is acknowledged that sometimes important intelligence is not passed on between services. That weakness was blamed in the case of aneo-Nazi cell- part of the National Socialist Underground (NSU) - accused of 10 murders across a decade, in different German cities. The truth finally came out in 2011. Federal Interior Minister Thomas de Maiziere has now called for abroadening of the federal police's security remit,externaland a centralisation of intelligence-gathering. But he faces political resistance - from Bavaria, for example. Whose lives were lost? Polish driver 'shot hours before attack' What we know Who was Anis Amri? Investigators say that after the lorry attack Amri caught several trains which took him from the Netherlands to Italy, via Belgium and France. Those countries are in Schengen - the zone covering most of Europe where passport controls are minimal or non-existent. Schengen: EU free movement deal explained On 21 December German police issued this wanted poster for Anis Amri After the2015 Paris attacksby jihadists, in which 147 people were killed, France, Germany and some other Schengen countries reinstated passport checks at some of the EU's internal borders. France plans to maintain passport checks on all its borders until 15 July, and Germany is also extending its checks on the Austrian border indefinitely. Austria demanded such checks to help curb the huge influx of migrants last year. But the Berlin attack, and thejihadist bombings in Brusselslast March, suggest that the new controls are far from systematic, and that tighter border surveillance may be needed. It was only by chance that Italian policestopped Amri at a Milan station and killed himafter he had opened fire. Anis Amri drove a lorry laden with steel beams into a crowded Christmas market in Berlin The .22-calibre pistol that Amri used to kill the Polish lorry driver and to fire at Italian police Amri was caught by CCTV cameras at train stations in Nijmegen (Netherlands), Brussels (Belgium), Turin and Milan (Italy). But he was able to buy train tickets without revealing his real identity. The Dutch government is reportedly in talks with Belgium and France about increasing security checks on buses, trains and boats. One idea is to require passengers to show ID when buying a ticket. There are demands in Germany now to boost CCTV surveillance - something that was resisted for decades, in part due to Germany's grim memories of state surveillance. The priority last year was to reduce the numbers of refugees and migrants heading for northern Europe from Greece and Italy. AnEU deal with Turkeyin March did sharply cut the numbers making hazardous boat journeys to Greece from Turkey. But the numbers heading for Italy by boat from Libya - where many are victims of violent gangs -have continued rising. In 2015 Germany took in a record 890,000 asylum seekers - many of them refugees from the wars in Syria, Iraq and Afghanistan. Monitoring the Romania-Moldova border: Data exchanges are key to fighting terrorism and organised crime After the Paris attacks it emerged that some of the jihadists had slipped into the EU among crowds of migrants. Belgian citizenAbdelhamid Abaaoud, allegedly the organiser, had boasted about going to war-torn Syria and returning to Belgium. Now the EU recognises the need to link police databases so that potential terrorists are spotted. Tove Ernst, EU Commission spokesperson for migration and home affairs, told the BBC that the EU ""needs to do more and do better when it comes to exchanging information"". The Schengen Information System (SIS) is the most widely used database for intelligence-sharing in the EU. But the UK - not part of Schengen - uses the SIS in a limited way. And the amount of data provided varies greatly from country to country - gaps which the EU is urgently trying to plug. ACommission report,externalin December urged EU states to put all alerts about migrant entry bans or deportation decisions into the SIS. A key problem is that of ""home-grown"" jihadists, such as those responsible for the carnage in Paris. The checks on EU citizens are generally not as systematic as those on migrants from outside the EU. The EU has decided that in future the identities of all travellers - including EU citizens -will be checked against databases at the Schengen zone's borders,external. The terrorist atrocities exposed some weaknesses in national policing - so just blaming Schengen is no solution. The Commission found that national forces' use of the SIS database was uneven - it needed to be systematic. EU countries can act quickly when aEuropean Arrest Warrant (EAW)is issued. But there was a delay in the case of Amri, as police initially pursued a false lead. In 2005 an EAW enabled the UK to quickly extradite from Italy a fugitive bomber, Hussain Osman, over a terror plot in London. Travellers are now checked at the Austria-Germany border - and both are in Schengen A senior EU official in law enforcement told the BBC that ""the willingness to share terrorism data has improved a lot"". The official said France and Belgium, since the 2015-2016 terror attacks, had ""started to share terabytes of information"" with Europol, the EU police agency. According to Ms Ernst, efficient use of counter-terrorism tools ""requires a culture change"" among national forces - ""the habit of systematic co-operation and information-sharing"". Schengen enshrines the EU's cherished principle of free movement. And while the system allows for temporary border controls under special circumstances, the member states are reluctant to reinstate barriers. The Commission estimates that restoring full border controls in Schengen would impose annual costs of â¬5bn-â¬18bn (Â£4bn-Â£15bn) on the members, through border delays, lost tourism and trade blockages. A note on terminology:The BBC uses the term migrant to refer to all people on the move who have yet to complete the legal process of claiming asylum.

What does 2017 have in store for sport?,"After an unforgettable and relentless year for sports news, what does 2017 hold in store? Plenty, as sports editor Dan Roan explains: There's no football World Cup, and it may not be an Olympic year, but expect 2017 to revive fond memories of the London Games, with a host of major sports events on the horizon. Buoyed by Britain's remarkable success in Rio last year, track and field will take centre stage, first at the World ParaAthletics Championships, and then the IAAF World Championships, both held at London's former Olympic Stadium. It is the first time the two events have been held in the same city, and the same summer. It promises to be afitting send-off for triple Olympic champion Usain Bolt,racing competitively for the final time before he retires, and also for double Olympic champion Mo Farah, who says he will focus on the marathon after the worlds. This video can not be played Mo Farah: Future on the road after Rio 2016 With Jessica Ennis-Hill already having retired however, it will be interesting to see whether a new generation of British talent - led by Scotland'sLaura Muir- can make their mark, (and whether Russia will be allowed to compete at all after recent claims of state-sponsored doping). With the world's best team lying in wait, the British and Irish Lions trip to New Zealand is arguably the biggest and most anticipated rugby tour ever, and certain to add even more spice to this year'sSix Nations. With England unbeaten under Eddie Jones and Ireland having recently won against the All Blacks for the first time, coach Warren Gatland can select a strong squad to seriously challenge the hosts. But it will be far from easy. The ultimate rugby challenge awaits against a team that continues to come as close as any in sport to perfection. If there is one place above all others to be covering sport this year, it is Auckland on 24 June for the first Test of what should be a titanic series. 2017 monthly highlights January:Australian Open (tennis) July:Wimbledon (tennis) February:Six Nations (rugby union) August:IAAF World Championships (athletics) March:Australian Grand Prix (Formula 1) September:England v West Indies, Test, T20 and ODI (cricket) April:Masters (golf) October:Rugby League World Cup May:FA Cup final (football) November:England v Australia, Ashes (cricket) June:Champions League final (football) December:King George VI Chase (horse racing) Having come third in the 2015 World Cup, England's women footballers will have high hopes inthe biggest Euros staged to date,,externalwith 16 participants vying for glory in the Netherlands. A mouth-watering opening tie against Scotland in Utrecht on 19 July should ensure significant interest in a competition that is expected to give another major boost to the women's game. This summer will also see England host thewomen's cricket World Cup,,externaland Ireland stage the rugby union World Cup, with England confident of retaining the title they won three years ago. The last time England turned up in Australia for the Ashes, they were humiliated, with batsman Jonathan Trott leaving a shambolic tour early,Graeme Swannretiring mid-series, andKevin Pietersenplaying his last Test before being banished. This time, with the likes of Joe Root and Ben Stokes now firmly established among the world's finest cricketers, they should fare significantly better that the 5-0 whitewash they endured in 2013-14. By the time the series starts in November, Australia will have also hosted rugby league's World Cup, with England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland all involved. Elsewhere, in football it will be fascinating to see who prevails in the Premier League, with the 'big six' clubs having restored the natural order after the Leicester City 'miracle' last season. And there is the climax to qualification for the 2018 World Cup to look forward to as well. England will seek to regain the Women's World Cup title they last won in 2009, this time with Heather Knight captaining the squad Theincredible spending potentialof China's clubs will no doubt continue the power shift in football's transfer market, along with more Chinese investment in English clubs. It is also a big year for sailing, with Sir Ben Ainslie aiming to bring the America's Cup to Britain for the first time. Lewis Hamilton is favourite to claim a fourth world title as F1 prepares for life without last year's winner Nico Rosberg, and withLiberty Mediahoping to complete their multi-billion dollar takeover of the motorsport series, expect change away from the the track too, with much interest in the next move of F1's 86-year-old commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone. In tennis, world number one Andy Murray will attempt to win the Australian Open for the first time, and cycling's Chris Froome will target a fourth Tour de France victory, while Carl Frampton v Leo Santa Cruz and Anthony Joshua v Wladimir Klitschko are the highlights ofa bumper year in boxing. And perhaps we will finally discover ifthe prospect of a mega-fightbetween UFC superstar Conor McGregor and retired unbeaten boxer Floyd Mayweather is anything more than just talk. Doping was the longest-running and biggest single issue in sports news last year, with claims ofRussian state-sponsored cheatinglaid bare in two damning reports by Professor Richard McLaren, the build-up to the Rio Games overshadowed by the scandal, and the suspension of tennis starMaria Sharapova. In 2017, sports' leaders will be under mounting pressure to finally decide how to regain trust in the world's anti-doping regime. When the two International Olympic Committee (IOC) commissions have concluded their work, the organisation must punish Russia. With more positive results from the re-testing of Russian samples from London 2012 and Sochi 2014 expected over the coming weeks, and with the country already having been stripped of thebobsleigh and skeleton World Championshipsin March, should it also be banned from the winter Games next year? Maria Sharapova was Russia's highest-profile athlete to be exposed in the 2016 doping scandal Russia has now admitted some doping took place, but continues to contest any government involvement, and there are serious doubts that it can persuade athletics' governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), to lift its suspension of the country's track and field athletes in time for the World Championships. The long-anticipated reform of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) must also be decided. Will it be granted the autonomy, additional resources, and sanctioning power that many in the anti-doping community are demanding? These are the difficult questions international sport must wrestle with over the coming months as it tries to recover from the worst doping scandal in history. There could be more bad news on the way however, with reports that the names of athletes who had bags of blood confiscated as part ofOperation Puertoin Spain may be revealed. And could the Fancy Bears hackers cause more mayhem with further revelations? For the Football Association, Clive Sheldon QC has become a very important man. The barrister is heading up the governing body'sreview,externalinto allegations of child sexual abuse, and the FA is under mounting pressure to make the findings public, and then to act on them decisively and appropriately. With hundreds of victims coming forward, more than155 suspects identified,and 148 clubs involved - so far - the scale of the scandal is breathtaking. With the possibility of more suspensions of officials, along with the prospect of further criminal charges, and compensation claims, this story will extend well beyond 2017 as British football seeks answers to the worst crisis in its history. Current footballers may have been slow to publicly back the Offside Trust - set up to support the victims of abuse - but the issue of child protection in sport is here to stay. After the most turbulent year in its history, cycling is braced for the conclusion of two separate investigations. UK Sport will shortly announce the findings of an independent review into whether there was a culture of bullying and sexism at governing body British Cycling after a series ofallegationsfrom former riders and employees. Meanwhile, after being questioned by MPs over the circumstances surrounding a medical package delivered to his former rider Sir Bradley Wiggins, the future of one of the country's leading sports coaches - Team Sky supremo Sir Dave Brailsford - will hinge on the outcome of a UK Anti-Doping investigation intoallegations of wrongdoingin the sport. Wiggins recently announced his retirement. But with the parliamentary committee considering calling more witnesses, do not expect the controversy over his use of therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs) before major races to go away. Wiggins' TUEs were approved by British authorities and cycling's world governing body the UCI. The pressure is still on the country's most decorated Olympian - and its most successful sport. The British President of the UCI, Brian Cookson, will seek re-election, while British Cycling must appoint a new chief executive. The countdown to what has the potential to be the most controversial World Cup to date has begun. Organisers of Russia 2018 have already had to defend themselves against accusations of corruption in the bidding process, racist behaviour, and, since those chaotic scenes at last year'sEuros in France,a new generation of hooligans. The recent state-sponsored doping scandal has only intensified calls for Russia to be stripped of football's showpiece event. Lots will be at stake this summer when the nation hosts the Confederations Cup - the traditional dress-rehearsal for the World Cup. For three cities, the clock is ticking down to Wednesday, 13 September. That is when, in Lima, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) will gather amid the usual fanfare, and vote to decide the hosts of the 33rd Olympiad in 2024. Before then, expect eight months of presentations, inspection visits and relentless lobbying. The race is seen as a straight fight between what appear to be two 'safe' candidate cities; Los Angeles and Paris, both bidding to stage the Games for a third time. But the IOC is under serious pressure over the budget-busting costs and questionable legacy benefits of their showpiece event. Could politics in the US and France have an impact on their 2024 Olympics bids? So how better to prove that President Thomas Bach's'Agenda 2020' reforms,external- designed to bring about cheaper, more sustainable Games - are actually working, than to award them to a more modest bid, from a smaller city, like dark horses Budapest? Paris remains the favourite, but with US network NBC paying the IOC billions in broadcast rights, and with the next three Olympics all heading to Asian time zones (especially unfavourable to American TV audiences), LA's supporters are growing increasingly confident that it is their turn. Will a Donald Trump administration harm the US city's chances? Could the possible election of far-right leader Marine Le Pen in France's presidential election in April have a similar impact on Paris? All will be revealed in Peru. The integrity of sport will continue to be a priority for politicians in 2017, with the government committed to a review of the UK Anti-Doping Agency. Also expect significant interest in whether the government's latest sports strategy - intended to tackle inactivity - especially among the poor and children - is making any progress. By April, all sports that want to receive public funding must also show they are taking steps to comply with a new governance code, designed to improve decision-making, transparency and diversity on boards. Sports that controversially lost out in UK Sport's recent divvy-up of National Lottery elite performance funding will have their appeals heard. And with football's abuse scandal emphasising the importance of child protection, Baroness Grey-Thompson's review into sports' duty of care towards athletes will also take on extra significance. With the election of a new president, 2016 was a year of relative calm for Fifa as football's world governing body tried to move on from the scandal that shook it to the core. But later this year, the long-awaited trial of defendants in the wide-ranging corruption case, led by the FBI, begins in New York. There will be other issues of course; from the threat of terrorism, to safe-standing in football, concussion in rugby, mechanical doping in cycling, tax evasion and the rise of e-sports.

'A major bank will fail',"Could a bank go under following a major hacking theft in 2017? If 2016 seemed politically tumultuous, 2017 promises to be equally tumultuous on the technology front. The pace of change is accelerating at a dizzying rate, with profound implications for the way we work, play and communicate. So what are the big technology trends to watch out for in 2017? Cybersecurity will undoubtedly be the dominant theme of 2017, as all tech innovations could be undermined by data thefts, fraud and cyber propaganda. Forget Kim Kardashian, it's hacking that could break the internet - and much more besides. As accusations of Russian interference in the 2016 US presidential election continue to reverberate around the world, hackers - whether private or state-sponsored - would seem to be getting the upper hand. Prof Richard Benham, chairman of the National Cyber Management Centre, gives a dire warning: ""A major bank will fail as a result of a cyber-attack in 2017 leading to a loss of confidence and a run on that bank."" In November last year,hackers stole Â£2.5m from 9,000 Tesco Bank customersin a raid the UK's Financial Conduct Authority described as ""unprecedented"". Last year Tesco Bank seemed to be offering free cash withdrawals to hackers, too And the more connected the world becomes - think connected cars, smart homes, sensor-laden cities - the more opportunities for hackers to break into the system and wreak havoc. ""The internet of things (IoT) and industrial internet of things (IIoT) will play a larger role in targeted attacks in 2017,"" says Raimund Genes, chief technology officer at cybersecurity company Trend Micro. ""These attacks will capitalise upon the growing acceptance of connected devices by exploiting vulnerabilities and unsecured systems to disrupt business processes, as we saw withMirai."" The firm also predicts that throughout 2017 criminals will continue renting out theirransomwareinfrastructures - the tools that enable hackers to break in to your system, encrypt all your data, then demand a ransom to decrypt it. Hackers can achieve the same result by knocking out your website or factory control systems in a DDoS [distributed denial of service] attack - flooding your computer servers with so many requests that they cease functioning. And hackers are not just interested in stealing data and making money from it, warns Jason Hart, chief technology officer in charge of data protection at Gemalto, a digital security company. Are hackers beginning to get the upper hand? They're altering it, with potentially dire consequences. ""It's scary, but data integrity attacks have the power to bring down an entire company and beyond; entire stock markets could be poisoned and collapsed by faulty data. ""The power grid and other IoT systems, from traffic lights to the water supply, could be severely disrupted if the data they run on were to be altered,"" he says. As well as poorly secured devices, gullible humans will continue to be targeted, with so-called ""business email compromise"" fraud continuing to reap rich rewards for criminals, experts predict. Simply tricking employees in to transferring funds to criminals' bank accounts is lo-tech but surprisingly effective, with Trend Micro reporting that the average payout in the US was $140,000 (Â£114,000) last year. ""Cybercriminals are targeting human vulnerabilities,"" says Prof Benham. ""Millions is being spent on technology, but nothing on awareness training."" AI was the buzzword of 2016 and looks set to dominate 2017 as well - for better or worse. Enabling machines to learn, adapt to new circumstances and make decisions for themselves, rather than simply obeying pre-programmed instructions or algorithms, seems to present as many disadvantages as advantages. The pessimists envisage self-programming machines running amok and breaking free of human control, with potentially apocalyptic consequences. This video can not be played Rory Cellan-Jones meets the Alexa-powered robot Lynx But optimists believe that applying a more restrictive, less autonomous form of machine learning to the wealth of data we are now generating and storing in the cloud could help identify correlations and patterns that were impossible for humans to see before. And as more devices and sensors become connected, we will learn even more about the world around us. This ability to make sense of all this data could help us cure disease, tackle climate change, grow food more efficiently and generally run our lives in a much smarter, more sustainable way, proponents believe. Lots was made of customer servicechatbotslast year, sometimes described erroneously as AI in action, but most of these were actually pretty dumb, merely guessing the most likely answer to fit the question. Real AI, underpinned by natural language processing, neural networks and machine learning, will understand how humans think, talk, and categorise concepts, making it smarter and easier to interact with. And the more people who use it, the more data it will have to learn from and the better it will become. So we are likely to see a proliferation of smarter virtual assistants, such as Amazon's Alexa, Google's Assistant, Microsoft's Cortana, Apple's Siri, and newcomers like Viv. This video can not be played Olly the robot develops a different personality to suit each of its users Businesses will use their own versions of these AI assistants to make sense of all the data they now have to cope with. ""With AI we have the opportunity to build decision-support systems that see, hear, understand and collaborate with us to help make decisions faster, more relevant and better informed,"" says Gayle Sheppard, general manager of Saffron Technology, an Intel-owned cognitive computing firm. Of course, these always-on listening devices connected to the cloud pose another potential security threat, not to mention privacy concerns over what happens to all the data they're hoovering up. And another worry about AI is that hackers will have access to it as well - it's a cybersecurity arms race. ""AI will power malware, and will use data from the target to send phishing emails that replicate human mannerisms and content,"" warns Andy Powell, head of cybersecurity at Capgemini UK, an IT consultancy. ""Seeming more lifelike, these AI powered attacks will resonate with the target better than ever before, meaning they'll be more likely to fall victim."" There's simply no escaping the cybersecurity issue in 2017. While Pokemon Go showed how augmented or mixed reality tech could take the mobile gaming world by storm, 2017 is likely to see more businesses adopting the technology, too. The marketing opportunities are obvious, with companies like BMW linking up with Accenture and Google Tango to create an app that lets customers visualise what various car models would look like in real-world situations. Augmented reality applications should grow in popularity this year Lots of other retailers will be using it to enhance their marketing. But there are plenty of industrial and educational applications, too, with smart glasses and head-up displays enabling workers to follow instructions, read manuals and navigate workplaces more efficiently. Virtual reality is still primarily for gaming, but when lighter, faster headsets are combined withhaptic technologies, training and teaching applications will become more viable, too. As AI increasingly takes over from call centre and customer service staff, and automation continues its takeover of manufacturing, the big question is what new jobs there will be for all these redundant workers. We've already seen how the effects of globalisation and automation have stirred up voters in the US and potentially across Europe this year. If robots are going to take many of our jobs, what are we going to do instead? Could there be a new Luddite revolution brewing? After all, who benefits most from cheaper production? It's certainly not the poor. ""We're going to start confronting some hard truths about technology and the labour force,"" says Tien Tzuo, founder of subscription technology platform Zuora. ""We're going to have to figure out how to create jobs for people in this new economy, and if there literally are going to be fewer jobs, then we'll need to establish some sort of living standard or basic income for people."" So 2017 could also be the year the world is forced to deal - finally - with the tangible impacts of technology upon human society. Follow Matthew onTwitter,externalandFacebook,external.

Clearing up Christmas,"The lights come down for another year, but is there a proper time to dismantle Christmas? Misfortune apparently befalls anyone who keeps Christmas decorations up a minute after Twelfth Night - but it can fall on 5 January or 6 January, according to different traditions. So what are the rules for taking down the tree and tinsel? There is no definite date for Twelfth Night, but it marks the beginning of Epiphany on 6 January, the Christian feast day when observers celebrate the visit to Jesus by the Magi - commonly known as the Three kings, or Wise Men. The hashtag #Epiphany is trending on Twitter as those taking their decorations down for another year share post-holiday blues. But others believe Twelfth Night marks the end of Christmas, which logically falls on 5 January if the 12 nights are counted from Christmas Day night itself. To add to the confusion, while Anglicans mark Twelfth Night on 5 January, other churches wait until the following day. Epiphany - also known as Three Kings' Day - recalls how the star led the wise men to baby Jesus. The Church of England celebrates the season of Epiphany from 6 January to 2 February. We are now told the Wise Men could have arrived many weeks later, but 6 January traditionally used to be a day of drinking and parades in Britain. The 17th Century diarist Samuel Pepys recalls filling his house with friends, ""extraordinary Musick"" and ""good fires and candles"" on the day. The Three Wise Men wave to crowds gathered in Madrid in Spain to celebrate the feast of Epiphany ""And so to dancing again, and singing, with extraordinary great pleasure, till about two in the morning,"" he wrote on 6 January 1668. Another year, he was served 18 mince pies at a friend's Epiphany dinner. But like today, Pepys held that 6 January marked the final day of celebrations. ""This night making an end wholly of Christmas,"" he wrote on 6 January 1663. More than 350 years later, many modern Britons would agree with him. Rev Dr Duncan MacLaren, a regular on BBC Radio 4's Prayer for the Day, explains: ""Epiphany remembers the visit of the Magi, who came to Jesus bearing gifts - gold and frankincense and myrrh."" ""I wonder what Mary and Joseph thought of this bizarre scene,"" he says. Epiphany is also a moment of ""sudden realisation"", he adds. ""It derives from the Greek word, meaning 'to reveal'."" This video can not be played Russians across the country take the plunge But while Britons rush to take the decorations down on Epiphany, in mainland Europe families are celebrating by taking the day off and exchanging presents. In Spain and Latin America, ""El DÃ­a de los Reyes"" is just as significant as Christmas. The night before, children leave drinks for the Three Kings and the streets are packed with parades and fireworks displays. Swimming in icy wateris a traditional way for the Russian observers to celebrate Epiphany, which in Eastern Churches falls on 19 January rather than 6 January, due to the older Julian calendar. For others, the coming of Epiphany means the decorations should go down before the clock strikes midnight - on January 5. Because 25 December is the first of the Twelve Days of Christmas according to the Anglican tradition, Twelfth Night falls on this day. Twelfth Night has long marked the close of the Christmas season, to the extent that William Shakespeare intended his play of the same name to be performed on the day for this reason. That said, the first recorded performance of Twelfth Night was on 2 February, the end of the season of Epiphany, in Middle Temple Hall in London - by which time last year's tree should be long gone.

Affleck Oscar?,"Manchester by the Sea has won 70 awards including being named best film of 2016 at the US National Board of Review's awards Golden Globe nominated actor Casey Affleck says that he ""got lucky"" to get his part in drama Manchester by the Sea - after replacing his friend Matt Damon at the last minute. Damon, the star of the Bourne franchise, was originally going to direct and star in the film, which is nominated for five Golden Globe awards. But scheduling meant he had to pull out of both roles, remaining as a producer. Affleck believes that ""there aren't many parts like this"". And that's even for male actors at the height of their career. ""It's so exhilarating and fun to get a part like this,"" he explains. ""You get to do what you thought you'd do when you first started being an actor. The reality is, you end up doing so much stuff you thought you'd never have to do, and would never want to do again."" Affleck plays Boston janitor Lee, who, having suffered painful tragedy in his own life, has to return to his home town of Manchester by the Sea to take care of his teenage nephew, following the death of his brother. Director Kenneth Lonergan has been nominated for two Oscars for writing Gangs of New York and You Can Count on Me The film was written and directed by Kenneth Lonergan, who was nominated for an Oscar for his writing on Martin Scorsese's Gangs of New York. ""The truth is there's so much media out there, so much TV, and there's a lot of material written for comedies and dramas, but there are very few things that have been brewing for years in the way Kenny writes things,"" the actor claims. ""It's the antithesis of what our culture has come to be, I mean our Western pop culture of churning it out and gobbling it up. There are also a lot of great actors out there, and sometimes those scripts go to other people. I got lucky."" Affleck, who was nominated for an Oscar in 2008 for his role in The Assassination of Jesse James by the Coward Robert Ford, grew up in the Massachusetts area where the film is set, along with his brother Ben and neighbour, Matt Damon. Affleck says he was ""aware of the project for some time"" and knew Damon was working on it. ""When they asked me to do the part I said, 'Sure, that might mean we never get it made, but I'm honoured that you asked.' It was very clear to me that it was the kind of movie I would love even if no-one else did."" However, not only did the film receive glowing reviews after its debut at the Sundance Film Festival last year, but Affleck is the favourite to receive the Globe for best actor in a drama. The film is also nominated for best screenplay, best director, best motion picture drama, and his co-star Michelle Williams is up for best supporting actress. She plays Affleck's ex-wife, and confesses that she ""burst into tears"" when she got the role. Casey Affleck won best actor at the Critics' Choice Awards and director Kenneth Lonergan won best original screenplay (tied with Damien Chazelle for La La Land) while Lucas Hedges won best young actor ""I'd wanted to work with Kenny for so long,"" she says. ""Casey and I had actually read for a play with him years ago. I was pregnant with my daughter at the time. Just knowing that it was finally going to happen, that we were all going to work together - I got a little tearful, yes. ""It felt like a momentous occasion when you want something and it comes true, even when you have to wait a long time. ""Casey and Kenny are good men and more than anything I am really happy to see their toil and efforts come good at this end because they deserve it. Casey looked like he carried the weight of the world on his shoulders when we were making it."" The drama is a study in grief, and how the three main characters, played by Williams, Affleck and Lucas Hedges as Lee's nephew Patrick, deal with their losses. Affleck agrees that ""there were bright spots in the experience"" and ""a lot of light in the film"", but admits it was a ""demanding role"". ""Talking about acting sounds so precious and pretentious, it's almost unbearable, but there was a lot required emotionally - showing up there, and being able to be very upset and sad and tortured, yet contain it all, and keep it tight."" Michelle Williams and Casey Affleck have both been nominated for Golden Globes Kenneth Lonergan has received critical praise for not providing a so-called ""Hollywood answer"" to suffering, calling such stories ""dishonest fantasies"". ""Nobody needs me to tell anyone that real life can be difficult enough without watching something that tells you that everything will be OK, and in time you will understand about the circle of life and all this palaver,"" he says.

However, Michelle Williams believes that Manchester by the Sea does offer ""a glimmer of hope"" in its portrayal of bereavement. ""I think ultimately one of the things the movie is about is endurance. After hard times, you have to find ways to cleave to life and to people, even when you feel there isn't any hope.

Economy dominates amid 'Michael Fish' moment,"Michael Fish giving his infamous weather forecast in 1987 Nearly 30 years after that famous broadcast in which he dismissed reports that a hurricane was about to batter the south of England, former BBC weatherman Michael Fish is being compared with the failures of economic forecasters. The admission by a top Bank of England official that economists failed to predict the 2008 financial crisis and were wrong about their dire warnings over the post-Brexit economy, make the lead for theTimes,external,Telegraph,externalandGuardian,external. They highlight the comment by the Bank's chief economist, Andy Haldane, that the shortcomings were a ""Michael Fish moment"" for the profession. The Guardian says Mr Haldane is known to be concerned about mounting criticism of experts and the potential for the Bank's forecasts to be dismissed by politicians if errors persist. According to the lead in theFinancial Times,external, the appointment of Sir Tim Barrow as Britain's ambassador to the EU following the resignation of Sir Ivan Rogers  was ""vigorously opposed"" by the top official at the Brexit ministry. Several unnamed officials have told the paper that Olly Robbins, permanent secretary at the department, wanted to take control of negotiations with Brussels, and suggested downgrading the job of UK ambassador to a director-general, with a reporting line to Mr Robbins. But, the paper goes on, the Foreign Office sees it as a vital diplomatic post and moved to block Mr Robbins. The Department for Brexit tells the paper the claims are ""fundamentally untrue."" For its main story, theMail says senior civil servants have made an extraordinary demand for extra cash to deal,externalwith Brexit. According to the paper, the Whitehall mandarins and diplomats say the vote to leave the EU has left them facing ""unsustainable"" pressure. It says the First Division Association - a union representing elite civil servants earning up to Â£208,000 - has called for an end to the system that limits increases to 10% for officials who win promotion and a lifting of the 1% pay cap. ""Sir Humphreys' Brexit greed"", is the headline. The Mail also gives over much of its front page to a tribute to Jill Saward,external, the woman raped at an Ealing vicarage in 1986 who went on to campaign for the police and courts to treat victims better. She died on Thursday at the age of 51. The paper thinks it is a disgrace that she never received an honour. Ealing rape victim Jill Saward waived her right to anonymity ""Doesn't it say it all about our rotten honours system that while vapid celebrities and self-serving mandarins are showered with gongs, a woman of grit and integrity who immeasurably improved the lives of countless others got nothing?"" it asks. The Mirror says she was,externalinspiring, courageous and remarkable. Finally, there is some timely advice on how to avoid falling on icy surfaces - march like a penguin. According to the Times,external, penguins may look silly as they waddle around on their stubby legs but their walk is the ideal way to stay safe in cold weather. No slips: Penguins appear to push their centre of gravity forward A German study has found that penguins manage to stay upright by leaning forward so the centre of gravity lies on their front leg, whereas we usually split our weight between two legs - causing them to lose balance on slippery surfaces.

Scotland's only elephant seeks friend,"This video can not be played Scotland's only elephant is in search of a new companion The home of Scotland's only elephant has launched a search to find her a friend after the death of her long-term companion. Mondula, known as Mondy, has been on her own at Blair Drummond Safari Park near Stirling since neighbourToto died aged 46last March. The park is now in contact with zoos across Europe to find company for the ""cheeky and clever"" 46-year-old. Mondy and Toto lived together for almost 20 years. Blair Drummond Safari Park education officer Katie Macfarlane said that, despite not being the closest of friends, Mondy was affected by Toto's death. She told the BBC Scotland news website: ""For a few days she was quite sad and upset and you could tell she was wondering what had happened. ""In the family groups in the wild it has been seen that they mourn each other, but Toto and Mondy weren't related. So, there were was a bond in the sense that they are very intelligent animals, but it wasn't a family bond."" Mondy has been at the park since 1998 Mondy and Toto were together for almost 20 years The keepers have been working with Mondy every day through training to keep her stimulated following the loss of Toto. Miss Macfarlane said: ""In the first wee while she was a bit upset and she lost a bit of weight but she's doing really well now."" Any potential new companion will need to be an older African elephant which recognises Mondy's dominant nature. Miss Macfarlane said: ""It's her house, she's lived here for 20-odd years, so you've got to make sure that they're going to let her be the boss to a certain extent. ""The keepers would never want her to be on her own for the rest of her retirement, so it was always a thought from day one. ""But it takes time. You can't just throw elephants together and expect them to be friends."" Any potential new companion will need to recognise Mondy's dominant nature Toto died after collapsing at the park last year Mondy's new companion will be introduced to her gradually, with the pair initially being kept in separate enclosures. Miss Macfarlane said the keepers were now trying ""really hard"" to find a new friend for Mondy. She said: ""The elephant building that we currently have was built in 2013 and was specifically designed as a retirement home almost. ""We work constantly with a lot of zoos through breeding programmes and the park managers are in touch with all the zoos that have African elephants in Europe. ""We said since we lost Toto that it wouldn't be immediate and it wouldn't be healthy for Mondy for it to be immediate. ""We have to give her a bit of time to get used to the new situation.""

The Bank's 'Michael Fish' moment,"BBC weather presenter Michael Fish reading the signs available to him ""The only function of economic forecasting,"" JK Galbraith once said, ""is to make astrology look respectable."" With disarming honesty, the Bank of England's chief economist, Andrew Haldane, has admitted that criticisms that economic forecasts had been wrong before the financial crisis and wrong about the immediate impact of a Brexit vote were a ""fair cop"". The profession, he said, was facing a crisis of confidence. Mr Haldane went on to describe the failure to understand the impact of the collapse of Lehman Brothers in 2008 as the profession's ""Michael Fish moment"" - when the weather forecaster suggested in 1987 there wasn't a hurricane on the way before record high winds devastated large parts of the south east of England. To be clear, Mr Haldane was talking about economists as a whole - not just the Bank - and said he still fundamentally agreed with the Bank's central forecast - made last November - that 2017 and 2018 could see a ""material"" slowdown in economic activity and a significant rise in inflation. The Bank was right to suggest that sterling would fall in value following a Brexit vote. But, consumer confidence has held up far more robustly than expected and, yet again, it is clear that while economic models can make reasoned judgements about the future, those judgements can prove erroneous. Particularly when they attempt to account for ""shock"" events - the financial crisis (when forecasts undercooked the effects) or the vote to leave the European Union (when models over-cooked the short term effects and failed to account for ""dynamic"" policy responses such as the Bank itself cutting interest rates to new record lows). Mr Haldane said that economists could learn from meteorologists, who now use much more data to understand how weather patterns develop. Meteorology is, of course, a science. Economics is a study, ultimately, of human behaviour - what millions, billions, of people may or may not do, given a certain set of circumstances. Making judgements on that is always going to be a tricky, imprecise business. Star gazing - more respectable than economics?

"Anthony Zurcher: Obama's presidency, grades A to F","It's almost time to close the book on Barack Obama's eight years as president. Before he relocates to Washington's posh Kalorama neighbourhood, however, here's a take on what he tried to do - and how well he did it. Although there are letter grades attached to each section, these assessments are not a reflection of the wisdom of his actions, only in how well he was able to advance his agenda over the course of his presidency. While a liberal might give his environmental policy high marks, a conservative would likely flunk him. What can't be argued, however, is that he accomplished a considerable amount during his eight years. Going unmeasured are a number of Mr Obama's intangible or indirect accomplishments. While the White House sported rainbow-colouring the night after gay marriage became legal nationwide, that was the result of a Supreme Court decision not presidential action. And while Mr Obama often spoke movingly about race relations in the US, particularly after the shooting at a black church in South Carolina, there was little in the way of policy elements accompanying his words. Mr Obama does have an ample record to judge, however. Here's a look at eight key areas - along with consideration of their ""Trump-ability"" - how easy it will be for incoming president Donald Trump to undo what Mr Obama has accomplished. TellAnthony on Twitter @awzurcher,externalhow you would grade Barack Obama's presidency. Comprehensive healthcare reform had been the Democratic Party's holy grail for decades, always seemingly just out of reach. Under Mr Obama, they finally claimed the prize. Due to an electoral setback in the Senate before the bill's final passage, however, the massive piece of legislation was a half-baked cake, making implementation a challenge. The federal healthcare insurance marketplace website, essentially unusable for months after launch, was a very visible, politically devastating mistake. To the surprise of Democrats, many Republican-controlled states opted not to expand Medicaid healthcare coverage for the poor. More recently, insurance premiums for exchange-based policies will increase markedly in some US states - which will be a financial blow to less affluent Americans not covered by government subsidies. Much of the law operated as intended, however. The percentage of Americans without insurance dropped from 15.7% in 2011 to to 9.1% in 2015. More than 8.8 million Americans have signed up for coverage through the federal exchange in the current enrolment period - a record high. Insurers can't deny individuals coverage for their pre-existing medical conditions, and there are no lifetime dollar caps on coverage. Despite its shortcomings, passage of the Affordable Care Act, in the words of Vice-President Joe Biden, was a big expletive-ing deal. Presidential grade:B+ Trump-ability:Republicans have been trying to repeal the Affordable Care Act from the moment Mr Obama signed it into law. Mr Trump regularly condemned the programme as a failure. Now, Republicans are setting the wheels in motion to tear up the reforms ""root and branch"", in Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell's words. Republicans will be able to shred the programme even with their slim majority in the Senate thanks to presidential authority and legislative manoeuvres. Enacting a replacement plan, however, will be more difficult. At the moment, they seem determined to jump off the repeal bridge without figuring out exactly where they will land, but Mr Trumphas cautioned,externalhis congressional colleagues to be careful with how they go about the task. Mr Obama's administration helped negotiate the Paris climate agreement, in which the US joined 185 countries in pledging to cut greenhouse gas emissions. It enacted a host of new regulations governing pollution from coal-fired power plants and limiting coal mining and oil and gas drilling both on federal lands and in coastal waters. Mr Obama also used his executive authority to designate 548 million acres of territory as protected habitat - more than any prior president. The past eight years weren't without missed opportunities, however. Early in his administration, when Democrats had large majorities in Congress, the House of Representatives passed a stringent cap-and-trade programme for controlling carbon emissions. The Senate focused on financial and healthcare reform first, however, and the Democratic majority was gone before they could take action. That may be as close as Democrats come to any sort of comprehensive environmental legislation for a great many years. Presidential grade:A- Trump-ability:US participation in the Paris accord is still uncertain given that the president-elect promised to abandon it. While the withdrawal procedure is supposed to take four years, Mr Trump's team is reportedly searching for ways to speed up the process. Other Obama-era executive accomplishments, however, will be more difficult to roll back. Proposed regulatory changes will require an extended approval process and are sure to face a flurry of lawsuits from environmental groups. Congress could speed things up, but Democrats in the Senate have enough votes to block their efforts if they stick together. Mr Obama made completion of two major trade agreements - the Trans-Pacific Partnership and the Transatlantic Trade and Investment Partnership - the cornerstone of his second term in office. The TPP is destined for the dustbin without even consideration by the US Congress, thanks to a coalition of opposition from Democratic left and the economic nationalists who are sweeping to power with Mr Trump. The TTIP, which is still in negotiation and attempts to reduce trade barriers between the US and the EU, is being abandoned by politicians on both sides of the Atlantic. The Obama administration did successfully implement free trade agreements with Panama, Colombia and South Korea, but they are dwarfed by the size and scope of the now-doomed regional deals. Presidential grade:D- Trump-ability:Mr Trump can and will give a death blow to any hopes Mr Obama may have had of cementing a lasting trade legacy through the TPP and TTIP. More than that, the new president is poised to roll back the trade legacies of previous presidents, as he's pledged to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement - which was concluded under President Bill Clinton - or perhaps even withdraw from the deal entirely. His promises to enact draconian import tariffs on some foreign goods would also run counter to US commitments to the World Trade Organization, which could undermine the entire foundation of the current global trade regime. When Mr Obama took office, the US economy was in freefall. Unemployment had spiked to double digits, housing prices had collapsed and the financial industry teetered on the brink of collapse. The picture eight years later is one of stability and modest growth, although critics will argue that things could be better (and blue-collar Trump voters in the industrial states seemed to agree). Policy-wise, Mr Obama pushed through a major stimulus package and financial reform legislation early in his first term. His administration oversaw a support structure that saved General Motors from a bankruptcy that would have devastated the US auto industry. The Home Affordable Refinance Program, run by the Federal Housing Finance Agency, allowed several million US homeowners to avoid foreclosure and refinance high-interest mortgages. The president negotiated an agreement that rolled back many of the George W Bush era tax cuts in exchange for across-the-board spending freezes. He frequently called for a raise in the federal minimum wage, but he was unable to generate any support for such actions in the Republican-controlled Congress. Although the stock market is reaching new highs, 2015 household income is still below what it was in 2007. Considering where his presidency started, however, the current state of economic health is perhaps the president's most noteworthy legacy. Presidential grade:A Trump-ability:Republicans cutting taxes when they hold power is as certain as the sun rising in the east. Tax-reform, which will likely include a return to Bush-era rates along with even more substantive changes, appear all but certain for passage. Mr Obama's financial reform legislation also could be poised for weakening, as it was frequently the target of Mr Trump's anti-regulation ire. Although conservatives liked to criticise Mr Obama's efforts to bolster US companies as ""picking winners and losers"", early evidence (Carrier, Ford Motors, etc) indicates that's one tradition Mr Trump appears likely to continue, albeit with a sharper edge for businesses that don't comply to his wishes. Mr Obama will leave the White House with two prominent feathers in his foreign policy cap - the Iran nuclear deal and normalised relations with Cuba. Say what you will about the merits of the accomplishments (and many have), they represent a notable thawing in relations between the US and two long-time antagonists. He also oversaw the drawdown of US forces in Iraq and Afghanistan - fulfilling a key campaign promise. Elsewhere, however, the president's international policy has been characterised by strained relations and festering problems. His planned ""reset"" of US-Russian relations upon taking office was followed by the nation's Ukrainian intervention and allegations of meddling in the 2016 US presidential election. The Arab Spring uprisings that began in 2010 spread unrest throughout the Middle East, culminating in a Syrian Civil War that facilitated the rise of the so-called Islamic State and a devastating refugee crisis that has roiled European politics. North Korea continues to develop its nuclear weapons programme seemingly undeterred, and Mr Obama's plans for an ""Asian pivot"" in US foreign policy have done little to keep Chinese regional ambitions in check. Responsibility for this global unrest can't all be laid at Mr Obama's feet, of course, but it's a mark on his permanent record nonetheless. Presidential grade:C+ Trump-ability:Mr Trump has criticised the Iranian nuclear deal, although unlike some other Republicans he hasn't vowed to abandon it entirely. He may find renegotiating the multi-party agreement more difficult than he might think. As for Cuba, he has the executive authority to roll back all of Mr Obama's diplomatic overtures to the communist island, including relaxed sanctions and travel restrictions - although he's kept his options open so far. The president-elect also seems more likely to favour closer relations to Israel and a renewed attempt at improving relations with Russia (a re-reset). In Syria, he has criticised Mr Obama's actions but hasn't advocated a coherent counter-policy, so there's no telling how - or if - he'll change course. One thing is for certain, however. At least rhetorically the Trump administration will be a marked departure from Mr Obama's internationalist foreign policy, which leaned heavily on co-operation and co-ordination with allies. The long-term trend of declining crime rates continued over the past eight years, although a number of large cities have seen a recent uptick in their murder rates. While public safety was a 2016 campaign issue, much of Mr Obama's efforts while president were directed atcriminal justice reform,external. In 2010 he signed a law that brought the mandatory minimum prison time for crack cocaine possession - which disproportionately involves black drug offenders - more in line with powder cocaine sentences. In January 2016, Mr Obama took a series of executive actions to limit the use of solitary confinement in federal prisons and provide greater treatment for inmates with mental health issues.  He has also used his presidential power to commute the sentences of more than 1,000 non-violent drug offenders and supported a Justice Department policy that resulted in the early release of about 6,000 individuals. Although Mr Obama has backed bipartisan sentencing reform legislation in Congress, the 2016 presidential election - and Mr Trump's tough-on-crime rhetoric - has been attributed with frustrating those efforts. Gun control wasn't a top priority for Mr Obama when he took office, but in the early months of his second term - after the 2012 mass shooting of schoolchildren in Newtown, Connecticut - Mr Obama made a strong push for greater restrictions on some types of military-style semi-automatic rifles and more thorough background checks for firearm purchases. Those efforts ran head-on into the National Rifle Association's formidable lobbying power, however, and aside from a few executive actions, no new policies were enacted. In 2015, Mr Obama told the BBC that his failure in this area was hisgreatest frustrationas president. Presidential grade:B- Trump-ability:Given that Mr Trump regularly painted a bleak picture of crime levels in the US, lamented that law enforcement was too constrained by ""political correctness"" and opined that prison inmates were being treated too well, it's safe to say he will pursue a decidedly different course on public safety than Mr Obama. Sentencing reform - in limbo for the past year - will be an exceedingly low priority for Republicans in Congress now, and Mr Obama's gun-control executive actions are likely to face the chopping block. There was a point, shortly after Mr Obama's re-election in 2012, where comprehensive immigration reform seemed inevitable. The president and his fellow Democrats were in favour, and rattled Republicans saw granting permanent residency to some undocumented workers and streamlining the US immigration system as a means to curry favour with the growing bloc of Hispanic voters. A grass-roots revolt within the Republican Party derailed those plans, prompting Mr Obama to take a series of executive actions providing normalised status to undocumented immigrants who entered the US as children and the immigrant families of US citizens and permanent residents. (The latter policy has since been suspended during a protracted legal battle over its constitutionality.) While these efforts attracted widespread praise from pro-immigration activists and Hispanic groups, the Obama administration's policy of increasing removal of other undocumented immigrants has prompted some to call him the ""deporter in chief"". From 2009 to 2015, the Obama administration deported more than 2.5 million people - most of whom had been convicted of some form of criminal offence or were recent arrivals. Presidential grade:B Trump-ability:Mr Trump may very well drop the US defence of the portion of Mr Obama's immigration action that's currently under legal challenge. He could also unilaterally resume deportation of others given normalised status by Mr Obama's executive efforts, although that will be more controversial. The president-elect has pledged to deport more than three million undocumented immigrants currently living in the US - including visitors who have overstayed their visas - although given Mr Obama's track record it may be a difference of extent, not substance. At one point, Mr Trump was pledging to remove everyone not lawfully in the US - more than 11 million by most estimates - which would be a marked departure not just from Mr Obama's policies but those of every modern US president. Whatever his other successes during his time in office, Mr Obama's presidency was a beating for the Democratic Party. In 2009, when Mr Obama was swept to power, Democrats had large majorities in the US Congress and control of 29 of 50 governorships. Since then, he has seen his party's power steadily erode. The House of Representatives has been in Republican hands since 2010; the Senate since 2014. Democrats control the governor's mansion in only 16 states. The situation is even more dire in state legislatures - the proving grounds for young politicians with national ambitions. Republicans hold sway in 32 legislatures, while Democrats have majorities in only 12 (the rest are divided). If the party doesn't make inroads in places like Pennsylvania, Ohio, Michigan, Florida and Wisconsin by 2020, those legislatures will draw congressional district maps that make recapturing the House of Representatives a tall task for Democrats for another decade. Mr Obama's political constituency - young voters and minorities - proved enough to win him the presidency twice, but it was a fragile coalition that could not be counted on in mid-term congressional and legislative elections or, for that matter, by Hillary Clinton last year. While Mr Obama can boast considerable accomplishments over his eight years in office, if his party can't regain its footing after a string of devastating electoral setbacks, he won't have any legacy worth writing about before too long. Presidential grade:F Trump-ability:Barring a major political realignment in the liberal fortress of California, things can't get much worse for Democrats at the state level. In Congress, however, Mr Trump has a decent shot at expanding the Republican Senate majority in 2018, given that Democrats have to defend 10 seats in states that Mr Trump won last year. There's always the chance that Republicans could overreach in their efforts to enact their agenda. An economic decline or foreign policy fiasco could tank Mr Trump's approval rating and make winners of even unlikely Democrats. The durability of Mr Trump's own political coalition of disaffected working-class whites, evangelicals and other traditional Republican voters is still an open question as well.

Jonty Bloom: Productivity gap yawns across UK,"Tower Hamlets - which includes Canary Wharf - is the most productive part of the UK Productivity, or more precisely the lack of productivity, is one of the great puzzles of the British economy at the moment. Productivity growth since the credit crunch has been dreadful and that matters, because unless we make more and work more efficiently we cannot pay ourselves more. In an attempt to understand what is going wrong, the Office for National Statistics (ONS) is bringing all its productivity statistics together and conducting new research. It throws up some interesting details and possible explanations about what is going wrong. Output per hour worked increased by 0.4% in the three months to September last year, that is an improvement but according to (ONS) economist Richard Heys: ""It is still weak compared to that experienced in the recent past."" Part of the reason for low productivity lies in Britain's regions. While London and south-eastern England have productivity well above the national average and equal to the levels seen in rival economies like France and Germany, the rest of the country lags behind. Tower Hamlets, which includes the financial district of Canary Wharf, is the most productive part of the country, a huge 79% more productive than average. Powys in central Wales is the least productive and, overall, Wales and Northern Ireland have productivity levels 19% below the national average. The only towns in the country that have above average productivity are London, Aberdeen (centre of the off-shore oil industry) and Bristol (a high tech and aviation industry hub). The Bristol area is one of the most productive in the country The least productive city is Sheffield, once home to a huge steel industry but now lagging well behind; Sheffield is 19% less productive than the national average. This part of the productivity puzzle is perhaps the best understood. The most productive industry is finance and that is concentrated in London, while many regions suffer from poor infrastructure and communications and have never recovered from the loss of major parts of their economy in previous decades: mining, heavy engineering, ship building and many more. Perhaps more interesting, is new research by the ONS into the efficiency of family-owned and run manufacturing firms. That found well-structured management practices were better among larger businesses, multinationals and family-owned businesses that were not managed by members of the owning families. To put it bluntly the management of family-run firms (which make up more than half of all manufacturing companies) is awful. Even a small improvement in management would see a huge boost in productivity in such businesses. At first sight this might seem strange, but there is a fairly obvious explanation. What are the odds that the best-qualified and most competent person in the world to run a business just happens to be the son or daughter of the current boss? As one economist has put it, this is like selecting the children of previous gold medallists to be members of the country's next Olympic team, rather than picking the best athletes. There is also the issue of how such companies will attract top staff if they know nepotism means they will never make it to the top, which helps explain why the handling of promotions was one of the issues most associated with productivity. Solving the productivity gap in the UK will not be an easy job, certainly better regional policies would help, but just convincing family- run firms to appoint competent outsiders to run their business would also have a huge effect.

David Sillito: The lost sounds of Stonehenge,"There are many questions surrounding the ancient stone circle of Stonehenge but might sound help in the search for answers? Thomas Hardy said it had a strange ""musical hum"". Tess of the d'Urvbervilles ends at Stonehenge and features the ""sound"".  Modern-day druids also say they experience something special when they gather at Stonehenge and play instruments within the stone circle. However, Stonehenge is a ruin. Whatever sound it originally had 3,000 years ago has been lost but now, using technology created for video games and architects, Dr Rupert Till of the University of Huddersfield has - with the help of some ancient instruments - created a virtual sound tour of Stonehenge as it would have sounded with all the stones in place. This video can not be played Listen to Stonehenge's hidden sounds Arriving at 07:00 on a decidedly chilly January morning, I was sceptical. Dr Till had arrived with a horn, a drum and some sticks to try to show me that, even in its partially deconstructed state, there was still a distinctive echo. Perhaps it's the mystique of the stones but it's easy to hear something. However, sound is always going to bounce off huge standing stones: how can we say that was in any way meaningful for people 3,000 years ago? Dr Till says there's a great deal of evidence that ancient people were intrigued and drawn to places that had a distinctive sound and Stonehenge had a ""strange acoustic"". Even today, the wind or drumming can, he says, help generate a 47hz bass note. Dr Rupert Till uses a drum to demonstrate Stonehenge's acoustics He first got a taste of what the circle might do to sound when he visited a concrete replica of the original intact Stonehenge in Maryhill in the US state of  Washington. He has now developed an app which will help people blot out the sounds - including those made by tourists, and cars on the nearby A303 - and go back to the soundscape of 3,000 years ago. He's used instruments that were used at the time, such as bone flutes and animal horns, to give people a sense of what music would have sounded like within the reverberation of the intact stone circle and says the site has some of the characteristics you might expect of a rock concert venue. Dr Till explains that there's there's strong evidence that people several thousand years ago had an interest in acoustic environments. He's worked on caves in Spain in which instruments have been found deep underground. The echoes of the tunnels and cave systems may have had a special meaning for people. There are also, what appears to be, human markings on certain ""musical"" stalactites. Strike the stalactites in the right way and they give off a deep resonant note and can be played like a huge vertical xylophone. Virtual reality allows new ways to examine Stonehenge's history Stonehenge is a magnet for strange theories but this reflects a wider movement within archaeology to try to recreate the past with the rapidly growing technology of virtual reality (VR). Dr Aaron Watson is a research archaeologist and specialises in visualising the past. VR, he says, opens up a new way of researching history. ""The material record can't give us all the answers,"" he explains. ""The moment we start creating a virtual reality world it begins to ask questions, especially about people. What were they wearing, what were their postures, were they highly coloured, tattooed? As soon as we create the immersive experience it demands those answers. ""It gives a new sensory experience to looking at the past that might take us beyond what we describe in books."" How hard was it to build Stonehenge?

Apology over Ant and Dec game errors,"Ant & Dec have hosted Saturday Night Takeaway on ITV since 2002 The makers of Ant & Dec's Saturday Night Takeaway board game have apologised after it was found to have several errors. The game features cards with a series of quiz questions, but some of the answers given are incorrect. One answer claims the moon is 225 miles away from the earth - instead of about 238,900 miles. Manufacturers Paul Lamond Games said they ""unreservedly apologise"" and added replacement cards would be issued. It is understood at least six of the 50 answers in one round of the game - which costs Â£19.99 - are incorrect. One answer placed Stonehenge in Somerset instead of Wiltshire and a maths question suggested two cubed was bigger than three squared. It also said Albert Einstein died in 1949 instead of 1955 and gave the number of Coronation Street episodes to date as 8,000, when the actual figure is more than 9,000. One customer who bought the game toldThe Sun,external: ""I couldn't believe it, the answers are so ridiculous... [but] the kids won't accept the game could possibly be wrong."" A representative for Paul Lamond Games told the BBC: ""We have been made aware of some mistakes with the answers to the questions within the first production run of this game."" ""These have now been corrected and we would like to unreservedly apologise for these errors. ""Any affected customer can email us stating their name and full address and we will send out a replacement set of corrected cards free of charge.""

Tesco shrugs off pyjama complaint,"Tesco has said shoppers wearing nightclothes in its stores is ""not a big issue"", after one customer asked it to refuse to serve such people. A customer at the Salford store posted his request on Tesco's Facebook page alongside a picture of two women wearing pyjamas and dressing gowns. Chris Cooke said he had seen shoppers dressed similarly on ""a regular basis"". Tesco said it did not have a dress code and staff used ""common sense"" in talking to customers about the issue. Mr Cook's post, which he has since taken down, said: ""Dear Tesco, please can you put a rule in place that people like this will not be served in your stores."" He added that it was ""disgusting"" and went on: ""Who doesn't have time to get changed into clothes to go shopping?"" Tesco's customer services team responded with a post saying that ""many of our customers have told us that they feel uncomfortable when they see other shoppers wearing unsuitable clothing in our stores and we do try to find a balance that everyone is happy with"". However, a Tesco spokesperson told the BBC: ""In general, it's not a big issue "" The Facebook complaint had ""generated a lot of discussion ""and a lot of people were commenting on that one post, he added. He said there was no ban on nightwear in its stores and nothing had changed as a result of the Facebook complaint. ""We do not have a formal dress code in our stores and colleagues use their common sense and discretion when speaking to customers about this issue."" In 2010, a Tesco store in Cardiff asked customers not to shop in their pyjamas or barefoot. Notices were put up in the chain's supermarket in St Mellons saying: ""Footwear must be worn at all times and no nightwear is permitted."" Irish welfare office bans pyjamas The wrong trousers?

Taiwan funeral features 50 pole dancers,"The convoy of 50 jeeps with pole dancers brought traffic in Chiayi city to a standstill A Taiwanese funeral featuring 50 pole dancers has become the talk of the Chinese internet this week. Videos of the funeral procession, which took place on Tuesday, have been circulating online showing skimpily-clad women gyrating on top of jeeps in the southern city of Chiayi. The funeral was for local politician Tung Hsiang, who died last month. His family said they wanted to honour Mr Tung, who loved ""having a lively fun time"", local media reported. The procession, featuring the convoy of colourful jeeps blasting loud music, brought traffic to a standstill in the city centre. It also had a drumming troupe, a marching band, performers dressed as deities and giant puppets. The dancers were part of huge funeral procession for local councillor Tung Hsiang Mr Tung, a local councillor, was a well-known figure in the city and was active in politics for decades. He died from an unspecified illness at the age of 76 in December. ""He told us he wanted this through a dream two days before the funeral,"" his brother Tung Mao-hsiung told Taiwanese broadcaster CTS. Since Tuesday,videos of the procession,externalhave been circulating on Chinese media and social network Weibo, generating much interest. ""Now this is what I call a funeral!"" said one user, while another wrote: ""Looks like when it comes to funeral matters, Taiwan still comes first."" Others praised Mr Tung and his family for providing an entertaining afternoon for the city's residents. ""This is what it means to be the 'people's councillor'!"" said one netizen. Another person joked: ""The city's residents are asking: please die one more time!"" But hiring dancers and even strippers for funerals is not that unusual in parts of Taiwanese society, in which some practise a folk religion that believes in ""entertaining"" spirits. One expert wrote that,externalthe practice combined old customs of using professional female wailers at funerals and holding processions for religious holidays with a desire to celebrate the deceased with a big, bustling public event.

The year ahead in sports news,"After an unforgettable and relentless year for sports news, what does 2017 hold in store? Plenty, as sports editor Dan Roan explains: There's no football World Cup, and it may not be an Olympic year, but expect 2017 to revive fond memories of the London Games, with a host of major sports events on the horizon. Buoyed by Britain's remarkable success in Rio last year, track and field will take centre stage, first at the World ParaAthletics Championships, and then the IAAF World Championships, both held at London's former Olympic Stadium. It is the first time the two events have been held in the same city, and the same summer. It promises to be afitting send-off for triple Olympic champion Usain Bolt,racing competitively for the final time before he retires, and also for double Olympic champion Mo Farah, who says he will focus on the marathon after the worlds. This video can not be played Mo Farah: Future on the road after Rio 2016 With Jessica Ennis-Hill already having retired however, it will be interesting to see whether a new generation of British talent - led by Scotland'sLaura Muir- can make their mark, (and whether Russia will be allowed to compete at all after recent claims of state-sponsored doping). With the world's best team lying in wait, the British and Irish Lions trip to New Zealand is arguably the biggest and most anticipated rugby tour ever, and certain to add even more spice to this year'sSix Nations. With England unbeaten under Eddie Jones and Ireland having recently won against the All Blacks for the first time, coach Warren Gatland can select a strong squad to seriously challenge the hosts. But it will be far from easy. The ultimate rugby challenge awaits against a team that continues to come as close as any in sport to perfection. If there is one place above all others to be covering sport this year, it is Auckland on 24 June for the first Test of what should be a titanic series. 2017 monthly highlights January:Australian Open (tennis) July:Wimbledon (tennis) February:Six Nations (rugby union) August:IAAF World Championships (athletics) March:Australian Grand Prix (Formula 1) September:England v West Indies, Test, T20 and ODI (cricket) April:Masters (golf) October:Rugby League World Cup May:FA Cup final (football) November:England v Australia, Ashes (cricket) June:Champions League final (football) December:King George VI Chase (horse racing) Having come third in the 2015 World Cup, England's women footballers will have high hopes inthe biggest Euros staged to date,,externalwith 16 participants vying for glory in the Netherlands. A mouth-watering opening tie against Scotland in Utrecht on 19 July should ensure significant interest in a competition that is expected to give another major boost to the women's game. This summer will also see England host thewomen's cricket World Cup,,externaland Ireland stage the rugby union World Cup, with England confident of retaining the title they won three years ago. The last time England turned up in Australia for the Ashes, they were humiliated, with batsman Jonathan Trott leaving a shambolic tour early,Graeme Swannretiring mid-series, andKevin Pietersenplaying his last Test before being banished. This time, with the likes of Joe Root and Ben Stokes now firmly established among the world's finest cricketers, they should fare significantly better that the 5-0 whitewash they endured in 2013-14. By the time the series starts in November, Australia will have also hosted rugby league's World Cup, with England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland all involved. Elsewhere, in football it will be fascinating to see who prevails in the Premier League, with the 'big six' clubs having restored the natural order after the Leicester City 'miracle' last season. And there is the climax to qualification for the 2018 World Cup to look forward to as well. England will seek to regain the Women's World Cup title they last won in 2009, this time with Heather Knight captaining the squad Theincredible spending potentialof China's clubs will no doubt continue the power shift in football's transfer market, along with more Chinese investment in English clubs. It is also a big year for sailing, with Sir Ben Ainslie aiming to bring the America's Cup to Britain for the first time. Lewis Hamilton is favourite to claim a fourth world title as F1 prepares for life without last year's winner Nico Rosberg, and withLiberty Mediahoping to complete their multi-billion dollar takeover of the motorsport series, expect change away from the the track too, with much interest in the next move of F1's 86-year-old commercial supremo Bernie Ecclestone. In tennis, world number one Andy Murray will attempt to win the Australian Open for the first time, and cycling's Chris Froome will target a fourth Tour de France victory, while Carl Frampton v Leo Santa Cruz and Anthony Joshua v Wladimir Klitschko are the highlights ofa bumper year in boxing. And perhaps we will finally discover ifthe prospect of a mega-fightbetween UFC superstar Conor McGregor and retired unbeaten boxer Floyd Mayweather is anything more than just talk. Doping was the longest-running and biggest single issue in sports news last year, with claims ofRussian state-sponsored cheatinglaid bare in two damning reports by Professor Richard McLaren, the build-up to the Rio Games overshadowed by the scandal, and the suspension of tennis starMaria Sharapova. In 2017, sports' leaders will be under mounting pressure to finally decide how to regain trust in the world's anti-doping regime. When the two International Olympic Committee (IOC) commissions have concluded their work, the organisation must punish Russia. With more positive results from the re-testing of Russian samples from London 2012 and Sochi 2014 expected over the coming weeks, and with the country already having been stripped of thebobsleigh and skeleton World Championshipsin March, should it also be banned from the winter Games next year? Maria Sharapova was Russia's highest-profile athlete to be exposed in the 2016 doping scandal Russia has now admitted some doping took place, but continues to contest any government involvement, and there are serious doubts that it can persuade athletics' governing body, the International Association of Athletics Federations (IAAF), to lift its suspension of the country's track and field athletes in time for the World Championships. The long-anticipated reform of the World Anti-Doping Agency (Wada) must also be decided. Will it be granted the autonomy, additional resources, and sanctioning power that many in the anti-doping community are demanding? These are the difficult questions international sport must wrestle with over the coming months as it tries to recover from the worst doping scandal in history. There could be more bad news on the way however, with reports that the names of athletes who had bags of blood confiscated as part ofOperation Puertoin Spain may be revealed. And could the Fancy Bears hackers cause more mayhem with further revelations? For the Football Association, Clive Sheldon QC has become a very important man. The barrister is heading up the governing body'sreview,externalinto allegations of child sexual abuse, and the FA is under mounting pressure to make the findings public, and then to act on them decisively and appropriately. With hundreds of victims coming forward, more than155 suspects identified,and 148 clubs involved - so far - the scale of the scandal is breathtaking. With the possibility of more suspensions of officials, along with the prospect of further criminal charges, and compensation claims, this story will extend well beyond 2017 as British football seeks answers to the worst crisis in its history. Current footballers may have been slow to publicly back the Offside Trust - set up to support the victims of abuse - but the issue of child protection in sport is here to stay. After the most turbulent year in its history, cycling is braced for the conclusion of two separate investigations. UK Sport will shortly announce the findings of an independent review into whether there was a culture of bullying and sexism at governing body British Cycling after a series ofallegationsfrom former riders and employees. Meanwhile, after being questioned by MPs over the circumstances surrounding a medical package delivered to his former rider Sir Bradley Wiggins, the future of one of the country's leading sports coaches - Team Sky supremo Sir Dave Brailsford - will hinge on the outcome of a UK Anti-Doping investigation intoallegations of wrongdoingin the sport. Wiggins recently announced his retirement. But with the parliamentary committee considering calling more witnesses, do not expect the controversy over his use of therapeutic use exemptions (TUEs) before major races to go away. Wiggins' TUEs were approved by British authorities and cycling's world governing body the UCI. The pressure is still on the country's most decorated Olympian - and its most successful sport. The British President of the UCI, Brian Cookson, will seek re-election, while British Cycling must appoint a new chief executive. The countdown to what has the potential to be the most controversial World Cup to date has begun. Organisers of Russia 2018 have already had to defend themselves against accusations of corruption in the bidding process, racist behaviour, and, since those chaotic scenes at last year'sEuros in France,a new generation of hooligans. The recent state-sponsored doping scandal has only intensified calls for Russia to be stripped of football's showpiece event. Lots will be at stake this summer when the nation hosts the Confederations Cup - the traditional dress-rehearsal for the World Cup. For three cities, the clock is ticking down to Wednesday, 13 September. That is when, in Lima, the International Olympic Committee (IOC) will gather amid the usual fanfare, and vote to decide the hosts of the 33rd Olympiad in 2024. Before then, expect eight months of presentations, inspection visits and relentless lobbying. The race is seen as a straight fight between what appear to be two 'safe' candidate cities; Los Angeles and Paris, both bidding to stage the Games for a third time. But the IOC is under serious pressure over the budget-busting costs and questionable legacy benefits of their showpiece event. Could politics in the US and France have an impact on their 2024 Olympics bids? So how better to prove that President Thomas Bach's'Agenda 2020' reforms,external- designed to bring about cheaper, more sustainable Games - are actually working, than to award them to a more modest bid, from a smaller city, like dark horses Budapest? Paris remains the favourite, but with US network NBC paying the IOC billions in broadcast rights, and with the next three Olympics all heading to Asian time zones (especially unfavourable to American TV audiences), LA's supporters are growing increasingly confident that it is their turn. Will a Donald Trump administration harm the US city's chances? Could the possible election of far-right leader Marine Le Pen in France's presidential election in April have a similar impact on Paris? All will be revealed in Peru. The integrity of sport will continue to be a priority for politicians in 2017, with the government committed to a review of the UK Anti-Doping Agency. Also expect significant interest in whether the government's latest sports strategy - intended to tackle inactivity - especially among the poor and children - is making any progress. By April, all sports that want to receive public funding must also show they are taking steps to comply with a new governance code, designed to improve decision-making, transparency and diversity on boards. Sports that controversially lost out in UK Sport's recent divvy-up of National Lottery elite performance funding will have their appeals heard. And with football's abuse scandal emphasising the importance of child protection, Baroness Grey-Thompson's review into sports' duty of care towards athletes will also take on extra significance. With the election of a new president, 2016 was a year of relative calm for Fifa as football's world governing body tried to move on from the scandal that shook it to the core. But later this year, the long-awaited trial of defendants in the wide-ranging corruption case, led by the FBI, begins in New York. There will be other issues of course; from the threat of terrorism, to safe-standing in football, concussion in rugby, mechanical doping in cycling, tax evasion and the rise of e-sports.

Laptop has not one but three screens,"Razer claims its three-screened concept laptop is a world first Gaming PC maker Razer has unveiled a concept laptop with three 4K screens at the CES tech show in Las Vegas. The firm claimsProject Valerie,externalis the world's first portable laptop of its kind. Two additional screens slide out from the central display via an automatic mechanism. One analyst praised the design, noting that gamers were increasingly splashing out on high-end laptops. All three screens are 17in (43cm) in size. When folded up and closed, the laptop is 1.5in thick. Razer said this was comparable to many standard gaming laptops, which tend to be chunkier than home and office devices. ""We thought, 'This is crazy, can we do this?',"" a company spokesman told the BBC. ""The answer was: 'Yeah, we are crazy enough, we can do it'."" Project Valerie is still a prototype and Razer has not yet published a possible release date or price. Project Valerie has special hinges that automatically deploy its two additional screens Gamers commonly used more than one monitor these days, said gaming analyst Jonathan Wagstaff at Context. ""Although it is unusual, it doesn't surprise me,"" he told the BBC. ""It is something people will buy - I think it will sell."" He added that increasing numbers of gamers - particularly those who travel to e-sports tournaments - are in the market for portable computers with high specs. But Mr Wagstaff added that industry data he had reviewed suggested widening interest in such machines from architectural and graphic design firms, as well. ""That is interesting, that is traditionally the territory of Apple's products,"" he said. Project Valerie was just one of several gaming laptops shown off at CES. Computer maker Acer unveiled a large, 21in model called thePredator 21X,external, which costs $8,999 (Â£7,250).

Who is Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier?,"This video can not be played Watch Nicholas Watt's in-depth profile of the EU's chief Brexit negotiator Just over half a century ago Britain's place as an estranged member of the European family was cemented by a Frenchman when President Charles De Gaulle vetoed the UK's attempts to join the EEC. Britain eventually joined the club. Now, as it leaves the EU, a political descendant of the wartime Free French leader will play the decisive role in deciding the nature of the UK's future relationship with the EU. Michel Barnier, the former French foreign minister who is the EU's chief negotiator on Brexit, has spent the last few months on a Grand Tour of Europe to agree a common front once the formal talks start in the spring. So just who is Michel Barnier? Is he a European federalist out to punish Britain or is he more of a deal maker who will work hard to avoid a so-called train crash Brexit in which the UK falls out of the EU in a disorderly fashion? The Barnier story begins in his backyard in the French Alps where he organised the 1992 Winter Olympic Games - one of his proudest achievements. To the Paris elite the Olympics marked Barnier out as something of provincial figure who is guilty of a grave offence for a senior French public official; he failed to attend the elite Ecole nationale d'administration. Baroness Bowles, the former Liberal Democrat MEP who knows Barnier from her time as chair of the European Parliament's Economic and Monetary Affairs committee, says he was known as the ""ski instructor"". Michel Barnier and his wife Isabelle Lord Patten of Barnes, the former Tory chairman, who knew Barnier from his time as France's junior European commissioner, did not see him as a top flight politician. ""He's not a joke. He's not a second rater - he'd be perfectly plausible, given our national differences, in a British cabinet in a sort of job like minister of transport,"" he said. ""I'm not being too condescending but I don't think he'd be home secretary or foreign secretary."" As someone who was shunned by the gilded elite of Paris, Barnier potentially has common ground with his UK counterpart, David Davis, whose friends feel he was patronised by former PM David Cameron's circle. But friends of Barnier suggest they were hardly soulmates when they both served as Europe minister because Davis opposed the EU's social chapter. As Europe minister, Barnier showed that he hailed from the Gaullist tradition in France which is suspicious of the Anglo-Saxon world view. But he is no diehard Gaullist and bears no ill will to Britain, according to an old ally. Michel Dantin, who is now an MEP, told Newsnight: ""Michel Barnier is a Gaullist, a social Gaullist. His idea of Europe is a Europe of nations and not a federation. ""I think that in the forthcoming negotiations he will respect the British nation because he is aware of history and his approach is to respect others."" Barnier's Brussels breakthrough came in 2010 when he landed one of the biggest jobs in the European Commission - as internal market commissioner. This gave him oversight of the City of London, prompting howls of outrage that a Frenchman would undermine a key part of the UK economy. Mr Barnier with Eurogroup President Jeroen Dijsselbloem Lord King of Lothbury, the former governor of the Bank of England, raised his voice in a meeting with Barnier in his office in 2011 after he put forward proposals to regulate banks. King told Barnier that his ideas on the amount of equity finance banks should issue and the amount of liquidity the banks should hold ran were inconsistent with the proposals of the Basel committee. Bank sources said that King did not believe Barnier was hostile to the City; he was simply wedded to the idea of pan-European regulation. Mark Hoban, City minister at the time, saw a more pragmatic figure who underwent a learning curve. ""Certainly I found him, at the beginnings of my dealings with him in the aftermath of the crisis, very keen to talk about the failure of Anglo Saxon capitalism because he knew that played well in continental Europe,"" he said. ""Two years later, as I was leaving the Treasury, [I found him] more attuned to jobs and growth."" Barnier's track record in Brussels made him the natural choice as the chief Brexit negotiator. Nigel Farage, the former UKIP leader, believes Barnier will be guided entirely by maintaining the sanctity of the European project. ""Crucially he's of the project. He's a true believer in the religion of building a united states of Europe and so he's the man they're going to trust."" Jonathan Faull, who has just retired after 38 years of service in the European Commission where he worked with Barnier, says he will not set out to punish Britain. But he will have red lines. ""Mr Barnier will want to be constructive I have no doubt,"" said Faull. ""He will want to secure the best possible deal for the 27 states of the EU, a deal which maintains their integrity and their fundamental principles governing their internal market."" In private, Davis believes there are two Michel Barniers. One is the hardliner who vented frustration over Britain's approach at an informal meeting last year. But the Brexit secretary is expecting to meet a flexible deal maker once the formal negotiations are under way this spring. Dantin, one of Barnier's oldest political allies, warns Davis to work hard on building a relationship with him. ""If we want the negotiations to succeed it is necessary to have confidence between the two main negotiators,"" he said. ""If the negotiations go wrong the EU will not have much to lose but the UK will have much to lose. That is because the UK is effectively the supplicant."" The future of Britain's scratchy relationship with the EU will, in the initial negotiations, rest in the hands of two political outsiders. Perhaps they will find common ground over their shared love of outdoors sport, though the silver haired and suave Frenchman would probably never be seen dead hiking across mountains in the style of his British counterpart.

Mixed response to #Awkward police appeal,"A police force's open letter to a suspected burglar - which included emojis and hashtags - has met with a mixed response online. Kingston Policetweeted,externalthe note addressed to Tracey Dyke, who is suspected of multiple burglaries, accusing her of ""blanking"" them. Some users applauded the ""novel"" social media appeal, while others accused the Met of ""public shaming"". Police said Ms Dyke was a suspect in crimes involving ""vulnerable victims"". Officers posted the appeal, featuring a photograph of Ms Dyke, and the caption: ""Please stop ignoring us Tracey"". In a two-page letter appealing for her to contact detectives, they wrote: ""We have come round to see you a number of times recently but it looks like you'd rather not speak to us, which is very disappointing. ""We have a slight suspicion that you might be blanking us #Awkward. You don't text, you don't call back and haven't accepted our friend request."" They added: ""We won't stand for this and want to have a discussion with you at our custody suite."" Met Police borough commander Nick Downing congratulated Kingston Police on its ""very innovative"" appeal. ""Sure the brilliant communities of #Kingston will help track this suspect down,"" he wrote. But others were less impressed with the tone of the letter, and accused the force of being ""unprofessional"" by using hashtags and emoji.

Meet Ray BLK,"This video can not be played BBC Sound Of 2017 winner: Ray BLK Street-smart soul singer Ray BLK has come top of the BBC's Sound of 2017 list. Hailing from south London, she's been making music since she was nine, filling her school notebooks with rap verses after watching Missy Elliot and Ludacris on MTV Base. Aged 13, she formed a group with her school friendMNEK, who has gone on to work with Beyonce, Little Mix and Madonna. Called New Found Content, ""which is a terrible name"", their songs never saw the light of day - but the experience fuelled her passion for performing. Herdebut EP,externalwas released in 2015, as she studied for a degree in English Literature. It told the tale of a girl who turns against men after having her heart broken, inspired by Miss Havisham's story in Charles Dickens' Great Expectations. Although she doesn't rap any more, she's retained the genre's forthright attitude - combining smart, literate lyrics with gorgeous R&B melodies. Songs like5050,externalandMy Hood,externalhave seen her branded ""the UK's answer to Lauryn Hill"" - but she's determined to forge her own identity, rooted in her London upbringing. The singer, whose real name is Rita Ekwere, spoke to the BBC about her upbringing, hooking up with Stormzy, and how a robbery inspired her breakthrough song. 5.Nadia Rose 4.Jorja Smith 3.Raye 2.Rag 'N' Bone Man 1.Ray BLK Congratulations on winning the Sound Of 2017! How does it feel? Mega cool! I keep using the word surreal, because it is. Everything's surreal. I'm living the dream. You've been called ""the Lauryn Hill of the UK"". Are you going to release one album then disappear? Haha! I love music too much to do that. Where does the name Ray BLK come from? Ray is taken from my last name, and BLK stands for Building, Living, Knowing. Building: For your future and working hard. Living: Because I believe you have to live your life to the fullest. And knowing: Because I think education is really important. We should keep trying to learn for the whole of our lifetime. This video can not be played Ray BLK performs My Hood in her local caff Tell me about growing up in Catford. Well, I was born in Nigeria and I came to London when I was about four. Catford is a weird place, to be honest. Friends that come and visit say I live in a ghost town. But there's a sense of community and it's given me thick skin, as well. Why did you need thick skin? Growing up here, especially in school, there's a lot of bullying - but there's also a culture of knowing how to defend yourself. Everyone here has to be strong. Were you picked on? I got away with not being picked on because I was always the one that gave it back! My mum raised me to fight my corner. You've got to dust yourself off and fight. What was the first song you learned the words to? The first video I remember seeing was Michael Jackson'sDon't Stop 'Til You Get Enough,external. I remember copying the dance moves and wanting to be as cool as he was. That's what started it off for me. When did you discover your singing voice? Do you know what's funny? I think I carried on singing because my sister told me I was really bad! So just to prove that I wasn't, I kept on at it. I would listen to Whitney Houston and Mariah Carey every day and try to copy their riffs. So I kind of feel like I'm having a ""ha ha"" moment! The singer worked with grime stars Stormzy, Wretch 32 and SG Lewis on her latest EP Is it true you made your early songs by stealing beats from YouTube? I really took advantage of the internet, and I think that's what got me hereâ¦ Being able to rip beats and record with them, then put it on Soundcloud for people to listen and share it. It feels like the recent explosion in Grime and British R&B has facilitated by the internet. People are making and distributing their music directly to fans. Right. People who wouldn't otherwise have had a chance are getting heard, and making a name for themselves. I think it's really important. You started releasing music when you were at university, right? Yeah, when I first made my mixtape I was in my last year of uni, avoiding my dissertation. What was the dissertation? I wrote it on post-colonial Nigerian literature - focused on the novels of Chinua Achebe and Chimamanda Adichie. Presumably, your parents were hoping that would lead to a ""proper job""? I've been lucky, in that my family have been so supportive. My mum's my biggest champion. If I told her today I want to be Prime Minister, she'd be like, ""Yes, of course. You're going to win the election!"" What would your main policy be? Oh, that's a really difficult question. More bank holidays?! Like several artists on the Sound of 2017 list, Ray has deliberately decided not to sign with a major record label That first EP, the Havisham EP, was themed around a Charles Dickens novel. How come? We were studying Great Expectations as part of the curriculum, and I was so inspired by the story. I felt like Miss Havisham was like a lot of women around me, who got their heart broken and turned cold and began to hate men. Are you the heartbreaker or the one that gets heartbroken? Both, probably! But what I learned the most was not to be sour. Getting heartbroken needs to happen because, first of all, you pick a better person next time and, secondly, it makes you stronger. Your breakthrough song, My Hood, features a verse from Stormzy. How did you hook up with him? I met him a couple of years ago at a local talent show, and we said we'd do something together in the future. Then he liked the song and wanted to be part of it. It was all seamless and organic. I want to have been at that talent show... Do you know, it's a good show. They find some really good people. Where is it? It was in Croydon. It's called Unsigned Stars and Stormzy won, I think, in 2012. So they see talent years before the world sees it. The thing with these local talent shows is they're really honest. If people are rubbish, they laugh. They really give it to you. Ray worked as a copywriter for an advertising agency to fund her music career My Hood was written about Catford - but it's quite bittersweet. Why is that? I was robbed around the time I wrote it and I honestly just wanted to leave. I was like, ""I'm getting robbed. My neighbours sell drugs out of their house. It's not where I need to be."" That must have been really unsettling. I was extremely upset because my laptop got stolen and it had all my old songs that I'd been writing for years and years. It hurt so much. Was there a back-up? They've gone, they've gone! I mean, some of them are still in my head but they're gone. The ones that stick in your head are the ones worth keeping... And there'll be new ones anyway, so it's not too much of a loss. The video for Chill Out features persecuted members of Jamaica's LGBT community For the video toChill Out,external, you went out to Jamaica and filmed with transgender women who've been forced out of their homes, and live in Kingston's storm drains. What was that experience like? Meeting the Gully Queens was such an incredible experience. It put a lot into perspective because every day of their lives is a struggle and a battle to stay alive - yet they were so happy, so full of life. It made me feel like I need to be a lot more appreciative of how good my life is. Living in the West, you don't actually realise how the things we see as normal are considered abnormal in other parts of the world. Now we're trying to raise money to get them into safe housing. The original song isn't about that struggle, but the visuals and the music really complement each other. Chill Out, for me, was about female empowerment and not letting society tell you how to act. I felt like the video completed that, really, because it was about empowering these females to be who they want to be as well. Female empowerment hasn't been a big topic for UK artists up to now. Why do you think that is? Everyone has their own message. I make music for myself and people like me, so a lot of my songs tend to be about being a woman and strength and confidence. Is it something that needs to be discussed more? Absolutely. I don't feel as though I hear much about female empowerment from female artists. On the flipside, one of your forthcoming songs has a lyric about ""doing it in an Uber"". I wonder what that would do to your star rating? Haha! I need it to go up, to be honest. An Uber driver told me my score wasn't very good, and I don't know why. Maybe I take too long to find the car? So finally, now that you're officially the Sound of 2017, what's your ambition for the year ahead? I just want to become a better artist. I've used this year to find my feet, and now I want to amplify that and give people more music, better music.

Career tips,"This video can not be played Jess Ratty talks about how she built her LinkedIn profile ""I've gone from being a 16-year-old waitress to being a business owner and senior executive, and I couldn't have done that without my online network."" Jess Ratty is a woman with a mission. She wants us all to get better at promoting ourselves professionally online - and creating our own career opportunities along the way. Given that changing jobs can be one of the hardest things we do, many of us might welcome anything that makes switching jobs easier. According to a survey byHired,,externaleight in 10 of us say we find changing jobs stressful  - and more stressful than moving house, planning a wedding or even having root canal work. When it comes to job-hunting, Jess says the key is not to let your stress stop you from taking action: ""Don't fret about things so much, or worry about how you might come across."" It's something she has put into practice in her own career. Now a senior executive at Crowdfunder, the UK's biggest crowd-funding platform which raises funds from small investors, Jess says she's come a long way since dropping out of school. She started work at the Eden Project in Cornwall as a waitress, and says it was her colleagues who helped her realise she ""could maybe start achieving great things myself."" So she set about creating an online professional profile as a shop window for herself - and says having an active online presence has been crucial for her career. Being creative with your online profile helps you stand out from the crowd, says Jess ""Crowdfunder found me through LinkedIn and went on to offer me a job."" Crowdfunder's Dawn Bebe, who recruited Jess, says what's important for her when recruiting someone ""is getting a sense of what they are like and what they are passionate about"". Jess's experience is increasingly common, says Darain Faraz of LinkedIn. ""A lot of the time, most people aren't looking for work, they are what we call passive candidates. But LinkedIn can help jobs look for you."" Yet this only works if you have a complete profile, and sadly us Brits are not very good at self-promotion. We're more likely to share food pictures on our social media channels than our work successes or announcements of a new job. Even if you're not looking for a job ""promoting yourself professionally"" will put you on firms' radars, says LinkedIn's Darain Faraz Get a decent profile picture, says Darain, you'll be 14 times more likely to be viewed Work on your professional image, recruiters will check you out online Give examples of your work and achievements Make time for a little professional networking every day Follow organisations you'd like to work for and share their updates ""People do make judgements based on our online profiles,"" says Darain. And be assured, recruiters will also check your Twitter activity and Facebook profile as well: ""Make sure that how you position yourself online is how you want to be seen,"" he adds. ""You don't want your Saturday night becoming your Monday morning."" Even if you're not looking for work it makes sense to keep you online profile updated, say recruiters The mistake many of us make is to only use professional networking sites when we're looking for a new role, says Darain. But what recruiters want to see is a track record, so that they can judge whether or not we are right for a job. ""One of the first things we do is check [online] for potential candidates in the right geographical area who have the skills and interests that we think would work for us,"" says Crowdfunder's Dawn Bebe. The jobs recruitment sector has changed markedly in the past few years, with a vast amount of job searching and head-hunting now done online with sites such as Monster, Reed, Viadeo and Xing. LinkedIn has about 400 million members worldwide (in the UK it has 20 million members - some 60% of Britain's working population and students) and last year Microsoft paid over $26bn (Â£18bn) for LinkedIn. Now Facebook, with more than a billion monthly active users, has launched Workplace; it's a platform designed to help workers talk to each other, in-house. Could Facebook come to challenge LinkedIn? While it is currently for use within firms, given Facebook's size it has the potential to be a serious rival to LinkedIn. Jess has her own tip for young professionals. ""You need to be creative and inventive with your online profile if you want to stand out,"" she says. ""You need to be consistent if you are using it to develop your career."" If you are thinking about potential downsides "" you'll probably avoid them anyway,"" says Jess Jess says she always wanted to make her career in her home county - Cornwall. Besides working for Crowdfunder, she and her partner have now set up the Cornwall Camper Company, hiring out restored VW campervans to holidaymakers. She points out that thanks to online networking sites, ""you can make a big impact wherever you are"". But she also has this important piece of advice.   Merely being online is no substitute for professional knowledge and commitment, she cautions: ""You've got to know your stuff.""

Shadow Puppets LP wins album art prize,"Everything You've Come to Expect came top of the poll while Blackstar (right) came second A record cover featuring a 1969 image of Tina Turner has beaten David Bowie's final release Blackstar to a prize for the year's best album artwork. The Last Shadow Puppets' Everything You've Come to Expect was selected from50 entrants,externalin the annual awards. Mark Pritchard's photo landscapes for his Under the Sun record came third, according to a public vote. Now in its 11th year, the prize is organised by Art Vinyl, a company that promotes record covers as art. The announcementfollows newsthat vinyl sales topped three million last year - the highest UK total in 25 years. The Last Shadow Puppets was formed by Miles Kane (left) of The Rascals and Arctic Monkeys' Alex Turner Illustrator Matthew Cooper used a photo of Turner taken by Vogue's Jack Robinson to decorate the cover for the Last Shadow Puppets' second album. ""The idea was to move the artwork on from the '60s feel of the first Last Shadow Puppets album artwork, so here is Tina on the very cusp of the 1970s,"" he explained. The original black-and-white image was given a gold tint ""to create an identifiable colour scheme and a warmer, more contemporary feel."" Blackstar was released shortly before Bowie's death in January last year at the age of 69. David Gilmour's Rattle That Lock albumwon last year's prize.

Gordon Corera: What fate awaits Guantanamo?,"This video can not be played What is it like inside Guantanamo Bay? These are uncertain times at Guantanamo Bay. Not only for the detainees but also those who guard them. After eight years in which President Obama has tried - and failed - to close the detention facility, what will President Trump mean for its future? The first detainees arrived at Camp X-Ray 15 years ago in the early months of what was then called the ""War on Terror"". I first visited a few weeks later and watched the men in orange jumpsuits in steel cages in the hot Cuban sun. Guantanamo had been chosen partly because it was not US soil and so avoided coming under regular US law. The camp then had a thrown together feel - the Bush administration was improvising and no-one was sure how long it would last. The orange jumpsuits worn by detainees became notorious The next time I visited - two years later - Camp X-Ray had been replaced by the more permanent structure of Camp Delta. Guantanamo was here to stay. Its numbers grew - around 700 at its peak. But on his second day in office eight years agoPresident Obama promised to close the facility,externaland the pace of transfers increased. On my visit a few weeks ago, I found much of the Camp eerily empty, a lone iguana roaming around the barbed wire. But closing Guantanamo was a promise President Obama could not keep, partly because Congress blocked the transfer of any detainees to the US. Fewer than 60 men are now left. There are 20 currently cleared for release and the Obama administration is trying to transfer some of these out before its term ends. But on 3 January,President-elect Trump made his views clear in a tweet. ""There should be no further releases,"" he wrote. ""These are extremely dangerous people and should not be allowed back on to the battlefield."" Most of the remaining detainees are held now in Camp Six. Inside a cell in Camp Six at Guantanamo Bay The uncertainty hanging over the base was clear as we toured the detention block. We were able to watch and film detainees in the communal areas of their cell block through one-way glass, an unsettling procedure. The detainees are not supposed to know we are there but clearly they realised as one put up a hand-painted sign showing a question mark with a padlock underneath. They followed the election result like everyone else and Col Steve Gabavics, Commander of the Joint Detention Force, told me: ""They were all watching TV - their behaviour was pretty much the same as any other night. ""We didn't notice any significant negative response. No-one came to us angry, no-one protested. They were simply interested to see what was going to happen."" Colonel Steve Gabavics said they noticed no reaction to Donald Trump's election victory One difference from my early visits is just how much more controlled - even mundane - the interaction between detainees and guards is now compared to the early days. The attacks of 2001 were still raw and there was a tension and sense of underlying aggression on both sides. Now, the atmosphere is much more controlled. Detainees tap on a window to summon a guard when they have a message to pass and the guard proceeds through a door into a cage-like structure inside the cell-block where they can communicate with a detainee. During our visit in December, officials say that the detainees were ""compliant"". But what does the arrival of President Trump mean? ""You know the detainees have questions - are the transfers going to stop when the new president takes office on 20 January? We don't know, they don't know. Their lawyers may speculate, but no-one knows,"" says Rear Adm Peter Clarke, commander of Joint Task Force Guantanamo. He did say - before Donald Trump's latest tweet - that ""some of them may act up"" if they realise they are not going to be transferred. Somewhere else on the base, which sprawls across an otherwise isolated tip of Cuba, is Camp Seven. Its precise location is secret - leading to much speculation from visiting reporters. This is where so-called high value detainees are being held - men like Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, the alleged mastermind of the 11 September attacks who is going through the long slow process of a military commission - a form of trial. Khalid Sheikh Mohammed was captured in Pakistan in March 2003 and sent to the US detention centre in Cuba in 2006 Might it be not only that transfers out are stopped, but that current detainees find they have some company? ""We are going to load it up with bad dudes,"" Mr Trump said in the campaign trail in February last year. Camp Five was built to hold detainees but now sits empty. What if President Trump decides he wants to not just stop people leaving but send in new detainees? The maximum capacity of Camp Six is around 175 detainees. Camp Five could hold 80 - it has been part-converted to a new medical facility. That means potentially Guantanamo could accommodate more than 100 extra detainees pretty much immediately. More than that would require construction work. Officials say it is a ""reasonable assumption"" that they would want to segregate new detainees who would be more likely to be members of so-called Islamic State rather than al-Qaeda. ""We are prepared to receive some if that was required in the short term,"" Col Gabavics told us. The Obama administration's push to close Guantanamo also meant there was a reluctance to capture more detainees in counter-terrorism operations around the world, some former officials say. They believe that a policy of ""take no prisoners"" created an incentive to kill rather than capture, with the administration increasing the pace and the geographical spread of drone strikes which - on occasion - might mean useful intelligence gleaned from interrogation or captured material might be lost. Rear Adm Peter Clarke said he is confident he will not be asked to torture detainees Mr Trump has also said that he would consider returning to the practice of waterboarding detainees. Could that take place at Guantanamo? Rear Adm Clarke said he was ""confident"" that there will be no torture at Guantanamo. ""Whatever orders we receive, by the time they come to me from US Southern Command, I am confident those orders will be legal orders that I will be ready to carry out,"" he said. In the 15 years since Guantanamo was opened, the contours of America's war on terror have changed. New enemies have emerged and the question of what to do with those America is fighting - where to put them, how to treat them and even whether to kill or capture them - will now be for a new president to decide.

Car-makers choose virtual assistants,"Hyundai has teamed up with Google to allow users of Google Home to lock their cars remotely, among other features Four leading car brands have announced deals with three tech giants to add virtual assistants to new cars. Microsoft's Cortana netted two of the deals, the others went to Amazon's Alexa and Google's Assistant. The announcements were made at the CES tech show in Las Vegas. One analyst said there would be a ""battle of the giants"" over the adoption of virtual assistants in 2017, since they can be built in to a variety of appliances. Nissan and BMW have opted to work with Microsoft to bring Cortana to selected vehicles in the near future. Ford, however, has struck a deal with Amazon meaning its assistant, Alexa, will feature in some of its cars. And Hyundai andDaimler,externalhave said they will make their cars partly voice-operable with Google Assistant. Ford has warned customers not to be distracted while driving and talking to Alexa Apple's Siri assistant is alreadyavailable in certain cars as well,external- via the firm's CarPlay software. Many brands - including BMW, Nissan, Hyundai and Ford - have produced models that support it. Car-makers are interested in bringing such functionality to their vehicles as a means of making them easier to interact with - and to connect home appliances to drivers while they are on the road. With Alexa,Ford plans to give drivers,externalthe ability to close net-connected garage doors, or to play an audiobook, picking up from wherever they had previously left off. In Hyundai's case, Google Assistantwill integrate with the firm's Blue Link software,external. Drivers will be able to start the car, adjust air conditioning, lock the doors or send destination details to the vehicle by voice alone. A sample command given by the firm was: ""OK Google, tell Blue Link to start my Santa Fe and set the temperature to 72 degrees."" The tech giants are vying for a place not just in your home - but also your car BMW discussed a handful of ways drivers might use its digital platform, BMW Connected, and Cortana in future cars - including booking restaurant tables. ""BMW Connected can provide a reminder en-route of an upcoming appointment for which no location has yet been fixed,"" the company said. ""And Cortana can be used to make a suitable restaurant recommendation and reserve a table."" Toyota also announced a futuristic concept car at CES, the Concept-i.It features its own digital assistant, named Yui,external. ""It's really going to be a battle of the giants, starting in 2017,"" said Adam Simon, a tech analyst at Context. ""In exactly the same way that Amazon is doing a great job at the moment of building an ecosystem in the home, there'll be an ecosystem in the car,"" he told the BBC. Microsoft boss Satya Nadella has said he believes digital assistants will change the web Some car manufacturers, including Ford, are already warning drivers not to be distracted when using such products. Last year, researchers at the University of Sussex found that using a hands-free device while drivingwas as distracting as picking up a phone. ""In the very long play we can see vehicles becoming a real entertainment space - an extension of people's lounges,"" said Jack Wetherill, a tech analyst at Futuresource. ""The real endgame is we all put our feet up and watch movies, the digital assistant does the driving."" In the short-term, he said that Amazon was likely hoping to encourage more purchases of entertainment content from its online store - such content could then be listened to in the car or watched by passengers.

The jacket that lets you stash 42 gadgets,"Scotte Vest doesn't advise using all 42 pockets at once As I swim in the ocean of shiny new tech that surrounds me at CES, I find myself wondering where on earth I would put all this stuff if I had to take it with me. One firm I met there thinks it has the answer - in the form of a jacket with 42 secret pockets, each tailored for a specific device. Scotte Vest's $150 (Â£120) sleeveless gilet is an Aladdin's cave of pockets: it includes a laptop-sized space on the back, somewhere to store a tablet in each of the front panels, an inside breast pocket for smartphones made out of touchscreen-friendly material and a channel for headphone cables or chargers. It also contains a sunglasses pouch with attached cleaning cloth. However, the firm does not recommend using all 42 pockets at once. ""It is having a pocket for what you need at the moment,"" said spokesman Luke Lappala. ""If style isn't necessarily your number one priority, you could fit everything you ever need in there."" Scotte Vest's gilet has a rival in AyeGear's J25 jacket I can vouch for that, after stashing my 11in (28cm) laptop, charging cable and plug, smartphone, tablet, radio equipment, battery power bar and notebook in a single Scotte Vest garment. I didn't look or feel particularly elegant, and the weight of the laptop alone almost tipped me over twice - but once the load had settled onto my shoulders I began to feel like I was wearing a backpack rather than a gilet. It was surprisingly difficult to get everything back out again after this little experiment. I could feel the charger about my person but it took me a while to locate the pocket it was in. Helpfully, each garment comes with a small fabric map setting out the location of all the pockets. The idea was born in the year 2000 when chief executive Scott Jordan almost damaged his ears in an airport after getting a headphone cable tangled on a doorknob, Mr Lappala told me. It was inspired by the traditional fisherman's vest. The laptop pocket is on the back of the coat, making it feel like a backpack Scotte Vest claims to have sold more than 10 million garments so far, ranging from trench coats to shorts, all with varying tallies of pockets. It is great for travellers, said Mr Lappala. And drone pilots. The firm even has a rival in the form of the J25 made by AyeGear - although as its name suggests, that one has a mere 25 storage areas.

Puppets beat Bowie to LP cover prize,"Everything You've Come to Expect came top of the poll while Blackstar (right) came second A record cover featuring a 1969 image of Tina Turner has beaten David Bowie's final release Blackstar to a prize for the year's best album artwork. The Last Shadow Puppets' Everything You've Come to Expect was selected from50 entrants,externalin the annual awards. Mark Pritchard's photo landscapes for his Under the Sun record came third, according to a public vote. Now in its 11th year, the prize is organised by Art Vinyl, a company that promotes record covers as art. The announcementfollows newsthat vinyl sales topped three million last year - the highest UK total in 25 years. The Last Shadow Puppets was formed by Miles Kane (left) of The Rascals and Arctic Monkeys' Alex Turner Illustrator Matthew Cooper used a photo of Turner taken by Vogue's Jack Robinson to decorate the cover for the Last Shadow Puppets' second album. ""The idea was to move the artwork on from the '60s feel of the first Last Shadow Puppets album artwork, so here is Tina on the very cusp of the 1970s,"" he explained. The original black-and-white image was given a gold tint ""to create an identifiable colour scheme and a warmer, more contemporary feel."" Blackstar was released shortly before Bowie's death in January last year at the age of 69. David Gilmour's Rattle That Lock albumwon last year's prize.

Fighting back,"In 1986 Jill Saward, who has died aged 51, was raped after a gang of burglars broke into the Ealing vicarage where she lived. Her father, Michael - the vicar of St Mary's, Ealing - and her boyfriend were beaten with cricket bats by the men, who demanded money and jewellery. It was a sexual attack that shocked the nation, became headline news and was subsequently labelled the ""Ealing vicarage rape"". The media coverage of the case and the sentencing of the men who attacked Ms Saward - who later became Jill Drake - led to a public outcry about how rape victims were treated. Ringleader Robert Horscroft, then 34, who did not take part in the rape, was sentenced to 14 years in jail for his part in the burglary. Martin McCall, then 22, was given five years for rape and a further five for burglary, while Christopher Byrne, who was also 22, was given three years for his part in the sexual assault and five for the burglary. During sentencing, Old Bailey Judge Sir John Leonard said the trauma suffered by Ms Saward was ""not so very great"". Ms Saward's case affected the way rape victims were treated and is still being felt 30 years later. The public backlash against the media coverage and subsequent sentencing helped bring about changes to the way sexual assault cases were viewed. In particular, there was uproar at how one of the defendants had been given a longer sentence for the burglary than the attack. Several MPs, including Neil Kinnock, criticised the prison terms handed down - saying they were too lenient. The then-Labour leader said during a Commons debate in 1987: ""While it is necessary for judges to remain detached in the name of the law, sometimes they show an insensitivity to the suffering of victims which is difficult to comprehend."" And Margaret Thatcher, who was prime minister at the time, expressed her ""deep concern"" over the crime of rape following concerns about the case. Ms Saward's case also sparked fierce criticisms about press coverage of rape cases after Ms Saward's ordeal became front page news. While newspapers did not name Ms Saward as the victim, several of them published details which led her to be easily identifiable. This video can not be played Jill Saward, who was gang raped in 1986, says her attackers got the same sentence as for aggravated burglary The Sun newspaper printed the location of the attack and a photograph of Ms Saward with her eyes blacked out in the days following the rape. When investigated, the publication relied on the defence that media identification of a victim was only banned after a defendant was charged, which was the case at the time. Speaking in 1987 Ms Saward, who was an identical twin, demanded a change in the law to prevent this from happening. According to the Guardian, she said: ""Unless this is done, others may find themselves identifiable by a process of deduction from third parties known to be involved as victims of a crime as I was. ""This was very distressing both to myself and my family, and the manner in which some newspapers conveyed this information was highly insensitive and offensive."" The law was changed a year later to allow for the right to appeal against lenient sentences and to close a loophole which allowed media identification of a rape victim before a defendant was charged. The Press Council also published guidelines on how rape cases were reported to prevent victims' anonymity being breached through jigsaw identification. The notorious case put the laws on rape under the spotlight and led to calls by women's groups and politicians to call for changes to the way the crimes were viewed. These included making rape within marriage a criminal offence, making oral and anal intercourse classified as rape and tougher sentencing for rapists - all of which have been achieved. In 1990, Ms Saward broke new ground when she became the first rape victim in the UK to waive her right to anonymity. She co-wrote a book, Rape: My Story, which explored her ordeal and she went on to become a fierce campaigner for the rights of sexual assault victims. Her decision to speak publicly was driven by a desire to change attitudes towards victims and strengthen the support they receive. Ms Saward launched a help group for those who had experienced sex crimes and regularly appeared in the media to highlight issues faced by victims. Her commitment to the cause also saw her become a sexual assault case worker and she subsequently provided training to police forces across the country. Over the years, further changes have been made to the way sexual assault cases are handled - taking into account the way victims were treated. These include a ban on allowing an alleged rapist to cross-examine victims while representing themselves in court and restrictions on what evidence can be heard about a victim's sexual behaviour. New guidelines were published on the sentencing of sex offenders in England and Wales in 2013 which gave a greater emphasis on the impact on the victim - something Ms Saward had long campaigned for. Speaking to the BBC, she said: ""So long we've felt left out of the system or surplus to requirement, so to actually see victims' needs and what's happened to victims being put at the forefront of this is really, really good."" Ms Saward never gave up on her fight for victims' rights, and in 2015 she spoke out against calls to give those accused of sex crimes anonymity. In 1998, she came face-to-face with a member of the gang who devastated her life, but did not rape her, and told him: ""You don't need to say sorry."" But she also spoke about forgiveness and said in a BBC interview: ""I believe forgiveness gives you freedom. Freedom to move on without being held back by the past.""
