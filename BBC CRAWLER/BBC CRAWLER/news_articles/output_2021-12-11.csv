More Covid rules could come next week in Scotland,"This video can not be played John Swinney: Scottish government assessing whether further Covid measures are needed New Covid restrictions could be introduced in Scotland next week, the deputy first minister has warned. John Swinney says the Scottish government is ""wrestling with the challenge"" of the surge of the Omicron variant. New self-isolation rules have come into force as Scotland recorded 4,087 new Covid cases on Saturday. All household contacts of someone with the virus should now isolate for 10 days, regardless of vaccination status. The new isolation rules also apply to household contacts even if they initially get a negative PCR test. Covid: Scotland facing 'tsunami' of Omicron cases What are the Covid rules in Scotland? Non-household contacts of someone with Covid are permitted to leave isolation if they have had a negative PCR test and two vaccine doses. Scientists are warning that the UK isfacing a substantial wave of Omicron infections in Januarywithout further restrictions. In an interview withBBC Breakfast, the deputy first minister said the Scottish government would spend the weekend deciding what to do next. All household contacts of someone with the virus should now isolate for 10 days Mr Swinney said: ""We are looking at whether we need to take further measures to try to arrest the circulation of the virus. We had a huge rise in cases yesterday and that suggests we have an escalating problem. ""The government is wrestling with the challenge of what are the right rules to have in place over this weekend. We will share details of any changes with parliament over the next few days."" Mr Swinney said there was a danger of the virus overwhelming public and private services, but said he hoped a restricted Christmas would not happen. He said the Scottish government was ""working very hard"" to avoid this by asking the public to reduce social interaction and take lateral flow tests. ""We are encouraging people to take these steps so that we can protect the precious time that is Christmas time for families,"" he added. ""We know how hard that was last year and we want to avoid a repeat of that."" On Saturday the total number of Omicron cases across nine of the Scotland's 14 health boards reached 121. There were 4,087 new cases of the virus, a rise on the recent daily average of about 2,800 cases. Public Health Scotland (PHS) said there was a delay in test results being reported, so the actual figures will be higher. A further 12 deaths were also confirmed following a positive test. The number of people in hospital fell slightly to 552, with 53 patients in intensive care. Omicron study suggests major wave in January People urged to cancel Christmas parties in Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that the current numbers were only the ""tip of the iceberg"" with cases doubling every two to three days - the fastest growth seen during the whole pandemic. She warned a media briefing this week that there wasan oncoming ""tsunami"" of Omicron cases. PHS has urged people to cancel Christmas parties, in a move that hospitality venues said triggered ""non-stop cancellations"". Ms Sturgeon said there was a focus on these events, as the new variant posed a big risk to workplaces. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce said financial compensation should be made available to affected businesses. This video can not be played Professor Linda Bauld said festive restrictions are ""a possibility"" University of Edinburgh public health expert Prof Linda Bauld said she hoped this Christmas would not be a repeat of last year. Speaking to the BBC Radio Scotland'sGood Morning Scotland, she also said more restrictions could come next week. Prof Bauld said: ""Everybody wants to avoid shutting businesses again and that would be the last resort, but clearly across the country, decision-makers have to look at the menu of options and decide what is proportionate."" She said lockdown was a last resort, but people may be asked to cut back on socialising plans. But she added: ""Isolation, loneliness and separation from loved ones is something we also want to avoid."" Meanwhile, ward 7a at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness has been closed to new admissions after a Covid outbreak. Visiting has also been stopped. NHS bosses said it was not connected to an outbreak on ward 5a of the same hospital last week. Testing will establish if it is the Omicron variant that has closed the wards. Rising case numbers are also putting pressure on other areas. ScotRail has already cancelled 60 train services due to staff shortages as a result of Covid. The operator also dropped their festive Santa Express trips on the Fife Circle line this weekend. Scientists warned on Friday thattwo doses of a Covid vaccineare not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant - although a third booster dose significantly increases protection to around 75%. Vaccines are still likely to offer good protection against severe Covid that would need hospital treatment.

Daughter of first US astronaut blasts into space,"Laura Shepard Churchley's (left) father became the first US astronaut in space in 1961 The daughter of the first US astronaut, Alan Shepard, has blasted into space - 60 years after her father's flight. Laura Shepard Churchley, 74, was one of six people to make the trip onboard a commercial spacecraft launched by Jeff Bezos' Blue Origin space company. The passengers were briefly able to experience zero gravity on the sub-orbital flight. The flight was the third launched by Blue Origin in 2021 as it seeks to capture the space tourism market. Ms Shepard Churchley's father, who died in 1998, became the first American in space after his Mercury flight took off from Florida's Cape Canaveral on 5 May 1961. Former NFL star and Good Morning America anchor Michael Strahan was also on Saturday's flight as well as four other paying customers. It marked the first time that Blue Origin had filled all six seats on its New Shepard rocket, which is named after the astronaut. Having been delayed for two days by fierce winds, the flight finally blasted off from the company's launch facility near the rural town of Van Horn, Texas. The flight followed a similar path to previous rockets launched by the company, before landing in the Texas desert where the tourists were greeted by Mr Bezos. Lasting for just over 10 minutes and reaching an altitude of around 62 miles (100km), it was five minutes and 116 miles shorter than Alan Shepard's inaugural flight. His daughter brought along a small piece of his capsule, as well as some mementosfrom his later trip to the lunar surfaceaboard Apollo 14 in 1971. ""I thought about Daddy coming down and thought, gosh he didn't even get to enjoy any of what I'm getting to enjoy,"" Ms Shepard Churchley said. ""He was working. He had to do it himself. I went up for the ride!"".

Queues form as Banksy statue T-shirts go on sale,"Early risers lined up outside That Thing on Stokes Croft in Bristol, where the queue was estimated to be 200 strong Large queues formed as limited-edition T-shirts made by anonymous street artist Banksy went on sale. The Bristol-born artistannounced on Friday nightthat the shirts would go on sale at locations in the city. He said they had been created to show support for the four people about to go on trial accused of pulling down the statue of slave trader Edward Colston. The shirts quickly began appearing for resale online, with one seller asking for Â£9,000. Local radio station Ujima began announcing the sale points on its breakfast show from 09:00 GMT. Once the locations were made public hundreds of people quickly formed a queue at one of them - That Thing on Stokes Croft. Similar queues appeared outside Friendly Records in Bedminster and Rough Trade on Nelson Street. Harvey, Rosie and Emily from Easter Compton in Somerset managed to get a T-shirt each People began queuing as soon as local radio station Ujima announced the T-shirt sale locations Sales of the T-shirt were limited Among the hundreds of people who queued outside the Rough Trade record shop were brother and sister Tom and Rosie Levins. ""When we got in the queue, I don't think we were really confident,"" Miss Levins said. Her brother added: ""I collect all the Banksy stuff I can get hold off. When stuff comes up in Bristol and you get a chance..."" In an Instagram post, Banksy said the shirts would be limited to one per person, and proceeds would go ""to the defendants so they can go for a pint"". Jake Skuse, Rhian Graham, Milo Ponsford and Sage Willoughby all deny criminal damage relating to the removal of the statue and face trial at Bristol Crown Court on Monday. The statue of Edward Colston, a 17th Century slave trader, was pulled down during a Black Lives Matter protest in Bristol in June 2020.

Rail boss wants equivalent HS2 funding for Wales,"This is what the new HS2 trains could look like when they go into service from the end of the decade - but they will not be visiting Wales Wales should not lose out on funding because the HS2 high-speed rail line is classed as a Welsh project despite not entering the country, a rail boss said. Transport for Wales (TfW) chief James Price said the railways needed significant investment but it was ""very difficult to do"" without more cash. The UK government's own analysis estimated HS2 would havean overall negative impacton Wales. The Department for Transport (DfT) said it would bring more frequent trains. HS2 is ahigh-speed rail line planned to link London with Birmingham, with not a single inch of track laid in Wales. Trains fundamentally safe, says TfW boss Wales v Australia sees more packed trains It is currently classified as an England and Wales project by officials in Westminster, meaning the Welsh government does not receive a proportionate amount of what is known as a top-up ""Barnett consequential"". ""Clearly, I don't think that's right,"" said Mr Price. ""If you look at the figures, some of the UK government's own figures suggest that whilst HS2 is good for the country as a whole, it's not necessarily good for Wales. ""And in order for it to be good for Wales, Wales needs to invest significantly in rail infrastructure and without those consequentials, obviously, it's very difficult to do that."" Map showing the HS2 rail line Mr Price called for full ""consequentials"" from HS2 to come to Wales. The Welsh government and a cross-party group of MPs have calledfor HS2 to be reclassifiedas an England-only project. A report by the Commons' Welsh affairs select committee said the Welsh government received ""approximately Â£755m in Barnett consequentials"" between 2015 and 2019 as result of DfT spending money on HS2. However, because the project is classed as ""England and Wales"", it would ""not benefit in the same way as Scotland and Northern Ireland from Barnett consequentials"". The report also said HS2 could ""yield direct benefits to Welsh rail passengers if it is accompanied by enhancement to the north Wales mainline"". When the UK government decides to spend more or less on public services in England, the Barnett formula is used to decide how much money the other nations receive. This sum is called the Barnett consequential. It reflects differences in population size plus the range of devolved public services in each nation. Since this money is not ringfenced, the devolved governments are free to spend the consequential on services other than the UK government's area of spending. Devolution: What's the Barnett formula? Which parts of the UK have the most money spent on them? Mr Price has called for funding to help upgrade the train lines in Wales In 2017, the UK governmentscrapped plans to electrify the railway linebetween Cardiff and Swansea. A recent review of transport across the UKmade no mention of plans to electrify the networkin the north and south of Wales. From a climate change perspective, Mr Price added: ""My personal view is that we will have to see Network Rail and the UK government electrify the rest of the network in Wales. ""At the minute there looks like there's very little other technology that's available to do it."" He added electrification beyond current plans for the London line to Cardiff and the valleys lines ""does feel like something that we absolutely need"". Mr Price has said he is ""not happy"" withsome commuters' experiences of overcrowdingon Welsh trains. Speaking toPolitics Wales, he said Wales' current service was ""probably a mid-tier UK rail system which, when we think about it, compared to the best in the world is probably not very good and we want to do a whole lot better, which is why we are on a journey to try and transform rail across Wales"". The pandemic has resulted in a drop in rail passengers, with current numbers ""above 71% of pre-Covid"" use of Welsh services, according to Mr Price. But he said the figures were ""varying massively across the network, so some parts of the network are far busier than they were before, some parts of the network are less busy"". In June, it was announced TfW would get another Â£70m of taxpayers' funding to make up for a drop in passenger numbers,on top of about Â£167m of extra fundingfrom the Welsh government. Mr Price said: ""Until we get back up to around 100%, the extra subsidy that was coming in will have to continue to come in or we'll have to run less services."" The DfT said HS2 would ""provide faster and more frequent train services to Wales"", with the interchange at Crewe bringing ""many parts"" of the country within two-and-a-quarter hours of London. It added: ""We have already committed over Â£2bn to the Welsh railways in recent years and we're now carefully considering the recommendations ofSir Peter Hendy's independent Union Connectivity Review.""

Loneliness fears over Covid Christmas uncertainty,"Last year, plans to relax restrictions were scrapped and only two households could meet on Christmas Day People fear having their Christmas plans scuppered for a second year amid concern over the Covid variant Omicron. Wales' coronavirus rules are now beingreviewed weekly instead of every three weeksin response to the new variant. The organiser of a group Christmas Day lunch to combat loneliness said those attending would be ""devastated"" if it was cancelled by new restrictions. About 50 international students in Vale of Glamorgan who are unable to travel home will stay on campus for Christmas. Wales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan has said it istoo early to say if there will be festive restrictions. But the Welsh government has urged people to take lateral flow tests before going shopping, to Christmas parties or visiting others, and extended guidance on mask-wearing to pubs and restaurants, when people are not eating. Last year, plans to relax Covid rules from 23 to 27 December to allow people to meet loved oneswere scrapped with just a few days' notice. Instead, only two households were allowed to meet on Christmas Day only. While there is no official guidance telling people to cancel party plans, health officials atCardiff and Vale University Health Board have urged people not to attend parties, after huge demand at A&E departments. Are Christmas parties being cancelled over Omicron? Stereophonics Cardiff gigs postponed amid Omicron concerns Omicron: How do you detect it? Almuqtada Al-Yasiri will not be spending Christmas with family in Iraq in case new rules are introduced that stop him returning to Wales Almuqtada Al-Yasiri, 17, from Iraq, is one of about 50 students at Atlantic College in Vale of Glamorgan who will spend Christmas on the St Donats campus because of the pandemic. ""My plan was to go back home for this Christmas break,"" he said. ""I really miss my family and I want to spend time with them, but the fact is because of Covid I don't want to risk it. ""If I go back, we might have a lockdown... I have exams coming so I don't want to take that risk."" He said playing piano and the college's peers listening programme were helping keep his spirits up: ""Whenever I'm having a bad time, I just talk with them and they make my day better."" Despite the disappointment he said he was looking forward to Christmas at the college and cooking with his fellow students Atlantic College, based at a 12th Century castle, is home to about 350 16 to 19-year-olds from all over the world Since 2012, councillor Guy Woodham has run an annual Christmas Day lunch in Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire, for about 100 people who would otherwise spend the day alone. He was forced to cancel Christmas Together for the first time last year. This year the event is going ahead but with numbers reduced to 30 and all attending must be double-vaccinated, wear masks when not seated at the table and social distance where possible. He said he had been convinced of the need to go ahead by those who wanted to attend: ""They would actually get in touch or, if I was out and about, would speak to me and say 'please go ahead with it' and tell me their individual stories - that was the real driver. ""It was realising from having those personal conversations that for some people, it was really important to try to do it."" Christmas Together last went ahead in 2019 He said some who had attended in previous years had decided ""despite being lonely they actually would feel safer just staying at home for Christmas"". He is hoping new restrictions will not be introduced that force him to cancel: ""It would be devastating if there was an announcement that we couldn't gather on Christmas Day, but we would have to respect that. Does Wales have its own Covid Plan B? Covid in Wales: What do the stats tell us? NHS Tracker: How is the NHS in your area coping? ""It would be devastating for me, for those involved, and especially those people who made it clear that they don't want to be alone on Christmas Day for very valid personal reasons. ""It's not going to be the same as it has been previously, but hopefully what we do provide will give people some enjoyment on the day, rather than fear and unhappiness of being lonely."" Ammanford Evangelical Church in Carmarthenshire has put on an annual Christmas Day lunch for those who would otherwise be alone or unable to afford a traditional Christmas for more than 20 years. Its in-person event is off for a second Christmas and volunteers will instead be delivering meals cooked by a local pub. Pastor Sammy Davies said: ""People are definitely missing out on spending time together. ""I've actually been surprised how many people have got in touch hoping and expecting it to be in-person again his year... wanting to see each other physically again... so I think that desire is there."" He said people receiving meals would still have some ""human contact"" on Christmas Day, and volunteers had been encouraged to take time to talk on people's doorsteps. He said people had learnt to adapt: ""I think people have become robust and are just dealing with it and grasping opportunities when they come, and being grateful even for the small things that we can do for each other too."" Kimberly Dienes, a lecturer in clinical and health psychology at Swansea University, said it was important people communicated with loved ones about how they want to spend their Christmas in light of the new variant. ""You need to sit down and really talk,"" she said. ""Don't avoid it, have those difficult discussions about what you're going to do."" Kimberly Dienes advised people to ""pay attention to what makes you happy"" when things are unpredictable She said many had found the uncertainty of the past 21 months very difficult, but focusing on acceptance could help. ""We can't predict the futureâ¦ we just have to tolerate ambiguity, to accept uncertainty... focus on things that we can know and the things that we can control,"" she said. ""What you have to do is pay attention to what makes you happy."" Performer andloneliness campaignerCarys Eleri has spent much of the pandemic living with her mother in Upper Tumble, Carmarthenshire. She has planned a small family Christmas and drinks with friends but has come to terms with the fact that the pandemic means plans do not always work out. ""I tried to lower my expectations and just be quite relaxed about this and think of the bigger picture - I'm safe and healthy and my family are healthy,"" she said. Carys Eleri wants everyone to send Christmas cards and phone loved ones to combat loneliness She said she kept her spirits up by taking up running and spending more time in the countryside through the pandemic. She said at the moment people should try not to cancel plans they have made with others. ""Especially if they are alone, they might have been really building up to see you,"" she said. ""I'm a single person, people around you have massive families and if they cancel something their life is busy anyway. ""I might be really looking forward to that interaction, so if you do cancel something, rearrange something quite quickly - just take care of each other, be really mindful of each other's situations."" She also urged everyone to send Christmas cards this year. ""We're used to text messages, emails, social media, sending a couple of Christmas trees emojis on Facebook... but it doesn't give any connection with that person. ""When you see the handwriting that gives so much of that person to you. ""Phone calls and Christmas cards - please do those things.""

Stormont budget proposes health funding boost,"The finance minister has said the budget's main priority would be health The Stormont draft budget is proposing a 10% increase in health funding, but a squeeze on all other departments. The majority of the Executive voted to put the three-year budget plan out to public consultation from next week. But DUP ministers voted against the move. Ministers had previously agreed to prioritise health and use the majority of funding to deal with the crisis including waiting lists. But BBC News NI understands some are unhappy about the cuts being proposed to their respective budgets. First Minister Paul Givan said he supported increased funding for health, however, he accused the budget paper of lacking a detailed plan for how the service will be transformed. ""We want to see that transformation plan, because with that additional funding the people of Northern Ireland need to see real changes as to the experiences that they have in the health service,"" he said. Health Minister Robin Swann said the budget was about starting the ""transformation process"" of the health service. A meeting of the executive on Friday morning was requested by Finance Minister Conor Murphy to sign off the draft budget before public consultation. Speaking afterwards, Mr Murphy explained: ""We don't have the resources that we need for everything, so that means there are choices to be made."" ""The proposition going out is to prioritise health, to support health, to get waiting lists down, to support mental health provision and cancer provision,"" he added. Conor Murphy said the executive did not have the resources to meet all its priorities Details of the plan will be outlined in the assembly next week. It includes moves to freeze regional rates and provide a one-month rates holiday to all businesses with the exception of utilities and larger food stores. There will be a three-months rates break for retail, tourism, hospitality, leisure, childcare and airports. A multi-year UK spending review announced earlier this yearallowed the executive to produce its own multi-year spending plan. Here is the proposed financial allocations for each Stormont department in the draft budget plans for 2022-2025. It's broken down by resource budget, which is largely spent on the running of services and resources, and capital budget, which is mostly used for major infrastructure or investment projects. Department of Health: Â£20.9bn resource; Â£1.1bn capital Department of Education: Â£7.4bn resource; Â£582m capital Department for Infrastructure: Â£1.3bn resource; Â£2.4bn capital Department of Justice: Â£3.4bn resource; Â£353m capital Department for Communities: Â£2.5bn resource; Â£631m capital Department for the Economy: Â£2.5bn resource; Â£582m capital Department of Agriculture, Environment and Rural Affairs: Â£1.7bn resource budget; Â£327m capital budget The Executive Office: Â£670m resource; Â£45m capital Department of Finance: Â£510m resource; Â£105m capital Mr Murphy said there was ""an opportunity over three years"" to fulfil commitments made to transform healthcare. ""If we're going to walk the walk, having talked the talk in relation to supporting health over the last number of years, and all executive parties have repeatedly said health is a priority, this is the opportunity to match that with some resource and funding,"" he continued. The finance minister explained ""there is no money tree here available"" if ministers, MLAs or the public wish to change the draft budget. ""If people want to change that then they need to say where they're finding the money to do that from,"" Mr Murphy said. ""If that's coming back off health then they need to be upfront in saying that."" Health Minister Robin Swann said the budget was about ""starting to redress the 10 years of financial underinvestment in our health service"". He said there needed to be a stripping of party politics from the budget. ""It is about allowing us to actually start the transformation process that we need to do, it also gives that surety that we have been asking for of a three-year budget and that has been part of the challenge as well."" Naomi Long says while health is a priority, all departments have a responsibility to drive up health outcomes for the public Justice Minister Naomi Long is among ministers who have expressed concerns about the current draft budget. While she has agreed that the draft budget should go out to public consultation, she is not yet prepared to agree to its content. ""There's no point us presenting it to the public as a fait accompli,"" she said. ""What we have agreed however, and I think what the public would expect us to agree, is that health is our priority going forward. ""However for me that is about health outcomes, and I think all departments have a real responsibility in terms of their own job, to drive up health outcomes and to deliver better for people."" Mrs Long is understood to believe allocations for her department are ""not adequate to maintain an efficient, effective and functional justice system"". The first minister said the DUP also had reservations about the draft budget's impact on the number of police officers. ""Ultimately we will seek to address the deficiencies that exist within this budget before there is a final agreement ultimately in March,"" Mr Givan outlined. The SDLP's finance spokesperson, Matthew O'Toole said his party supported the focus on health and for the draft budget to go out for public consultation, however, there were ""serious concerns"" about cuts elsewhere. ""That is a political choice that Conor Murphy has made, but clearly did not command the support of any ministers outside of his own party at the executive today,"" he said. ""Public services have been placed under immense strain over the course of the last 20 months. This is not the time to cut back further."" Mr O'Toole said the consultation would be ""an opportunity for people to have their say on those priorities"". The opening position of the health budget was Â£6.45bn this year and will rise to just over Â£7.1bn by 2024/25. The increase is partially funded by a 2% cut in the baseline of all other departments budgets. That means that although those departments will still see their budgets rise in cash terms, some will probably experience a real cut when inflation is considered. The Finance Minister Conor Murphy acknowledged that would present ""significant challenges"" for some departments but that the executive had agreed health would be its top priority. Other measures in the budget include an extension of the business rates ""holiday"". Rates are property taxes, but some sectors have been exempt for the past two years as a pandemic support measure. Those exemptions were due to end in April but most business will get a further one-month exemption with those in sectors like retail, hospitality and childcare getting three months. Large food shops and utilities will not get an exemption. The domestic and non-domestic regional rate will also be frozen over the budget period.

Progress made on NI Protocol medicines issueUK's Brexit minister says he will meet his EU counterpart twice next week following talks on Friday.Northern IrelandComments,"There have been warnings the full implementation of the NI protocol could lead to some medicines being withdrawn in NI Further progress has been made in talks about guaranteeing the supply of medicines from Britain to Northern Ireland, UK's Brexit minister has said. The NI Protocol means Northern Ireland is still covered by the EU's pharmaceutical regulations. Lord Frost was speaking after a meeting with European Commission Vice President MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ. He said they would meet twice next week in the hope of ""making worthwhile progress"" before Christmas. Lord Frost said he ""underlined the need for movement on all the difficult issues created by the protocol"", including customs, agrifood rules and the role of the European Court of Justice (ECJ). ""We will not find a durable solution that does not deal with all these problems,"" he added. Earlier, several European media outlets had reported that the UK wants to concentrate on addressing practical problems and was placing less emphasis on the role of the ECJ. It is understood that a senior official held a video conference with London-based EU journalists. Irish broadcaster RTÃ said the official described this change in emphasis as ""an important shift"". Lord Frost (left) and MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ (right) - pictured at a previous meeting in October RTÃ also reported that the British official said that if the UK ever had to use Article 16 - the so-called safeguard clause in the protocol - it would be done in a way that was ""very limited and very focused on practical issues"". Article 16 allows parts of the protocol to be unilaterally suspended if they are causing serious problems or leading to diversion of trade. The German newspaper Die Welt reported the official as saying: ""'Nobody on Belfast's streets is protesting to get rid of ECJ. We now focus on medicines and customs."" The Northern Ireland Protocol leaves Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods, a market which includes medicines. It was agreed by the UK and EU in October 2019 as a way to avoid a hardening of the Irish land border. Q&A: The NI Protocol medicines issue explained 'Patients at risk' if medicines withdrawn from NI That means goods can flow freely between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, but goods arriving from the rest of the UK are subject to controls to ensure they comply with EU standards. Northern Ireland gets most of its medicines from distributors and manufacturers in Great Britain but, due to a 'grace period', controls have not yet been imposed on the movement of those products. The industry has warned that if the protocol as it stands is ever fully implementedit will mean major difficulties in importing medicines from Great Britain. Northern Ireland gets most of its medicines from GB distributors The EU acknowledged the requirements are too much of a burden and should be removed, subject to some conditions. BBC News NI understands that the EU could shortly begin the process of changing its laws as part of a solution. Northern Ireland Health Minister Robin Swann said on Friday he would need to consider the ""fine detail"" of any legislation, as it ""does make a difference to the people of Northern Ireland"". He said he was waiting on the EU publishing its proposals and on how the pharmaceutical industry and ""stakeholders"" react to legislation which he hoped to see ""this side of Christmas"". Mr Swann added that it was ""about seeing the final document, seeing how it will impact us"" but that he was committed to ""making sure there is the least disruption of supply of medicines coming into Northern Ireland"".

Russia faces consequences if Ukraine invaded - Truss,"This video can not be played UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss says if Russia invades Ukraine it would be a ""strategic mistake"" Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has warned Russia it will face ""severe economic consequences"" if it invades Ukraine. She said G7 foreign ministers meeting in Liverpool this weekend would put on a show of unity and make clear such a move would be a ""strategic mistake"". Ms Truss said the UK and its allies had to ""deter Russia from taking that course of action"". Tensions are growing as Moscow amasses troops on Ukraine's border - but the Kremlin has denied it plans to invade. Reiterating previous warnings from the US and its allies, Ms Truss said the G7 ""are going to absolutely be strong in our stance against aggression... with respect to Ukraine"". She added: ""If Russia were to take that action, it would be a strategic mistake, and there will be severe consequences for Russia. ""And what we're doing this weekend is working with like-minded allies to spell that out."" Putin compares Ukraine war zone to genocide Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? What would be the fallout if Russia invaded Ukraine? What next for Ukraine after Putin-Biden talks? Ukraine shares borders with both the EU and Russia, but as a former Soviet republic it has deep social and cultural ties with Russia. However, Russia has accused Ukraine of provocation, and sought guarantees against eastward Nato expansion and deployment of weapons close to its border. Ahead of the G7 meeting, Ms Truss held talks with Ukrainian foreign minister Dmytro Kuleba in London. Asked if she could rule out a military response to Russian aggression, Ms Truss said the UK was working with Ukraine on ""defence and security capability"". A Russian soldier on exercises in Kazan last month ""We are providing them with support,"" she said. ""We are also working to help them with their energy resilience. So they're not solely dependent on Russian energy supplies. And that is the way ultimately that we will help support Ukraine."" Ms Truss said the UK and EU were trying to ensure Western economies were less dependent on Russian energy. The foreign secretary said the Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline between Germany and Russia would be ""a problem"" if Russia invaded Ukraine. It would be an issue to discuss with her new German counterpart at the G7 talks. Ms Truss said: ""We absolutely need to reduce dependence on Russian gas and energy. And this should be part of an overall strategy of reducing dependence on non-market economies, reducing dependence on malign actors, and making sure that the free world is able to have that strategic independence it needs to survive and thrive."" US President Joe Biden and Russian President Vladimir Putin on Tuesday held avirtual summit aimed at reducing tensionsin the region. Mr Biden said he had made it clear to Mr Putin that there would be ""economic consequences like none he's ever seen"" if he invaded Ukraine.

"More Covid rules could come next week, says SwinneyThe Deputy First minister says the government is ""wrestling with the challenge"" of surging Omicron cases.Scotland","This video can not be played John Swinney: Scottish government assessing whether further Covid measures are needed New Covid restrictions could be introduced in Scotland next week, the deputy first minister has warned. John Swinney says the Scottish government is ""wrestling with the challenge"" of the surge of the Omicron variant. New self-isolation rules have come into force as Scotland recorded 4,087 new Covid cases on Saturday. All household contacts of someone with the virus should now isolate for 10 days, regardless of vaccination status. The new isolation rules also apply to household contacts even if they initially get a negative PCR test. Covid: Scotland facing 'tsunami' of Omicron cases What are the Covid rules in Scotland? Non-household contacts of someone with Covid are permitted to leave isolation if they have had a negative PCR test and two vaccine doses. Scientists are warning that the UK isfacing a substantial wave of Omicron infections in Januarywithout further restrictions. In an interview withBBC Breakfast, the deputy first minister said the Scottish government would spend the weekend deciding what to do next. All household contacts of someone with the virus should now isolate for 10 days Mr Swinney said: ""We are looking at whether we need to take further measures to try to arrest the circulation of the virus. We had a huge rise in cases yesterday and that suggests we have an escalating problem. ""The government is wrestling with the challenge of what are the right rules to have in place over this weekend. We will share details of any changes with parliament over the next few days."" Mr Swinney said there was a danger of the virus overwhelming public and private services, but said he hoped a restricted Christmas would not happen. He said the Scottish government was ""working very hard"" to avoid this by asking the public to reduce social interaction and take lateral flow tests. ""We are encouraging people to take these steps so that we can protect the precious time that is Christmas time for families,"" he added. ""We know how hard that was last year and we want to avoid a repeat of that."" On Saturday the total number of Omicron cases across nine of the Scotland's 14 health boards reached 121. There were 4,087 new cases of the virus, a rise on the recent daily average of about 2,800 cases. Public Health Scotland (PHS) said there was a delay in test results being reported, so the actual figures will be higher. A further 12 deaths were also confirmed following a positive test. The number of people in hospital fell slightly to 552, with 53 patients in intensive care. Omicron study suggests major wave in January People urged to cancel Christmas parties in Scotland First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said that the current numbers were only the ""tip of the iceberg"" with cases doubling every two to three days - the fastest growth seen during the whole pandemic. She warned a media briefing this week that there wasan oncoming ""tsunami"" of Omicron cases. PHS has urged people to cancel Christmas parties, in a move that hospitality venues said triggered ""non-stop cancellations"". Ms Sturgeon said there was a focus on these events, as the new variant posed a big risk to workplaces. The Scottish Chambers of Commerce said financial compensation should be made available to affected businesses. This video can not be played Professor Linda Bauld said festive restrictions are ""a possibility"" University of Edinburgh public health expert Prof Linda Bauld said she hoped this Christmas would not be a repeat of last year. Speaking to the BBC Radio Scotland'sGood Morning Scotland, she also said more restrictions could come next week. Prof Bauld said: ""Everybody wants to avoid shutting businesses again and that would be the last resort, but clearly across the country, decision-makers have to look at the menu of options and decide what is proportionate."" She said lockdown was a last resort, but people may be asked to cut back on socialising plans. But she added: ""Isolation, loneliness and separation from loved ones is something we also want to avoid."" Meanwhile, ward 7a at Raigmore Hospital in Inverness has been closed to new admissions after a Covid outbreak. Visiting has also been stopped. NHS bosses said it was not connected to an outbreak on ward 5a of the same hospital last week. Testing will establish if it is the Omicron variant that has closed the wards. Rising case numbers are also putting pressure on other areas. ScotRail has already cancelled 60 train services due to staff shortages as a result of Covid. The operator also dropped their festive Santa Express trips on the Fife Circle line this weekend. Scientists warned on Friday thattwo doses of a Covid vaccineare not enough to stop people catching the Omicron variant - although a third booster dose significantly increases protection to around 75%. Vaccines are still likely to offer good protection against severe Covid that would need hospital treatment.

Donors to release frozen funds for Afghanistan,"About 23 million people are in urgent need of food aid, the World Food Programme says International donors have agreed to transfer $280m (Â£210) from a frozen fund to UN food and health services in Afghanistan, the World Bank says. The country faces a deep humanitarian and economic crisis made worse by the removal of financial support after the Taliban seized power in August. The World Food Programme (WFP) warns that more than half of the population is under threat of acute hunger. Three million children are suffering from malnutrition. The situation is the result of a severe drought, which has ruined much of the wheat crop and sent prices soaring, and an economic crisis accelerated by the decision of Western nations to cut off financial aid after the Taliban takeover. Western powers have refused to recognise the Taliban government officially. The US and other nations have frozen about $10bn of Afghan reserves, while the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund have also halted the country's access to funding. CONTEXT:The struggle to save Afghanistan's starving babies ON THE GROUND:Afghans facing 'hell on earth' as winter looms The WFP estimates that 23 million people require urgent food assistance as winter takes hold in the aid-dependent country, calling it ""the worst humanitarian crisis on Earth"". The money from the World Bank-administered Afghanistan Reconstruction Trust Fund will be transferred to the WFP and to Unicef, both UN agencies. The World Bank said both agencies had ""presence and logistics capacity on the ground"" to deliver services directly to Afghans in line ""with their own policies and procedures"". Unicef will receive $100m to provide essential health services, and the WFP will get $180m.

Fears for Christmas plans amid Omicron concern,"Last year, plans to relax restrictions were scrapped and only two households could meet on Christmas Day People fear having their Christmas plans scuppered for a second year amid concern over the Covid variant Omicron. Wales' coronavirus rules are now beingreviewed weekly instead of every three weeksin response to the new variant. The organiser of a group Christmas Day lunch to combat loneliness said those attending would be ""devastated"" if it was cancelled by new restrictions. About 50 international students in Vale of Glamorgan who are unable to travel home will stay on campus for Christmas. Wales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan has said it istoo early to say if there will be festive restrictions. But the Welsh government has urged people to take lateral flow tests before going shopping, to Christmas parties or visiting others, and extended guidance on mask-wearing to pubs and restaurants, when people are not eating. Last year, plans to relax Covid rules from 23 to 27 December to allow people to meet loved oneswere scrapped with just a few days' notice. Instead, only two households were allowed to meet on Christmas Day only. While there is no official guidance telling people to cancel party plans, health officials atCardiff and Vale University Health Board have urged people not to attend parties, after huge demand at A&E departments. Are Christmas parties being cancelled over Omicron? Stereophonics Cardiff gigs postponed amid Omicron concerns Omicron: How do you detect it? Almuqtada Al-Yasiri will not be spending Christmas with family in Iraq in case new rules are introduced that stop him returning to Wales Almuqtada Al-Yasiri, 17, from Iraq, is one of about 50 students at Atlantic College in Vale of Glamorgan who will spend Christmas on the St Donats campus because of the pandemic. ""My plan was to go back home for this Christmas break,"" he said. ""I really miss my family and I want to spend time with them, but the fact is because of Covid I don't want to risk it. ""If I go back, we might have a lockdown... I have exams coming so I don't want to take that risk."" He said playing piano and the college's peers listening programme were helping keep his spirits up: ""Whenever I'm having a bad time, I just talk with them and they make my day better."" Despite the disappointment he said he was looking forward to Christmas at the college and cooking with his fellow students Atlantic College, based at a 12th Century castle, is home to about 350 16 to 19-year-olds from all over the world Since 2012, councillor Guy Woodham has run an annual Christmas Day lunch in Milford Haven, Pembrokeshire, for about 100 people who would otherwise spend the day alone. He was forced to cancel Christmas Together for the first time last year. This year the event is going ahead but with numbers reduced to 30 and all attending must be double-vaccinated, wear masks when not seated at the table and social distance where possible. He said he had been convinced of the need to go ahead by those who wanted to attend: ""They would actually get in touch or, if I was out and about, would speak to me and say 'please go ahead with it' and tell me their individual stories - that was the real driver. ""It was realising from having those personal conversations that for some people, it was really important to try to do it."" Christmas Together last went ahead in 2019 He said some who had attended in previous years had decided ""despite being lonely they actually would feel safer just staying at home for Christmas"". He is hoping new restrictions will not be introduced that force him to cancel: ""It would be devastating if there was an announcement that we couldn't gather on Christmas Day, but we would have to respect that. Does Wales have its own Covid Plan B? Covid in Wales: What do the stats tell us? NHS Tracker: How is the NHS in your area coping? ""It would be devastating for me, for those involved, and especially those people who made it clear that they don't want to be alone on Christmas Day for very valid personal reasons. ""It's not going to be the same as it has been previously, but hopefully what we do provide will give people some enjoyment on the day, rather than fear and unhappiness of being lonely."" Ammanford Evangelical Church in Carmarthenshire has put on an annual Christmas Day lunch for those who would otherwise be alone or unable to afford a traditional Christmas for more than 20 years. Its in-person event is off for a second Christmas and volunteers will instead be delivering meals cooked by a local pub. Pastor Sammy Davies said: ""People are definitely missing out on spending time together. ""I've actually been surprised how many people have got in touch hoping and expecting it to be in-person again his year... wanting to see each other physically again... so I think that desire is there."" He said people receiving meals would still have some ""human contact"" on Christmas Day, and volunteers had been encouraged to take time to talk on people's doorsteps. He said people had learnt to adapt: ""I think people have become robust and are just dealing with it and grasping opportunities when they come, and being grateful even for the small things that we can do for each other too."" Kimberly Dienes, a lecturer in clinical and health psychology at Swansea University, said it was important people communicated with loved ones about how they want to spend their Christmas in light of the new variant. ""You need to sit down and really talk,"" she said. ""Don't avoid it, have those difficult discussions about what you're going to do."" Kimberly Dienes advised people to ""pay attention to what makes you happy"" when things are unpredictable She said many had found the uncertainty of the past 21 months very difficult, but focusing on acceptance could help. ""We can't predict the futureâ¦ we just have to tolerate ambiguity, to accept uncertainty... focus on things that we can know and the things that we can control,"" she said. ""What you have to do is pay attention to what makes you happy."" Performer andloneliness campaignerCarys Eleri has spent much of the pandemic living with her mother in Upper Tumble, Carmarthenshire. She has planned a small family Christmas and drinks with friends but has come to terms with the fact that the pandemic means plans do not always work out. ""I tried to lower my expectations and just be quite relaxed about this and think of the bigger picture - I'm safe and healthy and my family are healthy,"" she said. Carys Eleri wants everyone to send Christmas cards and phone loved ones to combat loneliness She said she kept her spirits up by taking up running and spending more time in the countryside through the pandemic. She said at the moment people should try not to cancel plans they have made with others. ""Especially if they are alone, they might have been really building up to see you,"" she said. ""I'm a single person, people around you have massive families and if they cancel something their life is busy anyway. ""I might be really looking forward to that interaction, so if you do cancel something, rearrange something quite quickly - just take care of each other, be really mindful of each other's situations."" She also urged everyone to send Christmas cards this year. ""We're used to text messages, emails, social media, sending a couple of Christmas trees emojis on Facebook... but it doesn't give any connection with that person. ""When you see the handwriting that gives so much of that person to you. ""Phone calls and Christmas cards - please do those things.""

"The Monkees star Michael Nesmith dies at 78With the group, the singer and guitarist had a string of hits and starred in a TV sitcom in the 1960s.Entertainment & Arts","Michael Nesmith, singer, guitarist and songwriter with 1960s pop group The Monkees, has died at the age of 78. The quartet enjoyed hits like Daydream Believer and I'm A Believer, and starred in their own popular TV sitcom. Nesmith wrote numerous tunes including Listen To The Band, Sunny Girlfriend and Tapioca Tundra. In a statement, his family said he ""passed away this morning in his home, surrounded by family, peacefully and of natural causes"". Fellow Monkees band memberMicky Dolenz said he was ""heartbroken"",externalat having ""lost a dear friend and partner"". ""I'm so grateful that we could spend the last couple of months together doing what we loved best - singing, laughing, and doing shtick,"" he tweeted. Nesmith (right) and Dolenz (left) took part in a Monkees tour, which ended last month Nesmith and Dolenz had been on tour last month and the group's managerAndrew Sandoval said,external: ""We shared many travels and projects together over the course of 30 years, which culminated in a Monkees farewell tour that wrapped up only a few weeks ago. ""That tour was a true blessing for so many. And in the end I know that Michael was at peace with his legacy which included songwriting, producing, acting, direction and so many innovative ideas and concepts. ""I am positive the brilliance he captured will resonate and offer the love and light towards which he always moved."" Nesmith died from heart failure at his home in Carmel Valley, California, on Friday, a spokesman for record label Rhino told BBC News. The Monkees, with Nesmith (left), charmed viewers with their madcap TV sitcom The Monkees were originally put together for the TV show and found fame with songs that were written for them. But Nesmith, Dolenz, Peter Tork and Brit Davy Jones went on to take full control of their music. ""We were kids with our own taste in music and were happier performing songs we liked - and/or wrote - than songs that were handed to us,""Nesmith told Rolling Stone in 2012,external. The group broke up in 1969, after which Nesmith scored two US chart hits with his First National Band. He also wrote the song Different Drum, which became a major country hit for Linda Ronstadt. After filming a music video for his single Rio in 1977, Nesmith came up with the idea of a TV programme consisting entirely of promo clips. ""Audio records are played on radio, so a video record should be played on video - on television,"" he wrote in his memoir. ""There should be a broadcast component for the music video just like there is for records."" Nesmith called his idea PopClips, and later sold the intellectual property to Time Warner, who used it to develop and launch MTV. Paying tribute, Midge Ure described him as ""an underrated, talented musician, songwriter and video artist"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.
