Scots couple named as Majorca flood victimsAntony and Delia Green were in a taxi which was swallowed up by water at a coastal resort.South Scotland,"Delia and Antony Green had been on holiday in Majorca A couple who lived in Moffat have been named as victims of a flash flood in Majorca. Antony and Delia Green, who moved to Scotland from Atherton in Greater Manchester, were passengers in a taxi when water surged into the area around the coastal resort of Sant Llorenc. Driver Juan Sillero was also killed. At least 12 people are now believed to have died aftertorrential rainstorms hit the area around Sant Llorenc des Cardassar on Tuesday night. The Foreign Office said it was supporting the couple's family. Cars were swept away when the flash flood struck The flood caused significant damage In a statement issued through the Foreign Office, the family said: ""We are deeply shocked by the sudden passing of our parents Delia and Tony Green in the tragic events in Majorca. They were travelling out to Majorca for a two-week holiday when they were caught up in the flooding. ""Delia and Tony were a loving, kind and caring couple. They were at their happiest when they were with their family and friends. ""They recently celebrated 55 years of marriage. Originally from Atherton, Greater Manchester, they retired to Moffat 14 years ago."" The statement added: ""Our thoughts also go out to their taxi driver and his family who are coming to terms with their loss as well."" Mr and Mrs Green, both in their 70s, were found by divers inside the vehicle in the early hours of Wednesday. The taxi was submerged by the flood water in the resort town of S'illot. Friend Emilio Dicerbo said everyone in Moffat, where the couple lived for more than 10 years, would be ""devastated"" by their deaths. The 84-year-old retired ice cream merchant said: ""They were a very friendly, lovely couple. ""Tony would always get out a bit to the shops most mornings and we would have a blether. ""He liked to go have a game of pool, he loved his wee bit of potted plants outside his front door - he did tend his plants, very neat and tidy."" Mr Dicerbo added: ""They were a very friendly couple, just normal. Everyone will be devastated."" More than 80 soldiers joined the rescue and clean-up effort The Reverend Adam Dillon was a Church of Scotland minister in Moffat for 10 years and knew both flood victims. He told the BBC: ""Tony and Delia were always a very lovely couple about the town. ""Tony kept himself to himself but was a strong and silent supporter of Delia who had the bigger friendships in the town."" He added: ""The two of them were very much family folk, they did everything they could for the family. ""Three of their grandchildren were head girls and head boy of Moffat Academy and Delia and Tony were so proud of them. ""It was always a real pleasure and a joy to know the two of them. ""Delia was very much one of the ladies who liked to lunch in Moffat and she had many friendships around the town. I would always remember Delia as someone who would enjoy a cup of coffee and a slice of cake and laughing with her friends. She had a joyous laugh about her. ""Tony would enjoy a blether in the chemist and we would catch up on how the grandchildren were getting on."" The Rev Adam Dillon described the Greens as ""a joyous couple"" Mr Dillon feels they will be missed. He said: ""I think it will be a sad and shocking bit of news for the town and I am sure the community will be very devastated to hear of this untimely death and the circumstances surrounding it. ""This was a time for them to have enjoyed life and I am sure they would have been looking forward to going out and just spending a bit of time in the sun before the winter."" Former Moffat Academy headteacher Jeff Brown said the whole area was stunned at what happened. Former Rector of Moffat Academy, Jeff Brown said the town was in shock He said: ""The reaction of the whole community is a deep feeling of sadness, of a couple that went away on holiday looking for joy and this sadness has overcome them. ""It is a loss of two lovely people to the community - a dark day outside and inside. ""You think of a place that is full of sun and joy and you just can't take in what has happened to this family."" A spokesperson for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: ""We are supporting the family of two British people following their deaths in Spain, and will do all we can to assist them at this deeply difficult time. ""Our staff remain in contact with the Spanish authorities who are responsible for responding to the floods, and are ready to assist any other British people who require our help."" Hundreds of residents have been forced to move to emergency shelters Weather forecasters reported that eight inches of rain fell in the area - 40 miles east of the capital of Palma on the Spanish island - in just four hours. Witnesses described having minutes to find safety as the water levels rose, inundating houses and catching motorists off guard. Floodwaters tore down trees, swept numerous cars and trucks into piles of twisted metal and buried streets under mud. A massive clean-up effort has now begun in the worst-hit eastern towns and villages, where hundreds of residents are returning to clear their badly damaged homes from the flood waters. Soldiers are still searching for three people, including a five year old boy, missing since Monday evening. Police in the worst hit town of Sant LlorenÃ§ say they're dealing with many incidents of looting, and have increased patrols. Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez called news of the flooding ""devastating"" as he visited the area on Wednesday. He said: ""My solidarity and support goes out to the families and friends of victims and all the affected by these tragic floods."" He said the disaster hit towns, which once offered a picture postcard image of the island, will take months to bring back to normality. Hundreds of displaced residents are in emergency shelters, and about 80 soldiers were expected to join more than 100 rescuers who are working in the area.

US military grounds all F-35 jets,"An F-35B launching from the USS Essex The US military has temporarily grounded its entire fleet of F-35 fighter jets in the wake of a crash in South Carolina last month. Inspections are to be carried out on faulty fuel tubes. An official report questioned earlier this year whether the F-35 was ready for combat after dozens of faults were found. The F-35 is the largest and most expensive weapons programme of its type in the world. The programme is expected to last several decades and global sales are projected to be 3,000. The US government's accountability office estimates all costs associated with the project will amount to one trillion dollars. In a statement, the F-35 Joint Program Office said the US and its international partners had suspended flight operations while a fleet-wide inspection of fuel tubes was conducted. ""If suspect fuel tubes are installed, the part will be removed and replaced. If known good fuel tubes are already installed, then those aircraft will be returned to flight status. ""Inspections are expected to be completed within the next 24 to 48 hours."" The aircraft, which uses stealth technology to reduce its visibility to radar, comes in three variants. The crash in South Carolina involved an F-35B, which is able to land vertically and costs around $100m (Â£75m). The pilot in that incident ejected safely but the aircraft was destroyed. This video can not be played F-35 fighter jets prepare to land for first time on a UK carrier The plane, manufactured by Lockheed Martin but including parts made in several other countries, has been sold to a number of nations, including the UK, Japan, Italy, Turkey and South Korea. Why the RAF's new F-35 jets matter The Ministry of Defence in London said the UK had decided to ""pause some F-35 flying as a precautionary measure while we consider the findings of an ongoing enquiry"". But the MOD said F-35 flight trials from the aircraft carrier, HMS Queen Elizabeth, were continuing and the programme remained on schedule to provide UK armed forces with ""a game-changing capability"". By Jonathan Marcus, Defence and Diplomatic Correspondent The temporary suspension of all F-35 flights is an embarrassment given the extraordinary cost of this frequently troubled programme. But the problem has already been identified as faulty fuel tubes. Once these are checked or replaced the aircraft will be back in the air. The  F-35 is only just entering service but it is already the most expensive weapons programme of all time. It will equip the US Air Force and Marine Corps as well as several of Washington's allies. It represents a step-change in capability but the F-35's complexity has inevitably thrown up problems. However there is no going back now. It promises to be the centrepiece of US air power for decades to come. While its costs per aircraft are coming down there are still questions about how many planes the US can afford and whether it should also buy a cheaper, less capable aircraft alongside the F-35. The F-35,first used in combat by Israel earlier this yearto carry out two strikes, is designed for use by the US Air Force, Marine Corps and Navy. It boasts avionics, sensors and communications that allow data to be shared quickly with operational commanders.

Rice 'safely conserved' in gene bank,"Rice being harvested in Northwest Vietnam Scientists say that more than 100 thousand varieties of rice have been safeguarded for the future. Samples in the world's largest rice gene bank in the Philippines are being used to help farmers develop rice crops that can survive drought and flooding. The International Rice Research Institute (IRRI) gene bank has secured permanent funding from theCrop Trust,external. It is part of international efforts to store seeds in gene banks to protect food supplies in a warming world. ""These seeds are miracles - we believe that in this natural diversity of rice you have almost any trait that you would want to look for,"" said Marie Haga, executive director of the international non-profit organisation, the Crop Trust. She said rice is relatively easy to store, and should survive preservation for hundreds of years at low temperatures. The rice contains the genetic diversity that can be used to breed new rice crops capable of withstanding pests and disease as well as flooding and drought. Rice accounts for over 20% of global calorie intake Over 90% of the world's rice is produced and consumed in Asia with six countries (China, India, Indonesia, Bangladesh, Vietnam and Japan) accounting for 80% of the world's production and consumption By 2050, annual rice consumption is estimated to rise from 420 to 525 million tonnes. One recent advance from IRRI, which is based in Los Banos, Philippines, is a strain of rice that can survive areas hit by flooding. ""Scuba rice"" has been introduced in Asia and is now being adapted for growing in Africa. The IRRI gene bank holds wild species of rice from around the world Ruaraidh Sackville-Hamilton, an evolutionary biologist who manages the IRRI genebank, said the work to conserve rice has a proven track record in bringing benefits to the world. ""With this collection safely conserved, we can continue to use it to develop improved rice varieties that farmers can use to respond to the challenges in rice production, and to adapt to the changing tastes and preferences of consumers everywhere,"" he said.

"Seann and Katya 'must do dance of shame'Judge Craig Revel Horwood says beleaguered pair should ""get on with the job"" on the next live show.Entertainment & Arts","Seann and Katya are dancing The Charleston on Saturday night Strictly judge Craig Revel Horwood says contestant Seann Walsh and his professional partner Katya Jones should do ""the dance of shame"" on Saturday. The couple apologisedafter they were caught kissing in public - Walsh had a long-term girlfriend and Jones is married to another dancer on the show. ""My take was keep them in the show, make them do the 'dance of shame,'"" Craig toldITV's Jonathan Ross show,external. ""Get on with the job and show people what you're made of,"" he added. ""It's really important that if this does happen to you, you face up to it and you... as they've done, apologise... and show people, 'Ok, this is what I did, I've been employed to do this job, I'm going to... get on with it and do it well and do it professionally.'"" The rumba is one of Craig's favourite dances Asked aboutthe so-called 'Strictly curse', which claims the BBC One show has caused several relationship break-ups, Craig said ""there has to be something wrong in your relationship"" in the first place for it to go off the rails while on Strictly. Fellow judge Darcey Bussell concurred: ""I danced for over 20 years in the Royal Ballet and I'm still happily married."" Craig said he had wanted to see Seann and Katya do the rumba, which is thought to have been their original dance for this Saturday. ""I wanted to see the rumba, the dance of love, I'm sure everyone wants to see that. That's one of my favourite dances, as well."" Shirley Ballas joined the Strictly panel last year Asked whether they could see any chemistry with Seann and Katya in particular, Craig said: ""There was a mild improvement [in their dance last weekend] from the week before but I would not put that down to a snog at the back of a pub, if that's what you're asking. I would put it down to hard work and having to act through the dance and tell that story."" The judges were askedwhether they felt the public might vote Seann and Katya off the showfollowing the controversy.

Russia probes dramatic aborted Soyuz flight,"This video can not be played The booster failure became apparent about 90 seconds into the October flight Russian officials are investigating the cause of a booster problem that forced a Soyuz rocket capsule to make an emergency landing just after launch. The two crew members, Russian cosmonaut Alexey Ovchinin and American astronaut Nick Hague, are in good health, officials say. They were heading for a six-month mission on the International Space Station when their flight was aborted. Their capsule separated and landed 400km (250 miles) from the launch site. The mission will be attempted again with the same crew ""next spring"", Dmitry Rogozin, the head of Russian space agency Roscosmos, tweeted: Allow Twitter content?

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. The launch appeared to be going smoothly, but some 90 seconds into the flight, the US space agency Nasa reported a problem with the booster rocket between the first and second stages of separating. Live video of the astronauts showed them shaking violently with the vibrations caused by the malfunction. After about 114 seconds of flight, the emergency escape system sprang into action, separating the crew capsule from the rocket. Rescuers dashed to the landing site The capsule then began what Nasa termed a ""ballistic descent"", subjecting the crew to greater G-force - the force imposed on a body by rapid acceleration or deceleration - than during a normal landing. Nasa said the capsule, which later deployed parachutes, took 34 minutes to reach the ground on the Kazakhstan steppe, hundreds of kilometres north-east of the Baikanour cosmodrome launch site. A rescue mission was launched immediately, Nasa and the Russian Roscosmos space agency said. Rescue teams using off-road vehicles and paratroopers deployed in helicopters raced to locate the capsule, near the Kazakh city of Dzhezkazgan. Soon afterwards both space agencies were reporting the astronauts were in good health. Pictures showed the two men seated smiling on a sofa attached to heart rate and blood pressure monitors. Nick Hague (L) and Alexey Ovchinin By Jonathan Amos, BBC science correspondent Soyuz is one of the oldest rocket designs but also one of the safest. The malfunction appeared to occur around what is termed ""staging"", where the ascending vehicle goes through the process of discarding its empty fuel segments. The onboard astronauts were certainly aware that something was not right because they reported feeling weightless when they should have felt pushed back in their seats. The escape systems are tested and ready for exactly this sort of eventuality. It would have been an uncomfortable ride back to Earth, however. The crew would have experienced very sharp accelerations and  decelerations on the return. There is already much discussion about the current state of Russian industry and its ability to maintain the standards of yesteryear. Whatever the outcome of the inquiry, this event will only heighten those concerns and will underline to the US in particular the need to bring online new rocket systems. These vehicles, produced by the Boeing and SpaceX companies, are set to make their debut next year. Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov said no further manned missions would take place ""until we believe that the entire situation guarantees safety"". He rejected suggestions it could harm US relations, saying they recognised it was a ""hi-tech industry linked to risk"", but he added: ""We certainly won't conceal the reasons, it is uncommon for such situations"". Space co-operation is an area which has survived otherwise tense relations between Russia and the US. Nasa has been paying for seats on Soyuz rockets to ferry its astronauts to the International Space Station since the Space Shuttle programme ended in 2011. The crew already on the ISS will not be affected by Thursday's aborted mission, Russia's Tass news agency reported, quoting an unnamed source as saying they have enough supplies. But the three - a German, a Russian and an American - might have to stay on the space station into next year because of the crash, Interfax quoted a source as saying. Roscosmos has ordered the setting up of a state commission to investigate the incident and a criminal investigation is also expected. You might also like to read: What's it like to live on the ISS? Tim Peake special: How to be an astronaut Thursday's incident is thought to be the first launch mishap for a Russian Soyuz booster since a Soyuz mission was aborted in 1983. Then, a rocket malfunctioned shortly before launch, and the crew vehicle was ejected to safety. In recent years, Russia's space programme has faced a number of technical failures - 13 since 2010. Last year, contact was lost with a Soyuz rocket's Fregat upper stage, which was carrying a new weather satellite and 18 secondary satellites. Earlier in 2017, at least nine of a payload of 73 satellites were reported ""dead on arrival or severely degraded"" after separation from their Soyuz-2.1 launch vehicle. In August, a hole appeared in a Soyuz capsule already docked to the ISS which caused a brief loss of air pressure and had to be patched. In this instance,Russia said the hole may have been drilled ""deliberately"". One of the most serious but non-fatal US incidents involved Apollo 13 - a mission to the Moon in 1970. An oxygen tank exploded two days after launch causing a loss of power and leading to the mission being aborted. The crew were able to carry out repairs and return to Earth six days later. While space missions may often encounter technical difficulties, fatalities have been relatively rare: 2003: Seven astronauts died when theColumbiaspace shuttle broke up up on re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere due to a damaged protective tile 1986: Seven astronauts died when theChallengerspace shuttle broke apart after lift-off when seals on a booster rocket failed. 1971: The three-men crew aboardSoyuz 11suffocated as the result of an air leak after undocking from the Salyut 1 space station.

Age boys start puberty 'linked to mothers',"If a mother started puberty early, her son is more likely to, the study suggests The age at which boys begin puberty is linked to when their mothers started having periods, a study suggests. Mothers who started earlier than their peers had sons who had:â¢armpit hair two and a half months earlierâ¢acne and voices breaking two months earlier. Their daughters, meanwhile, developed breasts six months earlier. The study, in theHuman Reproduction,externaljournal, analysed data from nearly 16,000 Danish mothers and children. One of the authors, Dr Nis Brix, of Aarhus University, Denmark, said: ""Whenever a doctor meets a patient with delayed or early onset of puberty, the doctor obtains a family history. ""The relationship between the mother's pubertal age and the son's pubertal age has been taken as common knowledge but now our data from a large study confirms it."" What happens to my body during puberty The health risks of girls maturing early Puberty age 'affects many diseases'' The age boys and girls start puberty has been gradually decreasing around the world. In the UK, it is currently starting about one month earlier every decade. And the current average age is: 11 for girls 12 for boys Children are starting puberty younger Experts put this down to improved health and nutrition in the industrialised world - but studies have also shown a link between obesity and the early onset of puberty. In 2015, a study indicated early or late onset of puberty were linked to a increased risk of: diabetes obesity early menopause cardiovascular disease In girls, an early puberty was defined as starting between eight and 11, while a late puberty started between 15 and 19. In boys, a normal puberty started between nine and 14. An American study in January suggested early puberty in girls was also linked to increased likelihood of mental health problems during adolescence and into adulthood. ""Both genetic and environmental factors undoubtedly influence puberty timing,"" said Dr Christine Wohlfahrt-Veje, a researcher at the University of Copenhagen and one of the lead authors on a study in 2016 looking at puberty and timing. ""Boys and girls inherit from both mothers and fathers - but early pubertal markers, onset of breasts and pubic hair, in girls are less dependent on genetic and hence more on environmental factors such as childhood growth patterns and possibly other environmental exposures.""

Scots couple named as Majorca flood victims,"Delia and Antony Green had been on holiday in Majorca A couple who lived in Moffat have been named as victims of a flash flood in Majorca. Antony and Delia Green, who moved to Scotland from Atherton in Greater Manchester, were passengers in a taxi when water surged into the area around the coastal resort of Sant Llorenc. Driver Juan Sillero was also killed. At least 12 people are now believed to have died aftertorrential rainstorms hit the area around Sant Llorenc des Cardassar on Tuesday night. The Foreign Office said it was supporting the couple's family. Cars were swept away when the flash flood struck The flood caused significant damage In a statement issued through the Foreign Office, the family said: ""We are deeply shocked by the sudden passing of our parents Delia and Tony Green in the tragic events in Majorca. They were travelling out to Majorca for a two-week holiday when they were caught up in the flooding. ""Delia and Tony were a loving, kind and caring couple. They were at their happiest when they were with their family and friends. ""They recently celebrated 55 years of marriage. Originally from Atherton, Greater Manchester, they retired to Moffat 14 years ago."" The statement added: ""Our thoughts also go out to their taxi driver and his family who are coming to terms with their loss as well."" Mr and Mrs Green, both in their 70s, were found by divers inside the vehicle in the early hours of Wednesday. The taxi was submerged by the flood water in the resort town of S'illot. Friend Emilio Dicerbo said everyone in Moffat, where the couple lived for more than 10 years, would be ""devastated"" by their deaths. The 84-year-old retired ice cream merchant said: ""They were a very friendly, lovely couple. ""Tony would always get out a bit to the shops most mornings and we would have a blether. ""He liked to go have a game of pool, he loved his wee bit of potted plants outside his front door - he did tend his plants, very neat and tidy."" Mr Dicerbo added: ""They were a very friendly couple, just normal. Everyone will be devastated."" More than 80 soldiers joined the rescue and clean-up effort The Reverend Adam Dillon was a Church of Scotland minister in Moffat for 10 years and knew both flood victims. He told the BBC: ""Tony and Delia were always a very lovely couple about the town. ""Tony kept himself to himself but was a strong and silent supporter of Delia who had the bigger friendships in the town."" He added: ""The two of them were very much family folk, they did everything they could for the family. ""Three of their grandchildren were head girls and head boy of Moffat Academy and Delia and Tony were so proud of them. ""It was always a real pleasure and a joy to know the two of them. ""Delia was very much one of the ladies who liked to lunch in Moffat and she had many friendships around the town. I would always remember Delia as someone who would enjoy a cup of coffee and a slice of cake and laughing with her friends. She had a joyous laugh about her. ""Tony would enjoy a blether in the chemist and we would catch up on how the grandchildren were getting on."" The Rev Adam Dillon described the Greens as ""a joyous couple"" Mr Dillon feels they will be missed. He said: ""I think it will be a sad and shocking bit of news for the town and I am sure the community will be very devastated to hear of this untimely death and the circumstances surrounding it. ""This was a time for them to have enjoyed life and I am sure they would have been looking forward to going out and just spending a bit of time in the sun before the winter."" Former Moffat Academy headteacher Jeff Brown said the whole area was stunned at what happened. Former Rector of Moffat Academy, Jeff Brown said the town was in shock He said: ""The reaction of the whole community is a deep feeling of sadness, of a couple that went away on holiday looking for joy and this sadness has overcome them. ""It is a loss of two lovely people to the community - a dark day outside and inside. ""You think of a place that is full of sun and joy and you just can't take in what has happened to this family."" A spokesperson for the Foreign and Commonwealth Office said: ""We are supporting the family of two British people following their deaths in Spain, and will do all we can to assist them at this deeply difficult time. ""Our staff remain in contact with the Spanish authorities who are responsible for responding to the floods, and are ready to assist any other British people who require our help."" Hundreds of residents have been forced to move to emergency shelters Weather forecasters reported that eight inches of rain fell in the area - 40 miles east of the capital of Palma on the Spanish island - in just four hours. Witnesses described having minutes to find safety as the water levels rose, inundating houses and catching motorists off guard. Floodwaters tore down trees, swept numerous cars and trucks into piles of twisted metal and buried streets under mud. A massive clean-up effort has now begun in the worst-hit eastern towns and villages, where hundreds of residents are returning to clear their badly damaged homes from the flood waters. Soldiers are still searching for three people, including a five year old boy, missing since Monday evening. Police in the worst hit town of Sant LlorenÃ§ say they're dealing with many incidents of looting, and have increased patrols. Spanish prime minister Pedro Sanchez called news of the flooding ""devastating"" as he visited the area on Wednesday. He said: ""My solidarity and support goes out to the families and friends of victims and all the affected by these tragic floods."" He said the disaster hit towns, which once offered a picture postcard image of the island, will take months to bring back to normality. Hundreds of displaced residents are in emergency shelters, and about 80 soldiers were expected to join more than 100 rescuers who are working in the area.

Car industry condemns 'green' car change,"Motoring groups have condemned the government's decision to cut subsidies for buying greener cars. From 9 November, grants for new plug-in hybrids will be scrapped, while discounts on all-electric cars will be cut from Â£4,500 to Â£3,500. Cash incentives have been offered since 2011 to help promote cleaner cars and meet emissions targets. The RAC and AA motoring groups said the change was a backward step, and the SMMT trade body called it ""astounding"". The Department for Transport (DfT) said,externalthat the Plug-in Car Grant was introduced seven years ago to help the market become established. It was now time to focus support on zero-emission models such as pure electric and hydrogen fuel cell cars, the DfT added. The change comes three months after the government published its Road to Zero strategy, with a proposal to remove cars powered by petrol and diesel cars from UK roads by 2050. Ultra-low emission vehicles currently available for discounts are placed into three categories: Category 1: COâ emissions of less than 50g/km and a zero emission range of at least 70 miles Category 2: COâ emissions of less than 50g/km and a zero emission range between 10 and 69 miles Category 3: COâ emissions of 50 to 75g/km and a zero emission range of at least 20 miles. The government said the cut in the support for Category 1 cars to Â£3,500 reflected recent reductions in the price of electric vehicles. May's Â£106m drive to push green vehicles Electric vehicle sales surge in UK How electric vehicles are moving into the fast lane But motoring groups denounced the changes, saying it would leave the government struggling to meet its emissions reduction targets. Mike Hawes, chief executive of the SMMT motor manufacturers body, said removing the grant for plug-in hybrids was ""totally at odds"" with ambitions to cut CO2 and ""sends yet more confusing signals to car buyers"". Manufacturers, which are having to adjust to tumbling sales of diesel cars, have invested heavily in electric technologies, he said. ""Prematurely removing up-front purchase grants can have a devastating impact on demand - without world-class incentives, government's world-class ambitions will not be delivered,"" Mr Hawes said. The RAC's head of roads policy Nicholas Lyes said the move was ""a major blow to anyone hoping to go green with their next vehicle choice"". ""With up-front costs still a huge barrier for those hoping to switch to an electric vehicle, this move from the government is a big step backwards and is in stark contrast to countries like Norway where generous tax incentives have meant that it has one of the highest ownership levels of ultra-low emission vehicles of anywhere in the world."" And Jack Cousens, head of roads policy for the AA, said: ""The government wants to end the sale of petrol and diesel cars, but scrapping grants for low emission cars may well stall their progress. ""This announcement will simply put more drivers off from buying greener cars.""

"'I considered letting her die in her sleep'A dad on the 16th floor of Grenfell Tower says he wondered if it would be ""kinder"" not to wake his child.UK","Richard Fletcher said the smoke in the hallway was ""not like in the movies - it was pitch black"" A father trapped in Grenfell Tower considered letting his young daughter die in her sleep to spare her seeing the terror of the fire. Richard Fletcher said he thought the ""best thing to do"" might be cuddling up with her and his wife and ""let the smoke and fire take us"". But he sprang ""back into fighting mode"" after being filled with a determination to escape, Mr Fletcher said. The family of three, who lived on the 16th floor, later fled together. On Thursday, Mr Fletcher gave evidence to the inquiry into the Grenfell Tower disaster - which took place on 14 June last year and killed 72 people. The inquiry is now in its 57th day. Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Five things Grenfell firefighters have told us Mr Fletcher, who was 42 at the time of the blaze, said he went to sleep at around 01:00 BST on the night of the fire. Earlier he had seen fire engines arriving at the tower but believed there was a problem with one of the lifts. But minutes later he woke up and saw an ""orange streak"" of fire along the whole length of the building. He woke his wife but his six-year-old daughter continued to sleep as the fire raged. ""Momentarily, I thought the best thing to do was to climb back into bed with our daughter, with my wife and me on either side of our daughter, to cuddle up with her and let the smoke and fire take us,"" said Mr Fletcher. ""By letting her sleep it would mean that the last moments of her life would not involve her screaming in terror. ""I thought it was better and kinder that we let her continue to sleep and die quietly. I did not want her to wake and be in pain, and for her last minutes to be moments of terror."" Mr Fletcher said he opened his blinds and saw fire along the side of the building to the ground But he said he changed his mind around 10 seconds later. ""I thought, 'my daughter is only six years old and she has not seen enough of the world. How unfair would it be for her to go now?'"" ""It pains me even now to think that I was so desperate and felt the situation was so hopeless that such thoughts had crossed my mind."" Mr Fletcher, who works in the transport industry, said his previous experiences - including being at work on the day of the 7 July London bombings - meant he was able to be calm and logical. The family escaped through the pitch black lobby, which was filled with dense smoke, and the stairwell, where the air was mostly clear. Mr Fletcher recalled telling his wife: ""Whatever happens don't let go of me. We get out together or we die together."" The chairman of the inquiry, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, praised Mr Fletcher for his ""great coolness of judgment to get you and your family out of your building"", adding: ""I am very glad you did escape.""

'Everybody breaks down... you are not alone',"Keira Knightley has called for funding for mental health services to be ring-fenced, with more help provided for children and young mothers. The actressrevealed last week she had a mental breakdownat 22 and suffered post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD) as she struggled with her rise to fame. Asked about her comments, Knightly told the BBC: ""People need to know they are not aloneâ¦ everybody breaks down."" Speaking at the London Film Festival, she said it was important to seek help. Knightley was still a teenager in 2002 when she starred in her breakthrough film Bend it Like Beckham, and a year later she was cast in blockbuster Pirates of the Caribbean. Despite her success, criticism bit hard. This video can not be played Keira Knightley on how she has coped with the ""difficulties"" of being a working mother Arriving at the premiere of her new film, Colette, on Thursday evening, Knightley said: ""Everybody, no matter who you are, has a tricky time in your life."" ""There should be help for children with mental health issues, there should be help for young mothers with mental health issues,"" Knightley told Natalie Jamieson, for BBC Radio 5 Live. ""It's something as a society that we really need to look at,"" she said, adding that funding should be ringfenced. Research suggeststhree-quarters of mental health problems are establishedby the age of 24. And analysis last year by the King's Fund health think tank found 40% of mental health trusts in England had seen their budgets cut in 2015-16. The government has announced increases to mental health funding, while bodies dealing with hospital and community health are being required to increase the 13.7% of their budgets currently spent in that area. Knightley spoke about highlighting inspirational women, as in her latest role as French author Sidonie-Gabrielle Colette whose husband Willy took credit for her first four novels. She also said more needed to be done for working mothers, pointing out she was lucky to be able to have her daughter on set. ""I'm in a very lucky place... where I can demand certain things. That is not the case for every single woman,"" she added. Reality Check: What are the targets for mental health?

False widow infestations have been found at numerous locations across the affected schools, both inside and outside the school buildings. Newham Council said it was working with schools to ensure children can still learn while missing lessons. ""âIt is normal to see more spiders at this time of year as they come indoors for warmth,"" it said, adding: ""False widow spiders are native to the UK, and are common in Southern England. ""They are most active at night; during the day they tend to remain within or near their webs.""

No-deal Brexit planning shuts M26 overnight,"This video can not be played ""Something like this that is going to disrupt operations so massively, we need advance notice of this"" says FTA's spokesperson The M26 in Kent is being shut overnight while work is done to see if it can be used as a ""parking lot"" for lorries, in the event of a no-deal Brexit. It will be closed from 2200 BST until 0530 BST until 15 October and again between 19 November and 21 December. Local Tory MP Tom Tugendhat questioned why work began with ""no consultation"" - despite assurances none was planned. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said was part of ""no-deal"" contingency plans but he thought it would not be needed. The M26 is a 10-mile stretch of road connecting the M25 at Sevenoaks and the M20 near West Malling. Sections of the M20 in Kent can be closed under Operation Stack, when lorries are forced to queue because of disruption to rail or ferry journeys. And there have been concerns that a no-deal Brexit could mean lorries getting stuck at the nearby port of Dover because of customs delays. What do Brexit 'no-deal' papers reveal? Brexit: What happens next? Mr Tugendhat, MP for Tonbridge and Malling, which covers the eastern half of the M26, told the Commons he had been assured that works were not planned as recently as last week - only to find out on Wednesday night that they were going ahead. He told MPs: ""It's come to a pretty pass when a member finds out that works have begun on a motorway to turn that motorway into a parking lot without consultation either with the local community or with surrounding members. ""The M26 works started last night. I wrote (to Mr Grayling) in April, asking whether or not this would happen. ""I was assured the works were not planned and only yesterday (Wednesday) was it confirmed to me that Highways England had said that is exactly what was planned, despite having told me the reverse a week earlier."" Mr Grayling replied that he would be happy to meet the MP to discuss the issue, but added: ""I do not expect any of the contingencies that we have in place for a no-deal Brexit to be needed because I'm confident we will reach a sensible agreement."" Operation Stack is currently used on closed sections of the M20 in Kent, where lorries park while waiting to cross the English Channel when traffic is disrupted. A new strategy, Operation Brock, due to start in early 2019, plans to use a contraflow to keep the roads open when problems arise. Paul Carter, the Conservative leader of Kent County Council, said turning sections of the M26 into a lorry park would be complex and cause ""significant problems"". ""It is possible to close part of the M26 but my mantra is that we must keep our roads open to the public no matter what is thrown at us,"" he told Kent Online. Highways England said traffic was relatively light on the M26 overnight and drivers were being informed of alternative routes during the closure period. ""As part of wider resilience planning, Highways England has been asked by the Department for Transport to develop plans to utilise the M26 to hold heavy goods vehicles, should further capacity be required in the future,"" a spokesman added. ""We will be undertaking site surveys on the M26 during October leading to the installation of two gates in the central reservation to support the safe management of freight in the future, if needed.""

Minister won't say if she backs PM's EU plan,"This video can not be played Esther McVey is asked whether she backs Theresa May's Brexit plan Esther McVey has declined to back Theresa May's Brexit plans, saying she did not want to add to ""speculation"". The work and pensions secretary said she was ""fully, 100% behind the prime minister"" without endorsing her proposal for future trade with the EU. Cabinet ministers expressed concern about potential compromises with the EU at a meeting at No 10 on Thursday. The BBC understands concerns centred around plans to ensure no hard border between Ireland and Northern Ireland. The UK and the EU both want to avoid a ""hard border"" - physical checks or infrastructure between Northern Ireland and Ireland - but cannot agree how. DUP threatens 'serious action' over Brexit Brexit negotiators working 'day and night' New Brexit checks 'needed on GB-NI goods' The EU has proposed a backstop that would mean Northern Ireland staying in the EU customs union - something the UK says would create a border down the Irish Sea. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said it was understood that the EU was prepared to accept the idea of the whole of the UK remaining in the customs union if no trade deal can be done by the end of 2020, the so-called ""transition period"". But the EU would not accept the UK's bid to put an end date on it -  many Brexiteers argue an open-ended arrangement is unacceptable. It is understood that cabinet ministers Liam Fox, Michael Gove, Dominic Raab and Jeremy Hunt expressed concerns. This video can not be played Helen Grant on the DUP: ""I think they are bluffing."" Meanwhile Arlene Foster, leader of the DUP, which supports Mrs May's government on key votes,has said Theresa May cannot in good conscience recommend a Brexit deal that places a trade barrieron businesses moving goods from one part of the UK to another. The DUP has threatened to withdraw its support for the government if it is not happy with the final Brexit deal. But Tory MP Helen Grant, a Tory vice chairwoman, told the BBC's Politics Live: ""I think they're bluffing."" Please upgrade your browser The UK and the EU have yet to strike a deal on how Brexit will work, with less than six months to go before the UK leaves on 29 March. Mrs May says she is working for a deal and has urged MPs to ""put the national interest first"" and support it. Earlier, asked several times if she backed Mrs May's approach, set out in a White Paper in July, Ms McVey told the BBC: ""I am completely supportive of the prime minister as she well knows, what I won't do even for you right now is speculate."" Brexit: All you need to know At-a-glance: The UK's four Brexit options The prime minister says her plan (often called the Chequers plan because that is the name of the country residence where it was agreed) for the UK and EU to share a ""common rulebook"" for goods, but not services, is the only credible way to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. But it is opposed by some within her own party who argue it would compromise the UK's sovereignty - former foreign secretary Boris Johnson has led criticism and Brexiteers have backed a ""Canada plus plus"" deal instead, modelled on Canada's free trade deal with the EU. Sir Ivan Rogers, the UK's former ambassador to the European Union, dismissed both options in a speech in Cambridge, saying the chances of the EU agreeing to either was ""precisely zero"" and that there had been ""culpable naivety"" in the negotiations. Meanwhile the EU says its negotiators are working ""day and night"" to try to reach an agreement ahead of Wednesday's summit. The UK is expected to come up with new proposals as an alternative to the ""backstop"" put forward by the EU - which the government has rejected, saying it would threaten the integrity of the UK. Mrs May relies on DUP support in key votes because the Conservatives do not have a majority in the House of Commons. On Wednesday it was revealed that the DUP was prepared to vote against the Budget on 29 October - which could threaten the future of the government - if there are any new barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK as a result of Brexit. And in a vote on the Agriculture Bill, it did not back the Conservatives in what DUP sources said was a ""warning shot"" for the government. On Wednesday, EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier said there would have to be checks on goods travelling to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK, because they would effectively be arriving in the EU's single market if there was no hard border with the Republic of Ireland. ""I understand why such procedures are politically sensitive,"" he said, but added ""Brexit was not our choice, it is the choice of the UK."" The EU and UK have agreed that these checks ""cannot be performed at the border"" and the EU proposes to carry them out ""in the least intrusive way possible"", he said. Former Prime Minister Sir John Major, meanwhile, has said he has ""great sympathy"" for Mrs May,telling the BBC's Political Thinking podcastthat ""the way she's being treated by some of her colleagues is absolutely outrageous"". He hit out the ""not so subliminal bullying"" by Tories opposing her strategy in the middle of negotiations and also criticised International Development Secretary Penny Mordaunt, who declined to give the PM's plan her explicit backing when asked earlier this week. ""If people are sitting in cabinet they either support the government's policy or they don't sit in cabinet,"" Sir John said.

'I considered letting her die in her sleep',"Richard Fletcher said the smoke in the hallway was ""not like in the movies - it was pitch black"" A father trapped in Grenfell Tower considered letting his young daughter die in her sleep to spare her seeing the terror of the fire. Richard Fletcher said he thought the ""best thing to do"" might be cuddling up with her and his wife and ""let the smoke and fire take us"". But he sprang ""back into fighting mode"" after being filled with a determination to escape, Mr Fletcher said. The family of three, who lived on the 16th floor, later fled together. On Thursday, Mr Fletcher gave evidence to the inquiry into the Grenfell Tower disaster - which took place on 14 June last year and killed 72 people. The inquiry is now in its 57th day. Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Five things Grenfell firefighters have told us Mr Fletcher, who was 42 at the time of the blaze, said he went to sleep at around 01:00 BST on the night of the fire. Earlier he had seen fire engines arriving at the tower but believed there was a problem with one of the lifts. But minutes later he woke up and saw an ""orange streak"" of fire along the whole length of the building. He woke his wife but his six-year-old daughter continued to sleep as the fire raged. ""Momentarily, I thought the best thing to do was to climb back into bed with our daughter, with my wife and me on either side of our daughter, to cuddle up with her and let the smoke and fire take us,"" said Mr Fletcher. ""By letting her sleep it would mean that the last moments of her life would not involve her screaming in terror. ""I thought it was better and kinder that we let her continue to sleep and die quietly. I did not want her to wake and be in pain, and for her last minutes to be moments of terror."" Mr Fletcher said he opened his blinds and saw fire along the side of the building to the ground But he said he changed his mind around 10 seconds later. ""I thought, 'my daughter is only six years old and she has not seen enough of the world. How unfair would it be for her to go now?'"" ""It pains me even now to think that I was so desperate and felt the situation was so hopeless that such thoughts had crossed my mind."" Mr Fletcher, who works in the transport industry, said his previous experiences - including being at work on the day of the 7 July London bombings - meant he was able to be calm and logical. The family escaped through the pitch black lobby, which was filled with dense smoke, and the stairwell, where the air was mostly clear. Mr Fletcher recalled telling his wife: ""Whatever happens don't let go of me. We get out together or we die together."" The chairman of the inquiry, Sir Martin Moore-Bick, praised Mr Fletcher for his ""great coolness of judgment to get you and your family out of your building"", adding: ""I am very glad you did escape."" The inquiry was adjourned until Monday. Grenfell Tower fire: Who were the victims? Five things Grenfell firefighters have told us Grenfell Inquiry: What is happening?

Coast collapses putting 300 jobs at risk,"Women's fashion retailer Coast has gone into administration, putting 300 jobs at risk, in a sign of continuing pain on the High Street. The collapse means the immediate closure of its 24 stores at locations including Oxford Street in London. Karen Millen has bought some parts of Coast, whose website and department store concessions will keep trading. About 600 staff will transfer to Karen Millen, but the remaining 300 workers now face an uncertain future. Coast was owned by Aurora Fashions, which also owns retailers Oasis and Warehouse. Aurora is controlled by Icelandic bank Kaupthing, which also owns Karen Millen. The retailer had numerous concessions in House of Fraser and was owed millions after the department store chain itself collapsed earlier this year. French Connection says it could be sold Ashley sacks House of Fraser management Mike Denny, joint administrator and PwC director, said Coast had been facing financial difficulties due to its concessions business, as well as structural challenges in the retail sector and lower demand for occasion wear. ""This sale puts the ongoing business on a firmer financial footing. Karen Millen will be working with the existing management team to continue to grow and develop the new business,"" he said. ""Regrettably, other parts of the business including 24 retail stores were not included in the transaction. We will make every effort to help those employees in parts of the business that were not included in the sale and will support those affected at this difficult time by liaising with the Redundancy Payments Service and Job Centre Plus."" Karen Millen said it was confident of being able to boost sales of Coast's ""premium womenswear"" ranges. Beth Butterwick, its chief executive, said: ""With its beautiful fabrics, stunning colours and signature designs, Coast is a much-loved fashion brand that has dressed women for all occasions since 1996. ""Our expertise and infrastructure puts us in a unique position to create a lean and profitable business, ensuring it remains a thriving destination in department stores and online."" Coast's concessions in department stores including Debenhams and John Lewis will continue to trade and gift vouchers will be honoured online. Uncollected click and collect orders will be refunded in due course. The collapse of another retailer follows the demise this year of chains including Maplin and Toys R Us. New Look, Homebase and casual dining chains have also had to close dozens of outlets in a bid to remain profitable. This week,the owner of the Patisserie Valerie cafe chain saidit needed an ""an immediate injection of capital"" to continue trading in its current form. The company said it had uncovered ""significant, and potentially fraudulent, accounting irregularities"".

Judge dismisses one Weinstein charge,"Mr Weinstein has denied having non-consensual sex A judge in New York has dismissed one of the six sex assault charges against Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein. Prosecutors said actress Lucia Evans had given a witness a different version of the alleged sex assault from the one she had given them. Ms Evans has told US media that Mr Weinstein forced her to perform oral sex on him in 2004. Five charges involving alleged sex assaults on two women remain. Mr Weinstein has denied all the charges. Mr Weinstein's lawyer, Benjamin Brafman, said he would seek to have the remaining charges dismissed as well. How the Harvey Weinstein scandal unfolded Where the Weinstein case goes from here Mr Brafman also said he would investigate what he said had been ""perjury"" before the grand jury which indicted Mr Weinstein, as well as the conduct of a New York police officer who had worked on the case. After the hearing, the Manhattan district attorney's office released a letter it had sent to Mr Brafman last month which said that a witness had told prosecutors that she had heard a version of the alleged assault from Ms Evans that was different from the account Ms Evans had originally given prosecutors. The witness had given the different account to a New York police officer who had failed to tell prosecutors, the letter added. Ms Evans's lawyer, Carrie Goldberg, said her client's account of events had been accurate. ""I want to be very clear that prosecutors' decision to abandon my client's claims does not invalidate the truth of her claims,"" Ms Goldberg said. Mr Weinstein has been accused of sexual misconduct by more than 70 women. The accusations against him gave rise to the #MeToo movement, which has seen hundreds of women accusing high-profile men in business, government and entertainment of sexual abuse and harassment. He has agreed to wear a GPS tracker and to surrender his passport. He also faces additional investigations in Los Angeles and London, and by the US federal government. The 66-year-old, who has been on $1m (Â£750,000) bail since his arrest in May, has denied having non-consensual sex, his lawyers have previously said.

Medical cannabis prescribed from November,"Doctors will be able to prescribe medicinal cannabis after a change in the law Doctors will be able to prescribe cannabis products to patients from 1 November, the Home Secretary Sajid Javid says. The new regulations apply to England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland. Mr Javid decided to relax the ruleson when cannabis products could be given to patients after a review into medicinal cannabis earlier this year. This followed an outcry over Alfie Dingley and Billy Caldwell being denied access to cannabis oil. The parents of the two young epilepsy sufferers said the product helped to control their seizures. Alfie's mother, Hannah Deacon, welcomed the move, saying: ""We urge the medical world to get behind these reforms so they can help the tens of thousands of people who are in urgent need of help. Billy Caldwell and Alfie Dingley were granted licences to allow them access to cannabis oil ""I have personally seen how my son's life has changed due to the medical cannabis he is now prescribed."" Professor Mike Barnes, the medical cannabis expert who secured the first long-term licence for its use for Alfie, encouraged doctors to embrace the changes to the laws on prescribing medicinal cannabis. An initial review by chief medical officer Dame Sally Davies concluded there was evidence medicinal cannabis has therapeutic benefits. The Advisory Council on the Misuse of Drugs (ACMD), which carried out the second part of the review, then said doctors should be able to prescribe medicinal cannabis provided products met safety standards. It recommended cannabis-derived medicinal products should be placed in schedule two of the Misuse of Drugs Regulations 2001.

Astronauts escape malfunctioning rocket,"This video can not be played The booster failure became apparent about 90 seconds into the October flight A US astronaut and a Russian cosmonaut were forced to make an emergency landing after their Russian Soyuz rocket malfunctioned en route to the International Space Station (ISS). Shortly after taking off from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, Nick Hague and Alexey Ovchinin reported a problem with the rocket's booster. The men were forced into a ""ballistic descent"", with their capsule landing a few hundred miles north of Baikonur. They have been picked up by rescuers. ""The search and recovery teams have reached the Soyuz spacecraft landing site and report that the two crew members... are in good condition and are out of the capsule,"" US space agency Nasa said. Russia said it was suspending any further manned flights, and an investigation into what went wrong had begun. The launch appeared to be going smoothly, but some 90 seconds later Nasa, on its livestream, reported that a problem seemed to have occurred with the booster rocket between the first and second stages of separation. Footage from inside the capsule showed the two men being shaken around at the moment that the fault happened. Shortly afterwards, Nasa said they were making a ""ballistic descent"" meaning their capsule descended at a much sharper angle than normal and would have been subjected to greater G-force - the force imposed on a body by rapid acceleration. The capsule separated from the failing rocket and later deployed parachutes to slow its descent. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

By Jonathan Amos, BBC science correspondent Soyuz is one of the oldest rocket designs but also one of the safest. The malfunction appeared to occur around what is termed ""staging"", where the ascending vehicle goes through the process of discarding its empty fuel segments. The onboard astronauts were certainly aware that something was not right because they reported feeling weightless when they should have felt pushed back in their seats. The escape systems are tested and ready for exactly this sort of eventuality. It would have been an uncomfortable ride back to Earth, however. The crew would have experienced very sharp accelerations and  decelerations on the return. There is already much discussion about the current state of Russian industry and its ability to maintain the standards of yesteryear. Whatever the outcome of the inquiry, this event will only heighten those concerns and will underline to the US in particular the need to bring online new rocket systems. These vehicles, produced by the Boeing and SpaceX companies, are set to make their debut next year. They seem to have been unharmed by the experience. Search and rescue teams were quickly on the scene, 500km (310 miles) north-east of Baikonur, near the Kazakh city of Dzhezkazgan. They reported that Mr Hague and Mr Ovchinin were alive and well and the Russian civilian space agency, Roscosmos, later issued photos of them having their hearts and blood pressure monitored. ""The emergency rescue system worked, the vessel was able to land in Kazakhstan... the crew are alive,"" Roscosmos tweeted. Nasa described them as being in good condition. They reportedly did not need medical treatment. Nasa added that the two men were being taken to the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre outside Moscow,external, and it was ""monitoring the situation carefully"".

Tim Peake special: How to be an astronaut Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov said no further manned missions would take place ""until we believe that the entire situation guarantees safety"". He rejected suggestions it could harm US relations, saying they recognised it was a ""hi-tech industry linked to risk"", but he added: ""We certainly won't conceal the reasons, it is uncommon for such situations"". Space co-operation is an area which has survived otherwise tense relations between Russia and the US. Nasa has been paying for seats on Soyuz rockets to ferry its astronauts to the International Space Station since the Space Shuttle programme ended in 2011. The crew already on the ISS will not be affected by Thursday's aborted mission, Russia's Tass news agency reported, quoting an unnamed source as saying they have enough supplies. Thursday's incident is thought to be the first launch mishap for a Russian Soyuz booster since a Soyuz mission was aborted in 1983. A rocket malfunctioned shortly before launch, and the crew vehicle was ejected to safety. In recent years, Russia's space programme has faced a number of technical failures - 13 since 2010. Last year, contact was lost with a Soyuz rocket's Fregat upper stage, which was carrying a new weather satellite and 18 secondary satellites. Earlier in 2017, at least nine of a payload of 73 satellites were reported ""dead on arrival or severely degraded"" after separation from their Soyuz-2.1 launch vehicle. In August, a hole appeared in a Soyuz capsule already docked to the ISS which caused a brief loss of air pressure and had to be patched. In this instance,Russia said the hole may have been drilled ""deliberately"". One of the most serious but non-fatal US incidents involved Apollo 13 - a mission to the Moon in 1970. An oxygen tank exploded two days after launch causing a loss of power and leading to the mission being aborted. The crew were able to carry out repairs and return to Earth six days later. While space missions may often encounter technical difficulties, fatalities have been relatively rare: 2003: Seven astronauts died when theColumbiaspace shuttle broke up up on re-entry into the Earth's atmosphere due to a damaged protective tile 1986: Seven astronauts died when theChallengerspace shuttle broke apart after lift off because of faulty seals on the booster rockets 1971: The three-men crew aboardSoyuz 11suffocated as the result of an air leak after undocking from the Salyut 1 space station. They were found dead inside the capsule after landing 1967: Crash ofSoyuz 1, with one cosmonaut killed as the spacecraft's parachute, intended to slow down descent, became tangled on re-entry 1967: Three-man crew ofApollo 1died as their command module caught fire on the launch pad Spacecraft hole could be 'deliberate' Back on Earth after five months in space Next European ISS commander launches New fire erupts in Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Patisserie Valerie on brink of collapse,"The owner of Patisserie Valerie has said the cafe chain needs ""an immediate injection of capital"" to continue trading in its current form. The stark statement to investors comes after the firm uncovered ""significant, and potentially fraudulent, accounting irregularities"". It also belatedly discovered HMRC filed a winding-up petition against one of its principal subsidiaries in September and is seeking Â£1.14m in taxes. The firm has more than 2,500 staff. The company announced earlier this week that finance director Chris Marsh had been suspended. Staff told the BBC that they have not been told anything by the company at all, and even the store managers are in the dark. ""I suppose it's because there's nothing wrong, but will we get paid our next month's salary in three weeks' time?"" said an employee, who asked not to be named. A long-term employee, who has worked for the company under both its current owner Risk Capital Partners and the previous owners, the Scalzo family, told the BBC that she only found out about Patisserie Valerie's problems through media coverage. ""No one has told us anything. I asked my manager and they don't know anything either,"" she said. It has five brands: Patisserie Valerie, Druckers - Vienna Patisserie, Philpotts, Baker & Spice and Flour Power City. Now, there are 206 stores across the chain and more than 2,500 staff as of May 2018. It was floated on the AIM stock market, for smaller companies, in 2014. The first Patisserie Valerie cafÃ© was opened on Frith Street in London's Soho district in 1926. In 1987 the Scalzo family bought the Old Compton Street store and ran the business. In 2006, Luke Johnson's Risk Capital Partners bought a majority stake when it had eight stores. In its statement on Thursday,external, the firm said that over the past 24 hours it had ""undertaken further investigation into the financial status of the company"". The board found ""a material shortfall between the reported financial status and the current financial status of the business"". ""Without an immediate injection of capital, the directors are of the view that there is no scope for the business to continue trading in its current form,"" it continued. The company said its ""professional advisers are assessing all options available to the business to keep it trading and will update the market in due course"". Simon Jack, business editor The news that Patisserie Valerie - a business worth Â£440m on Monday - is no longer a going concern without a capital injection is absolutely jaw-dropping. The stores stay open for now. But with no cash, that cannot last, as suppliers will simply stop delivering. The future of the company, its 206 stores and its 2,500 employees is very much in the balance. Read Simon's analysis in full here In its most recent results statement in May,external, the firm said it had cash reserves of Â£28.8m. Shares in the company, which is 37%-owned by entrepreneur Luke Johnson, were suspended before trading on Wednesday. Also on Wednesdaythe firm announced that its board had become aware of an HMRC winding-up petition,externalagainst its principal subsidiary Stonebeach, with the tax body seeking a payment of Â£1.14m. One of the Stonebeach directors is Patisserie Valerie's suspended finance director Chris Marsh, according todocuments filed with Companies House,external. Luke Johnson, who invested in Patisserie Valerie in 2006, is a serial entrepreneur who is best known for taking control of Pizza Express in 1993 before selling out in 1999. In 2001 he co-founded Risk Capital Partners, which owns stakes in companies including Majestic Bingo and swimming goods firm Zoggs.

Kanye: 'Trump made me feel like Superman',"This video can not be played Kanye: MAGA hat ""made me feel like Superman"" Kanye West launched into an expletive-filled rant as he lavished praise on US President Donald Trump at an event in the Oval Office. Wearing a Make America Great Again hat ""made me feel like Superman"", he said. West had been invited to the White House for lunch to discuss prison reform and other issues. At the end of the 10-minute monologue, during which Mr Trump nodded in approval, the president said: ""That was quite something."" West replied: ""It was from the soul. I just channelled it."" ""I love this guy right here,"" West said, walking behind the desk to hug the seated president, who said: ""That's really nice."" Allow Twitter content?

During his monologue that ranged from prison reform to manufacturing, politics and the universe, West said: ""They tried to scare me, my friends to not wear this hat, but this hat, it gives me power in a way. ""You know, my dad and my mum separated, so I didn't have a lot of male energy in my home."" He continued: ""I love Hillary, I love everyone, right. ""But the campaign, I'm With Her, just didn't make me feel as a guy that didn't get to see my dad all the time, like a guy that could play catch with his son."" Addressing Mr Trump, he added: ""There was something about when I put this hat on it made me feel like Superman. ""You made a Superman - that's my favourite superhero - you made a Superman cape for me."" West denied that all black Americans were Democrats. ""People expect that if you're black, you have to be Democrat,"" he said. ""If he [President Trump] don't look good, we don't look good,"" he said at one point, attacking the ""liberals"" on the Saturday Night Live show who have criticised his support for Mr Trump. Mr Trump won 8% of the African-American vote in 2016. Mr Trump was asked by a journalist if West could be a future presidential candidate, and the president replied: ""Could very well be."" West told reporters: ""Let's stop worrying about the future, all we have is today. ""Trump is on his hero's journey right now."" He added: ""You might not have expected a crazy [expletive] like Kanye running up to support."" West told the assembled group an earlier diagnosis of bipolar disorder was incorrect, according to a neuro-psychologist he saw. ""He said that I actually wasn't bipolar, I had sleep deprivation, which could cause dementia 10 to 20 years from now where I wouldn't even remember my son's name,"" he said. West has previously revealed he received treatment for bipolar disorder, and has made reference to it in his music. ""Sometimes people say, 'This kid has ADD [Attention Deficit Disorder], this kid has ADD.'"" ""You don't have ADD, school is boring. It is boring, it's not as exciting as this,"" he said gesturing towards his mobile phone. At one point he typed in his mobile phone password, in full view of the assembled news cameras - a fact which did not go unnoticed by the world. Allow Twitter content?

West was ostensibly at the lunch in part to discuss crime in Chicago, his hometown. He asked Mr Trump to pardon the leader of a notorious Chicago street gang, and called on the president to build ""Trump factories"" in Chicago. At one point he did disagree with Mr Trump, saying that he considers police ""stop-and-frisk"" to be unhelpful. Mr Trump has called upon Chicago police to institute the practice, which allows random searches. ""I didn't mean to put you on blast like that, bro,"" West told Mr Trump. ""I like the North Korea,"" West said. ""You stopped the war,"" he told Mr Trump. ""Day One, solved one of his biggest problems. We solved one of the biggest problems."" West visited Mr Trump at his eponymous Manhattan skyscraper in 2016, a month after he won the election, but this was the rapper's first trip to the White House. West's wife, reality TV star Kim Kardashian, has made two visits to the White House.

Universal credit 'will make some worse off',"This video can not be played Esther McVey on universal credit: Some will be worse off Some people will be worse off under universal credit - but they can take on more work to increase their income, the minister in charge says. Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey defended the new benefit system amidreports 3.2 million households,externalwill lose more than Â£2,000 year. She told the BBC some people would lose out because the government had made ""tough"" spending decisions in 2015. But she insisted the most vulnerable would be protected. Challenged over one estimate that three million people would be about Â£1,800 a year worse-off, Ms McVey told the BBC: ""I have said we made tough decisions and some people will be worse off."" Earlier, the former Conservative prime minister Sir John Majorwarned universal credit was being rushed in without enough funding. Universal credit is a new benefit for working-age people that consolidates into one monthly payment six separate benefits: income support income-based jobseeker's allowance income-related employment and support allowance housing benefit child tax credit working tax credit Read more:What is universal credit? Currently being phased in for different types of claimant across the UK, it is aimed at making the benefits system simpler and more flexible so people who are able to work are rewarded for doing so. Universal credit has been criticised for running over budget and causing delays to people's payments, but the plan is to move all existing benefit claimants on to it next year. Ms McVey is reported to have privately told cabinet colleagues that many claimants could lose as much as Â£200 a month as a result of the switch to universal credit. Major: Universal credit like 80s poll tax McDonnell: Universal credit has to go Benefit plan 'risks social unrest' - Brown Asked about those reports, she told BBC News: ""Some people could be worse off on this benefit. But a thousand people every day since 2010 have gone in to work."" Asked about those who would lose out, she said: ""If those people can work, what they will be losing is benefits, but what they have got now is work. Work will be paying. Their wage will be increasing."" This video can not be played PMQs: May quizzed by Labour MP on universal credit cuts Ms McVey also hit back at criticism from Sir John Major, who has warned that universal credit could hurt current prime minister Theresa May in the same way the poll tax hurt the then prime minister Margaret Thatcher in 1989 and 1990. Ms McVey said she ""knows more about universal credit"" than the former Conservative prime minister. But the government is facing growing calls from Conservative MPs - including the architect of the system Iain Duncan Smith and other backbenchers facing complaints from constituents - to scrap a promised income tax cut and instead pump more more money into universal credit.

Ms McVey claimed it was working ""much better than the old system"" which ""kept people out of work"" and she said the government was putting Â£3.1bn into helping people affected by the transition to the new system. But the Resolution Foundation think tank said less than 20% of affected families are expected to receive support from the government to change to the new system. People whose circumstances change, who make a brand new claim, or who come off benefits and then go back on to them, will not be protected. Jeremy Corbyn: Nobody would be worse off under Labour plans Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Theresa May said ""people who are moved on to universal credit... will not see any reduction"" in their benefits. Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood said: ""Now that Esther McVey has admitted that people will be worse off under universal credit, this Conservative government has no excuse for pushing ahead with their shameful programme. ""This exposes Number 10's claim this week that no family will receive less money under universal credit as fiction."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the universal credit system ""has to change very, very rapidly"" and that Labour will be proposing ""a more comprehensive system"" in which nobody would be ""worse off"". Speaking in Bristol, Mr Corbyn said that Labour would ""immediately stop the process"" of the nationwide rollout and would maintain ""existing levels of benefit immediately"". The switch to universal credit will create some winners, the Resolution Foundation says, with 1.1 million households an average of Â£53-a-week better off. But, overall, working families will be worse off than under the current benefit system, with the biggest losers likely to be people with children who are currently in receipt of tax credits, analysts say.

Benefit plan 'risks social unrest' - Brown,"This video can not be played Gordon Brown demands a ""Budget for children"" The rollout of universal credit should be put on hold, Gordon Brown has said, warning the ""cruel and vindictive"" system is exacerbating child poverty. Unless plans to extend the benefit across the UK were paused or abandoned, the ex-prime minister said, it could lead to major social unrest next year. In a speech in Edinburgh, he also urged action in this month's Budget to boost child benefit and tax credits. Theresa May says low-income families will be protected during the rollout. Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions, the prime minister said the expansion of Universal Credit to an extra two million people next July would initially be done on a ""small-scale basis to ensure we get that right"". She appeared to guarantee that those involved, likely to include one million working families and 750,000 people unable to work because of illness or disability, would not see any reduction in their monthly income. Universal credit is a new benefit for working-age people that consolidates into one monthly payment six benefits: income support income-based jobseeker's allowance income-related employment and support allowance housing benefit child tax credit working tax credit Read more:What is universal credit? It was designed to make claiming benefits simpler and low-paid work more financially rewarding but its implementation, which has been phased in to different groups and regions, remains hugely controversial. The process of making universal credit available to all claimant groups across the UK has been delayed several times but is now due to go ahead in the summer. Mr Brown said universal credit can no longer achieve its stated objectives because of the Â£3bn cut to its budget while the problems people are having in claiming support have had a devastating impact on their lives and led to a massive increase in the use of food banks. He cited research by the Resolution Foundation, which suggests 3.2 million working families are set to lose an average of Â£48 a week as a result, equivalent to about Â£2,400 a year. This, combined with other welfare changes, such as the freeze in child benefits and tax credits since 2015, the two-child limit on child tax credit claims and scrapping the family element of child tax credits, he said, means the number of families with children living in poverty is set to rise to 5.2 million by 2020. This video can not be played Being in work, or in-work poverty... ""Claimants feel more powerless than ever, waiting weeks for money, forcing rent arrears and pushing families into the hands of loan sharks,"" the former Labour leader said. ""So I am calling today for the government... to end this harsh, harmful and hated experiment. We need an urgent review... and we must hear the voices of those who know what it is like to have help cut short."" Ministers, he said, are ""deeply worried"" about the potential chaos that extending universal credit further could bring - saying ""a return to poll-tax-style chaos in a summer of discontent lies ahead"". The Labour leadership has called for universal credit to be scrapped and Mr Brown said there may be no alternative unless it can be made ""fit for purpose"". McDonnell: Universal credit has to go He will also urge Chancellor Philip Hammond to use his Budget on 29 October to end the child benefit freeze and restore child tax credits to ""halt the rising epidemic of child poverty"". Work and Pensions Secretary Esther McVey has vowed to press on with the rollout of universal credit, which she said had helped contribute to record employment levels. Speaking at the Tory conference last month, she said Labour ""hated"" the benefit model so much because it ""ensures that work always pays"" and the system put in place by Mr Brown during his decade as chancellor ""stifled opportunities"" through punitive tax rates. She promised job centres would be working with Citizens Advice to ensure the most vulnerable access to the money to which they were entitled and budgeting advice.

Ms McVey is reported to have privately told cabinet colleagues that many claimants could lose as much as Â£200 a month as a result of the switch to universal credit. Major: Universal credit like 80s poll tax McDonnell: Universal credit has to go Benefit plan 'risks social unrest' - Brown Asked about those reports, she told BBC News: ""Some people could be worse off on this benefit. But a thousand people every day since 2010 have gone in to work."" Asked about those who would lose out, she said: ""If those people can work, what they will be losing is benefits, but what they have got now is work. Work will be paying. Their wage will be increasing."" This video can not be played PMQs: May quizzed by Labour MP on universal credit cuts Ms McVey also hit back at criticism from Sir John Major, who has warned that universal credit could hurt current prime minister Theresa May in the same way the poll tax hurt the then prime minister Margaret Thatcher in 1989 and 1990. Ms McVey said she ""knows more about universal credit"" than the former Conservative prime minister. But the government is facing growing calls from Conservative MPs - including the architect of the system Iain Duncan Smith and other backbenchers facing complaints from constituents - to scrap a promised income tax cut and instead pump more more money into universal credit.

Ms McVey claimed it was working ""much better than the old system"" which ""kept people out of work"" and she said the government was putting Â£3.1bn into helping people affected by the transition to the new system. But the Resolution Foundation think tank said less than 20% of affected families are expected to receive support from the government to change to the new system. People whose circumstances change, who make a brand new claim, or who come off benefits and then go back on to them, will not be protected. Jeremy Corbyn: Nobody would be worse off under Labour plans Speaking at Prime Minister's Questions on Wednesday, Theresa May said ""people who are moved on to universal credit... will not see any reduction"" in their benefits. Labour's shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood said: ""Now that Esther McVey has admitted that people will be worse off under universal credit, this Conservative government has no excuse for pushing ahead with their shameful programme. ""This exposes Number 10's claim this week that no family will receive less money under universal credit as fiction."" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said the universal credit system ""has to change very, very rapidly"" and that Labour will be proposing ""a more comprehensive system"" in which nobody would be ""worse off"". Speaking in Bristol, Mr Corbyn said that Labour would ""immediately stop the process"" of the nationwide rollout and would maintain ""existing levels of benefit immediately"". The switch to universal credit will create some winners, the Resolution Foundation says, with 1.1 million households an average of Â£53-a-week better off. But, overall, working families will be worse off than under the current benefit system, with the biggest losers likely to be people with children who are currently in receipt of tax credits, analysts say.

"Free my husband from UAE jail, wife pleads","Durham student Matthew Hedges is being held in ""inhumane and degrading"" conditions, says his wife A British student has been detained for the last five months in the United Arab Emirates ""without explanation"" after a research trip, his wife has said. Matthew Hedges, a PhD student at Durham University, has been held in solitary confinement after being accused of spying, according tothe Times.,external His wife said his rights were being ""violated on a daily basis"". Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he had raised ""a number of concerns"" about the case with his UAE counterpart. The Times reported that the 31-year-old, originally from Exeter, was arrested on 5 May at Dubai airport as he tried to leave following a research trip to interview sources about the country's security policies. Mr Hedges's case was heard by a court in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday, but was adjourned until another hearing on 24 October. Does UAE stability come at a price? United Arab Emirates profile His wife Daniela Tejada, who lives in Exeter with her husband, said in a statement: ""We cannot believe this has happened. ""We have been patient and done everything that has been advised, supposedly in Matt's best interest, but we can no longer go on like this."" She said he had visited the country ""exclusively for academic research purposes"" and had been detained without charge in an undisclosed location. She added: ""His rights are violated on a daily basis and I am shocked that more has not been done to get him out."" His family claim he was denied access to a shower for a month and was made to sleep on the floor for the first three months he was detained. Daniela Tejada says she is worried about her husband's mental health The Foreign Office said it was supporting a British man following his detention in the UAE. Mr Hunt said: ""We are very worried about this and I have mentioned it face-to-face with the Emirati foreign minister twice now."" British officials have twice visited Mr Hedges, who was researching the impact of the Arab Spring on the UAE's foreign policy and security strategy. Ms Tejada said she was worried what effect the ""traumatic experience"" will have on her husband's health. She added: ""I am shocked and confused by the whole situation and will do everything I can to make sure he comes home soon."" Durham University vice-chancellor Professor Stuart Corbridge said the university was ""seriously concerned about Matt's welfare and well-being"" and was assisting efforts to bring him home. The university has put a temporary ban on student research trips to the UAE for all non-UAE nationals until the reasons for the detention have been fully established.

Kanye: 'Trump made me feel like Superman'The rapper also banged his fist on the Oval Office's desk and discussed his bipolar diagnosis.,"This video can not be played Kanye: MAGA hat ""made me feel like Superman"" Kanye West launched into an expletive-filled rant as he lavished praise on US President Donald Trump at an event in the Oval Office. Wearing a Make America Great Again hat ""made me feel like Superman"", he said. West had been invited to the White House for lunch to discuss prison reform and other issues. At the end of the 10-minute monologue, during which Mr Trump nodded in approval, the president said: ""That was quite something."" West replied: ""It was from the soul. I just channelled it."" ""I love this guy right here,"" West said, walking behind the desk to hug the seated president, who said: ""That's really nice."" Allow Twitter content?

During his monologue that ranged from prison reform to manufacturing, politics and the universe, West said: ""They tried to scare me, my friends to not wear this hat, but this hat, it gives me power in a way. ""You know, my dad and my mum separated, so I didn't have a lot of male energy in my home."" He continued: ""I love Hillary, I love everyone, right. ""But the campaign, I'm With Her, just didn't make me feel as a guy that didn't get to see my dad all the time, like a guy that could play catch with his son."" Addressing Mr Trump, he added: ""There was something about when I put this hat on it made me feel like Superman. ""You made a Superman - that's my favourite superhero - you made a Superman cape for me."" West denied that all black Americans were Democrats. ""People expect that if you're black, you have to be Democrat,"" he said. ""If he [President Trump] don't look good, we don't look good,"" he said at one point, attacking the ""liberals"" on the Saturday Night Live show who have criticised his support for Mr Trump. Mr Trump won 8% of the African-American vote in 2016. Mr Trump was asked by a journalist if West could be a future presidential candidate, and the president replied: ""Could very well be."" West told reporters: ""Let's stop worrying about the future, all we have is today. ""Trump is on his hero's journey right now."" He added: ""You might not have expected a crazy [expletive] like Kanye running up to support."" West told the assembled group an earlier diagnosis of bipolar disorder was incorrect, according to a neuro-psychologist he saw. ""He said that I actually wasn't bipolar, I had sleep deprivation, which could cause dementia 10 to 20 years from now where I wouldn't even remember my son's name,"" he said. West has previously revealed he received treatment for bipolar disorder, and has made reference to it in his music. ""Sometimes people say, 'This kid has ADD [Attention Deficit Disorder], this kid has ADD.'"" ""You don't have ADD, school is boring. It is boring, it's not as exciting as this,"" he said gesturing towards his mobile phone. At one point he typed in his mobile phone password, in full view of the assembled news cameras - a fact which did not go unnoticed by the world. Allow Twitter content?

West was ostensibly at the lunch in part to discuss crime in Chicago, his hometown. He asked Mr Trump to pardon the leader of a notorious Chicago street gang, and called on the president to build ""Trump factories"" in Chicago. At one point he did disagree with Mr Trump, saying that he considers police ""stop-and-frisk"" to be unhelpful. Mr Trump has called upon Chicago police to institute the practice, which allows random searches. ""I didn't mean to put you on blast like that, bro,"" West told Mr Trump. ""I like the North Korea,"" West said. ""You stopped the war,"" he told Mr Trump. ""Day One, solved one of his biggest problems. We solved one of the biggest problems."" West visited Mr Trump at his eponymous Manhattan skyscraper in 2016, a month after he won the election, but this was the rapper's first trip to the White House. West's wife, reality TV star Kim Kardashian, has made two visits to the White House.

Trans inmate jailed for prison sex attacks,"Karen White must serve a minimum of nine years for rape, sexual assault and wounding A transgender prisoner who sexually assaulted two inmates at a women's jail and had previously raped two other women has been given a life sentence. Karen White attacked two women in 2017 while on remand at HMP New Hall, in Wakefield, for other offences. White, 52, who is transitioning, was described as a ""predator"" who was a danger to women and children. She must serve a minimum of nine-and-a-half years for rape, sexual assault and wounding, Leeds Crown Court was told. Reality Check: How many transgender prisoners are there? The court heard White, who was born male and now identifies as a woman, used her ""transgender persona"" to put herself in contact with vulnerable women. Karen White admitted two counts of sexual touching at New Hall Prison, Wakefield Passing sentence, Judge Christopher Batty said: ""You are a predator and highly manipulative and in my view you are a danger. ""You represent a significant risk of serious harm to children, to women and to the general public."" Latest news and stories from across Yorkshire White was on remand at HMP New Hall for other offences when she attacked the two women between September and October last year. She was moved to a male prison afterpleading guilty to the offences in September. She also is highly unlikely to be moved back into a women's prison due to the risk she poses even if she were to be legally declared a woman, the BBC understands. The court heard White has previous convictions for indecent assault, indecent exposure and gross indecency involving children, violence and dishonesty. Karen White was born Stephen Wood and is transitioning Prosecutor Christopher Dunn told the court: ""She is allegedly a transgender female. ""The prosecution say allegedly because there's smatterings of evidence in this case that the defendant's approach to transitioning has been less than committed. ""The prosecution suggest the reason for the lack of commitment towards transitioning is so the defendant can use a transgender persona to put herself in contact with vulnerable persons she can then abuse."" White, who was born Stephen Wood and is originally from the Manchester area, was first arrested last August after attacking a 66-year-old neighbour with a steak-knife in Mytholmroyd. While on remand at HMP New Hall, she began gender re-alignment, wearing a wig, make-up and false breasts. She also admitted to probation officers she was sexually interested in children and could abuse a child and ""think nothing of it"". The two counts of rape did not come to light until one of the victims came forward after White wrote to her from prison. The woman, in her 20s, said White had violently raped her five or six times between January and December 2016, after meeting at a psychiatric unit in West Yorkshire. Investigators also discovered White had raped a woman in 2003 when she was two months pregnant. The court heard White attacked her after spiking her drink with vodka until she passed out. White was arrested but no information was given in court as to why he was not prosecuted at the time. A Prison Service spokesman said: ""We apologise sincerely for the mistakes which were made in this case. ""While we work to manage all prisoners, including those who are transgender, sensitively and in line with the law, we are clear that the safety of all prisoners must be our absolute priority."" Det Insp David Rogerson said: ""White has pleaded guilty to a number of serious sexual offences which span many years.

New appeal to find 'man with the owl tattoo',"This video can not be played Josh Hanson's mother Tracey says the public ""have been amazing from day one"" Detectives in the UK have renewed their appeal to find one of the world's most wanted men. Shane O'Brien is a suspect in the murder of 21-year-old Josh Hanson three years ago. On the third anniversary of her son's death, his mother Tracey told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire Programme she ""will not let Josh down"" as she campaigns to get the suspect's face known. Mr Hanson, from London, was stabbed in the neck in a bar in 2015. The Metropolitan Police says Mr O'Brien was flown out of the UK on a privately-chartered plane from Biggin Hill Airport following Mr Hanson's death. Police probe Shane O'Brien 'sightings' Shane O'Brien on Europe's 'most wanted' list Mother and sister skydive to mark murdered man's birthday Detectives describe the 30-year-old, who speaks with a London accent, as ""very well-connected and supported"". They believe he is being helped by criminal associates,,externalwho are providing him with money, false identifies and the means to move across borders. Since Mr O'Brien fled the UK, he has had an enormous tattoo of an owl on his back, to cover up a previous smaller design. Police in the Czech Republic managed to photograph it when he was arrested for criminal damage there last year. He gave a false name and was released, with police only discovering his true identity later. After the attack on Mr Hanson, Mr O'Brien possibly went to the Netherlands and United Arab Emirates, before returning to Europe. A Â£50,000 reward is being offered for information leading to his prosecution. In May, he was added toInterpol's,externalmost-wanted list. Earlier this week, Tracey wore a sandwich board, with details of her son's murder, at train hubs in London to appeal for possible sightings. She said ""some people have still not heard about Josh"" and added: ""I thought about what might work and this grabs the attention of the commuter walking past. ""More people are engaging with us now and we are getting more requests for wanted posters."" Det Ch Insp Noel McHugh, who is leading the case for the Met Police, said: ""For Josh's family, the last three years, more than 1,000 days and nights without Josh - have been horrendous. ""No words adequately describe the pain they are going through."" Mr O'Brien is believed to have been travelling ""extensively"" with sightings reported in Gibraltar, Nice and Prague. He is known to like boxing and police hope any sports clubs around Europe, who recognise the tattoo, will get in contact.

Policing Trump's UK visit cost nearly Â£18m,"This video can not be played Thousands of protesters march through London The police operation for Donald Trump's controversial visit to the UK in July cost nearly Â£18m, it is estimated. Nearly 10,000 officers from across the country were needed to cover the US president's four-day trip, aNational Police Chiefs' Council blog,externalsays. It also says changes to pension rules could leave English and Welsh forces needing an extra Â£417m by 2020/21. That is equivalent to nearly 10,000 officers, it said, expressing ""grave concern"" about force sustainability. President Trump's visit coincided with increased demands on policing linked to the hot weather, summer festivals and the World Cup finals. In Pictures: Trump's UK visit and protests Trump's UK visit in nine moments Trump paraglider protest accused is freed The policing bill, estimated after gathering data from forces across the UK, was revealed in a post by council chairwoman Sara Thornton.

Hammond targets 'fake' self-employed,"The Treasury is finalising plans to overhaul tax rules which allow self-employed people to avoid paying national insurance contributions. The move will be targeted at people who set themselves up as private companies to take on work. The BBC understands it could be announced in this month's Budget. The Treasury believes a third of people claiming self-employed status as a ""personal service company"" are actually full employees and should pay more tax. It says without reform, high levels of non-compliance with tax rules could cost HM Revenue and Customs, which collects taxes, Â£1.2bn a year by 2023. It is now looking at demanding that firms which use personal service company contractors take legal responsibility for ensuring ""off-payroll"" contractors stick to the tax rules known as IR35. A similar move in the public sector on ""synthetic"" self-employed has raised Â£410m extra in taxes since 2016, HMRC estimates suggest. Full employees pay higher levels of national insurance compared with the self-employed. Philip Hammond is under pressure to raise taxes at the Budget following the Prime Minister's pledge of Â£20bn worth of extra spending on the NHS by 2023. Personal income tax allowances could be frozen, despite a Tory pledge at the 2017 election that they would rise to Â£12,500 for lower rate taxpayers and Â£50,000 for higher rate taxpayers by 2020. Freezing them could raise up to Â£2bn a year. Reform of the IR35 rules would not raise as much, but might be less politically controversial. In March 2017, the chancellor failed to gain Parliamentary support for an increase in national insurance contributions from the self-employed and had to abandon the move. Without a majority in Parliament, the Conservatives know that any major changes on tax might be voted down. Representatives of the contracting industry are also likely to react with anger at the proposed changes. They point out that freelancers charge more for their services than they would if they were ""employed"", so any tax gain would be wiped out, as incomes on which tax is paid would be lower. It is also argued that the public sector reforms on who enforces the rules have been beset with difficulty. ""The Treasury's claim that it is losing money is based on an ideological flaw and fails to acknowledge the 'freelance premium' that individuals charge for their services, compared to what they earn when they are in full-time employment,"" said David Chaplin, chief executive of Contractor Calculator which gives advice to self-employed workers. ""That fact alone should blow IR35 out of the water, yet HMRC maintains that individuals are avoiding tax. ""This isn't true. HMRC's own calculations demonstrate that 84% of the perceived tax loss where an individual is engaged via a personal service company results from the hiring organisation not having to pay employer's national insurance. ""Despite this, HMRC continues to suggest that flexible workers are responsible for this perceived shortfall."" The Association of Independent Professionals and the Self Employed (IPSE), agreed with Mr Chaplin. Its deputy director of policy, Andy Chamberlain, said: ""Business groups have been almost unanimous in their view on this issue. ""Businesses will not be ready to implement such a measure in April 2019. If the chancellor does push ahead with this, he will be flying in the face of the very businesses he pledged to support less than two weeks ago at the Conservative Party conference.""

Mum with baby refused entry to 15 film,"The film stars Bradley Cooper and Lady Gaga A mum has criticised Cineworld staff who refused to let her into a screening of Lady Gaga hit A Star is Born with a four-week-old baby. Catherine Buckley, 37, was not allowed to view the Bradley Cooper-directed 15-certificate drama at the chain's Shrewsbury multiplex. Mrs Buckley said her daughter Rosie ""wouldn't know what was going on"". In a statement, Cineworld said staff ""were acting in accordance with the age restriction law."" Mrs Buckley said she had been to the cinema before with her other child to special ""Babes in Arms"" showings where infants can attend screenings in the morning and afternoons with parents. The mum-of-two said she and her sister were about to enter Tuesday's screening when they were approached by a member of staff who said: ""We're not sure you can take her in, she's not 15."" ""We thought they were joking but they said no, we actually couldn't take her in,"" Mrs Buckley said. Latest news and live updates from the West Midlands ""I understand that there has to be rules and legislation in place but they're asleep for 18 hours a day. Cineworld said they were ""sorry"" Mrs Buckley was ""disappointed"" ""She can only make out near shapes... she wouldn't know what was going on at all, so is she not allowed to sit at home and watch the news?"" Cineworld said British Board of Film Classification rules meant anyone under-age, including babies, could not be let into age-rated films.

Orphanages were places of 'threat and abuse',"The Smyllum Park Orphanage closed in 1981 Children at Smyllum Park orphanage were sexually abused and beaten with leather straps, hairbrushes and crucifixes, the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry has found. Nuns belonging to the Daughters of Charity of St Vincent de Paul ran the Catholic Children's home near Lanark, as well as Bellevue House, Rutherglen. Lady Smith, who is chairing the inquiry, has published a report on evidence heard during the case study. She said the homes were places of fear, threat, and excessive discipline. The judge said emotional, physical and sexual abuse took place. The children found ""no love, no compassion, no dignity and no comfort,"" she said. The inquiry is chaired by High Court judge Lady Smith The inquiry was set up in October 2015 to look at the historical abuse of children in care across Scotland. It is currently in the process of looking at allegations of physical and sexual abuse at 86 institutions, including former children's homes and leading boarding schools. The inquiry, which has cost Â£15.67m so far, was originally scheduled to end next year but the Scottish government has since said it can take as long as it needs. From the end of November last year, the child abuse inquiry heard case study evidence over 20 days about the Daughters of Charity of St Vincent de Paul. A total of 54 witnesses told of their experiences at Smyllum Park, which closed in 1981, and Bellevue House, which closed in 1961, and 21 written statements were submitted. Lady Smith's interim report into the Smyllum and BelleVue case studies concluded: Children were abused while in the care of the Daughters of Charity of St Vincent de Paul They were sexually abused in Smyllum by priests, a trainee priest, nuns, members of staff and a volunteer. The abuse was, in some cases, prolonged. There was also problematic sexual behaviour by other children. Children were hit with implements, the punishment being either excessive or for reasons which the child could not fathom. The implements used included leather straps, the ""Lochgelly Tawse,"" hairbrushes, sticks, footwear, rosary beads, wooden crucifixes and a dog's lead. For some children, being hit was a normal aspect of daily life. The physical punishments meted out to children went beyond what was acceptable at the time whether as punishment in schools or in the home. Children who were bed-wetters were abused physically and emotionally. They were beaten, put in cold baths and humiliated in ways that included ""wearing"" their wet sheets and being subjected to hurtful name-calling by Sisters and by other children. Many children were force-fed. Children were used as unpaid labour. Many children were forced to queue in a state of undress for a bath and shared bathwater that was too hot or cold and dirty. There was no system for marking children's birthdays. Some children didn't know when their birthday was. Children were abused for being left-handed and forced to use their right hands instead. Some were abused for being Protestants and one child was told the Jewishness would be knocked out of him The report names Charlie Forsyth, a former Smyllum resident who went on to work in the home, as someone who physically and emotionally abused children. Forsyth, who is now dead, was said to have given out violent, angry beatings and called the children demeaning. It was said that he had complete autonomy. Lady Smith's report also highlights the case of Samuel Carr, a child in Smyllum, who died aged six as a result of contracting a severe and vicious E. coli infection after contact with a rat. He was malnourished despite having been in Smyllum for a significant time. He had received a severe beating from a Sister not long before his death, the report says. Francis McColl, was 13 when he died in Smyllum after an accident in which he was hit by a golf club when it was being swung. Patricia Meenan died aged 12 when she was hit by a car when she was running away from Smyllum to go back to Glasgow. Lady Smith's said she would take her findings into account when she analysed all the evidence gathered by the inquiry and decides what recommendations to make within the final report. Memorial stone at St Mary's Cemetery to remember all who died at Smyllum Park Orphanage Children were abused - three words from Lady Smith which will mean everything to former residents from the two homes. For years they've alleged they were victims of physical abuse, sexual abuse and emotional abuse - and now the chair of the Scottish Child Abuse Inquiry has said she believes them. Lady Smith described Smyllum Park and Bellevue House as places of fear, where many children found no love, no compassion, no dignity and no comfort. For some, she said, being hit was a normal aspect of daily life. The order which ran the homes, the Daughters of Charity of St Vincent De Paul have repeated their apology to anyone who suffered abuse in their care.

Teacher banned for claiming trip cash,"David Malengela had responsibility for organising overseas trips at St Peter's School in Huntingdon A languages teacher found to have claimed extra cash from parents for school trips has been banned from the classroom. David Malengela, 41, had responsibility for organising overseas trips at St Peter's School in Huntingdon. The disciplinary hearing was told he asked parents for additional ""behaviour deposits"" and charged pupils 20 euros each just to board the coach. A misconduct panel said his actions were ""calculated and deliberate"". Read more Cambridgeshire stories The Teaching Regulation Agency's professional conduct panel was told Mr Malengela planned three residential trips for the 2017 summer term. Between February and June 2017, the school's finance team made repeated requests for pupil numbers and money, without success. The three-member panel was told Mr Malengela wrote to parents to say the Â£390 cost of a trip to Paris had gone up, citing an ""additional Â£20 refundable behaviour deposit for the Hotel Bon-Sejour"". The tour operator was unaware of the deposit, the hearing learned, and a price increase had not been agreed by the school. Parents were also asked for an additional payment of 20 euros ""to be paid to him personally as the children boarded the coach on departure"". At a briefing session, he also asked families for a security deposit of 25 euros and money to attend a science museum, the panel found. In its concluding report, the panel said a ""subsequent disciplinary investigation by the school alleged serious irregularities in the administration of the trips"". Mr Malengela resigned in May 2017. The total amount of money he received was not revealed. Mr Malengela taught French at St Peter's School in Huntingdon The panel concluded the teacher's conduct ""fell short of the expected standards of the profession"" and ""the offence of fraud is relevant"". He was banned from teaching in any school, sixth form college or children's home in England indefinitely. Mr Malengela has 28 days to appeal.

Record-breaking storm mauls US south-east,"This video can not be played Aerial footage shows the destruction in Mexico Beach, Florida One of the strongest storms in recorded history to hit the US has battered north-west Florida, flooding homes, washing out beaches and snapping trees. Rescue services are beginning to assess the full impact of Hurricane Michael, which made landfall on Wednesday afternoon as a category four storm with 155mph (250km/h) winds. At least six people have been killed, most of them in Florida. Having weakened to a tropical storm, Michael has been hitting the Carolinas. In pictures: Hurricane Michael hits Florida How to survive a monster storm Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Storm-surge warnings are still in place, the US National Hurricane Center says, and residents across the southern US have been warned of the continuing danger from downed powerlines, flash floods and landslides. This video can not be played Storm Michael's trail of devastation There are fears for people who ignored evacuation warnings in some of the areas now flooded. Hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses were left without electricity in Florida, Alabama and Georgia. Debris in Panama City, Florida Michael made landfall near Mexico Beach, Florida, at around 14:00 (18:00 GMT) on Wednesday. It ranks among the most powerful hurricanes to hit the US in terms of wind speed and barometric pressure, comparable to Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Trailer homes were ravaged in Panama City, Florida Michael was so strong as it swept into Florida that it remained a hurricane for hours as it moved further inland, before being downgraded to a tropical storm. Its rapid intensification caught many by surprise, although the storm later weakened. Are hurricanes getting worse? A guide to the world's deadliest storms Unusually warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico turbo-charged the storm from a tropical depression on Sunday. This video can not be played Hurricane Michael strikes Florida On Tuesday it was still a category two hurricane but by Wednesday morning it had reached borderline category five, the highest level. Florida officials say at least four people died as a result of the storm in Gadsden County. In Seminole County, Georgia, a metal car-shelter lifted by a gust of wind hit a mobile home, killing a girl of 11. And a man died when a tree fell on his car near Charlotte, North Carolina on Thursday. Michael earlier reportedly killed at least 13 people as it passed through Central America: six in Honduras, four in Nicaragua and three in El Salvador. The storm has knocked out power to more than 900,000 homes and businesses. More than 370,000 people in Florida were ordered to evacuate but officials believe many ignored the warning. The coastal city of Apalachicola reported a storm surge of nearly 8ft (2.5m). This McDonald's sign was twisted by the storm in Panama City Beach ""There are so many downed power lines and trees that it's almost impossible to get through the city,"" local mayor Van Johnson was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. Florida Governor Rick Scott said the US Coast Guard had carried out 10 missions overnight, saving at least 27 people. ""So many lives have been changed forever,"" he told reporters. ""So many families have lost everything. This hurricane was an absolute monster."" Images from Mexico Beach show many homes submerged in water, and there was severe damage to buildings in the state's Panama City area.

This video can not be played Hurricane Michael as seen from space A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face.

Trans inmate jailed for prison sex attacksKaren White was jailed for sexually assaulting two inmates and raping two women outside prison.Leeds & West Yorkshire,"Karen White must serve a minimum of nine years for rape, sexual assault and wounding A transgender prisoner who sexually assaulted two inmates at a women's jail and had previously raped two other women has been given a life sentence. Karen White attacked two women in 2017 while on remand at HMP New Hall, in Wakefield, for other offences. White, 52, who is transitioning, was described as a ""predator"" who was a danger to women and children. She must serve a minimum of nine-and-a-half years for rape, sexual assault and wounding, Leeds Crown Court was told. Reality Check: How many transgender prisoners are there? The court heard White, who was born male and now identifies as a woman, used her ""transgender persona"" to put herself in contact with vulnerable women. Karen White admitted two counts of sexual touching at New Hall Prison, Wakefield Passing sentence, Judge Christopher Batty said: ""You are a predator and highly manipulative and in my view you are a danger. ""You represent a significant risk of serious harm to children, to women and to the general public."" Latest news and stories from across Yorkshire White was on remand at HMP New Hall for other offences when she attacked the two women between September and October last year. She was moved to a male prison afterpleading guilty to the offences in September. She also is highly unlikely to be moved back into a women's prison due to the risk she poses even if she were to be legally declared a woman, the BBC understands. The court heard White has previous convictions for indecent assault, indecent exposure and gross indecency involving children, violence and dishonesty. Karen White was born Stephen Wood and is transitioning Prosecutor Christopher Dunn told the court: ""She is allegedly a transgender female. ""The prosecution say allegedly because there's smatterings of evidence in this case that the defendant's approach to transitioning has been less than committed. ""The prosecution suggest the reason for the lack of commitment towards transitioning is so the defendant can use a transgender persona to put herself in contact with vulnerable persons she can then abuse."" White, who was born Stephen Wood and is originally from the Manchester area, was first arrested last August after attacking a 66-year-old neighbour with a steak-knife in Mytholmroyd. While on remand at HMP New Hall, she began gender re-alignment, wearing a wig, make-up and false breasts. She also admitted to probation officers she was sexually interested in children and could abuse a child and ""think nothing of it"". The two counts of rape did not come to light until one of the victims came forward after White wrote to her from prison. The woman, in her 20s, said White had violently raped her five or six times between January and December 2016, after meeting at a psychiatric unit in West Yorkshire. Investigators also discovered White had raped a woman in 2003 when she was two months pregnant. The court heard White attacked her after spiking her drink with vodka until she passed out. White was arrested but no information was given in court as to why he was not prosecuted at the time. A Prison Service spokesman said: ""We apologise sincerely for the mistakes which were made in this case. ""While we work to manage all prisoners, including those who are transgender, sensitively and in line with the law, we are clear that the safety of all prisoners must be our absolute priority."" Det Insp David Rogerson said: ""White has pleaded guilty to a number of serious sexual offences which span many years.

Skateboard hero receives bravery award,"The parents of a Spanish banker who was killed confronting terrorists during the London Bridge attack have accepted a civilian medal on his behalf. Wielding only his skateboard, Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, 39, tried to fight off one of the terrorists who killed eight people on 3 June last year. His parents were presented with the George Medal during a ceremony at Buckingham Palace on Thursday. Two police officers also received the same award for their actions. At the ceremony his father JoaquÃ­n EcheverrÃ­a Alonso said it was a ""special moment but very emotional"" for him and his wife Miralles De Imperial Hornedo. He said the award helped ""recognise the courage of my son"". ""Since Ignacio's death we have lived a year of intense emotions,"" he said. ""There has been pain and love and I have reflected on the meaning of duty and commitment. ""I have been compelled to think about what really matters and what is worth taking risks and fighting for; life, freedom, dignity, for oneself and for others."" Ignacio had been working for HSBC as part of the bank's team fighting money laundering Mr EcheverrÃ­a Alonso said his son was ""committed to helping others"" and his bravery on the day was not just a spur of the moment decision. He told the BBC that Ignacio had said he would have intervened if he had been passing the Westminster Bridge attack which happened three months earlier. ""Ignacio told us that if he had have been skateboarding past on that occasion then the police officer would have survived, because he would have tried to help. ""Later, during the attack at London Bridge, he demonstrated this through his actions."" Eight people were killed in the London Bridge attack Three men drove a van into pedestrians on London Bridgebefore launching a knife attack in Borough Marketlast year. They killedeight people. Mr Alonso said: ""When terrorists attack someone they attack our entire way of life. ""They manipulate words and minds and try and convince us that they have acted in the name of a cause. ""So when Ignacio is recognised with an award, it represents the opposite of all of that."" He said he was grateful to be receiving the George Medal on his son's behalf because it showed the UK considered his actions to be ""important"". PC Charles Guenigault and PC Wayne Marqueswere also given the bravery award. PC Leon McLeod was awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal for running at the terrorists and then providing aid to victims following the attack. The award was created in September 1940 under the reign of King George VI, initially to reward acts of civilian courage and bravery during the Blitz. Since then it has been awarded more than 2,000 times, and some military personnel have received it for ""gallant conduct that is not in the face of the enemy"". Posthumous recipients of themedal include PC Keith Palmer,who was fatally stabbed outside the Houses of Parliament in March 2017 during the Westminster terror attack.

Stars' #MeToo fund gives ÃÂ£1m to UK victims,"Actress Emma Watson has donated a large sum to the fund A fund set up by British celebrities in response to the #MeToo movement has given more than Â£1m to women's groups across the UK. The Justice and Equality Fund has been backed by stars including Emma Watson, Keira Knightley and Jodie Whittaker. The first grants were given to seven UK organisations which help women who have suffered sexual harassment and abuse. Harry Potter star Watson,who donated Â£1m to the fund earlier this year, said it was ""just the beginning"". She added that the grants were ""pivotal in supporting the dynamic work of vital UK women's organisations"". Almost exactly a year after the first #MeToo tweet - the Justice and Equality Fund awarded Â£1,027,699 to seven women's organisations in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. These were the first grants to be awarded from the fund. The next recipients will be announced in November. The Women's Aid Federation in Northern Ireland will receive Â£200,000 to re-establish a pilot rape crisis service there after a 12-year gap.

"Record-breaking storm mauls US south-eastMichael, the third-strongest storm to hit the US mainland, batters Florida and heads for the Carolinas.US & Canada","This video can not be played Aerial footage shows the destruction in Mexico Beach, Florida One of the strongest storms in recorded history to hit the US has battered north-west Florida, flooding homes, washing out beaches and snapping trees. Rescue services are beginning to assess the full impact of Hurricane Michael, which made landfall on Wednesday afternoon as a category four storm with 155mph (250km/h) winds. At least six people have been killed, most of them in Florida. Having weakened to a tropical storm, Michael has been hitting the Carolinas. In pictures: Hurricane Michael hits Florida How to survive a monster storm Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. Storm-surge warnings are still in place, the US National Hurricane Center says, and residents across the southern US have been warned of the continuing danger from downed powerlines, flash floods and landslides. This video can not be played Storm Michael's trail of devastation There are fears for people who ignored evacuation warnings in some of the areas now flooded. Hundreds of thousands of homes and businesses were left without electricity in Florida, Alabama and Georgia. Debris in Panama City, Florida Michael made landfall near Mexico Beach, Florida, at around 14:00 (18:00 GMT) on Wednesday. It ranks among the most powerful hurricanes to hit the US in terms of wind speed and barometric pressure, comparable to Hurricane Andrew in 1992. Trailer homes were ravaged in Panama City, Florida Michael was so strong as it swept into Florida that it remained a hurricane for hours as it moved further inland, before being downgraded to a tropical storm. Its rapid intensification caught many by surprise, although the storm later weakened. Are hurricanes getting worse? A guide to the world's deadliest storms Unusually warm waters in the Gulf of Mexico turbo-charged the storm from a tropical depression on Sunday. This video can not be played Hurricane Michael strikes Florida On Tuesday it was still a category two hurricane but by Wednesday morning it had reached borderline category five, the highest level. Florida officials say at least four people died as a result of the storm in Gadsden County. In Seminole County, Georgia, a metal car-shelter lifted by a gust of wind hit a mobile home, killing a girl of 11. And a man died when a tree fell on his car near Charlotte, North Carolina on Thursday. Michael earlier reportedly killed at least 13 people as it passed through Central America: six in Honduras, four in Nicaragua and three in El Salvador. The storm has knocked out power to more than 900,000 homes and businesses. More than 370,000 people in Florida were ordered to evacuate but officials believe many ignored the warning. The coastal city of Apalachicola reported a storm surge of nearly 8ft (2.5m). This McDonald's sign was twisted by the storm in Panama City Beach ""There are so many downed power lines and trees that it's almost impossible to get through the city,"" local mayor Van Johnson was quoted as saying by Reuters news agency. Florida Governor Rick Scott said the US Coast Guard had carried out 10 missions overnight, saving at least 27 people. ""So many lives have been changed forever,"" he told reporters. ""So many families have lost everything. This hurricane was an absolute monster."" Images from Mexico Beach show many homes submerged in water, and there was severe damage to buildings in the state's Panama City area.

This video can not be played Hurricane Michael as seen from space A guide to the world's deadliest storms  Hurricanes are violent storms that can bring devastation to coastal areas, threatening lives, homes and businesses. Hurricanes develop from thunderstorms, fuelled by warm, moist air as they cross sub-tropical waters.Warm air rises into the storm. Air swirls in to fill the low pressure in the storm, sucking air in and upwards, reinforcing the low pressure. The storm rotates due to the spin of the earth and energy from the warm ocean increases wind speeds as it builds. When winds reach 119km/h (74mph), it is known as a hurricane - in the Atlantic and Eastern Pacific - or a typhoon in the Western Pacific. ""Everybody has a plan until they get punched in the face. Well, we're about to get punched in the face.""Florida Mayor Bob Buckhorn, ahead of Hurricane Irma (2017)  The central eye of calmer weather is surrounded by a wall of rainstorms.This eyewall has the fastest winds below it and violent currents of air rising through it.

eBay tax bill rises after HMRC review,"Auction site eBay's UK subsidiary has agreed to pay an extra Â£7m in tax following a review by HMRC. According to the latest accounts from the firm, its sales in 2017 rose to more than Â£500m, but its profits were still relatively small at Â£20m. The Â£7m payment covers tax liabilities for previous financial years. Its tax bill for 2017 came to another Â£6m. In 2016, eBay paid only Â£1.6m in corporation tax on declared profits of Â£7.7m. An eBay spokesperson said it complied with all the relevant laws and rules of every country it worked in, including the UK. A spokesperson for HMRC said it did not comment on identifiable taxpayers, but added: ""HMRC has a very strong track record on challenging contrived tax arrangements. We make sure that large businesses, just like everyone else, pay all the taxes due under UK law and we don't settle for less."" eBay accuses Amazon of in merchant poaching row Could Amazon wage move mean higher UK tax bill? Facebook's UK tax bill jumps as profits rise EU pushes for new tax on tech giants soon The settlement makes eBay the latest online giant to pay more tax in the UK after public concern that such companies have not been paying their fair share. Big technology companies have frequently been criticised for booking profits in other countries and paying modest amounts of tax in the UK. Earlier this week, it emerged thatFacebook's UK tax bill tripled to Â£15.8m in 2017.

Standing-desk workers 'more engaged',"New research suggests that standing desks, which allow employees to alter their position during the day, may boost performance at work. A number of NHS staff were given new desks and set goals for standing time. After a year, researchers found sitting time was reduced by more than an hour a day compared with their colleagues. Employees who reduced time sitting, by using desks that also allowed them to work while on their feet, also said they were less tired and more engaged. Could offices change from sitting to standing? The research team, led by Loughborough University and experts from Leicester, assessed 146 mainly sedentary NHS staff. Seventy-seven were put in an intervention group and given height-adjustable workstations - also known as sit-stand desks - while the remaining 69 continued with their standard desks. Working time spent sitting was measured at the start of the study and again three, six and 12 months later. At the start of the study, overall sitting time was 9.7 hours per day. Over the course of the experiment, sitting time was lower by 50.62 minutes per day at three months, 64.4 minutes per day at six months, and 82.39 minutes per day at 12 months. Those who were given sit-stand desks also reported improvements in musculoskeletal problems, according to the research published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ). A questionnaire filled out by the participants also suggested employees who used the sit-stand desks were less anxious and cited an improved quality of life - but no notable changes were found for job satisfaction, cognitive function or sickness absence. Medical research has suggested constant sitting is harming our health - potentially causing cardiovascular problems or vulnerability to diabetes. A survey by the British Heart Foundation in 2015found that the average person sat for almost all of the nine hours spent in the office. But it's not the case everywhere. In Sweden, sit-stand working is commonplace - and in 2014, Denmark made it mandatory for employers to offer their staff sit-stand desks. However, the authors of the report say more research is needed to gauge the longer-term benefits. The risks of sitting all day long.

The first grants were given to seven UK organisations which help women who have suffered sexual harassment and abuse. Harry Potter star Watson,who donated Â£1m to the fund earlier this year, said it was ""just the beginning"". She added that the grants were ""pivotal in supporting the dynamic work of vital UK women's organisations"".

Twelve died - including a British couple - when torrential rain lashed eastern Majorca in Spain. An eight-year-old local boy is still missing. Three Germans and a Dutch woman were among those who lost their lives. A flash flood on France's south coast killed two people in Sainte-Maxime while a woman was found dead after a storm in Sardinia, Italy. The two British victims were found in this taxi, which had been swept away The two British victims of the Majorca floods were named as Anthony and Delia Green, a pair of holidaymakers in their 70s, from Moffat in Dumfries and Galloway. They were discovered in their submerged taxi, which had been swept away in Sillot, near the tourist town of Sant LlorenÃ§. The body of the taxi driver was discovered nearby. Homes in Sant LlorenÃ§ suffered heavy flood damage Police in Sant LlorenÃ§ say they are dealing with many incidents of looting and have increased patrols. Spanish Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez has said it will take months to return the disaster-hit towns to normality. More than 100 rescue workers searched through the night for the missing eight-year-old boy. He is believed to have been in a car with his mother, who is among the victims. His sister, who was also in the car, survived and was rescued.

Skateboard hero to receive bravery award,"The parents of a Spanish banker who was killed confronting terrorists during the London Bridge attack have accepted a civilian medal on his behalf. Wielding only his skateboard, Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, 39, tried to fight off one of the terrorists who killed eight people on 3 June last year. His parents were presented with the George Medal during a ceremony at Buckingham Palace on Thursday. Two police officers also received the same award for their actions. At the ceremony his father JoaquÃ­n EcheverrÃ­a Alonso said it was a ""special moment but very emotional"" for him and his wife Miralles De Imperial Hornedo. He said the award helped ""recognise the courage of my son"". ""Since Ignacio's death we have lived a year of intense emotions,"" he said. ""There has been pain and love and I have reflected on the meaning of duty and commitment. ""I have been compelled to think about what really matters and what is worth taking risks and fighting for; life, freedom, dignity, for oneself and for others."" Ignacio had been working for HSBC as part of the bank's team fighting money laundering Mr EcheverrÃ­a Alonso said his son was ""committed to helping others"" and his bravery on the day was not just a spur of the moment decision. He told the BBC that Ignacio had said he would have intervened if he had been passing the Westminster Bridge attack which happened three months earlier. ""Ignacio told us that if he had have been skateboarding past on that occasion then the police officer would have survived, because he would have tried to help. ""Later, during the attack at London Bridge, he demonstrated this through his actions."" Eight people were killed in the London Bridge attack Three men drove a van into pedestrians on London Bridgebefore launching a knife attack in Borough Marketlast year. They killedeight people. Mr Alonso said: ""When terrorists attack someone they attack our entire way of life. ""They manipulate words and minds and try and convince us that they have acted in the name of a cause. ""So when Ignacio is recognised with an award, it represents the opposite of all of that."" He said he was grateful to be receiving the George Medal on his son's behalf because it showed the UK considered his actions to be ""important"". PC Charles Guenigault and PC Wayne Marqueswere also given the bravery award. PC Leon McLeod was awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal for running at the terrorists and then providing aid to victims following the attack. The award was created in September 1940 under the reign of King George VI, initially to reward acts of civilian courage and bravery during the Blitz. Since then it has been awarded more than 2,000 times, and some military personnel have received it for ""gallant conduct that is not in the face of the enemy"". Posthumous recipients of themedal include PC Keith Palmer,who was fatally stabbed outside the Houses of Parliament in March 2017 during the Westminster terror attack.

Major: Universal credit like 80s poll tax,"This video can not be played Sir John Major warns the Conservatives over universal credit Benefit changes coming into force next year have been compared to the poll tax - the policy that helped end Margaret Thatcher's time as prime minister. Mrs Thatcher's successor as PM, Sir John Major, said universal credit was being rushed in without enough funding. About 3.2 million households will be worse off by an average of about Â£50 a week,according to the Resolution Foundation think-tank.,external Prime Minister Theresa May has promised financial help for those affected. But the compensation system is not in place yet - and the Resolution Foundation said less than 20% of affected families are expected to receive support from it. People whose circumstances change, who make a brand new claim, or who come off benefits and then go back on them, will not be protected. McDonnell: Universal credit has to go Benefit plan 'risks social unrest' - Brown Poll tax was a serious mistake, says Waldegrave The switch to universal credit will also create winners, the Resolution Foundation says, with 1.1 million households an average of Â£53 a week better off. But, overall, working families will be worse off than under the current benefit system, with the biggest losers likely to be people with children who are currently in receipt of tax credits, analysts say. Veteran anti-poverty campaigner Frank Field said families in his Birkenhead constituency were being forced into ""destitution"" by the introduction of universal credit. He urged the government to pause the rollout to fix the problems with it and ensure extra money was pumped into the system so that ""people don't face up to a Â£2,000 a year wipe out of their meagre living standards"". The chair of the commons work and pensions committee said Theresa May faced a choice between ""going down the road Mrs Thatcher faced"" over the poll tax or acting now to fix the new benefit. The poll tax - whose official name was the Community Charge - was supposed to make local council finance fairer and more accountable by getting all adults to have to pay it, rather than charging a tax per property. However it proved unpopular, with many refusing to pay it, riots in London and a rebellion in the Conservative Party which contributed to the fall of Margaret Thatcher as prime minister. Universal credit is a new benefit for working-age people that consolidates into one monthly payment six separate benefits: income support income-based jobseeker's allowance income-related employment and support allowance housing benefit child tax credit working tax credit Read more:What is universal credit? Currently being phased in for different types of claimant across the UK, it is aimed at making the system simpler and more flexible so people who are able to work are rewarded for doing so. The plan is to move all existing claimants on to universal credit next year. Thousands took to the streets to protest against the poll tax The Conservatives note that the numbers of people in work has been increasing, but universal credit has been criticised for running over budget and causing delays to people's payments. On Wednesday, another former prime minister, Labour's Gordon Brown, also attacked the scheme, calling for it to be put on hold. The current Labour leadership has gone further and vowed to scrap it. Speaking on theBBC's Political Thinking podcast, Sir John - who was PM from 1990 to 1997 - said the theory behind the reform was ""impeccable"" and ""entirely logical"" - but he warned against it being introduced ""too soon and in the wrong circumstances"". He said people who faced losing out in the short term had to be protected, ""or you run into the sort of problems the Conservative Party ran into with the poll tax in the late 1980s"". Sir John, who scrapped the poll tax when he replaced Mrs Thatcher in Downing Street, said he was not predicting riots as a result of universal credit. But, referring toreports that millions of households,externalfaced losing Â£2,400 a year, he said: ""I am saying that if you have people who have that degree of loss, that is not something that the majority of the British population would think of as fair. ""And if people think you have to remove yourself from fairness, then you are in deep political trouble."" Iain Duncan Smith: Â£2bn was 'taken out of universal credit' Downing Street has said no-one moving on to universal credit would lose out and that the nationwide rollout next year would proceed gradually, in order to identify difficulties. But the man who designed universal credit, Iain Duncan Smith, is calling on Philip Hammond to scrap promised income tax cuts for low-paid workers and put the money into universal credit instead. Universal credit is meant to make work pay by only steadily removing benefits as people gain more hours at work, rather than having cut-off points beyond which the amount of hours worked is not worth it because of a sudden loss of benefits. But it was made significantly less generous by former Chancellor George Osborne in his 2015 Budget, who raided it to pay for an increase in the personal allowance, the point at which people start paying income tax. It is these changes that are due to come into effect at the start of next year for millions of people on working age benefits. When Mr Duncan Smith quit as work and pension secretary he cited Mr Osborne's decision, which he claimed robbed universal credit of its original purpose. The Conservatives promised to raise the personal allowance to Â£12,500 at last year's general election. Mr Duncan Smith told BBC Radio 4's Today programme on Thursday the government should ditch that promise and ""direct the money back into universal credit exactly as it was originally planned to be rolled out"". Asked how much more needed to go into the system, he replied: ""The reality is the Â£2bn that was taken out.""

"Free my husband from UAE jail, wife pleas","Durham student Matthew Hedges is being held in ""inhumane and degrading"" conditions, says his wife A British student has been detained for the last five months in the United Arab Emirates ""without explanation"" after a research trip, his wife has said. Matthew Hedges, a PhD student at Durham University, has been held in solitary confinement after being accused of spying, according tothe Times.,external His wife said his rights were being ""violated on a daily basis"". Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said he had raised ""a number of concerns"" about the case with his UAE counterpart. The Times reported that the 31-year-old, originally from Exeter, was arrested on 5 May at Dubai airport as he tried to leave following a research trip to interview sources about the country's security policies. Mr Hedges's case was heard by a court in Abu Dhabi on Wednesday, but was adjourned until another hearing on 24 October. Does UAE stability come at a price? United Arab Emirates profile His wife Daniela Tejada, who lives in Exeter with her husband, said in a statement: ""We cannot believe this has happened. ""We have been patient and done everything that has been advised, supposedly in Matt's best interest, but we can no longer go on like this."" She said he had visited the country ""exclusively for academic research purposes"" and had been detained without charge in an undisclosed location. She added: ""His rights are violated on a daily basis and I am shocked that more has not been done to get him out."" His family claim he was denied access to a shower for a month and was made to sleep on the floor for the first three months he was detained. Daniela Tejada says she is worried about her husband's mental health The Foreign Office said it was supporting a British man following his detention in the UAE. Mr Hunt said: ""We are very worried about this and I have mentioned it face-to-face with the Emirati foreign minister twice now."" British officials have twice visited Mr Hedges, who was researching the impact of the Arab Spring on the UAE's foreign policy and security strategy. Ms Tejada said she was worried what effect the ""traumatic experience"" will have on her husband's health. She added: ""I am shocked and confused by the whole situation and will do everything I can to make sure he comes home soon."" Durham University vice-chancellor Professor Stuart Corbridge said the university was ""seriously concerned about Matt's welfare and well-being"" and was assisting efforts to bring him home. The university has put a temporary ban on student research trips to the UAE for all non-UAE nationals until the reasons for the detention have been fully established.

Trump UK visit cost nearly Â£18m to police,"This video can not be played Thousands of protesters march through London The police operation for Donald Trump's controversial visit to the UK in July cost nearly Â£18m, it is estimated. Nearly 10,000 officers from across the country were needed to cover the US president's four-day trip, aNational Police Chiefs' Council blog,externalsays. It also says changes to pension rules could leave English and Welsh forces needing an extra Â£417m by 2020/21. That is equivalent to nearly 10,000 officers, it said, expressing ""grave concern"" about force sustainability. President Trump's visit coincided with increased demands on policing linked to the hot weather, summer festivals and the World Cup finals. In Pictures: Trump's UK visit and protests Trump's UK visit in nine moments Trump paraglider protest accused is freed The policing bill, estimated after gathering data from forces across the UK, was revealed in a post by council chairwoman Sara Thornton. ""The majority of forces had to cancel officers' rest days, and extend the length of their shifts,"" she said. She praised the ""hard work"" of officers in ensuring that the ""public were kept safe throughout"". Mr Trump met the Queen at Windsor Castle during his visit During his UK trip President Trump visited Prime Minister Theresa May at her country residence Chequers. He attended a dinner at Winston Churchill's ancestral home, Blenheim Palace, in Oxfordshire, met the Queen at Windsor Castle and played golf in South Ayrshire. Although his schedule largely avoided big cities, protests about his presence in the UK were held in England and Scotland. In London tens of thousands of people gathered at an anti-Trump march, which featured a crowd-funded balloon ofDonald Trump as a baby, holding a mobile phone. Mr Trump was booed by onlookers as he played golf in Turnberry, Scotland The police operation did not go without incident. The US president and property magnate was heckled by protesters as he played at his golf course in Turnberry. A paraglider flew close to the course's hotel with a Greenpeace banner reading: ""Trump: well below par #resist"". Police Scotland saidthe man flying the glider had put himself ""in grave danger""by breaching an air exclusion zone around the course. In July the Treasury said it would fund policing costs of up toÂ£5m for police operations during Mr Trump's visit to his Scottish golf course. Before Mr Trump's visit to the UK the Police Federation said it would put ""unquestionable pressure"" on UK police forces. Essex Police Assistant Chief Constable Pippa Mills apologised for the conditions that extra officers were expected to sleep in after pictures posted on social media showed rows of camp beds in a gymnasium.

In her blog post, Chief Constable Thornton said financial issues dominated a meeting of the Chief Constables' Council this week. A recent Treasury announcement flagging up a likely increase to employee pension contributions meant forces in England and Wales might need to find an extra Â£417m by 2020/21, she said. ""This is equivalent to nearly 10,000 officers and grave concern was expressed about further reducing the sustainability of local police forces,"" she said. ""There was general concern about the strain that forces are currently under and the impact on core policing such as answering emergency calls, investigating crime and neighbourhood policing."" The pensions matter had been raised with the government, while force chiefs were working with police and crime commissioners to build a case for increased resources in the next spending review, she added.

Stars' #MeToo fund gives Â£1m to UK victimsFunds raised in response to sexual harassment scandals will help women's groups across the UK.UK,"Actress Emma Watson has donated a large sum to the fund A fund set up by British celebrities in response to the #MeToo movement has given more than Â£1m to women's groups across the UK. The Justice and Equality Fund has been backed by stars including Emma Watson, Keira Knightley and Jodie Whittaker. The first grants were given to seven UK organisations which help women who have suffered sexual harassment and abuse. Harry Potter star Watson,who donated Â£1m to the fund earlier this year, said it was ""just the beginning"". She added that the grants were ""pivotal in supporting the dynamic work of vital UK women's organisations"". Almost exactly a year after the first #MeToo tweet - the Justice and Equality Fund awarded Â£1,027,699 to seven women's organisations in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. These were the first grants to be awarded from the fund. The next recipients will be announced in November. The Women's Aid Federation in Northern Ireland will receive Â£200,000 to re-establish a pilot rape crisis service there after a 12-year gap. Knightley said: ""To be able to fund the first rape crisis service provision in Northern Ireland for 12 years feels like a huge step forward."" ""I hope we can continue to raise funds to support more of the front-line organisations doing such critical work with women and girls across the UK."" Other organisations receiving grants include: Nearly Â£200,000 to Rights Of Women, for a free, confidential helpline led by female lawyers offering specialist legal advice More than Â£88,000 to Welsh Women's Aid to provide training in women's support services across Wales More than Â£130,000 to London Black Women's Project, providing specialist advice to black and minority ethnic and migrant women Knightley was among British and Irish stars to sign an open letter calling for an end to sexual harassment at work Samantha Rennie, executive director of the charity Rosa, which manages the Justice and Equality Fund, said the grants would ensure ""no-one is left unsupported when they have been harassed"". ""We're delighted that so many individuals and Time's Up have reached out in solidarity to make this happen. ""But we need to do more - to get these services on a stable footing - and tackle the culture that means abusers can act with impunity."" What has #MeToo actually changed? Why women fear a backlash over #MeToo Has #MeToo divided women? The #MeToo movement began with a tweet by actress Alyssa Milano in October 2017 after dozens of women came forward to accuse Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment, abuse or rape. The Hollywood-based Time's Up project - and its British arm, Time's Up UK - followed, with more than 300 actresses, writers and directors raising money to support women who have been victims of sexual harassment and assault in the workplace.

Breaking|Breaking newsAstronauts escape malfunctioning rocketAstronauts to make emergency landing after their Russian Soyuz rocket malfunctioned on lift-off to space stationEurope,"This video can not be played The booster failure became apparent about 90 seconds into the October flight A US astronaut and a Russian cosmonaut were forced to make an emergency landing after their Russian Soyuz rocket malfunctioned en route to the International Space Station (ISS). Shortly after taking off from Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan, Nick Hague and Alexey Ovchinin reported a problem with the rocket's booster. The men were forced into a ""ballistic descent"", with their capsule landing a few hundred miles north of Baikonur. They have been picked up by rescuers. ""The search and recovery teams have reached the Soyuz spacecraft landing site and report that the two crew members... are in good condition and are out of the capsule,"" US space agency Nasa said. Russia said it was suspending any further manned flights, and an investigation into what went wrong had begun. The launch appeared to be going smoothly, but some 90 seconds later Nasa, on its livestream, reported that a problem seemed to have occurred with the booster rocket between the first and second stages of separation. Footage from inside the capsule showed the two men being shaken around at the moment that the fault happened. Shortly afterwards, Nasa said they were making a ""ballistic descent"" meaning their capsule descended at a much sharper angle than normal and would have been subjected to greater G-force - the force imposed on a body by rapid acceleration. The capsule separated from the failing rocket and later deployed parachutes to slow its descent. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

By Jonathan Amos, BBC science correspondent Soyuz is one of the oldest rocket designs but also one of the safest. The malfunction appeared to occur around what is termed ""staging"", where the ascending vehicle goes through the process of discarding its empty fuel segments. The onboard astronauts were certainly aware that something was not right because they reported feeling weightless when they should have felt pushed back in their seats. The escape systems are tested and ready for exactly this sort of eventuality. It would have been an uncomfortable ride back to Earth, however. The crew would have experienced very sharp accelerations and  decelerations on the return. There is already much discussion about the current state of Russian industry and its ability to maintain the standards of yesteryear. Whatever the outcome of the inquiry, this event will only heighten those concerns and will underline to the US in particular the need to bring online new rocket systems. These vehicles, produced by the Boeing and SpaceX companies, are set to make their debut next year. They seem to have been unharmed by the experience. Search and rescue teams were quickly on the scene, 500km (310 miles) north-east of Baikonur, near the Kazakh city of Dzhezkazgan. They reported that Mr Hague and Mr Ovchinin were alive and well and the Russian civilian space agency, Roscosmos, later issued photos of them having their hearts and blood pressure monitored. ""The emergency rescue system worked, the vessel was able to land in Kazakhstan... the crew are alive,"" Roscosmos tweeted. Nasa described them as being in good condition. They reportedly did not need medical treatment. Nasa added that the two men were being taken to the Gagarin Cosmonaut Training Centre outside Moscow,external, and it was ""monitoring the situation carefully"".

Tim Peake special: How to be an astronaut Russia's Deputy Prime Minister Yuri Borisov said no further manned missions would take place ""until we believe that the entire situation guarantees safety"". He rejected suggestions it could harm US relations, saying they recognised it was a ""hi-tech industry linked to risk"", but he added: ""We certainly won't conceal the reasons, it is uncommon for such situations"". Space co-operation is an area which has survived otherwise tense relations between Russia and the US. Nasa has been paying for seats on Soyuz rockets to ferry its astronauts to the International Space Station since the Space Shuttle programme ended in 2011. The crew already on the ISS will not be affected by Thursday's aborted mission, Russia's Tass news agency reported, quoting an unnamed source as saying they have enough supplies. Thursday's incident is thought to be the first launch mishap for a Russian Soyuz booster since a Soyuz mission was aborted in 1983. A rocket malfunctioned shortly before launch, and the crew vehicle was ejected to safety. In recent years, Russia's space programme has faced a number of technical failures - 13 since 2010. Last year, contact was lost with a Soyuz rocket's Fregat upper stage, which was carrying a new weather satellite and 18 secondary satellites. Earlier in 2017, at least nine of a payload of 73 satellites were reported ""dead on arrival or severely degraded"" after separation from their Soyuz-2.1 launch vehicle. In August, a hole appeared in a Soyuz capsule already docked to the ISS which caused a brief loss of air pressure and had to be patched. In this instance,Russia said the hole may have been drilled ""deliberately"". One of the most serious but non-fatal US incidents involved Apollo 13 - a mission to the Moon in 1970.

"'Flexitarian' diets can limit future risksEating more plant-based foods, ending waste and improving farming are vital for the future, say scientistsScience & Environment","Increased production of fruit and vegetables will be needed if diets change If the world wants to limit climate change, water scarcity and pollution, then we all need to embrace ""flexitarian"" diets, say scientists. This means eating mainly plant-based foods, and is one of three key steps towards a sustainable future for all in 2050, they say. Food waste will need to be halved and farming practices will also have to improve,according to the study,external. Without action, the impacts of the food system could increase by up to 90%. Fast on the heels of the landmark report of the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC) comes this new study on how food production and consumption impact major threats to the planet. Final call to halt 'climate catastrophe' Q&A: Climate change - your questions answered Five things we have learned from the IPCC report The authors say that the food system has a number of significant environmental impacts including being a major driver of climate change, depleting freshwater and pollution through excessive use of nitrogen and phosphorous. This video can not be played Dr Marco Springmann tells Today eating only one portion of red meat a week could help tackle global warming The study says that thanks to the population and income growth expected between 2010 and 2050, these impacts could grow between 50-90%. This could push our world beyond its planetary boundaries, which the authors say represent a ""safe operating space for humanity on a stable Earth system"". However the study finds that no single solution will avert the dangers, so a combined approach is needed. So when it comes to climate change, the authors looked at what they called a ""flexitarian diet"". ""We can eat a range of healthy diets but what they all have in common, according to the latest scientific evidence, is that they are all relatively plant based,"" said lead author Dr Marco Springmann from the University of Oxford. ""You can go from a diet that has small amounts of animal products, some might call it a Mediterranean based diet, we call it a flexitarian diet, over to a pescatarian, vegetarian or vegan diet - we tried to stay with the most conservative one of these which in our view is the flexitarian one, but even this has only one serving of red meat per week."" Improved farming techniques and reduced use of fertiliser will be required If the world moved to this type of diet, the study found that greenhouse gas emissions from agriculture would be reduced by more than half. But as well as altering diets, the research says that farming practices need to change significantly. This involves boosting yields from existing cropland, improving water management and restricting and recycling fertiliser use. ""We looked at improving agricultural yields in particular of more health sensitive crops like fruit, vegetables and legumes,"" said Dr Springmann. ""In the past there has been lots of invest in the stable grains like maize and corn, but now we really need to move it to the crops we need more of. We also looked at increasing the efficiency of water use, and we looked at better monitoring and recycling of fertiliser - lots of it is lost and it runs off into rivers and causes dead zones in the oceans."" In addition, the study found that halving the amount of food lost to waste would reduce the environmental impacts of agriculture by 16%. Cutting down on food waste will be key to reducing the environmental impacts of farming ""Tackling food loss and waste will require measures across the entire food chain, from storage, and transport, over food packaging and labelling to changes in legislation and business behaviour that promote zero-waste supply chains,"" said Fabrice de Clerck, director of science atEAT,externalwho funded the study. The key element is that these three solutions must be implemented together. ""Feeding a world population of 10 billion people is possible - yet only if we change the way we eat, and the way we produce food,"" said Johan RockstrÃ¶m, director designate of the Potsdam Institute for Climate Impact Research, who is one of the authors of the study. ""All measures combined can result in keeping healthy both planet and people."" The study has been published in the journal Nature.

Skateboard hero to receive bravery awardIgnacio EcheverrÃÂ­a died trying to help a woman who had been stabbed during the London Bridge attack.UK,"The parents of a Spanish banker who was killed confronting terrorists during the London Bridge attack have accepted a civilian medal on his behalf. Wielding only his skateboard, Ignacio EcheverrÃ­a, 39, tried to fight off one of the terrorists who killed eight people on 3 June last year. His parents were presented with the George Medal during a ceremony at Buckingham Palace on Thursday. Two police officers also received the same award for their actions. At the ceremony his father JoaquÃ­n EcheverrÃ­a Alonso said it was a ""special moment but very emotional"" for him and his wife Miralles De Imperial Hornedo. He said the award helped ""recognise the courage of my son"". ""Since Ignacio's death we have lived a year of intense emotions,"" he said. ""There has been pain and love and I have reflected on the meaning of duty and commitment. ""I have been compelled to think about what really matters and what is worth taking risks and fighting for; life, freedom, dignity, for oneself and for others."" Ignacio had been working for HSBC as part of the bank's team fighting money laundering Mr EcheverrÃ­a Alonso said his son was ""committed to helping others"" and his bravery on the day was not just a spur of the moment decision. He told the BBC that Ignacio had said he would have intervened if he had been passing the Westminster Bridge attack which happened three months earlier. ""Ignacio told us that if he had have been skateboarding past on that occasion then the police officer would have survived, because he would have tried to help. ""Later, during the attack at London Bridge, he demonstrated this through his actions."" Eight people were killed in the London Bridge attack Three men drove a van into pedestrians on London Bridgebefore launching a knife attack in Borough Marketlast year. They killedeight people. Mr Alonso said: ""When terrorists attack someone they attack our entire way of life. ""They manipulate words and minds and try and convince us that they have acted in the name of a cause. ""So when Ignacio is recognised with an award, it represents the opposite of all of that."" He said he was grateful to be receiving the George Medal on his son's behalf because it showed the UK considered his actions to be ""important"". PC Charles Guenigault and PC Wayne Marqueswere also given the bravery award. PC Leon McLeod was awarded the Queen's Gallantry Medal for running at the terrorists and then providing aid to victims following the attack. The award was created in September 1940 under the reign of King George VI, initially to reward acts of civilian courage and bravery during the Blitz. Since then it has been awarded more than 2,000 times, and some military personnel have received it for ""gallant conduct that is not in the face of the enemy"". Posthumous recipients of themedal include PC Keith Palmer,who was fatally stabbed outside the Houses of Parliament in March 2017 during the Westminster terror attack.

Public faces 'care injustice' as NHS struggles,"The public is facing a growing ""care injustice"" as people are finding it more difficult to get help in England, the regulator is warning. The Care Quality Commission highlighted growing hospital waiting lists, delays at A&E and record dissatisfaction levels with GPs in its annual report. Mental health and old-age care were also becoming harder to access. And the report said even where there was care available many people only had the choice of failing services. In its 130-page review, the regulator pointed to the lack of out-of-hours GP care rising rates of preventable admissions to hospitals overcrowding on wards and worsening A&E waiting times the growing waiting list for routine operations mental health patients being made to travel long distances for treatment older people going without the help they need for daily tasks such as washing and dressing Don Redding, of the patient group, National Voices, said it was clear the system was ""malfunctioning"" and the report should act as a ""loud alarm bell"". He urged the government and NHS leaders to take notice as they prepare to publish their 10-year NHS plan later in the autumn, setting out how the extra funding for the health service will be spent in the coming years. The report is being published as the BBC relaunches its NHS Tracker project, which enables users to find out how their local areas are performing on cancer, A&E, hospital care and mental health services.  The CQC is particularly worried about four areas of the country where access to good hospital and social care is problematic. These have been named as the Isle of Wight, Kent, Wirral and Portsmouth. People in these areas are hit by both struggling hospitals and poorer-than-average care services, with inspectors worried things are not going to get better in the future. In Kent there are seven local hospitals that are all judged to be not good enough, while one in three nursing homes is failing. The Isle of Wight's only hospital has an inadequate rating and a third of care homes are failing. In Wirral, half the nursing homes are judged not good enough along with the two local hospitals, while nearly half of home care services in Portsmouth and its main hospital are not up to scratch. No. Overall, the CQC said the majority of services were rated as good or outstanding and the quality of care was being maintained. In fact, on each measure, there has been a small increase in the number of good and outstanding performers on the year before. However, that should not be interpreted as a definitive sign of improvement. The CQC prioritises the worst-performing services for reinspection which means the overall picture is more likely to improve than deteriorate, because the poorest performers cannot get a lower rating. Instead, the problem being highlighted is more a matter of it getting harder to access services. People are waiting longer for treatment, going without or - in the case of mental health care - sometimes having to travel long distances for treatment. It is a simple matter of supply and demand. The ageing population and rise in illnesses such as diabetes means more and more people need care. While the NHS budget has been rising, it has not been enough to keep up with the growing numbers of people needing treatment. There are shortages of staff in key areas - 12% of nurse posts and 9% of doctor posts are vacant. But the CQC is also clear there is a structural problem. The nature of illness, which means people rely on ongoing care for incurable conditions like dementia, is placing a greater reliance on the way the NHS works with care services, such as nursing homes and help in the home for tasks such as washing and dressing. Care services are organised by councils or rely on people paying for it privately. It has created a situation where growing numbers are simply going without help in their later years. The CQC pointed to figures showing the numbers not receiving the care they need has increased nearly a fifth in two years to 1.4 million - that is nearly one in seven older people. Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said it has got so bad that it has become ""pot luck"" whether you can get help. The Department of Health and Social Care said action is being taken. It pointed to the increased funding for the NHS that was announced by the prime minister in the summer. That will mean by 2023 the budget will have risen by more than Â£20bn a year in real terms. There is also a big emphasis being placed on the NHS to work closely with care services. On top of this, ministers have promised to reform the funding system for social care, with a Green Paper expected to be published later this year. A spokesman added: ""We want the NHS to be the safest healthcare system in the world - and this starts by ensuring every single patient in this country receives the highest quality of care, no matter where they live.""

UK #MeToo fund donates ÃÂ£1m to help victims,"Actress Emma Watson has donated a large sum to the fund A fund set up by British celebrities in response to the #MeToo movement has given more than Â£1m to women's groups across the UK. The Justice and Equality Fund has been backed by stars including Emma Watson, Keira Knightley and Jodie Whittaker. The first grants were given to seven UK organisations which help women who have suffered sexual harassment and abuse. Harry Potter star Watson,who donated Â£1m to the fund earlier this year, said it was ""just the beginning"". She added that the grants were ""pivotal in supporting the dynamic work of vital UK women's organisations"". Almost exactly a year after the first #MeToo tweet - the Justice and Equality Fund awarded Â£1,027,699 to seven women's organisations in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. These were the first grants to be awarded from the fund. The next recipients will be announced in November. The Women's Aid Federation in Northern Ireland will receive Â£200,000 to re-establish a pilot rape crisis service there after a 12-year gap. Knightley said: ""To be able to fund the first rape crisis service provision in Northern Ireland for 12 years feels like a huge step forward."" ""I hope we can continue to raise funds to support more of the front-line organisations doing such critical work with women and girls across the UK.""

Man charged over US elections 'bomb plot',"The National Mall is located in central Washington DC A man who planned to blow himself up in Washington DC on the day of next month's mid-term elections has been held and charged, US prosecutors say. They say Paul Rosenfeld, 56, built a 200lb (91kg) explosive device and wanted to detonate it on the National Mall in the capital on 6 November. They say he wanted to draw attention to his belief in ""sortition"" - a political theory that advocates the random selection of government officials. He could be jailed for 20 years. A really simple guide to US mid-term elections Mr Rosenfeld - who waived his right to remain silent - was charged with two counts of manufacturing and transporting explosives on Wednesday, the prosecutors say. ""Had he been successful, Rosenfeld's alleged plot could have claimed the lives of innocent bystanders and caused untold destruction,"" said Assistant Director-in-Charge William Sweeney of the New York Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). ""Fortunately, his plans were thwarted by the quick action of a concerned citizen and the diligent work of a host of our law enforcement partners and the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force,"" he added. Law enforcement agents say the huge explosive device was found at the suspect's home in Tappan, New York state, on 9 October. This came after an individual had received letters and text messages from the suspect about the plot, and had alerted the authorities. Mr Rosenfeld later admitted that he had ordered large quantities of black powder, an explosive substance, on the internet and had conducted test detonations, the prosecutors say.

Standing desks 'boost work performance',"New research suggests that standing desks, which allow employees to alter their position during the day, may boost performance at work. A number of NHS staff were given new desks and set goals for standing time. After a year, researchers found sitting time was reduced by more than an hour a day compared with their colleagues. Employees who reduced time sitting, by using desks that also allowed them to work while on their feet, also said they were less tired and more engaged. Could offices change from sitting to standing? The research team, led by Loughborough University and experts from Leicester, assessed 146 mainly sedentary NHS staff. Seventy-seven were put in an intervention group and given height-adjustable workstations - also known as sit-stand desks - while the remaining 69 continued with their standard desks. Working time spent sitting was measured at the start of the study and again three, six and 12 months later. At the start of the study, overall sitting time was 9.7 hours per day. Over the course of the experiment, sitting time was lower by 50.62 minutes per day at three months, 64.4 minutes per day at six months, and 82.39 minutes per day at 12 months. Those who were given sit-stand desks also reported improvements in musculoskeletal problems, according to the research published in the British Medical Journal (BMJ). A questionnaire filled out by the participants also suggested employees who used the sit-stand desks were less anxious and cited an improved quality of life - but no notable changes were found for job satisfaction, cognitive function or sickness absence. Medical research has suggested constant sitting is harming our health - potentially causing cardiovascular problems or vulnerability to diabetes. A survey by the British Heart Foundation in 2015found that the average person sat for almost all of the nine hours spent in the office. But it's not the case everywhere. In Sweden, sit-stand working is commonplace - and in 2014, Denmark made it mandatory for employers to offer their staff sit-stand desks. However, the authors of the report say more research is needed to gauge the longer-term benefits. The risks of sitting all day long.

She added that the grants were ""pivotal in supporting the dynamic work of vital UK women's organisations"". Almost exactly a year after the first #MeToo tweet - the Justice and Equality Fund awarded Â£1,027,699 to seven women's organisations in England, Scotland, Northern Ireland and Wales. These were the first grants to be awarded from the fund. The next recipients will be announced in November. The Women's Aid Federation in Northern Ireland will receive Â£200,000 to re-establish a pilot rape crisis service there after a 12-year gap. Knightley said: ""To be able to fund the first rape crisis service provision in Northern Ireland for 12 years feels like a huge step forward."" ""I hope we can continue to raise funds to support more of the front-line organisations doing such critical work with women and girls across the UK."" Other organisations receiving grants include: Nearly Â£200,000 to Rights Of Women, for a free, confidential helpline led by female lawyers offering specialist legal advice More than Â£88,000 to Welsh Women's Aid to provide training in women's support services across Wales More than Â£130,000 to London Black Women's Project, providing specialist advice to black and minority ethnic and migrant women Knightley was among British and Irish stars to sign an open letter calling for an end to sexual harassment at work Samantha Rennie, executive director of the charity Rosa, which manages the Justice and Equality Fund, said the grants would ensure ""no-one is left unsupported when they have been harassed"". ""We're delighted that so many individuals and Time's Up have reached out in solidarity to make this happen. ""But we need to do more - to get these services on a stable footing - and tackle the culture that means abusers can act with impunity."" What has #MeToo actually changed? Why women fear a backlash over #MeToo Has #MeToo divided women? The #MeToo movement began with a tweet by actress Alyssa Milano in October 2017 after dozens of women came forward to accuse Hollywood producer Harvey Weinstein of sexual harassment, abuse or rape. The Hollywood-based Time's Up project - and its British arm, Time's Up UK - followed, with more than 300 actresses, writers and directors raising money to support women who have been victims of sexual harassment and assault in the workplace.

DUP 'could oppose Budget' over Brexit dealThe Northern Ireland party says it will oppose any new barriers with Great Britain after Brexit.UK PoliticsComments,"DUP leader Arlene Foster met EU negotiator Michel Barnier on Tuesday The Democratic Unionist Party's 10 Westminster MPs are planning to vote down the Budget later this month if they are unhappy about the government's Brexit plans, the BBC understands. Theresa May relies on DUP support in key votes because she does not have a majority in the House of Commons. But the DUP could abandon this deal if Brexit means new barriers between Northern Ireland and Great Britain, Newsnight's Nick Watt said. The Budget takes place on 29 October. If the DUP voted against it the government would face possible defeat, which could lead to a no-confidence vote. Earlier it abstained - rather than backing the government - in a vote on the Agriculture Bill in what a DUP source said was a ""warning shot"". Brexit negotiators working 'day and night' Prime Minister's Questions: The verdict Reality Check- Red lines on the Irish border The UK and the EU have yet to strike a deal on how Brexit will work, with less than six months to go before the UK leaves on 29 March. One of the key things they have not yet agreed is how to prevent there being new border checks between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland, which is a member of the EU. There have been warnings that a new ""hard border"" will damage businesses and undermine peace in Northern Ireland. The DUP has dismissed the warnings about the peace process. It says it will not tolerate the EU's suggestion of Northern Ireland staying in line with EU customs rules to enable trade to flow freely across the border. Allow Twitter content?

Mrs May has also rejected this proposal, saying it would undermine the integrity of the UK. Visiting the European Parliament, DUP leader Arlene Foster refused to say whether her MPs would vote against the Budget after being asked several times by reporters. She reiterated that she would not accept any new barriers to trade going in either direction between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK. EU chief negotiator Michel Barnier, meanwhile, said there would have to be new checks on goods travelling between the EU and the UK because of the UK's decision to leave the EU's single market and customs union. The EU and UK have agreed that these checks ""cannot be performed at the border"" and the EU proposes to carry them out ""in the least intrusive way possible"", he said. ""Both the EU and UK exclude having a physical border on the island of Ireland,"" he said. ""Therefore, what will arrive into Northern Ireland will also be arriving in our single market. ""There will be administrative procedures that do not exist today for goods travelling to Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. Our challenge is to make sure those procedures are as easy as possible and not too burdensome, in particular for smaller businesses. ""I understand why such procedures are politically sensitive but... Brexit was not our choice, it is the choice of the UK. Our proposal tries to help the UK in managing the negative fallout of Brexit in Northern Ireland in a way that respects the territorial integrity of the UK."" He said that under the EU's proposed ""backstop"" to prevent a hard border, companies in the rest of the UK sending goods to Northern Ireland would fill out customs declarations online in advance. ""The only visible systematic checks between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK would involve scanning the bar codes on lorries and containers, which could be done on ferries and at transit ports,"" he said. While regulatory checks on industrial goods could be done at company premises, checks on live animals and animal products had to happen at the border, he said, which would mean a ""significant increase in terms of scale"" to existing checks. Newsnight political editor Nick Watt Losing a budget vote has traditionally been seen as a withdrawal of confidence in the government. One former Tory cabinet minister told Newsnight: ""The DUP should be putting the fear of God into Downing St."" The DUP is growing alarmed because it fears Downing St is edging towards a deal with the EU that may lead to additional regulatory checks on goods travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Michel Barnier, the EU's chief negotiator, has called for such checks to avoid creating a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. This would be achieved by aligning Northern Ireland with the rules of the single market. The prime minister has strongly rejected the Barnier plan. But senior DUP sources fear that Downing Street may agree to some form of regulatory checks. One DUP source told Newsnight: ""If we are not happy with what happens next week [in Brussels] we won't be bounced into anything. If she doesn't take our concerns on board, we will take the view that Theresa May is not the leader to take us through to a safe Brexit."" Read Nick's blog On Twitter former foreign secretary Boris Johnson, one of the leading critics of Theresa May's Brexit strategy, responded to reports of a new ""backstop"" arrangement being negotiated between the UK and the EU. It would make the UK ""a permanent EU colony"" with ""no right to escape"" from the EU's single market and customs union, he claimed. Allow Twitter content?

But Mel Stride, the financial secretary to the Treasury, told the BBC the government had a ""very strong position"" that there would be ""no border down the Irish Sea"". He predicted the UK was heading for a deal with the EU and would be keeping the DUP ""on board"". ""There is no difference between our position on the substantive issue,"" he added.

"Man charged over US elections 'bomb plot'The suspect wanted to detonate a 200lb (91kg) explosive device in Washington DC, US prosecutors say.US & Canada","The National Mall is located in central Washington DC A man who planned to blow himself up in Washington DC on the day of next month's mid-term elections has been held and charged, US prosecutors say. They say Paul Rosenfeld, 56, built a 200lb (91kg) explosive device and wanted to detonate it on the National Mall in the capital on 6 November. They say he wanted to draw attention to his belief in ""sortition"" - a political theory that advocates the random selection of government officials. He could be jailed for 20 years. A really simple guide to US mid-term elections Mr Rosenfeld - who waived his right to remain silent - was charged with two counts of manufacturing and transporting explosives on Wednesday, the prosecutors say. ""Had he been successful, Rosenfeld's alleged plot could have claimed the lives of innocent bystanders and caused untold destruction,"" said Assistant Director-in-Charge William Sweeney of the New York Office of the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI). ""Fortunately, his plans were thwarted by the quick action of a concerned citizen and the diligent work of a host of our law enforcement partners and the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force,"" he added. Law enforcement agents say the huge explosive device was found at the suspect's home in Tappan, New York state, on 9 October. This came after an individual had received letters and text messages from the suspect about the plot, and had alerted the authorities. Mr Rosenfeld later admitted that he had ordered large quantities of black powder, an explosive substance, on the internet and had conducted test detonations, the prosecutors say.

"Dad 'posed in KKK robes with baby Adolf'Adam Thomas, 22, wore the hooded uniform of the group for a picture with his newborn, a court hears.Oxford","Adam Thomas and Claudia Patatas gave their child the middle name Adolf, a court has heard An alleged far-right terrorist who named his child after Hitler posed with the newborn while clad in the white robes of the Ku Klux Klan (KKK), a court heard. Prosecutors say Adam Thomas, 22, and Claudia Patatas, 38, gave their baby the middle name Adolf in honour of the Nazi leader. The pair are charged alongside Daniel Bogunovic, 27, with being members of banned neo-Nazi group National Action All three deny being in the group. Jurors at Birmingham Crown Court previously heard Ms Patatas and Mr Thomas' child - who was given the middle name Adolf - appeared in a picture alongside ""vehement racist"" Darren Fletcher. On the second day of the trial, the court was shown a picture of a man in hooded white robes cradling a baby. Barnaby Jameson QC, prosecuting, said: ""The suggestion is that is Mr Thomas and his child, whose middle name is Adolf."" He said another image from the ""Thomas-Patatas family album"" showed the defendant, again wearing the signature uniform of the white supremacist US group, brandishing a machete in front of a Confederate flag. It was shown hanging over a sofa, next to two cushions emblazoned with the Swastika. Mr Jameson said the couple also had a poster stuck to their fridge reading ""Britain is ours - the rest must go"". Jurors were also told Ms Patatas, of Banbury, sent a WhatsApp message to convicted National Action member Fletcher, declaring: ""All Jews must be put to death"". Outlining further mobile phone evidence, Mr Jameson read a message apparently sent from Thomas to Patatas in September 2017. In it, he used racial slurs to to describe black and Asian colleagues, describing one as ""half-bred"" and one as a ""mongrel"". ""What I've found is that all non-whites are intolerable but the ones who have lived here most of their lives are even worse,"" the court heard. ""They have a more thuggery attitude about them as opposed to the sterotypical childish African."" Ms Patatas sent offensive messages on WhatsApp, the court heard An inspection of the defendants' mobile devices also found Ms Patatas had a photograph of National Action co-founder Benjamin Raymond stored on hers, Mr Jameson said. Mr Thomas, meanwhile, had an image depicting the ""burning cross symbol of the KKK"", he said. The prosecutor also alleged Mr Bogunovic's phone contained an image of a March 2017 press report detailing how National Action was secretly reforming. Mr Jameson said the group had tried to ""shed one skin for another"" in order to evade the law, and questioned whether Mr Bogunovic's interest in the relaunch stemmed from his heavy involvement in it. Jurors were also told the defendants formed a new group named the TripleK Mafia - a reference to the KKK - after National Action was banned in 2016. However, it was repeatedly misspelt ""TrippleK"" on posters by fellow member Joel Wilmore, Mr Jameson said. The prosecutor then showed jurors an example of the typographical error. Wilmore, 24, of Bramhall Moor Lane, Stockport, has since admitted terrorist group membership. Opening the case on Tuesday, Mr Jameson said it detailed a ""cult of violent white racial supremacy"" which regarded groups including black, Jewish, Asian and gay people as ""sub-human"". ""It is a terror that can be summarised in two words: white Jihad - in other words, a white holy war,"" he said. Ms Patatas and Mr Thomas, both of Waltham Gardens, Banbury, and Bogunovic, of Crowns Hills Rise, Leicester deny being members of a banned group. Mr Thomas further denies a separate charge of having a copy of terrorist document, The Anarchist Cookbook, which contained bomb-making instructions. The trial continues.
