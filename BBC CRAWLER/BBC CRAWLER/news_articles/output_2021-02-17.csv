Lord Frost to join cabinet in Brexit role,"Boris Johnson has drafted former Brexit negotiator Lord David Frost into his cabinet to take charge of forging a new relationship with the EU. He will seek to maximise post-Brexit trading opportunities when he becomes a full cabinet member next month, Downing Street said. He will also replace Michael Gove as co-chair of a committee on implementing the Brexit withdrawal deal. Mr Gove will keep his seat at the cabinet table. No 10 replaces Frost as National Security Adviser Frost: UK relations with EU 'more than bumpy' Can the Northern Ireland Protocol be tweaked? The change means Mr Gove, who will keep the title of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, will be Lord Frost's new boss at the Cabinet Office. The peer said Mr Gove had done an ""extraordinary job for this country"" in talks with the EU over the past year. In taking over from him as chair of the EU-UK committee tasked with implementing the Brexit deal, he said: ""I stand on the shoulders of giants."" Labour's shadow international trade secretary Emily Thornberry tweeted: ""So we've finally got one minister taking a grip of the problems with our post-Brexit trading relationships with Europe. ""Someone who has never been elected by anyone in this country, and won't be accountable in the House of Commons to any of us who have."" This appointment again shows that Brexit didn't end with the signing of a trade deal. While the UK is no longer a member of the EU, negotiating with Brussels and member states will preoccupy this and future governments for years to come. Since the start of the year (and the end of the transition period) serious tensions have flared up between Westminster and Brussels over trade disruption between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and vaccine supplies. Other issues, such as the City of London's access to EU markets, remain unresolved. Lord Frost will now be the UK minister responsible for co-ordinating all this and it will be a full time job. Rather than responsibility for the EU being shared between several departments - such as the Foreign Office and International Trade - the decision to put Lord Frost in the cabinet and in charge of the Withdrawal Agreement Joint Committee gives him huge clout overseeing policy. It also takes a lot of work away from Michael Gove and means there will be a single minister responsible to parliament for EU relations - although of course he'll be answering questions in the House of Lords and not the Commons. Speaking last week to a select committee, Lord Frost said the UK's relationship with the EU since the trade deal between the two came into force at the start of the year, had been more ""problematic"" and ""bumpy"" than he had expected. He said he hoped we would ""get over this"", but added that it was going to require a ""different spirit"" from Brussels. Lord Frost - who is said to be highly rated by the prime minister - had been due to become the UK's new national security adviser earlier this month, but was replaceddays before he was due to start. He will be the co-chair of the UK-EU joint committee, which was set up to resolve differences arising from the treaty which took the UK out of the EU in February 2020. Since the UK left its Brexit transition period in January, this committee has mainly focused on overcoming trade tensions in Northern Ireland. Unlike the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland is continuing to follow EU single market rules on goods. This provision, agreed as part of the withdrawal agreement, was designed to get rid of the need for checks at the border with the Republic of Ireland. But it has meant checks had to be introduced on some goods travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Since the new rules came into force, there has been tensions at ports in Northern Ireland, with disruption to some food supplies and online deliveries. Lord Frost will also become UK chair of a separate committee being set up to oversee the post-Brexit trade deal he negotiated with Brussels last year. Can the Northern Ireland Protocol be tweaked?

Facebook blocks news content in Australia,"This video can not be played Australians react to Facebook's news ban (18 February) Facebook has blocked Australian users from sharing or viewing news content on the platform, causing much alarm over public access to key information. It comes in response to a proposed law which would make tech giants pay for news content on their platforms. Australians on Thursday woke up to find that Facebook pages of all local and global news sites were unavailable. Several government health and emergency pages were also blocked  - something Facebook later asserted was a mistake. Those outside of the country are also unable to read or access any Australian news publications on the platform. The Australian government has strongly criticised the move, saying it demonstrated the ""immense market power of these digital social giants"". Treasurer Josh Frydenberg said the ban on news information had a ""huge community impact"". About 17 million Australians visit the social media site every month. Australia vs tech firms: Whatâs this row about? News publishers fight tech giants for better deals Could Google really leave Australia? He said the government was committed to passing the law, and ""we would like to see them [Facebook] in Australia. ""But I think their actions today were unnecessary and wrong,"" he added. Google and Facebook have fought the law because they say it doesn't reflect how the internet works, and unfairly ""penalises"" their platforms. However, in contrast to Facebook, Google has in recent days signed payment deals with three major Australian media outlets. Facebook's action came just hours afterGoogle agreed to pay Rupert Murdoch's News Corp for content from news sites across its media empire. Australian authorities haddrawn up the laws to ""level the playing field"" between the tech giants and struggling publishersover profits. Of every A$100 (Â£56; $77) spent on digital advertising in Australian media these days, A$81 goes to Google and Facebook. But Facebook said the law left it ""facing a stark choice: attempt to comply with a law that ignores the realities of this relationship, or stop allowing news content on our services in Australia"". ""With a heavy heart, we are choosing the latter,"",externalit said in a blog post. Facebook said it was making the change ""with a heavy heart"" The law sought ""to penalise Facebook for content it didn't take or ask for"", the company's local managing director William Easton said. Facebook said it helped Australian publishers earn about A$407m (Â£228m;$316m) last year through referrals, but for itself ""the platform gain from news is minimal"". Under the ban, Australian publishers are also restricted from sharing or posting any links on their Facebook pages. The national broadcaster, the ABC, and newspapers like The Sydney Morning Herald and The Australian have millions of followers. Facebook's change also denied Australians access to many key government agencies, including police and emergency services, health departments and the Bureau of Meteorology. The ban is also affecting official government pages Other pages for charities, politicians, sports groups and other non-news organisations were also affected. Facebook later released a statement which said these pages had been ""inadvertently impacted"" and would be reinstated, though it did not give a deadline. A spokesperson said the company had ""taken a broad definition"" of the term ""news content"" in the law. The ban sparked an immediate backlash, with many Australians angry about their sudden loss of access to trusted and authoritative sources. Several pointed out that Facebook was one crucial way that people received emergency updates about the pandemic and national disaster situations. Others raised concerns about misinformation now freely circulating on the site. ""It feels obviously very restrictive in what Facebook is going to allow people to do in the future, not only in Australia but around the world,"" Sydney man Peter Firth told the BBC. Amelia Marshall said she could not believe the firm's decision ""in the middle of a pandemic"", adding: ""I've made the long-overdue decision to permanently delete my Facebook account."" Human Rights Watch' Australia director said Facebook was censoring the flow of information in the country - calling it a ""dangerous turn of events"". ""Cutting off access to vital information to an entire country in the dead of the night is unconscionable,"" said Elaine Pearson. Australia's conservative government is standing by the law - which passed the lower house of parliament on Wednesday. It has broad cross-party support and will be debated again in parliament on Thursday. ""We will legislate this code. We want the digital giants paying traditional news media businesses for generating original journalistic content,"" said Treasurer Josh Frydenberg who added that ""the eyes of the world are watching what's happening here"". He said he'd also had a discussion with Facebook chief executive Mark Zuckerberg which had been ""constructive"". But he pointed out that Facebook, like Google, had been negotiating pay deals with local organisations. This banning action had ""come at an eleventh hour"" and damaged the site's reputation he said. ""What they're effectively saying to Australians is: ""You will not find content on our platform which comes from an organisation which employs professional journalists, which has editorial policies, which has fact-checking processes"". Australia is not a big market for Facebook. And Facebook says news isn't a big driver of revenue for the company. So why does it care so much about this law? This is far more about the principle. Other countries have been looking at what is happening in Australia. There's speculation that Canada, even the EU could follow Australia's lead - something Facebook wants to avoid. Facebook does already pay for some news. It's entered into commercial deals with media companies in the UK, for example. What Facebook wants to do, however, is call the shots. Its executives do not want governments to step in, telling them they have to pay for news - and even setting the price. Facebook, then, has decided to show that there are consequences for governments if they want to take muscular action against Big Tech. But that could backfire spectacularly. That Facebook can essentially switch off Australian news on its platform is already being criticised as anti-democratic - even authoritarian - in some quarters.

Grenfell cladding firm gave fire test 'half-truth',"The company that made the Grenfell Tower cladding told a ""misleading half-truth"" to a British standards board, its boss has accepted. Arconic only shared one successful fire test result with the British Board of AgrÃ©ment (BBA), and not a failed result, an inquiry into the fire heard. But Claude Schmidt, Arconic's president, denied the failed test was ""deliberately concealed"" by his firm. He said the BBA should have found the poor test result as part of an audit. The Grenfell Tower Inquiry is looking into how the west London tower block came to be covered in combustible materials, leading to the fire which killed 72 people in June 2017. Grenfell cladding boss says tests not 'priority' Fire brigade still to fix Grenfell failings Grenfell cladding company 'knew of fire risk' Arconic was awarded a product certificate for its Reynobond PE aluminium composite cladding in the UK by the BBA in 2008, opening up the possibility of more sales in the UK. However, Arconic's own fire tests of the product, years earlier, had produced very different outcomes. The first, on a version of the cladding designed to fit flat against the outside of a building, resulted in a class B rating, on a scale from A1 to F, where A1 is best. This result would have allowed it to have been used on high-rise buildings such as Grenfell Tower. The second test was carried out on a folded section of cladding, known in the industry as a ""cassette"". That test resulted in a class E rating as the cladding caught fire. When Arconic applied to the BBA for the certificate, the inquiry heard, it sent the results of the first test, but not the second, despite being asked to provide more evidence. The folded design was later chosen by designers for use on Grenfell Tower. The inquiry's lead counsel, Richard Millett QC, put it to Claude Schmidt that Arconic had a contractual requirement to provide all relevant information upfront. Mr Millett said the company had concealed the class E test, in which the cladding ""performed disastrously"" - which might have ""substantially affected sales of the product in the UK"". Speaking in French through an interpreter, Mr Schmidt said: ""I don't know why at the start that test wasn't mentioned... but it could have been found out, discovered in an audit."" Mr Millet asked if Mr Schmidt accepted that Arconic ""was telling the BBA a misleading half-truth"". ""Yes, you can see it like that,"" Mr Schmidt replied. Mr Schmidt accepted Mr Millett's suggestion that any user of Arconic's product would see the test result as ""absolutely crucial safety information"". But Arconic's president said it was ""too strong"" to describe the information as "" life-and-death stuff"". Documents presented to the inquiry show that negotiations with the BBA were led by a technical manager, Claude Wehrle. Mr Schmidt said: ""I can't know what Claude Wehrle was thinking about or reasoning at the time."" Mr Wehrle, a French national, hasrefused - despite repeated requests - to come to the inquiryto give evidence, because of legal advice he says he has received. The inquiry has the power to force British witnesses to give evidence, but not foreign nationals. Grenfell firm sold flammable cladding 'by default' Lies, sham tests & buck-passing - Grenfell's year of evidence Grenfell 'whistleblower' refusing to give evidence The issue of which standards the Arconic cladding met, and what testing was done on it, is at the centre of this phase of the public inquiry - and is an important component of the Metropolitan Police investigation. It is also one of the factors behind the building safety crisis affecting hundreds of thousands of people across the country. Immediately after the fire, residents of the Chalcots Estate in Camden, north London, had to leave their homes when the fire risk of Arconic Reynobond PE aluminium composite cladding was realised. Arconic's position has always been that it simply produced the raw materials for cladding systems, and it didn't necessarily know how they would be used, so could not know that they might not meet building regulations. Buton Tuesday, Mr Schmidt was askedby Mr Millett about ""occasions when Arconic did understand what project the product would be used for"". Asked whether Grenfell Tower was ""an example of that"", Mr Schmidt said: ""Yes."" The inquiry continues.

UN to raise Princess Latifa case with UAE,"This video can not be played Videos show Dubai's Princess Latifa in ""villa jail"" The United Nations has said it will raise the detention of Princess Latifa, the daughter of Dubai's ruler, with the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Princess Latifa has accused her father of holding her hostage in Dubai since she tried to flee the city in 2018. In secretly recorded videos shared with the BBC, Princess Latifa said she feared for her life. The footage prompted global calls for a UN investigation, while the UK said the videos were ""deeply troubling"". ""We are concerned about it,"" UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said on Wednesday. He said the videos showed ""a young woman in deep distress"", adding that the UK would watch any developments from the UN ""very closely"". This video can not be played ""I've seen some of the footage and it's deeply troubling"" â UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab But when asked whether sanctions could be imposed, Mr Raab said: ""It's not clear to me that there would be the evidence to support that."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson also said the government was ""concerned"" but would ""wait and see how [the UN] get on"" with their investigation. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has said it would soon question the UAE about Princess Latifa. ""We will certainly raise these new developments with the UAE,"" spokesman Rupert Colville said. ""Other parts of the UN human rights system with relevant mandates may also become involved once they have analysed the new material"". Meanwhile, a spokesman said the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention could launch an investigation once Princess Latifa's videos have been analysed. Dubai's Princess Latifa before her escape attempt in 2018 ""We are hoping [a UN investigation] will be decisive in finally getting Princess Latifa released,"" Rodney Dixon, a lawyer who presented the case to the UN, told the BBC. ""The UN needs to have a very serious meeting directly with those who are holding [her] and make sure an agreement is reached so she can be released,"" he said. Mr Dixon added: ""The UN as the international body responsible for implementing international law can ensure that is exactly what happens."" Princess Latifa's father, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, is one of the richest heads of state in the world, the ruler of Dubai and vice-president of the UAE. The UAE has close relations with a number of Western countries, including the US and UK, which consider it a strategic ally. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum is the 71-year-old billionaire ruler of Dubai Sheikh Mohammed has built a hugely successful city but rights activists say there is no tolerance of dissent and the judicial system can discriminate against women. With the help of friends, Princess Latifa tried to flee Dubai to start a new life in February 2018. ""I'm not allowed to drive, I'm not allowed to travel or leave Dubai at all,"" she said in a video recorded just before her escape. What are women's rights in Dubai? The princess who vanished Timeline: Failed escapes of sheikh's daughters Sheikh Mohammed Al Maktoum: Who is Dubai's ruler? But days later, the princess was captured by commandos on a boat in the Indian Ocean. She was flown back to Dubai, where she has remained ever since. Her father said he was acting in her best interests. Dubai and the UAE have previously said Princess Latifa was safe in the care of family. Ashitha Nagesh, BBC News Women in the UAE are allowed to drive, vote, work, and own and inherit property, making the country the second-best in the Middle East and North Africa (Mena) for gender equality,according to the World Economic Forum,external(WEF). But, to put this in context, the Mena region had the lowest score of all the regions. The UAE was ranked 120th in the world out of 153. There are still aspects of a woman's personal life in the country that are controlled by a male ""guardian"" - often a spouse or other male relative. Although the UAE isn't as strict as neighbouring Saudi Arabia, women still need their guardian's permission in order to get married. Divorce is also much harder for women; men don't need permission but women have to apply for a court order. And while the UAE does have an anti-discrimination law, sex and gender aren't included in its protected categories. Some laws have changed in the last few years, at least on the surface. An explicit permission for domestic violence was removed from the penal code in 2016. The requirement in the personal status law for women to ""obey"" their husbands was revoked in 2019, and the law was amended to make its language more gender-neutral. And last March a new law allowing women access to protection orders - such as restraining orders - came into effect. However, the new law defines domestic violence as abuse or threats that ""exceed [an individual's] guardianship, jurisdiction, authority or responsibility"", meaning it's ultimately down to judges to decide whether men have gone beyond their ""authority"" or not. In practice, protections for abuse victims are still weak. Sheikh Mohammed has a vast horse-racing enterprise and frequently attends major events such as Royal Ascot, where he has been pictured with Queen Elizabeth II. But he has faced severe criticism over the treatment of Princess Latifa and her stepmother, Princess Haya Bint Al Hussain, who fled to London in 2019 with her two children. ""There are no charges. It's pure punishment,"" Matthew Hedges,the British academic jailed for spying in the UAE in 2018, told the BBC when asked about the Princess Latifa case. ""There's no one looking out for her. It brings [my experiences] back quite dramatically,"" he added. Princess Latifa's videos were obtained by BBC Panorama, which has independently verified the details of where she was held. Watch the Missing Princess on BBC iPlayer The videos were recorded over several months on a phone she was secretly given about a year after her capture and return to Dubai. She recorded them in a bathroom as it had the only door she could lock. In the messages, she detailed how: she fought back against the soldiers taking her off the boat, ""kicking and fighting"" and biting one Emirati commando's arm until he screamed after being tranquillised she lost consciousness as she was being carried on to a private jet, and didn't wake up until it landed in Dubai she was being held alone without access to medical or legal help in a villa with windows and doors barred shut, and guarded by police Princess Latifa's account of her capture and detention was revealed by her close friend Tiina Jauhiainen, maternal cousin Marcus Essabri and campaigner David Haigh, who are all behind the Free Latifa campaign.

Google to pay Murdoch's News Corp for stories,"Google has agreed to pay Rupert Murdoch's News Corp for content from news sites across its media empire. News Corporation said it would be sharing its stories in exchange for ""significant payments"". Mr Murdoch has long called for Google and other internet platforms to pay media companies for their output. Amid mounting pressure from lawmakers in Australia and elsewhere,Google last year said it would start to pay some publishers for stories. ""This has been a passionate cause for our company for well over a decade and I am gratified that the terms of trade are changing, not just for News Corp, but for every publisher,"" said Robert Thomson, News Corporation chief executive. The company owns The Sun, The Times, the Wall Street Journal, and the Australian, among other publications. ""For many years, we were accused of tilting at tech windmills, but what was a solitary campaign, a quixotic quest, has become a movement, and both journalism and society will be enhanced,"" Mr Thomson said. Google last year said it would start licensing ""high-quality content"",externalfrom publishers around the world aspart of a $1bn initiative,external. It has signed up hundreds of media outlets in Germany, Brazil and the UK, among others, to participate in its Google News Showcase programme. The deal with News Corp comes just days before Australia is due to pass a law allowing it to appoint an arbitrator to set fees if Google or other platforms cannot not come to terms with publishers on their own. Google has threatened to cut its search engine in Australia over the plans. On Wednesday,Facebook said,externalit would restrict news on its platform in the country. In his statement, Mr Thomson said ""particular thanks"" was due to Australian politicians who backed the proposal.

It also gives news organisations more control over which stories are promoted and how they appear to users who follow their outlets. As part of its three-year-agreement, News Corp said the two firms would also collaborate on a subscription platform, share advertising revenue and invest in video journalism on YouTube, which shares a parent company with Google. News Corp has previously struck payment deals with Apple and Facebook. Financial deals of the News Corp deal were not disclosed.

Senedd member due in court over murder trial tweet,"Ms Jones retweeted the post on Saturday A Plaid Cymru politician has been ordered to appear in court after she retweeted ""highly inappropriate"" comments about a murder trial. Helen Mary Jones MS shared a tweet from a domestic abuse campaigner expressing ""hope"" that a man would be found guilty of murdering his wife. The tweet was posted on Saturday and shared by Ms Jones the same day. It related to thetrial of Anthony Williams, 70, who killed his wife during lockdown in March. The tweet was written by Rachel Williams, who wasshot at her Newport hair salon by her estranged husband Darren Williamsin 2011. He was found hanged in a woodland hours after the attack, and six weeks later her 16-year-old son took his own life in the same area. Ms Williams went on to become a prominent anti-domestic violence campaigner and pioneer of the Ask for Ani [Action Needed Immediately] scheme, of which the Duchess of Cornwall is a patron. Her tweet included the comment: ""As so many of us will know, there would have been history of domestic abuse. I hope this jury finds him guilty of murder."" Rachel Williams has become a prominent campaigner against domestic abuse The issue can only now be reported after reporting restrictions were lifted on Wednesday. Both Ms Jones and Ms Williams have been ordered by Judge Paul Thomas to appear at Swansea Crown Court on Thursday. Ms Williams deleted the tweet on Monday, after being contacted by Gwent Police officers on the instruction of the judge. No evidence was heard during the trial that the defendant had a history of domestic abuse. Husband not guilty of murdering wife in lockdown Man 'choked his wife' days into Covid lockdown Plaid AM sorry for suicide reference In England and Wales, jurors are meant to deliver verdicts solely based on evidence heard in court, and told to ignore any information or commentary from external sources, including on social media. The Contempt of Court Act makes it an offence to publish anything which could prejudice or impede a trial. Anthony Williams was found not guilty of murdering his wife - but admitted manslaughter by diminished responsibility There was no evidence of a history of domestic abuse heard during the trial of Anthony Williams, who strangled his wife Ruth during lockdown The tweet was posted after the jury in the murder trial had adjourned their deliberations for the weekend. On their return to court on Monday, Judge Thomas drew their attention to the social media commentary, saying: ""It's come to my attention that, over the weekend, there have been some highly inappropriate comments made on social media about this case. ""I should make it abundantly clear that those comments have not come from anybody connected with the case and, having been shown the contents of one such piece of social media, they clearly don't have any idea about the evidence in this case or the issues in this case."" The judge said domestic violence ""is a terrible scourge"", but added that a ""one-size-fits-all approach is highly inappropriate, particularly in this case"". Addressing both prosecution and defence, Judge Thomas said: ""This case will be before me on Thursday. Those involved will have to make themselves available on Thursday, and they should be told that forthwith."" No jury members said they had seen the Twitter posts, and resumed their deliberations before finding Williams not guilty of murder on Monday afternoon. He will be sentenced for manslaughter by reason of diminished responsibility on Thursday after previously admitting the charge. A spokesman for Plaid Cymru said ""it is not appropriate for the party to comment"" about Ms Jones' summons to court.

"Ministers not fully ready for Covid, says watchdog","The Scottish government was not adequately prepared for the Covid-19 pandemic, according to a new report by the public spending watchdog. AnAudit Scotland report,externalsaid ministers had been planning for a pandemic - but had based their preparations on flu. The watchdog also found the government acted quickly to prevent the NHS from being overwhelmed by coronavirus. Opposition leaders said the failure to heed warnings and prepare better had cost the lives of care home residents. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon there were ""lots of lessons to learn"" from the report, but insisted that ""the steps we have taken are the right ones"". 'Shocking' to see more people in 30s in ICU Planned NHS operations drop 35% in December How do hospital numbers compare with April's peak? The watchdog found that despite a number of pandemic planning exercises - in 2015, 2016 and 2018 - not all the actions identified in these projects were fully implemented. These included measures to ensure access to enough personal protective equipment (PPE) and to quickly address social care capacity. The report said the government had been ""slow"" to implement suggested changes in areas that would later become a ""significant challenge"" during the pandemic. It stated that ministers ""could have been better prepared to respond to the Covid-19 pandemic"" and said lessons must be learned. However, auditors also found that actions such as cancelling non-urgent operations and increasing intensive care capacity had stopped the NHS from being overwhelmed in the first wave of Covid. Nicola Sturgeon said planning exercised had been focused on a flu pandemic, rather than a SARS-type outbreak There were heated exchanges about the report during Ms Sturgeon's weekly question session at Holyrood, where she defended her government's response. Scottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson said Audit Scotland had set out ""in black and white"" that the government was ""less prepared that it should have been"". She said: ""Mistakes were made by this government, mistakes that cost the health of frontline workers, mistakes that cost the lives of care home residents, mistakes that built up over a decade of delay. ""The report makes it plain that her government was warned again and again, there were years where this first minister could have acted."" Ms Sturgeon said ""a range of national and local pandemic guidance and plans"" had been updated in light of the planning exercise - but stressed that they had focused on a flu pandemic rather than the ""different beast"" of Covid-19. She said: ""However well prepared we were for flu, it became clear quite quickly that we were dealing with something of a completely different nature. ""If I reflect back on the last 10 months I actually think the more valid criticism of the Scottish government and other governments across the Western world is that in the early stages we maybe relied a bit too much on flu preparations, and perhaps hadn't done enough to prepare for the experiences of SARS-type outbreaks."" The first minister also said had ""sought to do nothing over the past 10 months other than every single day to do my best and make sure the government was doing its best to steer this country through the pandemic as safely as we could"". The NHS Louisa Jordan was built in two weeks in April to respond to concerns over hospital capacity Scottish Labour group leader Jackie Baillie said the report ""makes clear a pandemic should have been anticipated"", and said ""lives could have been saved"" had warnings been heeded. She said: ""The government knew it could threaten the lives of people across Scotland, they were told the social care system would struggle to cope, and they were warned that access to protective equipment for doctors and nurses simply wasn't good enough. Now we know they didn't act on any of those warnings."" Ms Sturgeon replied that Scotland had ""never once run out of PPE"", and that her government had ""shown leadership"" throughout the pandemic. She said she would look to learn lessons ""every day"", adding: ""Let's engage properly on these things, not just chuck soundbites across a parliamentary chamber."" It is estimated the pandemic will cost the NHS Â£1.67bn in 2020-21 alone. The knock-on effects mean there is a ""substantial backlog of patients"" waiting to be seen in the NHS, according to Audit Scotland. Stephen Boyle, auditor general for Scotland, praised the ""extraordinary commitment"" of NHS staff but said the pandemic had ""highlighted the need to deal with long-standing health inequalities"". Hetold Good Morning Scotlandthat the financial sustainability of the NHS had been under threat for years. Mr Boyle said auditors had emphasised in a number of reports the importance of longer term planning, and shifting the balance of care away from large hospitals to community-based care. The government was expecting a pandemic. It had rehearsed scenarios, carried out table-top exercises and simulations, all of which identified the need to better prepare care homes and to improve stockpiles of PPE. And despite assessing a flu pandemic as a high risk, the government did not identify it as a stand-alone factor when considering the biggest challenges to the health service. Scotland is not alone in being caught off guard, and the report points to some of the things that went well. Speedily increasing the capacity of intensive care and hospital beds for example, and rapidly rolling out the use of digital technology. But this is the first time we've seen in black and white from an independent body that there were shortcomings in the preparations. A public inquiry will later look at the decisions that were made. Dr Lewis Morrison, chairman of the BMA Scotland, said there was ""some concern"" that the government could have been better prepared, especially when it came to PPE for doctors. He said pre-existing challenges for the NHS had been ""exacerbated by Covid"", and that restarting services was going to be a ""substantial challenge"". Covid has caused or contributed to the deaths of about 9,000 people in Scotland so far, with those from the most deprived areas or ethnic minorities among the worst affected. The forecasted Â£1.67bn cost of Covid in 2020-21 includes Â£324.5m on PPE and a near 10% rise in staffing costs. Responding to the report, the Royal College of Nursing said lessons needed to be learned and the ""immense pressure"" staff had faced for sustained period should be recognised. It said nurses were concerned about potential long-termâ¯risks to their physical and mental health,â¯including PTSD and long Covid.â¯ RULES:What are the restrictions in Scotland?

"Make children priority after Covid, watchdog says","Vulnerable children must be at the heart of government plans to ""build back better"" after the pandemic, England's children's commissioner says. Anne Longfield called on Boris Johnson to put them at the ""centre stage"" of plans to ""level up"" the nation. In a final speech after six years in the role, she said it was a ""terrible thing"" that ""most of their lives would have got worse"" during the pandemic. Ministers said protecting vulnerable children was central to its response. A spokesperson added: ""That's why we have enabled the most vulnerable children to continue attending school in person, while providing laptops, devices and data packages to those learning at home and ensuring the most disadvantaged children are fed and warm."" It comes after warnings that children may be ""losing all hope for their future"" and as surveys suggest young people's mental health is worsening, partly due to the fallout from Covid-19. The devastating toll of the pandemic on children Lockdown 'sees vulnerable children slip from view' Children 'failed' by broken care system Ms Longfield said the prime minister's commitment to putting schools at the heart of reopening of society when lockdown eases was ""really welcome"". ""There have been points during the year where I was dismayed when schools stayed shut and shops and pubs opened but the prime minister's come behind what we were pushing for which was for the schools to be the last last to close and the first to open,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. She estimated around Â£10bn will be needed for children's mental health support and help for pupils in school to catch-up. Ms Longfield said she believed Boris Johnson wants to ""build back better"" for children but did not think he has the ""structures in government around him"" to be able to do that. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SOCIAL DISTANCING:How can I meet my friend safely? OXFORD JAB:What is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? Tory MP Robert Halfon, the chairman of the Education Select Committee, said the pandemic had ""laid bare the damning truth about our educational divide"". In a response to Ms Longfield's speech,Mr Halfon said on Twitter,externalthat children were facing a ""torrid barrage of lost learning and a new frontier of vulnerabilities"". He urged ministers to focus on the ""complex challenges that exist in some children's lives"", adding that the school closures could reverse the progress made since 2011. Ms Longfield said her departing address aimed to set out a ""challenge to government and all political parties"". An entire generation risks being defined by the coronavirus crisis and some children may start school so far behind their peers ""they'll never catch up"", she said. But she said while the pandemic meant the country was facing the ""biggest challenge to our society in 70 years, it is also an opportunity to reflect and rebuild"". Ms Longfield suggested the Â£1.5bn so far committed to a pupil catch-up fundÂ for England was a demonstration of the Treasury's ""institutional bias against children"" - when compared with aresearch group's estimate that children are facing up to Â£350bn in lost earningsas a result of school closures.Â She highlighted US President Joe Biden's new package of tax credits and benefits for families with children as an example of the type of action the government could take. Mr Johnson's promise to ""level up"" the country will be ""just a slogan"" unless children are at the heart of the effort, she added. Ms Longfield said ministers had focused too much on school improvements ""without recognising that many of the outcomes for the children attending the schools are overall getting worse"". Calling for a new ""Covid Covenant"" of education and well-being support in every community, she said school holidays should be used to catch children up with lost lessons. The children's commissioner said is a ""national scandal"" the fact almost a fifth of children in England leave school or college without basic qualifications. And highlighting the case of a 16-year-old who died after being coerced into drug trafficking, she said children exploited by gangsare being failed by adults who ""simply don't see them"". A government spokesman said its long-term catch-up plans would combine with an investment of more than Â£1bn to ""ensure we make up for lost time in education over the course of this Parliament"". He added: ""Anne Longfield has been a tireless advocate for children, and we're grateful for her dedication and her challenge on areas where we can continue raising the bar for the most vulnerable."" Dame Rachel de Souza, a former chief executive of a multi-academy trust, will take over as the new children's commissioner for England in March.

Iceland director sacked after Welsh language jibes,"The supermarket chain has its headquarters in north Wales A supermarket chain's PR chief has been sacked after comments about Wales, its language and the UK Celtic nations. Keith Hann was dismissed by frozen food specialists Iceland ""with immediate effect"" after remarks on Twitter. Further comments on a personal blog also emerged, describing the Welsh language as ""incomprehensible"" and ""gibberish"". Iceland is based in north Wales, and said the comments did not reflect their values. An official at Iceland apologised for any upset or offence caused by the comments. The BBC has attempted to contact Mr Hann to respond. Should your boss be tweeting? Social media pitfalls for business His latest controversial post on Twitter commented onthe TV star Amanda Holden being accused of breaching lockdown rules by travelling to Cornwall. ""Your periodic reminder that the inhabitants of the UK's Celtic fringe loath ALL visitors, in and out of lockdown,"" he said. His social media account was later made private, with his profile stating: ""All views my own and usually joking"". Keith Hann's original tweet responding to the Amanda Holden story has been deleted, along with his account on the social media platform The account has since been deleted. Further posts in a personal blog called Bloke in the North then emerged. In one, dating back to 2009, he reflected: ""I suppose as a last resort we could always move a couple of miles west so that I could legitimately call myself Bloke in the North (of Wales), with the (of Wales) being silent. ""The price for this, if we sent the baby to a state school, would be having part of his education conducted in gibberish. But I dare say that Welsh would prove no more incomprehensible and useless to him than trigonometry and algebra did to me in my day."" In another, he referred to Welsh signage in supermarkets as ""incomprehensible"" and described it as ""a dead language that sounds uncannily like someone with bad catarrh clearing his throat"". Announcing Mr Hann's departure, Iceland said in a statement: ""Iceland has taken action in light of recent comments made by its director of corporate affairs, resulting in the dismissal of Mr Hann with immediate effect. The firm, whose headquarters are on Deeside in Flintshire, added: ""We would like to reiterate that these comments in no way reflect the values or philosophy of our business. ""We are a proud Welsh company, with a long history of investment in communities across Wales, and apologise for any upset or offence caused."" Welsh language commissioner Aled Roberts said Mr Hann's comments showed a lack of respect, adding ""these attitudes belonged to the past, but unfortunately there are individuals who still harbour these views"".

LiveLiveEngland restrictions to be lifted in stages - PM2 minutes ago,"The easing of England's lockdown will be based on a ""cautious and prudent approach"", Prime Minister Boris Johnson says England is still âsome way awayâ from being able to start relaxing lockdown restrictions, the chief executive of NHS Providers says A further 738 deaths have been reported in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test There have also been another 12,718 daily UK cases, while 15,940,972 people have received the first dose of a vaccine The UK will expose a group of healthy volunteers aged 18-30 to Covid-19 in a bid to establish which vaccines and treatments work best Fatigue, headache, sore throat and diarrhoea should be added to the symptoms which trigger a Covid test, researchers suggest The EU has bought up to 300 million Moderna vaccine doses, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen confirms Edited by Katie Wright Thank you for joining us for live updates on the coronavirus pandemic. They were brought to you by Alice Evans, Becky Morton, James Clarke, Jennifer Meierhans, Katie Wright and Sophie Williams. Boris Johnson visited a vaccination centre in Cwmbran, south Wales We are going to be bringing the live page to a close soon, so here's a recap of the day's coronavirus news: A family have harnessed the power of the imagination to ""go on holiday"" at home during England's lockdown. The Hodgsons packed their bags and embarked on a two-day trip to tropical ""Hodgeland"", complete with an airport departure lounge and a plane journey. The Disney-mad family from Leeds say it lifted their spirits during the ""toughest"" lockdown yet. The plan was conjured up by Heather Hodgson, who kept husband Dom and four-year-old Scarlett in the dark about the itinerary. Mr Hodgson says: ""The little details really made it, she built a website to check in our passports for our flight, pre-recorded airport announcements and put tropical air fresheners around the room."" Have a look at the holiday snapshere. Police in Greater Manchester have dealt with 1,200 Covid-related incidents in a week after a ""resurgence"" in parties and large gatherings, officials say. They have also seen greater ""resistance"" to police enforcement, officials for the Greater Manchester Combined Authority say. Speaking at a weekly press conference Bev Hughes, deputy mayor for policing and crime, said 280 fixed penalty notices had been issued in the past week, including 55 fines of Â£800, of which 32 were handed out at a mass gathering in Salford. Police also released footage of a large party at Beetham Tower on Deansgate which ended up in ""a fight with about 50 people, and the owner is being pursued there for the Â£10,000 fine,"" she says. Several gyms, backroom bars and pubs, and a large yoga gathering were also found to be operating in the region. Olivia Hall gave birth at the start of the pandemic. She was one of the first cases to be placed in isolation at Southmead Hospital in Bristol. Her son, Harrison Ahyow, is now a toddler and she says it ""saddens"" her that no-one was able to see him as a baby. She says she has flashbacks to his birth on 25 March during the first lockdown. ""I'd been left for hours labouring in the hospital car park,"" she says. ""They didn't know where to put me, having shown symptoms for coronavirus 10 days previously. ""They weren't testing then so I went into hospital alone, and 24 hours later I went into surgery alone. ""An emergency C-section was required to deliver my first child. We're 10-and-a-half months later and I've seen a health visitor once."" Read Olivia's take on motherhood and lockdown life in her own words. Scottish crime author Ian Rankinsays his son Kit has been ""forgotten""as vaccines were delivered to care homes. The 26-year-old - who has severe learning difficulties - lives in care in Edinburgh, but did not qualify in the first priority group. The Scottish government said it had ""rightly"" prioritised those at higher mortality risk. People with a ""severe or profound"" learning disabilityare in priority group six for the coronavirus vaccine,external. Rankin told the BBC: ""Our son can't look after himself and he's in the same group as us - his parents, who are healthy 65-year-olds. People with learning difficulties should have been prioritised. ""It's a bit late now. My son will get the jab in the next month or so. But we should learn lessons for the future about what it seems to be a bit of a lottery."" More than Â£500,000 has been raised to help a mountain rescue volunteer who suffered life-changing injuries going to the aid of campers who had broken coronavirus lockdown restrictions. Chris Lewis, a member of the Patterdale Mountain Rescue Team in the Lake District, suffered severe spinal injuries when he fell 500ft (150m). Lewis, 60, also suffered multiple facial fractures in the fall at Red Screes, above Kirkstone Pass on 6 February. Colleagues described the fundraising support,which saw more than 20,000 people donate in less than 48 hours,as ""phenomenal"". The campers, from Liverpool and Leicester,have both been fined Â£200. An investigation was launched last March after numerous complaints about the lack of precautions for workers in New York Internet giant Amazon is being sued by New York over its
coronavirus response. In a lawsuit, Attorney General General
Letitia James said her inquiry into conditions at two warehouses in New York
City found Amazon implemented a âdeficientâ programme to trace the
contacts of infected workers. She also claims the company did
not follow rules requiring companies to shut and disinfect areas that had been
visited by a sick person, among other violations. James launched her investigation last March after numerous complaints about the lack of precautions for workers in New York, then the epicentre of the US coronavirus outbreak. Amazon last week attempted to
block the lawsuit with its own legal action. It said James was applying ""an inconsistent and
unfair"" standard. Read more here Northern Ireland's vaccine rollout is running weeks ahead of schedule, Health Minister Robin Swann has said. Carers and more people with underlying health conditions were due to be vaccinated in March butthis will be brought forward ""on a staggered basis"",he says. ""As ever, the rate of our progress through the eligible groups will depend on available supplies of vaccines,"" he says. The vaccine rollout will be divided between GP practices and the seven regional vaccination centres. On Wednesday, the Department of Health recorded six more Covid-19 related deaths, taking its death toll to 2,015. Cathy KillickJournalist, BBC Look North I lost both of my parents to Covid within six weeks. I've been a reporter for the BBC for more than 30 years. In that time I've interviewed dozens of people who have experienced loss. I've done my best to convey their emotion faithfully, not having experienced it myself. Now I find I am one of those people. I've always been struck by the bravery of those I've talked to and I've always been grateful to them too. Journalism can only exist if people are willing to share their stories, so I'm going to share mine not because I'm brave, but because I owe them. I've made this video below and the full story ishere. This video can not be played All Premier League football matches willremain available to watch live in the UK until fans are allowed to return to stadiums. Matches will continue to be broadcast by Sky Sports, BT Sport, Amazon Prime Video and the BBC. Premier League football has been played behind closed doors since the 2019-20 season resumed in June following the first coronavirus lockdown. Some Premier League clubs were able to welcome up to 2,000 fans in December, but games were soon moved back behind closed doors amid rising cases of Covid-19. Earlier this month, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told BBC Sport there was a""long path ahead of us""before fans could return to stadiums. On Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to announce how the current lockdown in England will be eased. President Cyril Ramaphosa was amongst those vaccinated on the first day As we mentioned earlier, South
Africa has started Covid vaccinations following the suspension of an earlier
plan to use the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. A new variant accounts for most
of the new cases in South Africa. South Africa put the rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on hold, following a study thatshowed ""disappointing"" results against the country's new Covid-19 strain. South
Africa says it has so far secured enough doses for the target population of 40
million. However,
there has been criticism the government was too slow to act. Read more about immunisations and what the government is saying. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Volunteers will get coronavirus squirted up their noses As we've been reporting today, a group of UK volunteers aresoon to be deliberately infected with coronavirusin what's known as a ""challenge trial"". It will be the first such trial in Covid anywhere in the world. The volunteers will come into hospital and spend the whole time in a single room, and come into contact only with people running the trial. On the third day, a small syringe filled with live virus will be squirted up their nose. They will be monitored in hospital - including regular blood samples - for at least the following two weeks, after which they can go home if they are free of the virus. The volunteers will continue to be followed up for a year. Challenge trials and traditional trials are both important but there are some advantages to challenge trials, such as that they get results - including on vaccine effectiveness - incredibly quickly. This is because everyone is deliberately infected, whereas a ""real-world"" trial would have to wait for people to catch the virus in their day-to-day lives. The UK trial is focusing on young people (aged 18-30) with no health problems, who we know are very unlikely to have any health problems from a coronavirus infection, and they will be closely monitored in hospital. The risk is low, but a challenge trial is not completely risk-free. Read the full explainer here. Following the UK government's release of daily coronavirus statistics, here are some charts showing the country's epidemic. To track case numbers in your area and see more graphs and charts,read our full story. Labour's shadow health secretary says he expects the government to lift Covid restrictions in England through ""gradual easing"" rather than ending lockdown ""in one big snap"". Speaking to reporters, Jonathan Ashworth agrees withPrime Minister Boris Johnson's comments made earlier today- that any easing should be driven by data rather than dates. ""But we have to be cautious because this has got to be the final lockdown,"" Ashworth adds. He agrees the vaccination programme has been ""a success"" but says the government needs to ""do more"" to stop the spread of the virus when lockdown measures are eased. Ashworth lists sick pay as one of the elements that needs addressing and says ""double-masking"" -a concept being recommended in the US- should also be considered when UK ministers review the rules. The PM will set out details on Monday on the plan for lifting restrictions. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Tens of millions of people will still be travelling daily between now and the beginning of March In the past 24 hours, China has reported no new
domestically-transmitted cases of Covid-19. This has pretty much been the story for the last week, and Chinese
media have been praising these statistics, and thanking groups of people that
the government urged shouldnât travel during the Spring Festival holiday
period. In particular, they have praised university students, migrants and
overseas Chinese. In January, there were multiple outbreaks of the virus in the
northeast of the country. And as hundreds of thousands of people traditionally travel across
China for the Lunar New Year â which this year fell on 12 February - to spend
time with their families, there were government concerns this annual
migration might exacerbate the spread of the coronavirus. Consequently, Chinaâs central government tried to
discourage people from travelling this year, and local governmentsintroduced financial incentives for people to stay put. The government also introduced special measures
for those who did still intend to travel, in order to keep them safe. Travellers were instructed to show a negative Covid-19 test within seven
days of their journey, and encouraged toself-isolate for 14 days on arrival at their destination. Tens of millions of people will still be travelling daily between
now and the beginning of March, but today is the last public holiday in China,
so the majority of people made their return journeys today. Caroline DaviesBBC transport correspondent One of the hotel rooms being used to quarantine arrivals Quarantine hotels in the UK opened to their first guests on Monday, but some have expressed concerns about their safety, the cost and whether the system works. Everyone who has visited or transited through 33 countries on the UK's ""red list"" who arrive in England must stay 11 nights in a quarantine hotel - at a cost of Â£1,750 for a single person. Mohammed Mostafa travelled to London after visiting family in Bangladesh. While the country is not on the red list, Mr Mostafa transited through the UAE which is - and the new measures took him by surprise. ""It was absolutely shocking and I felt quite intimidated as well,"" Mostafa told AFP news. He is staying at the Holiday Inn hotel and described his room as ""like a prison"". Read more. Tracy Moore and her husband Jason lost hundreds of pounds when they were told to isolate Self-isolation is costing people who do not qualify for financial support hundreds of pounds in lost income. Most applications to Wales' Â£500 self-isolation grant scheme have been rejected. Under the existing system, applicants must stand to lose income by isolating, and be on at least one of a range of benefits. The Welsh government announced on Wednesday it was expanding the scheme to include people not on any benefits but with a personal income of less than Â£500 net per week or on basic statutory sick pay. Tracy Moore, from Flintshire, saw her household income fall about Â£700 last month, and told BBC Wales Live the way the support system worked was ""wrong"". Her husband and son work for a Tarmac company and shared their van with someone who tested positive the following day. They called 111 and were advised to isolate for 10 days - but when they tried to apply for financial help they were told they were not eligible as they had not formally been asked to isolate by Test, Trace, Protect.

They were brought to you by Alice Evans, Becky Morton, James Clarke, Jennifer Meierhans, Katie Wright and Sophie Williams. Boris Johnson visited a vaccination centre in Cwmbran, south Wales We are going to be bringing the live page to a close soon, so here's a recap of the day's coronavirus news: A family have harnessed the power of the imagination to ""go on holiday"" at home during England's lockdown. The Hodgsons packed their bags and embarked on a two-day trip to tropical ""Hodgeland"", complete with an airport departure lounge and a plane journey. The Disney-mad family from Leeds say it lifted their spirits during the ""toughest"" lockdown yet. The plan was conjured up by Heather Hodgson, who kept husband Dom and four-year-old Scarlett in the dark about the itinerary. Mr Hodgson says: ""The little details really made it, she built a website to check in our passports for our flight, pre-recorded airport announcements and put tropical air fresheners around the room."" Have a look at the holiday snapshere. Police in Greater Manchester have dealt with 1,200 Covid-related incidents in a week after a ""resurgence"" in parties and large gatherings, officials say. They have also seen greater ""resistance"" to police enforcement, officials for the Greater Manchester Combined Authority say. Speaking at a weekly press conference Bev Hughes, deputy mayor for policing and crime, said 280 fixed penalty notices had been issued in the past week, including 55 fines of Â£800, of which 32 were handed out at a mass gathering in Salford. Police also released footage of a large party at Beetham Tower on Deansgate which ended up in ""a fight with about 50 people, and the owner is being pursued there for the Â£10,000 fine,"" she says. Several gyms, backroom bars and pubs, and a large yoga gathering were also found to be operating in the region. Olivia Hall gave birth at the start of the pandemic. She was one of the first cases to be placed in isolation at Southmead Hospital in Bristol. Her son, Harrison Ahyow, is now a toddler and she says it ""saddens"" her that no-one was able to see him as a baby. She says she has flashbacks to his birth on 25 March during the first lockdown. ""I'd been left for hours labouring in the hospital car park,"" she says. ""They didn't know where to put me, having shown symptoms for coronavirus 10 days previously. ""They weren't testing then so I went into hospital alone, and 24 hours later I went into surgery alone. ""An emergency C-section was required to deliver my first child. We're 10-and-a-half months later and I've seen a health visitor once."" Read Olivia's take on motherhood and lockdown life in her own words. Scottish crime author Ian Rankinsays his son Kit has been ""forgotten""as vaccines were delivered to care homes. The 26-year-old - who has severe learning difficulties - lives in care in Edinburgh, but did not qualify in the first priority group. The Scottish government said it had ""rightly"" prioritised those at higher mortality risk. People with a ""severe or profound"" learning disabilityare in priority group six for the coronavirus vaccine,external. Rankin told the BBC: ""Our son can't look after himself and he's in the same group as us - his parents, who are healthy 65-year-olds. People with learning difficulties should have been prioritised. ""It's a bit late now. My son will get the jab in the next month or so. But we should learn lessons for the future about what it seems to be a bit of a lottery."" More than Â£500,000 has been raised to help a mountain rescue volunteer who suffered life-changing injuries going to the aid of campers who had broken coronavirus lockdown restrictions. Chris Lewis, a member of the Patterdale Mountain Rescue Team in the Lake District, suffered severe spinal injuries when he fell 500ft (150m). Lewis, 60, also suffered multiple facial fractures in the fall at Red Screes, above Kirkstone Pass on 6 February. Colleagues described the fundraising support,which saw more than 20,000 people donate in less than 48 hours,as ""phenomenal"". The campers, from Liverpool and Leicester,have both been fined Â£200. An investigation was launched last March after numerous complaints about the lack of precautions for workers in New York Internet giant Amazon is being sued by New York over its
coronavirus response. In a lawsuit, Attorney General General
Letitia James said her inquiry into conditions at two warehouses in New York
City found Amazon implemented a âdeficientâ programme to trace the
contacts of infected workers. She also claims the company did
not follow rules requiring companies to shut and disinfect areas that had been
visited by a sick person, among other violations. James launched her investigation last March after numerous complaints about the lack of precautions for workers in New York, then the epicentre of the US coronavirus outbreak. Amazon last week attempted to
block the lawsuit with its own legal action. It said James was applying ""an inconsistent and
unfair"" standard. Read more here Northern Ireland's vaccine rollout is running weeks ahead of schedule, Health Minister Robin Swann has said. Carers and more people with underlying health conditions were due to be vaccinated in March butthis will be brought forward ""on a staggered basis"",he says. ""As ever, the rate of our progress through the eligible groups will depend on available supplies of vaccines,"" he says. The vaccine rollout will be divided between GP practices and the seven regional vaccination centres. On Wednesday, the Department of Health recorded six more Covid-19 related deaths, taking its death toll to 2,015. Cathy KillickJournalist, BBC Look North I lost both of my parents to Covid within six weeks. I've been a reporter for the BBC for more than 30 years. In that time I've interviewed dozens of people who have experienced loss. I've done my best to convey their emotion faithfully, not having experienced it myself. Now I find I am one of those people. I've always been struck by the bravery of those I've talked to and I've always been grateful to them too. Journalism can only exist if people are willing to share their stories, so I'm going to share mine not because I'm brave, but because I owe them. I've made this video below and the full story ishere. This video can not be played All Premier League football matches willremain available to watch live in the UK until fans are allowed to return to stadiums. Matches will continue to be broadcast by Sky Sports, BT Sport, Amazon Prime Video and the BBC. Premier League football has been played behind closed doors since the 2019-20 season resumed in June following the first coronavirus lockdown. Some Premier League clubs were able to welcome up to 2,000 fans in December, but games were soon moved back behind closed doors amid rising cases of Covid-19. Earlier this month, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told BBC Sport there was a""long path ahead of us""before fans could return to stadiums. On Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to announce how the current lockdown in England will be eased. President Cyril Ramaphosa was amongst those vaccinated on the first day As we mentioned earlier, South
Africa has started Covid vaccinations following the suspension of an earlier
plan to use the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. A new variant accounts for most
of the new cases in South Africa. South Africa put the rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on hold, following a study thatshowed ""disappointing"" results against the country's new Covid-19 strain. South
Africa says it has so far secured enough doses for the target population of 40
million. However,
there has been criticism the government was too slow to act. Read more about immunisations and what the government is saying. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Volunteers will get coronavirus squirted up their noses As we've been reporting today, a group of UK volunteers aresoon to be deliberately infected with coronavirusin what's known as a ""challenge trial"". It will be the first such trial in Covid anywhere in the world. The volunteers will come into hospital and spend the whole time in a single room, and come into contact only with people running the trial. On the third day, a small syringe filled with live virus will be squirted up their nose. They will be monitored in hospital - including regular blood samples - for at least the following two weeks, after which they can go home if they are free of the virus. The volunteers will continue to be followed up for a year. Challenge trials and traditional trials are both important but there are some advantages to challenge trials, such as that they get results - including on vaccine effectiveness - incredibly quickly. This is because everyone is deliberately infected, whereas a ""real-world"" trial would have to wait for people to catch the virus in their day-to-day lives. The UK trial is focusing on young people (aged 18-30) with no health problems, who we know are very unlikely to have any health problems from a coronavirus infection, and they will be closely monitored in hospital. The risk is low, but a challenge trial is not completely risk-free. Read the full explainer here. Following the UK government's release of daily coronavirus statistics, here are some charts showing the country's epidemic. To track case numbers in your area and see more graphs and charts,read our full story. Labour's shadow health secretary says he expects the government to lift Covid restrictions in England through ""gradual easing"" rather than ending lockdown ""in one big snap"". Speaking to reporters, Jonathan Ashworth agrees withPrime Minister Boris Johnson's comments made earlier today- that any easing should be driven by data rather than dates. ""But we have to be cautious because this has got to be the final lockdown,"" Ashworth adds. He agrees the vaccination programme has been ""a success"" but says the government needs to ""do more"" to stop the spread of the virus when lockdown measures are eased. Ashworth lists sick pay as one of the elements that needs addressing and says ""double-masking"" -a concept being recommended in the US- should also be considered when UK ministers review the rules. The PM will set out details on Monday on the plan for lifting restrictions. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Tens of millions of people will still be travelling daily between now and the beginning of March In the past 24 hours, China has reported no new
domestically-transmitted cases of Covid-19. This has pretty much been the story for the last week, and Chinese
media have been praising these statistics, and thanking groups of people that
the government urged shouldnât travel during the Spring Festival holiday
period. In particular, they have praised university students, migrants and
overseas Chinese. In January, there were multiple outbreaks of the virus in the
northeast of the country. And as hundreds of thousands of people traditionally travel across
China for the Lunar New Year â which this year fell on 12 February - to spend
time with their families, there were government concerns this annual
migration might exacerbate the spread of the coronavirus. Consequently, Chinaâs central government tried to
discourage people from travelling this year, and local governmentsintroduced financial incentives for people to stay put. The government also introduced special measures
for those who did still intend to travel, in order to keep them safe. Travellers were instructed to show a negative Covid-19 test within seven
days of their journey, and encouraged toself-isolate for 14 days on arrival at their destination. Tens of millions of people will still be travelling daily between
now and the beginning of March, but today is the last public holiday in China,
so the majority of people made their return journeys today. Caroline DaviesBBC transport correspondent One of the hotel rooms being used to quarantine arrivals Quarantine hotels in the UK opened to their first guests on Monday, but some have expressed concerns about their safety, the cost and whether the system works. Everyone who has visited or transited through 33 countries on the UK's ""red list"" who arrive in England must stay 11 nights in a quarantine hotel - at a cost of Â£1,750 for a single person. Mohammed Mostafa travelled to London after visiting family in Bangladesh. While the country is not on the red list, Mr Mostafa transited through the UAE which is - and the new measures took him by surprise. ""It was absolutely shocking and I felt quite intimidated as well,"" Mostafa told AFP news. He is staying at the Holiday Inn hotel and described his room as ""like a prison"". Read more. Tracy Moore and her husband Jason lost hundreds of pounds when they were told to isolate Self-isolation is costing people who do not qualify for financial support hundreds of pounds in lost income. Most applications to Wales' Â£500 self-isolation grant scheme have been rejected. Under the existing system, applicants must stand to lose income by isolating, and be on at least one of a range of benefits. The Welsh government announced on Wednesday it was expanding the scheme to include people not on any benefits but with a personal income of less than Â£500 net per week or on basic statutory sick pay. Tracy Moore, from Flintshire, saw her household income fall about Â£700 last month, and told BBC Wales Live the way the support system worked was ""wrong"". Her husband and son work for a Tarmac company and shared their van with someone who tested positive the following day. They called 111 and were advised to isolate for 10 days - but when they tried to apply for financial help they were told they were not eligible as they had not formally been asked to isolate by Test, Trace, Protect.

"Grenfell cladding firm gave fire test 'half-truth'But a ""disastrous"" failed test was not deliberately concealed by Arconic, the firm's president says.UK","The company that made the Grenfell Tower cladding told a ""misleading half-truth"" to a British standards board, its boss has accepted. Arconic only shared one successful fire test result with the British Board of AgrÃ©ment (BBA), and not a failed result, an inquiry into the fire heard. But Claude Schmidt, Arconic's president, denied the failed test was ""deliberately concealed"" by his firm. He said the BBA should have found the poor test result as part of an audit. The Grenfell Tower Inquiry is looking into how the west London tower block came to be covered in combustible materials, leading to the fire which killed 72 people in June 2017. Grenfell cladding boss says tests not 'priority' Fire brigade still to fix Grenfell failings Grenfell cladding company 'knew of fire risk' Arconic was awarded a product certificate for its Reynobond PE aluminium composite cladding in the UK by the BBA in 2008, opening up the possibility of more sales in the UK. However, Arconic's own fire tests of the product, years earlier, had produced very different outcomes. The first, on a version of the cladding designed to fit flat against the outside of a building, resulted in a class B rating, on a scale from A1 to F, where A1 is best. This result would have allowed it to have been used on high-rise buildings such as Grenfell Tower. The second test was carried out on a folded section of cladding, known in the industry as a ""cassette"". That test resulted in a class E rating as the cladding caught fire. When Arconic applied to the BBA for the certificate, the inquiry heard, it sent the results of the first test, but not the second, despite being asked to provide more evidence. The folded design was later chosen by designers for use on Grenfell Tower. The inquiry's lead counsel, Richard Millett QC, put it to Claude Schmidt that Arconic had a contractual requirement to provide all relevant information upfront. Mr Millett said the company had concealed the class E test, in which the cladding ""performed disastrously"" - which might have ""substantially affected sales of the product in the UK"". Speaking in French through an interpreter, Mr Schmidt said: ""I don't know why at the start that test wasn't mentioned... but it could have been found out, discovered in an audit."" Mr Millet asked if Mr Schmidt accepted that Arconic ""was telling the BBA a misleading half-truth"". ""Yes, you can see it like that,"" Mr Schmidt replied. Mr Schmidt accepted Mr Millett's suggestion that any user of Arconic's product would see the test result as ""absolutely crucial safety information"". But Arconic's president said it was ""too strong"" to describe the information as "" life-and-death stuff"". Documents presented to the inquiry show that negotiations with the BBA were led by a technical manager, Claude Wehrle. Mr Schmidt said: ""I can't know what Claude Wehrle was thinking about or reasoning at the time."" Mr Wehrle, a French national, hasrefused - despite repeated requests - to come to the inquiryto give evidence, because of legal advice he says he has received. The inquiry has the power to force British witnesses to give evidence, but not foreign nationals. Grenfell firm sold flammable cladding 'by default' Lies, sham tests & buck-passing - Grenfell's year of evidence Grenfell 'whistleblower' refusing to give evidence The issue of which standards the Arconic cladding met, and what testing was done on it, is at the centre of this phase of the public inquiry - and is an important component of the Metropolitan Police investigation. It is also one of the factors behind the building safety crisis affecting hundreds of thousands of people across the country. Immediately after the fire, residents of the Chalcots Estate in Camden, north London, had to leave their homes when the fire risk of Arconic Reynobond PE aluminium composite cladding was realised. Arconic's position has always been that it simply produced the raw materials for cladding systems, and it didn't necessarily know how they would be used, so could not know that they might not meet building regulations. Buton Tuesday, Mr Schmidt was askedby Mr Millett about ""occasions when Arconic did understand what project the product would be used for"". Asked whether Grenfell Tower was ""an example of that"", Mr Schmidt said: ""Yes."" The inquiry continues.

Actress sacked for anti-gay post loses legal fight,"Seyi Omooba was dismissed after her Facebook post from 2014 caused a social media backlash An actress sacked over a Facebook post attacking homosexuality has had her claim for discrimination, breach of contract and harassment rejected. Seyi Omooba, 26, sued Leicester's Curve Theatre and her former agents for Â£128,000 after being dropped from a stage performance of The Color Purple. She had been due to play the lead character Celie, sometimes depicted as being in a lesbian relationship. But she was dismissed when a Facebook post she wrote in 2014 emerged. The post was shared on social media by another actor unconnected to the play a few days after she was announced as being part of the cast in March 2019. The entry, written when the Christian actress was 20, said: ""I do not believe you can be born gay, and I do not believe homosexuality is right, though the law of this land has made it legal doesn't mean its right."" The virtual hearing of the Central London Employment Tribunal heard it sparked a social media backlash and she was sacked by Leicester Theatre Trust Ltd six days later following discussions in which Ms Omooba stood by her views. Three days later her contract with her agency Michael Garrett Associates Ltd (Global Artists) was also terminated. Director Steven Spielberg and Whoopi Goldberg, who played Celie, on the set of The Color Purple film The panel was toldshe had been ""unconditionally"" offered her full salary for the roleby the theatre but refused to invoice the trust, instead bringing legal action on the grounds she had suffered extensive career damage for espousing her religious beliefs. At the tribunal she sought Â£4,309 from the theatre plus a further Â£25,000 for injury to feelings and reputational damage. She also sued her former agency Â£98,752 for loss of earnings, future losses, injury to feelings and reputational damage. However, Ms Omooba's claims of discrimination, harassment and breach of contract were rejected by the tribunal panel. The panel dismissed her suggestion that her sacking by the theatre amounted to discrimination against her religious beliefs. In a written judgement, it concluded it was ""the effect of the adverse publicity from [the 2014 post's] retweet, without modification or explanation, on the cohesion of the cast, the audience's reception, the reputation of the producers and 'the good standing and commercial success' of the production, that were the reasons why she was dismissed"". On the harassment claim, it said: ""In the view of the tribunal Mr Stafford [Chris Stafford, chief executive of Leicester Theatre Trust] did not have the purpose of violating the claimant's dignity or creating an intimidating or humiliating environment for her. His purpose was to save the production."" Miss Omooba had claimed the character's sexuality was ambiguousand she would have refused the role if she had considered her gay. But this was rejected by the panel, with the panel commenting: ""She had taken part in a similar production, she had the script, and knowing that a lesbian relationship was at least one interpretation, she should have considered much earlier whether a red line was to be crossed."" Latest news and stories from the East Midlands The panel also rejected Ms Omooba's demands for compensation for loss of earnings, future losses and reputational damage as a result of her agency contract being terminated. ""There is no financial loss because she would not have played the part,"" it said. ""There is no loss of opportunity to enhance her reputation by performing, because she would not have played the part. ""If there is damage to her reputation, it was not caused by being dropped from the production but by an unconnected person's tweeting... of her Facebook post and the outcry resulting from that."" The production was due to open at the Curve Theatre in June 2019 Ms Omooba's case had been supported by the legal arm of Christian Concern, an organisation co-founded by her father, pastor Ade Omooba MBE. Andrea Williams, the group's chief executive, said: ""We're disappointed by the judgement and Seyi is considering her options for appeal."" Curve Theatre's management team said it was pleased with the outcome following a ""hugely challenging and upsetting time"". In a statement, it said: ""Seyi Omooba accepted a lesbian part in our production of The Color Purple knowing full well she would refuse to play this iconic gay role as homosexual. ""We believe the case had no merit from the outset and should never have been brought to the tribunal. ""We now look forward to drawing a line under this painful chapter and focusing our energies on how we rebuild our theatre after the pandemic.""

Lord Frost to join cabinet in trade role,"Boris Johnson has drafted former Brexit negotiator Lord David Frost into his cabinet to take charge of forging a new relationship with the EU. He will seek to maximise post-Brexit trading opportunities when he becomes a full cabinet member next month, Downing Street said. He will also replace Michael Gove as co-chair of a committee on implementing the Brexit withdrawal deal. Mr Gove will keep his seat at the cabinet table. No 10 replaces Frost as National Security Adviser Frost: UK relations with EU 'more than bumpy' Can the Northern Ireland Protocol be tweaked? The change means Mr Gove, who will keep the title of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, will be Lord Frost's new boss at the Cabinet Office. The peer said Mr Gove had done an ""extraordinary job for this country"" in talks with the EU over the past year. In taking over from him as chair of the EU-UK committee tasked with implementing the Brexit deal, he said: ""I stand on the shoulders of giants."" Labour's shadow international trade secretary Emily Thornberry tweeted: ""So we've finally got one minister taking a grip of the problems with our post-Brexit trading relationships with Europe. ""Someone who has never been elected by anyone in this country, and won't be accountable in the House of Commons to any of us who have."" This appointment again shows that Brexit didn't end with the signing of a trade deal. While the UK is no longer a member of the EU, negotiating with Brussels and member states will preoccupy this and future governments for years to come. Since the start of the year (and the end of the transition period) serious tensions have flared up between Westminster and Brussels over trade disruption between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and vaccine supplies. Other issues, such as the City of London's access to EU markets, remain unresolved. Lord Frost will now be the UK minister responsible for co-ordinating all this and it will be a full time job. Rather than responsibility for the EU being shared between several departments - such as the Foreign Office and International Trade - the decision to put Lord Frost in the cabinet and in charge of the Withdrawal Agreement Joint Committee gives him huge clout overseeing policy. It also takes a lot of work away from Michael Gove and means there will be a single minister responsible to parliament for EU relations - although of course he'll be answering questions in the House of Lords and not the Commons. Speaking last week to a select committee, Lord Frost said the UK's relationship with the EU since the trade deal between the two came into force at the start of the year, had been more ""problematic"" and ""bumpy"" than he had expected. He said he hoped we would ""get over this"", but added that it was going to require a ""different spirit"" from Brussels. Lord Frost - who is said to be highly rated by the prime minister - had been due to become the UK's new national security adviser earlier this month, but was replaceddays before he was due to start. He will be the co-chair of the UK-EU joint committee, which was set up to resolve differences arising from the treaty which took the UK out of the EU in February 2020. Since the UK left its Brexit transition period in January, this committee has mainly focused on overcoming trade tensions in Northern Ireland. Unlike the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland is continuing to follow EU single market rules on goods. This provision, agreed as part of the withdrawal agreement, was designed to get rid of the need for checks at the border with the Republic of Ireland. But it has meant checks had to be introduced on some goods travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Since the new rules came into force, there has been tensions at ports in Northern Ireland, with disruption to some food supplies and online deliveries. Lord Frost will also become UK chair of a separate committee being set up to oversee the post-Brexit trade deal he negotiated with Brussels last year. Can the Northern Ireland Protocol be tweaked?

"Devolution not an overall disaster, says PM","This video can not be played The prime minister praised the work at the Cwmbran vaccination centre Devolution has not been an ""overall"" disaster, Boris Johnson has said. Speaking on visit to a vaccination centre in Cwmbran, Torfaen, he said ""it depends"" what the devolved authorities do. Since 1999, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have had more control over their own affairs. The comments come amid debate within the Conservative Party itself about the future of devolution and the union itself. A group of Conservatives were recently selected to stand for the Welsh Parliament after telling members theywould support abolishing the institution. Plaid Cymru Liz Saville Roberts said Mr Johnson's defence of devolution was ""lukewarm"". Mr Johnson's visit also took him to South Wales Police's headquarters in Bridgend, although a Senedd minister questioned whether he should have travelled to Wales given the current lockdown rules. Should Westminster worry about Welsh independence? Is Johnson an asset or a liability for unionism? 'It's difficult to see the benefit of devolution' Asked if he thought devolution had been a disaster, Mr Johnson said: ""Certainly not overall, absolutely not overall."" He said he had been a ""proud beneficiary"" of devolution when he was mayor of London. ""I think that devolution can work very well, but it depends very much on what the devolved authorities do,"" he added. Also while on the visit, Mr Johnson said the UK and Welsh governments were working to ""concert"" their messages on lockdown. In Wales, the National Assembly was set up following a referendum in 1997. Its powers grew and, after a further referendum in 2011, it gained law-making powers and has since changed its name to the Welsh Parliament/Senedd Cymru. Elections to the Senedd determine what ministers form the Welsh Government, which is a separate body currently led by First Minister Mark Drakeford. Boris Johnson visited a vaccination centre in Cwmbran Mr Drakeford has been in charge of Covid-19 restrictions in Wales and has been free to vary the rules from the UK government. The two governments chose to go into lockdown at different times during the winter months and have, at times, disagreed on the messaging to the public. The whole of the UK is now under lockdown, however. Mr Johnson said UK ministers were having ""continuous conversations"" with Mr Drakeford and the two sides tried ""to make sure we concert our approach and concert our general messaging"". ""Overall, if you look at infection rates across the UK, they are coming down a bit now, that's very encouraging.""Mr Johnson added that while there were ""some encouraging signs"" this could be driven by vaccination and it was ""still early days"". The prime minister said a""data not dates"" approachwould be ""absolute right"" in exiting restrictions in England. Mark Drakeford recently partly blamed the UK government's programme of austerity as being behind high rates of coronavirus deaths in parts of the south Wales valleys. Mr Johnson said he would be ""reluctant to ascribe a single cause like that"". ""Yes, sadly, some parts of the UK have been worse hit than than others,"" he said. ""I think that there will be a time where we go over everything and when the pandemic has really come to an end then we try to isolate all the particular causes, but I think it is multifactorial."" A Welsh minister questioned whether Mr Johnson's visit should have gone ahead The UK government was recently warned to avoid""complacency""over the Welsh independence movement. Mr Johnson told journalists that he was ""confident"" about the future of the union, although he said he wasn't complacent. ""I believe passionately in the Union. And I think that its, its advantages are clear."" ""When you see vaccination being rolled out by the NHS invented in the UK, it's impossible not to be very moved and also very confident about the future of our of our country."" Welsh Government Wellbeing Minister Eluned Morgan said she was not sure Mr Johnson's visit could be classed as essential travel. She told a press conference: ""Of course he is the prime minister of the United Kingdom, and has to make his own judgement on that. ""In an ideal world, I think, as many people as possible should stay at home and, yes, in an ideal world, perhaps that should have happened in this instance."" Work is an exception to the stay-at-home lockdown rules. Ms Morgan said the relationship with the UK government had ""ebbed and flowed"". She added: ""In an ideal world, we would like to be coming out of the lockdown together, but at the end of the day we will do what is right for us in Wales, and that will depend on the rates of infection and how quickly we can roll out the vaccine, and we are doing incredibly well in Wales on that score."" Plaid's Liz Saville Roberts also criticised Mr Johnson's visit. ""This was a pointless 140-mile cross-border journey to Wales to make public comment on matters relating to England only,"" she said. ""Mr Johnson's lukewarm defence of devolution is undermined by his actions. This is a Prime Minister who has overseen the biggest Westminster power grab since the advent of devolution and has consistently refused to support Welsh lockdown measures with the financial support needed to make them work.'

Should Westminster worry about Welsh independence?,"In Wales, independence is still a minority view, but a campaign aimed at making it a reality has gained momentum in the past year In the past few years, debate has raged about whether the United Kingdom faces a future without Scotland. Polls have suggested for months thatsupport for Scottish independencehas been higher than for Scotland staying in the UK. In Wales, independence is still a minority view, but a campaign aimed at making it a reality has gained momentum in the past year. Now, a former adviser to David Cameron on devolution says there is ""no room for complacency"" about support for the union in Wales. Lord Dunlop was also commissioned by Theresa May in July 2019 to produce a government review into strengthening the union. Completed more than a year ago, it remains unpublished. Now, as some Labour peers describe the union as ""under threat as never before"", cross-party pressure is mounting on the government to release it. But how ""under threat"" is the union in Wales? January's Welsh Political Barometer poll for ITV Wales and Cardiff University suggested 22% would vote yes if a referendum was held. Most, 53%, told the poll they would say no, while a quarter of respondents said they did not know. Meanwhile, the pro-independence campaign Yes Cymru says its membership has jumped from 2,000 at the start of 2020 tomore than 17,000. This video can not be played The number of people who had attended pre-Covid marches and polls had suggested support for independence is on the rise Elsewhere, rows have broken out between UK and Welsh ministers overwho should control funds replacing EU aid,externaland anew trade lawthat the UK government says will protect Welsh businesses, but critics say will centralise power in London. Welsh ministers have said Westminster-Cardiff relations have worsenedsince Boris Johnson took over from Theresa May - though the UK government says there has been regular engagement on issues such as coronavirus and Brexit. Lord Dunlop says reforming intergovernmental relations is one of the key recommendations in his unpublished report. ""It needs to be less ad hoc, more predictable, a flow of meetings, I think the agendas need to be more about joint decision-making. It needs to feel jointly owned."" He said people in Wales should not get ""carried away by individual polls"" but there was not ""any room for complacency"". ""There's been some suggestion devolution has failed because it hasn't killed nationalism. Whereas my view is devolution isn't a failed project - it's an unfinished project."" He believes making discussions between governments more ""transparent"" would encourage a ""constructive atmosphere to intergovernmental relations rather than the grievance-fest that it has been in the past."" Privately, there are some Conservative MPs pondering if the Dunlop review is now out of date or a bit too ""tame"" to save the union. Other, more devolution-sceptic voices in the party resent talk of more devolution or even phrases like ""four-nations approach"". Lord Dunlop, pictured when he was a frontbencher in the Lords, said relations between the governments needed to be less ad hoc Mrs May's de-facto deputy Sir David Lidington warned her cabinet in the past not to be complacent about Wales. Now outside government, he said while it was ""nice to be flattered"", if Welsh ministers felt relations were better under Mrs May, the UK government should ""give some thought as to what lies behind that"". ""It's not rocket science,"" he said. ""It's allowing enough time for consultation, being open with people, sharing as much information as you can, inviting devolved officials and ministers to some of the cross-departmental committees and Cobra meetings that are sorting out UK-wide policy but have a devolved impact,"" he said. He said that should be ""supported by confidential, private conversations between ministers"". Political analyst Laura McAllister says Welsh independence is a topic on all parties' radars. ""We know at the moment independence in Wales remains a minority interest,"" she said. ""But, and I think this is an important consideration, there is real momentum behind the Yes Cymru campaign and a real sense of growth and energy around it which of course contrasts with those who want to keep the union in place at all costs - because there isn't an energy around that and there isn't a kind of strategic plan either."" Before the coronavirus pandemic Welsh independence marches attracted large crowds, including this gathering in Merthyr Tydfil Behind the scenes in Downing Street, a Welsh special adviser has been working in No 10's union unit over the past few months. It is understood the UK government will soon be hosting regular ""lobby briefings"" for journalists with the Welsh Secretary Simon Hart. Downing Street sources say while their approach is more defensive when it comes to Scotland, the prime minister is excited by opportunities in Wales. One senior UK government source said: ""There's definitely an increased recognition within No 10 that Wales is a strong unionist nation, and that there is an opportunity to build upon the 2019 general election result by levelling up the Welsh communities that have felt left behind by both the Welsh Government and previous UK governments."" Mr Hart has previously said Welsh ministers want to usenew spending powersgranted through the UK Internal Market Act to invest in Wales. In response to recent calls for the Dunlop report to be published, Cabinet Office Minister Michael Gove said it would be published ""in due course"" but it would be alongside a joint review of intergovernmental relations reforms with the devolved administrations. Some parties support independence while one wants devolution ended Meanwhile, Labour have set up a constitutional commission advised by former Prime Minister Gordon Brown to look at devolution across the UK. Labour's Shadow Welsh Secretary Nia Griffith said: ""Unfortunately some comments the prime minister has made has made Wales feels as if it's an afterthought. ""Of course people are saying: 'Would we be better just with our own Welsh Government?' But obviously what we all have to remember is there are so many things we can also do together. ""I think the really important thing is listening to what people are saying. What is it that is making people want independence and what do they mean by independence? ""Do they actually mean the sort of independent decision making that we currently have in Welsh Government? ""Or do they mean completely trying to cut off and have no rapport whatsoever - that's what the first discussion has to be."" Plaid Cymru, the Green Party, Gwlad Gwlad and Propel - if it is registered in time - are standing on an independence platform in May's Welsh parliament elections. Meanwhile, the Abolish the Assembly Party want Welsh devolution abolished completely. Plaid Cymru's Westminster leader Liz Saville Roberts said there was a ""growing realisation the length and breadth of Wales that unless we act, we will be left behind as an appendage to England in a rump UK"". She said that ""for the first time ever, independence will be a key issue going into a Senedd election"".

Lord Frost to join cabinet in trade roleDowning Street says the UK's Brexit negotiator will help forge trade ties with the European Union.UK Politics,"Boris Johnson has drafted former Brexit negotiator Lord David Frost into his cabinet to take charge of forging a new relationship with the EU. He will seek to maximise post-Brexit trading opportunities when he becomes a full cabinet member next month, Downing Street said. He will also replace Michael Gove as co-chair of a committee on implementing the Brexit withdrawal deal. Mr Gove will keep his seat at the cabinet table. No 10 replaces Frost as National Security Adviser Frost: UK relations with EU 'more than bumpy' Can the Northern Ireland Protocol be tweaked? The change means Mr Gove, who will keep the title of Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster, will be Lord Frost's new boss at the Cabinet Office. The peer said Mr Gove had done an ""extraordinary job for this country"" in talks with the EU over the past year. In taking over from him as chair of the EU-UK committee tasked with implementing the Brexit deal, he said: ""I stand on the shoulders of giants."" Labour's shadow international trade secretary Emily Thornberry tweeted: ""So we've finally got one minister taking a grip of the problems with our post-Brexit trading relationships with Europe. ""Someone who has never been elected by anyone in this country, and won't be accountable in the House of Commons to any of us who have."" This appointment again shows that Brexit didn't end with the signing of a trade deal. While the UK is no longer a member of the EU, negotiating with Brussels and member states will preoccupy this and future governments for years to come. Since the start of the year (and the end of the transition period) serious tensions have flared up between Westminster and Brussels over trade disruption between Great Britain and Northern Ireland and vaccine supplies. Other issues, such as the City of London's access to EU markets, remain unresolved. Lord Frost will now be the UK minister responsible for co-ordinating all this and it will be a full time job. Rather than responsibility for the EU being shared between several departments - such as the Foreign Office and International Trade - the decision to put Lord Frost in the cabinet and in charge of the Withdrawal Agreement Joint Committee gives him huge clout overseeing policy. It also takes a lot of work away from Michael Gove and means there will be a single minister responsible to parliament for EU relations - although of course he'll be answering questions in the House of Lords and not the Commons. Speaking last week to a select committee, Lord Frost said the UK's relationship with the EU since the trade deal between the two came into force at the start of the year, had been more ""problematic"" and ""bumpy"" than he had expected. He said he hoped we would ""get over this"", but added that it was going to require a ""different spirit"" from Brussels. Lord Frost - who is said to be highly rated by the prime minister - had been due to become the UK's new national security adviser earlier this month, but was replaceddays before he was due to start. He will be the co-chair of the UK-EU joint committee, which was set up to resolve differences arising from the treaty which took the UK out of the EU in February 2020. Since the UK left its Brexit transition period in January, this committee has mainly focused on overcoming trade tensions in Northern Ireland. Unlike the rest of the UK, Northern Ireland is continuing to follow EU single market rules on goods. This provision, agreed as part of the withdrawal agreement, was designed to get rid of the need for checks at the border with the Republic of Ireland. But it has meant checks had to be introduced on some goods travelling between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Since the new rules came into force, there has been tensions at ports in Northern Ireland, with disruption to some food supplies and online deliveries. Lord Frost will also become UK chair of a separate committee being set up to oversee the post-Brexit trade deal he negotiated with Brussels last year. Can the Northern Ireland Protocol be tweaked?

Deaths mount as US storm causes major power cuts,"This video can not be played Frozen turbines and climate change: The politics behind the Texas power failure A huge winter storm sweeping across the southern US has killed at least 21 people and left millions without power. There have been widespread blackouts in Texas, where the energy grid was overwhelmed by a surge in demand. Millions of people in the state, which rarely experiences such low temperatures, have been struggling to cope with the lack of power and frigid conditions. The extreme weather is forecast to continue until the weekend. Deaths attributed to the storm have been recorded in Texas, Louisiana, Kentucky, North Carolina and Missouri. How to stay safe in freezing weather Are frozen wind turbines to blame? In pictures: Snow blankets Texas Why is Texas seeing Arctic temperatures? How long will the storm last? By Wednesday afternoon, the National Weather Service (NWS) said that the worst of the storm had moved through Texas, but kept more than 100 million Americans under a winter weather warning. But historically low temperatures are expected to remain for days, the NWS said, with more than 71% of the US covered by snow. This video can not be played Winter storm leaves millions of Texas residents without electricity The freezing storm has even reached northern and central parts of Mexico, where millions of people have experienced days of intermittent power cuts. ""I'm in Houston, Texas freezing to death,"" one Twitter user, Chris Prince, wrote. ""No power, no heat, no water. I have four young children. How is this happening right now?"" Another user, Josh Morgerman, wrote that a friend in Texas had resorted to ""burning furniture in the fireplace"" to stay warm. Texas family 'trying to keep warm' A senior director for Ercot - the Electric Reliability Council of Texas - told CNN on Wednesday that Texans could continue to experience rotating power outages into Thursday. Rotating outages are the ""best case"" scenario, Dan Woodfin said. ""I don't think it's likely that we're going to have enough available based on our forecasts... and that we're going to have everybody back on today, or before at least the morning peak tomorrow"". Scientists have linked climate change to an increasing number of severe weather events worldwide, including hurricanes, heat waves and floods. The recorded deaths include people who have died in traffic accidents, as well as some who suffered carbon monoxide poisoning from running cars and generators indoors to stay warm. ""This is an absolute public health disaster,"" one medical official in Houston told the local television station KPRC-TV. ""[Carbon monoxide poisoning] certainly happens when it gets cold, but never in these numbers. Queues have formed at shops in Texas where many are unused to freezing temperatures One county said it had seen more than 300 suspected carbon monoxide cases during the cold snap. ""It's turning into a mini mass casualty event,"" one Harris County doctor told the Houston Chronicle. At least four people were killed following a house fire in Houston that officials said may have been sparked by candles. Separately, police said two men found alongside a Houston highway were believed to have died due to the cold. Meanwhile in North Carolina, a tornado spawned by the same storm left three people dead and 10 injured. The cold snap has also forced Covid-19 vaccination centres to close for several days and hindered deliveries of doses in a handful of US states. Some centres raced to use vaccines that could no longer be refrigerated at the required temperature. The state has seen some of its coldest temperatures in more than 30 years - some areas hit 0F (-18C) on Sunday - and US President Joe Biden earlier approved a state of emergency. Many hotels in Texas are full with people who have no electricity at home Some two million people in Texas are still without power. At a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, Governor Greg Abbott said that 1.2 million Texans have so far had their power restored, with more coming ""on board"". The governor signed an executive order preventing any Texas natural gas from being exported outside of the state until 21 February. Mr Abbott also told reporters that every source of power in Texas had been ""compromised"" - seemingly walking back earlier comments blaming renewable energy for the state's blackouts. The scale of the power outage has prompted anger from some officials and residents. Mr Abbott has called the situation ""unacceptable"". He called for an investigation into the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (Ercot), an energy co-operative responsible for the vast majority of the state's electricity to get to the ""root of any missteps"" that led to the widespread outages. He has told local media that the body should be reformed and its leaders should resign. ""This was a total failure,"" he told ABC News. ""They showed that they were not reliable."" In a tweet on Tuesday, Ercot said it was ""restoring load as fast as we can in a stable manner"". The snow and ice triggered a flurry of traffic accidents - such as this one in Pierce, Texas Homes in the state are not normally insulated for cold weather, meaning that indoor temperatures in homes quickly dropped to freezing after heat systems failed. Frozen pipes also burst, despite attempts by some homeowners to insulate them from the cold using blankets. Chuck Hairston, who lives in a suburb of Fort Worth, had been without electricity for about 31 hours when he spoke to the BBC on Tuesday. Neighbourhoods like this one in Pflugerville faced many hours without electricity He said his family had slept beside the fireplace covered in ""every blanket and pillow we could find in the house"". He tried local hotels, but they were either fully booked or did not have electricity. Icy roads have also led to a spate of traffic accidents and people have been advised to avoid travel where possible. How are you coping with the freezing conditions where you are?

Accountancy firm KPMG creates 200 jobs in Belfast,"Accountancy firm KPMG is creating 200 jobs in a new ""centre of excellence"" in Belfast. The Â£14m investment will deliver services in cyber security, applied intelligence and digital transformation. This will benefit clients in the UK and the Republic of Ireland. Some 160 of the roles will be involved in the Assured Skills Training Programme with Belfast Met aimed at graduates over the next three years. Johnny Hanna, partner in charge of KPMG in Northern Ireland, said: ""The creation of the new centre of excellence is the next step in the evolution of KPMG in Northern Ireland. ""We have continually grown the firm to meet the ever-changing demands of our clients and the addition of this digital centre adds an exciting offering, which will have global reach."" He also said the new post-Brexit trading arrangements in Northern Ireland offered ""lots of opportunities"". While acknowledging some disruption in the first weeks of operation of the Northern Ireland Protocol, he said he was optimistic issues would be resolved quickly. ""We all recognise that there are many challenges at the moment and the disruptions - we're going to need to address some of them, certainly on the GB-NI part of it. ""But there's lots of opportunities would be my view - I think once things settle down and we get a bit of time."" He said the protocol, which gives Northern Ireland companies unfettered access to sell into both the Great Britain and EU markets, could prove beneficial but added this latest investment was not linked to Brexit. The Department for the Economy is funding almost Â£1.3m of training over three years. Economy Minister Diane Dodds said the jobs would contribute more than Â£7m a year in salaries. ""This investment also reinforces KPMG's confidence in Northern Ireland as a key business location post-EU Exit,"" she added.

Footballer's wife wants anti-Irish abuse to end,"James McClean has played for Sunderland, Wigan Athletic and West Bromwich Albion since leaving his hometown club Derry City Republic of Ireland footballer James McClean has welcomed political support he has received over online abuse directed towards him and his family. Earlier this week Stoke City's McClean, 31, shared an Instagram message that threatened to set his family home on fire, in a string of abusive messages. NI First Minister and DUP leader Arlene Foster was among politicians who condemned the abuse. ""All I am asking for is people to respect my views,"" Mr McClean said. Speaking to BBC Radio Foyle, the footballer from Derry's Creggan estate said: ""I welcome the support because it's not a green or orange thing or a point-scoring thing. It is about anti-Irish abuse and how it's been over decades. ""Fellow players have backed me and even today Arlene Foster from the DUP, Michelle O'Neill from Sinn FÃ©in and the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister), MicheÃ¡l Martin. ""It is no longer acceptable and people need to stand up and speak out against it because it's been going on for far too long."" Northern Ireland's Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill expressed her solidarity with the family and said footballing authorities ""must take immediate action to tackle the scourge of anti-Irish racism"". Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken also said that ""too many of the people indulging in such abuse are able to hide behind anonymous online accounts"". On Wednesday, the Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin also tweeted his support for the McClean family, congratulating them for ""speaking out about years of horrific abuse they've suffered online"". Glentoran defender Patrick McClean has also been the subject of online abuse, James McClean has said Mr McClean also told the programme that his brother, Patrick McClean, who plays for Northern Ireland Football League club Glentoran, has also been the subject of online abuse. Death threats and spat at - McClean on life in the public eye The Football Association of Ireland issued a statement on Monday offering itssupport to McClean and his family and also condemned the abuse. The Professional Footballers' Association and McClean's club Stoke City have also condemned the abuse. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Tsitsipas knocks out Nadal in thriller,"This video can not be played Tsitsipas defeats Nadal after incredible comeback Rafael Nadal saw his bid for a 21st Grand Slam title end as Greek fifth seed Stefanos Tsitsipas fought back from two sets down to reach the Australian Open semi-finals. The Spanish second seed, 34, was stunned as Tsitsipas claimed a 3-6 2-6 7-6 (7-4) 6-4 7-5 victory in Melbourne. Tsitsipas, 22, broke out into a huge smile, almost in disbelief, after converting his third match point. Tsitsipas will face Russia's Daniil Medvedev in Friday's semi-final. Fourth seed Medvedev beat compatriot Andrey Rublev to reach the last four at the Australian Open for the first time. The 25-year-old won 7-5 6-3 6-2 as his childhood friend Rublev, who was seeded seventh, struggled in the 29C temperatures at Melbourne Park. ATP Finals champion Medvedev now puts a 19-match unbeaten streak on the line against Tsitsipas, who needed over four hours to overcome Nadal. ""I'm speechless, I have no words to describe what just happened on court,"" said Tsitsipas, who was still out of breath in his on-court interview. ""My tennis speaks for itself. It is an unbelievable feeling to fight at such a level and give it my all on the court. ""I started very nervous, I won't lie. I don't know what happened after the third set. I flew like a little bird. ""Everything worked for me and the feelings are indescribable."" Nadal v Tsitsipas quarter-final - as it happened World number one Barty stunned by Muchova Preview: Williams to face Osaka for place in final Nadal says tennis season must continue Few would have predicted this outcome between Tsitsipas and Nadal going into the match - and even fewer after the opening two sets. Tsitsipas looked befuddled by Nadal's presence, clean-hitting and court-craft, with 20 unforced errors coming off the Greek's racquet to put the Spaniard in command. The pair met two years ago in Melbourne when Nadal allowed Tsitsipas just six games in a one-sided semi-final. After that match, a despondent Tsitsipas talked about how Nadal had a unique ""talent"" of making his opponents ""play bad"". Initially, it appeared to be a case of deja vu. This time, however, Tsitsipas remained composed and dragged Nadal into a physical battle which proved beyond him. Tsitsipas had lost six of his seven previous meetings with Nadal, claiming his only victory on the Madrid clay in 2019 Tsitsipas cut out the errors in the third set and, although he did not win a point in Nadal's service games, pounced in the pivotal tie-break when the Spaniard missed two overhead smashes and miscued another return. ""I focused a lot on staying calm and holding my nerves, it is a very important element for me,"" said Tsitsipas. ""I have failed to do it in some of my matches. A big part of my win was staying calm in the crucial tight moments."" With increasing confidence as momentum turned, Tsitsipas pushed Nadal further back on the court and applied serious pressure on his service games as the Spaniard began to miss shots. Tsitsipas served out the fourth set after crucially breaking for 5-4 following another Nadal forehand error, then took his serve to love for 6-5 in a tense decider. Nerves crept in as Nadal threatened to ensure a final-set tie-breaker would settle a thrilling match, only for Tsitsipas to regain his focus and seal a famous victory. ""My mood was consistent and I have been trying to keep everything to myself. I'm happy with my attitude on court,"" he said. Nadal won his 20th Grand Slam title at the French Open in October and had the opportunity in Melbourne to overhaul Roger Federer's once-seemingly untouchable men's record for the first time. After dismantling Tsitsipas's game with powerful and precise hitting in the opening two sets, Nadal's level dropped as his opponent's increased. Nadal showed no signs of the back injury which ruled him out of the warm-up ATP Cup, but questions will be asked about whether a lack of match practice - and, perhaps, his ageing body - played a part in his younger opponent outlasting him. Nadal's only other defeat in a Grand Slam match after winning the first two sets came against Italian Fabio Fognini at the 2015 US Open ""I can't find a lot of excuses or reasons,"" said Nadal, whose only triumph in Melbourne came in 2009. ""It was a little bit of everything. I missed a couple of balls in the tie-break that I could not miss if I want to win. And that's it. ""I should be ready to play four hours. I think my physical shape holds up quite well. ""But it is true that I probably needed a little bit more time because I was in great shape and for 20 days I was not able to practise the way that I expected, not able to play one single match in ATP Cup."" Only once had Nadal previously lost a Grand Slam match after winning the first two sets and, after being broken to love for Tsitsipas to serve for the match, looked stunned as he sat on his chair and shook his head. While he regrouped and had chances to break back to force a final-set tie-break, there were few complaints from the Spaniard. ""Stefanos played better than me probably in important moments. It was an equal match,"" he added. Daniil Medvedev has now reached three Grand Slam semi-finals By beating Rublev - one of the most in-form players on the ATP Tour over the past year - Medvedev extended his run of wins against top-10 players to 11 matches. The Russian pair were closely matched in a competitive first set, trading breaks before Medvedev took the opener as 23-year-old Rublev was broken to love. Rublev particularly struggled with the humidity, at one point sitting down on his box of towels after a gruelling 43-shot rally. Both players were breathing deeply as the match progressed but it was Medvedev, who has improved his fitness in his rise to the top 10, who dealt with the conditions better. Medvedev sealed victory on his first match point to reach his third career Grand Slam semi-final, although there was a slight concern when he called for the trainer at the end of the match after getting cramp in his left thigh. ""It was one of the best matches I've played lately,"" Medvedev said. ""This match is really unbelievable.""

House prices up 8.5% in 2020 amid tax holiday,"UK house prices climbed 8.5% in 2020, the highest annual growth rate since October 2014, according to official figures. The average UK house price reached a record high of Â£252,000 in December 2020, the Office for National Statistics said. The North West had the highest growth of 11.2%, while London rose just 3.5%. The stamp duty holiday due to end this March contributed to the rise, the ONS said. Spending more time at home in the pandemic meant some people also decided they needed more space. That was reflected in the average price of detached properties climbing by twice as much as flats and maisonettes during 2020, up 10% and 5% respectively. Meanwhile Wales experienced the fastest price growth, with property values rising 10.7% to Â£184,000. In England, prices climbed 8.5% to Â£269,000, in Scotland, 8.4% to Â£163,000 and in Northern Ireland 5.3% to Â£148,000. ""Recent price increases may reflect a range of factors including pent-up demand, some possible changes in housing preferences since the pandemic and a response to the changes made to property transaction taxes across the nations,"" the ONS said. The UK housing market is made up of lots of local markets, with different factors affecting property prices such as the performance of schools and the availability of jobs. The ONS figures are based on sale completions. Although average London prices were up by 3.5%, over last year, prices fell in the capital by Â£5,000 between November and December, despite a UK-wide price increase of 1.2% over the month. But the city still has the highest average house price in the UK, at Â£496,000. The North East continued to have the lowest average house price at Â£141,000, and has become the final English region to surpass its pre-economic downturn peak of July 2007. ""2020 was the year that fundamentals came home to roost,"" said Nicky Stevenson, managing director at estate agent Fine & Country. ""There was no escaping a lack of space for households who suddenly found they were living on top of each other with little respite. That has powered annual growth that reached a six-year high."" There were four major drivers of overall house price rises in 2020, said Anna Clare Harper, chief executive of asset manager SPI Capital. ""The temporary stamp duty reduction and cheap debt as a result of very low interest rates, which give buyers a 'discount'; the release of pent-up supply and demand and desire to improve surroundings amongst existing homeowners; and the 'flight to safety', since in times of uncertainty, people want to keep their money in a stable asset with low volatility. ""But looking to the future when the temporary stamp duty reduction ends, we're likely to see a slowdown in house price rises,"" she said. ""However, there is still some life in the market as lockdown helps to concentrate many potential buyers and sellers' minds as far as moving is concerned,"" said north London estate agent Jeremy Leaf. ""Intense speculation remains as to whether the 31 March stamp duty deadline will be extended and we can't help but have sympathy for many who have started the process several months ago who have been unavoidably delayed by a backlog in searches, surveys, conveyancing, or all three, to say nothing of problems in the new-build industry.""

Campaigners granted hearing over Stonehenge tunnelProtesters are seeking a judicial review of the Â£1.7bn project over fears of the impact on the site.,"Campaigners against the tunnel have labelled it a ""complete violation"" and ""international scandal"" Campaigners challenging the approval of a road tunnel near Stonehenge have been granted a court hearing to allow the decision to be scrutinised. Save Stonehenge World Heritage Site (SSWHS) is seeking permission for a judicial review of the Â£1.7bn project. The hearing will determine whether a review should be granted and will take place at the High Court, with a date likely to be set next week. SSWHS believes the scheme will have a detrimental impact on the ancient site. Transport Secretary Grant Shappsapproved the scheme in Novemberagainst the recommendations of planning officials. The tunnel is part of a Â£1.7bn investment in the A303 between Amesbury and Berwick Down He said the need for the development ""outweighed any harm"" that might be caused. Wiltshire Council backed the decision to approve the plans, with leader Philip Whitehead saying he saw it as a solution to ""horrendous"" traffic in villages near the A303. But SSWHS said the two-mile (3.2km) tunnel along the A303 will cause ""significant harm"" to the area, andraised Â£50,000 in order to apply for a judicial review. The SSWHS is part of The Stonehenge Alliance, a coalition of groups fighting the tunnel plans. Its president, Tom Holland, said: ""We have always believed that the government's intention to build a great gash of concrete and tarmac through the World Heritage Site is a dereliction of its responsibilities, and we are delighted that there will now be the opportunity to test this conviction in a court of law. ""We urge Grant Shapps to review his decision and act to conserve rather than vandalise this most precious of prehistoric landscapes."" The road tunnel has the backing of Wiltshire Council, English Heritage, the National Trust and Historic England Solicitor Rowan Smith, acting for SSWHS, said although there was ""a huge level of public outrage"", the case must proceed on the basis of ""procedural error"". ""Today's decision means that our client's case and the government's decision-making process will now be fully scrutinised by the courts,"" he said. The project, expected to take five years to complete, is scheduled to get under way in 2023. The Department for Transport has been approached for comment.

'My traumatic four-year wait for justice',"Four years to wait for her day in court: Jenny's story sounds extreme - but not exceptional The backlog in the Crown Courts has hit a record of 56,000 cases - meaning some cases are now being timetabled for 2023. The Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary Robert Buckland - the cabinet minister in charge of the courts - is promising that a recovery plan will bring justice. But will those plans make a difference to victims waiting for their voices to be heard? If you want to know what it feels like to wait for justice for a serious crime, consider the limbo that ""Jenny"" finds herself in. For legal reasons, the BBC is not revealing any details of the case but, put briefly, she quietly and secretly coped for years with having been the victim of serious sexual violence. When the #MeToo movement took hold, she decided that she too had to speak out. In 2018 detectives video-recorded Jenny's allegations and, after a long and complex investigation, the Crown Prosecution Service concluded last summer that her abuser should be charged with serious offences. Jenny agreed not to begin deep trauma therapy because it may affect her evidence in court. Last autumn, she learned when her abuser would face trial - and she was devastated. Weeping, she recalled her conversation with the police officer. ""The first court hearing and second court hearing were really close to each other. And so that gave me some faith, I thought it's taken this long to get to this point. But actually, maybe this next bit isn't going to be as long. ""I was asked... to provide dates of availability for court for the next nine months. So I thought, it's just another nine months. I can do this. And then I got the call - and they gave me the date. It was 2022. ""I said down the phone, 'You do mean 2021?' And they said, 'No, we mean, 2022.' And I got really angry. How can anyone believe that that is acceptable that you keep somebody in trauma and you don't give them the access [to the therapy] that they need?"" Every week since has been a rollercoaster - to the point that Jenny cannot currently work and her family are rallying around to support her as she tries to comprehend the absence of justice. ""I start having a panic attack in the middle of town, I can't breathe. My body goes tight. I start convulsing, I'm sometimes sick, I'm shaking, I'm wailing. Trying to understand, why is that happening? ""There have been two occasions where I felt suicidal. The second time was when I was told the trial would be 2022. ""I felt like I'd been let down by the state. This was the whole system letting me down."" Jenny 's experience sounds extreme - but it is not exceptional, because of the enormous delays in criminal justice. Last month the watchdogs that report on the police, prosecution, prisons and probation all agreed that the backlog in Crown Courts of 54,000 caseswas of grave concern. In the last week, it's hit an all-time record of 56,000. There was a backlog in the Crown Courts before the pandemic hit. Coronavirus made operations far harder because many courtrooms are too small to safely distance everyone who needs to be inside. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Buckland has defended the government's attempts to tackle these record backlogs. He has promised that his court recovery plan will work - but it will take time. Today, he's announcing 14 more temporary ""Nightingale Courts"" - converted spaces and hotel conference facilities that are part of Â£113m of spending to alleviate the pressure. Part of Manchester Crown Court will be knocked through to create a new ""super court"" for large socially-distanced gang trials. About 20,000 monthly remote video hearings - not without some technical problems - are already part of the court process. ""I think we're virtually at the limit of what we think is feasible, we continue to look to see what more can be done,"" he says. ""But I think the key now is, it's not just about capacity, it's about getting cases listed. Working with [judges], I think that we can make solid progress this year."" A court sketch from a major trial at the Old Bailey shows some of the measures that have been put in place to allow justice to continue The Criminal Bar Association says new spaces are not enough - they need to be staffed. In 2009-10, the budget for Crown Courts in England and Wales meant judges could ""sit"" for more than 108,000 days. Last year, it was 86,000. That roughly equates to only 45% of available court space being used, before the pandemic hit. Mr Buckland says reductions in ""sitting days"" were driven by projections of falling levels of crime. His critics say it was also a political decision to deliver cuts. He is now promising a huge increase in sitting days - above 100,000 - in effect a return to where the courts were. ""I'm working out the number of days to be agreed with the Lord Chief Justice,"" he says. ""But I can assure everybody that that number [of sitting days] will be significantly in advance of 82,000 to many, many tens of thousands of days above that."" This video can not be played WATCH: Two young lawyers share their concerns about the profession It's worth noting that before he became a minister, Mr Buckland sat as a part-time Crown Court judge. So what does he say to victims like Jenny who are in limbo? ""That case is a dramatic example of a number of cases that concern me. I don't want to see victims and witnesses having to wait an inordinate length of time. I can understand her perspective. ""I accept what you say about the huge frustrations and the anxiety and the concern that is out there. But I'm doing everything I can to mitigate those problems."" One of the most significant changes has been the extension of the option of pre-trial video-recorded testimony and cross-examination for vulnerable victims and witnesses - in essence allowing them to give evidence long before a court hears the case. The government has also pledgedan extra Â£40m to support vulnerable people,externalwaiting for trial - including Â£16m for more independent sexual violence advisers - specialists who have been instrumental in supporting Jenny as she waits for justice. Jenny meanwhile has been given permission by prosecutors to get additional help - but she can't get the specific deep counselling that could help her because the waiting list in her part of the country is staggeringly long. ""I'm resilient. I've got support. What about individuals who have got no family, no friends?"" she says. ""How many of those have walked away? Not because a crime didn't happen, but because the system hasn't enabled their voice to come out? ""The system is not broken because of Covid. It was well broken before that. And you might put your Nightingale courts up and running, but you need to go back to asking: what do the victims need?""

""But I can assure everybody that that number [of sitting days] will be significantly in advance of 82,000 to many, many tens of thousands of days above that.""

'Self-isolation cost my family Â£700 in a month',"Tracy Moore and her husband Jason lost hundreds of pounds when they were told to isolate Self-isolation is costing people who do not qualify for financial support hundreds of pounds in lost income. Most applications to Wales' Â£500 self-isolation grant scheme have been rejected. The Welsh Government announced on Wednesday it is expanding the scheme to make more people eligible. Tracy Moore, from Flintshire, saw her household income fall about Â£700 last month, andtold BBC Wales Livethe way the support system worked was ""wrong"". Since the coronavirusself-isolation support programmeopened in November, 27,209 applications have been made in Wales. Of those, 8,421 were approved, 15,772 rejected and 3,016 had a decision pending as of 2 February. Will I get paid if I self-isolate? Covid self-isolation shortened to 10 days Payment for people told to isolate by app in Wales Self-isolation without grant 'a kick in the teeth' The Welsh Government said feedback from councils suggested rejected applications were mainly due to individuals being ineligible or not providing the necessary evidence. Under the existing system, applicants must stand to lose income by isolating, and be on at least one of a range of benefits. The government is now expanding the scheme to include people not on any benefits but with a personal income of less than Â£500 net per week or on basic statutory sick pay. Ministers said the changes would make an additional 170,000 people potentially eligible for the grant, with the scheme extended to June. The new rules will not be backdated. Ms Moore, from Holywell, saw her household income drop by about Â£700 when her husband Jason and son isolated last month. They work for a Tarmac company and shared their van with someone who tested positive the following day. They called 111 and were advised to isolate for 10 days. But when they tried to apply for financial help they were told they were not eligible as they had not formally been asked to isolate by Test, Trace, Protect. Another 111 call handler later said they should not have been told to isolate. People living in Wales and England have been urged to download the NHS contact-tracing app Ms Moore is disabled and does not work, so the household income took a hit. ""The bills have all been paid but it was not very nice. The way the system works is disgusting and wrong,"" she said. Lynette Jackson, from Wrexham, lost about Â£400 when she isolated in the run-up to Christmas after a colleague at her factory tested positive. When she applied for a discretionary payment she was told she was too late as 17 days had passed since her isolation ended. ""I did what I was meant to do. I think people will stop doing it if they're losing money,"" she said. ""I would only isolate again in the future if I'm ill, I can't afford to do it again."" One self-employed woman from Cardiff said she would not qualify for the grant so is avoiding getting tested and will ignore calls from contact tracers. ""I've done everything to avoid being told to isolate,"" she added. ""If it's a choice between paying rent and bills vs self-isolating I'm going to pay the bills."" But Helen Harris, from Newport, did receive the payment and said it was a ""such a relief"", with her baby Arwen currently in hospital for heart treatment. Helen is on maternity leave and her husband Andrew lost about Â£700 when they had to isolate. This video can not be played People may not isolate if they have financial worries, Helen Harris says ""I've been completely worried anyway... and then obviously we had the financial worries about if we could keep the house, if we could pay the bills,"" she said. ""It's just a massive weight off our mind, it's just something we don't have to worry about because it means that the money's now there for us to pay the bills that we need."" Ms Harris said she felt for people who are not given the grant. ""The government should definitely be supporting people because people are struggling with mental health and everything, they need to know they can pay their bills,"" she added. A Swansea University study of people asked to self-isolate in Wales found more than a quarter of those surveyed said it negatively affected their income. Local government minister Julie James said feedback from councils showed the scheme was working well, but lack of income was still being reported as a barrier for self-isolating. ""Self-isolation is key if we are to stop the spread of coronavirus and with more community testing programmes planned in the coming months it is vital we enhance the scheme to help more people self-isolate and receive the financial support they need,"" she said. Plaid Cymru's shadow minister for finance and health, Rhun ap Iorwerth, said: ""Self-isolation remains a vital part of stopping the spread of coronavirus, and fear of financial hardship is one of the barriers to effective self-isolation. ""If support isn't sufficient, and isn't reaching the right people, our efforts to tackle the pandemic suffer."" He called for the payment to be brought up to Â£800 and said it will be an ""important step"" in tackling the virus as we come out of lockdown. More on this story on Wales Live on BBC One Wales at 22:35 GMT on Wednesday The pandemic has had a huge impact on people's day-to-day lives in Wales, with mental health problems worsening across different age groups in the past year.

Self-isolation payments extended to parents,"Parents whose children were self-isolating were not able to claim the grant Self-isolation payments are being extended to include parents and carers on low incomes whose children have to self-isolate. The move by the Welsh Government comes after some parents told BBC Wales they werestruggling to pay billsbecause they did not have access to the grants. The payment will be extended from next Monday. It is currently only available to people who were forced to stay off work because they tested positive for Covid. 'No help' for single parents as children isolate Extra support call for Welsh Covid hotspots Health Minister Vaughan Gething said the payment ""will provide parents and carers on low incomes with the financial support they need while they look after their children"". Applications for the Â£500 grants, set up to support those on low incomes, opened in November following criticism of adelayin getting it up and running. People can access the grant if they test positive or are contacted by contact tracers, and cannot work from home during the 14 day self-isolation period. Plaid Cymru economy spokeswoman Helen Mary Jones said she was pleased to hear the change will be implemented. But she called for assurances from the Welsh Government that it will look at other barriers, both financial and practical, that people face when needing to self-isolate.

Court hearing over Stonehenge road tunnel granted,"Campaigners against the tunnel have labelled it a ""complete violation"" and ""international scandal"" Campaigners challenging the approval of a road tunnel near Stonehenge have been granted a court hearing to allow the decision to be scrutinised. Save Stonehenge World Heritage Site (SSWHS) is seeking permission for a judicial review of the Â£1.7bn project. The hearing will determine whether a review should be granted and will take place at the High Court, with a date likely to be set next week. SSWHS believes the scheme will have a detrimental impact on the ancient site. Transport Secretary Grant Shappsapproved the scheme in Novemberagainst the recommendations of planning officials. The tunnel is part of a Â£1.7bn investment in the A303 between Amesbury and Berwick Down He said the need for the development ""outweighed any harm"" that might be caused. Wiltshire Council backed the decision to approve the plans, with leader Philip Whitehead saying he saw it as a solution to ""horrendous"" traffic in villages near the A303. But SSWHS said the two-mile (3.2km) tunnel along the A303 will cause ""significant harm"" to the area, andraised Â£50,000 in order to apply for a judicial review. The SSWHS is part of The Stonehenge Alliance, a coalition of groups fighting the tunnel plans. Its president, Tom Holland, said: ""We have always believed that the government's intention to build a great gash of concrete and tarmac through the World Heritage Site is a dereliction of its responsibilities, and we are delighted that there will now be the opportunity to test this conviction in a court of law. ""We urge Grant Shapps to review his decision and act to conserve rather than vandalise this most precious of prehistoric landscapes."" The road tunnel has the backing of Wiltshire Council, English Heritage, the National Trust and Historic England Solicitor Rowan Smith, acting for SSWHS, said although there was ""a huge level of public outrage"", the case must proceed on the basis of ""procedural error"". ""Today's decision means that our client's case and the government's decision-making process will now be fully scrutinised by the courts,"" he said. The project, expected to take five years to complete, is scheduled to get under way in 2023. The Department for Transport has been approached for comment.

Ford to go all-electric in Europe by 2030,"A Ford Explorer hybrid SUV Carmaker Ford has said its passenger vehicle line-up in Europe will be all-electric by 2030. By the middle of 2026, all its cars will be available as electric or hybrid models, it added. It joins a growing list of car brands cutting petrol and diesel production, including Jaguar and Bentley. European regulators are clamping down on emissions, with countries including UK planning to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel motors. Ford said it would spend $1bn (Â£720m) updating its factory in Cologne, with the aim of producing a mass-market electric vehicle by 2023. Jaguar car brand to be all-electric by 2025 Electric car battery plant plan for airport ""Our announcement today to transform our Cologne facility, the home of our operations in Germany for 90 years, is one of the most significant Ford has made in over a generation,"" said Stuart Rowley, president of Ford in Europe. ""It underlines our commitment to Europe and a modern future with electric vehicles at the heart of our strategy for growth."" Ford is the largest carmaker to make such an announcement in Europe, holding a 15% share of the regional market. On Monday, Jaguar Land Rover said its cars would be all-electric by 2030, with its Jaguar brand electrified by 2025. GM and Volvo Cars have set similarly ambitious targets. This year car makers in the EU will face hefty fines if they fail to meet emissions standards. The UK meanwhile has said it plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, with France is targeting the same by 2040. David Leggett, automotive analyst at GlobalData, said: ""Automotive electrification is an expensive proposition for vehicle manufacturers, but they are nevertheless concluding that they must take the investment hit to be well-positioned competitively later this decade when the end for new internal combustion engine vehicle sales will be in sight in a number of markets."" On Tuesday it emerged that Coventry Airportcould be the site for a gigafactory- a plant to manufacture electric car batteries. The UK government previously announced Â£500m funding as part of a ten point plan to support the electrification of vehicles, including developing gigafactories across the UK.

"Hospital waiting list 'may double to 10m by April'There could be a surge in demand from delayed referrals and delays to treatment, a think tank warns.HealthComments","Waiting lists for hospital treatment could more than double by April and hit 10 million in England, the Reform think tank is warning.

Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said ""trumpeting worst-case scenarios"" was ""not helpful"". He said while there was a ""significant problem"" which would take time and investment to overcome, a similar methodology had suggested waiting lists would hit 10 million by December last year, but they were currently at 4.4 million.

"UN to raise Princess Latifa case with UAEThe detention of the daughter of Dubai's ruler was also described as ""deeply troubling"" by the UK.","This video can not be played Videos show Dubai's Princess Latifa in ""villa jail"" The United Nations has said it will raise the detention of Princess Latifa, the daughter of Dubai's ruler, with the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Princess Latifa has accused her father of holding her hostage in Dubai since she tried to flee the city in 2018. In secretly recorded videos shared with the BBC, Princess Latifa said she feared for her life. The footage prompted global calls for a UN investigation, while the UK said the videos were ""deeply troubling"". ""We are concerned about it,"" UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said on Wednesday. He said the videos showed ""a young woman in deep distress"", adding that the UK would watch any developments from the UN ""very closely"". This video can not be played ""I've seen some of the footage and it's deeply troubling"" â UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab But when asked whether sanctions could be imposed, Mr Raab said: ""It's not clear to me that there would be the evidence to support that."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson also said the government was ""concerned"" but would ""wait and see how [the UN] get on"" with their investigation. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has said it would soon question the UAE about Princess Latifa. ""We will certainly raise these new developments with the UAE,"" spokesman Rupert Colville said. ""Other parts of the UN human rights system with relevant mandates may also become involved once they have analysed the new material"". Meanwhile, a spokesman said the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention could launch an investigation once Princess Latifa's videos have been analysed. Dubai's Princess Latifa before her escape attempt in 2018 ""We are hoping [a UN investigation] will be decisive in finally getting Princess Latifa released,"" Rodney Dixon, a lawyer who presented the case to the UN, told the BBC. ""The UN needs to have a very serious meeting directly with those who are holding [her] and make sure an agreement is reached so she can be released,"" he said. Mr Dixon added: ""The UN as the international body responsible for implementing international law can ensure that is exactly what happens."" Princess Latifa's father, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, is one of the richest heads of state in the world, the ruler of Dubai and vice-president of the UAE. The UAE has close relations with a number of Western countries, including the US and UK, which consider it a strategic ally. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum is the 71-year-old billionaire ruler of Dubai Sheikh Mohammed has built a hugely successful city but rights activists say there is no tolerance of dissent and the judicial system can discriminate against women. With the help of friends, Princess Latifa tried to flee Dubai to start a new life in February 2018. ""I'm not allowed to drive, I'm not allowed to travel or leave Dubai at all,"" she said in a video recorded just before her escape. What are women's rights in Dubai? The princess who vanished Timeline: Failed escapes of sheikh's daughters Sheikh Mohammed Al Maktoum: Who is Dubai's ruler? But days later, the princess was captured by commandos on a boat in the Indian Ocean. She was flown back to Dubai, where she has remained ever since. Her father said he was acting in her best interests. Dubai and the UAE have previously said Princess Latifa was safe in the care of family. Ashitha Nagesh, BBC News Women in the UAE are allowed to drive, vote, work, and own and inherit property, making the country the second-best in the Middle East and North Africa (Mena) for gender equality,according to the World Economic Forum,external(WEF). But, to put this in context, the Mena region had the lowest score of all the regions. The UAE was ranked 120th in the world out of 153. There are still aspects of a woman's personal life in the country that are controlled by a male ""guardian"" - often a spouse or other male relative. Although the UAE isn't as strict as neighbouring Saudi Arabia, women still need their guardian's permission in order to get married. Divorce is also much harder for women; men don't need permission but women have to apply for a court order. And while the UAE does have an anti-discrimination law, sex and gender aren't included in its protected categories. Some laws have changed in the last few years, at least on the surface. An explicit permission for domestic violence was removed from the penal code in 2016. The requirement in the personal status law for women to ""obey"" their husbands was revoked in 2019, and the law was amended to make its language more gender-neutral. And last March a new law allowing women access to protection orders - such as restraining orders - came into effect. However, the new law defines domestic violence as abuse or threats that ""exceed [an individual's] guardianship, jurisdiction, authority or responsibility"", meaning it's ultimately down to judges to decide whether men have gone beyond their ""authority"" or not. In practice, protections for abuse victims are still weak. Sheikh Mohammed has a vast horse-racing enterprise and frequently attends major events such as Royal Ascot, where he has been pictured with Queen Elizabeth II. But he has faced severe criticism over the treatment of Princess Latifa and her stepmother, Princess Haya Bint Al Hussain, who fled to London in 2019 with her two children. ""There are no charges. It's pure punishment,"" Matthew Hedges,the British academic jailed for spying in the UAE in 2018, told the BBC when asked about the Princess Latifa case. ""There's no one looking out for her. It brings [my experiences] back quite dramatically,"" he added. Princess Latifa's videos were obtained by BBC Panorama, which has independently verified the details of where she was held. Watch the Missing Princess on BBC iPlayer The videos were recorded over several months on a phone she was secretly given about a year after her capture and return to Dubai. She recorded them in a bathroom as it had the only door she could lock. In the messages, she detailed how: she fought back against the soldiers taking her off the boat, ""kicking and fighting"" and biting one Emirati commando's arm until he screamed after being tranquillised she lost consciousness as she was being carried on to a private jet, and didn't wake up until it landed in Dubai she was being held alone without access to medical or legal help in a villa with windows and doors barred shut, and guarded by police Princess Latifa's account of her capture and detention was revealed by her close friend Tiina Jauhiainen, maternal cousin Marcus Essabri and campaigner David Haigh, who are all behind the Free Latifa campaign.

"Ford to go all-electric in Europe by 2030By the middle of 2026, all its cars will be available as electric or hybrid models, it said.","A Ford Explorer hybrid SUV Carmaker Ford has said its passenger vehicle line-up in Europe will be all-electric by 2030. By the middle of 2026, all its cars will be available as electric or hybrid models, it added. It joins a growing list of car brands cutting petrol and diesel production, including Jaguar and Bentley. European regulators are clamping down on emissions, with countries including UK planning to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel motors. Ford said it would spend $1bn (Â£720m) updating its factory in Cologne, with the aim of producing a mass-market electric vehicle by 2023. Jaguar car brand to be all-electric by 2025 Electric car battery plant plan for airport ""Our announcement today to transform our Cologne facility, the home of our operations in Germany for 90 years, is one of the most significant Ford has made in over a generation,"" said Stuart Rowley, president of Ford in Europe. ""It underlines our commitment to Europe and a modern future with electric vehicles at the heart of our strategy for growth."" Ford is the largest carmaker to make such an announcement in Europe, holding a 15% share of the regional market. On Monday, Jaguar Land Rover said its cars would be all-electric by 2030, with its Jaguar brand electrified by 2025. GM and Volvo Cars have set similarly ambitious targets. This year car makers in the EU will face hefty fines if they fail to meet emissions standards. The UK meanwhile has said it plans to ban the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030, with France is targeting the same by 2040. David Leggett, automotive analyst at GlobalData, said: ""Automotive electrification is an expensive proposition for vehicle manufacturers, but they are nevertheless concluding that they must take the investment hit to be well-positioned competitively later this decade when the end for new internal combustion engine vehicle sales will be in sight in a number of markets."" On Tuesday it emerged that Coventry Airportcould be the site for a gigafactory- a plant to manufacture electric car batteries. The UK government previously announced Â£500m funding as part of a ten point plan to support the electrification of vehicles, including developing gigafactories across the UK.

Deaths mount as US storm causes major power cutsAt least 21 people have died while many more are struggling with power cuts and frigid conditions.US & Canada,"This video can not be played Frozen turbines and climate change: The politics behind the Texas power failure A huge winter storm sweeping across the southern US has killed at least 21 people and left millions without power. There have been widespread blackouts in Texas, where the energy grid was overwhelmed by a surge in demand. Millions of people in the state, which rarely experiences such low temperatures, have been struggling to cope with the lack of power and frigid conditions. The extreme weather is forecast to continue until the weekend. Deaths attributed to the storm have been recorded in Texas, Louisiana, Kentucky, North Carolina and Missouri. How to stay safe in freezing weather Are frozen wind turbines to blame? In pictures: Snow blankets Texas Why is Texas seeing Arctic temperatures? How long will the storm last? By Wednesday afternoon, the National Weather Service (NWS) said that the worst of the storm had moved through Texas, but kept more than 100 million Americans under a winter weather warning. But historically low temperatures are expected to remain for days, the NWS said, with more than 71% of the US covered by snow. This video can not be played Winter storm leaves millions of Texas residents without electricity The freezing storm has even reached northern and central parts of Mexico, where millions of people have experienced days of intermittent power cuts. ""I'm in Houston, Texas freezing to death,"" one Twitter user, Chris Prince, wrote. ""No power, no heat, no water. I have four young children. How is this happening right now?"" Another user, Josh Morgerman, wrote that a friend in Texas had resorted to ""burning furniture in the fireplace"" to stay warm. Texas family 'trying to keep warm' A senior director for Ercot - the Electric Reliability Council of Texas - told CNN on Wednesday that Texans could continue to experience rotating power outages into Thursday. Rotating outages are the ""best case"" scenario, Dan Woodfin said. ""I don't think it's likely that we're going to have enough available based on our forecasts... and that we're going to have everybody back on today, or before at least the morning peak tomorrow"". Scientists have linked climate change to an increasing number of severe weather events worldwide, including hurricanes, heat waves and floods. The recorded deaths include people who have died in traffic accidents, as well as some who suffered carbon monoxide poisoning from running cars and generators indoors to stay warm. ""This is an absolute public health disaster,"" one medical official in Houston told the local television station KPRC-TV. ""[Carbon monoxide poisoning] certainly happens when it gets cold, but never in these numbers. Queues have formed at shops in Texas where many are unused to freezing temperatures One county said it had seen more than 300 suspected carbon monoxide cases during the cold snap. ""It's turning into a mini mass casualty event,"" one Harris County doctor told the Houston Chronicle. At least four people were killed following a house fire in Houston that officials said may have been sparked by candles. Separately, police said two men found alongside a Houston highway were believed to have died due to the cold. Meanwhile in North Carolina, a tornado spawned by the same storm left three people dead and 10 injured. The cold snap has also forced Covid-19 vaccination centres to close for several days and hindered deliveries of doses in a handful of US states. Some centres raced to use vaccines that could no longer be refrigerated at the required temperature. The state has seen some of its coldest temperatures in more than 30 years - some areas hit 0F (-18C) on Sunday - and US President Joe Biden earlier approved a state of emergency. Many hotels in Texas are full with people who have no electricity at home Some two million people in Texas are still without power. At a press conference on Wednesday afternoon, Governor Greg Abbott said that 1.2 million Texans have so far had their power restored, with more coming ""on board"". The governor signed an executive order preventing any Texas natural gas from being exported outside of the state until 21 February. Mr Abbott also told reporters that every source of power in Texas had been ""compromised"" - seemingly walking back earlier comments blaming renewable energy for the state's blackouts. The scale of the power outage has prompted anger from some officials and residents. Mr Abbott has called the situation ""unacceptable"". He called for an investigation into the Electric Reliability Council of Texas (Ercot), an energy co-operative responsible for the vast majority of the state's electricity to get to the ""root of any missteps"" that led to the widespread outages. He has told local media that the body should be reformed and its leaders should resign. ""This was a total failure,"" he told ABC News. ""They showed that they were not reliable."" In a tweet on Tuesday, Ercot said it was ""restoring load as fast as we can in a stable manner"". The snow and ice triggered a flurry of traffic accidents - such as this one in Pierce, Texas Homes in the state are not normally insulated for cold weather, meaning that indoor temperatures in homes quickly dropped to freezing after heat systems failed. Frozen pipes also burst, despite attempts by some homeowners to insulate them from the cold using blankets. Chuck Hairston, who lives in a suburb of Fort Worth, had been without electricity for about 31 hours when he spoke to the BBC on Tuesday. Neighbourhoods like this one in Pflugerville faced many hours without electricity He said his family had slept beside the fireplace covered in ""every blanket and pillow we could find in the house"". He tried local hotels, but they were either fully booked or did not have electricity. Icy roads have also led to a spate of traffic accidents and people have been advised to avoid travel where possible. How are you coping with the freezing conditions where you are?

'My traumatic four year wait for justice',"Four years to wait for her day in court: Jenny's story sounds extreme - but not exceptional The backlog in the Crown Courts has hit a record of 56,000 cases - meaning some cases are now being timetabled for 2023. The Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary Robert Buckland - the cabinet minister in charge of the courts - is promising that a recovery plan will bring justice. But will those plans make a difference to victims waiting for their voices to be heard? If you want to know what it feels like to wait for justice for a serious crime, consider the limbo that ""Jenny"" finds herself in. For legal reasons, the BBC is not revealing any details of the case but, put briefly, she quietly and secretly coped for years with having been the victim of serious sexual violence. When the #MeToo movement took hold, she decided that she too had to speak out. In 2018 detectives video-recorded Jenny's allegations and, after a long and complex investigation, the Crown Prosecution Service concluded last summer that her abuser should be charged with serious offences. Jenny agreed not to begin deep trauma therapy because it may affect her evidence in court. Last autumn, she learned when her abuser would face trial - and she was devastated. Weeping, she recalled her conversation with the police officer. ""The first court hearing and second court hearing were really close to each other. And so that gave me some faith, I thought it's taken this long to get to this point. But actually, maybe this next bit isn't going to be as long. ""I was asked... to provide dates of availability for court for the next nine months. So I thought, it's just another nine months. I can do this. And then I got the call - and they gave me the date. It was 2022. ""I said down the phone, 'You do mean 2021?' And they said, 'No, we mean, 2022.' And I got really angry. How can anyone believe that that is acceptable that you keep somebody in trauma and you don't give them the access [to the therapy] that they need?"" Every week since has been a rollercoaster - to the point that Jenny cannot currently work and her family are rallying around to support her as she tries to comprehend the absence of justice. ""I start having a panic attack in the middle of town, I can't breathe. My body goes tight. I start convulsing, I'm sometimes sick, I'm shaking, I'm wailing. Trying to understand, why is that happening? ""There have been two occasions where I felt suicidal. The second time was when I was told the trial would be 2022. ""I felt like I'd been let down by the state. This was the whole system letting me down."" Jenny 's experience sounds extreme - but it is not exceptional, because of the enormous delays in criminal justice. Last month the watchdogs that report on the police, prosecution, prisons and probation all agreed that the backlog in Crown Courts of 54,000 caseswas of grave concern. In the last week, it's hit an all-time record of 56,000. There was a backlog in the Crown Courts before the pandemic hit. Coronavirus made operations far harder because many courtrooms are too small to safely distance everyone who needs to be inside. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Buckland has defended the government's attempts to tackle these record backlogs. He has promised that his court recovery plan will work - but it will take time. Today, he's announcing 14 more temporary ""Nightingale Courts"" - converted spaces and hotel conference facilities that are part of Â£113m of spending to alleviate the pressure. Part of Manchester Crown Court will be knocked through to create a new ""super court"" for large socially-distanced gang trials. About 20,000 monthly remote video hearings - not without some technical problems - are already part of the court process. ""I think we're virtually at the limit of what we think is feasible, we continue to look to see what more can be done,"" he says. ""But I think the key now is, it's not just about capacity, it's about getting cases listed. Working with [judges], I think that we can make solid progress this year."" A court sketch from a major trial at the Old Bailey shows some of the measures that have been put in place to allow justice to continue The Criminal Bar Association says new spaces are not enough - they need to be staffed. In 2009-10, the budget for Crown Courts in England and Wales meant judges could ""sit"" for more than 108,000 days. Last year, it was 86,000. That roughly equates to only 45% of available court space being used, before the pandemic hit. Mr Buckland says reductions in ""sitting days"" were driven by projections of falling levels of crime. His critics say it was also a political decision to deliver cuts. He is now promising a huge increase in sitting days - above 100,000 - in effect a return to where the courts were. ""I'm working out the number of days to be agreed with the Lord Chief Justice,"" he says. ""But I can assure everybody that that number [of sitting days] will be significantly in advance of 82,000 to many, many tens of thousands of days above that."" This video can not be played WATCH: Two young lawyers share their concerns about the profession It's worth noting that before he became a minister, Mr Buckland sat as a part-time Crown Court judge. So what does he say to victims like Jenny who are in limbo? ""That case is a dramatic example of a number of cases that concern me. I don't want to see victims and witnesses having to wait an inordinate length of time. I can understand her perspective. ""I accept what you say about the huge frustrations and the anxiety and the concern that is out there. But I'm doing everything I can to mitigate those problems."" One of the most significant changes has been the extension of the option of pre-trial video-recorded testimony and cross-examination for vulnerable victims and witnesses - in essence allowing them to give evidence long before a court hears the case. The government has also pledgedan extra Â£40m to support vulnerable people,externalwaiting for trial - including Â£16m for more independent sexual violence advisers - specialists who have been instrumental in supporting Jenny as she waits for justice. Jenny meanwhile has been given permission by prosecutors to get additional help - but she can't get the specific deep counselling that could help her because the waiting list in her part of the country is staggeringly long. ""I'm resilient. I've got support. What about individuals who have got no family, no friends?"" she says. ""How many of those have walked away? Not because a crime didn't happen, but because the system hasn't enabled their voice to come out? ""The system is not broken because of Covid. It was well broken before that. And you might put your Nightingale courts up and running, but you need to go back to asking: what do the victims need?""

They were brought to you by Alice Evans, Becky Morton, James Clarke, Jennifer Meierhans, Katie Wright and Sophie Williams. Boris Johnson visited a vaccination centre in Cwmbran, south Wales We are going to be bringing the live page to a close soon, so here's a recap of the day's coronavirus news: A family have harnessed the power of the imagination to ""go on holiday"" at home during England's lockdown. The Hodgsons packed their bags and embarked on a two-day trip to tropical ""Hodgeland"", complete with an airport departure lounge and a plane journey. The Disney-mad family from Leeds say it lifted their spirits during the ""toughest"" lockdown yet. The plan was conjured up by Heather Hodgson, who kept husband Dom and four-year-old Scarlett in the dark about the itinerary. Mr Hodgson says: ""The little details really made it, she built a website to check in our passports for our flight, pre-recorded airport announcements and put tropical air fresheners around the room."" Have a look at the holiday snapshere. Police in Greater Manchester have dealt with 1,200 Covid-related incidents in a week after a ""resurgence"" in parties and large gatherings, officials say. They have also seen greater ""resistance"" to police enforcement, officials for the Greater Manchester Combined Authority say. Speaking at a weekly press conference Bev Hughes, deputy mayor for policing and crime, said 280 fixed penalty notices had been issued in the past week, including 55 fines of Â£800, of which 32 were handed out at a mass gathering in Salford. Police also released footage of a large party at Beetham Tower on Deansgate which ended up in ""a fight with about 50 people, and the owner is being pursued there for the Â£10,000 fine,"" she says. Several gyms, backroom bars and pubs, and a large yoga gathering were also found to be operating in the region. Olivia Hall gave birth at the start of the pandemic. She was one of the first cases to be placed in isolation at Southmead Hospital in Bristol. Her son, Harrison Ahyow, is now a toddler and she says it ""saddens"" her that no-one was able to see him as a baby. She says she has flashbacks to his birth on 25 March during the first lockdown. ""I'd been left for hours labouring in the hospital car park,"" she says. ""They didn't know where to put me, having shown symptoms for coronavirus 10 days previously. ""They weren't testing then so I went into hospital alone, and 24 hours later I went into surgery alone. ""An emergency C-section was required to deliver my first child. We're 10-and-a-half months later and I've seen a health visitor once."" Read Olivia's take on motherhood and lockdown life in her own words. Scottish crime author Ian Rankinsays his son Kit has been ""forgotten""as vaccines were delivered to care homes. The 26-year-old - who has severe learning difficulties - lives in care in Edinburgh, but did not qualify in the first priority group. The Scottish government said it had ""rightly"" prioritised those at higher mortality risk. People with a ""severe or profound"" learning disabilityare in priority group six for the coronavirus vaccine,external. Rankin told the BBC: ""Our son can't look after himself and he's in the same group as us - his parents, who are healthy 65-year-olds. People with learning difficulties should have been prioritised. ""It's a bit late now. My son will get the jab in the next month or so. But we should learn lessons for the future about what it seems to be a bit of a lottery."" More than Â£500,000 has been raised to help a mountain rescue volunteer who suffered life-changing injuries going to the aid of campers who had broken coronavirus lockdown restrictions. Chris Lewis, a member of the Patterdale Mountain Rescue Team in the Lake District, suffered severe spinal injuries when he fell 500ft (150m). Lewis, 60, also suffered multiple facial fractures in the fall at Red Screes, above Kirkstone Pass on 6 February. Colleagues described the fundraising support,which saw more than 20,000 people donate in less than 48 hours,as ""phenomenal"". The campers, from Liverpool and Leicester,have both been fined Â£200. An investigation was launched last March after numerous complaints about the lack of precautions for workers in New York Internet giant Amazon is being sued by New York over its
coronavirus response. In a lawsuit, Attorney General General

domestically-transmitted cases of Covid-19. This has pretty much been the story for the last week, and Chinese
media have been praising these statistics, and thanking groups of people that
the government urged shouldnât travel during the Spring Festival holiday

overseas Chinese. In January, there were multiple outbreaks of the virus in the
northeast of the country. And as hundreds of thousands of people traditionally travel across
China for the Lunar New Year â which this year fell on 12 February - to spend
time with their families, there were government concerns this annual
migration might exacerbate the spread of the coronavirus. Consequently, Chinaâs central government tried to
discourage people from travelling this year, and local governmentsintroduced financial incentives for people to stay put. The government also introduced special measures
for those who did still intend to travel, in order to keep them safe. Travellers were instructed to show a negative Covid-19 test within seven
days of their journey, and encouraged toself-isolate for 14 days on arrival at their destination. Tens of millions of people will still be travelling daily between
now and the beginning of March, but today is the last public holiday in China,

"'My traumatic four year wait for justice'The backlog in the Crown Courts has hit an all-time high, but will plans to reduce it make a difference to victims waiting for their voices to be heard?UK","Four years to wait for her day in court: Jenny's story sounds extreme - but not exceptional The backlog in the Crown Courts has hit a record of 56,000 cases - meaning some cases are now being timetabled for 2023. The Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary Robert Buckland - the cabinet minister in charge of the courts - is promising that a recovery plan will bring justice. But will those plans make a difference to victims waiting for their voices to be heard? If you want to know what it feels like to wait for justice for a serious crime, consider the limbo that ""Jenny"" finds herself in. For legal reasons, the BBC is not revealing any details of the case but, put briefly, she quietly and secretly coped for years with having been the victim of serious sexual violence. When the #MeToo movement took hold, she decided that she too had to speak out. In 2018 detectives video-recorded Jenny's allegations and, after a long and complex investigation, the Crown Prosecution Service concluded last summer that her abuser should be charged with serious offences. Jenny agreed not to begin deep trauma therapy because it may affect her evidence in court. Last autumn, she learned when her abuser would face trial - and she was devastated. Weeping, she recalled her conversation with the police officer. ""The first court hearing and second court hearing were really close to each other. And so that gave me some faith, I thought it's taken this long to get to this point. But actually, maybe this next bit isn't going to be as long. ""I was asked... to provide dates of availability for court for the next nine months. So I thought, it's just another nine months. I can do this. And then I got the call - and they gave me the date. It was 2022. ""I said down the phone, 'You do mean 2021?' And they said, 'No, we mean, 2022.' And I got really angry. How can anyone believe that that is acceptable that you keep somebody in trauma and you don't give them the access [to the therapy] that they need?"" Every week since has been a rollercoaster - to the point that Jenny cannot currently work and her family are rallying around to support her as she tries to comprehend the absence of justice. ""I start having a panic attack in the middle of town, I can't breathe. My body goes tight. I start convulsing, I'm sometimes sick, I'm shaking, I'm wailing. Trying to understand, why is that happening? ""There have been two occasions where I felt suicidal. The second time was when I was told the trial would be 2022. ""I felt like I'd been let down by the state. This was the whole system letting me down."" Jenny 's experience sounds extreme - but it is not exceptional, because of the enormous delays in criminal justice. Last month the watchdogs that report on the police, prosecution, prisons and probation all agreed that the backlog in Crown Courts of 54,000 caseswas of grave concern. In the last week, it's hit an all-time record of 56,000. There was a backlog in the Crown Courts before the pandemic hit. Coronavirus made operations far harder because many courtrooms are too small to safely distance everyone who needs to be inside. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Buckland has defended the government's attempts to tackle these record backlogs. He has promised that his court recovery plan will work - but it will take time. Today, he's announcing 14 more temporary ""Nightingale Courts"" - converted spaces and hotel conference facilities that are part of Â£113m of spending to alleviate the pressure. Part of Manchester Crown Court will be knocked through to create a new ""super court"" for large socially-distanced gang trials. About 20,000 monthly remote video hearings - not without some technical problems - are already part of the court process. ""I think we're virtually at the limit of what we think is feasible, we continue to look to see what more can be done,"" he says. ""But I think the key now is, it's not just about capacity, it's about getting cases listed. Working with [judges], I think that we can make solid progress this year."" A court sketch from a major trial at the Old Bailey shows some of the measures that have been put in place to allow justice to continue The Criminal Bar Association says new spaces are not enough - they need to be staffed. In 2009-10, the budget for Crown Courts in England and Wales meant judges could ""sit"" for more than 108,000 days. Last year, it was 86,000. That roughly equates to only 45% of available court space being used, before the pandemic hit. Mr Buckland says reductions in ""sitting days"" were driven by projections of falling levels of crime. His critics say it was also a political decision to deliver cuts. He is now promising a huge increase in sitting days - above 100,000 - in effect a return to where the courts were. ""I'm working out the number of days to be agreed with the Lord Chief Justice,"" he says. ""But I can assure everybody that that number [of sitting days] will be significantly in advance of 82,000 to many, many tens of thousands of days above that."" This video can not be played WATCH: Two young lawyers share their concerns about the profession It's worth noting that before he became a minister, Mr Buckland sat as a part-time Crown Court judge. So what does he say to victims like Jenny who are in limbo? ""That case is a dramatic example of a number of cases that concern me. I don't want to see victims and witnesses having to wait an inordinate length of time. I can understand her perspective. ""I accept what you say about the huge frustrations and the anxiety and the concern that is out there. But I'm doing everything I can to mitigate those problems."" One of the most significant changes has been the extension of the option of pre-trial video-recorded testimony and cross-examination for vulnerable victims and witnesses - in essence allowing them to give evidence long before a court hears the case. The government has also pledgedan extra Â£40m to support vulnerable people,externalwaiting for trial - including Â£16m for more independent sexual violence advisers - specialists who have been instrumental in supporting Jenny as she waits for justice. Jenny meanwhile has been given permission by prosecutors to get additional help - but she can't get the specific deep counselling that could help her because the waiting list in her part of the country is staggeringly long. ""I'm resilient. I've got support. What about individuals who have got no family, no friends?"" she says. ""How many of those have walked away? Not because a crime didn't happen, but because the system hasn't enabled their voice to come out? ""The system is not broken because of Covid. It was well broken before that. And you might put your Nightingale courts up and running, but you need to go back to asking: what do the victims need?""

LiveLiveCovid restrictions to be lifted in stages - Johnson3 minutes ago,"The easing of England's lockdown will be based on a ""cautious and prudent approach"", Prime Minister Boris Johnson says England is still âsome way awayâ from being able to start relaxing lockdown restrictions, the chief executive of NHS Providers says A further 738 deaths have been reported in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test There have also been another 12,718 daily UK cases, while 15,940,972 people have received the first dose of a vaccine The UK will expose a group of healthy volunteers aged 18-30 to Covid-19 in a bid to establish which vaccines and treatments work best Fatigue, headache, sore throat and diarrhoea should be added to the symptoms which trigger a Covid test, researchers suggest The EU has bought up to 300 million Moderna vaccine doses, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen confirms Edited by Katie Wright Thank you for joining us for live updates on the coronavirus pandemic. They were brought to you by Alice Evans, Becky Morton, James Clarke, Jennifer Meierhans, Katie Wright and Sophie Williams. Boris Johnson visited a vaccination centre in Cwmbran, south Wales We are going to be bringing the live page to a close soon, so here's a recap of the day's coronavirus news: A family have harnessed the power of the imagination to ""go on holiday"" at home during England's lockdown. The Hodgsons packed their bags and embarked on a two-day trip to tropical ""Hodgeland"", complete with an airport departure lounge and a plane journey. The Disney-mad family from Leeds say it lifted their spirits during the ""toughest"" lockdown yet. The plan was conjured up by Heather Hodgson, who kept husband Dom and four-year-old Scarlett in the dark about the itinerary. Mr Hodgson says: ""The little details really made it, she built a website to check in our passports for our flight, pre-recorded airport announcements and put tropical air fresheners around the room."" Have a look at the holiday snapshere. Police in Greater Manchester have dealt with 1,200 Covid-related incidents in a week after a ""resurgence"" in parties and large gatherings, officials say. They have also seen greater ""resistance"" to police enforcement, officials for the Greater Manchester Combined Authority say. Speaking at a weekly press conference Bev Hughes, deputy mayor for policing and crime, said 280 fixed penalty notices had been issued in the past week, including 55 fines of Â£800, of which 32 were handed out at a mass gathering in Salford. Police also released footage of a large party at Beetham Tower on Deansgate which ended up in ""a fight with about 50 people, and the owner is being pursued there for the Â£10,000 fine,"" she says. Several gyms, backroom bars and pubs, and a large yoga gathering were also found to be operating in the region. Olivia Hall gave birth at the start of the pandemic. She was one of the first cases to be placed in isolation at Southmead Hospital in Bristol. Her son, Harrison Ahyow, is now a toddler and she says it ""saddens"" her that no-one was able to see him as a baby. She says she has flashbacks to his birth on 25 March during the first lockdown. ""I'd been left for hours labouring in the hospital car park,"" she says. ""They didn't know where to put me, having shown symptoms for coronavirus 10 days previously. ""They weren't testing then so I went into hospital alone, and 24 hours later I went into surgery alone. ""An emergency C-section was required to deliver my first child. We're 10-and-a-half months later and I've seen a health visitor once."" Read Olivia's take on motherhood and lockdown life in her own words. Scottish crime author Ian Rankinsays his son Kit has been ""forgotten""as vaccines were delivered to care homes. The 26-year-old - who has severe learning difficulties - lives in care in Edinburgh, but did not qualify in the first priority group. The Scottish government said it had ""rightly"" prioritised those at higher mortality risk. People with a ""severe or profound"" learning disabilityare in priority group six for the coronavirus vaccine,external. Rankin told the BBC: ""Our son can't look after himself and he's in the same group as us - his parents, who are healthy 65-year-olds. People with learning difficulties should have been prioritised. ""It's a bit late now. My son will get the jab in the next month or so. But we should learn lessons for the future about what it seems to be a bit of a lottery."" More than Â£500,000 has been raised to help a mountain rescue volunteer who suffered life-changing injuries going to the aid of campers who had broken coronavirus lockdown restrictions. Chris Lewis, a member of the Patterdale Mountain Rescue Team in the Lake District, suffered severe spinal injuries when he fell 500ft (150m). Lewis, 60, also suffered multiple facial fractures in the fall at Red Screes, above Kirkstone Pass on 6 February. Colleagues described the fundraising support,which saw more than 20,000 people donate in less than 48 hours,as ""phenomenal"". The campers, from Liverpool and Leicester,have both been fined Â£200. An investigation was launched last March after numerous complaints about the lack of precautions for workers in New York Internet giant Amazon is being sued by New York over its
coronavirus response. In a lawsuit, Attorney General General
Letitia James said her inquiry into conditions at two warehouses in New York
City found Amazon implemented a âdeficientâ programme to trace the

"LiveLiveCovid restrictions to be lifted in stages - JohnsonThe easing of England's lockdown will be based on a ""cautious and prudent approach"", the PM saysUK","The easing of England's lockdown will be based on a ""cautious and prudent approach"", Prime Minister Boris Johnson says England is still âsome way awayâ from being able to start relaxing lockdown restrictions, the chief executive of NHS Providers says A further 738 deaths have been reported in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test There have also been another 12,718 daily UK cases, while 15,940,972 people have received the first dose of a vaccine The UK will expose a group of healthy volunteers aged 18-30 to Covid-19 in a bid to establish which vaccines and treatments work best Fatigue, headache, sore throat and diarrhoea should be added to the symptoms which trigger a Covid test, researchers suggest The EU has bought up to 300 million Moderna vaccine doses, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen confirms Edited by Katie Wright Thank you for joining us for live updates on the coronavirus pandemic. They were brought to you by Alice Evans, Becky Morton, James Clarke, Jennifer Meierhans, Katie Wright and Sophie Williams. Boris Johnson visited a vaccination centre in Cwmbran, south Wales We are going to be bringing the live page to a close soon, so here's a recap of the day's coronavirus news: A family have harnessed the power of the imagination to ""go on holiday"" at home during England's lockdown. The Hodgsons packed their bags and embarked on a two-day trip to tropical ""Hodgeland"", complete with an airport departure lounge and a plane journey. The Disney-mad family from Leeds say it lifted their spirits during the ""toughest"" lockdown yet. The plan was conjured up by Heather Hodgson, who kept husband Dom and four-year-old Scarlett in the dark about the itinerary. Mr Hodgson says: ""The little details really made it, she built a website to check in our passports for our flight, pre-recorded airport announcements and put tropical air fresheners around the room."" Have a look at the holiday snapshere. Police in Greater Manchester have dealt with 1,200 Covid-related incidents in a week after a ""resurgence"" in parties and large gatherings, officials say. They have also seen greater ""resistance"" to police enforcement, officials for the Greater Manchester Combined Authority say. Speaking at a weekly press conference Bev Hughes, deputy mayor for policing and crime, said 280 fixed penalty notices had been issued in the past week, including 55 fines of Â£800, of which 32 were handed out at a mass gathering in Salford. Police also released footage of a large party at Beetham Tower on Deansgate which ended up in ""a fight with about 50 people, and the owner is being pursued there for the Â£10,000 fine,"" she says. Several gyms, backroom bars and pubs, and a large yoga gathering were also found to be operating in the region. Olivia Hall gave birth at the start of the pandemic. She was one of the first cases to be placed in isolation at Southmead Hospital in Bristol. Her son, Harrison Ahyow, is now a toddler and she says it ""saddens"" her that no-one was able to see him as a baby. She says she has flashbacks to his birth on 25 March during the first lockdown. ""I'd been left for hours labouring in the hospital car park,"" she says. ""They didn't know where to put me, having shown symptoms for coronavirus 10 days previously. ""They weren't testing then so I went into hospital alone, and 24 hours later I went into surgery alone. ""An emergency C-section was required to deliver my first child. We're 10-and-a-half months later and I've seen a health visitor once."" Read Olivia's take on motherhood and lockdown life in her own words. Scottish crime author Ian Rankinsays his son Kit has been ""forgotten""as vaccines were delivered to care homes. The 26-year-old - who has severe learning difficulties - lives in care in Edinburgh, but did not qualify in the first priority group. The Scottish government said it had ""rightly"" prioritised those at higher mortality risk. People with a ""severe or profound"" learning disabilityare in priority group six for the coronavirus vaccine,external. Rankin told the BBC: ""Our son can't look after himself and he's in the same group as us - his parents, who are healthy 65-year-olds. People with learning difficulties should have been prioritised. ""It's a bit late now. My son will get the jab in the next month or so. But we should learn lessons for the future about what it seems to be a bit of a lottery."" More than Â£500,000 has been raised to help a mountain rescue volunteer who suffered life-changing injuries going to the aid of campers who had broken coronavirus lockdown restrictions. Chris Lewis, a member of the Patterdale Mountain Rescue Team in the Lake District, suffered severe spinal injuries when he fell 500ft (150m). Lewis, 60, also suffered multiple facial fractures in the fall at Red Screes, above Kirkstone Pass on 6 February. Colleagues described the fundraising support,which saw more than 20,000 people donate in less than 48 hours,as ""phenomenal"". The campers, from Liverpool and Leicester,have both been fined Â£200. An investigation was launched last March after numerous complaints about the lack of precautions for workers in New York Internet giant Amazon is being sued by New York over its
coronavirus response. In a lawsuit, Attorney General General
Letitia James said her inquiry into conditions at two warehouses in New York
City found Amazon implemented a âdeficientâ programme to trace the
contacts of infected workers. She also claims the company did
not follow rules requiring companies to shut and disinfect areas that had been
visited by a sick person, among other violations. James launched her investigation last March after numerous complaints about the lack of precautions for workers in New York, then the epicentre of the US coronavirus outbreak. Amazon last week attempted to
block the lawsuit with its own legal action. It said James was applying ""an inconsistent and
unfair"" standard. Read more here Northern Ireland's vaccine rollout is running weeks ahead of schedule, Health Minister Robin Swann has said. Carers and more people with underlying health conditions were due to be vaccinated in March butthis will be brought forward ""on a staggered basis"",he says. ""As ever, the rate of our progress through the eligible groups will depend on available supplies of vaccines,"" he says. The vaccine rollout will be divided between GP practices and the seven regional vaccination centres. On Wednesday, the Department of Health recorded six more Covid-19 related deaths, taking its death toll to 2,015. Cathy KillickJournalist, BBC Look North I lost both of my parents to Covid within six weeks. I've been a reporter for the BBC for more than 30 years. In that time I've interviewed dozens of people who have experienced loss. I've done my best to convey their emotion faithfully, not having experienced it myself. Now I find I am one of those people. I've always been struck by the bravery of those I've talked to and I've always been grateful to them too. Journalism can only exist if people are willing to share their stories, so I'm going to share mine not because I'm brave, but because I owe them. I've made this video below and the full story ishere. This video can not be played All Premier League football matches willremain available to watch live in the UK until fans are allowed to return to stadiums. Matches will continue to be broadcast by Sky Sports, BT Sport, Amazon Prime Video and the BBC. Premier League football has been played behind closed doors since the 2019-20 season resumed in June following the first coronavirus lockdown. Some Premier League clubs were able to welcome up to 2,000 fans in December, but games were soon moved back behind closed doors amid rising cases of Covid-19. Earlier this month, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told BBC Sport there was a""long path ahead of us""before fans could return to stadiums. On Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to announce how the current lockdown in England will be eased. President Cyril Ramaphosa was amongst those vaccinated on the first day As we mentioned earlier, South
Africa has started Covid vaccinations following the suspension of an earlier
plan to use the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. A new variant accounts for most
of the new cases in South Africa. South Africa put the rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on hold, following a study thatshowed ""disappointing"" results against the country's new Covid-19 strain. South
Africa says it has so far secured enough doses for the target population of 40
million. However,
there has been criticism the government was too slow to act. Read more about immunisations and what the government is saying. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Volunteers will get coronavirus squirted up their noses As we've been reporting today, a group of UK volunteers aresoon to be deliberately infected with coronavirusin what's known as a ""challenge trial"". It will be the first such trial in Covid anywhere in the world. The volunteers will come into hospital and spend the whole time in a single room, and come into contact only with people running the trial. On the third day, a small syringe filled with live virus will be squirted up their nose. They will be monitored in hospital - including regular blood samples - for at least the following two weeks, after which they can go home if they are free of the virus. The volunteers will continue to be followed up for a year. Challenge trials and traditional trials are both important but there are some advantages to challenge trials, such as that they get results - including on vaccine effectiveness - incredibly quickly. This is because everyone is deliberately infected, whereas a ""real-world"" trial would have to wait for people to catch the virus in their day-to-day lives. The UK trial is focusing on young people (aged 18-30) with no health problems, who we know are very unlikely to have any health problems from a coronavirus infection, and they will be closely monitored in hospital. The risk is low, but a challenge trial is not completely risk-free. Read the full explainer here. Following the UK government's release of daily coronavirus statistics, here are some charts showing the country's epidemic. To track case numbers in your area and see more graphs and charts,read our full story. Labour's shadow health secretary says he expects the government to lift Covid restrictions in England through ""gradual easing"" rather than ending lockdown ""in one big snap"". Speaking to reporters, Jonathan Ashworth agrees withPrime Minister Boris Johnson's comments made earlier today- that any easing should be driven by data rather than dates. ""But we have to be cautious because this has got to be the final lockdown,"" Ashworth adds. He agrees the vaccination programme has been ""a success"" but says the government needs to ""do more"" to stop the spread of the virus when lockdown measures are eased. Ashworth lists sick pay as one of the elements that needs addressing and says ""double-masking"" -a concept being recommended in the US- should also be considered when UK ministers review the rules. The PM will set out details on Monday on the plan for lifting restrictions. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Tens of millions of people will still be travelling daily between now and the beginning of March In the past 24 hours, China has reported no new
domestically-transmitted cases of Covid-19. This has pretty much been the story for the last week, and Chinese
media have been praising these statistics, and thanking groups of people that
the government urged shouldnât travel during the Spring Festival holiday
period. In particular, they have praised university students, migrants and
overseas Chinese. In January, there were multiple outbreaks of the virus in the
northeast of the country. And as hundreds of thousands of people traditionally travel across
China for the Lunar New Year â which this year fell on 12 February - to spend
time with their families, there were government concerns this annual
migration might exacerbate the spread of the coronavirus. Consequently, Chinaâs central government tried to
discourage people from travelling this year, and local governmentsintroduced financial incentives for people to stay put. The government also introduced special measures
for those who did still intend to travel, in order to keep them safe. Travellers were instructed to show a negative Covid-19 test within seven
days of their journey, and encouraged toself-isolate for 14 days on arrival at their destination. Tens of millions of people will still be travelling daily between
now and the beginning of March, but today is the last public holiday in China,
so the majority of people made their return journeys today. Caroline DaviesBBC transport correspondent One of the hotel rooms being used to quarantine arrivals Quarantine hotels in the UK opened to their first guests on Monday, but some have expressed concerns about their safety, the cost and whether the system works. Everyone who has visited or transited through 33 countries on the UK's ""red list"" who arrive in England must stay 11 nights in a quarantine hotel - at a cost of Â£1,750 for a single person. Mohammed Mostafa travelled to London after visiting family in Bangladesh. While the country is not on the red list, Mr Mostafa transited through the UAE which is - and the new measures took him by surprise. ""It was absolutely shocking and I felt quite intimidated as well,"" Mostafa told AFP news. He is staying at the Holiday Inn hotel and described his room as ""like a prison"". Read more. Tracy Moore and her husband Jason lost hundreds of pounds when they were told to isolate Self-isolation is costing people who do not qualify for financial support hundreds of pounds in lost income. Most applications to Wales' Â£500 self-isolation grant scheme have been rejected. Under the existing system, applicants must stand to lose income by isolating, and be on at least one of a range of benefits. The Welsh government announced on Wednesday it was expanding the scheme to include people not on any benefits but with a personal income of less than Â£500 net per week or on basic statutory sick pay. Tracy Moore, from Flintshire, saw her household income fall about Â£700 last month, and told BBC Wales Live the way the support system worked was ""wrong"". Her husband and son work for a Tarmac company and shared their van with someone who tested positive the following day. They called 111 and were advised to isolate for 10 days - but when they tried to apply for financial help they were told they were not eligible as they had not formally been asked to isolate by Test, Trace, Protect.

The right to a free TV licence for the elderly ended last August for all except those in receipt of the pension credit benefit. More than 2.7 million households with someone over 75 have now bought a licence, with 750,000 more applying for a free one under the new system. However, the BBC said around one in seven have not yet made arrangements. A spokeswoman denied reports that the corporation was introducing an amnesty on prosecutions for those who do not sign up. ""There is no amnesty, nor have we announced any new policy,"" she said. ""We are simply giving more people time to safely set up their licences in light of the pandemic.""

"'My traumatic four year wait for justice'The backlog in the Crown Courts has hit an all-time high, but will plans to reduce it make a difference to victims waiting for their voices to be heard?","Four years to wait for her day in court: Jenny's story sounds extreme - but not exceptional The backlog in the Crown Courts has hit a record of 56,000 cases - meaning some cases are now being timetabled for 2023. The Lord Chancellor and Justice Secretary Robert Buckland - the cabinet minister in charge of the courts - is promising that a recovery plan will bring justice. But will those plans make a difference to victims waiting for their voices to be heard? If you want to know what it feels like to wait for justice for a serious crime, consider the limbo that ""Jenny"" finds herself in. For legal reasons, the BBC is not revealing any details of the case but, put briefly, she quietly and secretly coped for years with having been the victim of serious sexual violence. When the #MeToo movement took hold, she decided that she too had to speak out. In 2018 detectives video-recorded Jenny's allegations and, after a long and complex investigation, the Crown Prosecution Service concluded last summer that her abuser should be charged with serious offences. Jenny agreed not to begin deep trauma therapy because it may affect her evidence in court. Last autumn, she learned when her abuser would face trial - and she was devastated. Weeping, she recalled her conversation with the police officer. ""The first court hearing and second court hearing were really close to each other. And so that gave me some faith, I thought it's taken this long to get to this point. But actually, maybe this next bit isn't going to be as long. ""I was asked... to provide dates of availability for court for the next nine months. So I thought, it's just another nine months. I can do this. And then I got the call - and they gave me the date. It was 2022. ""I said down the phone, 'You do mean 2021?' And they said, 'No, we mean, 2022.' And I got really angry. How can anyone believe that that is acceptable that you keep somebody in trauma and you don't give them the access [to the therapy] that they need?"" Every week since has been a rollercoaster - to the point that Jenny cannot currently work and her family are rallying around to support her as she tries to comprehend the absence of justice. ""I start having a panic attack in the middle of town, I can't breathe. My body goes tight. I start convulsing, I'm sometimes sick, I'm shaking, I'm wailing. Trying to understand, why is that happening? ""There have been two occasions where I felt suicidal. The second time was when I was told the trial would be 2022. ""I felt like I'd been let down by the state. This was the whole system letting me down."" Jenny 's experience sounds extreme - but it is not exceptional, because of the enormous delays in criminal justice. Last month the watchdogs that report on the police, prosecution, prisons and probation all agreed that the backlog in Crown Courts of 54,000 caseswas of grave concern. In the last week, it's hit an all-time record of 56,000. There was a backlog in the Crown Courts before the pandemic hit. Coronavirus made operations far harder because many courtrooms are too small to safely distance everyone who needs to be inside. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Buckland has defended the government's attempts to tackle these record backlogs. He has promised that his court recovery plan will work - but it will take time. Today, he's announcing 14 more temporary ""Nightingale Courts"" - converted spaces and hotel conference facilities that are part of Â£113m of spending to alleviate the pressure. Part of Manchester Crown Court will be knocked through to create a new ""super court"" for large socially-distanced gang trials. About 20,000 monthly remote video hearings - not without some technical problems - are already part of the court process. ""I think we're virtually at the limit of what we think is feasible, we continue to look to see what more can be done,"" he says. ""But I think the key now is, it's not just about capacity, it's about getting cases listed. Working with [judges], I think that we can make solid progress this year."" A court sketch from a major trial at the Old Bailey shows some of the measures that have been put in place to allow justice to continue The Criminal Bar Association says new spaces are not enough - they need to be staffed. In 2009-10, the budget for Crown Courts in England and Wales meant judges could ""sit"" for more than 108,000 days. Last year, it was 86,000. That roughly equates to only 45% of available court space being used, before the pandemic hit. Mr Buckland says reductions in ""sitting days"" were driven by projections of falling levels of crime. His critics say it was also a political decision to deliver cuts. He is now promising a huge increase in sitting days - above 100,000 - in effect a return to where the courts were. ""I'm working out the number of days to be agreed with the Lord Chief Justice,"" he says. ""But I can assure everybody that that number [of sitting days] will be significantly in advance of 82,000 to many, many tens of thousands of days above that."" This video can not be played WATCH: Two young lawyers share their concerns about the profession It's worth noting that before he became a minister, Mr Buckland sat as a part-time Crown Court judge. So what does he say to victims like Jenny who are in limbo? ""That case is a dramatic example of a number of cases that concern me. I don't want to see victims and witnesses having to wait an inordinate length of time. I can understand her perspective. ""I accept what you say about the huge frustrations and the anxiety and the concern that is out there. But I'm doing everything I can to mitigate those problems."" One of the most significant changes has been the extension of the option of pre-trial video-recorded testimony and cross-examination for vulnerable victims and witnesses - in essence allowing them to give evidence long before a court hears the case. The government has also pledgedan extra Â£40m to support vulnerable people,externalwaiting for trial - including Â£16m for more independent sexual violence advisers - specialists who have been instrumental in supporting Jenny as she waits for justice. Jenny meanwhile has been given permission by prosecutors to get additional help - but she can't get the specific deep counselling that could help her because the waiting list in her part of the country is staggeringly long. ""I'm resilient. I've got support. What about individuals who have got no family, no friends?"" she says. ""How many of those have walked away? Not because a crime didn't happen, but because the system hasn't enabled their voice to come out? ""The system is not broken because of Covid. It was well broken before that.

'Spy pixels in emails have become endemic',"The use of ""invisible"" tracking tech in emails is now ""endemic"", according to a messaging service that analysed its traffic at the BBC's request. Hey's review indicated that two-thirds of emails sent to its users' personal accounts contained a ""spy pixel"", even after excluding for spam. Its makers said that many of the largest brands used email pixels, with the exception of the ""big tech"" firms. Defenders of the trackers say they are a commonplace marketing tactic. And several of the companies involved noted their use of such tech was mentioned within their wider privacy policies. Emails pixels can be used to log: if and when an email is opened how many times it is opened what device or devices are involved the user's rough physical location, deduced from their internet protocol (IP) address - in some cases making it possible to see the street the recipient is on This information can then be used to determine the impact of a specific email campaign, as well as to feed into more detailed customer profiles. Hey's co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson says they amount to a ""grotesque invasion of privacy"". Without special software, it is not easy to spot which emails contain a tracking pixel And other experts have also questioned whether companies are being as transparent as required under law about their use. Tracking pixels are typically a .GIF or .PNG file that is as small as 1x1 pixels, which is inserted into the header, footer or body of an email. Since they often show the colour of the content below, they can be impossible to spot with the naked eye even if you know where to look. Recipients do not need to click on a link or do anything to activate them beyond open an email they are embedded in. British Airways, TalkTalk, Vodafone, Sainsbury's, Tesco, HSBC, Marks & Spencer, Asos and Unilever are among UK brands Hey detected to be using them. But their use was much more widespread despite many members of the public being unaware of it, said Mr Hansson. ""It's not like there's a flag saying 'this email includes a spy pixel' in most email software,"" he added. Hey does offer such a facility, but users must pay an annual subscription. Hey alerts its customers to the use of pixel trackers and automatically blocks them Alternatively, users can install free plug-ins into other email programs to strip out many pixel trackers. Other options are to simply set their software to block all images by default, or to view emails as plain text. ""On average, every Hey customer receives 24 emails per day that attempt to spy on them,"" Mr Hansson said. ""The top 10% of users receive more than 50. ""We're processing over one million emails a day and we're just a tiny service compared to the likes of Gmail, but that's north of 600,000 spying attempts blocked every day."" The BBC also uses email pixels in some of its communications, although this was not picked up by Hey. Tracking pixels are a standard feature of automated email services used by large and small businesses, and in many cases the facility is difficult to turn off. Two years ago Superhuman, a consumer-focused email client, tried to extend their use to the public as a default feature of its own, butreversed course after a public outcry,external. That had little impact on the marketing industry's continued reliance on the tech. Clients can use them to track how many emails in a specific campaign are opened in aggregate, as well as to automatically stop sending messages to customers who ignore them. But a study by Princeton University also indicated the data gathered was sometimes linked to a users' cookies. This allows an individual's email address to be tied to their wider browsing habits, even as they move from one device to another. ""The resulting links between identities and web history profiles belie the claim of 'anonymous' web tracking,""the paper warned,external. In addition, trackers can also lead to personalised follow-ups. Danish technologist David Heinemeier Hansson co-created the premium email service Hey in 2020 ""Particularly with salespeople or consultants, they can go: 'I saw you open my email yesterday, but you haven't replied yet. Can I call?'"" said Mr Hansson. ""And in some cases they get outright belligerent when they see you've opened it three times but have still not replied."" Use of tracking pixels is governed in the UK and other parts of Europe by 2003'sPrivacy and Electronic Communications Regulations,external(Pecr) and 2016'sGeneral Data Protection Regulation,external(GDPR). They require organisations to inform recipients of the pixels, and in most cases to obtain consent. One privacy consultant saidthe Court of Justice of the European Union,external(CJEU) had previously ruled that such consent must be ""unambiguous"" and ""a clear affirmative act"". ""Solely placing something in a privacy notice is not consent, and it is hardly transparent,"" said Pat Walshe from Privacy Matters. ""The fact that tracking will take place and what that involves should be put in the user's face and involve them opting in. ""The law is clear enough, what we need is regulatory enforcement. Just because this practice is widespread doesn't mean it's correct and acceptable."" Mr Walshe noted that the ICO had used a pixel within its own e-newsletter. The ICO tells users their interactions with its newsletter will be tracked on the sign-up form The watchdog told the BBC it was used to track email openings, but not users' locations, adding: ""We're working with our provider to remove the pixel functionality and this should be completed soon."" The BBC asked some of the companies identified by Hey for their own response. British Airways said: ""We take customer data extremely seriously, and use a cross-industry standard approach that allows us to understand how effective our customer communications are."" TalkTalk said: ""As is common across our industry and others, we track the performance of different types of communications to understand what our customers prefer. We do not share this data externally.""

House prices rose 8.5% in 2020 amid pent-up demand,"UK house prices climbed 8.5% in 2020, the highest annual growth rate since October 2014, according to official figures. The average UK house price reached a record high of Â£252,000 in December 2020, the Office for National Statistics said. The North West had the highest growth of 11.2%, while London rose just 3.5%. The stamp duty holiday due to end this March contributed to the rise, the ONS said. Spending more time at home in the pandemic meant some people also decided they needed more space. That was reflected in the average price of detached properties climbing by twice as much as flats and maisonettes during 2020, up 10% and 5% respectively. Meanwhile Wales experienced the fastest price growth, with property values rising 10.7% to Â£184,000. In England, prices climbed 8.5% to Â£269,000, in Scotland, 8.4% to Â£163,000 and in Northern Ireland 5.3% to Â£148,000. ""Recent price increases may reflect a range of factors including pent-up demand, some possible changes in housing preferences since the pandemic and a response to the changes made to property transaction taxes across the nations,"" the ONS said. The UK housing market is made up of lots of local markets, with different factors affecting property prices such as the performance of schools and the availability of jobs. The ONS figures are based on sale completions. Although average London prices were up by 3.5%, over last year, prices fell in the capital by Â£5,000 between November and December, despite a UK-wide price increase of 1.2% over the month. But the city still has the highest average house price in the UK, at Â£496,000. The North East continued to have the lowest average house price at Â£141,000, and has become the final English region to surpass its pre-economic downturn peak of July 2007. ""2020 was the year that fundamentals came home to roost,"" said Nicky Stevenson, managing director at estate agent Fine & Country. ""There was no escaping a lack of space for households who suddenly found they were living on top of each other with little respite. That has powered annual growth that reached a six-year high."" There were four major drivers of overall house price rises in 2020, said Anna Clare Harper, chief executive of asset manager SPI Capital. ""The temporary stamp duty reduction and cheap debt as a result of very low interest rates, which give buyers a 'discount'; the release of pent-up supply and demand and desire to improve surroundings amongst existing homeowners; and the 'flight to safety', since in times of uncertainty, people want to keep their money in a stable asset with low volatility. ""But looking to the future when the temporary stamp duty reduction ends, we're likely to see a slowdown in house price rises,"" she said. ""However, there is still some life in the market as lockdown helps to concentrate many potential buyers and sellers' minds as far as moving is concerned,"" said north London estate agent Jeremy Leaf. ""Intense speculation remains as to whether the 31 March stamp duty deadline will be extended and we can't help but have sympathy for many who have started the process several months ago who have been unavoidably delayed by a backlog in searches, surveys, conveyancing, or all three, to say nothing of problems in the new-build industry.""

National Theatre shelves Europe tours after Brexit,"Luke Treadaway starred in the original production of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time The National Theatre has said uncertainty over obtaining visas and work permits in mainland Europe has led it to shelve plans to tour there. ""We are currently not able to confirm any touring commitments in Europe as a result of Brexit legislation,"" it said. UK actors, musicians and crews can't work freely across the continent following the departure from the EU. On Tuesday the government said it hopes to open negotiations with individual EU countries to help British artists tour. Culture minister Caroline Dinenage admitted there were ""a lot of obstacles to overcome"" after arts figures told a committee of MPs that Brexit had created an ""absolute crisis"". UK to appeal to EU countries over touring 'crisis' Music stars raise pressure over EU touring One of those figures, freelance lighting designer Paule Constable, said she had been told that the producers of War Horse would no longer tour the show in Europe. The National Theatre later clarified that it was in fact another of its acclaimed plays that had been affected. ""We had planned to take our production of The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, not War Horse, to venues in Europe as part of the now postponed 2020-21 tour,"" the theatre's spokeswoman told BBC News. She continued: ""The potential additional costs for visas and current lack of clarity around social security contributions as a result of the [Brexit] deal means regrettably it is currently not financially viable. ""We're awaiting further details of ongoing negotiations in this area and hope that in future we will be able to return to mainland Europe. ""However, due to the amount of time needed to plan a tour, we are not able to commit to European touring until we have clarity around these points."" The Curious Incident of the Dog in the Night-Time, which is based on Mark Haddon's 2003 novel, opened at the National in 2012. It won seven Olivier Awards and transferred to the West End before moving to Broadway and touring the world. Sir Ian McKellen and Sir Patrick Stewart signed an open letter on Tuesday The National's concerns echoed those voiced before the House of Commons culture select committee on Tuesday and by more than 100 members of the performers' Equity union in an open letter to the government. Sir Ian McKellen and Dame Julie Walters were among the signatories of the letter, which urged Prime Minister Boris Johnson to negotiate new terms with the EU that would allow ""creative practitioners"" like themselves ""to travel to the EU visa-free for work"". Deborah Annetts, chief executive of the Incorporated Society of Musicians, told MPs that some British musicians were having their summer concert plans cancelled, while others had been sacked from European orchestras. ""I have been inundated with personal testimony from musicians as to the work that they have lost or are going to lose now in Europe as a result of the new visa and work permit arrangements,"" she said. Liam Gallagher, Sir Elton John and Nicola Benedetti put their names to a previous open letter ""Some of them are really quite heart-rending, with musicians saying they are thinking of giving up being a musician altogether."" Constable, representing campaign group Freelancers Make Theatre Work, told the committee the current situation was ""absolute chaos"". Speaking on BBC Two's Newsnight on Tuesday, This Life and Doctors star Cyril Nri said he and his fellow actors had been ""left behind"" and were ""losing out on so much"". ""The hurdles in our way at this moment in time are huge,"" he said. ""We are going to lose a cultural exchange and the ability to bring in huge amounts of revenue to this country and to develop the actors of the future."" Nri claimed that actors with European passports were now being cast ahead of those without, suggesting UK passports had become ""a mill around our necks"". Musicians 'failed by government', stars say EU blames UK after outcry over musicians' touring Different EU countries have different arrangements for working musicians and other artists. Spain, for example, requires extra visas, while France does not. Speaking on Tuesday, committee chairman Julian Knight MP said the creative industries, a ""world-leading part of the UK economy"", had effectively ""had to endure a no-deal Brexit"". Ms Dinenage said striking deals on work permits and visas with individual countries that do require extra paperwork and fees was a ""more likely success route"" than attempting to reach an EU-wide agreement. Alastair Jones, a senior civil servant in the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport (DCMS), told the committee: ""Those conversations are happening within government now, and they will be happening with member states very shortly."" Responding to the National Theatre's statement on Wednesday, a government spokesperson said: ""Touring in Europe is currently not possible due to Covid-19 and EU member states have not set out plans for when it will be. We are working urgently with the UK's creative industries to help ensure they can work confidently in Europe once touring can safely resume.""

Food and furniture costs up despite Covid curbs,"Prices rose in January in what some economists warned could mark the first step towards increasing costs post-lockdown. Consumers paid more for food and sellers of household goods offered smaller-than-usual New Year discounts,official figures suggest,external. Inflation rose 0.7% in the 12 months to January, up from December's 0.6%. Some experts warned inflation will exceed the Bank of England's 2% target by the end of 2021. Inflation is the rate at which the prices for goods and services increase. As well as giving a snapshot of the price of our shopping and services, it influences interest rates and therefore our mortgages and is used to set regulated items, such as train tickets. It's one of the key measures of financial well-being, because it affects what consumers can buy for their money. If there is inflation, money doesn't go as far. A little inflation, however, typically encourages people to buy products sooner and makes it easier for companies to put up wages. And both of those things boost economic growth. Most countries' central banks have an inflation target of between 2% and 2.5%. Read more here. According to the Office for National Statistics (ONS), food prices rose by 0.6% in January, compared with a fall of 0.1% last time. Premium potato crisps and cauliflowers saw big increases after being discounted before Christmas. The price of fresh salmon and frozen prawns also rose. Jonathan Athow, deputy national statistician for economic statistics at the ONS, said household goods prices were also higher because there had been less discounting on items such as bedding or sofas. But Mr Athow pointed out that January discounting had continued for some goods, and there was a 4.6% fall in the cost of clothing and footwear. Experts said fashion is typically discounted in December and January for festive shoppers. Surprisingly, another large contributor to rising costs was restaurants and hotels. Prices in this category were estimated to have risen by 0.9% between December and January, largely driven by hotels. Holiday travel is not allowed under current lockdown rules, but hotels are open for people travelling for work and more recently people arriving from high risk countries who must quarantine. Some experts warned on Wednesday that inflation could exceed the Bank of England's 2% target by the end of 2021. ""January's small rise in CPI inflation marks the first step this year towards an above-target rate by the autumn,"" Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Economics said. As cuts in VAT for hospitality and tourism end at the end of March and energy prices rise, ""that alone should push prices up and we expect it to be up at around 2% at the end of the year, but it could be higher than that"", said Karen Ward, chief market strategist for Europe at JPMorgan Asset Management. She added that there could also be  an ""explosion in demand and perhaps not quite enough goods and services to fulfil that"" when lockdown restrictions are finally eased. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that this would mean the Bank of England's next change to interest rates - which are currently at 0.1% - would probably be upwards, though not for some time. But Ed Monk, associate director at Fidelity International, said that the picture overall was ""pretty confusing for prices right now"". ""It will take a few months and an ending of current restrictions for the full picture to emerge,"" he said. In the long-term, he said that prices will also depend on how the labour market fares once the government's furlough scheme has ended. ""Any increase in unemployment rates could suppress wage and price rises,"" he said. The UK's coronavirus vaccine rollout is also likely to push up inflation as the economy unlocks andconsumers may start spending roughly Â£125bn in pent-up savings,the Bank of England has previously suggested.

LiveLiveCalls to put young at heart of post-Covid rebuild4 minutes ago,"The easing of England's lockdown will be based on a ""cautious and prudent approach"", Prime Minister Boris Johnson says England is still âsome way awayâ from being able to start relaxing lockdown restrictions, the chief executive of NHS Providers says A further 738 deaths have been reported in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test There have also been another 12,718 daily UK cases, while 15,940,972 people have received the first dose of a vaccine The UK will expose a group of healthy volunteers aged 18-30 to Covid-19 in a bid to establish which vaccines and treatments work best Fatigue, headache, sore throat and diarrhoea should be added to the symptoms which trigger a Covid test, researchers suggest The EU has bought up to 300 million Moderna vaccine doses, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen confirms Edited by Katie Wright Thank you for joining us for live updates on the coronavirus pandemic. They were brought to you by Alice Evans, Becky Morton, James Clarke, Jennifer Meierhans, Katie Wright and Sophie Williams. Boris Johnson visited a vaccination centre in Cwmbran, south Wales We are going to be bringing the live page to a close soon, so here's a recap of the day's coronavirus news: A family have harnessed the power of the imagination to ""go on holiday"" at home during England's lockdown. The Hodgsons packed their bags and embarked on a two-day trip to tropical ""Hodgeland"", complete with an airport departure lounge and a plane journey. The Disney-mad family from Leeds say it lifted their spirits during the ""toughest"" lockdown yet. The plan was conjured up by Heather Hodgson, who kept husband Dom and four-year-old Scarlett in the dark about the itinerary. Mr Hodgson says: ""The little details really made it, she built a website to check in our passports for our flight, pre-recorded airport announcements and put tropical air fresheners around the room."" Have a look at the holiday snapshere. Police in Greater Manchester have dealt with 1,200 Covid-related incidents in a week after a ""resurgence"" in parties and large gatherings, officials say. They have also seen greater ""resistance"" to police enforcement, officials for the Greater Manchester Combined Authority say. Speaking at a weekly press conference Bev Hughes, deputy mayor for policing and crime, said 280 fixed penalty notices had been issued in the past week, including 55 fines of Â£800, of which 32 were handed out at a mass gathering in Salford. Police also released footage of a large party at Beetham Tower on Deansgate which ended up in ""a fight with about 50 people, and the owner is being pursued there for the Â£10,000 fine,"" she says. Several gyms, backroom bars and pubs, and a large yoga gathering were also found to be operating in the region. Olivia Hall gave birth at the start of the pandemic. She was one of the first cases to be placed in isolation at Southmead Hospital in Bristol. Her son, Harrison Ahyow, is now a toddler and she says it ""saddens"" her that no-one was able to see him as a baby. She says she has flashbacks to his birth on 25 March during the first lockdown. ""I'd been left for hours labouring in the hospital car park,"" she says. ""They didn't know where to put me, having shown symptoms for coronavirus 10 days previously. ""They weren't testing then so I went into hospital alone, and 24 hours later I went into surgery alone. ""An emergency C-section was required to deliver my first child. We're 10-and-a-half months later and I've seen a health visitor once."" Read Olivia's take on motherhood and lockdown life in her own words. Scottish crime author Ian Rankinsays his son Kit has been ""forgotten""as vaccines were delivered to care homes. The 26-year-old - who has severe learning difficulties - lives in care in Edinburgh, but did not qualify in the first priority group. The Scottish government said it had ""rightly"" prioritised those at higher mortality risk. People with a ""severe or profound"" learning disabilityare in priority group six for the coronavirus vaccine,external. Rankin told the BBC: ""Our son can't look after himself and he's in the same group as us - his parents, who are healthy 65-year-olds. People with learning difficulties should have been prioritised. ""It's a bit late now. My son will get the jab in the next month or so. But we should learn lessons for the future about what it seems to be a bit of a lottery."" More than Â£500,000 has been raised to help a mountain rescue volunteer who suffered life-changing injuries going to the aid of campers who had broken coronavirus lockdown restrictions. Chris Lewis, a member of the Patterdale Mountain Rescue Team in the Lake District, suffered severe spinal injuries when he fell 500ft (150m). Lewis, 60, also suffered multiple facial fractures in the fall at Red Screes, above Kirkstone Pass on 6 February. Colleagues described the fundraising support,which saw more than 20,000 people donate in less than 48 hours,as ""phenomenal"". The campers, from Liverpool and Leicester,have both been fined Â£200. An investigation was launched last March after numerous complaints about the lack of precautions for workers in New York Internet giant Amazon is being sued by New York over its
coronavirus response. In a lawsuit, Attorney General General
Letitia James said her inquiry into conditions at two warehouses in New York
City found Amazon implemented a âdeficientâ programme to trace the
contacts of infected workers. She also claims the company did
not follow rules requiring companies to shut and disinfect areas that had been
visited by a sick person, among other violations. James launched her investigation last March after numerous complaints about the lack of precautions for workers in New York, then the epicentre of the US coronavirus outbreak. Amazon last week attempted to
block the lawsuit with its own legal action. It said James was applying ""an inconsistent and
unfair"" standard. Read more here Northern Ireland's vaccine rollout is running weeks ahead of schedule, Health Minister Robin Swann has said. Carers and more people with underlying health conditions were due to be vaccinated in March butthis will be brought forward ""on a staggered basis"",he says. ""As ever, the rate of our progress through the eligible groups will depend on available supplies of vaccines,"" he says. The vaccine rollout will be divided between GP practices and the seven regional vaccination centres. On Wednesday, the Department of Health recorded six more Covid-19 related deaths, taking its death toll to 2,015. Cathy KillickJournalist, BBC Look North I lost both of my parents to Covid within six weeks. I've been a reporter for the BBC for more than 30 years. In that time I've interviewed dozens of people who have experienced loss. I've done my best to convey their emotion faithfully, not having experienced it myself. Now I find I am one of those people. I've always been struck by the bravery of those I've talked to and I've always been grateful to them too. Journalism can only exist if people are willing to share their stories, so I'm going to share mine not because I'm brave, but because I owe them. I've made this video below and the full story ishere. This video can not be played All Premier League football matches willremain available to watch live in the UK until fans are allowed to return to stadiums. Matches will continue to be broadcast by Sky Sports, BT Sport, Amazon Prime Video and the BBC. Premier League football has been played behind closed doors since the 2019-20 season resumed in June following the first coronavirus lockdown. Some Premier League clubs were able to welcome up to 2,000 fans in December, but games were soon moved back behind closed doors amid rising cases of Covid-19. Earlier this month, Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden told BBC Sport there was a""long path ahead of us""before fans could return to stadiums. On Monday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson is set to announce how the current lockdown in England will be eased. President Cyril Ramaphosa was amongst those vaccinated on the first day As we mentioned earlier, South
Africa has started Covid vaccinations following the suspension of an earlier
plan to use the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. A new variant accounts for most
of the new cases in South Africa. South Africa put the rollout of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine on hold, following a study thatshowed ""disappointing"" results against the country's new Covid-19 strain. South
Africa says it has so far secured enough doses for the target population of 40
million. However,
there has been criticism the government was too slow to act. Read more about immunisations and what the government is saying. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Volunteers will get coronavirus squirted up their noses As we've been reporting today, a group of UK volunteers aresoon to be deliberately infected with coronavirusin what's known as a ""challenge trial"". It will be the first such trial in Covid anywhere in the world. The volunteers will come into hospital and spend the whole time in a single room, and come into contact only with people running the trial. On the third day, a small syringe filled with live virus will be squirted up their nose. They will be monitored in hospital - including regular blood samples - for at least the following two weeks, after which they can go home if they are free of the virus. The volunteers will continue to be followed up for a year. Challenge trials and traditional trials are both important but there are some advantages to challenge trials, such as that they get results - including on vaccine effectiveness - incredibly quickly. This is because everyone is deliberately infected, whereas a ""real-world"" trial would have to wait for people to catch the virus in their day-to-day lives. The UK trial is focusing on young people (aged 18-30) with no health problems, who we know are very unlikely to have any health problems from a coronavirus infection, and they will be closely monitored in hospital. The risk is low, but a challenge trial is not completely risk-free. Read the full explainer here. Following the UK government's release of daily coronavirus statistics, here are some charts showing the country's epidemic. To track case numbers in your area and see more graphs and charts,read our full story. Labour's shadow health secretary says he expects the government to lift Covid restrictions in England through ""gradual easing"" rather than ending lockdown ""in one big snap"". Speaking to reporters, Jonathan Ashworth agrees withPrime Minister Boris Johnson's comments made earlier today- that any easing should be driven by data rather than dates. ""But we have to be cautious because this has got to be the final lockdown,"" Ashworth adds. He agrees the vaccination programme has been ""a success"" but says the government needs to ""do more"" to stop the spread of the virus when lockdown measures are eased. Ashworth lists sick pay as one of the elements that needs addressing and says ""double-masking"" -a concept being recommended in the US- should also be considered when UK ministers review the rules. The PM will set out details on Monday on the plan for lifting restrictions. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst Tens of millions of people will still be travelling daily between now and the beginning of March In the past 24 hours, China has reported no new
domestically-transmitted cases of Covid-19. This has pretty much been the story for the last week, and Chinese
media have been praising these statistics, and thanking groups of people that
the government urged shouldnât travel during the Spring Festival holiday
period. In particular, they have praised university students, migrants and
overseas Chinese. In January, there were multiple outbreaks of the virus in the
northeast of the country. And as hundreds of thousands of people traditionally travel across
China for the Lunar New Year â which this year fell on 12 February - to spend
time with their families, there were government concerns this annual
migration might exacerbate the spread of the coronavirus. Consequently, Chinaâs central government tried to
discourage people from travelling this year, and local governmentsintroduced financial incentives for people to stay put. The government also introduced special measures
for those who did still intend to travel, in order to keep them safe. Travellers were instructed to show a negative Covid-19 test within seven
days of their journey, and encouraged toself-isolate for 14 days on arrival at their destination. Tens of millions of people will still be travelling daily between
now and the beginning of March, but today is the last public holiday in China,
so the majority of people made their return journeys today. Caroline DaviesBBC transport correspondent One of the hotel rooms being used to quarantine arrivals Quarantine hotels in the UK opened to their first guests on Monday, but some have expressed concerns about their safety, the cost and whether the system works. Everyone who has visited or transited through 33 countries on the UK's ""red list"" who arrive in England must stay 11 nights in a quarantine hotel - at a cost of Â£1,750 for a single person. Mohammed Mostafa travelled to London after visiting family in Bangladesh. While the country is not on the red list, Mr Mostafa transited through the UAE which is - and the new measures took him by surprise. ""It was absolutely shocking and I felt quite intimidated as well,"" Mostafa told AFP news. He is staying at the Holiday Inn hotel and described his room as ""like a prison"". Read more. Tracy Moore and her husband Jason lost hundreds of pounds when they were told to isolate Self-isolation is costing people who do not qualify for financial support hundreds of pounds in lost income. Most applications to Wales' Â£500 self-isolation grant scheme have been rejected. Under the existing system, applicants must stand to lose income by isolating, and be on at least one of a range of benefits. The Welsh government announced on Wednesday it was expanding the scheme to include people not on any benefits but with a personal income of less than Â£500 net per week or on basic statutory sick pay. Tracy Moore, from Flintshire, saw her household income fall about Â£700 last month, and told BBC Wales Live the way the support system worked was ""wrong"". Her husband and son work for a Tarmac company and shared their van with someone who tested positive the following day. They called 111 and were advised to isolate for 10 days - but when they tried to apply for financial help they were told they were not eligible as they had not formally been asked to isolate by Test, Trace, Protect.

The right to a free TV licence for the elderly ended last August for all except those in receipt of the pension credit benefit. More than 2.7 million households with someone over 75 have now bought a licence, with 750,000 more applying for a free one under the new system. However, the BBC said around one in seven have not yet made arrangements. A spokeswoman denied reports that the corporation was introducing an amnesty on prosecutions for those who do not sign up. ""There is no amnesty, nor have we announced any new policy,"" she said. ""We are simply giving more people time to safely set up their licences in light of the pandemic.""

"Hospital waiting list 'may double to 10m by April'There could be a surge in demand from delayed referrals and delays to treatment, a think tank warns.","Waiting lists for hospital treatment could more than double by April and hit 10 million in England, the Reform think tank is warning. A worst-case scenario could see delays continue as a new wave of referrals are made, Reform said. Treatment referrals by GPs were six million lower in 2020 than the year before, suggesting a mounting backlog. Chris Hopson, chief executive of NHS Providers, said ""trumpeting worst-case scenarios"" was ""not helpful"". He said while there was a ""significant problem"" which would take time and investment to overcome, a similar methodology had suggested waiting lists would hit 10 million by December last year, but they were currently at 4.4 million. He also warned the NHS is likely to be ""at full stretch"" for at least another six weeks and England was still ""some way away"" from being able to start lifting restrictions. Are you waiting for hospital treatment? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803 Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Mr Hopson, whose organisation represents NHS trusts in England, has written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson to say case numbers are ""still far too high"" to end virus curbs. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the end of April, once the top nine priority groups had been vaccinated would be the ""logical point at which we can start considering easing restrictions"". Setting out the conditions they believe are needed to allow current restrictions to relax, trust leaders outlined four tests that could be applied. Among the tests are: a ""significant"" drop in case numbers; a return to normal NHS capacity; solid progress with vaccinations; and a ""robust and effective"" strategy to identify new virus variants. NHS long waits 100 times higher than before Covid Ambulance wait times in England 'off the scale' 'Years' before NHS waiting lists back to normal Mr Johnson is due to outline a roadmap for easing the current national lockdown in England on Monday. Meanwhile, the head of the UK's vaccine taskforce, Clive Dix, told Sky News all adultscould be fully vaccinated by August,external""or maybe sooner if we need to"". Reform - a centre-right think tank that focuses on public services - praised the work of frontline NHS staff, but said more now needed to be done to tackle the growing backlog in care. Community diagnostic centres for cancer, cardiac and other conditions should be set up to restart screening programmes halted by the pandemic, coupled with a renewed focus on prioritising those most urgently in need of care currently on waiting lists, it said. And for routine treatments, it said more use should be made of the private sector. Reform's Eleonora Harwich said: ""We must never have the equivalent of a 'National Covid Service' again. ""This is a system problem and in no way detracts from the heroic effort of NHS staff battling Covid-19. ""However, the cessation of so much non-Covid care means patients are facing more serious health conditions or disabilities, and some will die prematurely."" Layla McCay, director of policy at the NHS Confederation, which represents hospital bosses, accepted the NHS faced a ""mammoth task"" to tackle the backlog - although she questioned the waiting list prediction of 10 million people by April. She said the real problem was that the NHS was under-funded and had been operating ""at the top of its capacity for far too long"". LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SOCIAL DISTANCING:How can I meet my friend safely? OXFORD JAB:What is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? Responding to accusations that the NHS has become a Covid-only service, Ms McCay pointed out cancer services were now operating at pre-pandemic levels. Mr Hopson also said that Reform's suggestion that the NHS had been a ""Covid-only service"" was not helpful as staff had worked hard to keep other services going. Prof Neil Mortensen, of the Royal College of Surgeons of England, said tackling the backlog would require both the use of the private sector, and extra investment in the NHS. A further 10,625 new coronavirus cases were reported on Tuesday, alongside another 799 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.

Trump: McConnell is 'dour political hack',"While he was in office, Trump believed McConnell was a close ally Former President Donald Trump has launched a scathing personal attack on fellow Republican Mitch McConnell. ""Mitch is a dour, sullen, and unsmiling political hack,"" said Mr Trump, ""and if Republican Senators are going to stay with him, they will not win again."" His statement came after Mr McConnell said the former president was ""morally responsible"" for the US Capitol riots. The exchange exposed an apparent rift between the two over the future of the Republican party. The majority of Republican senators backed Mr Trump in his impeachment trial last week, including Mr McConnell who voted to acquit. But in a speech on the Senate floor, Mr McConnell implied the former president should face criminal and civil litigation because he was ""still liable for everything he did while in office"". What next for Trump - and Trumpism? Where does the Republican Party go after Trump? He said Mr Trump's actions prior to the riots on 6 January amounted to ""a disgraceful dereliction of duty"". The feud has prompted concern among some Republicans about the impact it may have on next year's mid-term elections. The party is trying to regroup having lost the House, the Senate and the presidency. ""I'm more worried about 2022 than I've ever been,"" Senator Lindsey Graham told Fox News. ""I don't want to eat our own,"" he added. ""We need to knock this off."" Mr Trump responded on Tuesday with his lengthiest statement since he left office a month ago. ""The Republican Party can never again be respected or strong with political 'leaders' like Senator Mitch McConnell at its helm,"" the press release reads. Mr McConnell's ""lack of political insight, wisdom, skill, and personality"" cost the Republicans control of the Senate following last November's elections, he said. Two closely-contested run-off votes in Georgia saw the Republicans lose both seats to Democrats, resulting in a 50-50 split of seats in the Senate.  This leaves the Democrats in control because Vice-President Kamala Harris has the casting vote in the case of a tie. The Republican dilemma, embodied in one politician Rising stars of a post-Trump Republican party in spotlight Mr Trump also took aim at Mr McConnell's stated intentions to stand in the way of future Trump-backed candidates. The former president said he would back Republican primary challengers who ""espouse Making America Great Again and our policy of America First"". Mr McConnell ""will never do what needs to be done, or what is right for our Country,"" said Mr Trump. Politico reported that an early draft was even more personal, witha source telling the site it said Mr McConnell had ""too many chins but not enough smarts"".,external Donald Trump's Twitter ban may mean that he has lost his favourite way of lobbing attacks at his opponents, but his latest press release about Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell shows he hasn't lost his bite. There's a lot of invective in the eight-paragraph diatribe from the former president, but the line that will give the Republicans the most heartburn is toward the end, when he says he will back primary challenges against members of his own party ""where necessary and appropriate"". It's telling that as Mr Trump prepares to re-enter the fray after his impeachment trial, he does so with an attack on his own party, not the Democrats. Trump may eventually take aim at Joe Biden and the left, but the political warfare Trump appears most interested in at the moment is of the internecine variety. The two Republicans shared a cordial working relationship throughout Mr Trump's presidency. That changed, however, after Mr Trump lost the presidential election. Mr McConnell said he had not spoken to Mr Trump since mid-December. The rift between them was exacerbated after the Capitol riots, which led to the deaths of five people including a police officer. Capitol riots timeline: How the day unfolded Capitol riots: Who has the FBI arrested so far? Mr Trump, who was impeached by the House of Representatives over the violence, was acquitted by the Senate on charges of inciting the insurrection. Only seven Republicans joined the Democrats in voting to convict Mr Trump. Mr McConnell and 42 other Republicans voted to acquit. A two-thirds vote was needed to convict. What verdict means for Trump, Biden and America Despite voting to acquit, Mr McConnell excoriated the former president on the Senate floor after the vote. This video can not be played The debate that led to Donald Trumpâs acquittal ""There is no question, none, that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day,"" he said. ""A mob was assaulting the Capitol in his name,"" he added. ""These criminals were carrying his banners, hanging his flags and screaming their loyalty to him."" The relationship between Mr Trump and Mr McConnell is not the only one to have soured over the past month. On Tuesday, an adviser to Mr Trump said that former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani has stopped doing legal work for the former president. Mr Giuliani is ""not currently representing President Trump in any legal matters,"" Jason Miller told CNN. Mr Trump reportedly tried to stop paying Mr Giuliani's legal fees in a fit of irritation about being impeached a second time, US media reported in January. But Mr Miller clarified on Twitter after the interview that Mr Giuliani remains ""an ally and a friend"". What questions do you have about the US?

The pandemic's toll on children,"They are not likely to get seriously ill with Covid and there have been very few deaths. But children are still the victims of the virus - and our response to it - in many other ways. From increasing rates of mental health problems to concerns about rising levels of abuse and neglect and the potential harm being done to the development of babies, the pandemic is threatening to have a devastating legacy on the nation's young. The closure of schools is, of course, damaging to children's education. But schools are not just a place for learning. They are places where kids socialise, develop emotionally and, for some, a refuge from troubled family life. Prof Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, perhaps put it most clearly when he told MPs on the Education Select Committee earlier this month: ""When we close schools we close their lives."" He says the pandemic has caused a range of harms to children across the board from being isolated and lonely to suffering from sleep problems andreduced physical activity - alongside school closures all children's sport is currently banned as it has been at various points during the pandemic. The only exception is for organised outdoor sport for the under 12s in Scotland. Many experts are baffled by the approach to children's sport given the low risks of transmission outdoors and the clear benefits for emotional and physical wellbeing - the UK has some of the highest rates of child obesity in the world. But it's not just the closure of schools. The stress the pandemic has put on families, with rising levels of unemployment and financial insecurity combined with the stay-at-home orders, has put strain on home life up and down the land. The NSPCC says the amount of counselling for loneliness provided by its Childline service has risen by 10% since the pandemic started. Neil Homer, who has been volunteering for the service since 2009, has never known anything like it. ""It's had a devastating impact,"" he says. The experience of this 16-year-old is typical of the calls that come in. ""I feel really sad and lonely. Most days I find myself just lost in my own thoughts and feeling numb."" Unsurprisingly, there are clear signs the upheaval in children's lives is having an impact on children's mental health. The Mental Health of Children and Young People in England 2020 report,external, which is produced by NHS Digital and the Office for National Statistics, is the official stocktake of the state of children's well-being. It has been tracking more than 3,000 young people over the last four years. Its latest findings, published in the autumn, found overall one in six children aged five to 16 had a probable mental health disorder, up from one in nine three years previously. Older girls had the highest rates. Children involved in the research cited family tensions and financial concerns as well as feeling isolated from friends and fear about the virus for causing their distress. Older teenagers and adolescents have been affected too as they have seen their prospects shrink. The Youth Index,published in January by the Prince's Trust in partnership with YouGov,external, has been tracking the well-being of young people aged 16 to 25 for 12 years. It found more than half of young people were always or often feeling anxious - the highest level ever recorded. Jonathan Townsend, of The Prince's Trust, fears young people are ""losing all hope for their future"". At the opposite end of the age spectrum, health visitors, who support parents and babies during the early years, are worried about the impact on newborns. Research shows the first two to three years of a baby's life is the most crucial period of human development. This has become known as the 1,001 days agenda. If children fall behind, they can find themselves at a lifelong disadvantage. The Institute of Health Visiting says services have been badly hit during the pandemic with these specialist nurses pulled away from their duties to help out on the Covid front line. In some areas, health visitor numbers have dropped by half. This and the social distancing rules mean for a lot of parents the only support they have received has been online. Meanwhile, the absence of baby and parent groups, and the friendships that naturally develop from them, has meant the babies of the pandemic have not benefited from the stimulus of social contact that is vital to their development. Alison Morton, head of the Institute of Health Visiting, says this has been an ""invisible"" cost of the pandemic, but one that will have a lasting impact, particularly in the most deprived areas. Babies and children, she says, are being ""harmed"" by what she says is the secondary indirect impact of the virus. There are around one million children with special educational needs and disabilities - around one in 10 of whom have complex and life-limiting conditions, such as severe cerebral palsy or cystic fibrosis. The nature of the pandemic and the response to it have created even greater challenges for many of these children and their families. Those with the most complex conditions can require care at home from specialist nurses and carers. This has become harder to obtain as staff have been redeployed or charities forced to cut back on their support networks. For those with compromised immune systems, shielding has been a constant almost throughout. Dame Christine Lenehan, director of the Council for Disabled Children, says in some cases children have ended up ""incarcerated"" in their homes. ""There are some who have barely had any formal education since lockdown began."" She says even those who are the most independent have struggled, with many schools - she estimates more than half - unable to address the additional learning needs of children with special needs who are learning remotely. For some children, the pandemic has had dire consequences with the numbers being harmed and abused on the rise. Between April and Septemberthere were 285 reports by councils of child deaths and incidents of serious harm,external, which includes child sexual exploitation. This was a rise of more than a quarter on the same period the year before. But children's commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, is worried this is just the tip of the iceberg, arguing the lockdowns, closure of schools and stay-at-home orders have led to a generation of vulnerable children becoming ""invisible"" to social workers. Referrals that would normally come in from a variety of sources, form health visitors to school nurses, dropped last year. This, she says, makes no sense given the impact of the pandemic on family life. Figures show that before the pandemic there were already more than two million children in England and Wales living in households affected by one of the ""toxic trio"" - domestic abuse, parental drug and alcohol dependency or severe mental health issues. The fear is this will have risen significantly. The governments across the UK, of course, maintain they have prioritised children. Investment has been made in mental health services and schools are being prioritised as the first thing to open once lockdown starts to lift. But is this enough? Research by Ms Longfield's organisation shows only one in three children who needed mental health support was getting it before the pandemic - and she believes that will now be even worse given the impact of the pandemic on both services and mental health. She warns that children will be living with the legacy of the pandemic for ""years to come"", particularly those from disadvantaged communities, and wants to see a major investment in support for children. Sunil Bhopal, an expert in child health at Newcastle University, agrees. He says too many people dismiss the impact on children, claiming they are ""resilient"" and will ""bounce back"". He believes this is misguided and instead growing up in a world where even ""playing with your friends is illegal"" threatens to cause long-lasting damage to many. ""I don't think it is an exaggeration to say children and their families have been abandoned.""

Vulnerable children 'let down',"Anne Longfield has been England's children's commissioner for six years Children exploited by gangs are being failed by adults who ""simply don't see them"", the Children's Commissioner for England has said. In her final speech in the role, Anne Longfield highlighted the case of 16-year-old Jacob, who died after being coerced into drug trafficking. She condemned the ""national scandal"" of a fifth of children leaving school without basic qualifications. The government said it had prioritised protecting vulnerable children. The children's commissioner's six-year term ends this month, and she spoke earlier to a virtual conference of more than 2,000 people. Jacob, 16, was found dead in his bedroom in April 2019. A serious case review showed he had not been provided any type of education for 21 months. The reportexposed failings by the local authorities and police, which left him to be targeted by so-called ""county lines"" gangs. Ms Longfield said Jacob was just one of many young people failed by Whitehall officials who need to rethink their priorities. ""I have been shocked to discover how many of these officials have never met any of the children they are responsible for,"" she said ""So many seem to view them as remote concepts or data points on an annual return. ""This is how children fall through the gaps - because too often the people in charge of the systems they need simply don't see them and try to understand their world."" Jacob was ""coerced and controlled"" into committing crimes for drug gangs Ms Longfield also mentioned Corey Junior Davis and Jaden Moodie, two other children ""caught up in gang violence who were let down by a succession of adults whose job it was to keep them safe"". She said the ""basic flaw"" in how the government works is that ""different parts of the system know different areas of these children's lives, but nobody connects the dots"". In her speech, she called for the government's ""build back better"" strategy to focus on ""rethinking our priorities and the way we care for children"". She said: ""It's impossible to overstate how damaging the last year has been for many children. ""Covid is the biggest challenge to our society in 70 years. But also an opportunity to reflect and rebuild."" Jacob, from Banbury, was coerced into a life of crime, and the report said his schooling absence played a ""significant role"" in leaving him vulnerable to being exploited. He was recorded as a suspect or an offender in 26 police reports, mostly for violent crimes, but was never brought before the courts. Ms Longfield said: ""This was not some evil criminal mastermind. ""This was a child who the report says talked to his friend about buying a school uniform and walking into school, just to feel like the other kids."" A coroner concluded he was ""intoxicated and distressed"" when he died but said there was ""insufficient evidence"" that he intended to kill himself. Investigators found there was ""a lack of responsibility and accountability"" in the council's education department. Right to left: Councillors Ian Hudspeth, Steve Harrod and Lorraine Lyndsay-Gale all declined to comment on the council's failings Oxfordshire County Council admitted ""more should have been done"" but has refused to answer further questions on the case. Thames Valley Police said it recognised it did not get the ""balance right"" in Jacob's case between ""dealing with children who are exploited but may also pose a risk to and offend against others"". A government spokesperson said: ""Protecting vulnerable children has been at the heart of our response to the pandemic, driven by our commitment to level up opportunities and outcomes. ""Anne Longfield has been a tireless advocate for children, and we're grateful for her dedication and her challenge on areas where we can continue raising the bar for the most vulnerable.""

Children 'failed' by care system,"The most vulnerable children are being ""failed by the state"" and a broken residential care system, the children's commissioner for England has said. Greater use of private provision has led to a fragmented, unco-ordinated and irrational system amid ""significant profits"", said Anne Longfield. The system has been allowed to slip deeper into crisis, she said. The government said an independent review of children's social care would begin ""as soon as possible"". Ms Longfield has published three reports detailing the plight of children the system ""doesn't know what to do with"". She said the government has failed to respond to previous warnings that thousands of these children are in danger of becoming victims of criminal and sexual exploitation. Older children were found to be living in ""disgusting"" conditions akin to a prison cell, one of the reports said. It described how one 17-year-old said her accommodation was filthy and smelly, with just one working shower - covered in mould - between 14 children and young adults. ""Elsewhere children have told us they have not even been provided with the means to eat or sleep - things like duvet covers, plates or cutlery,"" the same report said. Unregulated homes 'inappropriate' for under 18s Children in care 'moved around like parcels' Councils 'in red over child protection' All three reports highlight a shortage of children's home places, resulting in: 8,000 children moving between three or more homes within a year 13,000 children in unregulated homes at some point during a year hundreds unable to get places in a secure children's homes ""Only last month, a High Court judge wrote to me after an extremely vulnerable child in care could not get a suitable care home place anywhere in the country, even though the courts had found their life was in danger,"" said Ms Longfield. ""These shocking cases used to be rare but are now routine, and I am worried the whole system is becoming immune to the devastating effect this is having on children who may have previously been abused and neglected, or have serious mental or physical health needs."" One of the reports analyses how, over the past decade, as demand for care has grown and local authority provision has failed to keep pace, private provision has expanded. The researchers found the majority of private provision was rated good or outstanding by Ofsted, although smaller providers were more likely to have lower ratings than either larger providers or local authorities. Some providers are owned by private equity companies and carry ""significant amounts of debt"" which could ""risk their stability"", says the report. ""Both the government and councils have failed in their responsibilities by leaving it to the market,"" said Ms Longfield. ""The growing reliance on private providers, some of whom are making millions, is another symptom of a system failing to prioritise the needs of children."" Iryna Pona, policy manager at the Children's Society, said the reports were enormously worrying but not surprising. ""The Children's Society is very concerned about how children in care are being failed by the very services who are supposed to be caring for and protecting them,"" she said. This video can not be played The findings of a 2019 BBC investigation on children in care were called ""a scandal"" The Local Government Association, which represents councils across England, says it shares the commissioner's concerns about the risk of businesses running children's homes going bust asadult care provider Southern Cross did, almost a decade ago. ""Providers should also not be making excessive profit from providing placements for children,"" said Judith Blake, who chairs the LGA's Children and Young People Board. A Department for Education statement said: ""The education secretary has been clear that no child should be denied the opportunity for a loving, stable family life, or be bounced around the care system in accommodation that does not meet their needs. ""We have also set out that children under the age of 16 should not be living in unregulated homes. ""Our bold, broad and independently led care review will launch as soon as possible, and will support improvements in the children's social care system.""

"Don't raid green homes scheme, MPs urge ministers","MPs are complaining that the Treasury is set to claw back money from a mismanaged government scheme to help people insulate their homes. The Green Homes Grant scheme is in such chaos that a huge majority of its Â£1.5bn budget for this year is unspent. The government has said it will pocket that money, rather than rolling it over to next yearâs Â£320m fund. But the Environmental Audit Committee says that would be a âdeeply retrograde stepâ. Conservative MP Philip Dunne, who chairs the committee, told the BBC: âWe need a long-term commitment to helping people insulate their homes â at the very least until the end of this Parliament. âWe (Conservatives) promised Â£9.2bn for energy efficiency in our manifesto â and we have to deliver that or we wonât reach our climate change targets.â The governmentâs advisory Climate Change Committee says even more - Â£2bn of public money a year - is needed until 2030. Free home insulation: Too good to be true? MPs criticise government home insulation programme Government 'not checking' if green taxes work The current green homes programme has been heavily criticised, with householders unable to get quotes from registered contractors and the firms unable to get paid. In a parliamentary answer on Tuesday, the government confirmed only Â£94.1m of the Â£1.5bn allocated for homes in England until April has so far been spent. Mr Dunne said: âThe Green Homes Grant scheme is a good idea but its implementation has been woeful."" He said the scheme designed to create jobs and improve energy efficiency had turned into a âjob destructionâ scheme because so many builders laid off their workers when government payments didn't come through. Mr Dunne said the project had been devised with too much bureaucracy because Treasury officials didnât want a repeat of Northern Ireland'sNorthern Ireland's ""cash for ash"" renewable heat scheme,where millions of pounds were lost because rules were badly devised. As a result of the red tape, he said, small builders in the Federation of Master Builders were reluctant to apply for accreditation. Mr Dunne said out of 7,400 members of the federation, only three had been accredited. Mr Dunneâs committee says the government needs to invest heavily in carbon-cutting measures as part of the its response to Covid-19. In a report, it has urged the government to create âgreenâ jobs by investing in areas such as energy efficiency, nature recovery and adaptation to a heating climate. It wants the government to: Invest more in walking and cycling Promote electric vehicles and batteries Prompt the Bank of England to âgreenâ its activities Reduce VAT on repairs and energy efficient upgrades in homes Consider a carbon tax, with levies on high-carbon imports Mr Dunne said: âThe Covid-19 crisis must be treated as a wake-up call - it is a symptom of a growing ecological emergency. âA tax system fit for net-zero Britain is key. It will encourage innovation, give confidence to the sector and support companies to make the low-carbon transition.â The MPs also say ministers should also set targets forthe huge amounts of carbon generatedto make steel and cement for new buildings. This idea is gaining traction, because it would increase the use in construction of wood products that have soaked up CO2. Will Hurst from the Architects' Journal said: ""For far too long we have ignored the carbon footprints of (constructing) buildings, worrying only about their energy efficiency once built. ""Regulations actually encourage this state of affairs. The VAT system perversely incentivises wasteful demolition and rebuild while upfront or âembodiedâ carbon emissions in construction are largely ignored in planning policy."" Caterina Brandmayr from the think tank Green Alliance said: âThe report rightly puts the spotlight on what the government still needs to do to deliver a green recovery. âFront-loading investment in climate solutions, nature and the circular economy, and ensuring recovery plans are consistent with climate and environmental goals must be a priority. This will help create jobs, and benefit businesses and communities across the country.â A government spokesman said the Treasury was examining ways to fund the UK's transition to net zero emissions and ministers were ""committed to building back better and greener from the pandemic"". The prime minister's recently announced 10-pointclimate change planwill ""put the UK at the forefront of the global green industrial revolution and create hundreds of thousands of green jobs,"" the spokesman added. ""We continue to bring forward bold measures to cut emissions, with plans to invest Â£9bn in improving the energy efficiency of buildings forming part of our wider commitment to end our contribution to climate change by 2050.""

China overtakes US as EU's biggest trading partner,"China is now the EU's biggest trading partner, overtaking the US in 2020. China bucked a wider trend, as trade with most of Europe's major partners dipped due to the Covid-19 pandemic. Trade between China and the EU was worth $709bn (â¬586bn, Â£511bn) last year, compared with $671bn worth of imports and exports from the US. Although China's economy cratered in the first quarter due to the pandemic, its economic recovery later in the year fuelled demand for EU goods. New WTO boss warns against vaccine nationalism China takes new foreign investment top spot from US Cognac targeted with tariffs in US-EU trade row China was the only major global economy to see growth in 2020, stoking demand for European cars and luxury goods. Meanwhile, China's exports to Europe benefited from strong demand for medical equipment and electronics. ""In the year 2020, China was the main partner for the EU. This result was due to an increase of imports (+5.6%) and exports (+2.2%),"" according to Eurostat, the EU's statistical office. The figures were similar to China's official data published in January, which showed trade with the EU grew by 5.3% to $696.4bn in 2020. The EU's trade deficit with China also grew from $199bn to $219bn according to Eurostat figures, which were released on Monday. Although the US and the UK remain the EU's largest export markets, trade with both countries dropped significantly, the statistics showed. ""Trade with the United States recorded a significant drop in both imports (-13.2%) and exports (-8.2%),"" the data agency said. Transatlantic trade has been hit by a series of tit-for-tat disputes that have resulted in tariffs on steel and products such as French Cognac or American Harley-Davidson motorcycles. In 2020, the US had a trade volume of $671bn with the EU, down from $746bn the previous year. This video can not be played WTO head warns against vaccine nationalism It's not year clear if new US President Joe Biden will re-evaluate the US approach to trade with Europe. The EU and China, however, are trying to deepen their economic ties, with both sides seeking to ratify an investment deal that would give European companies better access to the Chinese market. Analysts are tipping global trade to turn around in 2021 after a lacklustre 2020. The real value of global trade is set to rise by 7.6% after an an estimated contraction of 13.5% in 2020 to $16.4tn, according to research firm IHS Markit.

"Make children priority after Covid, watchdog saysEngland's children's commissioner calls on Boris Johnson to put them ""centre stage"" of his plans.England","Vulnerable children must be at the heart of government plans to ""build back better"" after the pandemic, England's children's commissioner says. Anne Longfield called on Boris Johnson to put them at the ""centre stage"" of plans to ""level up"" the nation. In a final speech after six years in the role, she said it was a ""terrible thing"" that ""most of their lives would have got worse"" during the pandemic. Ministers said protecting vulnerable children was central to its response. A spokesperson added: ""That's why we have enabled the most vulnerable children to continue attending school in person, while providing laptops, devices and data packages to those learning at home and ensuring the most disadvantaged children are fed and warm."" It comes after warnings that children may be ""losing all hope for their future"" and as surveys suggest young people's mental health is worsening, partly due to the fallout from Covid-19. The devastating toll of the pandemic on children Lockdown 'sees vulnerable children slip from view' Children 'failed' by broken care system Ms Longfield said the prime minister's commitment to putting schools at the heart of reopening of society when lockdown eases was ""really welcome"". ""There have been points during the year where I was dismayed when schools stayed shut and shops and pubs opened but the prime minister's come behind what we were pushing for which was for the schools to be the last last to close and the first to open,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. She estimated around Â£10bn will be needed for children's mental health support and help for pupils in school to catch-up. Ms Longfield said she believed Boris Johnson wants to ""build back better"" for children but did not think he has the ""structures in government around him"" to be able to do that. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN RULES:What are they and when will they end? SOCIAL DISTANCING:How can I meet my friend safely? OXFORD JAB:What is the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine? Tory MP Robert Halfon, the chairman of the Education Select Committee, said the pandemic had ""laid bare the damning truth about our educational divide"". In a response to Ms Longfield's speech,Mr Halfon said on Twitter,externalthat children were facing a ""torrid barrage of lost learning and a new frontier of vulnerabilities"". He urged ministers to focus on the ""complex challenges that exist in some children's lives"", adding that the school closures could reverse the progress made since 2011. Ms Longfield said her departing address aimed to set out a ""challenge to government and all political parties"". An entire generation risks being defined by the coronavirus crisis and some children may start school so far behind their peers ""they'll never catch up"", she said. But she said while the pandemic meant the country was facing the ""biggest challenge to our society in 70 years, it is also an opportunity to reflect and rebuild"". Ms Longfield suggested the Â£1.5bn so far committed to a pupil catch-up fundÂ for England was a demonstration of the Treasury's ""institutional bias against children"" - when compared with aresearch group's estimate that children are facing up to Â£350bn in lost earningsas a result of school closures.Â She highlighted US President Joe Biden's new package of tax credits and benefits for families with children as an example of the type of action the government could take. Mr Johnson's promise to ""level up"" the country will be ""just a slogan"" unless children are at the heart of the effort, she added. Ms Longfield said ministers had focused too much on school improvements ""without recognising that many of the outcomes for the children attending the schools are overall getting worse"". Calling for a new ""Covid Covenant"" of education and well-being support in every community, she said school holidays should be used to catch children up with lost lessons. The children's commissioner said is a ""national scandal"" the fact almost a fifth of children in England leave school or college without basic qualifications. And highlighting the case of a 16-year-old who died after being coerced into drug trafficking, she said children exploited by gangsare being failed by adults who ""simply don't see them"". A government spokesman said its long-term catch-up plans would combine with an investment of more than Â£1bn to ""ensure we make up for lost time in education over the course of this Parliament"". He added: ""Anne Longfield has been a tireless advocate for children, and we're grateful for her dedication and her challenge on areas where we can continue raising the bar for the most vulnerable.""

'Self-isolation cost my family Â£700',"Tracy Moore and her husband Jason lost hundreds of pounds when they were told to isolate Self-isolation is costing people who do not qualify for financial support hundreds of pounds in lost income. Most applications to Wales' Â£500 self-isolation grant scheme have been rejected. The Welsh Government announced on Wednesday it is expanding the scheme to make more people eligible. Tracy Moore, from Flintshire, saw her household income fall about Â£700 last month, andtold BBC Wales Livethe way the support system worked was ""wrong"". Since the coronavirusself-isolation support programmeopened in November, 27,209 applications have been made in Wales. Of those, 8,421 were approved, 15,772 rejected and 3,016 had a decision pending as of 2 February. Will I get paid if I self-isolate? Covid self-isolation shortened to 10 days Payment for people told to isolate by app in Wales Self-isolation without grant 'a kick in the teeth' The Welsh Government said feedback from councils suggested rejected applications were mainly due to individuals being ineligible or not providing the necessary evidence. Under the existing system, applicants must stand to lose income by isolating, and be on at least one of a range of benefits. The government is now expanding the scheme to include people not on any benefits but with a personal income of less than Â£500 net per week or on basic statutory sick pay. Ministers said the changes would make an additional 170,000 people potentially eligible for the grant, with the scheme extended to June. The new rules will not be backdated. Ms Moore, from Holywell, saw her household income drop by about Â£700 when her husband Jason and son isolated last month. They work for a Tarmac company and shared their van with someone who tested positive the following day. They called 111 and were advised to isolate for 10 days. But when they tried to apply for financial help they were told they were not eligible as they had not formally been asked to isolate by Test, Trace, Protect. Another 111 call handler later said they should not have been told to isolate. People living in Wales and England have been urged to download the NHS contact-tracing app Ms Moore is disabled and does not work, so the household income took a hit. ""The bills have all been paid but it was not very nice. The way the system works is disgusting and wrong,"" she said. Lynette Jackson, from Wrexham, lost about Â£400 when she isolated in the run-up to Christmas after a colleague at her factory tested positive. When she applied for a discretionary payment she was told she was too late as 17 days had passed since her isolation ended. ""I did what I was meant to do. I think people will stop doing it if they're losing money,"" she said. ""I would only isolate again in the future if I'm ill, I can't afford to do it again."" One self-employed woman from Cardiff said she would not qualify for the grant so is avoiding getting tested and will ignore calls from contact tracers. ""I've done everything to avoid being told to isolate,"" she added. ""If it's a choice between paying rent and bills vs self-isolating I'm going to pay the bills."" But Helen Harris, from Newport, did receive the payment and said it was a ""such a relief"", with her baby Arwen currently in hospital for heart treatment. Helen is on maternity leave and her husband Andrew lost about Â£700 when they had to isolate. This video can not be played People may not isolate if they have financial worries, Helen Harris says ""I've been completely worried anyway... and then obviously we had the financial worries about if we could keep the house, if we could pay the bills,"" she said. ""It's just a massive weight off our mind, it's just something we don't have to worry about because it means that the money's now there for us to pay the bills that we need."" Ms Harris said she felt for people who are not given the grant. ""The government should definitely be supporting people because people are struggling with mental health and everything, they need to know they can pay their bills,"" she added. A Swansea University study of people asked to self-isolate in Wales found more than a quarter of those surveyed said it negatively affected their income. Local government minister Julie James said feedback from councils showed the scheme was working well, but lack of income was still being reported as a barrier for self-isolating. ""Self-isolation is key if we are to stop the spread of coronavirus and with more community testing programmes planned in the coming months it is vital we enhance the scheme to help more people self-isolate and receive the financial support they need,"" she said. Plaid Cymru's shadow minister for finance and health, Rhun ap Iorwerth, said: ""Self-isolation remains a vital part of stopping the spread of coronavirus, and fear of financial hardship is one of the barriers to effective self-isolation. ""If support isn't sufficient, and isn't reaching the right people, our efforts to tackle the pandemic suffer."" He called for the payment to be brought up to Â£800 and said it will be an ""important step"" in tackling the virus as we come out of lockdown. More on this story on Wales Live on BBC One Wales at 22:35 GMT on Wednesday The pandemic has had a huge impact on people's day-to-day lives in Wales, with mental health problems worsening across different age groups in the past year. In adults, the proportion ofindividuals showing symptoms of depression,externalhas almost doubled since the start of the pandemic, the Office for National Statistics says. And Covid-19 has had a""crushing impact""on the lives of children and young people, according to the Children's Commissioner for Wales.

Hey's review indicated that two-thirds of emails sent to its users' personal accounts contained a ""spy pixel"", even after excluding for spam. Its makers said that many of the largest brands used email pixels, with the exception of the ""big tech"" firms. Defenders of the trackers say they are a commonplace marketing tactic. And several of the companies involved noted their use of such tech was mentioned within their wider privacy policies. Emails pixels can be used to log: if and when an email is opened how many times it is opened what device or devices are involved the user's rough physical location, deduced from their internet protocol (IP) address - in some cases making it possible to see the street the recipient is on This information can then be used to determine the impact of a specific email campaign, as well as to feed into more detailed customer profiles. Hey's co-founder David Heinemeier Hansson says they amount to a ""grotesque invasion of privacy"". Without special software, it is not easy to spot which emails contain a tracking pixel And other experts have also questioned whether companies are being as transparent as required under law about their use. Tracking pixels are typically a .GIF or .PNG file that is as small as 1x1 pixels, which is inserted into the header, footer or body of an email. Since they often show the colour of the content below, they can be impossible to spot with the naked eye even if you know where to look. Recipients do not need to click on a link or do anything to activate them beyond open an email they are embedded in. British Airways, TalkTalk, Vodafone, Sainsbury's, Tesco, HSBC, Marks & Spencer, Asos and Unilever are among UK brands Hey detected to be using them. But their use was much more widespread despite many members of the public being unaware of it, said Mr Hansson. ""It's not like there's a flag saying 'this email includes a spy pixel' in most email software,"" he added. Hey does offer such a facility, but users must pay an annual subscription. Hey alerts its customers to the use of pixel trackers and automatically blocks them Alternatively, users can install free plug-ins into other email programs to strip out many pixel trackers. Other options are to simply set their software to block all images by default, or to view emails as plain text. ""On average, every Hey customer receives 24 emails per day that attempt to spy on them,"" Mr Hansson said. ""The top 10% of users receive more than 50. ""We're processing over one million emails a day and we're just a tiny service compared to the likes of Gmail, but that's north of 600,000 spying attempts blocked every day."" The BBC also uses email pixels in some of its communications, although this was not picked up by Hey. Tracking pixels are a standard feature of automated email services used by large and small businesses, and in many cases the facility is difficult to turn off. Two years ago Superhuman, a consumer-focused email client, tried to extend their use to the public as a default feature of its own, butreversed course after a public outcry,external. That had little impact on the marketing industry's continued reliance on the tech. Clients can use them to track how many emails in a specific campaign are opened in aggregate, as well as to automatically stop sending messages to customers who ignore them. But a study by Princeton University also indicated the data gathered was sometimes linked to a users' cookies. This allows an individual's email address to be tied to their wider browsing habits, even as they move from one device to another. ""The resulting links between identities and web history profiles belie the claim of 'anonymous' web tracking,""the paper warned,external. In addition, trackers can also lead to personalised follow-ups. Danish technologist David Heinemeier Hansson co-created the premium email service Hey in 2020 ""Particularly with salespeople or consultants, they can go: 'I saw you open my email yesterday, but you haven't replied yet. Can I call?'"" said Mr Hansson. ""And in some cases they get outright belligerent when they see you've opened it three times but have still not replied."" Use of tracking pixels is governed in the UK and other parts of Europe by 2003'sPrivacy and Electronic Communications Regulations,external(Pecr) and 2016'sGeneral Data Protection Regulation,external(GDPR). They require organisations to inform recipients of the pixels, and in most cases to obtain consent. One privacy consultant saidthe Court of Justice of the European Union,external(CJEU) had previously ruled that such consent must be ""unambiguous"" and ""a clear affirmative act"". ""Solely placing something in a privacy notice is not consent, and it is hardly transparent,"" said Pat Walshe from Privacy Matters. ""The fact that tracking will take place and what that involves should be put in the user's face and involve them opting in. ""The law is clear enough, what we need is regulatory enforcement. Just because this practice is widespread doesn't mean it's correct and acceptable."" Mr Walshe noted that the ICO had used a pixel within its own e-newsletter. The ICO tells users their interactions with its newsletter will be tracked on the sign-up form The watchdog told the BBC it was used to track email openings, but not users' locations, adding: ""We're working with our provider to remove the pixel functionality and this should be completed soon."" The BBC asked some of the companies identified by Hey for their own response. British Airways said: ""We take customer data extremely seriously, and use a cross-industry standard approach that allows us to understand how effective our customer communications are."" TalkTalk said: ""As is common across our industry and others, we track the performance of different types of communications to understand what our customers prefer. We do not share this data externally.""

UN to raise Princess Latifa case with UAEThe UN is analysing videos in which the daughter of Dubai's ruler says she fears for her life.Middle East,"This video can not be played Videos show Dubai's Princess Latifa in ""villa jail"" The United Nations has said it will raise the detention of Princess Latifa, the daughter of Dubai's ruler, with the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Princess Latifa has accused her father of holding her hostage in Dubai since she tried to flee the city in 2018. In secretly recorded videos shared with the BBC, Princess Latifa said she feared for her life. The footage prompted global calls for a UN investigation, while the UK said the videos were ""deeply troubling"". ""We are concerned about it,"" UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab said on Wednesday. He said the videos showed ""a young woman in deep distress"", adding that the UK would watch any developments from the UN ""very closely"". This video can not be played ""I've seen some of the footage and it's deeply troubling"" â UK Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab But when asked whether sanctions could be imposed, Mr Raab said: ""It's not clear to me that there would be the evidence to support that."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson also said the government was ""concerned"" but would ""wait and see how [the UN] get on"" with their investigation. The Office of the UN High Commissioner for Human Rights has said it would soon question the UAE about Princess Latifa. ""We will certainly raise these new developments with the UAE,"" spokesman Rupert Colville said. ""Other parts of the UN human rights system with relevant mandates may also become involved once they have analysed the new material"". Meanwhile, a spokesman said the UN Working Group on Arbitrary Detention could launch an investigation once Princess Latifa's videos have been analysed. Dubai's Princess Latifa before her escape attempt in 2018 ""We are hoping [a UN investigation] will be decisive in finally getting Princess Latifa released,"" Rodney Dixon, a lawyer who presented the case to the UN, told the BBC. ""The UN needs to have a very serious meeting directly with those who are holding [her] and make sure an agreement is reached so she can be released,"" he said. Mr Dixon added: ""The UN as the international body responsible for implementing international law can ensure that is exactly what happens."" Princess Latifa's father, Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum, is one of the richest heads of state in the world, the ruler of Dubai and vice-president of the UAE. The UAE has close relations with a number of Western countries, including the US and UK, which consider it a strategic ally. Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum is the 71-year-old billionaire ruler of Dubai Sheikh Mohammed has built a hugely successful city but rights activists say there is no tolerance of dissent and the judicial system can discriminate against women. With the help of friends, Princess Latifa tried to flee Dubai to start a new life in February 2018. ""I'm not allowed to drive, I'm not allowed to travel or leave Dubai at all,"" she said in a video recorded just before her escape. What are women's rights in Dubai? The princess who vanished Timeline: Failed escapes of sheikh's daughters Sheikh Mohammed Al Maktoum: Who is Dubai's ruler? But days later, the princess was captured by commandos on a boat in the Indian Ocean. She was flown back to Dubai, where she has remained ever since. Her father said he was acting in her best interests. Dubai and the UAE have previously said Princess Latifa was safe in the care of family. Ashitha Nagesh, BBC News Women in the UAE are allowed to drive, vote, work, and own and inherit property, making the country the second-best in the Middle East and North Africa (Mena) for gender equality,according to the World Economic Forum,external(WEF). But, to put this in context, the Mena region had the lowest score of all the regions. The UAE was ranked 120th in the world out of 153. There are still aspects of a woman's personal life in the country that are controlled by a male ""guardian"" - often a spouse or other male relative. Although the UAE isn't as strict as neighbouring Saudi Arabia, women still need their guardian's permission in order to get married. Divorce is also much harder for women; men don't need permission but women have to apply for a court order. And while the UAE does have an anti-discrimination law, sex and gender aren't included in its protected categories. Some laws have changed in the last few years, at least on the surface. An explicit permission for domestic violence was removed from the penal code in 2016. The requirement in the personal status law for women to ""obey"" their husbands was revoked in 2019, and the law was amended to make its language more gender-neutral. And last March a new law allowing women access to protection orders - such as restraining orders - came into effect. However, the new law defines domestic violence as abuse or threats that ""exceed [an individual's] guardianship, jurisdiction, authority or responsibility"", meaning it's ultimately down to judges to decide whether men have gone beyond their ""authority"" or not. In practice, protections for abuse victims are still weak. Sheikh Mohammed has a vast horse-racing enterprise and frequently attends major events such as Royal Ascot, where he has been pictured with Queen Elizabeth II. But he has faced severe criticism over the treatment of Princess Latifa and her stepmother, Princess Haya Bint Al Hussain, who fled to London in 2019 with her two children. ""There are no charges. It's pure punishment,"" Matthew Hedges,the British academic jailed for spying in the UAE in 2018, told the BBC when asked about the Princess Latifa case. ""There's no one looking out for her. It brings [my experiences] back quite dramatically,"" he added. Princess Latifa's videos were obtained by BBC Panorama, which has independently verified the details of where she was held. Watch the Missing Princess on BBC iPlayer The videos were recorded over several months on a phone she was secretly given about a year after her capture and return to Dubai. She recorded them in a bathroom as it had the only door she could lock. In the messages, she detailed how: she fought back against the soldiers taking her off the boat, ""kicking and fighting"" and biting one Emirati commando's arm until he screamed after being tranquillised she lost consciousness as she was being carried on to a private jet, and didn't wake up until it landed in Dubai she was being held alone without access to medical or legal help in a villa with windows and doors barred shut, and guarded by police Princess Latifa's account of her capture and detention was revealed by her close friend Tiina Jauhiainen, maternal cousin Marcus Essabri and campaigner David Haigh, who are all behind the Free Latifa campaign.

Trump: McConnell is 'dour political hack'Donald Trump railed against senior Republican Mitch McConnell for implying he incited the Capitol riot.US & Canada,"While he was in office, Trump believed McConnell was a close ally Former President Donald Trump has launched a scathing personal attack on fellow Republican Mitch McConnell. ""Mitch is a dour, sullen, and unsmiling political hack,"" said Mr Trump, ""and if Republican Senators are going to stay with him, they will not win again."" His statement came after Mr McConnell said the former president was ""morally responsible"" for the US Capitol riots. The exchange exposed an apparent rift between the two over the future of the Republican party. The majority of Republican senators backed Mr Trump in his impeachment trial last week, including Mr McConnell who voted to acquit. But in a speech on the Senate floor, Mr McConnell implied the former president should face criminal and civil litigation because he was ""still liable for everything he did while in office"". What next for Trump - and Trumpism? Where does the Republican Party go after Trump? He said Mr Trump's actions prior to the riots on 6 January amounted to ""a disgraceful dereliction of duty"". The feud has prompted concern among some Republicans about the impact it may have on next year's mid-term elections. The party is trying to regroup having lost the House, the Senate and the presidency. ""I'm more worried about 2022 than I've ever been,"" Senator Lindsey Graham told Fox News. ""I don't want to eat our own,"" he added. ""We need to knock this off."" Mr Trump responded on Tuesday with his lengthiest statement since he left office a month ago. ""The Republican Party can never again be respected or strong with political 'leaders' like Senator Mitch McConnell at its helm,"" the press release reads. Mr McConnell's ""lack of political insight, wisdom, skill, and personality"" cost the Republicans control of the Senate following last November's elections, he said. Two closely-contested run-off votes in Georgia saw the Republicans lose both seats to Democrats, resulting in a 50-50 split of seats in the Senate.  This leaves the Democrats in control because Vice-President Kamala Harris has the casting vote in the case of a tie. The Republican dilemma, embodied in one politician Rising stars of a post-Trump Republican party in spotlight Mr Trump also took aim at Mr McConnell's stated intentions to stand in the way of future Trump-backed candidates. The former president said he would back Republican primary challengers who ""espouse Making America Great Again and our policy of America First"". Mr McConnell ""will never do what needs to be done, or what is right for our Country,"" said Mr Trump. Politico reported that an early draft was even more personal, witha source telling the site it said Mr McConnell had ""too many chins but not enough smarts"".,external Donald Trump's Twitter ban may mean that he has lost his favourite way of lobbing attacks at his opponents, but his latest press release about Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell shows he hasn't lost his bite. There's a lot of invective in the eight-paragraph diatribe from the former president, but the line that will give the Republicans the most heartburn is toward the end, when he says he will back primary challenges against members of his own party ""where necessary and appropriate"". It's telling that as Mr Trump prepares to re-enter the fray after his impeachment trial, he does so with an attack on his own party, not the Democrats. Trump may eventually take aim at Joe Biden and the left, but the political warfare Trump appears most interested in at the moment is of the internecine variety. The two Republicans shared a cordial working relationship throughout Mr Trump's presidency. That changed, however, after Mr Trump lost the presidential election. Mr McConnell said he had not spoken to Mr Trump since mid-December. The rift between them was exacerbated after the Capitol riots, which led to the deaths of five people including a police officer. Capitol riots timeline: How the day unfolded Capitol riots: Who has the FBI arrested so far? Mr Trump, who was impeached by the House of Representatives over the violence, was acquitted by the Senate on charges of inciting the insurrection. Only seven Republicans joined the Democrats in voting to convict Mr Trump. Mr McConnell and 42 other Republicans voted to acquit. A two-thirds vote was needed to convict. What verdict means for Trump, Biden and America Despite voting to acquit, Mr McConnell excoriated the former president on the Senate floor after the vote. This video can not be played The debate that led to Donald Trumpâs acquittal ""There is no question, none, that President Trump is practically and morally responsible for provoking the events of the day,"" he said. ""A mob was assaulting the Capitol in his name,"" he added. ""These criminals were carrying his banners, hanging his flags and screaming their loyalty to him."" The relationship between Mr Trump and Mr McConnell is not the only one to have soured over the past month. On Tuesday, an adviser to Mr Trump said that former New York City mayor Rudy Giuliani has stopped doing legal work for the former president. Mr Giuliani is ""not currently representing President Trump in any legal matters,"" Jason Miller told CNN. Mr Trump reportedly tried to stop paying Mr Giuliani's legal fees in a fit of irritation about being impeached a second time, US media reported in January. But Mr Miller clarified on Twitter after the interview that Mr Giuliani remains ""an ally and a friend"". What questions do you have about the US?

Youngest pupils to return to Scotland's classrooms,"This video can not be played Covid: Youngest pupils to return to classrooms in Scotland The youngest pupils are to return to Scotland's classrooms for face-to-face teaching from next week. The move will see all children in P1 to P3 and those at pre-school returning from Monday 22 February. Other age groups will continue to learn from home, apart from some secondary pupils who need to complete coursework. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said it was unlikely that any other pupils would return to school before 15 March at the earliest. All other existing lockdown measures will all remain in place until at least the end of this month, with Ms Sturgeon warning that the country remains in a precarious position. The EIS teaching union said it still had significant concerns over school safety which had not yet been addressed, and a blended learning model - with around half of pupils in classes at any one time - would have more appropriate. The union's general secretary, Larry Flanagan, said: ""Everyone is supportive of face-to-face teaching returning as soon as possible - that should not override safety concerns, however, and teachers will be understandably nervous around today's announcement."" Live reaction to the lockdown review FM urges Scots not to book Easter holidays How soon will children return to school? Covid: Are teachers more at risk of dying? The Scottish government will draw up a ""revised strategic framework"" - to be published next week - to set out how Scotland can exit lockdown and what conditions will need to be met before restrictions can be eased. Will your child be returning to school on Monday?  Share your stories. WhatsApp:+44 7756 165803,external Tweet:@BBC_HaveYourSay,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy Ms Sturgeon said it was unlikely that hotels and holiday accommodation would be open again in time for people to book any sort of Easter break, but ""staycations"" may be possible by summer. In an update at Holyrood, Ms Sturgeon said she had ""more reason to be hopeful now than we did a few weeks ago"" that the race against the virus could be won, with the vaccination programme picking up pace while lockdown contains the spread of new cases. Teaching unions say they are concerned that the new variants of the virus could be more transmissible She said she was ""very hopeful that vaccination will start to have a significant impact in reducing the number of people who die from Covid"", saying there was already evidence of this in care homes. However, the first minister warned that ""our situation is still very fragile"", saying: ""Even a slight easing of restrictions could cause cases to start rising rapidly again"". While she said it would continue to be ""extremely cautious"", the government is focused on a ""gradual, phased return to as much normality as possible"". This is to begin with schools, with the youngest pupils to return to classrooms as soon as next week. But Ms Sturgeon said there would be trade-offs, adding: ""We are choosing to use the very limited headroom we have right now to get at least some children back to school - because children's education and wellbeing is such a priority. ""But being able to get children back to education may mean the rest of us living with some other restrictions for longer."" Careful, cautious, gradual are the watchwords for the easing of lockdown in Scotland. That is to say we're not going to get back the everyday freedoms we once took for granted, quickly. The stay at home instruction will remain in place into March, possibly longer, with the anniversary of the first lockdown drawing nearer. A further reopening of schools is a priority but will not happen before 15 March. Easter holidays are unlikely to be allowed at home or abroad. The same will probably apply to overseas holidays this summer. Why all this caution when the vaccination programme is now progressing at pace? Because, at this stage, ministers remain nervous that opening up too quickly could mean losing control of the virus again in the wider population. They are desperate to avoid a third lockdown later in the year. A return to local protection levels should form part of the exit plan to be announced next week. But expect the restrictions associated with each level to be tighter than before, given this system was overwhelmed as autumn turned to winter last year. The first pupils to return to schools will be those in preschools, those in P1, P2 and P3, and ""a limited number of senior phase students who need access to school for essential practical work"". Ministers hope to set out second phase of schools reopening in two weeks time, but Ms Sturgeon said there was ""unlikely to be any further return to school before 15 March"" so that the impact of the initial changes can be assessed. She said at-home testing sets would be provided to senior phase pupils, teachers and school staff once they do return, and that secondary pupils would have to maintain a 2m distance in school buildings. Plans for the ""gradual"" easing of the strict stay at home lockdown are set to include a return to a regional levels system. Ms Sturgeon said that ""caution will be necessary"", and that she would be clear about what will not be possible in the immediate future - including holidays. She said: ""We are likely to advise against booking Easter holidays, either overseas or within Scotland, as it is highly unlikely that we will have been able to fully open hotels of self-catering accommodation by then. ""However, for the summer, while it is still highly unlikely that overseas holidays will be possible or advisable, staycations might be - but this will depend on the data nearer the time."" Scottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson said it was ""very welcome news"" that schools could start opening again safely. However she said that ""to get us even closer to normality, we need to get all key workers vaccinated as early as we can"", saying government plans were ""short on detail"". And she urged the Scottish government to publish its plans for helping pupils to catch-up with the schooling they have missed, which she said should be built around a tutoring service to stop the attainment gap growing. Scottish Labour's interim leader Jackie Baillie also challenged Ms Sturgeon over the vaccine rollout, urging the first minister to commit to more ambitious targets for completing priority groups.
