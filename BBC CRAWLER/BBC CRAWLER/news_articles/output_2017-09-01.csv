Teen jailed for mass water fight attacks,"Joshua Clements stabbed two men when thousands gathered in London's Hyde park last year A teenager who stabbed two men during a mass water fight in London's Hyde Park has been jailed for 14 years. Joshua Clements, 19, attacked the men as violence broke out when thousands of people gathered on 19 July last year. The Old Bailey heard he was masked and armed with a large hunting knife, and planned to rob people at the event. He previously pleaded guilty to two charges of wounding and having an offensive weapon as well as two counts of handling stolen goods. Clements, who had been released from Feltham Young Offenders Institution two months before the attack, also admitted possession of heroin and crack cocaine with intent. Police found a hunting knife with student Audean Thompson's DNA on it during a search of Joshua Clements' house The court heard how Clements stabbed student Audean Thompson, 20, in the stomach and leg. Mr Thompson, who used a walking stick due to a previous leg injury, was left with a 4cm (1.5 inch) stab wound to the chest and had Â£150 taken in the attack. The attack was captured on mobile phone footage which was played in court. Earlier that night, male model Duane Williams, 20, was stabbed in the stomach by Clements, leaving part of his bowel lining protruding. Clements did not attempt to rob Mr Williams. A spontaneous water fight in Hyde Park led to violent clashes in which five officers were injured and one was stabbed Mr Thompson wrote in a statement: ""I worry people will recognise me. I have not been on a bus since."" Mr Williams said he was left fearful about going out and his scars stopped him working as a body model. Judge Michael Topolski QC said: ""These were vicious attacks on two unarmed entirely innocent victims."" The judge sentenced Clements to 14 years in a young offenders institution with an extended licence period of five years.

Bookmaker tops list of MP donations,"MPs have declared about Â£215,000 worth of gifts, benefits and hospitality Sports and betting companies top the list of donors treating MPs to gifts and hospitality. The Ladbrokes Coral group appeared 15 times in the register of members' interests, more than any other donor. Out of 187 donations from UK sources registered by MPs, 58 were from the world of sport. A further 19 were from betting companies. Ladbrokes Coral said it wanted MPs to take decisions ""from a position of knowledge"". But campaigners for tighter rules on gambling said companies could use hospitality to lobby MPs not to change rules on fixed odds betting terminals. MPs declared hospitality from Ladbrokes including tickets to Cheltenham Races MPs are required todeclare any gifts, benefits and hospitality,externalover a value of Â£300. The latest register was published on 29 August and most declarations date from the beginning of 2016 to July 2017. The Ladbrokes Coral Group accounted for 15 entries including trips to Ascot, Doncaster and Cheltenham races, the Community Shield at Wembley and dinner at the Conservative Party conference. Altogether, the group of companies donated Â£7,475-worth of hospitality to four MPs, Conservatives Philip Davies (eight occasions - totalling Â£3,685), Laurence Robertson (four occasions -Â£2,550) and ThÃ©rÃ¨se Coffey (twice - Â£890) and Labour's Conor McGinn (once - Â£350). The total does not include any gifts or hospitality worth less than Â£300 as MPs do not have to declare this. ITV appeared eight times and Channel 4 was mentioned five times. BBC Northern Ireland appears once. While Ladbrokes Coral appeared most often it was not the biggest donor in terms of the value of its hospitality. The largest individual donor in the section on ""gifts, benefits and hospitality from UK sources"" was the Road Haulage Association, which the register revealed funds a researcher in the office of Dover's Conservative MP Charlie Elphicke at a cost of Â£22,577. Mr Elphicke said: ""The researcher is looking at how we can be ready on day one for Brexit - particularly at the Dover front line. ""This is vital work for both my constituency and the haulage industry. No-one wants to see long queues of lorries at Dover. ""In this work the interests of the haulage industry and my constituency are strongly aligned. That's why we decided to join forces."" Matt Zarb-Cousin, spokesman for the Campaign for Fairer Gambling, accused Ladbrokes Coral of being ""desperate"" to keep fixed odds betting terminals (FOBTs) at Â£100 a spin. He said: ""They will throw as much money as they can. It shows a lot about the strength of their argument that they need to wine and dine MPs."" The organisation wants to see the maximum stake on the terminals cut from Â£100 to Â£2 amidconcerns vulnerable peoplecan lose a lot of money very quickly. Its founder Derek Webb has funded the Liberal Democrats and also appeared in previous registers of members' interests as a donor to Labour deputy leader Tom Watson. The government isconducting a reviewinto FOBTs. A spokesman for Ladbrokes Coral said: ""We employ over 25,000 people, we have a high street presence in nearly every constituency in the land and pay UK taxes of circa Â£55m per annum. ""Of course we engage with politicians, we want to make sure that when decisions are taken that affect our 25,000 people, they are done from a position of knowledge."" Mr Davies, MP for Shipley and one of the recipients of Ladbrokes' hospitality, said: ""I am the elected chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group for Betting and Gaming - and a former bookmaker - so of course I meet with bookmakers. ""It would be rather extraordinary if I didn't."" Tewkesbury MP Mr Robertson said he did discuss FOBTs with Ladbrokes, but also other issues such as taxation and their relationship with horse racing. He said: ""Very many companies (including the BBC) provide hospitality as a means of lobbying MPs pretty well every day of the week, inside and outside the Palace of Westminster, at various sporting and other events, at party conferences and so on. ""Charities do similar. Some of it is declarable, if it is over the threshold, and some of it isn't. ""I represent the Cheltenham racecourse and am also joint chairman of the All Party Parliamentary Group on Racing and Bloodstock, so have responsibilities in this area. ""Similar to most countries in the world, UK horse racing is very largely financially supported by bookmakers and there is a fear that curtailing their income by reducing the stakes on FOBTs could cause many shops to close which would, in turn, lead to a dramatic reduction in the funding of horse racing, which, contrary to popular belief, is a very poorly funded sport in the first place."" Dr Coffey and Mr McGinn have been approached for comment.

Immigration detainees 'mocked and abused',"Covert footage was filmed inside Brook House, near Gatwick Airport G4S has suspended nine members of staff from an immigration removal centre near Gatwick Airport, following a BBC Panorama undercover investigation. The programme says it has covert footage recorded at Brook House showing officers ""mocking, abusing and assaulting"" people being held there. It says it has seen ""widespread self-harm and attempted suicides"" in the centre, and that drug use is ""rife"". G4S said it is aware of the claims and ""immediately"" began an investigation. Security giant's chequered record The security firm said it had not been provided with recorded evidence, but added: ""There is no place for the type of conduct described."" Those suspended were one female nurse, six detention custody officers, and two managers, who were all male. Five other members of staff have also been placed on restrictive duties, the BBC understands. A former G4S officer, who now works for the Home Office, has also been suspended. Callum Tulley agreed to the secret filming because he said he was so shocked by the alleged abuse and chaos The programme, to be aired on Monday, uses footage it says was recorded by former custody officer Callum Tulley at the centre, which holds detainees facing deportation from the UK. Panorama says it has seen ""chaos, incompetence and abuse"" at the centre, which it describes as a ""toxic mix"". It claims detainees who are failed asylum seekers can share rooms with foreign national criminals who have finished prison sentences. These criminals, who are awaiting deportation, make up about half of the people in Brook House. Because of the amount of time people are being held for, ""there is a huge amount of frustration being built up,"" BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said. He added the allegations raised ""serious questions"" about the company's capability to manage places like this in the future. G4S said the staff suspensions were a ""precaution"" but it reported the allegations to ""the relevant authorities"". This video can not be played Jerry Petherick said G4S does its ""upmost"" to train staff properly Speaking to BBC Radio 4's World at One, the managing director for G4S's custodial and detention services in the UK said the alleged behaviour was ""abnormal"". Jerry Petherick told the programme: ""It's despicable, it's disgraceful. It's my job to drive the expected behaviours... [and] I take personal accountability and responsibility for doing that."" He said the detainees were ""all vitally important individuals"" and that he wished he had known about the allegations sooner. Mr Petherick confirmed G4S would continue with its bid for the next contract for Brook House. Brook House is operated privately by G4S on behalf of the Home Office But the chairwoman of the all party parliamentary group on refugees said the contract ""should be suspended and reviewed"". Labour MP Thangam Debbonaire told World at One: ""These are people who are not criminals, they are being detained. And the use of detention, unfortunately, over the last few years has, by the Home Office, become a port of first resort rather than last resort as it is supposed to be."" A Home Office spokesman said: ""We condemn any actions that put the safety or dignity of immigration removal centre detainees at risk. ""We are clear that all detainees should be treated with dignity and respect and we expect G4S to carry out a thorough investigation into these allegations and that all appropriate action be taken."" G4S runs Brook House on behalf of the Home Office as well as working in a number of sectors, including technology, care and justice services, and cash transportation. The firm has 585,000 employees across 100 countries worldwide but has alsoattracted controversies and accusations of mismanagement. In 2014, it paid Â£109m for overcharging the Ministry of Justice for tagging offenders, while it also failed to employ enough security for the London 2012 Olympics. Last year, criminal proceedings were launched against eight G4S staff for their treatment of young people at the Medway Secure Training Centre. It holds up to 508 adult male asylum seekers, illegal immigrants and foreign national offenders In 2010 - a year after opening - Brook House was branded ""fundamentally unsafe"". Three years later inspectors said they saw sustained improvement. The most recent report,externalfrom HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, released in March this year, said some detainees had been held for excessive periods due to ""unreasonable delays in immigration decision making"". It described residential units as ""very closely resembling"" prisons, saying problems were ""exacerbated by poor ventilation and unsatisfactory sanitary facilities"". A review of improvements made at the centre will begin on Monday. Brook House is currently home to 508 men - with the highest numbers coming from Pakistan, Albania, Nigeria, Afghanistan and India. According to the Home Office, the majority of those held are failed asylum seekers or illegal immigrants waiting to be deported from the UK on organised charter flights. Other detainees include foreign national offenders awaiting transfers and those who are considered too challenging to manage in less secure centres. Brook House is one of 11 detention removal centres in England, which together took in 28,908 people last year - including 71 children. During the year, 28,661 people left detention - of which 64% were held for less than 29 days, 18% for between 29 days and 2 months, and 11% for between two and four months. Of the 1,848 (6%) remaining, 179 had been in detention for between one and two years, and 29 for two years or longer.

Solar deal to cut social tenants' bills,"Solar panels are to be installed in 800,000 low-income homes across England and Wales over the next five years, as part of a new government scheme. The Dutch firm, Maas Capital, is investing Â£160m in the project. The panels, which will be free to tenants, are expected to cut hundreds of pounds from energy bills, according to the UK firm Solarplicity. The first people to benefit from the scheme include residents of a sheltered retirement home in Ealing, west London. Speaking at the site, International Trade minister Greg Hands said: ""This initial Â£160m capital expenditure programme will deliver massive benefits to some of the UK's poorest households. ""As well as creating 1,000 jobs and delivering cheaper energy bills for up to 800,000 homes, it shows yet another vote of confidence in the UK as a place to invest and do business."" The firm providing the panels, Solarplicity, will work with more than 40 social landlords, including local authorities across England and Wales. It will profit from the payments received under the feed-in tariff scheme and payments for energy from social housing customers. The feed-in tariff scheme,externaloffers guaranteed cash payments to households that produce their own electricity using renewable technologies. It changed in February, adopting different rules and lower tariff rates. Mr Hands also told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that Solarplicity will target military veterans when it recruits staff to install the panels. ""Armed forces veterans are very good at doing this, actually,"" he said. ""They understand how to put the panels on efficiently and well."" Tenants in the North West will be the biggest beneficiaries, with more than 290,000 homes receiving solar panels in towns and cities such as Oldham and Bradford. The North East and Midlands will also see a significant number of homes benefit. Tenants will not pay anything towards the installation of the panels and their energy bills will be reduced by an average of Â£240 per year, according to the Department for International Trade. Will buses be run on coffee in future? How a 'smarter' power system might affect you Julian Bell, leader of Ealing Council, welcomed the scheme, but said its own programme of installing solar panels had been curtailed after the government reduced the feed-in tariffs that offered a return on electricity generated from small-scale energy schemes. ""The business case didn't quite add-up when the government made changes to subsidies and feed-in tariffs for sustainable energy,"" he said. ""We're grateful that private investors are coming here and investing in Ealing and benefitting our residents but the government still needs to do more to move people to sustainable energy and solar power particularly."" Greg Hands says the scheme is a show of confidence for business in the UK The chief executive of Solarplicity, David Elbourne, said the price of solar panels had fallen enough so that government subsidies were no longer essential. ""In the past, the feed-in tariff meant that people who could afford to have solar, benefitted from solar. But now people who can't afford to have solar [can]- we'll put it on the roof for free - and they will get a reduced energy bill."" David Hunter, director of market studies at energy management firm Schneider Electric gave the scheme a cautious welcome. ""Obviously any kind of investment in the transition to low carbon energy supply can be a positive thing and with any of these developments it's always best to consider whether it's best value for money. ""But certainly the idea of upgrading our social housing stock to make it more energy efficient and lower carbon is a worthwhile aim,"" he said. Maas Capital is the equity investment arm of ABN AMRO, which specialises in shipping, oil and gas, and renewable energy. ABN AMRO is 75% owned by the Dutch government.

OAP fined over naked hotel rampage,"Ruth and Robert Fergus had both been drinking before the incident Staff and guests were forced to flee after two ""out of control"" pensioners rampaged through a Highland Perthshire resort hotel, a court heard. Robert Fergus, 72, ran naked with a pair of scissors in the public reception of the MacDonald Loch Rannoch Hotel and smashed a glass pane. His wife Ruth, 69, threatened to shoot a staff member after ""reacting badly"" to the alcohol she consumed earlier. The couple were fined Â£4,100 at Perth Sheriff Court. Mr Fergus, from Troon, was also ordered to pay the hotel Â£800 compensation to cover the cost of the damage from the incident on 4 February. He had admitted behaving in a threatening and abusive manner towards four staff members, wilfully destroying property, and drink driving. Staff and guests were forced to flee the MacDonald Loch Rannoch Hotel Mrs Fergus admitted causing fear or alarm at the hotel by threatening guests and staff with violence. The court heard how Mr Fergus used the scissors to cut communications cables at the hotel reception and was eventually caught drunk at the wheel of his BMW. Fiscal Depute Michael Sweeney said a guest was woken by banging on his door at 01:45 and saw Mrs Fergus, who became abusive, in the hallway. After the guest informed reception, Mr Fergus appeared with no clothes on and began shouting abuse at the staff and guests in the foyer. Mr Sweeney said: ""Both accused were acting as if they were out of control. ""He was observed to have a pair of scissors. ""Mrs Fergus said: 'I'm going to get a gun and shoot you,' at (staff member) Miss Titkova."" ""On seeing the scissors, Miss Titkova shouted at the other staff and guests to run. ""They saw Mr Fergus pick up a sign and smash a glass pane in the door with it."" Mr Fergus then ran through the foyer telling witnesses he would ""slit"" and ""kill"" them. Staff and guests ran from the hotel towards the village of Kinloch Rannoch. Solicitor Ewan Cameron, for Mr Fergus, said: ""He consumed much more alcohol than was sensible. ""He retired to bed but was roused by his wife who said she had been on the receiving end of hostility from hotel staff. ""He reacted disproportionately by going to reception to confront them."" Solicitor Pauline Cullerton, for Mrs Fergus, said her client reacted badly to the alcohol she drank because she had eaten little during the day. Sheriff Gillian Wade told Mr Fergus: ""I don't think I need to tell you it's a very sorry state of affairs. ""I have no doubt you will regret it for the rest of your life.""

Utilities 'to pay for road disruption',"Councils in England would be allowed to charge utility companies by the hour for roadworks which cause significant disruption, if government proposals are approved. The plan aims to halve the delays motorists endure due to utility works. Roadworks cost the economy Â£4bn a year due to delayed deliveries and people being unable to get to work on time. The proposals follow successful trials in London and Kent which saw severe congestion fall by more than 50%. The charges aim to encourage utility companies to avoid busy routes and times, and to work together to avoid repeatedly digging up the same piece of road. The London trial saw firms co-ordinate their roadworks more than 600 times. Companies could avoid the charges, also known as lane rental schemes, by carrying out works in the evening or at weekends. Councils currently issue permits for roadworks, but the government believes the new scheme would give them greater control and monitoring powers. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling said: ""Delays caused by roadworks can be the bane of drivers' lives - especially when they take place at rush hour on busy routes. ""These proposals would give councils greater powers to ensure utility companies avoid carrying out works at the busiest times and on the most popular routes. ""This would not only improve journeys and cut congestion but also save businesses from the increased costs they incur as a result of traffic on our roads,"" Mr Grayling said. The rollout is part of a government plan to give councils more ways to manage roadworks, with the aim to support the delivery of wider national infrastructure projects. Bob Gallienne, chief executive of the National Joint Utilities Group (NJUG), criticised the proposals, saying: ""Utilities companies are delivering the infrastructure that the UK needs to drive up productivity, create economic growth and deliver on government priorities such as broadband and new homes. ""Lane rental schemes make it harder for utilities companies to deliver vital infrastructure and value for money for consumers while minimising disruption."" 'Keep traffic moving' The Local Government Association (LGA) said it was ""delighted"" that the government hadanswered its callsfor such powers. LGA transport spokesman Martin Tett said: ""Councils are on the side of frustrated motorists who find themselves spending wasted hours held up in tailbacks. ""We're confident these new measures will help minimise delays from roadworks, and keep traffic moving on our local roads. ""It is crucial that councils are given these powers without lengthy national approval mechanisms, so they can ensure critical roadworks are carried out as quickly as possible. ""The sooner councils are allowed to get on top of this problem the better."" AA president Edmund King said lane rental was a ""positive step"". ""We hope that collaboration and cooperative work plans between service providers will now be standard practice,"" he said. ""One issue that we hope is resolved with lane rental is making sure that whoever digs up the road returns it back in a good state. ""It wouldn't be acceptable for the road to be patched up quickly and poorly, just to try and keep within their rental period."" Speaking toBBC Breakfast, Lord Callanan, parliamentary under-secretary of state for the Department for Transport, said that local authorities will inspect the work and ""there's been no evidence of any shoddy workmanship"" in the trials so far. He said: ""The idea is that hopefully at the end of the day we won't be raising much money through this, because they will do the work faster or at quiet times. ""But any money that is raised will have to go back to the local authorities and be spent on other measures to reduce congestion."" The consultation on the proposals will last for eight weeks and the changes would come into effect by 2019.

Hunt protests and sexual grooming,"The National Trust is ""embroiled in a row with countryside campaigners"",according to the lead in the Daily Telegraph,external. The conservation charity has been accused of ""effectively painting targets"" on people who hunt after it decided to publish details of the times and locations of legal hunts on its land. Hunt supporters say such information could be used by saboteurs, increasing the risk of violent disruption. The trust is due to vote at its AGM next month on whether to ban the sport on its land in a motion tabled by the League Against Cruel Sports. It tells the paper it had lost confidence everything possible was being done to ensure the law on hunting was being upheld. The Sun accuses Labour of ""betrayal"",externalover Brexit. ""Labour is now the anti-Brexit party"", it says, after deputy leader Tom Watson said the UK could remain a permanent part of the single market and customs union. The Daily Express agrees,external, saying any effort to keep Britain within the bloc following Brexit would be ""shamefully undemocratic"". TheDaily Mail,externalaccuses Labour of a ""risible volte-face"" - for soft Brexit read no Brexit at all, it says. TheFinancial Times,externalsays a ruling by Kenya's Supreme Court to nullify the presidential election will go some way to restoring faith in the country's democracy. Alex Vines, head of the Africa programme at the Chatham House think tank,tells the Guardian it is good news for Kenya,externalbut says there is no precedent for such a judgement anywhere on the continent.

Would you take a ride in a pilotless sky taxi?,"Dubai says it will begin a five-year test period of the Volocopter later in 2017 Tech companies are competing to develop the first viable passenger-carrying sky taxis, whether manned or pilotless, but how soon could these clever copters really be whizzing over our cities? And would you trust one? Dubai is racing to be the first to put drone taxis in the air. In June, its Roads and Transport Authority (RTA) signed an agreement with a German start-up Volocopter to test pilotless air taxis towards the end of this year. The firm has received 25m euros (Â£22m; $30m) from investors, including German motor manufacturer Daimler, to develop the 18-rotor craft capable of transporting two passengers at a time. The promotional video claims a top speed of 100km/h (60mph) and a maximum flight time of around 30 minutes, while nine independent battery systems ensure safety. ""You will never require"" the onboard emergency parachute, Volocopter assures us. Dubai's RTA has also teamed up with China's Ehang and is testing the drone maker's single passenger Ehang 184 ""autonomous aerial vehicle"". The Ehang 184 will land automatically if any systems malfunction, its maker says Ehang envisages single-click operation via a simple control panel But the largest city in the United Arab Emirates faces stiff competition. It seems the whole world has gone gaga for air-cabs. In February, ride-sharing giant Uber poached Nasa chief technologist Mark Moore and set him to work heading their Project Elevate - ""a future of on-demand urban air transportation"". Airbus, the French aircraft maker, is also working on a prototype air taxi, Vahana, saying it will begin testing at the end of 2017 and have one ready by 2020. They all spy opportunities in the air because traffic is becoming increasingly clogged on the ground. To take an extreme example, in Brazil's Sao Paulo, the world's 10th richest city, traffic jams average 180km (112 miles) on Fridays, and sometimes stretch to a barely credible 295km. Yet the world's megalopolises are continuing to grow. No wonder air taxis are capturing people's imaginations. The Airbus Vahana drone concept features rotors that can swivel for vertical and horizontal flight Ehang carries a single passenger, Volocopter two, while City Airbus is looking at four to six. And each of these companies is pursuing electric propulsion, seeing it as greener and quieter. The preferred horizontal rotor technology allows for vertical take off and landing, which makes sense in densely built up urban spaces. And composite materials, such as carbon fibre, help keep weight to a minimum. But how will they work in practice and will they be affordable? Uber's Mr Moore says the cost, with three or four passengers sharing a pool, will be ""very similar to what an UberX [car] costs today"". More seriously, given the trade-off between power and weight, how long will these things be able to stay up in the sky relying on battery power alone? Because if you don't like your mobile going flat, you definitely won't like it when your air taxi does. With traffic jams like this in Sao Paulo, Brazil, it's no wonder sky taxis are an appealing concept China's Ehang drone currently flies for 23 minutes. But US Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) regulates stipulate that aircraft require a spare 20 minutes of fuel.  So this would limit the drone to a commercially unviable three-minute flight. ""It's really a problem,"" says Janina Frankel-Yoeli vice-president of Israel's Urban Aeronautics, a firm taking a manned, combustion-engine approach to air taxis instead. But Mr Moore argues that improvements in batteries are ""on the track we need for them to be there in 2023"", when Uber plans to have its first 50 air taxis ready. The vastly increased investment in electric cars around the world is improving recharging speeds and capacity, he says. ""We don't need long range - 60 miles covers the longest trip across a city."" So rapid recharging capability is more important than range, he argues. Airbus concept: Is it a car? Is it a plane? Could it be both? Another solution may involve a two-part drone, with the batteries stored in a detachable base that can be swapped quickly between flights, says Tim Robinson, editor of the Royal Aeronautical Society's magazine, Aerospace. ""If there was a drone waiting and it had a flat battery I'm pretty sure it wouldn't let you take off, whatever your journey was,"" he says. In other words, it's very unlikely that a sky taxi would run out of juice mid-flight. Once battery levels reached a critical point, the drone would make an emergency landing. ""I think we'll see multiple redundancy and back-up systems,"" says Mr Robinson, ""like a ballistic parachute which would trigger automatically if it detected a descent rate beyond the parameters."" Another major challenge is managing the airspace and avoiding collisions. Most major cities already have air corridors set up for helicopters that air taxis could use, Mr Moore says. But requesting to enter the corridors is currently done manually. Is 'killer robot' warfare closer than we think? How your digital self could 'live' on after you die Is 'tap and go' a better way to give to charity? Can hi-res music hit the right note? ""You'd fly to the edge of that airspace, request to enter, and maybe be told 'Nope, hold, wait',"" he says. So Nasa's NTX research centre is exploring how flight corridors can work without voice interactions. This includes improved ""sense-and-avoid"" technology that will allow drones to communicate with other passenger aircraft to avoid one other. But perhaps the biggest drag on sky taxi development is regulation. While commercial aircraft are already ""virtually capable of taking off, flying and landing on their own"", says Ms Frankel-Yoeli, the US FAA and European Aviation Safety Agency will not allow them to fly without a pilot. It may take a long time for autonomous drone tech to win regulatory - not to mention public - trust. And that's ignoring the potential complaints about the noise all these buzzing copters would make in our cities. Uber's Mr Moore believes air taxis will have autonomous capability built in from 2023, but will have human pilots for the first five-to-10 years while enough data is collected to convince regulators that sky taxis are safe. Meanwhile Dubai seems to be racing ahead, with ruler Sheikh Mohammed bin Rashid Al Maktoum saying ""by 2030, 25% of the mass transportation in the city has to be autonomous"". But Dubai is a harsh aviation climate, where ""winds can go up to 40-50 knots [46-58mph], there's sand, there's fog"", warns Mark Martin, an aviation consultant working there. Perhaps Dubai is moving too quickly and should work more closely with the slower US and European regulators, he argues. ""If one crashes, who's ever going to take a drone?""

Has voodoo been misjudged?,"The Temple of Pythons in Benin is considered a sacred place by voodoo followers While many African traditions and cultures are under threat from modern life, there is one which is holding its own - voodoo. It has suffered from a bad press internationally but is an official religion in the West African country of Benin. In the voodoo heartland of Ouidah, the sound of drums fills the air, while men and women dressed mainly in white take turns to dance around a bowl of millet, a freshly slaughtered chicken and alcohol. These are the day's offering at the Temple of Pythons. They have an audience of about 60 people who have gathered from nearby towns for an annual cleansing ceremony. Inside the temple, where more than 50 snakes are slithering around a custom-made pit, local devotees make amends for sins of the past year. In voodoo, the python is a symbol of strength - the devotees explain they are relying on Dagbe, the spirit whose temple this is, to give them the power to change. And to make that change happen, blood must be spilled. Animal sacrifices are an important part of voodoo ceremonies - an offering to appease the spirits The first offering is a chicken - some of the blood is spread across the tiles of the temple and the rest is mixed into a communal bowl of millet - which the devotees eat as it is passed around. Voodoo is rooted in the worship of nature and ancestors - and the belief that the living and the dead exist side by side - a dual world that can be accessed through various deities. Its followers believe in striving to live in peace and to always do good - that bad intentions will not go unpunished, a similar concept to Christians striving for ""righteousness"" and not ""sinning"". Voodoo believers communicate with their gods through prayers and meditation Modest estimates put voodoo followers here at at least 40% of Benin's population. Some 27% classify themselves as Christians and 22% Muslims. But expert on African religions and traditions Dodji Amouzouvi, a professor of sociology and anthropology, says many people practice ""dual religion"". ""There is a popular saying here: 'Christian during the day and voodoo at night'. It simply means that even those who follow other faiths always return to voodoo in some way,"" he tells me. To illustrate the closeness of the two faiths, there is a Basilica opposite the Temple of Pythons in the town square. ""At the moment many people here in Benin feel let down by the establishment, there are no jobs,"" Mr Amouzouvi. ""People are turning to voodoo to pray for better times."" But how did voodoo get exported to places such as New Orleans and Haiti? At the edge of the sea in Ouidah stands La Porte du Non-Retour ""The Door of No Return"" - a stone arch monument with carvings of men and women in chains walking in a procession towards a ship. The Door of No Return is a reminder of Benin's painful slave history It was from this point that many thousands of African slaves were packed into ships and taken to the Americas - the only thing they took with them was voodoo, which they clung to as a reminder of home. They continued to practise it, at times being beaten if caught by the slave masters. This made some even more determined to keep it alive, according to reports. Some practices in voodoo can appear threatening to the outsider - the slaughtering of animals have in part earned the faith its unflattering image, some say. But Mr Amouzouvi says voodoo is not all that different to other faiths. ""Many religions recognise blood as a source of power, a sign of life. In Christianity it's taught that there is power in the blood of Jesus,"" he says. ""Voodoo teaches that there is power in blood, it can appease gods, give thanks. Animals are seen as an important part of the voodoo practice."" Regine Romaine, an academic with a keen interest in voodoo, agrees. ""The African experience is open for all to see - people are invited to witness the ceremonies, the slaughtering and that same openness has been judged whereas it isn't in other systems like the Islamic and Jewish faiths,"" she tells me. ""Slaughtering animals is not unique to voodoo. If you go to the kosher deli or buy halaal meat, it's been killed and allowed to bleed out before being shared. ""Ultimately, the gaze on voodoo over the years has not been one of love - that's why it's been given a bad image."" Ms Romaine is of Haitian and US heritage. She first learned about voodoo from her aunt in Haiti - she travelled on a pilgrimage to retrace the ""slave route"" and her last stop was here in Benin where she has been living for more than a year. According to Ms Romaine, voodoo's bad image abroad has a lot to do with what people have seen in Hollywood films. ""The image of voodoo went wrong from the first encounter - from the first visitors to the continent, the anthropologists who didn't understand what they were seeing and from that came a lot of xenophobic writing,"" she says. ""It was also worsened by the US invasion of Haiti much later, which gave rise to Hollywood's fascination with the horror stories that all had voodoo."" Back at the ceremony, the processing of devotees has now moved to the town square for the final stage of the rituals. There is more drumming, singing, dancing and after four animals are killed and cooked inside three large flaming pots of clay, the meat inside is shared by all those who have attended the day's proceedings. The Regional High Priest of Voodoo Daagbo Hounon is presiding over the day's rituals. He is dressed in ceremonial robes, with a striking top hat, and holding a staff made from cowry shells. Regional High Priest of Voodoo Daagbo Hounon says voodoo has been unfairly judged by outsiders over the years He is a big man with a booming voice and speaks passionately about their belief system - he tells me that their faith is misunderstood. ""Voodoo is not evil. It's not the devil,"" he says. ""If you believe and someone thinks badly of you and tries to harm to you, voodoo will protect you. Some say it is the devil, we don't believe in the devil and even if he exists, he's not here,"" he tells me. He is keen to welcome international visitors. The small town offers an ""initiation"" from people from all over the world to come and learn about the practice - from how to use herbal medication, how to pray and meditate, how to perform rituals for the gods. High Priest Hounon says the programme is popular with tourists from the US, Cuba and parts of Europe. For many West Africans in the diaspora, voodoo has become a symbolic coming home. Ceremonies are a chance for young and old to come together and celebrate Ms Romaine, who is also member of that diaspora, believes voodoo is successful because it provides a connection to a neglected identity. She tells me that voodoo is gaining appeal in the US amongst young people. ""There is a shift especially in the Americas. The younger generation now want to proclaim their identity in a way that the previous generation was perhaps more intimidated to do and spiritual identity is a part of that. For some voodoo meets that need."" The government here in Benin is committed to upholding the practice. In the mid 1990s it built a monument to voodoo in a place known as the sacred forest - an ancient place of worship on the edge of town. Life-sized metal and wooden totems have pride of place amongst the towering trees - this place is meant to help teach young people here about their voodoo heritage. With the government supporting it at home and the descendants of slaves embracing it abroad, the ancient voodoo tradition has found a place in the modern world, where other African belief systems are often struggling for relevance.

Man murdered niece who was also partner,"The court heard Christopher Wall, 58, was in a relationship with his niece Hayley, 25 A man has been jailed for life for murdering a woman who was his niece and also his partner. Hayley Wall, 25, was found with head injuries in a street in Bournemouth on 13 December and died nine days later. A jury heard evidence suggesting she had been struck by a television and possibly also a door ripped from its hinges. Christopher Wall, 58, of Shelbourne Road, was convicted by a jury on Thursday following a two-week trial. Hayley Wall was found with serious injuries outside Charminster Supermarket in Bournemouth Jailing Wall for a minimum of 14 years, Judge Keith Cutler told him: ""You felt you were in love. This all happened because your relationship was volatile, sometimes marked by violence and aggression."" The judge said neighbours had heard Wall shouting, ""is this how you want to be treated?"", followed by repeated thuds. Passers-by found Hayley with serious injuries in Charminster Road before she was taken to hospital. The court heard that before falling unconscious, she told a paramedic: ""My partner smashed a TV over the top of my head."" Later on the same evening, police found Wall asleep in bed with stab wounds to his back. He told detectives he had been attacked by Hayley with a pair of scissors and had used reasonable force to defend himself. Police found a damaged flat screen television in the house, as well as blood in the bedroom and bathroom. A blood-stained door on a landing had been knocked off its frame and had two long dark hairs embedded in a crack. Wall's barrister, Nicholas Haggan QC, told the court: ""He is desperately sorry that Hayley died as a result of events that night. All he can do is apologise."" In a statement, Hayley's relatives said they would have acted to get her away from Wall if they had known about their relationship.

Fox issues Brexit 'blackmail' warning,"This video can not be played Liam Fox says negotiations should focus on the final Brexit settlement The UK must not be ""blackmailed"" into agreeing a Brexit ""divorce"" bill before trade talks begin, Liam Fox has said. Talks should begin soon ""because that's good for business"", the international trade secretary added. EU negotiator Michel Barnier has said trade talks are still a way off, due to slow progress on other key issues. The UK Brexit Secretary, David Davis, has warned that negotiations will be turbulent and disagreements over the divorce bill were ""the first ripple"". Concluding the third round of Brexit negotiations on Thursday, both he and Mr Barniermade clearthat the size of the UK's Brexit ""divorce bill"" remained a sticking point in talks. The UK wants to begin trade talks and discuss the future relationship between Britain and the EU as soon as possible, saying it would benefit both sides. Brexit: What is at stake in EU-UK talks? Reality check: Why it's all about money Brexit: All you need to know At-a-glance guide to Brexit negotiations However, Brussels insists that discussions about the future relationship can only begin once ""sufficient progress"" has been made on the ""divorce bill"" - the amount the UK will pay to settle its liabilities when it leaves the EU -  citizens' rights, and the border between Northern Ireland and the Irish republic. Speaking in Japan on Friday, Mr Fox was asked whether it was time for the UK to name its Brexit price. He told ITV News: ""We can't be blackmailed into paying a price on the first part (the divorce fee). Analysis by BBC political correspondent Iain Watson Liam Fox undertook a range of broadcast interviews before flying back from Japan. His accusation of ""blackmail"" featured only in the first of these. That suggests this wasn't a pre-scripted broadside. Instead, it perhaps demonstrated frustration that, so far, the government's strategy of pushing for wider trade talks with the EU in the autumn hasn't been successful. The aim was to persuade big EU trading nations to put pressure on the EU Commission to start trade talks after the October EU summit but it seems that the end of the year now looks a more likely timescale. His colleague David Davis - a self-declared ""determined optimist"" - thinks that there could be more progress after German elections later this month. Interestingly, he declined to repeat or endorse the international trade secretary's rather undiplomatic language - simply warning of more turbulence to come. ""We think we should begin discussions on the final settlement because that's good for business, and it's good for the prosperity both of the British people and of the rest of the people of the European Union."" Speaking to the BBC at the end of the three-day visit to Japan, Mr Fox said businesses were ""getting impatient"" and a willingness by the EU to negotiate on the future trading relationship now would ""unlock some of the tension"". Reality Check: Will EHIC work after Brexit? When asked about Mr Fox's ""blackmail"" remark, Mr Davis, who has been giving a speech in Washington DC, said he did not comment on other ministers' views. But he added: ""We are in a very difficult and tough, complicated negotiation. I have said from the beginning it will be turbulent. What we are having at the moment is the first ripple and there will be many more ripples along the way."" Britain, which voted to leave the EU in June 2016, officially began Brexit talks on 19 June this year and is due to leave the EU on Friday, 29 March 2019. Mr Barnier said that at the current rate of progress, he was quite far from being able to recommend opening parallel talks on a future trade relationship. No figure has yet been put on the ""divorce"" payment, but European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has suggested it could come in at about 60bn euros (Â£55bn). This video can not be played David Davis, Brexit secretary: ""I think it's fair to say we've seen some concrete progress"" This video can not be played Michel Barnier, EU's chief Brexit negotiator: UK's requests are ""simply impossible"" Writing in theDaily Telegraph,externalon Friday, Belgian MEP Guy Verhofstadt, who heads the European Parliament's Brexit group, said the EU has been ""fully transparent"" about its negotiating positions and mandates since day one. ""This is not a ploy to derail talks, but an inevitable consequence of the Brexit decision,"" he said. Labour MP Chuka Umunna, who works with the pro-EU Open Britain pressure group, said Mr Fox's comments were ""sabre rattling from a trade secretary who is twiddling his thumbs because he cannot do anything until the trade position of the UK has been resolved with the EU"". The European Council is due to meet in October and will decide whether sufficient progress has been made on key Brexit discussions to allow negotiations to move on to trade and the UK's future relationship with the EU. If it has not, as Mr Barnier has suggested, the next opportunity would be the council's meeting in December - meaning talks about the future relationship would be unlikely to begin before the end of the year. Meanwhile the Home Office has told EU citizens in the UK, and UK expats in the EU, that ""progress was made"" in this week's negotiations on rights to healthcare, and the right of EU citizens to set up and manage a business. The update said: ""We agreed to protect the rights to reciprocal healthcare, including European Health Insurance Cards (EHICs), for EU citizens in the UK and UK nationals in the EU who are present on the day of exit. ""Both sides also agreed that the rights of cross border workers should be protected. ""On economic rights, we have confirmed the right of EU citizens to set up and manage a business in the UK, and the same applies to British citizens in their member state of residence,"" the Home Office added. It also said it had apologised to about 100 EU citizens who received deportation letters ""in error"" and said the letters should be ignored.

G4S immigration removal staff suspended,"Covert footage was filmed inside Brook House, near Gatwick Airport G4S has suspended nine members of staff from an immigration removal centre near Gatwick Airport, following a BBC Panorama undercover investigation. The programme says it has covert footage recorded at Brook House showing officers ""mocking, abusing and assaulting"" people being held there. It says it has seen ""widespread self-harm and attempted suicides"" in the centre, and that drug use is ""rife"". G4S said it is aware of the claims and ""immediately"" began an investigation. Security giant's chequered record The security firm said it had not been provided with recorded evidence, but added: ""There is no place for the type of conduct described."" Those suspended were one female nurse, six detention custody officers, and two managers, who were all male. Five other members of staff have also been placed on restrictive duties, the BBC understands. A former G4S officer, who now works for the Home Office, has also been suspended. Callum Tulley agreed to the secret filming because he said he was so shocked by the alleged abuse and chaos The programme, to be aired on Monday, uses footage it says was recorded by former custody officer Callum Tulley at the centre, which holds detainees facing deportation from the UK. Panorama says it has seen ""chaos, incompetence and abuse"" at the centre, which it describes as a ""toxic mix"". It claims detainees who are failed asylum seekers can share rooms with foreign national criminals who have finished prison sentences. These criminals, who are awaiting deportation, make up about half of the people in Brook House. Because of the amount of time people are being held for, ""there is a huge amount of frustration being built up,"" BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said. He added the allegations raised ""serious questions"" about the company's capability to manage places like this in the future. G4S said the staff suspensions were a ""precaution"" but it reported the allegations to ""the relevant authorities"". This video can not be played Jerry Petherick said G4S does its ""upmost"" to train staff properly Speaking to BBC Radio 4's World at One, the managing director for G4S's custodial and detention services in the UK said the alleged behaviour was ""abnormal"". Jerry Petherick told the programme: ""It's despicable, it's disgraceful. It's my job to drive the expected behaviours... [and] I take personal accountability and responsibility for doing that."" He said the detainees were ""all vitally important individuals"" and that he wished he had known about the allegations sooner. Mr Petherick confirmed G4S would continue with its bid for the next contract for Brook House. Brook House is operated privately by G4S on behalf of the Home Office But the chairwoman of the all party parliamentary group on refugees said the contract ""should be suspended and reviewed"". Labour MP Thangam Debbonaire told World at One: ""These are people who are not criminals, they are being detained. And the use of detention, unfortunately, over the last few years has, by the Home Office, become a port of first resort rather than last resort as it is supposed to be."" A Home Office spokesman said: ""We condemn any actions that put the safety or dignity of immigration removal centre detainees at risk. ""We are clear that all detainees should be treated with dignity and respect and we expect G4S to carry out a thorough investigation into these allegations and that all appropriate action be taken."" G4S runs Brook House on behalf of the Home Office as well as working in a number of sectors, including technology, care and justice services, and cash transportation. The firm has 585,000 employees across 100 countries worldwide but has alsoattracted controversies and accusations of mismanagement. In 2014, it paid Â£109m for overcharging the Ministry of Justice for tagging offenders, while it also failed to employ enough security for the London 2012 Olympics. Last year, criminal proceedings were launched against eight G4S staff for their treatment of young people at the Medway Secure Training Centre. It holds up to 508 adult male asylum seekers, illegal immigrants and foreign national offenders In 2010 - a year after opening - Brook House was branded ""fundamentally unsafe"". Three years later inspectors said they saw sustained improvement. The most recent report,externalfrom HM Chief Inspector of Prisons, released in March this year, said some detainees had been held for excessive periods due to ""unreasonable delays in immigration decision making"". It described residential units as ""very closely resembling"" prisons, saying problems were ""exacerbated by poor ventilation and unsatisfactory sanitary facilities"". A review of improvements made at the centre will begin on Monday. Brook House is currently home to 508 men - with the highest numbers coming from Pakistan, Albania, Nigeria, Afghanistan and India. According to the Home Office, the majority of those held are failed asylum seekers or illegal immigrants waiting to be deported from the UK on organised charter flights. Other detainees include foreign national offenders awaiting transfers and those who are considered too challenging to manage in less secure centres. Brook House is one of 11 detention removal centres in England, which together took in 28,908 people last year - including 71 children. During the year, 28,661 people left detention - of which 64% were held for less than 29 days, 18% for between 29 days and 2 months, and 11% for between two and four months. Of the 1,848 (6%) remaining, 179 had been in detention for between one and two years, and 29 for two years or longer.

OAP couple fined for hotel rampage,"Ruth and Robert Fergus had both been drinking before the incident Staff and guests were forced to flee after two ""out of control"" pensioners rampaged through a Highland Perthshire resort hotel, a court heard. Robert Fergus, 72, ran naked with a pair of scissors in the public reception of the MacDonald Loch Rannoch Hotel and smashed a glass pane. His wife Ruth, 69, threatened to shoot a staff member after ""reacting badly"" to the alcohol she consumed earlier. The couple were fined Â£4,100 at Perth Sheriff Court. Mr Fergus, from Troon, was also ordered to pay the hotel Â£800 compensation to cover the cost of the damage from the incident on 4 February. He had admitted behaving in a threatening and abusive manner towards four staff members, wilfully destroying property, and drink driving. Staff and guests were forced to flee the MacDonald Loch Rannoch Hotel Mrs Fergus admitted causing fear or alarm at the hotel by threatening guests and staff with violence. The court heard how Mr Fergus used the scissors to cut communications cables at the hotel reception and was eventually caught drunk at the wheel of his BMW. Fiscal Depute Michael Sweeney said a guest was woken by banging on his door at 01:45 and saw Mrs Fergus, who became abusive, in the hallway. After the guest informed reception, Mr Fergus appeared with no clothes on and began shouting abuse at the staff and guests in the foyer. Mr Sweeney said: ""Both accused were acting as if they were out of control. ""He was observed to have a pair of scissors. ""Mrs Fergus said: 'I'm going to get a gun and shoot you,' at (staff member) Miss Titkova."" ""On seeing the scissors, Miss Titkova shouted at the other staff and guests to run. ""They saw Mr Fergus pick up a sign and smash a glass pane in the door with it."" Mr Fergus then ran through the foyer telling witnesses he would ""slit"" and ""kill"" them. Staff and guests ran from the hotel towards the village of Kinloch Rannoch. Solicitor Ewan Cameron, for Mr Fergus, said: ""He consumed much more alcohol than was sensible. ""He retired to bed but was roused by his wife who said she had been on the receiving end of hostility from hotel staff. ""He reacted disproportionately by going to reception to confront them."" Solicitor Pauline Cullerton, for Mrs Fergus, said her client reacted badly to the alcohol she drank because she had eaten little during the day. Sheriff Gillian Wade told Mr Fergus: ""I don't think I need to tell you it's a very sorry state of affairs. ""I have no doubt you will regret it for the rest of your life.""

Man guilty of Andy Carroll robbery bid,"This video can not be played Footage of the chase was captured on a dashcam and bus CCTV cameras A man has been jailed for trying to rob footballer Andy Carroll of his Â£22,000 wristwatch as the striker drove home from West Ham's training ground. Jack O'Brien, 22, claimed he was not the motorbike rider who targeted Mr Carroll as he waited at traffic lights in north-east London, on 2 November. Mr Carroll told Basildon Crown Court he believed O'Brien had a gun. O'Brien, of Navarre Gardens, Romford, was given six years, with another five years three months for other crimes. The sentences are to run consecutively. He had pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to several other robberies, carried out in October and November, last year. Jack O'Brien was found by police hiding beneath a mattress O'Brien was found by police hiding beneath a mattress in a property in Dagenham 10 days after the attempt. The footballer told jurors he was scared when the motorcycle rider pulled up beside him, said ""nice watch"" then demanded he gave it to him. Mr Carroll did a U-turn, but was forced to drive on the wrong side of the road as he was pursued back to West Ham's training ground where there were security staff. In a 999 call played in court he was heard telling responders: ""There's two motorbikes, one's behind me pulling out a gun, I don't know what to do."" Mr Carroll also said he had ""probably just hit about 10 cars"" during his getaway. In a victim impact statement Mr Carroll said he had ""feared for his life"" and now travels to and from training with security guards. The West Ham striker told the court he now travels to and from training with security guards Police seized a motorcycle helmet, Ducati jacket and a Suzuki motorbike which they believed were used by O'Brien during the attempted robbery. DNA matching the 22-year-old's was found on the helmet and jacket, but O'Brien said that while he had used the equipment for other robberies, somebody else was wearing them when Mr Carroll was targeted. No firearm was found by police. The second motorbike rider has not been located. Judge John Lodge suggested O'Brien had targeted Mr Carroll, telling the court it ""doesn't take an awful lot of work"" to find out when the striker would leave training and by what route. Det Sgt Brett Hagen said CCTV footage of the pursuit ""shows the persistent and reckless lengths this man went to in order to try to steal a high-value watch"". ""I would like to thank the victim who showed great courage and calmness throughout this terrifying robbery attempt,"" he continued. Andy Carroll chase caught on video.

Sales of inefficient vacuum cleaners banned,"Sales of vacuum cleaners producing more noise and heat than suction are restricted under EU rules from today. Vacuum cleaners using more than 900 watts and emitting more than 80 decibels will be banned when stocks run out. Some anti-EU campaigners say homes won't be properly cleaned if people have to buy lower wattage machines. But energy experts say the best low-power appliances clean just as well as high-wattage machines. They say some manufacturers deliberately increased the amount of electricity their appliances use because shoppers equate high-wattage with high performance. The European Environment Bureau (EEB) said: ""Power doesn't always equal performance, though the misconception has become widespread. ""Some efficient models maintained high standards of dust pick-up while using significantly less energy - due to design innovation."" Vacuum cleaner salesman Howard Johnson, who works in Coventry, told BBC News: ""People want a more powerful vacuum cleaner but they can't see that more power doesn't mean more suction. ""The lower power machines are perfectly adequate, and better for the planet"". Less power doesn't have to mean less suction, say experts The EU's own website says: ""With more efficient vacuum cleaners, Europe as a whole can save up to 20 TWh of electricity per year by 2020. ""This is equivalent to the annual household electricity consumption of Belgium. ""It also means over 6 million tonnes of CO2 will not be emitted - about the annual emissions of eight medium-sized power plants."" And the UK Climate Change Committee says that since 2008 electricity demand is down 17% (despite all our gadgets) and gas demand is 23% lower, thanks to tougher standards on energy efficiency in homes and appliances. This, it says, has helped keep bills down. But there's a question over what happens to EU energy standards after Brexit. UKIP's Roger Helmer said: ""By all means let's make pathetic under-powered vacuum cleaners for export to the EU. ""But we must retain the right to make and use sensible full-powered appliances in the UK. This shows why we must not agree to be bound by EU rules after Brexit."" The EEB replied: ""Without EU energy efficiency rules, the UK market risks getting flooded with inefficient and cheap imports from China which waste more energy and break easily due to lower standards."" Efficiency standards are so effective at driving down bills and emissions that it's believed they will be kept after Brexit. But the government's statement to BBC News on the issue was ambiguous. A spokeswoman said: ""Until we leave the EU, the UK government continues to implement European regulations. ""We support measures that will save households and businesses money on their energy bills."" Sir James Dyson has gone to court over the issue Vacuum cleaner entrepreneur Sir James Dyson has been in a court battle with the EU because he says the vacuum standards test doesn't replicate real world conditions. His spokesman told BBC News: ""We agree with the principle of using standards to drive products that use less energy. ""But we think that technical innovation itself would be a better way of changing consumer behaviour. ""You can have a perfectly good vacuum cleaner running with lower energy."" The latest Dyson model does qualify under the new EU rules. Next week the government will be presented with a major report from energy economists making the case for a big boost to the economy through energy efficiency in homes.

Court annuls Kenya presidential election,"This video can not be played A Kenyan opposition stronghold celebrates the decision Kenya's Supreme Court has annulled the result of last month's presidential election, citing irregularities, and ordered a new one within 60 days. The election commission had declared incumbent Uhuru Kenyatta the winner by a margin of 1.4 million votes. Raila Odinga, Mr Kenyatta's opponent, said the commission was ""rotten"" and demanded resignations and prosecutions. President Kenyatta said he would respect the court's decision but also branded the judges ""crooks"". Other elections in Africa have been annulled or cancelled but this appears to be the first time on the continent that an opposition court challenge against a presidential poll result has been successful. What next for Kenya after void election? The brave judge who made Kenyan history Friday's events as they happened Chief Justice David Maraga said the 8 August election had not been ""conducted in accordance with the constitution"" and declared it ""invalid, null and void"". He said the verdict was backed by four of the six Supreme Court judges. The announcement drew cheers from opposition supporters both inside and outside the courtroom. The court ruling did not attribute any blame to President Kenyatta's party or campaign. Justice Maraga said the election commission had failed ""to conduct the presidential election in a manner consistent with the dictates of the constitution"". This video can not be played Justice Maraga declares the election ""invalid, null and void"" He said the commission had committed irregularities ""in the transmission of results"", adding that the court would provide details in a full judgment within 21 days. Dissenting judges said that the Nasa opposition alliance - which had petitioned the Supreme Court - failed to prove claims that the polls had been rigged. The election sparked days of sporadic protests, in which at least 28 people were killed. The vote had raised fears of major political violence - as was the case after a disputed poll in 2007. Mr Odinga, 72, said the ruling marked ""a historic day for the people of Kenya and by extension for the people of the continent of Africa"". He said: ""It is now clear that the entire [electoral commission] is rotten. ""It is clear that the real election results were never shared with Kenyans. Someone must take responsibility."" Raila Odinga (C) reacts with delight in the courtroom Mr Odinga added: ""We won the elections and we are going to win them again."" President Kenyatta, in a televised address, said that it was ""important to respect the rule of law even if you disagree with the Supreme Court ruling"". Uhuru Kenyatta: Kenya's 'digital president' Raila Odinga - the man Kenyans either love or loathe He called for calm, saying: ""Your neighbour will still be your neighbour, regardless of what has happened... My primary message today to every single Kenyan is peace. Let us be people of peace."" Uhuru Kenyatta, in power since 2013, won a second term at last month's poll, which has now been declared invalid Mr Kenyatta, 55, added: ""We are ready to go back again to the people with the same agenda that we delivered to the people."" The president was more combative later at a rally of supporters in a market in Nairobi. He referred to Justice Maraga and his fellow judges as wakora (crooks in Swahili), saying they had ""decided to cancel the election"". He warned the chief justice that as the poll had been annulled he was now the president again, not president-elect. ""Do you understand me? Maraga should know that he is now dealing with the serving president,"" Mr Kenyatta said. ""We are keeping a close eye on them. But let us deal with the election first. We are not afraid."" Chairman Wafula Chebukati noted the ruling and said there would be ""changes to personnel"" ahead of the new election. He invited the director of public prosecutions ""to prosecute any of our staff that may have been involved in violations"". But he ruled out resigning, saying he had not been accused of wrongdoing. After the election, international monitors from the EU, the African Union and the US had said there was no major fraud on polling day and urged Mr Odinga to concede. On Friday, Marietje Schaake, the head of the EU Observer Mission, said the court ruling represented ""a historic day for Kenya and we have always said that people who feel aggrieved should seek the path of the courts"". She said the monitors had at the time pointed to irregularities and encouraged the Kenyan authorities to deal with them. Ms Schaake said the monitors were awaiting the full details of the ruling. Dickens Olewe, BBC News Raila Odinga will feel vindicated against accusations that he was just being a bad loser in challenging President Kenyatta's win. However, this historic decision is a massive indictment of the electoral commission. It is therefore no surprise that the opposition Nasa coalition is now calling for a new team to manage the next elections. This is also a setback for the international, and some local, election observers, who profusely praised the election as free, fair and credible. People will be watching for the reaction of former US Secretary of State John Kerry, who was the head of the mission for US NGO, the Carter Centre, whose positive assessment of the election was used in court. Regardless of the winners and losers following the ruling, this is a proud moment for Kenya.

Inquiry into Canada flight delay ordeal,"The passengers of two international flights were held for up to six hours The Canadian Transportation Agency is holding an inquiry into two Air Transat flights held on the tarmac at Ottawa for hours in conditions passengers called ""deplorable"". The flights from Brussels and Rome were diverted on 31 July amid bad weather in Montreal and Toronto. Passengers said they were stranded for up to six hours without adequate air conditioning, food or water. Travellers on one flight eventually rang emergency services. The two international flights were among 20 diverted to Ottawa from Montreal and Toronto. Air Transat said that numerous factors beyond its control, including long waits for fuel, had resulted in its inability to reduce the delay and allow passengers to disembark safely. Flight staff said food and water were running low but that refreshments were available and temperatures seemed acceptable. Delayed air passengers call 911 What would make your flight more fun? But travellers who gave statements or testified before the inquiry painted a very different picture, with some describing a growing frustration and panic fuelled by poor communication from airline staff. More than one passenger testified during the public hearings that they felt they were seen simply as ""luggage"". In a statement to the panel, passengers Alan and Patricia Abraham, of Flight 507 from Rome, said they were initially told the delay in Ottawa would be just 45 minutes to refuel. The plane ended up held for five hours. The couple said they were stranded in the stuffy plane, were given a small meal and only once offered a small glass of water. ""The bathroom had run out of toilet paper. One young boy became nauseous and was trying to make his way to the bathroom when he vomited in the aisle and all over several passengers two rows behind us,"" they said. ""The stench was unbearable."" Air Transat says many factors contributed to the delay on 31 July Pilot Yves St-Laurent testified before the CTA panel that the tarmac delay seemed like ""the lesser evil"" compared to the logistics of getting passengers off the aircraft and sending them through customs, and then arranging transport and accommodation for them. Pilots have the final say on whether to unload a plane. He said he did not consider disembarking the aircraft as he was consistently told it would be refuelled in short order. ""If we had known that the delay would be longer than three hours, the decisions would have been very different,"" Mr St-Laurent said, adding that the air conditioning stopped working only for a minute or two. Can we pack in more planes? People on board Flight 157 from Brussels to Montreal were experiencing similar conditions to Flight 507. They ended up being stranded for six hours. At one point passengers chanted ""open the door, open the door"" to cabin crew. The cabin temperature reached more than 31C (87F). Pilot Denis Lussier also said he was told his plane would be quickly refuelled. He added that his flight was short on fuel when it landed and that the air conditioning was cut off when the power shut off. Passengers eventually rang the emergency services to complain of the heat and inability to disembark, and emergency responders came to their assistance and handed out water. Several of the passengers shared their ordeal on social media while inside the planes. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Both pilots said they had not received any calls from passengers to get off in Ottawa. Airline CEO Jean-Francois Lemay said on Thursday that ""something did not work well, obviously"" on 31 July. ""I am not saying there is a fault or blame but there is a collective responsibility that has to be observed in these events."" Christophe Hennebelle, vice president of corporate affairs, said other planes also suffered significant delays, but that Air Transat was being singled out because of the media attention over the call to emergency services.

VW and Toyota launch scrappage schemes,"Renault-Nissan and Kia are the latest car companies to launch car trade-in schemes, aimed at persuading UK customers to swap older, more polluting, car models for new ones. Earlier Volkswagen and Toyota announced diesel scrappage schemes, joining BMW, Ford, Hyundai, Mercedes-Benz and Vauxhall who have all launched schemes. The car companies will accept trade-ins from any brand registered before 2010. It comes as the ""toughest ever"" new-car emissions tests begin to be rolled out. Kia and Renault are offering Â£2,000 off new models, for part-exchanged vehicles, all of which will be taken off the road. Nissan is calling its scheme a ""switch"" scheme since not all the cars traded in will be scrapped. The firm is also offering a Â£2,000 incentive and encouraging customers to consider buying their all-electric Leaf model. VW will give discounts of up to Â£6,000 to trade in diesel vehicles when buying a new car. Meanwhile, Toyota is offering up to Â£4,000 off models more than seven years old. Amongst the biggest firms marketing cars in the UK only Peugeot, Landrover, Honda, Citroen, Fiat and Volvo, have not announced trade-in schemes. Car manufacturers have been under increasing political pressure, especially in Germany, to encourage consumers to buy less polluting cars. It follows VW's ""Dieselgate"" scandal, in which 11 million vehicles worldwide were found to have cheated on emissions tests. VW's German scrappage scheme offered discounts of up to 10,000 euros VW's UK scheme, which includes all its UK brands - including Audi, Seat, Skoda and VW Commercial Vehicles - followsan initiative launched in Germany. VW's German scheme offered a discount of up to 10,000 euros (Â£9,000) to trade in diesel vehicles. Its UK scheme will apply to any diesel vehicle that has emissions standards lower than Euro 5 and was registered before 2010. Incentives range from Â£1,800 off a new VW Up! to Â£6,000 off a Sharan people carrier. Electric and hybrid vehicles, which attract government grants, will be included in the scheme. Ford launched a scrappage scheme in August Tim Urquhart, principal analyst at IHS Automotive, said the move was both about restoring VW's credibility after ""dieselgate"" and boosting sales. ""We've seen a bit of a drop in the UK car market this year after years of really accelerated growth. I think the manufacturers are looking to get people into their showrooms,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""At the same time VW are showing they are being socially responsible. They are getting some of these older diesel vehicles off the roads."" Jim Holder, editorial director of Haymarket Automotive, told the BBC that VW's scrappage incentives would vary from country to country, due to factors such as transport costs and vehicles being cheaper in its home market. However, he said VW would probably have pitched their discounts in order to compete with rival schemes in the UK market. Toyota's scheme offers discounts of up to Â£4,000 VW's UK scheme offers substantially higher discounts than some of its competitors, which seem to hover around the Â£2,000 mark as an upper limit. However, Mr Holder said it was not clear what impact the VW scheme would have on vehicle sales. ""Owners of older vehicles typically don't have the money to spend on a new vehicle, even with these discounts - in normal circumstances it would be far more likely that they would trade up to another, less old, used car."" Toyota's scheme runs from 1 September to 31 December and is open to any vehicle more than seven years old. Customers can get a discount of Â£2,000 off models including Aygo, Prius and Hilux, and Â£4,000 off a Land Cruiser. Paul Van der Burgh, Toyota GB managing director, said: ""Our scrappage scheme is a win-win solution. Motorists can dispose of their older vehicles and have access to our cleaner, more efficient model range."" It comes as tougher emissions tests begin to be rolled out across the European Union on Friday. As well as a new laboratory test, all newly launched car models will have to undergo robust ""on-road"" testing before they go on sale. The Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders said the tests would better reflect modern driving habits. They will also be more stringent than any other vehicle testing regime in the world. Chief executive Mike Hawes said: ""Combined, these new and demanding tests will soon give consumers emissions performance information that is far closer to what they experience behind the wheel. ""They will also inspire greater confidence that the new cars they buy are not only the cleanest, but the most fuel efficient ever produced.""

Judges annul Kenya presidential election,"This video can not be played A Kenyan opposition stronghold celebrates the decision Kenya's Supreme Court has annulled the result of last month's presidential election, citing irregularities, and ordered a new one within 60 days. The election commission had declared incumbent Uhuru Kenyatta the winner by a margin of 1.4 million votes. Raila Odinga, Mr Kenyatta's opponent, said the commission was ""rotten"" and demanded resignations and prosecutions. President Kenyatta said he would respect the court's decision but also branded the judges ""crooks"". Other elections in Africa have been annulled or cancelled but this appears to be the first time on the continent that an opposition court challenge against a presidential poll result has been successful. What next for Kenya after void election? The brave judge who made Kenyan history Friday's events as they happened Chief Justice David Maraga said the 8 August election had not been ""conducted in accordance with the constitution"" and declared it ""invalid, null and void"". He said the verdict was backed by four of the six Supreme Court judges. The announcement drew cheers from opposition supporters both inside and outside the courtroom. The court ruling did not attribute any blame to President Kenyatta's party or campaign. Justice Maraga said the election commission had failed ""to conduct the presidential election in a manner consistent with the dictates of the constitution"". This video can not be played Justice Maraga declares the election ""invalid, null and void"" He said the commission had committed irregularities ""in the transmission of results"", adding that the court would provide details in a full judgment within 21 days. Dissenting judges said that the Nasa opposition alliance - which had petitioned the Supreme Court - failed to prove claims that the polls had been rigged. The election sparked days of sporadic protests, in which at least 28 people were killed. The vote had raised fears of major political violence - as was the case after a disputed poll in 2007. Mr Odinga, 72, said the ruling marked ""a historic day for the people of Kenya and by extension for the people of the continent of Africa"". He said: ""It is now clear that the entire [electoral commission] is rotten. ""It is clear that the real election results were never shared with Kenyans. Someone must take responsibility."" Raila Odinga (C) reacts with delight in the courtroom Mr Odinga added: ""We won the elections and we are going to win them again."" President Kenyatta, in a televised address, said that it was ""important to respect the rule of law even if you disagree with the Supreme Court ruling"". Uhuru Kenyatta: Kenya's 'digital president' Raila Odinga - the man Kenyans either love or loathe He called for calm, saying: ""Your neighbour will still be your neighbour, regardless of what has happened... My primary message today to every single Kenyan is peace. Let us be people of peace."" Uhuru Kenyatta, in power since 2013, won a second term at last month's poll, which has now been declared invalid Mr Kenyatta, 55, added: ""We are ready to go back again to the people with the same agenda that we delivered to the people."" The president was more combative later at a rally of supporters in a market in Nairobi. He referred to Justice Maraga and his fellow judges as wakora (crooks in Swahili), saying they had ""decided to cancel the election"". He warned the chief justice that as the poll had been annulled he was now the president again, not president-elect. ""Do you understand me? Maraga should know that he is now dealing with the serving president,"" Mr Kenyatta said. ""We are keeping a close eye on them. But let us deal with the election first. We are not afraid."" Chairman Wafula Chebukati noted the ruling and said there would be ""changes to personnel"" ahead of the new election. He invited the director of public prosecutions ""to prosecute any of our staff that may have been involved in violations"". But he ruled out resigning, saying he had not been accused of wrongdoing. After the election, international monitors from the EU, the African Union and the US had said there was no major fraud on polling day and urged Mr Odinga to concede. On Friday, Marietje Schaake, the head of the EU Observer Mission, said the court ruling represented ""a historic day for Kenya and we have always said that people who feel aggrieved should seek the path of the courts"". She said the monitors had at the time pointed to irregularities and encouraged the Kenyan authorities to deal with them. Ms Schaake said the monitors were awaiting the full details of the ruling. Dickens Olewe, BBC News Raila Odinga will feel vindicated against accusations that he was just being a bad loser in challenging President Kenyatta's win. However, this historic decision is a massive indictment of the electoral commission. It is therefore no surprise that the opposition Nasa coalition is now calling for a new team to manage the next elections. This is also a setback for the international, and some local, election observers, who profusely praised the election as free, fair and credible. People will be watching for the reaction of former US Secretary of State John Kerry, who was the head of the mission for US NGO, the Carter Centre, whose positive assessment of the election was used in court. Regardless of the winners and losers following the ruling, this is a proud moment for Kenya. The litigation and debate on the merits of the election was done at the Supreme Court and not on the streets. Chief Justice Maraga said it best in his opening statement: ""The greatness of a nation lies in its fidelity to the constitution and the strict adherence to the rule of law.""

'Many workers penalised' over flexi-time,"Two out of five low-paid young parents who ask for flexible work arrangements are ""penalised"" as a result, according to a TUC survey. They are given fewer hours, worse shifts and some have lost their jobs, its survey of 1,000 parents suggested. About half of low-paid young mums and dads are struggling to manage work and childcare, the trades union body said. A government spokesperson said businesses must have a legitimate reason to refuse flexible working. The TUC survey found that more than half of those working in low-paid sectors, such as retail, hospitality and social care, did not know their employment rights, with many unaware of unpaid parental leave arrangements. All the young parents the TUC spoke to had at least one child aged between 1 and 16, were themselves aged between 20 and 35, had household earnings of less than Â£28,000, and none found it very easy to organise childcare with their working hours. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""Too many workplaces expect mums and dads to forget all about their kids as soon as they walk through the door. Every employee in the UK has the statutory right to request flexible working after 26 weeks of employment. Requests should be in writing, stating the date of the request and whether any previous application has been made and the date of that application. Requests and appeals must be considered and decided upon within three months of the receipt of the request. Employers must have a sound business reason for rejecting any request. Employees can only make one request in any 12-month period. Can your job be as flexible as this? Is flexible working biased against non-parents? How to ask the boss for flexible working Ms O'Grady said: ""It's a nightmare to plan childcare when your boss changes your shifts at the drop of a hat, and you never work the same weekly hours twice. ""Many parents fear losing shifts, taking unpaid leave or being viewed badly at work if they need time off to look after their kids."" She said it was ""shocking"" that some mums and dads were stopped from taking their children to hospital when they were sick. She added that workers should be told their shift pattern at least one month in advance. Ben Willmott, head of public policy at HR professional body the CIPD, told the BBC that employers can be more innovative about flexible working. ""Certainly employers can do more about communicating the rights that people do have for time off to care for dependents,"" he said. ""Flexible working can be quite exclusive - home working is often too restricted to managers and senior professionals. Employers should absolutely be looking at the practices that they have [to] make them more inclusive."" Ben Wilson, executive director at the Equality and Human Rights Commission, called for a radical overhaul of company cultures to make flexible working the norm. ""We have been calling for all jobs to be advertised as available for flexible working in order to remove the barriers people, particularly parents, face to increased pay and fulfilling careers."" A spokesperson for the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said that more than 20 million people in the UK were eligible to request flexible working, and businesses must have a legitimate reason to refuse a request. ""We commissioned Matthew Taylor to review modern working practices to ensure our employment rules and rights keep up to date to reflect new ways of working. ""We are consideringhis reportcarefully and will respond in due course,"" the spokesperson added.

Arrest after 'abhorrent' kangaroo killing,"The clip shows a man attacking a kangaroo with a knife A man has been arrested in Melbourne after a video showing a man slashing at a wounded kangaroo's throat went viral. The 43-year-old man was charged with destroying protected wildlife, said authorities in the state of Victoria. Officers also seized knives and firearms from his home, they said. Environment officials described the incident as ""particularly abhorrent"". If convicted under Victorian law, the man faces up to two years in jail and a fine of A$38,056 (Â£23,000; $30,000). The short video clip, shared widely on Chinese messaging app WeChat, starts with a man approaching a wounded kangaroo lying on a hillside. The kangaroo is seen kicking several times and making noises, so the man eventually approaches it from behind. He then grabs its tail and steps on its back, before repeatedly cutting its throat with a large hunting knife until the kangaroo stops moving. People can be heard laughing in the background. ""We take all alleged cases of animal cruelty very seriously,"" said Glenn Sharp, a spokesman for Victoria's Department of Environment, Land, Water and Planning. ""The wildlife offences captured in this video are particularly abhorrent."" He thanked members of the public for coming forward with information. The man has been granted bail and will appear in court at a later date. RSPCA receives 400 cruelty calls per day Are we tough enough on animal cruelty?

""Making the necessary changes will be painful,"" it acknowledges, ""but the costs to public health cannot be ignored"". The Times says for an industry that relies on expert judgement,externalin studying form and setting odds, betting operators have an uncanny knack of shooting themselves in the foot. It says modest cuts in stakes and prizes might be enough to satisfy critics, but the industry's poor record on responsible gambling is shortening the odds of a drastic outcome. The Daily Telegraph is among the papers to concentrate on the role of a sat-nav,externalin the alleged terror attack outside Buckingham Palace a week ago. Evidence taken from the car of Mohiussunath Chowdhury, who appeared in court on Thursday, suggests he programmed his sat-nav for Windsor Castle. However, the in-car system is believed to have taken him to a central London pub of the same name rather than to the castle itself. TheTimes,externaland theSun,externalpoint out that the suspect was a driver for taxi firm Uber. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external Trying to stop yourself yawning actually increases the urge, according to a study published inthe i newspaper,external. The Daily Express focuses on a different aspect of the research,external, which suggests that studying contagious yawning could hold the key to a future cure for dementia, as the tendency to catch a yawn is controlled by a particular part of the brain. The Daily Mail says Italians have been left ""fizzing with rage"",externalat claims that too much Prosecco damages your teeth. But the Daily Telegraph says they have misunderstood the British attitude to health,external- saying that even definitive proof that something is bad for you is no guarantee of a fall in sales. The paper says Prosecco will remain popular as long as it remains a budget alternative to Champagne. The Times considers whether criticising other countries' popular exports,externalis a clever post-Brexit strategy. ""Those Leonardo and Michaelangelo guys are overrated, Roman Catholicism is a passing cult,"" the paper muses, before concluding that the idea may require further refinement.

Inefficient vacuum cleaner sales banned,"Sales of vacuum cleaners producing more noise and heat than suction are restricted under EU rules from today. Vacuum cleaners using more than 900 watts and emitting more than 80 decibels will be banned when stocks run out. Some anti-EU campaigners say homes won't be properly cleaned if people have to buy lower wattage machines. But energy experts say the best low-power appliances clean just as well as high-wattage machines. They say some manufacturers deliberately increased the amount of electricity their appliances use because shoppers equate high-wattage with high performance. The European Environment Bureau (EEB) said: ""Power doesn't always equal performance, though the misconception has become widespread. ""Some efficient models maintained high standards of dust pick-up while using significantly less energy - due to design innovation."" Vacuum cleaner salesman Howard Johnson, who works in Coventry, told BBC News: ""People want a more powerful vacuum cleaner but they can't see that more power doesn't mean more suction. ""The lower power machines are perfectly adequate, and better for the planet"". Less power doesn't have to mean less suction, say experts The EU's own website says: ""With more efficient vacuum cleaners, Europe as a whole can save up to 20 TWh of electricity per year by 2020. ""This is equivalent to the annual household electricity consumption of Belgium. ""It also means over 6 million tonnes of CO2 will not be emitted - about the annual emissions of eight medium-sized power plants."" And the UK Climate Change Committee says that since 2008 electricity demand is down 17% (despite all our gadgets) and gas demand is 23% lower, thanks to tougher standards on energy efficiency in homes and appliances. This, it says, has helped keep bills down. But there's a question over what happens to EU energy standards after Brexit. UKIP's Roger Helmer said: ""By all means let's make pathetic under-powered vacuum cleaners for export to the EU. ""But we must retain the right to make and use sensible full-powered appliances in the UK. This shows why we must not agree to be bound by EU rules after Brexit."" The EEB replied: ""Without EU energy efficiency rules, the UK market risks getting flooded with inefficient and cheap imports from China which waste more energy and break easily due to lower standards."" Efficiency standards are so effective at driving down bills and emissions that it's believed they will be kept after Brexit. But the government's statement to BBC News on the issue was ambiguous. A spokeswoman said: ""Until we leave the EU, the UK government continues to implement European regulations. ""We support measures that will save households and businesses money on their energy bills."" Sir James Dyson has gone to court over the issue Vacuum cleaner entrepreneur Sir James Dyson has been in a court battle with the EU because he says the vacuum standards test doesn't replicate real world conditions. His spokesman told BBC News: ""We agree with the principle of using standards to drive products that use less energy. ""But we think that technical innovation itself would be a better way of changing consumer behaviour. ""You can have a perfectly good vacuum cleaner running with lower energy."" The latest Dyson model does qualify under the new EU rules. Next week the government will be presented with a major report from energy economists making the case for a big boost to the economy through energy efficiency in homes.

'Deplorable' Canada flight delay probed,"The passengers of two international flights were held for up to six hours The Canadian Transportation Agency is holding an inquiry into two Air Transat flights held on the tarmac at Ottawa for hours in conditions passengers called ""deplorable"". The flights from Brussels and Rome were diverted on 31 July amid bad weather in Montreal and Toronto. Passengers said they were stranded for up to six hours without adequate air conditioning, food or water. Travellers on one flight eventually rang emergency services. The two international flights were among 20 diverted to Ottawa from Montreal and Toronto. Air Transat said that numerous factors beyond its control, including long waits for fuel, had resulted in its inability to reduce the delay and allow passengers to disembark safely. Flight staff said food and water were running low but that refreshments were available and temperatures seemed acceptable. Delayed air passengers call 911 What would make your flight more fun? But travellers who gave statements or testified before the inquiry painted a very different picture, with some describing a growing frustration and panic fuelled by poor communication from airline staff. More than one passenger testified during the public hearings that they felt they were seen simply as ""luggage"". In a statement to the panel, passengers Alan and Patricia Abraham, of Flight 507 from Rome, said they were initially told the delay in Ottawa would be just 45 minutes to refuel. The plane ended up held for five hours. The couple said they were stranded in the stuffy plane, were given a small meal and only once offered a small glass of water. ""The bathroom had run out of toilet paper. One young boy became nauseous and was trying to make his way to the bathroom when he vomited in the aisle and all over several passengers two rows behind us,"" they said. ""The stench was unbearable."" Air Transat says many factors contributed to the delay on 31 July Pilot Yves St-Laurent testified before the CTA panel that the tarmac delay seemed like ""the lesser evil"" compared to the logistics of getting passengers off the aircraft and sending them through customs, and then arranging transport and accommodation for them. Pilots have the final say on whether to unload a plane. He said he did not consider disembarking the aircraft as he was consistently told it would be refuelled in short order. ""If we had known that the delay would be longer than three hours, the decisions would have been very different,"" Mr St-Laurent said, adding that the air conditioning stopped working only for a minute or two. Can we pack in more planes? People on board Flight 157 from Brussels to Montreal were experiencing similar conditions to Flight 507. They ended up being stranded for six hours. At one point passengers chanted ""open the door, open the door"" to cabin crew. The cabin temperature reached more than 31C (87F). Pilot Denis Lussier also said he was told his plane would be quickly refuelled. He added that his flight was short on fuel when it landed and that the air conditioning was cut off when the power shut off. Passengers eventually rang the emergency services to complain of the heat and inability to disembark, and emergency responders came to their assistance and handed out water. Several of the passengers shared their ordeal on social media while inside the planes. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Both pilots said they had not received any calls from passengers to get off in Ottawa. Airline CEO Jean-Francois Lemay said on Thursday that ""something did not work well, obviously"" on 31 July. ""I am not saying there is a fault or blame but there is a collective responsibility that has to be observed in these events."" Christophe Hennebelle, vice president of corporate affairs, said other planes also suffered significant delays, but that Air Transat was being singled out because of the media attention over the call to emergency services.
