What is Shamima Begum's legal status?,"Ms Begum was 15 and living in Bethnal Green, London, when she left the UK in 2015 Shamima Begum - the schoolgirl who fled London to join the Islamic State group in Syria - has been stripped of her UK citizenship after expressing a desire to return. It is only possible to strip someone of their UK nationality if they are eligible for citizenship elsewhere - and it is thought Ms Begum could be a Bangladeshi citizen because she was born to a mother believed to be Bangladeshi. However, Bangladesh's ministry of foreign affairs has said Ms Begum is not a Bangladeshi citizen and there is ""no question"" of her being allowed into the country. Expert lawyers with experience in Bangladeshi citizenship cases have told the BBC that under Bangladesh law, a UK national like Ms Begum, if born to a Bangladeshi parent, is automatically a Bangladeshi citizen. That means that such a person would have dual nationality. If the person remains in the UK, their Bangladeshi citizenship remains in existence but dormant. Under this ""blood line"" law, Bangladeshi nationality and citizenship lapse when a person reaches the age of 21, unless they make efforts to activate and retain it. So, it is Ms Begum's age, 19, that is likely - in part - to have given Home Office lawyers and the home secretary reassurance there was a legal basis for stripping her of her UK citizenship. IS teenager to lose UK citizenship IS bride 'is not Bangladeshi citizen' How do countries deal with IS returnees? In 2018, the government lost an appeal case brought by two British citizens of Bangladeshi origin who were stripped of their citizenship when they were abroad. The Special Immigration Appeals Commission ruled that E3 and N3 had not tried to retain their citizenship before they reached the age of 21, and so it had automatically lapsed. This video can not be played Shamima Begum: ""I got tricked and I was hoping someone would have sympathy with me"" That meant that the decision to strip them of their UK citizenship had rendered them stateless. Ms Begum's case is different. Her Bangladeshi citizenship, if established, would remain intact until she reaches 21, even if she has never visited the country or made active efforts to retain her citizenship. Home Secretary Sajid Javid has suggested that the decision to remove Ms Begum's UK citizenship will have no impact on her baby son's nationality. While refusing to comment on individual cases, he told the Commons: ""Children should not suffer. So, if a parent does lose their British citizenship, it does not affect the rights of their child."" Lord Carlile, former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said the baby may also be entitled to Bangladeshi and Dutch nationality - Ms Begum's husband is a Dutch convert to Islam, who she married in Syria. As a British citizen, Ms Begum's child would have a right to enter the UK. However the British government has no consular staff in Syria to help get him out of the country. Even if that were possible, the question of whether he should be separated from his mother would open up a whole new moral conundrum. And after losing two children to illness in Syria, Ms Begum seems desperate to keep her third.

The Universal Declaration of Human Rights,externalstates that everyone has the right to a nationality and ""no-one shall be arbitrarily deprived of their nationality"". The home secretary has the power,externalto strip an individual of their British citizenship on the basis that it is ""conducive to the public good"", as long as the person would not become stateless as a result.

However, Mr Javid has said the Home Office would never take that decision if someone only had one nationality. Effectively, yes. If both your parents were born in the UK and you do not have dual nationality, it would not be possible for the Home Office to strip you of your British citizenship, as this would leave you stateless. But for a British child of a dual national or immigrant, who is eligible for another nationality, it would be. Lord Anderson, a former independent reviewer of terrorism legislation, said it ""effectively brings about two classes of citizenship"". She would need to bring a legal challenge against the home secretary's decision to strip her of her citizenship. This would be heard at the Special Immigration Appeals Commission (Siac). If her family disagreed with that panel's decision, they could appeal on a point of law to a higher court, and ultimately to the UK Supreme Court. Since 2015, Siachas heard seven cases involving loss of citizenship,external, of which two were successful. But it can take years before a case is brought to Siac - so there could be a lot of cases that are still waiting to be heard. Until very recently, the power to strip an individual of their citizenship was rarely used. In 2016 it was used just 14 times, but this increased to 104 in 2017 - the latest year data is available.

Begum family's letter in full,"Shamima Begum was 15 and living in Bethnal Green, London, when she left the UK in 2015 Shamima Begum's sister Renu has written a letter to Home Secretary Sajid Javid, which has been seen by the BBC. Here is the letter in full. Dear Mr Javid, I write to you on behalf of both myself and the rest of Shamima Begum's family. We are, as has previously been expressed through our solicitor, disappointed with your decision to begin the process of stripping Shamima of her British citizenship. Firstly, we wish to make clear, that along with the rest of the country, we are shocked and appalled at the vile comments she has made to the media in recent days. These are not representative of British values, and my family entirely reject the comments she has made. My family went to every fathomable effort in February 2015 to attempt to block Shamima from getting into ISIS territory. We contacted and cooperated with all the relevant government agencies in both the UK and Turkey to try and stop her progress. Unfortunately, our efforts were in vain. That year we lost Shamima to a murderous and misogynistic cult. My sister has been in their thrall now for four years, and it is clear to me that her exploitation at their hands has fundamentally damaged her. I have watched Shamima on our televisions open her mouth and set fire to our nations emotions. As we have already expressed, we are sickened by the comments she has made, but, as a family man yourself, we hope you will understand that we, as her family cannot simply abandon her. We have a duty to her, and a duty to hope that as she was groomed into what she has become, she can equally be helped back into the sister I knew, and daughter my parents bore. We hope you understand our position in this respect and why we must, therefore, assist Shamima in challenging your decision to take away the one thing that is her only hope at rehabilitation, her British citizenship. Shamima's status will now be a matter for our British courts to decide in due course. We seek solace in the fact that the institution of our courts as independent arbitrators of this nation's laws have served as a bastion of good practice to the world. My family trusts that this institution will properly perform its functions and entrusts Shamima's future to its decision-making process. Neither myself or any of my family have had any contact with Shamima. We have discovered from media reports, along with the rest of the country, that she gave birth to a baby boy. We were pleased to learn from your comments in the Commons that you recognise my nephew, Shamima's son, as a British citizen. As a family, we ask now how we can assist you in bringing my nephew home to us. In all of this debacle, he is the one true innocent and should not lose the privilege of being raised in the safety of this country. We request that your office contacts our solicitor, Mr Akunjee, to discuss the practical mechanics of how to help my nephew find his way home.

"Boy, 16, guilty of Alesha rape and murder","This video can not be played Alesha MacPhail murder: Teenager found guilty A 16-year-old boy has been found guilty of the abduction, rape and murder of six-year-old Alesha MacPhail. Her naked body was found on the Isle of Bute after she was reported missing on the morning of 2 July last year. Alesha had suffered 117 injuries and died from significant pressure being applied to her face and neck. The teenager - who cannot be named because he is under 18 - was found guilty after a nine-day trial at the High Court in Glasgow. Judge Lord Matthews told the killer he had stolen Alesha's life by ""committing some of the most wicked and evil crimes this court has ever heard of in decades of dealing with depravity"". He said he had ""no idea"" why the teenager carried out the murder, and described the evidence in the case as ""overwhelming"". The killer caught by his mother's CCTV The little girl with the 'big beautiful smile' The jury took three hours to return its unanimous verdict. The boy showed no emotion as it was read out in court. In a witness impact statement, Alesha's mother Georgina Lochrane said her world had been ripped from her. She added that she ""had nightmares"" about what happened to her daughter. Alesha's mother Georgina Lochrane said her world had been ripped from her In a statement released after the verdict, Ms Lochrane, said: ""Words cannot express just how devastated I am to have lost my beautiful, happy, smiley wee girl. ""I am glad that the boy who did this has finally been brought to justice and that he will not be able to inflict the pain on another family that he has done to mine. ""Alesha, I love you so much, my wee pal. I will miss you forever."" Alesha's mother wrote a message which read: ""I love you more than this world"" Alesha's father Robert MacPhail said day-to-day life was ""almost impossible"". Prosecutor Iain McSporran QC, told the court the loss of a child would be hard to bear in any circumstance, but the ""bestial manner"" in which Alesha was murdered was ""simply unfathomable"". The boy, who faces detention without limit of time, will be sentenced on 21 March. The senior investigating officer on the case, Det Supt Stuart Houston, spoke outside the court. He said: ""Alesha's senseless and barbaric murder shocked the small community on Bute and people across Scotland. The effects of her death are still being felt today."" Det Supt Stuart Houston said the investigation had been ""challenging"" for police officers He added: ""Investigating any murder is challenging for all the police officers and staff involved. To be faced with the death of a little girl in such a cold and cruel way was extremely difficult for everyone. ""Crimes such as this are extremely rare and I am glad that we have been able to get justice for Alesha and her family."" Alesha was just days into a three-week holiday on Bute when she was taken from her grandparents' home on Ardbeg Road, Rothesay. Her grandparents, father and his girlfriend, who were sleeping in the flat, did not hear her being lifted from her bed. A major search was launched when the family woke to find that Alesha was missing. The six-year-old's body was found in the grounds of a former hotel on the island. Alesha's father Robert MacPhail and his girlfriend Toni McLachlan gave evidence in the trial Robert MacPhail and his girlfriend Toni McLachlan with Alesha, aged six The killer's own mother later alerted detectives after reviewing footage from two CCTV cameras outside the family home, which showed him coming and going three times between 01:54 and 04:07. Separate footage from two houses on Marine Place captured an eerie figure walking along the shoreline around 02:25. The individual appeared to be carrying something in front of them. A pathologist told the jury Alesha, who lived in Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, had no marks on her feet. This means she was carried to her death, a journey police estimate would have taken up to 17 minutes. DNA evidence linking the accused to the scene was also recovered on Alesha's body and on the clothes she had worn to bed. A forensic expert told the court the chances of the samples belonging to anyone other than the 16-year-old were more than one in a billion. The jury heard the teenager previously bought cannabis from Alesha's father, Robert MacPhail, but the pair fell out five months before her death over an unpaid Â£10 drug debt. At the start of the trial the accused lodged a special defence of incrimination blaming Mr MacPhail's girlfriend, Toni McLachlan, for the murder. The 18-year-old, who was the last person in the flat to see Alesha alive, denied having anything to do with the crime. It is illegal in Scotland to publish the name, address, school or any other information which could identify anyone under the age of 18 who is the accused, victim or witness in a criminal case This law applies to social media as well as to websites, newspapers and TV and radio programmes. Any violation is considered a serious contempt of court and could result in a fine or jail term. However, the name of victims who have died can be published - so the BBC and other outlets are able to identify Alesha MacPhail.

May reaches out to Remainer rebels,"Theresa May has held meetings with leading Tory Remainers, amid speculation about further defections. Justine Greening and Phillip Lee say Mrs May has ignored requests from pro-EU Tory MPs in favour of Brexiteers. The pair had separate meetings with the PM in Downing Street. Meanwhile, one ex-Labour member of the new Independent Group of MPs has said it could help keep Mrs May in power on condition that she agreed to another EU referendum with Remain as an option. However, the PM was focused on her own party on Thursday, as she met cabinet ministers David Gauke and Greg Clark. The pair have warned of the dangers to business of leaving the EU without a formal deal, an option which Brexiteers in the European Research Group of Conservative MPs insist must be preserved as negotiating leverage in Brussels. Thegovernment said on Thursday that talks would continue ""urgently""at a technical level, following ""productive"" meetings involving Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay, Attorney General Geoffrey Cox and the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier. Who are the Independent Group and what do they want? What does it feel like to quit a party? Nicholas Watt: A lonely PM nears the Brexit endgame In the UK, ex-Labour MP Gavin Shukertold The Huffington Post,externalmembers of the new Independent Group had first made the offer of a potential confidence and supply agreement - like the one the DUP has with the government - last month in a meeting with the PM's second-in-command David Lidington. Then-Labour MPs Chris Leslie, Luciana Berger and Chuka Umunna, along with then-Tory Anna Soubry, who have all joined the group this week, were also at the meeting. Mr Shuker said he had told Mr Lidington he would support any type of deal provided there was a ""confirmatory referendum"" to get public backing but that the offer was rejected. Phillip Lee met Theresa May for talks in Downing Street The leaders of both main parties are battling to prevent more defections after eight Labour MPs and three Tories broke away to form a new ""centrist"" group in Parliament. Theresa May has written to the three Tory defectors - Anna Soubry, Heidi Allen and Sarah Wollaston - to reject what she describes as the ""picture they paint of the party"", saying its record on the NHS, employment and diversity proved it was ""moderate"" and ""open-hearted"". The prime minister offered to ""continue to work together on issues"" where they agree - but told the three she rejected ""the parallel you draw with the way Jeremy Corbyn and the hard left have warped a once-proud Labour Party"". In response to their claim that local Tory associations are being taken over by former UKIP members, Mrs May said: ""An open, broad party should always welcome new members and supporters with a range of views, including those who have previously supported other parties.""

But she said local party branches had been warned to ensure new members support the party's ""values and objectives"". Ex-Tory MP Heidi Allen, one of the three defectors from the party, told ITV's Peston programme ""a third"" of Conservative MPs were fed up with the party's direction. Ms Greening and Mr Lee, who quit as a justice minister over Brexit, have been named by Ms Allen as potential future defectors to the Independent Group. The Right to Vote group, which is chaired by Mr Lee, said he had discussed the campaign's calls for a pause in the Brexit process and a possible second referendum with Mrs May. ""Talks were open and we are encouraged she listened to our case,"" the group said. This video can not be played ""I don't think I would be able to stay part of a party that was simply a Brexit party that had crashed us out of the EU"" Mr Lee has said one of the reasons the Tory MPs decided to quit the party was the access the Brexiteer European Research Group got to the prime minister, who he said had refused to meet his wing of the party. Justine Greening - a former education secretary - told the Today programme she had been tempted to break away from the Conservative Party and join the Independent Group. ""It is something that I have considered, but I have reached a different conclusion for the moment,"" Ms Greening told Today. ""I don't think I would be able to stay part of a party that was simply a Brexit party that had crashed us out of the European Union."" The Independent Group was set up by eight defecting Labour MPs unhappy with their party's handling of Brexit and anti-Semitism. They were later joined by three pro-Remain Tories - who accuse the Conservative leadership of allowing right-wing hardliners to shape the party's approach to Brexit and other matters. Labour's Ian Austin also expressed sympathy with the Independent Group's aims, saying he would think ""long and hard"" about his future in the Labour Party. Shadow home Secretary Diane Abbott told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: ""I am very sad that the Labour members of this new independent organisation have gone. ""Up until the last minute, people were talking to them, trying to persuade them not to take the step they have taken."" She said she hoped they would continue to work with Labour on issues like homelessness, the benefit system, the NHS and ""most of all fighting this Tory Brexit"". Meanwhile, Labour have contacted the Information Commissioner over alleged attempts to access personal data held by the party. It is understood there are concerns an MP accessed party systems to contact members after reports of their resignation on Tuesday night. Enfield North MP Joan Ryan, who announced she was quitting Labour in an interview with the Times published on Tuesday evening, said: ""Neither I nor my office have accessed or used any Labour Party data since I resigned the Labour Whip and my membership of the Labour Party.""

Car death accused mum guilty of cruelty,"Alfie Lamb was described in court as ""the loveliest boy you could ever meet"" The mother of a three-year-old boy allegedly crushed by a car seat has been found guilty of child cruelty. Adrian Hoare, 23, failed to prevent her boyfriend Stephen Waterson, 25, from allegedly squashing Alfie Lamb in the footwell of his Audi convertible with his seat in February last year. Hoare was cleared of manslaughter while a jury failed to reach a verdict on the same charge for Mr Waterson. The pair previously admitted perverting the course of justice. Hoare and Mr Waterson had been travelling with Emilie Williams and Marcus Lamb, who was driving, and were returning to Croydon from a shopping trip in Sutton, south London on 1 February last year. Adrian Hoare failed to prevent her boyfriend Stephen Waterson from allegedly squashing Alfie In a police interview played to the court, 19-year-old Ms Williams said Mr Waterson's seat ""was right back... because he said he had to stretch his legs right out"". ""Alfie was kicking the chair, asking him to move it forward"" but apart from shifting it ""for a few seconds"", Mr Waterson refused, the jury heard. It was alleged Mr Waterson became annoyed at Alfie's crying and twice moved his front passenger seat into him as he sat at his mother's feet. Despite Alfie's distress, Hoare said the boy was ""getting himself worked up"" and she told him to ""shut up"", Ms Williams said. Stephen Waterson, Adrian Hoare and Alfie Lamb had been on a shopping trip in Sutton, south London She told police Hoare believed Alfie had gone to sleep when he went quiet, then ""thought he was just mucking around"" as she tried to wake him. Ms Williams added that when the boy was lifted from the car by Mr Waterson, he looked ""pale"" and was not moving. By the time they arrived at Mr Waterson's home in Croydon, the boy had collapsed and stopped breathing. Medics tried to revive him but Alfie died from crush asphyxia three days later. Afterwards the defendants lied to police about what happened. Alfie and another child were both in the rear footwell of the car during the journey to Croydon The Old Bailey also heard Ms Williams had been threatened by Mr Waterson, who tried to persuade her to lie about what happened.

R Kelly faces fresh sexual abuse claims,"Rochelle Washington (l), and Latresa Scaff (r) are being represented by lawyer Gloria Allred Two more women have come forward with allegations of sexual misconduct against the R&B singer R Kelly. Rochelle Washington and Latresa Scaff told a news conference they were given drink and drugs at an after-concert party in Baltimore in the 1990s. They said the singer then cornered them in a hotel room and demanded sex. Kelly, 52, has been accused of decades of sexual abuse against women. He has never been convicted and denies all the allegations. Addressing journalists in New York, the two women said they were teenagers when Kelly's security staff picked them out of a concert audience. They were unable to give the exact year but said it was either 1995 or 1996. The history of allegations against R Kelly R Kelly's daughter: He's a monster Is R Kelly's music being shut down? Ms Scaff, 40, said that at the party they were given cocaine, marijuana and alcohol and invited to wait for the singer in his hotel room. Once there, they were told that he was about to arrive and that they should pull up their dresses, she said. The singer arrived with his penis exposed, Ms Scaff said, and invited the girls to a threesome. R Kelly has strongly denied all the allegations against him Ms Washington, now 39, refused and went to the bathroom while Ms Scaff stayed and had sex with him ""even though I did not have the capacity to consent"" because of the drink and drugs, she added. Ms Scaff said she had decided to come forward ""because of all of the other victims"". The two women are represented by high-profile lawyer Gloria Allred who said they would be speaking to the US Attorney for the Eastern District of New York on Thursday. Ms Allred also represents several other women who have made allegations against Kelly. Referring to the star she said: ""You have nowhere to run and nowhere to hide. You have been able to get away with your predatory misconduct for far too long."" R Kelly, whose full name is Robert Sylvester Kelly, has faced claims of sexual abuse for more than 20 years. A recent documentary, Surviving R Kelly, shown on the US channel Lifetime, contained detailed accounts of his alleged physical and emotional abuse of women. It claimed the singer ran an ""abusive cult"" in which he allegedly kept women captive. Kelly's lawyers dismissed the documentary as ""another round of stories"" being used to ""fill reality TV time"". Lady Gaga breaks her silence on R Kelly The history of R.

World's biggest bee found alive,"A single female Wallace's giant bee was found The world's biggest bee has been re-discovered, after decades thought lost to science. The giant bee - which is as long as an adult's thumb - was found on a little-explored Indonesian island. After days of searching, wildlife experts found a single live female, which they photographed and filmed. Known as Wallace's giant bee, the insect is named after the British naturalist and explorer Alfred Russel Wallace, who described it in 1858. Scientists found several specimens in 1981 on three Indonesia islands. It has not been seen alive since, although there was a report last year of two bee specimens being offered for sale online. In January, a team followed in Wallace's footsteps on a journey through Indonesia in an attempt to find and photograph the bee. Eli Wyman with one of the few known Wallace's giant bee samples ""It was absolutely breathtaking to see this 'flying bulldog' of an insect that we weren't sure existed anymore, to have real proof right there in front of us in the wild,"" said natural history photographer, Clay Bolt, who took the first photos and video of the species alive. ""To actually see how beautiful and big the species is in life, to hear the sound of its giant wings thrumming as it flew past my head, was just incredible. "" With an estimated wingspan of two-and-a-half inches (6 cm), Wallace's giant bee is the world's largest bee The female makes her nest in termite mounds, using her large jaw to collect sticky tree resin to line the nest and protect it from invading termites The species depends on primary lowland forest for resin and the nests of tree-dwelling termites Wallace, who co-developed the theory of evolution with Charles Darwin, described the bee as, ""a large black wasp-like insect, with immense jaws like a stag-beetle"". The discovery, in the Indonesian islands known as the North Moluccas, raises hopes that the region's forests still harbour one of the rarest and most sought after insects in the world. There are currently no legal protections around its trade. Trip member and bee expert Eli Wyman, an entomologist at Princeton University, said he hoped the rediscovery would spark research towards a deeper understanding of the life history of the bee and inform any future efforts to protect it from extinction. Wallace's giant bee is currently listed as vulnerable to extinction, according to the International Union for Conservation of Nature. However, the international trade of this species is currently not restricted by the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species. Environmental group, Global Wildlife Conservation (GWC), which has launched a worldwide hunt for ""lost species"", supported the trip to find the bee. ""By making the bee a world-famous flagship for conservation, we are confident that the species has a brighter future than if we just let it quietly be collected into oblivion,"" said Robin Moore. In January, the group announced they had found more rare Bolivian frogs belonging to a species thought to be down to one male. World's 'loneliest' frog gets a date Follow Helen onTwitter,external.

January sees record UK monthly surplus,"Britain's public finances have received a big boost ahead of the chancellor's Spring Statement next month. Income from taxes beat public spending by Â£14.9bn in January, the largest monthly surplus since records began in 1993,official figures showed,external. The bumper surplus beat economists' forecasts of Â£10bn, and was Â£5.6bn greater than January 2018. January is a key revenue-raising month as it is when taxpayers submit their self-assessment returns. Analysts said the reduction in borrowing should give Chancellor Philip Hammond extra money for his next economic update in the spring, amid acute Brexit concerns. Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: ""A record high surplus on the January public finances provides a much-needed welcome boost for Chancellor Philip Hammond as he faces a worrying backdrop to his Spring Statement on 13 March. ""With the economy clearly struggling early on in 2019 after a sharp slowdown in the fourth quarter of 2018 and the Brexit situation highly uncertain, the chancellor will have a lot on his mind when he presents the Spring Statement. ""It looks highly likely that he will have to announce downgraded growth forecasts from the OBR [Office for Budget Responsibility] at least for the near term, with possible negative ramifications for expected budget deficits."" Office for National Statistics (ONS) data also showed that borrowing in the current financial year to January was Â£21.2bn, Â£18.5bn less than the same period last year and the lowest year-to-date figure for 17 years. The ONS added that public sector net debt increased by Â£40.5bn to Â£1.8tn in January, equivalent to 82.6% of gross domestic product (GDP).

Man stabbed to death in Brixton,"Police found the man in Minet Road at 18:45 GMT A 23-year-old man has died after being stabbed in a south London youth club. Police were called to Minet Road, Brixton, at about 18:45 GMT on Thursday where the victim was given first aid by officers at the scene. He was pronounced dead at 19:27. His next of kin have been informed and no arrests have been made, police said. Det Ch Insp Mick Norman said: ""This was an appalling attack on a young man in a youth centre - a place where he was entitled to feel safe."" ""All the early indications are that this attack was premeditated and targeted"", he added. Sandra Smith, whose son was friends with the victim, said her ""heart bleeds"". ""He is a good boy, he is not the sort of boy who goes out and gives trouble,"" she said. Police believe the attack was ""premeditated and targeted"" Maxine Dawson, 46, said she had been outside and seen children as young as seven leaving the centre after the attack. ""I can only imagine the way they were traumatised,"" she added. Pastor and community campaigner Lorraine Jones, whose 20-year-old son Dwayne Simpson was stabbed to death in Brixton in 2014, said the youth club was one of only two in the area serving about 8,000 children. ""The club has been going for many, many years. They have done a huge amount of work, hundreds of thousands if not millions of hours with young people and they need help."" Children as young as seven are believed to have witnessed the attack Police want to hear from those who were at the youth centre either before, during or after the attack. ""The youth centre was open at the time and sadly many young people present would have witnessed what unfolded,"" Det Ch Insp Norman said. The killing brings this year's homicide rate up to 14, nine of which were fatal stabbings. Between October 2017 and September 2018 the number of knife crimes in London hit an eight year high,according to figures from the Office for National Statistics,external(ONS).

Woman dies after Michelin-starred meal,"The woman ate at RiFF restaurant in Valencia with her husband and son Update 24 January 2020: In December 2019, a judge at the Superior Court of Justice of the Valencian Community (TSJCV) ruled that the death of the female diner was due to natural causes and the investigation into RiFF restaurant was closed. A woman has died and 28 more diners fell ill after eating at a Michelin-starred restaurant in Spain. The diner went to RiFF in Valencia with her husband and son, 12, both of whom also had diarrhoea and vomiting. The restaurant is now closed while public health officials investigate the exact cause of the outbreak. RiFF, which has one Michelin star and is described by the guide as serving ""innovative cuisine"", has issued an apology to its customers. Officials tracked down 75 people who ate at the restaurant between 13 and 16 February, and learned that a total of 29 had suffered food poisoning, including three families. This included a 46-year-old woman who ate out with her family on Saturday night and died at home in the early hours of Sunday morning. Tiny beach restaurant wins top award Chef's shock at being back in Michelin The business behind Michelin stars A spokesperson from Valencia's regional ministry of health told BBC News that food safety officers inspected RiFF on Monday but were unable to find an obvious cause. Samples of some of the dishes that were served as part of a tasting menu have now been sent to the National Toxicology Institute for analysis, they added. Some reports have suggested that morel mushrooms may have been to blame, but officials told local media they were waiting for the test results to come back before singling out any particular ingredient. RiFF's owner and head chef Bernd KnÃ¶ller said in a statement that he was working with health officials to establish the facts. ""Regardless of the reason that may have caused this situation, I want to convey my deep regret for what happened, hoping that soon all these facts can be clarified,"" he added. ""I have made the decision that the restaurant remains closed until the causes of what happened are established."" Tiny beach restaurant wins top award What this Michelin chef wants to change.

US actor alleged hoax attack 'despicable',"This video can not be played Jussie Smollett: What Chicago Police say happened A Chicago judge has said charges that US actor Jussie Smollett staged a hoax hate crime against himself are ""utterly outrageous"" and ""despicable"" if true. The 36-year-old African-American actor is accused of filing a fake police report claiming he was the victim of a homophobic and racist assault. Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke, who is also black, said the ""most vile"" part of the incident was the use of a noose. Police say he staged the attack because he was ""dissatisfied with his salary"". The star's lawyers issued a strongly-worded statement after the hearing, calling it an ""organised law enforcement spectacle"" and describing Mr Smollett as ""a young man of impeccable character"". Jussie Smollett emerged from the Cook County Court complex after posting 10% of a $100,000 bond in Chicago ""That symbol conjures up such evil in this country's history,"" Judge Lyke said of a rope that Mr Smollett claimed the attackers had hung round his neck,according to the Chicago Tribune,external. The judge's comments at Thursday's court appearance alluded to the racist lynchings of thousands of black Americans in the post-American Civil War era. Mr Smollett, who stars on the TV series Empire, is suspected of paying two brothers to stage the attack on himself. The siblings are co-operating with the investigation, police say. This video can not be played Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson: ""Smollett dragged city's reputation through mud"" Chicago officials say Mr Smollett also sent a racist letter to himself at a Fox studio before staging the attack. Judge Lyke set Mr Smollett's bail at $100,000 (Â£76,000), which requires him to submit a bond of $10,000 and surrender his passport. Mr Smollett denies the charge of felony disorderly conduct. His lawyers said they would ""mount an aggressive defence"". Timeline of events 'I'm the gay Tupac' Jack Prior, one of the actor's attorneys, told the court the accusations were ""inconsistent with Mr Smollett's character"" and that the actor ""wants nothing more than to clear his name"". If convicted, he could be sentenced to three years in prison and made to pay for the cost of the police investigation. In a news conference earlier on Thursday, Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson lashed out at the ""shameful"" scheme. ""Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations?"" he said. ""How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile?"" Supt Johnson accused Mr Smollett of taking ""advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career"". CCTV image released earlier by Chicago police He said Mr Smollett had betrayed the city of Chicago, and said ""this publicity stunt was a scar that Chicago didn't earn and certainly didn't deserve"". The ""hoax"", he said, ""received national attention for weeks"", and may deter future hate crime victims from coming forward for fear that their allegations may be met with scepticism. He called upon the actor ""to apologise to this city that he smeared"". ""Celebrities, news commentators, and even presidential candidates weighed in on something that was choreographed by an actor,"" said Supt Johnson, with palpable anger. ""I'm left hanging my head and asking why,"" he added, describing Mr Smollett's actions as a ""slap in the face"" to Chicagoans. They dismissed Thursday's proceedings as ""an organised law enforcement spectacle that has no place in the American legal system"". A statement from the actor's legal team added: ""The presumption of innocence, a bedrock in the search for justice, was trampled upon at the expense of Mr Smollett and notably, on the eve of a mayoral election. ""Mr Smollett is a young man of impeccable character and integrity who fiercely and solemnly maintains his innocence and feels betrayed by a system that apparently wants to skip due process and proceed directly to sentencing."" Celebrity websites TMZ and Page Six saidthe actor was back on the set of Empire,externalafter the bail hearing. Rallies were held after Mr Smollett first announced the alleged ""attack"" The gay actor said he had gone out to buy food late at night on 29 January from a Subway sandwich shop in Chicago city centre when two white men hurled racial and homophobic insults at him. He said they also punched him, poured a chemical substance over him and put a rope around his neck. Mr Smollett also claimed the men had told him ""this is Maga country"", referring to President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan. An outpouring of support followed, including from Oscar winner Viola Davis and supermodel Naomi Campbell. In an interview last week with ABC's morning TV show, Mr Smollett tearfully said he had been ""forever changed"" by the alleged incident. Mr Smollett has been a vocal social activist for years But suspicions mounted as police were unable to find any video footage of the incident from over 50 surveillance cameras they reviewed. There were also no witnesses. Investigators managed to track and identify two men who appeared on video footage near where the actor said he had been attacked through a ride-sharing app. The men - Ola and Abel Osundairo - had left the US for Nigeria following the alleged attack and were held for nearly 48 hours after they returned last week. They were released without charges after providing information that ""shifted the trajectory of the investigation"", police said. One of the brothers is Mr Smollett's personal trainer and both have worked as extras on Empire, a hit Fox show that depicts the lives of a music mogul and his family in Chicago. Police say they have a cheque that Mr Smollett signed and that he had agreed to pay $3,500 for the brothers' participation. Supt Johnson said that Mr Smollett had told at least one of the brothers that he was ""dissatisfied"" with his salary from Fox. According to the Huffington Post,external, Mr Smollett was being paid $65,000 per episode for his starring role in Empire, which has about 18 episodes per season. Jussie Smollett (left) pictured in an episode of Empire Investigators said on Thursday that some minor scrapes on Mr Smollett's face were probably self-inflicted. Supt Johnson said Mr Smollett first ""attempted to gain attention by sending a false letter that relied on racial, homophobic and political language"" to himself at Fox studios. Police had confirmed in early February that white powder - later identified as aspirin - was in the letter. During another news conference on Thursday, police said Mr Smollett had also claimed that three days before the attack he received an unidentified phone call from a man who uttered a homophobic slur then hung up. He told police that incident happened near a surveillance camera. It was the same camera that police say Mr Smollett would later point out to the Osundairo brothers in preparation for the alleged hoax attack. On Wednesday, CBS Chicago obtained footage which appeared to show two people buying materials, including balaclavas, that had allegedly been worn by the actor's attackers. Mr Smollett turned himself in early on Thursday. Fox Entertainment and 20th Century Fox Television, which make Empire, issued a statement on Thursday saying they were ""evaluating the situation"" and ""considering our options."" In the aftermath of the attack, Democratic White House hopefuls Cory Booker and Kamala Harris both called the incident a ""modern-day lynching"". Ms Harris, a California senator, on Thursday said she was ""sad, frustrated, and disappointed"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Jailed gangster's trainers sold for Â£5K,"Four pairs of Christian Louboutin trainers each went for more than Â£250 Dozens of pairs of designer trainers that were seized after a gangster was arrested have sold for nearly Â£5,000 at auction. Isaiah Hanson-Frost is serving a six-year jail sentence for shooting a gun at a car containing rival gang members. The 55 pairs of trainers, were valued at about Â£18,500 and included brands such as Christian Louboutin, Louis Vuitton, Jimmy Choo and Gucci. The money raised will go towards helping to prevent crime. Lee Baldwin of AMS Auctions said the response was ""exceptional"", and the sale attracted bids from as fair afield as Australia, USA, Trinidad and Romania. He added: ""Based on our initial valuation of the shoes AMS are delighted with the sale result which has ensured a healthy return to the Gloucestershire constabulary in a transparent and justified manner."" These trainers are by the Italian designer Giacomo Morelli During a hearing last November, Hanson-Frost denied possession of criminal property but agreed to hand over his collection of trainers. Under the Police Property Act, the Gloucestershire force was able to auction off the trainers, which fetched Â£4,738. Hanson-Frost was jailed in Aprilafter admitting violent disorder and possessing a firearm with intent to cause fear of violence in relation to the shooting, which happened on the Chase Lane Industrial Estate in Gloucester.

Begum has 'right to return' to UK - Corbyn,"This video can not be played Corbyn: Begum has 'right to return' to UK Shamima Begum, who left the UK to join the Islamic State group in Syria aged 15, has a ""right to return to Britain"", Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said. Ms Begum has had her UK citizenship revoked by Home Secretary Sajid Javid - a move Mr Corbyn said was ""extreme"". The leader of the oppositiontold ITV News,externalthe 19-year-old should return to the UK to face questioning. Ms Begum toldSky News,externalon Thursday she was ""willing to change"" and called for ""mercy"" from British politicians. What is Shamima Begum's legal status? IS bride 'is not Bangladeshi citizen' 'I didn't want to be IS poster girl' UK nationals can only have their citizenship revoked if they are eligible for citizenship elsewhere. It is thought Ms Begum could be a Bangladeshi citizen because her mother is believed to be one. However, Bangladesh's ministry of foreign affairs has saidMs Begum is not a Bangladeshi citizenand there was ""no question"" of her being allowed into the country. Mr Corbyn, who iscurrently in Brussels to discuss his Brexit proposals, said: ""She obviously has, in my view, a right to return to Britain. ""On that return she must obviously face a lot of questions about everything she has done and at that point any action may or may not be taken. ""But I think the idea of stripping somebody of their citizenship when they were born in Britain is a very extreme manoeuvre indeed. ""Indeed, I questioned the right of the home secretary to have these powers when the original law was brought in by Theresa May when she was home secretary."" This video can not be played Shamima Begum: ""I got tricked and I was hoping someone would have sympathy with me"" Mr Javid has defended the move, which followed a debate over whether the teenager should be able to return to the UK after she was found in a Syrian refugee camp. Ms Begum, who left east London in 2015, said she never sought to be an IS ""poster girl"" and now simply wished to raise her child quietly in the UK. The home secretary said he would not leave an individual stateless, which is illegal under international law. But the Begum family's lawyer Tasnime Akunjee, who is preparing an appeal, has said he is considering whether she has been left stateless. Ms Begum gave birth to a boy in a Syrian refugee camp at the weekend, who the home secretary has suggested could still be British, despite the removal of Ms Begum's citizenship. ""Children should not suffer. So, if a parent does lose their British citizenship, it does not affect the rights of their child,"" he told the Commons. Ms Begum was 15 and living in Bethnal Green, London, when she left the UK in 2015 Mr Akunjee toldthe Guardian,externalhe planned to travel to the Syrian refugee camp ""as soon as possible"" to ask for Ms Begum's consent to bring her newborn son back to Britain, while her legal case is resolved. ""We can't do anything against her will, so I would hope that I would be able to outline the options for her, explain things to her,"" he said. But Ms Begum told Sky News her son was unwell and she would not allow him to travel to the UK without her. Ms Begum has previously said she had two children who both died.

MP charged with forgery on expenses claims,"Chris Davies unseated Liberal Democrat Roger Williams at the 2015 general election A Welsh Conservative MP has been charged in connection with allegations over false expenses claims. Chris Davies, MP for Brecon and Radnorshire, is accused of two offences of forgery and one of providing false or misleading information for allowance claims. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said he was due to appear before Westminster magistrates in March. It said the charges followed a review of evidence submitted by police. Mr Davies was elected in 2015, winning the seat from the Liberal Democrats, and successfully defended it at the 2017 election. A CPS spokesperson said: ""In November 2018, the Crown Prosecution Service received a file of evidence from the Metropolitan Police relating to an allegation that Christopher Davies, MP for Brecon and Radnorshire, falsified two invoices in support of Parliamentary expenses claims. ""Following a review of the evidence, the CPS has today charged Mr Davies with two offences of making a false instrument and one offence of providing false or misleading information for allowance claims. ""He will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 22 March."" The charges are: Forgery between 25 January 2016 and 11 March 2016 Forgery between 28 March 2016 and 12 April 2016 Providing false or misleading information for allowances claims between 6 and 11 March 2016. Mr Davies said: ""I am very disappointed at today's announcement by the CPS. ""I have explained previously the circumstances that led to the investigation, relating to events dating back to when I was a newly-elected MP over three years ago. ""I will now speak to my lawyers and my colleagues in Parliament. I have nothing further to say about the matter at this time.""

Corbyn's Labour 'an ally' - Jewish group,"A network of Jewish Labour members has backed Jeremy Corbyn over claims the party has become ""institutionally anti-Semitic"" under his leadership. Some 200 Labour supporters signed aJewish Voice for Labour letter,externalcalling Mr Corbyn's party a ""crucial ally in the fight against bigotry"". Anti-Semitism on the left is ""abhorrent but relatively rare"", it argues. The Board of Deputies of British Jews said the view ran ""counter to the experiences of Jewish Labour members"". On Wednesday, Labour front-bench MP Barry Gardiner made an emotional apology to Jewish people ""let down"" by the party. ""We will not stop working until we have once again become a safe and welcoming political home for people from the Jewish community as from every other,"" Labour's international trade spokesman told the Commons. Seven MPs leave Labour in Corbyn protest Labour: 673 anti-Semitism reports in 10 months Shadow cabinet clash over anti-Semitism Liverpool Wavertree MP Luciana Berger quit the party for the new Independent Group on Monday,saying she had been subjected to ""thousands of messages of anti-Semitic abuse and hate"". Telling MPs she had been met with ""obfuscation, smears, inaction and denial"" after raising the problem, Ms Berger said she arrived at the ""sickening conclusion"" that the Labour Party was ""institutionally anti-Semitic"". But the letter drafted by Jewish Voice for Labour, which describes itself as offering ""a space to explore and debate the many questions that are important to us as progressive Labour Jews"", rejects the suggestion. ""The Labour Party under the progressive leadership of Jeremy Corbyn is a crucial ally in the fight against bigotry and reaction,"" says the letter,published in the Guardian,external. ""His lifetime record of campaigning for equality and human rights, including consistent support for initiatives against anti-Semitism, is formidable. His involvement strengthens this struggle."" The group says the letter was signed by filmmaker Mike Leigh, writer Michael Rosen and author Gillian Slovo, as well as several academics and Walter Wolfgang, 93, who fled Nazi Germany as a child. It backs the Labour Party's endorsement of freedom of expression on Israel and on the rights of Palestinians. However, Board of Deputies President Marie van der Zyl said: ""The usual bunch of anti-Semitism deniers have written to the Guardian to declare that anti-Jewish hate in the Labour Party is rare."" She said the letter was ""particularly disrespectful"" to Ms Berger who had suffered ""years of anti-Semitic abuse, much of it from fellow party members"". ""This crisis will only be ended once the denial stops and Labour takes this problem seriously. Our community cannot have any confidence in Labour until the leadership commits to action."" Jewish Voice for Labour was formed in 2017 and has consistently backed Mr Corbyn's leadership. It is separate to the Jewish Labour Movement, formed in 1903, which has called extraordinary general meetings for 6 March, reportedly to discuss ending its 99-year affiliation with the Labour Party.

US officer 'made kill list of Democrats',"Guns and ammunition were found at the home in Silver Spring, Maryland A US Coast Guard officer has been arrested on suspicion of planning a terror attack, court documents show. Police found a cache of weapons and ammunition at the Maryland home of Christopher Paul Hasson. The self-proclaimed white nationalist had drawn up a list of targets including prominent Democratic politicians, according to prosecutors. He is said to have drawn inspiration from the Norwegian mass murderer Anders Breivik. ""The defendant intends to murder innocent civilians on a scale rarely seen in this country,"" US District Attorney Robert Hur said in the court documents, requesting that he be held in detention pending trial. Mr Hasson appeared in court on Thursday Mr Hasson is charged with unlawful possession of a firearm and controlled substances, but prosecutors say these ""current charges, however, are the proverbial tip of the iceberg"". ""The defendant is a domestic terrorist, bent on committing acts dangerous to human life that are intended to affect governmental conduct."" The 49-year-old is a lieutenant at Coast Guard headquarters in Washington and lives in the Maryland suburb of Silver Spring. The Coast Guard confirmed that a member of the service had been arrested, and said he was no longer employed at the agency's headquarters. Fifteen guns and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition were found in Mr Hasson's basement flat along with illegal drugs, the attorney's office said. Illegal drugs included human growth hormones and steroids, prosecutors say When agents raided his home, they discovered a locked case with more than 30 vials of human growth hormone, a steroid that prosecutors say he took thinking that it would ""increase his ability to conduct attacks"". Officials say he also had ordered more than 4,200 pills of the narcotic Tramadol since 2016, as well as synthetic urine in order to pass random drug tests at work. Prosecutors said that in a draft email from June 2017 Mr Hasson wrote: ""I am dreaming of a way to kill almost every last person on the earth. I think a plague would be most successful but how do I acquire the needed Spanish flu, botulism, anthrax, not sure yet but will find something."" A list of possible targets included Democratic House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democratic Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer as well as media personalities including MSNBC's Chris Hayes and Joe Scarborough. Since 2017 Mr Hasson had studied parts of a manifesto by Anders Breivik on how to amass firearms and compile a list of targets, prosecutors allege. Breivik murdered 77 people in 2011 in two terror attacks. He killed eight people with a car bomb in central Oslo and then shot dead 69 others, many of them teenagers, at a Labour Party camp. Mr Hanson was inspired to create his list by Breivik, prosecutors say. ""During unrest target both sides to increase tension,"" Mr Hasson wrote in one draft email. ""In other words provoke gov/police to over react which should help to escalate violence. BLM [Black Lives Matter] protests or other left crap would be ideal to incite to violence."" In another email to a white supremacist almost two months after a rally in Charlottesville which led to the death of a counter-protester, he wrote of his hope for a ""white homeland"". ""I never saw a reason for mass protest or wearing uniforms marching around provoking people with swastikas etc.,"" Hasson said in the letter, according to court filings. ""I was and am a man of action you cannot change minds protesting like that. However you can make change with a little focused violence."" Coast guard removed for 'white power sign' His internet search records showed he searched for the home addresses of members of Congress, including Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The New York City congresswoman on Wednesday criticised journalists for reporting on her new Washington DC apartment as Mr Hasson was allegedly plotting his attack against her and other lawmakers.

During court appearance on Thursday, Federal Magistrate Judge Charles Day ordered him to be held in detention for 14 days. After 14 days, the judge ruled, he can re-argue for his release unless more charges are filed against him. During the hearing, Mr Hasson's defence team argued that he should be released to his wife given his career of military service on behalf of the United States. According to CBS, his lawyers called his gun collection ""modest at best"" and said the charges were ""histrionic and ""without substance"". Allow Twitter content?

Begum family challenge Javid on citizenship,"This video can not be played Shamima Begum: ""I got tricked and I was hoping someone would have sympathy with me"" The family of Shamima Begum - who left the UK to join the Islamic State group in Syria - have told the home secretary they are going to challenge his decision to revoke her UK citizenship. In the letter to Sajid Javid,seen by the BBC, they say they ""cannot simply abandon her"". They also asked for assistance in bringing her newborn baby to the UK. Mr Javid said he has not read the letter yet but will be ""looking closely at it"". He added: ""Sadly, foreign fighters that have left our country to go and join a terrorist organisation, many of them will have taken children or had children there. ""Obviously all these children are perfectly innocent."" Ms Begum, who left Bethnal Green, east London in 2015, is living in a refugee camp in northern Syria and gave birth to a son last weekend. In an interview with the BBC on Monday, she said she did not regret travelling to Syria, though she added that she did not agree with everything the IS group had done. She told the BBC she was ""shocked"" by the 2017 Manchester Arena attack - which killed 22 people and was claimed by IS - but she also compared it to military assaults on IS strongholds by coalition forces, saying it was ""retaliation"". Begum family's letter in full Where now for IS bride Shamima Begum? Begum has 'right to return' to UK - Corbyn The letter, written by her sister Renu Begum on behalf of the family, says: ""We wish to make clear, that along with the rest of the country, we are shocked and appalled at the vile comments she has made to the media in recent days. ""These are not representative of British values, and my family entirely reject the comments she has made."" Renu Begum says the family made ""every fathomable effort"" to stop Shamima Begum from getting into Islamic State territory in 2015. ""That year we lost Shamima to a murderous and misogynistic cult. ""My sister has been in their thrall now for four years, and it is clear to me that her exploitation at their hands has fundamentally damaged her."" By home affairs correspondent Daniel Sandford Shamima Begum was 15 and living in Bethnal Green, London, when she left the UK in 2015 The letter from Renu Begum shows that Shamima Begum's family - who have stayed out of the spotlight for most of the week - are now prepared to take on the home secretary in the courts, and in the media. She is careful to stress how shocked they were by Shamima Begum's comments. But she is also equally vehement about how they cannot abandon her sister and how they ""must""  - to use their words - challenge his decision. The appeal for help in bringing Shamima Begum's baby son back to the UK will be one of the hardest parts of the letter politically for the Home Secretary Sajid Javid. He said in the House of Commons that the children of IS members would not lose their British citizenship. Renu Begum points out that Jarrar - who is not yet a week old - is the ""one true innocent"" in what they call the ""debacle"". In the letter, Renu Begum says none of the family has had any contact with Shamima, but they have watched her on television ""set fire to our nation's emotions"". She says they were ""sickened"" by Shamima's comments but hope Mr Javid understands that her family ""cannot simply abandon her"". The letter says: ""We have a duty to her, and a duty to hope that as she was groomed into what she has become, she can equally be helped back into the sister I knew, and daughter my parents bore. ""We hope you understand our position in this respect and why we must, therefore, assist Shamima in challenging your decision to take away the one thing that is her only hope at rehabilitation, her British citizenship."" The Home Office has said it is possible to strip the teenager of British nationality on the grounds that she is eligible for citizenship of another country - Bangladesh, through her mother, who is a Bangladeshi citizen. I have one citizenship, says IS bride What is Shamima Begum's legal status? Why countries face a dilemma over IS children However, Bangladesh's ministry of foreign affairs has saidMs Begum is not a Bangladeshi citizenand there was ""no question"" of her being allowed into the country. This video can not be played Geoffrey Robertson QC, one of the UK's most senior international lawyers says Shamima Begum should be put on trial in Britain The home secretary said he would not leave an individual stateless, which is illegal under international law. Mr Javid also suggested Ms Begum's child could still be British, despite the removal of Ms Begum's citizenship. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Javid's decision was ""extreme""and she had ""a right to return to Britain"". Geoffrey Robertson QC, a former United Nations judge, said it should be up to the UK courts to determine what punishment she should receive for joining a terrorist organisation. He told the BBC: ""It's surely for a judge to decide whether she deserves mercy or sympathy, not for a politician."" Begum has 'right to return' to UK - Corbyn What is Shamima Begum's legal status?

The killer caught by his mother's CCTV,"Tributes left outside Alesha's grandparents' home on Ardbeg Road, Rothesay ""I've found the wee girl.... she's dead."" Jorge Williams' voice trembled as he broke the devastating news to a 999 call handler. Less than half an hour had passed since he had answered a Facebook appeal to trace a missing six-year-old. It was one of the warmest summers on record and dozens of residents on the tranquil Isle of Bute took to the shoreline and streets. But the search ended abruptly at 08:54 when Mr Williams discovered Alesha's naked body in a wooded area near his home in Ardbeg. The little girl with the 'big beautiful smile' Detectives would later establish the child was abducted from her bed and carried to the lonely spot, less than a mile from her grandparents' flat in Rothesay. There, just days into her summer holiday, she was raped and murdered. A 16-year-old boy, who cannot be named because he is under 18,was found guilty of the crime. His conviction following a High Court trial in Glasgow would be the culmination of a police investigation which was helped in part by his own mother. Six-year-old Alesha MacPhail was only days into a summer break when she was murdered It was just after 6am on 2 July and Calum MacPhail was getting ready for work. He noticed the door to his granddaughter's room was open then discovered she had vanished. Giving evidence during the nine-day trial, Mr MacPhail told the jury: ""We searched under beds, in wardrobes, but there was no sign of her anywhere."" Alesha had never been missing before and her scooter and bike were still in the garden. At 06:23 the child's grandmother, Angela King, dialled 999. The family alerted staff at the ferry port and locals, including the volunteer Bute Resilience Team, joined the search. In an industrial estate near Glasgow Airport Police Scotland's Major Investigation Team was briefed on the case. Back on Bute Mr MacPhail became alarmed when he saw an ambulance speeding past with its blue light on. It came to a halt near the site of the old Kyles Hydropathic Hotel, which had been cordoned off. Ms King, 47, recalled a conversation with her partner in which he broke off to scream at officers: ""If that's my granddaughter up there then I want to know."" The family were advised to go to Rothesay Police Station for an update, and once inside they were told: ""We've found her, but she has passed."" The murder shocked the island community Alesha was lying on her side when she was discovered by Mr Williams and the killer had made no attempt to conceal her body. It was later calculated that the walking distance from the flat to the spot could be covered in between 15 to 17 minutes. Pathologist Dr John Williams established thecause of deathwas significant pressure being applied to the face and neck. The expert also told the court Alesha had 117 injuries, some of which he described as ""catastrophic"". Crucially, the soles of Alesha's feet were clean, which indicated she had been carried to her death. Detectives made a breakthrough just after midnight on 3 July from an unlikely source. The killer's mother had reviewed CCTV at the family home and spotted her son coming and going in the middle of the night. She believed he may have seen something and contacted the police. The mother quizzed her son and told the jury: ""He was adamant he had nothing to do with it. ""There was no way they would find his DNA because he had been nowhere near this little girl."" In the course of the investigation the killer's phone was forensically examined and experts established he had carried out a Google search for ""How do police find DNA?"" The six-year-old was staying at her grandparents' house before she disappeared Hours before Alesha was killed the boy had hosted a party for his friends which broke up at 00:30. At that point the accused was drunk and in a distressed state. To calm himself down he tried to buy cannabis but Alesha's father, whom he had obtained the drug from in the past, did not respond to his messages. At 01:54 the accused was spotted on CCTV leaving his family home. He went to the MacPhail's flat on Ardbeg Road and found that the key had been left in the lock. The killer entered the property and took Alesha out of bed without waking her or the four adults sleeping in rooms along the hall. The next footage of significance to the inquiry came from two houses on Marine Place. Between 02:25 and 02:26 they captured a figure walking along the shoreline carrying something. The CCTV trail then went cold until 03:35 when the accused was filmed arriving home. Ten minutes later he left wearing a pair of shorts, no top and no shoes. He returned at 03:52 and then departed again six minutes later wearing a grey T-shirt, dark shorts, dark footwear and carrying a torch. The accused arrived home for the final time at 04:07. Locals on Bute staged a candlelit vigil in memory of the schoolgirl The teenager's friends told the court he had a ""dark sense of humour"". The jury also heard evidence about aprivate conversationhe had had with a female friend in which he said he might kill one day for the ""lifetime experience"". A 16-year-old girl said he made the comment in a Facebook Messenger chat in 2017 after she started discussing a crime documentary. The same friend also said he contacted her just three hours after Alesha was found dead. She said: ""During the conversation he started to get anxious and he said the police were going to blame it on him."" In the hours after the body was found there was speculation about the crime on a Snapchat group the teenager was part of. During this time he produced a video in which he walked into his bathroom and then revealed his reflection in the mirror. It was accompanied by the caption: ""Found the guy who done it."" The court also heard the accused lifted weights and could bench press 50kg - more than double the 22kg Alesha weighed. Alesha MacPhail's uncle Calum described the child as the ""brightest thing"" In his defence, the 16-year-old claimed his DNA was planted at the crime scene, but the sheer volume of samples recovered left his astonishing alibi in tatters. Forensic scientist Stuart Bailey found theaccused's profileon intimate swabs taken from Alesha and on the front of her neck The odds of it being from anyone else were more than one in a billion. Additional samples were recovered on the child's body and clothing. Mr Bailey said it was ""highly unlikely"" they had got there through anything other than direct contact. Theaccused was arrestedat 5pm on 4 July and driven to Helen Street police station in Glasgow where he was formally charged with Alesha's murder. Despite what prosecutor Iain McSporran QC described as a ""mountain of evidence"" he compounded the family's agony by forcing them to endure a trial and blamed Alesha's father's girlfiend, Toni  McLachlan, for the crime. In a further twist, heagreed to testifyand dismissed suggestions he was a ""confident liar"". The accused repeatedly denied he was responsible and told the court: ""I have never met Alesha MacPhail."" The most memorable exchange came after Mr McSporran suggested it would have been ""extraordinarily wicked"" for Ms McLachlan to have murdered her boyfriend's daughter. The accused, who appeared completely unfazed by the enormity of the charge facing him, said: ""I agree."" The QC then put it to the 16-year-old that the same description would apply to someone who alleged an innocent person was responsible for such a crime.

Alesha: The little girl with the big smile,"Tributes to Alesha were left on the Isle of Bute alongside a school photograph of her A 16-year-old boy has been found guilty of the rape and murder of six-year-old Alesha MacPhail. Here we look at what happened in the hours before the brutal killing. When Alesha MacPhail went to bed for the last time she fell asleep watching Peppa Pig. The first day of July had been full of fun for the six-year-old, who was at the start of a three-week summer break on the Isle of Bute. She had travelled by ferry and car to a party on the mainland. And on returning at teatime she was taken to the park to play before watching YouTube videos on her grandmother's old phone until the battery ran out. The killer caught by his mother's CCTV Boy, 16, guilty of Alesha rape and murder Like most children her age Alesha was mischievous. During the 50-mile drive back from her home town of Airdrie to the ferry terminal in Wemyss Bay she annoyed her grandfather - Calum MacPhail - by repeatedly hitting a balloon onto the back of his head. But that night Alesha burst into his room, jumped on his bed and gave him a cuddle. The final words she said to him were: ""Goodnight, Grandpa."" The six-year-old was staying at her grandparents' house when she was abducted Alesha loved school and had just finished primary two. Wendy Davie, headteacher of Chapelside Primary in Airdrie, said the youngster enjoyed reading and was a perfectionist when it came to her writing. Ms Davie added: ""Alesha was a very considerate child who loved being part of a group and she was popular with all the other children and was a smiley and happy young girl."" Her teacher, Emma Gibson, said she had an infectious personality. Ms Gibson recalled: ""Alesha was a bright and bubbly little girl, she always came into class with that big beautiful smile of hers."" She was due to spend the first half of her summer holidays with her grandparents, her father Robert MacPhail, 26, and his 18-year-old girlfriend, Toni McLachlan. They all lived in a three-bedroom flat on Ardbeg Road in Rothesay, the main town on the island on Scotland's west coast. Alesha had her own room in the flat and a trampoline in the garden. This video can not be played The family of Alesha Macphail say their daughter dreamed of being a YouTube star. Robert and Alesha's mother, Georgina Lochrane, split up when she was three months old but the child travelled from Airdire to the island every second weekend. There was plenty to keep her occupied and the schoolgirl loved to go to the local swimming pool and for walks in the country. Her father told the jury: ""We were never in. We were always doing something."" Alesha dreamed of becoming a YouTube star and her mother later shared a video of the child vlogging about her love of pasta. The youngster was a gentle soul and left a lasting impression on those who met her. Her uncle, Calum MacPhail, said Alesha had a ""great amount of love for absolutely everyone"" and was ""the brightest thing"". Alesha MacPhail was remembered by her headteacher as a ""bright and bubbly"" girl When she arrived on Bute on Thursday 28 June Alesha wanted to go Highland dancing. But by the time they reached the 292 Club the class had finished. Instead, Alesha's grandparents, Calum MacPhail and Angela King, took her to the idyllic beach on Ettrick Bay. During the trial Calum recalled: ""She was in the water and having a great time."" The first major highlight of the holiday was Gala Day on 30 June. Calum said Alesha went on the children's train but especially enjoyed the donkey rides. The following day, 1 July, she and her grandfather headed from the island to a birthday party in Airdrie. But they arrived at the venue 24 hours late. Alesha's grandparents, Calum MacPhail and Angela King, gave evidence during the trial Fortunately, Alesha met a school friend and secured an invite to another celebration at the same place. Calum, 49, said: ""She was over the moon again. ""I don't think she knew the person at all but somebody she knew was attending the party."" They arrived back in Rothesay at about 5.30pm. The balloon she had used to hit her grandfather was let go and she chased it along the beach until it burst. During evidence at the murder trial, Angela, 47, recounted that special moment, telling the jury her granddaughter was a ""beautiful, beautiful, happy girl."" Bute is an island in the Firth of Clyde, easily accessible from the west of Scotland via a regular 35-minute ferry from Wemyss Bay in Inverclyde. It has a population of about 6,500 people and the main town is Rothesay. It established a reputation as a popular tourist destination in the Victorian era. Before package holidays and cheap air travel generations of holidaymakers from the Glasgow area made the trip ""doon the watter"" to Bute on a paddle-steamer. The island hit the headlines in 2003 when fashion designer Stella McCartney - daughter of Beatles icon Sir Paul McCartney - married Alasdhair Willis at Mount Stuart. At about 6.40pm Alesha was dropped in town to meet her father and his girlfriend who took her to a park. Angela picked them up two hours later and they drove home via a local supermarket. Back in the flat Alesha took a slice of the pizza her father was having for dinner. During the trial Angela was asked where Alesha was that night. She replied: ""Everywhere."" Robert MacPhail and his girlfriend Toni McLachlan with Alesha, aged six Just after 10pm Alesha's father Robert came out of his room and told his daughter to put away the phone she had been playing with. He said: ""Time for bed. You will never sleep."" But Alesha managed to keep the device for a few more minutes until the battery ran out. Calum was watching TV when he heard his granddaughter banging on the wall. Seconds later the child's father went into her room and put on a Peppa Pig DVD. Before he went to sleep Alesha's grandfather reminded Angela that a cartridge for the bubble machine they had bought Alesha as a surprise was due to be delivered the following day. Some time after 11pm Toni McLachlan went into the child's room to turn off her TV. This video can not be played Mourners wore pink in Alesha's memory Asked about their relationship, Toni, whom Alesha affectionately called Toto, told the jury: ""I loved her to pieces."" The teenager broke down as she recalled switching the TV off as the Peppa Pig theme tune played on the menu screen. Toni said: ""She was sleeping and her face was facing the wall and her hair was behind her on the pillow."" She closed the door and went to bed. The next person to open it, just a few hours later, was Alesha's 16-year-old killer.

"Boy, 16, guilty of Alesha rape and murderThe body of six-year-old Alesha MacPhail was found on the Isle of Bute after she was reported missing by her family.Scotland","This video can not be played Alesha MacPhail murder: Teenager found guilty A 16-year-old boy has been found guilty of the abduction, rape and murder of six-year-old Alesha MacPhail. Her naked body was found on the Isle of Bute after she was reported missing on the morning of 2 July last year. Alesha had suffered 117 injuries and died from significant pressure being applied to her face and neck. The teenager - who cannot be named because he is under 18 - was found guilty after a nine-day trial at the High Court in Glasgow. Judge Lord Matthews told the killer he had stolen Alesha's life by ""committing some of the most wicked and evil crimes this court has ever heard of in decades of dealing with depravity"". He said he had ""no idea"" why the teenager carried out the murder, and described the evidence in the case as ""overwhelming"". The killer caught by his mother's CCTV The little girl with the 'big beautiful smile' The jury took three hours to return its unanimous verdict. The boy showed no emotion as it was read out in court. In a witness impact statement, Alesha's mother Georgina Lochrane said her world had been ripped from her. She added that she ""had nightmares"" about what happened to her daughter. Alesha's mother Georgina Lochrane said her world had been ripped from her In a statement released after the verdict, Ms Lochrane, said: ""Words cannot express just how devastated I am to have lost my beautiful, happy, smiley wee girl. ""I am glad that the boy who did this has finally been brought to justice and that he will not be able to inflict the pain on another family that he has done to mine. ""Alesha, I love you so much, my wee pal. I will miss you forever."" Alesha's mother wrote a message which read: ""I love you more than this world"" Alesha's father Robert MacPhail said day-to-day life was ""almost impossible"". Prosecutor Iain McSporran QC, told the court the loss of a child would be hard to bear in any circumstance, but the ""bestial manner"" in which Alesha was murdered was ""simply unfathomable"". The boy, who faces detention without limit of time, will be sentenced on 21 March. The senior investigating officer on the case, Det Supt Stuart Houston, spoke outside the court. He said: ""Alesha's senseless and barbaric murder shocked the small community on Bute and people across Scotland. The effects of her death are still being felt today."" Det Supt Stuart Houston said the investigation had been ""challenging"" for police officers He added: ""Investigating any murder is challenging for all the police officers and staff involved. To be faced with the death of a little girl in such a cold and cruel way was extremely difficult for everyone. ""Crimes such as this are extremely rare and I am glad that we have been able to get justice for Alesha and her family."" Alesha was just days into a three-week holiday on Bute when she was taken from her grandparents' home on Ardbeg Road, Rothesay. Her grandparents, father and his girlfriend, who were sleeping in the flat, did not hear her being lifted from her bed. A major search was launched when the family woke to find that Alesha was missing. The six-year-old's body was found in the grounds of a former hotel on the island. Alesha's father Robert MacPhail and his girlfriend Toni McLachlan gave evidence in the trial Robert MacPhail and his girlfriend Toni McLachlan with Alesha, aged six The killer's own mother later alerted detectives after reviewing footage from two CCTV cameras outside the family home, which showed him coming and going three times between 01:54 and 04:07. Separate footage from two houses on Marine Place captured an eerie figure walking along the shoreline around 02:25. The individual appeared to be carrying something in front of them. A pathologist told the jury Alesha, who lived in Airdrie, North Lanarkshire, had no marks on her feet. This means she was carried to her death, a journey police estimate would have taken up to 17 minutes. DNA evidence linking the accused to the scene was also recovered on Alesha's body and on the clothes she had worn to bed. A forensic expert told the court the chances of the samples belonging to anyone other than the 16-year-old were more than one in a billion. The jury heard the teenager previously bought cannabis from Alesha's father, Robert MacPhail, but the pair fell out five months before her death over an unpaid Â£10 drug debt. At the start of the trial the accused lodged a special defence of incrimination blaming Mr MacPhail's girlfriend, Toni McLachlan, for the murder. The 18-year-old, who was the last person in the flat to see Alesha alive, denied having anything to do with the crime. It is illegal in Scotland to publish the name, address, school or any other information which could identify anyone under the age of 18 who is the accused, victim or witness in a criminal case This law applies to social media as well as to websites, newspapers and TV and radio programmes. Any violation is considered a serious contempt of court and could result in a fine or jail term. However, the name of victims who have died can be published - so the BBC and other outlets are able to identify Alesha MacPhail.

"Begum has 'right to return' to UK - CorbynThe Labour leader describes the decision to strip Ms Begum of her UK citizenship as ""very extreme"".UK","This video can not be played Corbyn: Begum has 'right to return' to UK Shamima Begum, who left the UK to join the Islamic State group in Syria aged 15, has a ""right to return to Britain"", Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said. Ms Begum has had her UK citizenship revoked by Home Secretary Sajid Javid - a move Mr Corbyn said was ""extreme"". The leader of the oppositiontold ITV News,externalthe 19-year-old should return to the UK to face questioning. Ms Begum toldSky News,externalon Thursday she was ""willing to change"" and called for ""mercy"" from British politicians. What is Shamima Begum's legal status? IS bride 'is not Bangladeshi citizen' 'I didn't want to be IS poster girl' UK nationals can only have their citizenship revoked if they are eligible for citizenship elsewhere. It is thought Ms Begum could be a Bangladeshi citizen because her mother is believed to be one. However, Bangladesh's ministry of foreign affairs has saidMs Begum is not a Bangladeshi citizenand there was ""no question"" of her being allowed into the country. Mr Corbyn, who iscurrently in Brussels to discuss his Brexit proposals, said: ""She obviously has, in my view, a right to return to Britain. ""On that return she must obviously face a lot of questions about everything she has done and at that point any action may or may not be taken. ""But I think the idea of stripping somebody of their citizenship when they were born in Britain is a very extreme manoeuvre indeed. ""Indeed, I questioned the right of the home secretary to have these powers when the original law was brought in by Theresa May when she was home secretary."" This video can not be played Shamima Begum: ""I got tricked and I was hoping someone would have sympathy with me"" Mr Javid has defended the move, which followed a debate over whether the teenager should be able to return to the UK after she was found in a Syrian refugee camp. Ms Begum, who left east London in 2015, said she never sought to be an IS ""poster girl"" and now simply wished to raise her child quietly in the UK. The home secretary said he would not leave an individual stateless, which is illegal under international law. But the Begum family's lawyer Tasnime Akunjee, who is preparing an appeal, has said he is considering whether she has been left stateless. Ms Begum gave birth to a boy in a Syrian refugee camp at the weekend, who the home secretary has suggested could still be British, despite the removal of Ms Begum's citizenship. ""Children should not suffer. So, if a parent does lose their British citizenship, it does not affect the rights of their child,"" he told the Commons. Ms Begum was 15 and living in Bethnal Green, London, when she left the UK in 2015 Mr Akunjee toldthe Guardian,externalhe planned to travel to the Syrian refugee camp ""as soon as possible"" to ask for Ms Begum's consent to bring her newborn son back to Britain, while her legal case is resolved. ""We can't do anything against her will, so I would hope that I would be able to outline the options for her, explain things to her,"" he said. But Ms Begum told Sky News her son was unwell and she would not allow him to travel to the UK without her. Ms Begum has previously said she had two children who both died.

US actor 'staged attack over salary',"This video can not be played Chicago Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson: ""Smollett dragged city's reputation through mud"" US actor Jussie Smollett staged a fake attack on himself because he was ""dissatisfied with his salary"", Chicago police say. Police Superintendent Eddie Johnson said in a news conference that he ""took advantage of the pain and anger of racism to promote his career"". Mr Smollett, 36, is charged with filing a false police report after he said he was the victim of a homophobic attack. Police say he also had sent a racist letter to himself at a Fox studio. On Thursday, Mr Smollett appeared in court and was ordered to submit a bond of $10,000 and surrender his passport. Judge John Fitzgerald Lyke called the charges ""utterly outrageous"" and ""despicable"" if true. The star of the TV series Empire is suspected of paying two brothers to stage the attack. They are both co-operating with the investigation, police say. On Wednesday his lawyers said they would ""mount an aggressive defence"". In a scathing news conference on Thursday, Supt Johnson accused the actor of committing a crime ""to further his own profile"". He said Mr Smollett had betrayed the city of Chicago, and said ""this publicity stunt was a scar that Chicago didn't earn and certainly didn't deserve"". The ""hoax"", he said, ""received national attention for weeks"", and may deter future hate crime victims from coming forward for fear that their allegations may be met with scepticism. He called upon the actor ""to apologise to this city that he smeared"". Mr Smollett turned himself in to police on Thursday ""Celebrities, news commentators, and even presidential candidates weighed in on something that was choreographed by an actor,"" he said, with palpable anger as he spoke. ""I'm left hanging my head and asking why,"" he said, describing Mr Smollett's actions as a ""slap in the face"" to Chicagoans. Suspicion over the actor's allegations started to grow after police said they could not find any video footage of the alleged incident from over 50 surveillance cameras they reviewed. There were also no witnesses. But investigators managed to track and identify two men who appeared on video footage near where the actor said he had been attacked through a ride-sharing app. Timeline of events 'I'm the gay Tupac' The men - Ola and Abel Osundairo - had left the US following the alleged attack and were held for nearly 48 hours after they returned last week. They were released without charges after providing information that ""shifted the trajectory of the investigation"", police said. One of the brothers is Mr Smollett's personal trainer and both have worked as extras on Empire, a hit Fox show that depicts the lives of a music mogul and his family in Chicago. CCTV image released earlier by Chicago police Police say they have a cheque that Mr Smollett signed and that he had agreed to pay $3,500 (Â£2,700) for the brothers' participation. Supt Johnson said that he had told at least one of the brothers that he was ""dissatisfied"" with his salary from Fox. He added that Mr Smollett first ""attempted to gain attention by sending a false letter that relied on racial, homophobic and political language"" to Fox studios. Police had confirmed in early February that a letter containing a white powder - later identified as aspirin - was included in the threatening letter that authorities now believe was now sent by the actor himself. During a news conference on Thursday, police said Mr Smollett had also claimed that three days before the attack he received an unidentified phone call from a man who uttered a homophobic slur then hung up. He told police the incident happened near a surveillance camera. It was the same camera that police say he would later point out to the Osundairo brothers in preparation for the alleged hoax attack. On Wednesday, CBS Chicago obtained footage which appeared to show two people buying materials, including ski masks, that had allegedly been worn by the actor's attackers. Mr Smollett turned himself in early on Thursday and is in custody of Chicago police. Rallies were held after Mr Smollett first announced the alleged ""attack"" The actor, who is gay, said he had gone out to buy food late at night in downtown Chicago when two white men hurled racial and homophobic insults at him. They allegedly punched the actor, poured a chemical substance over him and put a rope around his neck. Police said on Thursday that some minor scrapes on his face were probably self-inflicted. ""I'm left hanging my head and asking why. Why would anyone, especially an African-American man, use the symbolism of a noose to make false accusations?"" said Supt Johnson. ""How could someone look at the hatred and suffering associated with that symbol and see an opportunity to manipulate that symbol to further his own public profile?"" Mr Smollett also claimed the men had told him ""this is Maga country"", apparently referring to President Donald Trump's ""Make America Great Again"" slogan. The president tweeted his condemnation after the police news conference, slamming Mr Smollett's ""racist and dangerous comments"". Allow Twitter content?

'I had to sell my belongings to live',"Denise Edwards said she was forced to sell her jewellery to make up the Â£480 per month she lost when she was refused PIP A visually impaired woman said she had to sell her belongings to get by as she waited 17 months to appeal a decision to refuse her disability benefits. Helpline support worker Denise Edwards, 53, was left Â£480 a month out of pocket after she was refused the higher rate of Personal Independence Payment (PIP). Figures show one in 10 disabled people who challenged a PIP decision had to wait more than 10 months for money. The UK government said it was ""continuously improving the process"". Â£87m hole as almost a third of DLA claimants refused PIP PIP assessments: 'Lack of trust' in benefits systems PIPs: Benefit claimants share their stories The average delay to successfully appeal a PIP decision has more than doubled since 2014-15, a Freedom of Information request by BBC Wales has found. Campaigners claim the assessments process is flawed, with about72% of all PIP refusals overturned on appeal,external. Personal Independence Payment replaced Disability Living Allowance in 2013 PIP has been gradually replacing Disability Living Allowance (DLA) as the main benefit for disabled or ill people since the rollout started in 2013. It is worth up to Â£145.35 a week. It is designed to help towards the additional costs of a disability or long-term illness, such as help getting dressed, cooking meals or getting around. PIP claimants often have to facecontroversial assessments, conducted by private companies on behalf of the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP). The average wait for a successful appeal was 83 days in 2014-15, compared with 190 days in the first quarter of 2018-19. The DWP has so far only released first quarter figures for the current financial year. Average delays were shorter in Wales but one in 10 people waited more than a year to win back money they were initially denied, according to the figures obtained under the Freedom of Information Act. In Northern Ireland the Public Services Ombudsman is looking into ""a significant number of complaints"", pointing out thata ""high number"" of decisions on PIP applications have overturned. Government research suggests that 37% of people do not appeal the DWP's,externaldecision because ""the process would be too stressful"" while 20% said they were ""too unwell' to challenge it"". This video can not be played Sue Kemlo's daughter died before she was finally awarded PIP Ms Edwards, from Wrexham, is visually impaired and used a guide dog until recently. She said she lost about Â£480 per month after a decision to refuse her PIP in February 2017. Ms Edwards struggled for 17 months before her appeal was heard and she won. ""It was actually stated I had corrected vision in both eyes, when in fact I've only got one eye and very limited vision in the other eye,"" she said.

Brexit: Japan trade deal will be late,"This video can not be played Trade Secretary Liam Fox rejected calls to rule out a no-deal Brexit The UK won't be able to roll over an EU trade deal with Japan in time for a no-deal Brexit, Trade Secretary Liam Fox has said. It was one of the most important EU trade deals the UK hoped to replicate ahead of the 29 March withdrawal date. The trade department also said it would not be able to roll over the EU's customs union deal with Turkey on time. In 2017, Mr Fox said the UK would be able to replicate 40 EU free trade deals by Brexit day. But so far the department has only been able to finalise ""continuity agreements"" with seven of the 69 countries and regions with which the EU has trade deals. Brexit: What trade deals has the UK done so far? UK farmers promised 'no deal' tariff protection These include Switzerland, Chile, the Faroe Islands, Eastern and Southern Africa, Israel and the Palestinian Authority. The UK also has mutual recognition agreements signed with the US, Australia and New Zealand. Mr Fox, who was a prominent Leave campaigner, told the BBC: ""Of course, we will get access to all the EU's free trade agreements if we leave the EU with a deal, which is the government's policy, and for all those who don't want any disruption, there's one easy way to avoid that, which is to vote for the deal which the Prime Minister has."" Industry group the CBI said deals with Japan and Turkey not being concluded on time would be ""an unwelcome surprise"" for business. EU trade deals offer UK companies benefits like reduced tariffs on goods, enhanced access to markets for services and common standards on intellectual property. British exports to Japan are worth Â£9.9bn per year. ""Many companies are unaware it is not just their relationships with EU customers at risk from a no-deal Brexit, but those across the globe,"" said CBI director of international trade Ben Digby. ""Individual businesses trading with markets outside the EU would face tariffs worth millions of pounds being slapped on them instantaneously. ""It is vital no-deal is taken off the table to unlock transition, allowing the UK to remain part of these deals and provide space to agree new arrangements."" People's Vote supporter and Labour MP Stephen Doughty said: ""Brexiters promised that voting Leave would mean a bonanza of new international trade deals that would make up for lost trade with the EU. ""Instead, Brexit is costing us the global trade deals we already have as EU members. ""Liam Fox is now finally admitting that his promise to roll over all existing EU trade deals in time for Brexit is going to be broken."" What trade deals has the UK done so far? UK farmers promised 'no deal' tariff protection What does Australia have to do with Brexit?

The Monkees - Davy Jones, Micky Dolenz, Michael Nesmith and Peter Tork - were brought together for an American TV series in 1966. They were famous for their clean-cut image and were marketed as the American answer to The Beatles, notching up nine Top 40 hits. As well as playing instruments for the band, Tork also sang on many of the tracks. Among those to pay tribute on Thursday were Canadian singer-songwriter Ron Sexsmith and Blur guitarist and solo artist Graham Coxon, who simply tweeted: ""RIP Peter Tork - my favourite Monkee."" Award-winning songwriter Diane Warren, who contributed to the 80s hit Nothing's Gonna Stop Us Now by  Starship, tweeted ""Oh no"" and thanked Tork for ""giving me your love beads... when I was a little girl"". The post on Tork's Facebook told fans: ""We want to thank each and every one of you for your love, dedication and support of our 'boss.' ""Having you in our world has meant so very much to all of us. Please know that Peter was extremely appreciative of you, his Torkees, and one of his deepest joys was to be out in front of you, playing his music, and seeing you enjoy what he had to share. ""We send blessings and thoughts of comfort to you all, with much gratitude, the PTFB team."" Tork was born in Washington in 1942. He learned to play multiple instruments, including the piano and the French horn. As recently as October last year, he addressed ""some concerns"" about his health on Facebook. ""While it is true that my health has required a little more attention these days, I'm feeling pretty good,external,"" he wrote. The Monkees ran for just two television series, but that was enough to win an Emmy Award for outstanding comedy. Discussing the show in an interview with Guitar World in 2013, Tork said: ""I refute any claims that any four guys could've done what we did."",external He added: ""There was a magic to that collection... they got the right guys."" In 2012, following the death of Jones from a heart attack in February at the age of 66, Tork reunited with Nesmith and Dolenz for a US tour in what was the musicians' first live shows together in 15 years.

Purplebricks shares dive on sales shock,"Shares in estate agents Purplebricks plunged after it slashed its sales forecast and announced the departure of two senior executives. The company expects sales for the current financial year of between Â£130m and Â£140m. Its previous forecast was between Â£165m and Â£175m. Purplebricks blamed a ""challenging"" UK housing market and ""headwinds"" for its Australian business. The chief executives of the UK and US business will both be leaving. UK boss Lee Wainwright is leaving for ""personal reasons"". No reason was given for the departure of Eric Eckardt, the chief executive of the US business. Shares in Purplebricks dropped sharply on the news, falling as much as 40%, before recovering to close 24% lower on the day.. Housing market outlook worst 'for 20 years' Will the value of your home change in 2019? Calculator: Where can I afford to live? Purplebricks was launched by founder and chief executive Michael Bruce in April 2014. The idea was to create a lower cost, more flexible estate agent. It charges a fixed fee of Â£1,399 in London and surrounding areas to market a property. Elsewhere in the country it charges Â£899. Its agents, which Purplebricks calls local property experts, receive Â£200 when given a property to sell and Â£50 when the sale is completed. They also receive viewing fees of Â£399 in London and Â£300 outside. Agents can also win commissions for referring buyers to conveyancers and mortgage firms. The company has been expanding rapidly, but has seen losses grow as well. In the financial year which ended in April of last year it reported a loss of Â£26m, up from Â£6m in the previous year. In today's statement Mr Bruce said the company was in a good position to take advantage of growth potential in the UK, US and Australia, but added ""albeit not entirely as we would have wanted before our year end"". The problems at Purplebricks are a ""classic case of trying to do too much, too fast"", according to Russ Mould, investment director at AJ Bell. ""Success in the UK gave management confidence they could take over the world. Alas, that has proved nothing more than a pipe dream. ""Efforts to crack the US and Australia haven't resulted in the expected revenues and so the company has been forced to issue a profit warning. ""The overseas setbacks will be a huge embarrassment for the company, which has tried to be a pioneering force in the real estate sector."" Most experts expect the UK housing market to be sluggish this year. Uncertainty around Brexit is making buyers and sellers cautious, and there is also a shortage of new, affordable homes. In its most recent figures,externalthe Nationwide Building Society said house price growth had almost ground to a halt. In January, house prices were just 0.1% higher than the same period last year, Nationwide said. It said uncertainty over the economic outlook was affecting the confidence of buyers.

MP charged with forgery on expenses claimsA Welsh Conservative MP is charged in connection with allegations over making false expenses claims.Wales,"Chris Davies unseated Liberal Democrat Roger Williams at the 2015 general election A Welsh Conservative MP has been charged in connection with allegations over false expenses claims. Chris Davies, MP for Brecon and Radnorshire, is accused of two offences of forgery and one of providing false or misleading information for allowance claims. The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said he was due to appear before Westminster magistrates in March. It said the charges followed a review of evidence submitted by police. Mr Davies was elected in 2015, winning the seat from the Liberal Democrats, and successfully defended it at the 2017 election. A CPS spokesperson said: ""In November 2018, the Crown Prosecution Service received a file of evidence from the Metropolitan Police relating to an allegation that Christopher Davies, MP for Brecon and Radnorshire, falsified two invoices in support of Parliamentary expenses claims. ""Following a review of the evidence, the CPS has today charged Mr Davies with two offences of making a false instrument and one offence of providing false or misleading information for allowance claims. ""He will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 22 March."" The charges are: Forgery between 25 January 2016 and 11 March 2016 Forgery between 28 March 2016 and 12 April 2016 Providing false or misleading information for allowances claims between 6 and 11 March 2016. Mr Davies said: ""I am very disappointed at today's announcement by the CPS. ""I have explained previously the circumstances that led to the investigation, relating to events dating back to when I was a newly-elected MP over three years ago. ""I will now speak to my lawyers and my colleagues in Parliament. I have nothing further to say about the matter at this time.""

"Ban gas grid for new homes 'in six years'New-build homes should be warmed by heat pumps or networks of hot water, a report says.Science & EnvironmentComments","New homes should be banned from connecting to the gas grid within six years to tackle climate change, UK government advisers say. They want new-build homes in the countryside to be warmed by heat pumps - and cooking done on induction hobs, rather than using gas boilers and hobs. In cities, new housing estates and flats should be kept warm by networks of hot water, says the report. The water could be heated by waste heat from industry. An alternative approach is to use heat pumps, which draw warmth from the sea or lakes; or burn gas from waste. The report, from the independent Committee on Climate Change, recommends these changes are made to new homes at first because it's much more economical that way. They say it costs Â£4,800 to install low-carbon heating in a new home, but Â£26,300 in an existing house. What's more, these systems will only work if homes are insulated to the highest standards so they need little heating. It's the committee's job to lay down a pathway for the UK to meet its targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050 (on 1990 levels). They are dismayed that emissions from housing suddenly increased last year, when they should be going down. The housing emissions mainly came from heating boilers - a little-discussed source of greenhouse gases. The committee says that to meet climate targets, all homes in future will have to virtually eliminate emissions. The government said it's committed to investing Â£6bn to improve the energy efficiency of lower income and vulnerable households in a decade. Some 14% of UK greenhouse gas emissions come from our homes, but little's being done to reduce them. The committee's spokesperson Prof Julia King told us: ""This generation of home-owners is cheating its children by leaving homes which are completely inadequate for an age of climate change. ""They're too cold in winter and increasingly, as the climate continues to warm, they are going to become too hot in the summer."" Tackling existing housing stock is difficult and expensive in the short-term What's more, she said, many new homes don't even meet building standards because they are poorly constructed. ""These poorly-built new homes are going to need to be retro-fitted (re-insulated) 10-15 years down the line. It's a total waste of money because retro-fitting is 4-5 times more expensive than building it properly in the first place. ""This is a scandal comparable to the VW emissions scandal. Lots of people are paying far more on their gas bills than they ought to be because their new homes are poorly built."" Tackling existing housing stock is difficult and expensive in the short-term - though it saves on gas bills in the long term. The committee wants the government to treat renovating the UK's housing stock as a national infrastructure priority, akin to widening roads. ""There's already government cash for help-to-buy,"" said Prof King. ""That should be extended to help-to-insulate."" The report says upgrades and repairs to existing homes should include plans for shading and ventilation to combat the extreme heatwaves expected in future. They should also have measures to reduce indoor moisture, improve air quality, water efficiency and protection in homes at risk of flooding. ""The reason carbon emissions are rising again in homes is the decision by the Cameron government to slash funding for home energy efficiency,"" Ed Matthew, from the climate think tank E3G, told the BBC. ""As a result, home insulation has crashed by 95% since 2012. ""The chancellor must make building energy efficiency an infrastructure investment priority. Failure to do so will lead to entrenched fuel poverty, failure to meet carbon budgets, higher NHS costs and higher energy bills for us all."" The Treasury has typically been reluctant to invest in insulating private houses because it believes people who are able to pay should upgrade their homes without public money. ""They seem to have missed the memo on the climate emergency,"" Mr Matthew said. A government spokesperson said: ""The UK has reduced emissions faster than any other G7 nation, and moving to a greener, cleaner economy while continuing to grow the economy is at the heart of our modern Industrial Strategy. ""We will carefully consider the Committee's recommendations."" The chair of the Committee, Lord Deben, is being investigated by the Lords Standards Commissioner to see if he has breached rules by not declaring income from firms that benefit from pro-active climate policies. Lord Deben says he has followed advice on the rules.

New York City admits disaster-relief fraud,"Engineers from New York's Department of Environmental Protection assess the damage New York City will return $5.3m (Â£4m) to the US government after admitting in a settlement to fraudulently billing damage charges after Hurricane Sandy. Wednesday's settlement states that the city falsely claimed a number of Department of Transportation vehicles were damaged by the 2012 storm. Many of the vehicles had in fact been out of commission long before Sandy. City officials acknowledged they signed off on the claims without actually inspecting the vehicles. US Attorney Geoffrey Berman emphasised the government would always ""take decisive enforcement action"" to protect the Federal Emergency Management Agency's (Fema) money from ""fraud, waste and abuse"". ""When people lie to Fema about the cause of property damage in order to reap a windfall, it compromises Fema's ability to provide financial assistance to legitimate disaster victims in desperate need."" The New York City Department of Transportation (NYCDOT) had obtained the millions of dollars in Fema funds after claiming 132 vehicles were seriously damaged by the 29 October, 2012 storm. Over a dozen US states were affected by Hurricane Sandy. The total damage costs were $71bn,according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration,external(NOAA), making Sandy the fourth costliest hurricane on record. In 2012, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo estimated the state's damage amounted to over $32bn. In pictures: Recovery starts after Sandy Reality Check: Are hurricanes getting worse? The hidden costs of a hurricane Butaccording to federal prosecutors,external, NYCDOT officials ""made no effort to inspect the vehicles or otherwise determine whether any reported damage was attributable to Sandy"". The claims list included seven paving vehicles that the city had already classified as non-operational - some as early as 2009 - as well as trash equipment taken out of service in 2010. An NYCDOT employee notified the commissioner that some of the vehicles were not actually eligible for Fema funding in June 2014, but the city did not notify the federal agency until the official investigation. ""As a result of these false certifications, Fema paid the City millions of dollars to which it was not entitled,"" the complaint stated. The NYCDOT Deputy Commissioner who signed off on these fake claims ""lacked personal knowledge about the vehicles sufficient to make a certification about how and when they were damaged"", the government found. The commissioner also ""did not personally undertake or direct others to undertake any investigation of the vehicles prior to signing the certification"", and the city government failed to review any of the vehicle claims before submitting them to Fema. The city also failed to provide any training to employees responsible for submitting these claims on how the Fema programme worked. New York City will now return the funds it has used via a cash payment of $4.1m, and will not be awarded an additional $1.7m that had been previously approved by Fema. A judge must still approve the settlement. The US Attorney's statement also notes that the city withdrew some $3.1m in other requests during the course of the investigation, acknowledging ""the costs were ineligible for reimbursement"". Over 100 residents in the New York and New Jersey region have  been charged with similar instances of disaster-relief fraud in the years following Hurricane Sandy.

Gwyneth Paltrow sues over skiing accident,"Gwyneth Paltrow has counter-sued a retired optometrist who has taken legal action against her over a 2016 skiing accident. Last month 72-year-old Terry Sandersonsued Paltrowclaiming $3.1m [Â£2.36m] in damages. He said the actress knocked him down on a ski slope in Utah, leaving him with a brain injury and broken ribs. Paltrow's case says that he was at fault and his lawsuit is an ""attempt to exploit her celebrity and wealth"". She is seeking a symbolic $1 in damages. Mr Sanderson's lawsuit said the Oscar-winning-actress was skiing ""out of control"" when she hit him from behind on a beginner's slope on 26 February 2016. He said he was pushed into the snow and knocked unconscious, leaving him with a brain injury, short term memory loss and four broken ribs. He said he also experienced a personality change. Paltrow's 18-page case states that it was Sanderson who struck her from behind, delivering a ""body blow"", he then apologised to her and assured her that he was not hurt. It states ""she was enjoying skiing with her family on vacation in Utah"" when he ""ploughed into her back"". ""She was shaken and upset, and quit skiing for the day even though it was still morning,"" it says. ""He was not knocked out. Immediately after the collision, he stood up and addressed Ms Paltrow. Ms Paltrow expressed her anger that he ran into her, and he apologised."" The case says because her injuries ""were relatively minor, she seeks only symbolic damages in the amount of $1, plus her costs and attorneys' fees to defend this meritless claim"". It states that resolution of this counterclaim will demonstrate Sanderson ran into Ms Paltrow and ""nonetheless blamed her for it in an attempt to exploit her celebrity and wealth."" Bob Sykes, attorney for Mr Sanderson, responded to her lawsuit in a written statement to Reuters. ""The statement made by Ms Paltrow that Dr Sanderson hit her from behind is false,"" the statement said. ""Paltrow clearly hit Dr Sanderson from behind. Dr Sanderson was the downhill skier and had the right-of-way. It is unfortunate that Ms. Paltrow would fail to tell the truth about what happened."" The BBC put this statement to Paltrow's representative who said ""the counterclaim states her position"".

Pontins roof collapse 'like bomb going off',"About 100 people were in the entertainment hall about to play bingo when the roof collapsed People at a holiday camp where a ceiling collapsed have said it was like ""a bomb going off"". About 100 people were in the entertainment hall waiting to play bingo when sections of concrete fell down on Wednesday evening. Eighteen people needed treatment at the scene, including six who were taken to hospital following thecollapse at Pontins Brean Sands, Weston-super-Mare. A spokesperson for Pontins said they would not be commenting at the moment. An investigation is being led by Sedgemoor District Council. One of the injured people, Wendy Jones, from Hereford, was trapped under the debris in her motor scooter. The 67-year-old's daughter Hayley Kendle described the incident as ""horrific"". She said: ""I heard a crash, and next thing the ceiling was falling in on the building. She was under the rubble and they had to drag her out. People were screaming and shouting and yelling for us to get out of the building."" Mrs Jones suffered a broken hip and a suspected broken collarbone, and earlier underwent surgery at Weston General Hospital. Wendy Jones, from Hereford suffered a broken hip and a suspected broken collarbone Holidaymaker Jennifer McGary said: ""Our first reaction was that it was a terrorist attack. ""I know it sounds ridiculous but you just heard this loud noise that I can only describe as[like] a bomb going off. ""Suddenly it looked like the entire roof was collapsing - I just ran to grab my 11-year-old off the dance floor and my 15-year-old then tried to get out of there as quickly as I could. ""There were screaming children everywhere, people crying everywhere, there was a boy in a wheelchair outside who was calling for his mum."" Ms McGary added she felt the place ""should be shut down"". Eyewitnesses spoke of tables holding the collapsed ceiling up George Clark was injured by a falling piece of concrete that hit his shoulder. ""I had to throw myself to the ground, and crawl out under the tables - the tables were holding up the weight of the ceiling,"" he said.

""I wasn't worried about myself, I was worried about the kids - there were small babies in there, there were toddlers in there on the stage. ""There was dust everywhere,"" she added. Those at the scene said the area was filled with dust ""like a volcano"" A Sedgemoor council spokesman said the building was not owned by the authority. He added: ""We have environmental health officers at the site at present and will issue a further statement, based on their initial findings, but the investigation is likely to be complex and run for several months."" Officers from Somerset Building Control Partnership are also on site.

Fire in historic Dhaka district kills 78,"This video can not be played Deadly fire sweeps Dhaka historic district A fast-moving fire swept through a historic district of Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka, killing at least 78 people, officials say. The blaze broke out at night in a residential building that had flammable material stored on the ground floor. Members of a bridal party are thought to be among the victims. It is not yet clear what started the fire. The centuries-old Chawkbazar district has narrow streets and buildings very close to each other. Large building fires are relatively common in densely populated Bangladesh, owing to lax safety regulations and poor conditions. Hundreds of people have been killed in recent years. On Sunday,a fire in a slum in the coastal city of Chittagongkilled at least nine people. The fire broke out in a mixed-use building at 23:40 local time (17:40 GMT) on Wednesday, when many residents were sleeping. It started at a chemical warehouse on the ground floor and then raced through three other buildings, officials say. Many people were trapped, unable to escape the flames. Witnesses and police said gas explosions helped fuel the blaze. Volunteers recovering a body from a burnt warehouse Mohammad Firoz, who sells cosmetics in Chawkbazar, said 25 of his friends and relatives were missing and that he feared his brother was dead. He said he had seen an electricity transformer explode, causing a minibus parked below to catch fire. Its gas cylinder then exploded, causing a blaze in a nearby chemical shop. ""The flames spread so quickly,"" he told the BBC's Bengali service. He said his brother, Hira, who worked in a nearby pharmacy, closed the shutters of the shop after one of the explosions, fearing there had been a bombing. ""I fear he died inside the shop, I am still searching for his dead body."" Haji Abdul Kader, whose shop was destroyed, said he had ""heard a big bang"". He told AFP news agency: ""I turned back and saw the whole street in flames. Flames were everywhere."" Chawkbazar: The 400-year-old bustling heart of Dhaka The death toll stood at 78, Dr Sohail Mahmoud, head of the department of forensic medicine at Dhaka Medical College, told reporters. ""Up to now, we have 67 bodies in our mortuary and the hospital morgue has 11 dead bodies,"" he said. Victims included people outside the buildings, some guests at a restaurant and members of a bridal party, AFP reports. Most of the bodies were charred beyond recognition. Some of the injured were in critical condition. The number of victims is expected to rise as the search continues through the damaged buildings. Distraught relatives have been gathering at Dhaka Medical College hospital Firefighters fought for more than five hours to put out the blaze, hindered by narrow streets and a lack of water sources. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina expressed her shock over the tragedy and conveyed condolences to those affected, the Dhaka Tribune reports. By Rakib Hasnet, BBC Bengali Chawkbazar is one of the most important areas in Old Dhaka, a historic district established about 400 years ago during the Mughal dynasty. It is a hub of chemical businesses and local perfume factories, though authorities banned the storage of chemical goods after a deadly fire in 2010. The streets are packed with rickshaws, small cars and people walking around during the day. The lanes are so narrow that passenger buses cannot get through. Electrical, telephone and internet cables hanging above the narrow lanes pose a real danger. But the most serious threat comes from the fact that residential buildings are used for commercial purposes, with ground floors serving as chemical and gas cylinder warehouses. In June 2010, a blaze in the Nimtali district killed 124 people, a fire that was also made worse by the presence of an illegal chemicals warehouse. After that incident, a committee suggested the removal of all chemicals warehouses from residential areas, but critics say no significant steps have been taken in the years since. Bangladesh slum fire kills nine Just one week ago, authorities announced a campaign to identify illegal chemical business in old Dhaka. Similar campaigns have been conducted in the past but none of them were particularly successful. The scene of the fire in the crowded old quarter of Dhaka The lack of safety regulations was highlighted in 2013 when more than 1,100 people died and thousands more were injured when a building housing garment factories in Dhaka collapsed. Dhaka has a population of more than 18m people with some 3.5m living in slums, according to the World Bank. It is one of the world's most densely populated cities.

Swiss soldier on trial for fighting ISA former Swiss army officer is on trial for his part in fighting against Islamic State in Syria.Europe,"Former Swiss soldier Johan Cosar, photographed in Syria in 2015 A Swiss military court has sentenced a former soldier for fighting against the Islamic State group in Syria. Johan Cosar used his military training to recruit hundreds of men to defend Christian groups from IS. He was found guilty of undermining Switzerland's neutrality and security by joining a foreign army - and given a three-month suspended sentence and fined 500 francs (Â£383; $500). Cosar made no attempt to hide his actions, and remains proud of them. He says he plans to appeal the sentence - which is relatively lenient when compared to the maximum of three years in prison. He was born in Switzerland, and is a Swiss citizen. But his grandparents have Syrian roots, and the Cosar family are members of the Syriac Christian community. After returning from Syria, he was arrested and charged under Switzerland's military penal code, which forbids Swiss citizens from serving in foreign armies. The verdict reflects similar sentences handed down to other Swiss men over the last 10 years, most of whom joined the French Foreign Legion. At the outset of the trial, an army spokeswoman said: ""The law forbids fighting for a foreign force. Who that force actually is, is irrelevant."" Now 37, Cosar says he originally travelled to Syria to work as a freelance journalist, but when he saw that Islamist groups were advancing on Christian communities he felt he had no choice but to defend them. He helped to found the Syriac Military Council, recruited for it, and readily shared the military skills he had learned in the Swiss army, among them weapons training and setting up checkpoints. At the height of the fighting, he was in charge of more than 500 men. But joining a foreign army without the explicit permission of the government is forbidden under Switzerland's military penal code. Switzerland country profile Terror charges dropped against ex-soldier UK warns citizens over fighting against IS There are good historic reasons for this law: for centuries young Swiss men left their then-poor country to fight abroad. Swiss mercenaries were recruited by Napoleon, by Spain, the Netherlands, and even the British. But once Switzerland established itself as a neutral country, its government decided it could be awkward to have Swiss men fighting on multiple sides of Europe's wars, and forbade the practice. Today just one vestige of the Swiss mercenary tradition remains: the Swiss Papal Guard in Rome. Cosar - in his civilian clothes - arrives in court in Switzerland The opening of Cosar's trial was greeted by a small demonstration of his friends and family, carrying banners proclaiming ""fighting Islamic State is not a crime."" Cosar himself has suggested he deserves a medal, not a trial, because he was ""fighting terrorism"" and protecting Christian minorities in Syria from, he believes, certain death. The atmosphere inside the courtroom was described as relaxed. Switzerland's government, however, does not want to send a signal that fighting in foreign wars will be tolerated in any circumstances at all, however ""honourable"". Dozens of Swiss citizens have travelled to Syria to fight for IS, or to marry the Islamist group's soldiers. A few are already back and in prison. Others are still in northern Syria, together with thousands of other foreign fighters, detained in camps run by Syrian opposition groups. Like countries across Europe, Switzerland is agonising over what to do about them. Fighting for a banned group like IS carries a much stiffer prison sentence of up to 20 years. Switzerland's justice minister said this week she would like Swiss foreign fighters to be tried ""on the spot"" in Syria rather than back in Switzerland. No-one, however, seems quite sure how that would work. The Swiss government is due to announce its policy on foreign fighters next week.

What's it like to quit a party?,"What will the MPs who have quit their parties to form a new centrist group in Parliament be feeling right now? Scared? Relieved? Excited? Or filled with sadness and even a touch of regret? It was easy to see all of those emotions on display at the press conferences - two days apart - in which seven Labour MPs and then three Conservatives announced that they were quitting (the 11th member of the group, Joan Ryan, did not hold a press conference of her own). But the tone of the two events was different. The Labour defectors all spoke about what the Labour Party meant to them, how they had joined it as young people, filled with idealism and a desire to improve the lives of working people. But, they said, the party had changed beyond all recognition under Jeremy Corbyn and they could no longer be part of it. In other words: ""It's not me, it's you."" Three Tory MPs join breakaway group Eighth MP quits Labour for Independent Group Minor tremor or political earthquake? Mike Gapes: Labour to my core Mike Gapes - Labour MP for Ilford South since 1992 and a party member since 1968 - was, perhaps understandably, the most visibly moved by the occasion. ""I have always considered myself Labour to my core. I grew up in a working-class family, in a council house in Chigwell, in Essex,"" he told the audience. He spoke about his father, ""a postman and trade union branch secretary"", and how he had served the party ""at every level"" in his long career. Angela Smith spoke at length about her working-class parents and how as a young girl she had cheered for then Labour leader Harold Wilson in 1966, when the rest of the country had been cheering England on in the World Cup. Others were less sentimental about Labour. Chuka Umunna said he was fed up with the ""old tribal politics"", adding: ""You don't join a political party to spend years and years fighting the people in it."" Heidi Allen: I feel excited There were mixed emotions at the Conservative event too, with Anna Soubry clearly finding it difficult at times, but there was a lot of laughter too, and less talk about family and background. Heidi Allen, who opened the event, was upbeat and business-like, as if she was leaving a job rather than breaking up a family. ""I feel excited, so excited. In a way that I haven't felt since I was first elected - and a sense of liberation,"" said the former Tory MP, who described the breakaway group as the ""three Amigos"". Ms Allen does not have deep roots in the Conservative Party - she joined it in 2011 - after a successful career in business. The Conservative Party - rather than a creed or a way of life - had been a career choice for her, she said. And she had been inspired to ""serve my country"" by the 2011 London riots, having previously had no interest in politics. Like fellow defector, Sarah Wollaston Ms Allen was a product of David Cameron's efforts to open up the Conservative Party to a more diverse and interesting range of MPs, with real-life experience. Dr Wollaston, a GP, was the first Conservative MP to be selected in a US-style open primary, a postal ballot of everyone in her Totnes constituency, in 2009. Anna Soubry: A considerable amount of heartache Ms Allen also took part in an open primary, in South East Cambridgeshire, which she narrowly lost, before being selected to replace the retiring Andrew Lansley in South Cambridgeshire. Both have proved to be far too independent-minded for the Conservative Party whips, perhaps feeling they owe their first loyalty to their constituents rather than the party. And Dr Wollaston said she would not put herself forward as a Tory candidate now - because the party had changed so much. The open primary system, meanwhile, appears to have been dropped. And it was clear from Anna Soubry's speech that all three believe Mr Cameron's attempt to modernise the Conservative Party is equally dead in the water. Mr Cameron - in a rare public comment - said he had backed open primaries and he respected the decision of Dr Wollaston and Ms Allen to quit the party but he disagreed with them. ""We need strong voices at every level of the party calling for the modern, compassionate Conservatism that saw the Conservative Party return to office,"" said the former Tory leader. Anna Soubry told the Times Red Box podcast Mr Cameron made a last-ditch bid to try to stop the three from quitting, sending them a text saying: ""Is it too late to persuade you to stay?"" Ms Soubry - who first joined the Conservatives as a student in the 1970s - was more sentimental about the party, in her speech. ""You don't leave a political party you have called home, without a great deal of thought and a considerable amount of heartache,"" she said. But, she added, she had always been a member of the pro-EU ""one-nation"" Tory faction and now the party was entirely run by the ""awkward squad"" of hard Brexiteers in the European Research Group. What does Theresa May make of it all? The ERG, which is headed by Jacob Rees-Mogg, is arguably far more in tune with the Conservative Party membership - who, polls suggest, are a Eurosceptic bunch (although the defectors say this is because local branches are being ""infiltrated"" by former UKIP members). What Theresa May makes of all this is anybody's guess. As Tom McTaguepointed out in a piece for Politico,external, even her closest associates have trouble working out what she thinks. But she is someone who puts a high value on party loyalty. To a far greater extent, perhaps, than the MPs who have now walked out of it, the Conservative Party has been her life. She met her husband, Philip, at a Tory party dance, at Oxford University, and she is thought to do most of her socialising with fellow party members. Leaving a political party because you profoundly disagree with the direction it is taking might seem an obvious thing to do for those of us who have never been a member of one, let alone an MP. But it is not as straightforward as that for some.

The Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) said he was due to appear before Westminster magistrates in March. It said the charges followed a review of evidence submitted by police. Mr Davies was elected in 2015, winning the seat from the Liberal Democrats, and successfully defended it at the 2017 election. A CPS spokesperson said: ""In November 2018, the Crown Prosecution Service received a file of evidence from the Metropolitan Police relating to an allegation that Christopher Davies, MP for Brecon and Radnorshire, falsified two invoices in support of Parliamentary expenses claims. ""Following a review of the evidence, the CPS has today charged Mr Davies with two offences of making a false instrument and one offence of providing false or misleading information for allowance claims. ""He will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on 22 March.""

People were screaming and shouting and yelling for us to get out of the building."" Mrs Jones suffered a broken hip and a suspected broken collarbone, and earlier underwent surgery at Weston General Hospital. Wendy Jones, from Hereford suffered a broken hip and a suspected broken collarbone Holidaymaker Jennifer McGary said: ""Our first reaction was that it was a terrorist attack. ""I know it sounds ridiculous but you just heard this loud noise that I can only describe as[like] a bomb going off. ""Suddenly it looked like the entire roof was collapsing - I just ran to grab my 11-year-old off the dance floor and my 15-year-old then tried to get out of there as quickly as I could. ""There were screaming children everywhere, people crying everywhere, there was a boy in a wheelchair outside who was calling for his mum."" Ms McGary added she felt the place ""should be shut down"". Eyewitnesses spoke of tables holding the collapsed ceiling up George Clark was injured by a falling piece of concrete that hit his shoulder. ""I had to throw myself to the ground, and crawl out under the tables - the tables were holding up the weight of the ceiling,"" he said.

More MPs could quit Labour and Tories,"Heidi Allen (centre) is hopeful more MPs will join the breakaway Labour and the Conservatives could face more resignations, with members of the new Independent Group saying they expect more MPs to join them. Ex-Tory MP Heidi Allen told ITV's Peston programme ""a third"" of Tory MPs were fed up with the party's direction. Tory MP Justine Greening said she would quit in the event of a no-deal Brexit, saying she couldn't stay in a party that became ""simply a Brexit party"". MPs from the new group say they stand for ""the centre ground of politics"". The group was set up by eight defecting Labour MPs unhappy about their party's handling of Brexit and anti-Semitism. Who are the Independent Group and what do they want? What does it feel like to quit a party? Who are the MPs resigning? They were later joined by three pro-Remain Tories - Anna Soubry, Heidi Allen and Sarah Wollaston - who accuse the Conservative leadership of allowing right-wing hardliners to shape the party's approach to Brexit and other matters. Chancellor Philip Hammond told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was ""saddened"" by his former colleagues' comments, but hoped ""over time they will feel able to rejoin the party"". He denied their claims that the pro-Brexit European Research Group, headed by Jacob Rees-Mogg, was now running the party, dismissing them as a ""relatively small hardcore"", and insisting the Conservative Party was still a ""broad church"". Conservative MP and vice chairman of the European Research Group Mark Francois denied his group was a ""party within a party"" that had taken control, saying they were ""a group of Conservative MPs who are passionately committed to honouring the democratic decision of the British people that we should leave the EU"". He added: ""Conversely, Anna, Heidi and Sarah are now a party without a party, who are committed to precisely the opposite. As a result, we shall see how they get on."" Independent Group MP Sarah Wollaston has claimed a third of the cabinet would quit if there was a no-deal Brexit. Mr Hammond refused to rule out his own departure - but he said the threat of a no-deal Brexit had ""focused minds"" and was encouraging compromise. Justine Greening - a former education secretary - told the Today programme she tempted to break away from the party. ""It is something that I have considered, but I have reached a different conclusion for the moment,"" Ms Greening told Today. ""I don't think I would be able to stay part of a party that was simply a Brexit party that had crashed us out of the European Union."" This video can not be played ""I don't think I would be able to stay part of a party that was simply a Brexit party that had crashed us out of the EU"" Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve told BBC's Newsnight said he admired the courage of the breakaway group - and he would not be able to stay in the Conservative Party if it ""went completely off the rails"" and backed leaving the EU without a negotiated agreement. Labour's Ian Austin also expressed sympathy with the Independent Group's aims, saying he would think ""long and hard"" about his future in the Labour party. Shadow home Secretary Diane Abbott told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: ""I am very sad that the Labour members of this new independent organisation have gone. ""Up until the last minute, people were talking to them, trying to persuade them not to take the step they have taken."" She said she hoped they would continue to work with Labour on issues like homelessness, the benefit system, the NHS and ""most of all fighting this Tory Brexit"". Senior Conservatives have suggested the door is open for the three Tories who quit to return one day. But Ms Soubry insisted there was no ""going back"" because the soul of the party had been overwhelmed by a rightwing ""purple Momentum"" a reference to former UKIP members they claim are joining local Tory parties to de-select Remain-supporting MPs. She also revealed that former PM David Cameron had made a last-ditch attempt to stop the trio from quitting. Speaking to The Times Red Box podcast, she said Mr Cameron had sent them a text saying: ""Is it too late to persuade you to stay?"" This video can not be played What the three ex-Conservatives said about their departures What does it feel like to quit a party? Three Tory MPs join breakaway group Who are the MPs resigning? Ms Allen also said she could not imagine returning ""because if we do our jobs right there won't be a Tory party to go back to"". She said she was ""hopeful"" that what she described as ""good, sensible centre ground colleagues"" would join the new group. Meanwhile, in avideo released on Twitter,externalon Wednesday night, Labour leader Mr Corbyn said defecting Labour MPs should resign and put themselves up for election. He said this would be the ""democratic thing to do"" because they wanted to ""abandon the policies on which they were elected"". Momentum, the Labour movement backing Mr Corbyn, is to hold ""mass canvassing events"" in several constituencies with Independent Group MPs to build support in the event of any by-elections.

Vaughan Dowd left David Yamba, 10, ""terrified"" by writing ""No Blacks"" on the door of his family home in Salford, five days after they had moved in.

""I'm now constantly on edge and worried about every little noise outside and it has affected my ability to sleep."" Jackson Yamba and his son found the graffiti five days after moving into the flat in Salford Lorna Wincote, defending, said: ""The facts are fully accepted.

Trump: IS woman barred from US return,"US President Donald Trump says a woman who left the US to become a propagandist for the Islamic State (IS) group will not be allowed to return. On Twitter, he said he had instructed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo ""not to allow Hoda Muthana back into the country"". Mr Pompeo had earlier stated that the 24-year-old was not a US citizen and would not be admitted. However, her family and her lawyer maintain that she has US citizenship. Ms Muthana, who grew up in Alabama, travelled to Syria to join IS when she was 20. She had told her family she was going to a university event in Turkey. The case has similarities to that of UK-born teenager Shamima Begumwho has been stripped of her British citizenship. Ms Begum fled London to join IS in 2015 but has now said she wants to return to the UK.

"Trump: IS woman barred from US returnHoda Muthana, who was born in the US, regrets her actions and wants to return, her lawyer says.","US President Donald Trump says a woman who left the US to become a propagandist for the Islamic State (IS) group will not be allowed to return. On Twitter, he said he had instructed Secretary of State Mike Pompeo ""not to allow Hoda Muthana back into the country"". Mr Pompeo had earlier stated that the 24-year-old was not a US citizen and would not be admitted. However, her family and her lawyer maintain that she has US citizenship. Ms Muthana, who grew up in Alabama, travelled to Syria to join IS when she was 20. She had told her family she was going to a university event in Turkey. The case has similarities to that of UK-born teenager Shamima Begumwho has been stripped of her British citizenship.

City centres 'could become ghost towns',"City centres are in danger of becoming ghost towns as shopping habits change, a committee of MPs has warned. To combat this, the government should ""level the playing field"" for High Street retailers by raising taxes on online giants such as Amazon, it said. The MPs also called for lower business rates and more regeneration in town centres. The government said it was investing to ensure High Streets ""adapt and thrive for generations"". A fifth of UK retail sales now occur online with that proportion likely to grow, the Housing, Communities and Local Government Committee said. Replacing failed shops 'won't save cities' Three things that could save the High Street But it said the impact on high streets had been ""stark"", resulting in ""store closures, persistently empty shops and declining footfall"". ""Some formerly thriving shopping areas are likely to become ghost towns and effectively close down altogether unless the government, councils, retailers, landlords and the local community act together,"" it said. One problem, the committee said, was that High Street retailers paid much higher business rates than online retailers because of their greater reliance on physical premises. Amazon UK's rates, for example, are about 0.7% of its UK turnover, while most High Street retailers pay between 1.5% and 6.5%. To counter this, the MPs said the government should look again at bringing in an online sales tax - an idea the Treasury previously ruled out over concerns it would penalise consumers. The committee urged it to consider ""green taxes"" on online deliveries and packaging, as well as higher VAT and a general sales tax. The revenue raised would be put towards a reduction in business rates for High Street retailers and more funding for regeneration, it said. The committee also called for planning reforms to create more ""green spaces"" in city centres, as well as more leisure, culture and social care services. And it said High Street retailers themselves needed to focus on ""experience"" and ""convenience"" to lure shoppers back - for example by extending their opening hours. Amazon, which has massive sales in the UK,yet pays little tax, declined to comment on the MPs' proposals. But it stressed it paid all of the taxes required of it in the UK and ""every country where we operate"". Helen Dickinson, head of the British Retail Consortium, welcomed calls for lower business rates, saying the current system was ""a major factor in store closures"". High Streets Minister Jake Berry said the government had unveiled a Â£675m plan to support English High Streets at the last Budget. ""We know High Streets are the backbone of our economy and a crucial part of our local communities, and we want to see them thrive - both now and in the future. ""We're supporting small retailers too, slashing business rates by a third - building on more than Â£13bn of rates relief since 2016.""

Vaughan Dowd left David Yamba, 10, ""terrified"" by writing ""No Blacks"" on the door of his family home in Salford, five days after they had moved in. At Manchester Magistrates' Court, Dowd, of Irlam Square, Salford, admitted racially aggravated criminal damage. The 54-year-old has been kept in custody ""for his own protection"" until he is sentenced at Manchester Crown Court on 21 March.

Parkfield Community School assistant head teacher Andrew Moffat is in the running for the $1m (Â£770,000) prize. He has faced protests from some Muslim parents at the primary school. The shortlist was announced by X-Men actor Hugh Jackman, who said teachers were the ""real superheroes"". Mr Moffat has run a ""No outsiders"" project promoting equality and diversity in the school, including lessons about sexual identity and LGBT rights. This video can not be played LGBT-row teacher on teaching kids about equality This angered some parents, who earlier this term heldprotests outside the school, with some signing a petition against the project. Protesters said primary school children were too young for such lessons. But a statement from the school said it had a duty to protect pupils from harm, including homophobic or transgender bullying. Mr Moffat, who was awarded an MBE in 2017 for his services to equality and diversity in education, has been named in the latest shortlist for the annual Global Teacher Prize, run by the Varkey Foundation education charity. Parents protest in school LGBT row LGBT row teacher 'threatened' He was previously named in a top 50, which has now been narrowed to a top 10, with the winner to be announced next month. Mr Moffat was commended for his work in improving opportunities for pupils in a deprived part of Birmingham, in a school where most are from Muslim families and many speak another language at home. Hugh Jackman said teachers helped young people through ""insecurity and doubt"" His runs projects for pupils to ""meet others of different races, religions and cultures"". The Education Secretary, Damian Hinds, said the top 10 placing of Mr Moffat was ""another appropriate moment to thank all our teachers for their dedication and exceptional work, day after day, for our children and our society, in their unique role"". Announcing the finalists in a video message, Jackman said: ""I can tell you right now, from where I stand, with all my experience, the real superheroes are teachers - they're the ones that change the world. ""My favourite uncle was a teacher. My sister is a teacher. My brother is a teacher. And I have always felt the most important job in the world is teachers. ""All of us go through insecurity and doubt, trepidation along this journey of life. And those teachers that see the best in us and are patient enough to allow us to grow into that, they are like gold.""

Swiss soldier on trial for fighting IS,"Former Swiss soldier Johan Cosar, photographed in Syria in 2015 A Swiss military court has sentenced a former soldier for fighting against the Islamic State group in Syria. Johan Cosar used his military training to recruit hundreds of men to defend Christian groups from IS. He was found guilty of undermining Switzerland's neutrality and security by joining a foreign army - and given a three-month suspended sentence and fined 500 francs (Â£383; $500). Cosar made no attempt to hide his actions, and remains proud of them. He says he plans to appeal the sentence - which is relatively lenient when compared to the maximum of three years in prison. He was born in Switzerland, and is a Swiss citizen. But his grandparents have Syrian roots, and the Cosar family are members of the Syriac Christian community. After returning from Syria, he was arrested and charged under Switzerland's military penal code, which forbids Swiss citizens from serving in foreign armies. The verdict reflects similar sentences handed down to other Swiss men over the last 10 years, most of whom joined the French Foreign Legion. At the outset of the trial, an army spokeswoman said: ""The law forbids fighting for a foreign force. Who that force actually is, is irrelevant."" Now 37, Cosar says he originally travelled to Syria to work as a freelance journalist, but when he saw that Islamist groups were advancing on Christian communities he felt he had no choice but to defend them. He helped to found the Syriac Military Council, recruited for it, and readily shared the military skills he had learned in the Swiss army, among them weapons training and setting up checkpoints. At the height of the fighting, he was in charge of more than 500 men. But joining a foreign army without the explicit permission of the government is forbidden under Switzerland's military penal code. Switzerland country profile Terror charges dropped against ex-soldier UK warns citizens over fighting against IS There are good historic reasons for this law: for centuries young Swiss men left their then-poor country to fight abroad. Swiss mercenaries were recruited by Napoleon, by Spain, the Netherlands, and even the British. But once Switzerland established itself as a neutral country, its government decided it could be awkward to have Swiss men fighting on multiple sides of Europe's wars, and forbade the practice. Today just one vestige of the Swiss mercenary tradition remains: the Swiss Papal Guard in Rome. Cosar - in his civilian clothes - arrives in court in Switzerland The opening of Cosar's trial was greeted by a small demonstration of his friends and family, carrying banners proclaiming ""fighting Islamic State is not a crime."" Cosar himself has suggested he deserves a medal, not a trial, because he was ""fighting terrorism"" and protecting Christian minorities in Syria from, he believes, certain death. The atmosphere inside the courtroom was described as relaxed. Switzerland's government, however, does not want to send a signal that fighting in foreign wars will be tolerated in any circumstances at all, however ""honourable"". Dozens of Swiss citizens have travelled to Syria to fight for IS, or to marry the Islamist group's soldiers. A few are already back and in prison. Others are still in northern Syria, together with thousands of other foreign fighters, detained in camps run by Syrian opposition groups. Like countries across Europe, Switzerland is agonising over what to do about them. Fighting for a banned group like IS carries a much stiffer prison sentence of up to 20 years. Switzerland's justice minister said this week she would like Swiss foreign fighters to be tried ""on the spot"" in Syria rather than back in Switzerland. No-one, however, seems quite sure how that would work. The Swiss government is due to announce its policy on foreign fighters next week.

Actor charged with false attack report,"The actor is known for playing Jamal Lyon in Fox's drama Empire Chicago police say that US actor Jussie Smollett has been charged with filing a false police report. The Empire star had said he was subjected to a homophobic and racist physical attack by two men in January. Doubt was later cast on his account after US media reported that police believed he may have paid two Nigerian brothers to stage the attack. Mr Smollett's lawyers said they would ""conduct a thorough investigation and mount an aggressive defence"". On Wednesday a police spokesman said felony criminal charges had been approved against the actor. Mr Smollett had been charged for ""disorderly conduct / filing a false police report"",the spokesman, Anthony Guglielmi, said in a tweet,external. ""Detectives will make contact with his legal team to negotiate a reasonable surrender for his arrest."" Suspects held over attack on actor released Jussie Smollett performs after attack Lawyers Todd Pugh and Victor Henderson, who are representing the actor, said in a statement: ""Like any other citizen, Mr Smollett enjoys the presumption of innocence, particularly when there has been an investigation like this one where information, both true and false, has been repeatedly leaked."" They had previously said that Mr Smollett had ""been further victimised by claims... that Jussie played a role in his own attack. Nothing is further from the truth."" Chicago police earlier released this CCTV image of two ""people of interest"" in the case Earlier on Wednesday, CBS Chicago obtained footage which appeared to show the two brothers buying materials, including ski masks, that had allegedly been worn by the actor's attackers. The brothers, Ola and Abel Osundairo, left the US after the alleged attack and were arrested on their return last week. They were later released and are said to be co-operating with the investigation. One of the brothers is Smollett's personal trainer and both have worked as extras on Empire. Allow Twitter content?

Brits 2019: The real winners and losers,"This video can not be played Brit Awards 2019: the highlights It was a night of upsets, pirouettes and statuettes, as the 2019 Brit Awards took place at the O2 arena. The 1975 took home the top prize, album of the year, while George Ezra won best male and Jorja Smith grabbed best female. But the best bits aren't always on stage. So here's our selection of the real winners and losers at this year's ceremony. ""To be considered in the same category as David Bowie and the Beatles and Sir Elton and Sir Paul and Fleetwood Mac is beyond anything I can comprehend."" This video can not be played Christine and the Queens shows us her ""graceful loser"" face at the 2019 Brit Awards. Pop star Christine & The Queens didn't rate her chances against Cardi B and Ariana Grande in the best international female category. So much so that she'd practised her ""gracious loser"" pose ahead of the ceremony - which she displayed for us in the video above. ""To be honest,"" she said, ""every time I'm nominated for the Brits it already feels like I'm winning - because I'm French, baby!"" Allow Twitter content?

Jess Glynne's Thursday is a hymn to self-acceptance that shares its DNA with TLC's Unpretty and Christina Aguilera's Beautiful - and her staging of the song at the Brits was particularly powerful. The singer stared down the barrel of the camera, removing her fake eyelashes and wiping off eye make-up while singing the lyrics: ""I won't wear makeup on Thursday / 'Cause who I am is enough"". She was soon joined by dozens of other women, including US singer H.E.R, who simultaneously removed their make-up, and stood quietly in solidarity across the stage. In a night filled with bombastic, spectacular performances, this was the real show-stopper. The 1975 bag top awards at the Brits Brit Awards 2019: Full list of winners BBC Sounds - Exclusive Brits mix Hugh Jackman opened the Brits in style, playing circus impresario PT Barnum inside Britain's largest tent - as he delivered an elaborate performance of The Greatest Show -  from his hit musical The Greatest Showman. But the star delighted fans even more by giving the strongest hint yet that the film would be getting a sequel. ""For an actor, I'm a bad liar,"" he told the BBC. ""I have heard talk about it but I don't know. ""Honestly, that [the original] took eight years and you can't underestimate how hard it is to write a new musical.... ""At the same time, you're talking to the guy who made nine Wolverine movies."" Fingers and adamantium steel claws crossed, in that case. Poor old Anne-Marie was this year's Craig David - walking away from the Brits empty-handed after receiving an impressive four nominations. But she's had an incredible year with a gold album, two of the UK's Top 20 best-selling singles, and a support slot on Ed Sheeran's stadium tour. And she's not about to let the momentum get away from her. ""I've already finished my second album,"" she let slip on the red carpet, ""but don't tell anyone."" Explaining why she'd kept it under wraps, the star said: ""I didn't want anyone to hear anything about it because I felt like I was performing the first album for so long that everyone knew the songs. I wanted this album to be very different. I wanted it to be a surprise. ""I think I've told you too much,"" she giggled. ""I'm going to be in trouble."" With all those weepy break-up ballads in his catalogue, Samuel Frederick Smith doesn't get many chances to strut his stuff on stage. So it's no surprise he took full advantage of the opportunity to embrace his inner Madonna while performing Promises with Calvin Harris on Wednesday. After striking a series of cover girl-worthy poses inside a blue neon box; he cavorted around the stage with model Winnie Harlow, to all intents and purposes having the night of his life.

The Greatest Showman may have got the Brits off to a spectacular start; but our utmost admiration goes to the two men who had to sweep approximately 25 tons of glitter from the stage during the first ad break. Take note pop stars: That's a proper job. Standing at 6ft 4in, it's hard to miss fashion designer Daniel Lismore at the best of times; but he was extra-noticeable on Wednesday's red carpet thanks to an outfit we've christened ""Punch bowl jellyfish"". Described by Vogue Magazine as ""England's Most Eccentric Dresser"", he was also the clumsiest, and rounded off his red carpet experience by walking into a wall. ""This is a true story,"" said Years & Years star Emre Turkmen (above left). ""I'm pretty sure Jarvis wore some trousers that I recommended to him on the night he got on stage with Michael Jackson."" Wait... what? ""I'm not lying,"" he continued. ""I met Jarvis on the high street as a school child - I was coming home from school on the King's Road, I was a little fella - and I ran up to get his autograph. ""He said, 'Do you know anywhere I can get some funky trousers?' and I said, 'Kensington Market's just up the road' and he signed me an autograph, 'Thanks for the funky trousers, love Jarvis'. ""The next day he's on the Brits wearing funky trousers. It's true! I am a part of history."" Sam Fender had already endeared himself to us when he said he'd celebrate winning the Brits' Critics' Choice award by ""going on a double decker party bus and drinking til I vomit"" - but then he told us where he'd be keeping his trophy. ""On me mam's mantlepiece in the flat back home, next to a model of a highland cow she made herself,"" he explained jauntily. ""It looks like Satan and I'm going to have the Brit next to it.""

Ban gas grid for new homes 'in six years'Greenhouse gas emissions from your heating boiler are fuelling climate change.Science & EnvironmentComments,"New homes should be banned from connecting to the gas grid within six years to tackle climate change, UK government advisers say. They want new-build homes in the countryside to be warmed by heat pumps - and cooking done on induction hobs, rather than using gas boilers and hobs. In cities, new housing estates and flats should be kept warm by networks of hot water, says the report. The water could be heated by waste heat from industry. An alternative approach is to use heat pumps, which draw warmth from the sea or lakes; or burn gas from waste. The report, from the independent Committee on Climate Change, recommends these changes are made to new homes at first because it's much more economical that way. They say it costs Â£4,800 to install low-carbon heating in a new home, but Â£26,300 in an existing house. What's more, these systems will only work if homes are insulated to the highest standards so they need little heating. It's the committee's job to lay down a pathway for the UK to meet its targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050 (on 1990 levels). They are dismayed that emissions from housing suddenly increased last year, when they should be going down. The housing emissions mainly came from heating boilers - a little-discussed source of greenhouse gases. The committee says that to meet climate targets, all homes in future will have to virtually eliminate emissions. The government said it's committed to investing Â£6bn to improve the energy efficiency of lower income and vulnerable households in a decade. Some 14% of UK greenhouse gas emissions come from our homes, but little's being done to reduce them. The committee's spokesperson Prof Julia King told us: ""This generation of home-owners is cheating its children by leaving homes which are completely inadequate for an age of climate change. ""They're too cold in winter and increasingly, as the climate continues to warm, they are going to become too hot in the summer."" Tackling existing housing stock is difficult and expensive in the short-term What's more, she said, many new homes don't even meet building standards because they are poorly constructed. ""These poorly-built new homes are going to need to be retro-fitted (re-insulated) 10-15 years down the line. It's a total waste of money because retro-fitting is 4-5 times more expensive than building it properly in the first place. ""This is a scandal comparable to the VW emissions scandal. Lots of people are paying far more on their gas bills than they ought to be because their new homes are poorly built."" Tackling existing housing stock is difficult and expensive in the short-term - though it saves on gas bills in the long term. The committee wants the government to treat renovating the UK's housing stock as a national infrastructure priority, akin to widening roads. ""There's already government cash for help-to-buy,"" said Prof King. ""That should be extended to help-to-insulate."" The report says upgrades and repairs to existing homes should include plans for shading and ventilation to combat the extreme heatwaves expected in future. They should also have measures to reduce indoor moisture, improve air quality, water efficiency and protection in homes at risk of flooding. ""The reason carbon emissions are rising again in homes is the decision by the Cameron government to slash funding for home energy efficiency,"" Ed Matthew, from the climate think tank E3G, told the BBC. ""As a result, home insulation has crashed by 95% since 2012. ""The chancellor must make building energy efficiency an infrastructure investment priority. Failure to do so will lead to entrenched fuel poverty, failure to meet carbon budgets, higher NHS costs and higher energy bills for us all."" The Treasury has typically been reluctant to invest in insulating private houses because it believes people who are able to pay should upgrade their homes without public money. ""They seem to have missed the memo on the climate emergency,"" Mr Matthew said. A government spokesperson said: ""The UK has reduced emissions faster than any other G7 nation, and moving to a greener, cleaner economy while continuing to grow the economy is at the heart of our modern Industrial Strategy. ""We will carefully consider the Committee's recommendations."" The chair of the Committee, Lord Deben, is being investigated by the Lords Standards Commissioner to see if he has breached rules by not declaring income from firms that benefit from pro-active climate policies. Lord Deben says he has followed advice on the rules.

"Top cardinal Ã¢ÂÂfailed abuse victimsÃ¢ÂÂCardinal Oswald Gracias, the Archbishop of Mumbai, did not tell police of a child abuse allegation.India","Cardinal Oswald Gracias told the BBC it pained him to hear accusations that he had neglected victims of alleged abuse One of the Catholic Church's most senior cardinals has admitted that he could have better handled sexual abuse allegations that were brought to him. Oswald Gracias, the Archbishop of Mumbai is one of four men organising a major Vatican conference on child abuse this week. We found two separate cases where the cardinal, who is tipped by some to possibly become the next Pope, is claimed to have failed to respond quickly or offer support to the victims. Victims and those who supported them allege that Cardinal Gracias did not take allegations of abuse seriously when they were reported to him. India's Catholics say there is a culture of fear and silence in the Catholic Church about sexual abuse by priests. Those who have dared to speak out say it has been an ordeal. How will Pope Francis deal with abuse in the Catholic Church? US ex-cardinal Theodore McCarrick defrocked over abuse claims The first case dates back to 2015 in Mumbai. A woman's life changed when her son returned from Mass at the church and told her that the parish priest had raped him. ""I could not understand what should I do?"" she said. She did not know this yet, but this event would put her on a collision course with the Catholic Church in India. This video can not be played Why is India's Catholic church silent about sexual abuse? The man she reached out to for help was and remains one of the most senior representatives of the Church. It was nearly 72 hours after the alleged rape that the family briefly met Cardinal Gracias, then president of the Catholic Bishop's Conference of India and Federation of Asian Bishops' Conferences. The issue of sexual abuse within the Church is being called the Vatican's biggest crisis in modern times, and the integrity of the Catholic Church is said to ride on the outcome of this conference. Pope Francis with Cardinal Oswald Gracias (fourth from left) Over the past year, the Catholic Church has been reeling under multiple allegations of sexual abuse around the world. But while abuse claims have made headlines in North and South America, Europe and Australia, very little is known about the problems in Asian countries. In countries such as India there is a social stigma about reporting abuse. Among Christians, who are a minority of nearly 28 million people, a culture of fear and silence makes it impossible to gauge the true scale of the problem. Cardinal Blase Cupich of Chicago - a colleague of Cardinal Gracias on the four-member organising committee - has promised that decisive action in Rome and in dioceses worldwide will follow after the meeting so as to safeguard children and bring justice to the victims. Cardinal Gracias will open the second day of the summit with a conversation about accountability in the Church. This video can not be played Brigitte, a survivor of child sex abuse by a chaplain, explains why she is ready to speak now (From 2019) This vital role given to him during this crucial conference has made some in India unhappy. They say his track record in protecting children and women from abusers is questionable. Those we have spoken to who have taken cases to him say they received little support from him. The mother of the abused boy said: ""I told the cardinal about what the priest had done to my child, that my child was in a lot of pain. So he prayed for us and told us he had to go to Romeâ¦my heart was hurt in that moment. ""As a mother, I had gone to him with great expectations that he would think about my son, give me justice, but he said he had no time, he only cared about going to Rome."" The family say they requested medical help but were offered none. The cardinal told us it pained him to hear this, and that he was not aware that the boy needed medical help - and if he had been asked, he would have immediately offered it. The cardinal admits he left for Rome that night without alerting the authorities. By failing to call the police, Cardinal Gracias may have violated India's Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO). The provisions of this law state that if the head of any company or institution fails to report the commission of an offence in respect of a subordinate under his control, they shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, and with a fine. The cardinal told us he had telephoned his bishop the next day, who told him the family had subsequently informed the police themselves. Asked if he regretted not calling the police personally at the time, he said: ""You know I'm being honest, I'm not 100% sureâ¦ but I must reflect on that. I admit whether immediately, the police should have got involved, sure."" He says he was under a duty to evaluate the credibility of accusations by speaking to the accused man. Emerging from that meeting, the family decided to go to a doctor. ""He took one look at my boy and said that something has happened to him. This is a police case. Either you report it or I willâ¦ so we went to the police that night,"" the mother said. A police medical examination found that the child had been sexually assaulted. India is home to about 19 million Catholics A current priest who spoke to us on the condition of anonymity said this was not the first time allegations about this priest had been brought to the cardinal's attention. ""I met him some years before this [alleged] incident,"" the priest told us. ""There were strong rumours about [the accused priest] in the diocese, and like these are about abuse that is taking place. And yet he seems to be moving from one place to another, one parish to another. The cardinal told me directly that he is not aware directly of all these things."" The cardinal says he cannot recall the conversation. He says he did not recollect any ""cloud of suspicion"" over the man. As part of our investigation, we wanted to see if there were other allegations of the cardinal being slow to act. We found an instance dating back almost a decade, brought to his attention just a couple of years after becoming archbishop of Mumbai. Catholic activist Virginia Saldanha says three legal notices were sent to the cardinal, threatening court action unless took action about the claims of abuse In March 2009, a woman approached him with accusations of sexual abuse by another priest who conducted retreats. She says that he took no action against the priest so she reached out to a group of female Catholic activists, who say they forced the cardinal to act. Under pressure, he finally set up an enquiry committee in December 2011. Six months after the enquiry, there was still no action and the accused priest continued working in his parish. ""We had to send the cardinal three legal notices to act, threaten to take the matter to the courts if he did not act,"" said Virginia Saldanha, a devout Catholic who has worked on the women's desk of multiple Church-affiliated positions for over two decades. When the cardinal replied, he said: ""The priest is not listening to me."" The family says they have been ostracised from the church and isolated within their communities since reporting the sexual assault During the time, Saldanha said she had to leave the church because ""I could not bear to see that man giving Mass in the church. I did not feel like going there."" The priest was eventually removed from his parish, but the reasons for his departure were never made public. The punishment, decided by the cardinal personally in October 2011, was a ""guided retreat and therapeutic counselling"". When we pressed him about the speed of process and punishment, the cardinal said it was a ""complicated case"". After a stay in the seminary, the accused priest was briefly given a parish again and still conducts retreats. Meanwhile, the family of the allegedly raped minor feel abandoned by the institution that they had built their lives around. ""It has been a lonely battle,"" the mother concedes. They say they have been ostracised from the church and isolated within their communities. ""After complaining to the police, when we would go into church, people would refuse to talk to us, to sit next to us during Mass. If I went to sit next to someoneâ¦ they would get up and leave,"" she said. The hostility she encountered eventually ""made us leave the church. But it got so difficult for us that we eventually had to change our home as well. We left it all behind"". Church members say that it is this hostility that makes it harder for victims and their families to speak up. Caught between an apparently unsupportive clergy and hostile social network, many find their voices faltering.

Top cardinal Ã¢ÂÂfailed abuse victimsÃ¢ÂÂ,"Cardinal Oswald Gracias told the BBC it pained him to hear accusations that he had neglected victims of alleged abuse One of the Catholic Church's most senior cardinals has admitted that he could have better handled sexual abuse allegations that were brought to him. Oswald Gracias, the Archbishop of Mumbai is one of four men organising a major Vatican conference on child abuse this week. We found two separate cases where the cardinal, who is tipped by some to possibly become the next Pope, is claimed to have failed to respond quickly or offer support to the victims. Victims and those who supported them allege that Cardinal Gracias did not take allegations of abuse seriously when they were reported to him. India's Catholics say there is a culture of fear and silence in the Catholic Church about sexual abuse by priests. Those who have dared to speak out say it has been an ordeal. How will Pope Francis deal with abuse in the Catholic Church? US ex-cardinal Theodore McCarrick defrocked over abuse claims The first case dates back to 2015 in Mumbai. A woman's life changed when her son returned from Mass at the church and told her that the parish priest had raped him. ""I could not understand what should I do?"" she said. She did not know this yet, but this event would put her on a collision course with the Catholic Church in India. This video can not be played Why is India's Catholic church silent about sexual abuse? The man she reached out to for help was and remains one of the most senior representatives of the Church. It was nearly 72 hours after the alleged rape that the family briefly met Cardinal Gracias, then president of the Catholic Bishop's Conference of India and Federation of Asian Bishops' Conferences. The issue of sexual abuse within the Church is being called the Vatican's biggest crisis in modern times, and the integrity of the Catholic Church is said to ride on the outcome of this conference. Pope Francis with Cardinal Oswald Gracias (fourth from left) Over the past year, the Catholic Church has been reeling under multiple allegations of sexual abuse around the world. But while abuse claims have made headlines in North and South America, Europe and Australia, very little is known about the problems in Asian countries. In countries such as India there is a social stigma about reporting abuse. Among Christians, who are a minority of nearly 28 million people, a culture of fear and silence makes it impossible to gauge the true scale of the problem. Cardinal Blase Cupich of Chicago - a colleague of Cardinal Gracias on the four-member organising committee - has promised that decisive action in Rome and in dioceses worldwide will follow after the meeting so as to safeguard children and bring justice to the victims. Cardinal Gracias will open the second day of the summit with a conversation about accountability in the Church. This video can not be played Brigitte, a survivor of child sex abuse by a chaplain, explains why she is ready to speak now (From 2019) This vital role given to him during this crucial conference has made some in India unhappy. They say his track record in protecting children and women from abusers is questionable. Those we have spoken to who have taken cases to him say they received little support from him. The mother of the abused boy said: ""I told the cardinal about what the priest had done to my child, that my child was in a lot of pain. So he prayed for us and told us he had to go to Romeâ¦my heart was hurt in that moment. ""As a mother, I had gone to him with great expectations that he would think about my son, give me justice, but he said he had no time, he only cared about going to Rome."" The family say they requested medical help but were offered none. The cardinal told us it pained him to hear this, and that he was not aware that the boy needed medical help - and if he had been asked, he would have immediately offered it.

Parkfield Community School assistant head teacher Andrew Moffat is in the running for the $1m (Â£770,000) prize. He has faced protests from some Muslim parents at the primary school. The shortlist was announced by X-Men actor Hugh Jackman, who said teachers were the ""real superheroes"". Mr Moffat has run a ""No outsiders"" project promoting equality and diversity in the school, including lessons about sexual identity and LGBT rights. This video can not be played LGBT-row teacher on teaching kids about equality This angered some parents, who earlier this term heldprotests outside the school, with some signing a petition against the project. Protesters said primary school children were too young for such lessons. But a statement from the school said it had a duty to protect pupils from harm, including homophobic or transgender bullying. Mr Moffat, who was awarded an MBE in 2017 for his services to equality and diversity in education, has been named in the latest shortlist for the annual Global Teacher Prize, run by the Varkey Foundation education charity. Parents protest in school LGBT row LGBT row teacher 'threatened' He was previously named in a top 50, which has now been narrowed to a top 10, with the winner to be announced next month. Mr Moffat was commended for his work in improving opportunities for pupils in a deprived part of Birmingham, in a school where most are from Muslim families and many speak another language at home. Hugh Jackman said teachers helped young people through ""insecurity and doubt"" His runs projects for pupils to ""meet others of different races, religions and cultures"". The Education Secretary, Damian Hinds, said the top 10 placing of Mr Moffat was ""another appropriate moment to thank all our teachers for their dedication and exceptional work, day after day, for our children and our society, in their unique role"". Announcing the finalists in a video message, Jackman said: ""I can tell you right now, from where I stand, with all my experience, the real superheroes are teachers - they're the ones that change the world. ""My favourite uncle was a teacher. My sister is a teacher. My brother is a teacher. And I have always felt the most important job in the world is teachers. ""All of us go through insecurity and doubt, trepidation along this journey of life. And those teachers that see the best in us and are patient enough to allow us to grow into that, they are like gold."" The other finalists are from Georgia, Brazil, the Netherlands, India, the United States, Argentina, Australia, Japan and Kenya.

Pontins roof collapse 'like bomb going off'About 100 people were about to play bingo when the roof collapsed on to the entertainment hall.Somerset,"About 100 people were in the entertainment hall about to play bingo when the roof collapsed People at a holiday camp where a ceiling collapsed have said it was like ""a bomb going off"". About 100 people were in the entertainment hall waiting to play bingo when sections of concrete fell down on Wednesday evening. Eighteen people needed treatment at the scene, including six who were taken to hospital following thecollapse at Pontins Brean Sands, Weston-super-Mare. A spokesperson for Pontins said they would not be commenting at the moment. An investigation is being led by Sedgemoor District Council. One of the injured people, Wendy Jones, from Hereford, was trapped under the debris in her motor scooter. The 67-year-old's daughter Hayley Kendle described the incident as ""horrific"". She said: ""I heard a crash, and next thing the ceiling was falling in on the building. She was under the rubble and they had to drag her out. People were screaming and shouting and yelling for us to get out of the building."" Mrs Jones suffered a broken hip and a suspected broken collarbone, and earlier underwent surgery at Weston General Hospital. Wendy Jones, from Hereford suffered a broken hip and a suspected broken collarbone Holidaymaker Jennifer McGary said: ""Our first reaction was that it was a terrorist attack. ""I know it sounds ridiculous but you just heard this loud noise that I can only describe as[like] a bomb going off. ""Suddenly it looked like the entire roof was collapsing - I just ran to grab my 11-year-old off the dance floor and my 15-year-old then tried to get out of there as quickly as I could. ""There were screaming children everywhere, people crying everywhere, there was a boy in a wheelchair outside who was calling for his mum."" Ms McGary added she felt the place ""should be shut down"". Eyewitnesses spoke of tables holding the collapsed ceiling up George Clark was injured by a falling piece of concrete that hit his shoulder. ""I had to throw myself to the ground, and crawl out under the tables - the tables were holding up the weight of the ceiling,"" he said. ""Everyone just panicked, there were screams, kids crying and shouting, it was just bedlam in there."" Pontins Brean Sands: Ceiling collapse injures 18 Bristol misses second clean air zone response deadline Teacher asked boy for 'penis photo' Brothers jailed for 'barbaric' machete attack Sarah Prosser and her husband were also in the room when the ceiling fell. ""It was like a volcano - all of sudden it erupted,all smoke was thereand if I hadn't have moved a concrete slab would have landed on my head and split my head open."" ""I wasn't worried about myself, I was worried about the kids - there were small babies in there, there were toddlers in there on the stage. ""There was dust everywhere,"" she added. Those at the scene said the area was filled with dust ""like a volcano"" A Sedgemoor council spokesman said the building was not owned by the authority. He added: ""We have environmental health officers at the site at present and will issue a further statement, based on their initial findings, but the investigation is likely to be complex and run for several months."" Officers from Somerset Building Control Partnership are also on site. A spokesman for the Health and Safety Executive said: ""HSE has informed the police that this is a local authority enforced premises and therefore for the police and local authority to determine who will ultimately investigate.""

Indian cardinal Ã¢ÂÂfailed abuse victimsÃ¢ÂÂ,"Cardinal Oswald Gracias told the BBC it pained him to hear accusations that he had neglected victims of alleged abuse One of the Catholic Church's most senior cardinals has admitted that he could have better handled sexual abuse allegations that were brought to him. Oswald Gracias, the Archbishop of Mumbai is one of four men organising a major Vatican conference on child abuse this week. We found two separate cases where the cardinal, who is tipped by some to possibly become the next Pope, is claimed to have failed to respond quickly or offer support to the victims. Victims and those who supported them allege that Cardinal Gracias did not take allegations of abuse seriously when they were reported to him. India's Catholics say there is a culture of fear and silence in the Catholic Church about sexual abuse by priests. Those who have dared to speak out say it has been an ordeal. How will Pope Francis deal with abuse in the Catholic Church? US ex-cardinal Theodore McCarrick defrocked over abuse claims The first case dates back to 2015 in Mumbai. A woman's life changed when her son returned from Mass at the church and told her that the parish priest had raped him. ""I could not understand what should I do?"" she said. She did not know this yet, but this event would put her on a collision course with the Catholic Church in India. This video can not be played Why is India's Catholic church silent about sexual abuse? The man she reached out to for help was and remains one of the most senior representatives of the Church. It was nearly 72 hours after the alleged rape that the family briefly met Cardinal Gracias, then president of the Catholic Bishop's Conference of India and Federation of Asian Bishops' Conferences. The issue of sexual abuse within the Church is being called the Vatican's biggest crisis in modern times, and the integrity of the Catholic Church is said to ride on the outcome of this conference. Pope Francis with Cardinal Oswald Gracias (fourth from left) Over the past year, the Catholic Church has been reeling under multiple allegations of sexual abuse around the world. But while abuse claims have made headlines in North and South America, Europe and Australia, very little is known about the problems in Asian countries. In countries such as India there is a social stigma about reporting abuse. Among Christians, who are a minority of nearly 28 million people, a culture of fear and silence makes it impossible to gauge the true scale of the problem. Cardinal Blase Cupich of Chicago - a colleague of Cardinal Gracias on the four-member organising committee - has promised that decisive action in Rome and in dioceses worldwide will follow after the meeting so as to safeguard children and bring justice to the victims. Cardinal Gracias will open the second day of the summit with a conversation about accountability in the Church. This video can not be played Brigitte, a survivor of child sex abuse by a chaplain, explains why she is ready to speak now (From 2019) This vital role given to him during this crucial conference has made some in India unhappy. They say his track record in protecting children and women from abusers is questionable. Those we have spoken to who have taken cases to him say they received little support from him. The mother of the abused boy said: ""I told the cardinal about what the priest had done to my child, that my child was in a lot of pain. So he prayed for us and told us he had to go to Romeâ¦my heart was hurt in that moment. ""As a mother, I had gone to him with great expectations that he would think about my son, give me justice, but he said he had no time, he only cared about going to Rome."" The family say they requested medical help but were offered none. The cardinal told us it pained him to hear this, and that he was not aware that the boy needed medical help - and if he had been asked, he would have immediately offered it. The cardinal admits he left for Rome that night without alerting the authorities. By failing to call the police, Cardinal Gracias may have violated India's Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO). The provisions of this law state that if the head of any company or institution fails to report the commission of an offence in respect of a subordinate under his control, they shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, and with a fine. The cardinal told us he had telephoned his bishop the next day, who told him the family had subsequently informed the police themselves. Asked if he regretted not calling the police personally at the time, he said: ""You know I'm being honest, I'm not 100% sureâ¦ but I must reflect on that. I admit whether immediately, the police should have got involved, sure."" He says he was under a duty to evaluate the credibility of accusations by speaking to the accused man. Emerging from that meeting, the family decided to go to a doctor. ""He took one look at my boy and said that something has happened to him. This is a police case. Either you report it or I willâ¦ so we went to the police that night,"" the mother said. A police medical examination found that the child had been sexually assaulted. India is home to about 19 million Catholics A current priest who spoke to us on the condition of anonymity said this was not the first time allegations about this priest had been brought to the cardinal's attention. ""I met him some years before this [alleged] incident,"" the priest told us. ""There were strong rumours about [the accused priest] in the diocese, and like these are about abuse that is taking place. And yet he seems to be moving from one place to another, one parish to another. The cardinal told me directly that he is not aware directly of all these things."" The cardinal says he cannot recall the conversation. He says he did not recollect any ""cloud of suspicion"" over the man. As part of our investigation, we wanted to see if there were other allegations of the cardinal being slow to act. We found an instance dating back almost a decade, brought to his attention just a couple of years after becoming archbishop of Mumbai. Catholic activist Virginia Saldanha says three legal notices were sent to the cardinal, threatening court action unless took action about the claims of abuse In March 2009, a woman approached him with accusations of sexual abuse by another priest who conducted retreats. She says that he took no action against the priest so she reached out to a group of female Catholic activists, who say they forced the cardinal to act. Under pressure, he finally set up an enquiry committee in December 2011. Six months after the enquiry, there was still no action and the accused priest continued working in his parish. ""We had to send the cardinal three legal notices to act, threaten to take the matter to the courts if he did not act,"" said Virginia Saldanha, a devout Catholic who has worked on the women's desk of multiple Church-affiliated positions for over two decades. When the cardinal replied, he said: ""The priest is not listening to me."" The family says they have been ostracised from the church and isolated within their communities since reporting the sexual assault During the time, Saldanha said she had to leave the church because ""I could not bear to see that man giving Mass in the church. I did not feel like going there."" The priest was eventually removed from his parish, but the reasons for his departure were never made public. The punishment, decided by the cardinal personally in October 2011, was a ""guided retreat and therapeutic counselling"". When we pressed him about the speed of process and punishment, the cardinal said it was a ""complicated case"". After a stay in the seminary, the accused priest was briefly given a parish again and still conducts retreats. Meanwhile, the family of the allegedly raped minor feel abandoned by the institution that they had built their lives around. ""It has been a lonely battle,"" the mother concedes. They say they have been ostracised from the church and isolated within their communities. ""After complaining to the police, when we would go into church, people would refuse to talk to us, to sit next to us during Mass. If I went to sit next to someoneâ¦ they would get up and leave,"" she said. The hostility she encountered eventually ""made us leave the church. But it got so difficult for us that we eventually had to change our home as well. We left it all behind"". Church members say that it is this hostility that makes it harder for victims and their families to speak up. Caught between an apparently unsupportive clergy and hostile social network, many find their voices faltering.

US officer 'planned terror attack',"Guns and ammunition were found at the home in Silver Spring, Maryland A US Coast Guard officer has been arrested on suspicion of planning a terror attack, court documents show. Police found a cache of weapons and ammunition at the Maryland home of Christopher Paul Hasson. The self-proclaimed white nationalist had drawn up a list of targets including prominent Democratic politicians, according to prosecutors. He is said to have drawn inspiration from the Norwegian mass murderer Anders Breivik. ""The defendant intends to murder innocent civilians on a scale rarely seen in this country,"" US District Attorney Robert Hur said in the court documents, requesting that he be held in detention pending trial. Mr Hasson appeared in court on Thursday Mr Hasson is charged with unlawful possession of a firearm and controlled substances, but prosecutors say these ""current charges, however, are the proverbial tip of the iceberg"". ""The defendant is a domestic terrorist, bent on committing acts dangerous to human life that are intended to affect governmental conduct."" The 49-year-old is a lieutenant at Coast Guard headquarters in Washington and lives in the Maryland suburb of Silver Spring. The Coast Guard confirmed that a member of the service had been arrested, and said he was no longer employed at the agency's headquarters. Fifteen guns and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition were found in Mr Hasson's basement flat along with illegal drugs, the attorney's office said. Illegal drugs included human growth hormones and steroids, prosecutors say When agents raided his home, they discovered a locked case with more than 30 vials of human growth hormone, a steroid that prosecutors say he took thinking that it would ""increase his ability to conduct attacks"". Officials say he also had ordered more than 4,200 pills of the narcotic Tramadol since 2016, as well as synthetic urine in order to pass random drug tests at work. Prosecutors said that in a draft email from June 2017 Mr Hasson wrote: ""I am dreaming of a way to kill almost every last person on the earth. I think a plague would be most successful but how do I acquire the needed Spanish flu, botulism, anthrax, not sure yet but will find something."" A list of possible targets included Democratic House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democratic Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer as well as media personalities including MSNBC's Chris Hayes and Joe Scarborough. Since 2017 Mr Hasson had studied parts of a manifesto by Anders Breivik on how to amass firearms and compile a list of targets, prosecutors allege. Breivik murdered 77 people in 2011 in two terror attacks. He killed eight people with a car bomb in central Oslo and then shot dead 69 others, many of them teenagers, at a Labour Party camp. Mr Hanson was inspired to create his list by Breivik, prosecutors say. ""During unrest target both sides to increase tension,"" Mr Hasson wrote in one draft email. ""In other words provoke gov/police to over react which should help to escalate violence. BLM [Black Lives Matter] protests or other left crap would be ideal to incite to violence."" In another email to a white supremacist almost two months after a rally in Charlottesville which led to the death of a counter-protester, he wrote of his hope for a ""white homeland"". ""I never saw a reason for mass protest or wearing uniforms marching around provoking people with swastikas etc.,"" Hasson said in the letter, according to court filings. ""I was and am a man of action you cannot change minds protesting like that. However you can make change with a little focused violence."" Coast guard removed for 'white power sign' His internet search records showed he searched for the home addresses of members of Congress, including Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The New York City congresswoman on Wednesday criticised journalists for reporting on her new Washington DC apartment as Mr Hasson was allegedly plotting his attack against her and other lawmakers.

During court appearance on Thursday, Federal Magistrate Judge Charles Day ordered him to be held in detention for 14 days. After 14 days, the judge ruled, he can re-argue for his release unless more charges are filed against him. During the hearing, Mr Hasson's defence team argued that he should be released to his wife given his career of military service on behalf of the United States. According to CBS, his lawyers called his gun collection ""modest at best"" and said the charges were ""histrionic and ""without substance"". Allow Twitter content?

'Teach kids about same-sex couples',"This video can not be played LGBT equality teaching row: ""Protests won't change things"" All children must learn about same sex couples regardless of their religious background, the head of Ofsted says. Hundreds of parents protested outside a Birmingham school against it teaching pupils about same sex couples and gender identity. Ofsted chief inspector Amanda Spielman told the BBC it was crucial children were exposed to differences in society. She said it was important children knew ""there are families that have two mummies or two daddies"". Parents of Muslim and Christian faith haveheld demonstrations outside Parkfield Community Schoolin the Alum Rock area of the city, where children are taught about same sex couples through story books. Parkfield Community School said it has no plans to change its teaching, despite protests Protesters have claimed the lessons, part of the ""No Outsiders"" programme, contradict their faith. They argued assistant head Andrew Moffat, who started the lessons and is gay, has been ""promoting personal beliefs and convictions about universal acceptability of homosexuality as being normal and morally correct"". But Mrs Spielman said the lessons were ""about making sure they [children] know just enough to know that some people prefer not to get married to somebody of the opposite sex and that sometimes there are families that have two mummies or two daddies"". ""It's about making sure that children who do happen to realise that they themselves may not fit a conventional pattern know that they're not bad or ill."" In light of the protests, Mrs Spielman said there needed to be a ""careful exploration of the middle ground"" but lessons covering LGBT topics were important. Parents tied signs to railings outside the Birmingham primary school to protest LGBT lessons One mother, who wished to remain anonymous, accused the school of ""planting ideas"" in children's heads. Her daughter attends Parkfield School and she said she was too young to be taught ""what goes on in someone's bedroom"". ""It's something that we would like to teach our children ourselves,"" she said. ""It kind of feels like they're forcing it upon us."" She denied being homophobic but said ""it's just not what we're about and we don't agree with it"". Mr Moffat told the BBC he had beenreceiving threats and ""nasty emails""from parents who disagreed with the programme. Latest news from the West Midlands This video can not be played Parent speaks out over Birmingham school's LGBT equality teaching Mrs Spielman argued the lessons were less about ""endless sex education"" and more about understanding differences in society. ""The essence of democracy is that we don't all get our way,"" she said. ""We accept majority decision which means there will always be things that some of us don't like, but that is the very essence of it - accepting that we can't have 100% of what we want."" LGBT-row teacher in top 10 award How much do you know about LGBT history? Lost LGBT stories explored in exhibition Solutions, she said, would be found in ""sane, rational discussion, not protest"". However, the BBC understands more protests were being planned and some parents have said they would write to the government demanding a change in equality legislation.

"Indian cardinal Ã¢ÂÂfailed abuse victimsÃ¢ÂÂCardinal Oswald Gracias, the Archbishop of Mumbai, did not tell police of a child abuse allegation.India","Cardinal Oswald Gracias told the BBC it pained him to hear accusations that he had neglected victims of alleged abuse One of the Catholic Church's most senior cardinals has admitted that he could have better handled sexual abuse allegations that were brought to him. Oswald Gracias, the Archbishop of Mumbai is one of four men organising a major Vatican conference on child abuse this week. We found two separate cases where the cardinal, who is tipped by some to possibly become the next Pope, is claimed to have failed to respond quickly or offer support to the victims. Victims and those who supported them allege that Cardinal Gracias did not take allegations of abuse seriously when they were reported to him. India's Catholics say there is a culture of fear and silence in the Catholic Church about sexual abuse by priests. Those who have dared to speak out say it has been an ordeal. How will Pope Francis deal with abuse in the Catholic Church? US ex-cardinal Theodore McCarrick defrocked over abuse claims The first case dates back to 2015 in Mumbai. A woman's life changed when her son returned from Mass at the church and told her that the parish priest had raped him. ""I could not understand what should I do?"" she said. She did not know this yet, but this event would put her on a collision course with the Catholic Church in India. This video can not be played Why is India's Catholic church silent about sexual abuse? The man she reached out to for help was and remains one of the most senior representatives of the Church. It was nearly 72 hours after the alleged rape that the family briefly met Cardinal Gracias, then president of the Catholic Bishop's Conference of India and Federation of Asian Bishops' Conferences. The issue of sexual abuse within the Church is being called the Vatican's biggest crisis in modern times, and the integrity of the Catholic Church is said to ride on the outcome of this conference. Pope Francis with Cardinal Oswald Gracias (fourth from left) Over the past year, the Catholic Church has been reeling under multiple allegations of sexual abuse around the world. But while abuse claims have made headlines in North and South America, Europe and Australia, very little is known about the problems in Asian countries. In countries such as India there is a social stigma about reporting abuse. Among Christians, who are a minority of nearly 28 million people, a culture of fear and silence makes it impossible to gauge the true scale of the problem. Cardinal Blase Cupich of Chicago - a colleague of Cardinal Gracias on the four-member organising committee - has promised that decisive action in Rome and in dioceses worldwide will follow after the meeting so as to safeguard children and bring justice to the victims. Cardinal Gracias will open the second day of the summit with a conversation about accountability in the Church. This video can not be played Brigitte, a survivor of child sex abuse by a chaplain, explains why she is ready to speak now (From 2019) This vital role given to him during this crucial conference has made some in India unhappy. They say his track record in protecting children and women from abusers is questionable. Those we have spoken to who have taken cases to him say they received little support from him. The mother of the abused boy said: ""I told the cardinal about what the priest had done to my child, that my child was in a lot of pain. So he prayed for us and told us he had to go to Romeâ¦my heart was hurt in that moment. ""As a mother, I had gone to him with great expectations that he would think about my son, give me justice, but he said he had no time, he only cared about going to Rome."" The family say they requested medical help but were offered none. The cardinal told us it pained him to hear this, and that he was not aware that the boy needed medical help - and if he had been asked, he would have immediately offered it. The cardinal admits he left for Rome that night without alerting the authorities. By failing to call the police, Cardinal Gracias may have violated India's Protection of Children from Sexual Offences Act, 2012 (POCSO). The provisions of this law state that if the head of any company or institution fails to report the commission of an offence in respect of a subordinate under his control, they shall be punished with imprisonment for a term which may extend to one year, and with a fine. The cardinal told us he had telephoned his bishop the next day, who told him the family had subsequently informed the police themselves. Asked if he regretted not calling the police personally at the time, he said: ""You know I'm being honest, I'm not 100% sureâ¦ but I must reflect on that. I admit whether immediately, the police should have got involved, sure."" He says he was under a duty to evaluate the credibility of accusations by speaking to the accused man. Emerging from that meeting, the family decided to go to a doctor. ""He took one look at my boy and said that something has happened to him. This is a police case. Either you report it or I willâ¦ so we went to the police that night,"" the mother said. A police medical examination found that the child had been sexually assaulted. India is home to about 19 million Catholics A current priest who spoke to us on the condition of anonymity said this was not the first time allegations about this priest had been brought to the cardinal's attention. ""I met him some years before this [alleged] incident,"" the priest told us. ""There were strong rumours about [the accused priest] in the diocese, and like these are about abuse that is taking place. And yet he seems to be moving from one place to another, one parish to another. The cardinal told me directly that he is not aware directly of all these things."" The cardinal says he cannot recall the conversation. He says he did not recollect any ""cloud of suspicion"" over the man. As part of our investigation, we wanted to see if there were other allegations of the cardinal being slow to act. We found an instance dating back almost a decade, brought to his attention just a couple of years after becoming archbishop of Mumbai. Catholic activist Virginia Saldanha says three legal notices were sent to the cardinal, threatening court action unless took action about the claims of abuse In March 2009, a woman approached him with accusations of sexual abuse by another priest who conducted retreats. She says that he took no action against the priest so she reached out to a group of female Catholic activists, who say they forced the cardinal to act. Under pressure, he finally set up an enquiry committee in December 2011. Six months after the enquiry, there was still no action and the accused priest continued working in his parish. ""We had to send the cardinal three legal notices to act, threaten to take the matter to the courts if he did not act,"" said Virginia Saldanha, a devout Catholic who has worked on the women's desk of multiple Church-affiliated positions for over two decades. When the cardinal replied, he said: ""The priest is not listening to me."" The family says they have been ostracised from the church and isolated within their communities since reporting the sexual assault During the time, Saldanha said she had to leave the church because ""I could not bear to see that man giving Mass in the church. I did not feel like going there."" The priest was eventually removed from his parish, but the reasons for his departure were never made public. The punishment, decided by the cardinal personally in October 2011, was a ""guided retreat and therapeutic counselling"". When we pressed him about the speed of process and punishment, the cardinal said it was a ""complicated case"". After a stay in the seminary, the accused priest was briefly given a parish again and still conducts retreats. Meanwhile, the family of the allegedly raped minor feel abandoned by the institution that they had built their lives around. ""It has been a lonely battle,"" the mother concedes. They say they have been ostracised from the church and isolated within their communities. ""After complaining to the police, when we would go into church, people would refuse to talk to us, to sit next to us during Mass. If I went to sit next to someoneâ¦ they would get up and leave,"" she said. The hostility she encountered eventually ""made us leave the church. But it got so difficult for us that we eventually had to change our home as well. We left it all behind"". Church members say that it is this hostility that makes it harder for victims and their families to speak up. Caught between an apparently unsupportive clergy and hostile social network, many find their voices faltering.

Macron announces anti-Semitism crackdown,"President Macron was addressing the Representative Council of Jewish Institutions of France (CRIF) in Paris French President Emmanuel Macron has announced new measures to tackle anti-Semitism, following a spate of attacks. He told Jewish leaders that France would recognise anti-Zionism - the denial of Israel's right to exist - as a form of anti-Semitism. He also said parliament would vote on a new law to tackle hatred on the internet. On Tuesday Mr Macron visited a Jewish cemetery near Strasbourg where graves were desecrated with Nazi symbols. On the same day,thousands of people joined rallies across Francein support of the Jewish community. Anti-Semitism beneath the yellow vests? France warns of steep rise in anti-Semitism Addressing an annual meeting of Jewish organisations on Wednesday, Mr Macron said anti-Semitism in France and other Western countries had reached its worst levels since World War Two. Among a series of new measures, he said the government would act to dissolve three extreme-right groups - Bastion Social, Blood and Honour Hexagone and Combat 18 - which he said fuelled hatred and promoted discrimination. Mr Macron added: ""Anti-Zionism is one of the modern forms of anti-Semitism. This is why I'm confirming that France will put forward the definition of anti-Semitism as drawn by the International Holocaust Remembrance Alliance."" In recent months, France has witnessed a series of high-profile anti-Semitic attacks. This video can not be played French President Macron visits desecrated Jewish graves in February 2019 In the past week vandals defaced portraits of the late Holocaust survivor and French minister Simone Veil, scrawled the German word for ""Jews"" on a Parisian bakery and cut down a tree planted in memory of a Jewish youth tortured to death by an anti-Semitic gang. A prominent French philosopher, Alain Finkielkraut, was also verbally attacked for being Jewish as he walked past a recent ""gilets jaunes"" (yellow-vest) protest in Paris. During his visit to the Jewish cemetery in eastern France where nearly 100 graves were desecrated, President Macron said: ""Whoever did this is not worthy of the French republic and will be punished."" The number of anti-Semitic crimes reported in France, which is home to the largest Jewish population in Europe, increased by more than 70% - from 311 in 2017 to 541 last year. The tally is not the worst France has seen in the past two decades, and follows a two-year dip in attacks, BBC Paris correspondent Lucy Williamson reports. However, anti-Semitic violence is believed to be spreading from the old prejudices of the far-right, to radical Islamists and far-left groups, our correspondent adds.

Deadly fire sweeps historic Dhaka district,"This video can not be played Deadly fire sweeps Dhaka historic district A fast-moving fire swept through a historic district of Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka, killing at least 78 people, officials say. The blaze broke out at night in a residential building that had flammable material stored on the ground floor. Members of a bridal party are thought to be among the victims. It is not yet clear what started the fire. The centuries-old Chawkbazar district has narrow streets and buildings very close to each other. Large building fires are relatively common in densely populated Bangladesh, owing to lax safety regulations and poor conditions. Hundreds of people have been killed in recent years. On Sunday,a fire in a slum in the coastal city of Chittagongkilled at least nine people. The fire broke out in a mixed-use building at 23:40 local time (17:40 GMT) on Wednesday, when many residents were sleeping.

By Rakib Hasnet, BBC Bengali Chawkbazar is one of the most important areas in Old Dhaka, a historic district established about 400 years ago during the Mughal dynasty. It is a hub of chemical businesses and local perfume factories, though authorities banned the storage of chemical goods after a deadly fire in 2010. The streets are packed with rickshaws, small cars and people walking around during the day. The lanes are so narrow that passenger buses cannot get through. Electrical, telephone and internet cables hanging above the narrow lanes pose a real danger. But the most serious threat comes from the fact that residential buildings are used for commercial purposes, with ground floors serving as chemical and gas cylinder warehouses. In June 2010, a blaze in the Nimtali district killed 124 people, a fire that was also made worse by the presence of an illegal chemicals warehouse. After that incident, a committee suggested the removal of all chemicals warehouses from residential areas, but critics say no significant steps have been taken in the years since.

CO2 emissions from UK housing 'go up',"New homes should be banned from connecting to the gas grid within six years to tackle climate change, UK government advisers say. They want new-build homes in the countryside to be warmed by heat pumps - and cooking done on induction hobs, rather than using gas boilers and hobs. In cities, new housing estates and flats should be kept warm by networks of hot water, says the report. The water could be heated by waste heat from industry. An alternative approach is to use heat pumps, which draw warmth from the sea or lakes; or burn gas from waste. The report, from the independent Committee on Climate Change, recommends these changes are made to new homes at first because it's much more economical that way. They say it costs Â£4,800 to install low-carbon heating in a new home, but Â£26,300 in an existing house. What's more, these systems will only work if homes are insulated to the highest standards so they need little heating. It's the committee's job to lay down a pathway for the UK to meet its targets for reducing greenhouse gas emissions by 80% by 2050 (on 1990 levels). They are dismayed that emissions from housing suddenly increased last year, when they should be going down. The housing emissions mainly came from heating boilers - a little-discussed source of greenhouse gases. The committee says that to meet climate targets, all homes in future will have to virtually eliminate emissions. The government said it's committed to investing Â£6bn to improve the energy efficiency of lower income and vulnerable households in a decade. Some 14% of UK greenhouse gas emissions come from our homes, but little's being done to reduce them. The committee's spokesperson Prof Julia King told us: ""This generation of home-owners is cheating its children by leaving homes which are completely inadequate for an age of climate change. ""They're too cold in winter and increasingly, as the climate continues to warm, they are going to become too hot in the summer."" Tackling existing housing stock is difficult and expensive in the short-term What's more, she said, many new homes don't even meet building standards because they are poorly constructed. ""These poorly-built new homes are going to need to be retro-fitted (re-insulated) 10-15 years down the line. It's a total waste of money because retro-fitting is 4-5 times more expensive than building it properly in the first place. ""This is a scandal comparable to the VW emissions scandal. Lots of people are paying far more on their gas bills than they ought to be because their new homes are poorly built."" Tackling existing housing stock is difficult and expensive in the short-term - though it saves on gas bills in the long term. The committee wants the government to treat renovating the UK's housing stock as a national infrastructure priority, akin to widening roads. ""There's already government cash for help-to-buy,"" said Prof King. ""That should be extended to help-to-insulate."" The report says upgrades and repairs to existing homes should include plans for shading and ventilation to combat the extreme heatwaves expected in future. They should also have measures to reduce indoor moisture, improve air quality, water efficiency and protection in homes at risk of flooding. ""The reason carbon emissions are rising again in homes is the decision by the Cameron government to slash funding for home energy efficiency,"" Ed Matthew, from the climate think tank E3G, told the BBC. ""As a result, home insulation has crashed by 95% since 2012. ""The chancellor must make building energy efficiency an infrastructure investment priority. Failure to do so will lead to entrenched fuel poverty, failure to meet carbon budgets, higher NHS costs and higher energy bills for us all."" The Treasury has typically been reluctant to invest in insulating private houses because it believes people who are able to pay should upgrade their homes without public money. ""They seem to have missed the memo on the climate emergency,"" Mr Matthew said. A government spokesperson said: ""The UK has reduced emissions faster than any other G7 nation, and moving to a greener, cleaner economy while continuing to grow the economy is at the heart of our modern Industrial Strategy. ""We will carefully consider the Committee's recommendations."" The chair of the Committee, Lord Deben, is being investigated by the Lords Standards Commissioner to see if he has breached rules by not declaring income from firms that benefit from pro-active climate policies. Lord Deben says he has followed advice on the rules.

May sees progress in EU backstop talks,"Theresa May arriving in Brussels to meet European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker Theresa May has said progress has been made in talks about changes to the Brexit deal that could win MPs' backing but admitted ""time is of the essence"". The PM met the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels to discuss legally-binding guarantees over the Irish border. Earlier, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said ""small but important"" changes to the backstop would allay MPs' concerns it could be trapped in a customs union. But Home Secretary Sajid Javid said the chances of a no-deal exit had risen. Speaking on ITV's Peston show, Mr Javid said it was ""fair to say that in the past few weeks the probability of a no-deal Brexit has gone up"". The prime minister is trying to renegotiate the backstop - the insurance policy to prevent the return of physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It is the most contentious part of the withdrawal agreement Mrs May agreed with the EU in November, which was rejected by Parliament by a large margin last month. Adler: UK expectations meet EU reality on Brexit Tories 'manipulated by Brexit zealots' Brexit: A really simple guide Critics fear the backstop - which could be activated if the two sides do not settle their future partnership by the end of 2020 and choose not to extend the transition period - would leave the UK tied to a customs union indefinitely and see Northern Ireland treated differently. The EU has consistently said it will not reopen discussions over the withdrawal agreement agreed in November. Mrs May said the two sides had made progress and that she had made it clear MPs would only accept guarantees that had similar legal force to the agreement. ""We have agreed that work to find a solution will continue at pace, time is of the essence and it is in both our interests that when the UK leaves the EU it does so in an orderly way,"" she said. This video can not be played Confused by Brexit jargon? Reality Check unpacks the basics. The EU said the discussions, which are also focusing on the use of technology, were constructive but the timing was ""tight"". On a visit to Germany earlier, Mr Hunt warned the greatest threat to Brexit was ""defeatism"" over getting a deal through Parliament. Speaking after talks with his German counterpart in Berlin, Mr Hunt said it would be a ""disaster"" for both sides if the UK left the EU without a negotiated agreement on 29 March. But he said the risk of ""paralysis"" in the process was equally damaging to business. Amid speculation that Mrs May could put the deal to Parliament again as soon as next week, Mr Hunt said the role of Attorney General Geoffrey Cox would be vital in the unfolding process. Mr Cox, who will also be in Brussels for talks later this week, told MPs in December that although the agreement stipulated the backstop would be temporary and only apply until the two sides settled their future relationship, there was no way for the UK to leave it without the approval of EU member states. MPs gave their backing for Mrs May to renegotiate the policy in a vote earlier this month although many remain unconvinced that the EU can be forced to change its position. But Mr Hunt said the government was confident, on the basis of discussions with Conservatives and some Labour MPs, that if the issue was resolved then the deal would pass. ""The critical thing is that Geoffrey Cox needs to be able to change his advice to Parliament,"" he said. ""The current text uses the word temporary to describe the backstop, so what we need to do is put some flesh on the bone of what temporary actually means,"" he said. ""I think... with political will and conviction we can find a way to solve that problem."" How Brexit hit the pound in your pocket Brexit: Will Britons in the EU still get healthcare?

Religion 'cannot stop LGBT education',"This video can not be played LGBT equality teaching row: ""Protests won't change things"" All children must learn about same sex couples regardless of their religious background, the head of Ofsted says. Hundreds of parents protested outside a Birmingham school against it teaching pupils about same sex couples and gender identity. Ofsted chief inspector Amanda Spielman told the BBC it was crucial children were exposed to differences in society. She said it was important children knew ""there are families that have two mummies or two daddies"". Parents of Muslim and Christian faith haveheld demonstrations outside Parkfield Community Schoolin the Alum Rock area of the city, where children are taught about same sex couples through story books. Parkfield Community School said it has no plans to change its teaching, despite protests Protesters have claimed the lessons, part of the ""No Outsiders"" programme, contradict their faith. They argued assistant head Andrew Moffat, who started the lessons and is gay, has been ""promoting personal beliefs and convictions about universal acceptability of homosexuality as being normal and morally correct"". But Mrs Spielman said the lessons were ""about making sure they [children] know just enough to know that some people prefer not to get married to somebody of the opposite sex and that sometimes there are families that have two mummies or two daddies"". ""It's about making sure that children who do happen to realise that they themselves may not fit a conventional pattern know that they're not bad or ill."" In light of the protests, Mrs Spielman said there needed to be a ""careful exploration of the middle ground"" but lessons covering LGBT topics were important. Parents tied signs to railings outside the Birmingham primary school to protest LGBT lessons One mother, who wished to remain anonymous, accused the school of ""planting ideas"" in children's heads. Her daughter attends Parkfield School and she said she was too young to be taught ""what goes on in someone's bedroom"". ""It's something that we would like to teach our children ourselves,"" she said. ""It kind of feels like they're forcing it upon us."" She denied being homophobic but said ""it's just not what we're about and we don't agree with it"". Mr Moffat told the BBC he had beenreceiving threats and ""nasty emails""from parents who disagreed with the programme. Latest news from the West Midlands This video can not be played Parent speaks out over Birmingham school's LGBT equality teaching Mrs Spielman argued the lessons were less about ""endless sex education"" and more about understanding differences in society. ""The essence of democracy is that we don't all get our way,"" she said. ""We accept majority decision which means there will always be things that some of us don't like, but that is the very essence of it - accepting that we can't have 100% of what we want."" LGBT-row teacher in top 10 award How much do you know about LGBT history? Lost LGBT stories explored in exhibition Solutions, she said, would be found in ""sane, rational discussion, not protest"".

Deadly fire sweeps Dhaka historic district,"This video can not be played Deadly fire sweeps Dhaka historic district A fast-moving fire swept through a historic district of Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka, killing at least 78 people, officials say. The blaze broke out at night in a residential building that had flammable material stored on the ground floor. Members of a bridal party are thought to be among the victims. It is not yet clear what started the fire. The centuries-old Chawkbazar district has narrow streets and buildings very close to each other. Large building fires are relatively common in densely populated Bangladesh, owing to lax safety regulations and poor conditions. Hundreds of people have been killed in recent years. On Sunday,a fire in a slum in the coastal city of Chittagongkilled at least nine people. The fire broke out in a mixed-use building at 23:40 local time (17:40 GMT) on Wednesday, when many residents were sleeping. It started at a chemical warehouse on the ground floor and then raced through three other buildings, officials say. Many people were trapped, unable to escape the flames.

"US officer 'planned terror attack'The white nationalist planned to ""murder civilians on a scale rarely seen"" in the US, prosecutors say.US & Canada","Guns and ammunition were found at the home in Silver Spring, Maryland A US Coast Guard officer has been arrested on suspicion of planning a terror attack, court documents show. Police found a cache of weapons and ammunition at the Maryland home of Christopher Paul Hasson. The self-proclaimed white nationalist had drawn up a list of targets including prominent Democratic politicians, according to prosecutors. He is said to have drawn inspiration from the Norwegian mass murderer Anders Breivik. ""The defendant intends to murder innocent civilians on a scale rarely seen in this country,"" US District Attorney Robert Hur said in the court documents, requesting that he be held in detention pending trial. Mr Hasson appeared in court on Thursday Mr Hasson is charged with unlawful possession of a firearm and controlled substances, but prosecutors say these ""current charges, however, are the proverbial tip of the iceberg"". ""The defendant is a domestic terrorist, bent on committing acts dangerous to human life that are intended to affect governmental conduct."" The 49-year-old is a lieutenant at Coast Guard headquarters in Washington and lives in the Maryland suburb of Silver Spring. The Coast Guard confirmed that a member of the service had been arrested, and said he was no longer employed at the agency's headquarters. Fifteen guns and more than 1,000 rounds of ammunition were found in Mr Hasson's basement flat along with illegal drugs, the attorney's office said. Illegal drugs included human growth hormones and steroids, prosecutors say When agents raided his home, they discovered a locked case with more than 30 vials of human growth hormone, a steroid that prosecutors say he took thinking that it would ""increase his ability to conduct attacks"". Officials say he also had ordered more than 4,200 pills of the narcotic Tramadol since 2016, as well as synthetic urine in order to pass random drug tests at work. Prosecutors said that in a draft email from June 2017 Mr Hasson wrote: ""I am dreaming of a way to kill almost every last person on the earth. I think a plague would be most successful but how do I acquire the needed Spanish flu, botulism, anthrax, not sure yet but will find something."" A list of possible targets included Democratic House speaker Nancy Pelosi and Democratic Senate minority leader Chuck Schumer as well as media personalities including MSNBC's Chris Hayes and Joe Scarborough. Since 2017 Mr Hasson had studied parts of a manifesto by Anders Breivik on how to amass firearms and compile a list of targets, prosecutors allege. Breivik murdered 77 people in 2011 in two terror attacks. He killed eight people with a car bomb in central Oslo and then shot dead 69 others, many of them teenagers, at a Labour Party camp. Mr Hanson was inspired to create his list by Breivik, prosecutors say. ""During unrest target both sides to increase tension,"" Mr Hasson wrote in one draft email. ""In other words provoke gov/police to over react which should help to escalate violence. BLM [Black Lives Matter] protests or other left crap would be ideal to incite to violence."" In another email to a white supremacist almost two months after a rally in Charlottesville which led to the death of a counter-protester, he wrote of his hope for a ""white homeland"". ""I never saw a reason for mass protest or wearing uniforms marching around provoking people with swastikas etc.,"" Hasson said in the letter, according to court filings. ""I was and am a man of action you cannot change minds protesting like that. However you can make change with a little focused violence."" Coast guard removed for 'white power sign' His internet search records showed he searched for the home addresses of members of Congress, including Democratic Congresswoman Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. The New York City congresswoman on Wednesday criticised journalists for reporting on her new Washington DC apartment as Mr Hasson was allegedly plotting his attack against her and other lawmakers.

During court appearance on Thursday, Federal Magistrate Judge Charles Day ordered him to be held in detention for 14 days. After 14 days, the judge ruled, he can re-argue for his release unless more charges are filed against him. During the hearing, Mr Hasson's defence team argued that he should be released to his wife given his career of military service on behalf of the United States. According to CBS, his lawyers called his gun collection ""modest at best"" and said the charges were ""histrionic and ""without substance"". Allow Twitter content?

Nestle pulls YouTube ads over abuse claims,"Kit-Kat maker Nestle is one of several firms that have ""paused"" YouTube adverts The food giant Nestle and several other big companies have pulled their adverts from YouTube following claims they appeared next to offensive content. It comes after a vlogger accused YouTube of failing to stop a ""soft-core paedophilia ring"" on its platform. The vlogger said the firm made it easy to find videos of young girls, even though comments clearly showed that viewers were sexualising the videos. YouTube said it took ""immediate action"" to delete the offending accounts. The firm, which shares a parent company with Google, has been criticised for not removing offensive content fast enough in the past. YouTube abuse clip hunters promised breaks YouTube in Pokemon child abuse images row Vlogger Matt Watson made the allegations in a video posted on YouTube that has been watched nearly two million times. He explained the videos themselves were not sexual, but that commentators had flagged moments when girls appeared in compromising positions - such as performing gymnastics or posing in front of a mirror. One watch spurred YouTube's algorithm to recommend similar videos, some of which ran next to ads from firms such as Disney and Nestle. A Nestle spokeswoman said the food maker had decided to ""pause"" YouTube advertising globally while the issue was investigated. ""We will revise our decision upon completion of current measures being taken ... to ensure NestlÃ© advertising standards are met,"" she said. Epic Games, the maker of the Fortnite video game, also said it had halted ads on the platform. It said: ""Through our advertising agency, we have reached out to Google/YouTube to determine actions they'll take to eliminate this type of content from their service."" Disney and German food company Dr August Oetker also took action, according to Bloomberg, which first reported the story. In its statement YouTube said: ""Any content - including comments - that endangers minors is abhorrent and we have clear policies prohibiting this on YouTube,"" the company said. ""There's more to be done, and we continue to work to improve and catch abuse more quickly."" It is not the first time YouTube has run into this kind of problem. Part of its system for reporting sexualised comments left on children's videos wasnot functioning correctly for more than a year, moderators said back in 2017. In 2017,the company apologisedafter adverts from government agencies and companies such as Marks & Spencer and Audi appeared next to videos from supporters of extremist groups on YouTube's platform. At the time, those companies also pulled ads amid the controversy. Despite growing pressure on Google and YouTube to crack down on offensive content, the firms' advertising revenues continue to thrive. Their parent company, Alphabet, earned almost $137bn (Â£105bn) in revenue in 2018, up 23% from the prior year.

Bangladesh building fire kills dozensAt least 60 people die in the blaze in a residential building also used as a chemical warehouse.Asia,"This video can not be played Deadly fire sweeps Dhaka historic district A fast-moving fire swept through a historic district of Bangladesh's capital, Dhaka, killing at least 78 people, officials say. The blaze broke out at night in a residential building that had flammable material stored on the ground floor. Members of a bridal party are thought to be among the victims. It is not yet clear what started the fire. The centuries-old Chawkbazar district has narrow streets and buildings very close to each other. Large building fires are relatively common in densely populated Bangladesh, owing to lax safety regulations and poor conditions. Hundreds of people have been killed in recent years. On Sunday,a fire in a slum in the coastal city of Chittagongkilled at least nine people. The fire broke out in a mixed-use building at 23:40 local time (17:40 GMT) on Wednesday, when many residents were sleeping. It started at a chemical warehouse on the ground floor and then raced through three other buildings, officials say. Many people were trapped, unable to escape the flames. Witnesses and police said gas explosions helped fuel the blaze. Volunteers recovering a body from a burnt warehouse Mohammad Firoz, who sells cosmetics in Chawkbazar, said 25 of his friends and relatives were missing and that he feared his brother was dead. He said he had seen an electricity transformer explode, causing a minibus parked below to catch fire. Its gas cylinder then exploded, causing a blaze in a nearby chemical shop. ""The flames spread so quickly,"" he told the BBC's Bengali service. He said his brother, Hira, who worked in a nearby pharmacy, closed the shutters of the shop after one of the explosions, fearing there had been a bombing. ""I fear he died inside the shop, I am still searching for his dead body."" Haji Abdul Kader, whose shop was destroyed, said he had ""heard a big bang"". He told AFP news agency: ""I turned back and saw the whole street in flames. Flames were everywhere."" Chawkbazar: The 400-year-old bustling heart of Dhaka The death toll stood at 78, Dr Sohail Mahmoud, head of the department of forensic medicine at Dhaka Medical College, told reporters. ""Up to now, we have 67 bodies in our mortuary and the hospital morgue has 11 dead bodies,"" he said. Victims included people outside the buildings, some guests at a restaurant and members of a bridal party, AFP reports. Most of the bodies were charred beyond recognition. Some of the injured were in critical condition. The number of victims is expected to rise as the search continues through the damaged buildings. Distraught relatives have been gathering at Dhaka Medical College hospital Firefighters fought for more than five hours to put out the blaze, hindered by narrow streets and a lack of water sources. Prime Minister Sheikh Hasina expressed her shock over the tragedy and conveyed condolences to those affected, the Dhaka Tribune reports. By Rakib Hasnet, BBC Bengali Chawkbazar is one of the most important areas in Old Dhaka, a historic district established about 400 years ago during the Mughal dynasty. It is a hub of chemical businesses and local perfume factories, though authorities banned the storage of chemical goods after a deadly fire in 2010. The streets are packed with rickshaws, small cars and people walking around during the day. The lanes are so narrow that passenger buses cannot get through. Electrical, telephone and internet cables hanging above the narrow lanes pose a real danger. But the most serious threat comes from the fact that residential buildings are used for commercial purposes, with ground floors serving as chemical and gas cylinder warehouses. In June 2010, a blaze in the Nimtali district killed 124 people, a fire that was also made worse by the presence of an illegal chemicals warehouse. After that incident, a committee suggested the removal of all chemicals warehouses from residential areas, but critics say no significant steps have been taken in the years since. Bangladesh slum fire kills nine Just one week ago, authorities announced a campaign to identify illegal chemical business in old Dhaka. Similar campaigns have been conducted in the past but none of them were particularly successful. The scene of the fire in the crowded old quarter of Dhaka The lack of safety regulations was highlighted in 2013 when more than 1,100 people died and thousands more were injured when a building housing garment factories in Dhaka collapsed. Dhaka has a population of more than 18m people with some 3.5m living in slums, according to the World Bank. It is one of the world's most densely populated cities.

Gay partner of Serbian PM gives birth,"Ana Brnabic has been criticised by LGBT activists for not doing enough to defend gay rights in the country. Serbian Prime Minister Ana Brnabic's gay partner has given birth in what the PM's office said was a first for a world leader. A statement said the birth mother, Milica Djurdjic, and baby, reportedly a boy named Igor, were ""doing fine"". Ms Brnabic, 43, became both Serbia's first female and first gay prime minister in June 2017. Her appointmentwas seen as a surprise move for the Balkan nation where same-sex marriage is not recognised. ""Ana Brnabic is one of the first prime ministers whose partner has given birth while in office... and the first in the world in a same-sex couple,"" the AFP agency quoted her office as saying. Profile: Ana Brnabic Serbia's gay PM at Pride march Ms Djurdjic, who works as a doctor, became pregnant though artificial insemination. She and Ms Brnabic met at a gay bar in the capital, Belgrade. Serbia is socially conservative and homophobia is common. The country's constitution explicitly defines marriage as being between a man and a woman, and gay civil partnerships are not officially recognised. Same-sex couples are also barred from adopting children, though single people can adopt regardless of their sexual orientation. Serbia has several laws in place to tackle discrimination, inequality and hate speech, but activists argue that not enough is being done to expand these rights or enforce them. Critics have spoken out against Ms Brnabic, arguing that she has not done enough to bolster LGBT rights. At a Gay Pride parade in Belgrade in 2017, she refused to say if she would like to see same-sex marriage legalised in Serbia.

Corbyn calls on Labour defectors to quit,"Heidi Allen (centre) is hopeful more MPs will join the breakaway Labour and the Conservatives could face more resignations, with members of the new Independent Group saying they expect more MPs to join them. Ex-Tory MP Heidi Allen told ITV's Peston programme ""a third"" of Tory MPs were fed up with the party's direction. Tory MP Justine Greening said she would quit in the event of a no-deal Brexit, saying she couldn't stay in a party that became ""simply a Brexit party"". MPs from the new group say they stand for ""the centre ground of politics"". The group was set up by eight defecting Labour MPs unhappy about their party's handling of Brexit and anti-Semitism. Who are the Independent Group and what do they want? What does it feel like to quit a party? Who are the MPs resigning? They were later joined by three pro-Remain Tories - Anna Soubry, Heidi Allen and Sarah Wollaston - who accuse the Conservative leadership of allowing right-wing hardliners to shape the party's approach to Brexit and other matters. Chancellor Philip Hammond told BBC Radio 4's Today programme he was ""saddened"" by his former colleagues' comments, but hoped ""over time they will feel able to rejoin the party"". He denied their claims that the pro-Brexit European Research Group, headed by Jacob Rees-Mogg, was now running the party, dismissing them as a ""relatively small hardcore"", and insisting the Conservative Party was still a ""broad church"". Conservative MP and vice chairman of the European Research Group Mark Francois denied his group was a ""party within a party"" that had taken control, saying they were ""a group of Conservative MPs who are passionately committed to honouring the democratic decision of the British people that we should leave the EU"". He added: ""Conversely, Anna, Heidi and Sarah are now a party without a party, who are committed to precisely the opposite. As a result, we shall see how they get on."" Independent Group MP Sarah Wollaston has claimed a third of the cabinet would quit if there was a no-deal Brexit. Mr Hammond refused to rule out his own departure - but he said the threat of a no-deal Brexit had ""focused minds"" and was encouraging compromise. Justine Greening - a former education secretary - told the Today programme she tempted to break away from the party. ""It is something that I have considered, but I have reached a different conclusion for the moment,"" Ms Greening told Today. ""I don't think I would be able to stay part of a party that was simply a Brexit party that had crashed us out of the European Union."" This video can not be played ""I don't think I would be able to stay part of a party that was simply a Brexit party that had crashed us out of the EU"" Former Attorney General Dominic Grieve told BBC's Newsnight said he admired the courage of the breakaway group - and he would not be able to stay in the Conservative Party if it ""went completely off the rails"" and backed leaving the EU without a negotiated agreement. Labour's Ian Austin also expressed sympathy with the Independent Group's aims, saying he would think ""long and hard"" about his future in the Labour party. Shadow home Secretary Diane Abbott told BBC Radio 4's The World at One: ""I am very sad that the Labour members of this new independent organisation have gone. ""Up until the last minute, people were talking to them, trying to persuade them not to take the step they have taken."" She said she hoped they would continue to work with Labour on issues like homelessness, the benefit system, the NHS and ""most of all fighting this Tory Brexit"". Senior Conservatives have suggested the door is open for the three Tories who quit to return one day. But Ms Soubry insisted there was no ""going back"" because the soul of the party had been overwhelmed by a rightwing ""purple Momentum"" a reference to former UKIP members they claim are joining local Tory parties to de-select Remain-supporting MPs. She also revealed that former PM David Cameron had made a last-ditch attempt to stop the trio from quitting. Speaking to The Times Red Box podcast, she said Mr Cameron had sent them a text saying: ""Is it too late to persuade you to stay?"" This video can not be played What the three ex-Conservatives said about their departures What does it feel like to quit a party? Three Tory MPs join breakaway group Who are the MPs resigning? Ms Allen also said she could not imagine returning ""because if we do our jobs right there won't be a Tory party to go back to"". She said she was ""hopeful"" that what she described as ""good, sensible centre ground colleagues"" would join the new group. Meanwhile, in avideo released on Twitter,externalon Wednesday night, Labour leader Mr Corbyn said defecting Labour MPs should resign and put themselves up for election. He said this would be the ""democratic thing to do"" because they wanted to ""abandon the policies on which they were elected"". Momentum, the Labour movement backing Mr Corbyn, is to hold ""mass canvassing events"" in several constituencies with Independent Group MPs to build support in the event of any by-elections.

What does it feel like to quit a party?,"What will the MPs who have quit their parties to form a new centrist group in Parliament be feeling right now? Scared? Relieved? Excited? Or filled with sadness and even a touch of regret? It was easy to see all of those emotions on display at the press conferences - two days apart - in which seven Labour MPs and then three Conservatives announced that they were quitting (the 11th member of the group, Joan Ryan, did not hold a press conference of her own). But the tone of the two events was different. The Labour defectors all spoke about what the Labour Party meant to them, how they had joined it as young people, filled with idealism and a desire to improve the lives of working people. But, they said, the party had changed beyond all recognition under Jeremy Corbyn and they could no longer be part of it. In other words: ""It's not me, it's you."" Three Tory MPs join breakaway group Eighth MP quits Labour for Independent Group Minor tremor or political earthquake? Mike Gapes: Labour to my core Mike Gapes - Labour MP for Ilford South since 1992 and a party member since 1968 - was, perhaps understandably, the most visibly moved by the occasion. ""I have always considered myself Labour to my core. I grew up in a working-class family, in a council house in Chigwell, in Essex,"" he told the audience. He spoke about his father, ""a postman and trade union branch secretary"", and how he had served the party ""at every level"" in his long career. Angela Smith spoke at length about her working-class parents and how as a young girl she had cheered for then Labour leader Harold Wilson in 1966, when the rest of the country had been cheering England on in the World Cup. Others were less sentimental about Labour. Chuka Umunna said he was fed up with the ""old tribal politics"", adding: ""You don't join a political party to spend years and years fighting the people in it."" Heidi Allen: I feel excited There were mixed emotions at the Conservative event too, with Anna Soubry clearly finding it difficult at times, but there was a lot of laughter too, and less talk about family and background. Heidi Allen, who opened the event, was upbeat and business-like, as if she was leaving a job rather than breaking up a family. ""I feel excited, so excited. In a way that I haven't felt since I was first elected - and a sense of liberation,"" said the former Tory MP, who described the breakaway group as the ""three Amigos"". Ms Allen does not have deep roots in the Conservative Party - she joined it in 2011 - after a successful career in business. The Conservative Party - rather than a creed or a way of life - had been a career choice for her, she said. And she had been inspired to ""serve my country"" by the 2011 London riots, having previously had no interest in politics. Like fellow defector, Sarah Wollaston Ms Allen was a product of David Cameron's efforts to open up the Conservative Party to a more diverse and interesting range of MPs, with real-life experience. Dr Wollaston, a GP, was the first Conservative MP to be selected in a US-style open primary, a postal ballot of everyone in her Totnes constituency, in 2009. Anna Soubry: A considerable amount of heartache Ms Allen also took part in an open primary, in South East Cambridgeshire, which she narrowly lost, before being selected to replace the retiring Andrew Lansley in South Cambridgeshire. Both have proved to be far too independent-minded for the Conservative Party whips, perhaps feeling they owe their first loyalty to their constituents rather than the party. And Dr Wollaston said she would not put herself forward as a Tory candidate now - because the party had changed so much. The open primary system, meanwhile, appears to have been dropped. And it was clear from Anna Soubry's speech that all three believe Mr Cameron's attempt to modernise the Conservative Party is equally dead in the water. Mr Cameron - in a rare public comment - said he had backed open primaries and he respected the decision of Dr Wollaston and Ms Allen to quit the party but he disagreed with them. ""We need strong voices at every level of the party calling for the modern, compassionate Conservatism that saw the Conservative Party return to office,"" said the former Tory leader. Anna Soubry told the Times Red Box podcast Mr Cameron made a last-ditch bid to try to stop the three from quitting, sending them a text saying: ""Is it too late to persuade you to stay?"" Ms Soubry - who first joined the Conservatives as a student in the 1970s - was more sentimental about the party, in her speech. ""You don't leave a political party you have called home, without a great deal of thought and a considerable amount of heartache,"" she said. But, she added, she had always been a member of the pro-EU ""one-nation"" Tory faction and now the party was entirely run by the ""awkward squad"" of hard Brexiteers in the European Research Group. What does Theresa May make of it all? The ERG, which is headed by Jacob Rees-Mogg, is arguably far more in tune with the Conservative Party membership - who, polls suggest, are a Eurosceptic bunch (although the defectors say this is because local branches are being ""infiltrated"" by former UKIP members). What Theresa May makes of all this is anybody's guess. As Tom McTaguepointed out in a piece for Politico,external, even her closest associates have trouble working out what she thinks. But she is someone who puts a high value on party loyalty. To a far greater extent, perhaps, than the MPs who have now walked out of it, the Conservative Party has been her life. She met her husband, Philip, at a Tory party dance, at Oxford University, and she is thought to do most of her socialising with fellow party members. Leaving a political party because you profoundly disagree with the direction it is taking might seem an obvious thing to do for those of us who have never been a member of one, let alone an MP. But it is not as straightforward as that for some. And factors such as family tradition, loyalty to friends, and the sheer amount of time and work devoted to the cause - even if you no longer believe in it -  will be playing on the minds of MPs thinking of joining the breakaway group in the coming days.

Warning over asylum-seeker council costs,"Councils say they are struggling to cope with the cost of young migrants who reach the UK The cost to councils in England of looking after rising numbers of child asylum seekers has almost doubled in four years, the Local Government Association (LGA) says. It says the annual cost of providing accommodation and care for these young asylum seekers has now risen to Â£152m. And councils, already under financial pressure, need more support from central government, the LGA says. The Home Office says funding arrangements are ""under review"". Local authorities are legally required to care for child asylum seekers without relatives. But, the LGA says, they will already face a Â£3.1bn funding gap for children's services by 2025 and cannot be expected to absorb the extra costs of accommodation and support for young asylum seekers. In 2014-15, they were spending about Â£78m on caring for about 2,800 young asylum seekers. But in 2017-18, they were looking after almost 4,500 young asylum seekers, with costs increasing by 95%, to Â£152m. Local authorities are obliged to look after young asylum seekers coming to the UK Local authorities receive some support from central government but they say it is not enough to cover the full costs. As well as accommodation, councils say they have expenses such as social workers and mental health services. ""Councils have a strong track record supporting those resettling in the UK and are committed to providing the best support possible,"" said David Simmonds, who chairs the LGA's asylum, migration and refugee task group. But, he said, given the ""significant financial pressures"" facing councils, it was becoming ""more and more challenging"" to provide the services they were legally obliged to. Mr Simmonds called on the government to announce the findings of a review into funding support for unaccompanied children. He said it was vital that there was a ""joint commitment"" between national and local government about adequate levels of funding. A Home Office spokesman said the government recognised the efforts of councils in providing ""care for a significant number of unaccompanied asylum-seeking children"". ""We are currently reviewing the funding arrangements and over 50 local authorities have taken part,"" he said. ""We hope to reach a conclusion soon but it is right that we take time to thoroughly assess the evidence.""

"May sees progress in EU backstop talksThe PM says ""time is of the essence"" as she stresses the need for legally-binding Brexit changes in Brussels.UK Politics","Theresa May arriving in Brussels to meet European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker Theresa May has said progress has been made in talks about changes to the Brexit deal that could win MPs' backing but admitted ""time is of the essence"". The PM met the EU's Jean-Claude Juncker in Brussels to discuss legally-binding guarantees over the Irish border. Earlier, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said ""small but important"" changes to the backstop would allay MPs' concerns it could be trapped in a customs union. But Home Secretary Sajid Javid said the chances of a no-deal exit had risen. Speaking on ITV's Peston show, Mr Javid said it was ""fair to say that in the past few weeks the probability of a no-deal Brexit has gone up"". The prime minister is trying to renegotiate the backstop - the insurance policy to prevent the return of physical checks on the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. It is the most contentious part of the withdrawal agreement Mrs May agreed with the EU in November, which was rejected by Parliament by a large margin last month. Adler: UK expectations meet EU reality on Brexit Tories 'manipulated by Brexit zealots' Brexit: A really simple guide Critics fear the backstop - which could be activated if the two sides do not settle their future partnership by the end of 2020 and choose not to extend the transition period - would leave the UK tied to a customs union indefinitely and see Northern Ireland treated differently. The EU has consistently said it will not reopen discussions over the withdrawal agreement agreed in November. Mrs May said the two sides had made progress and that she had made it clear MPs would only accept guarantees that had similar legal force to the agreement. ""We have agreed that work to find a solution will continue at pace, time is of the essence and it is in both our interests that when the UK leaves the EU it does so in an orderly way,"" she said.

The EU said the discussions, which are also focusing on the use of technology, were constructive but the timing was ""tight"". On a visit to Germany earlier, Mr Hunt warned the greatest threat to Brexit was ""defeatism"" over getting a deal through Parliament. Speaking after talks with his German counterpart in Berlin, Mr Hunt said it would be a ""disaster"" for both sides if the UK left the EU without a negotiated agreement on 29 March. But he said the risk of ""paralysis"" in the process was equally damaging to business. Amid speculation that Mrs May could put the deal to Parliament again as soon as next week, Mr Hunt said the role of Attorney General Geoffrey Cox would be vital in the unfolding process. Mr Cox, who will also be in Brussels for talks later this week, told MPs in December that although the agreement stipulated the backstop would be temporary and only apply until the two sides settled their future relationship, there was no way for the UK to leave it without the approval of EU member states. MPs gave their backing for Mrs May to renegotiate the policy in a vote earlier this month although many remain unconvinced that the EU can be forced to change its position. But Mr Hunt said the government was confident, on the basis of discussions with Conservatives and some Labour MPs, that if the issue was resolved then the deal would pass. ""The critical thing is that Geoffrey Cox needs to be able to change his advice to Parliament,"" he said. ""The current text uses the word temporary to describe the backstop, so what we need to do is put some flesh on the bone of what temporary actually means,"" he said. ""I think... with political will and conviction we can find a way to solve that problem."" How Brexit hit the pound in your pocket Brexit: Will Britons in the EU still get healthcare?

Derek Hatton suspended by Labour,"Derek Hatton has been suspended by the Labour Party less than 48 hours after he was admitted back into the party. The ex-deputy leader of Liverpool council's membership was provisionally approved on Monday, more than 30 years after he was expelled from the party. But senior Labour figures have since complained about the move and comments the ex-Militant man made about Israel. In a tweet in 2012, he urged ""Jewish people with any sense of humanity"" to condemn Israel's ""ruthless murdering"". A Labour party source said the party was ""not aware of this material"" when it had provisionally approved Mr Hatton's application to rejoin the party. And ""once this was brought to our attention"", Mr Hatton's membership application had been suspended pending a final decision by the party's ruling body, the National Executive Committee. Mr Hatton was a key figure in Militant, a Trotskyite far-left group that ran Liverpool council in the early 1980s. Derek Hatton rejoins Labour after 34 years Who is Derek Hatton? He was expelled in 1985 after a high-profile battle with Labour's then leader, Neil Kinnock, who accused him and others of seeking to infiltrate and subvert the party. It emerged on Monday that his application to rejoin the Liverpool Wavertree branch of the Labour Party had been provisionally approved by a special panel of the party. But this drew fierce criticism from many leading figures in the party, coming on the same day as seven MPs quit the party in protest at what they said was a culture of anti-Semitism in the party. Earlier on Wednesday, shadow cabinet member Barry Gardiner told MPs he had lodged a formal complaint about the 2012 tweet and believed action was being taken. ""It was a travesty for the news of his readmission to come to public attention on the day when some members of our party were forced out was appalling,"" he added. The party's deputy leader Tom Watson has also written to Labour's general secretary, Jennie Formby, questioning the decision to provisionally readmit Mr Hatton. Mr Hatton posted the 2012 message during ""Operation Pillar of Defence"" a week-long offensive by the Israel Defence Forces in Gaza. According to a UNHCR report, 174 Palestinians were killed during the operation, and hundreds were injured. At the time, NATO Secretary General Anders Fogh Rasmussen said ""of course Israel has the right to self-defence and attacks against Israel must end, but the international community would also expect Israel to show restraint"".
