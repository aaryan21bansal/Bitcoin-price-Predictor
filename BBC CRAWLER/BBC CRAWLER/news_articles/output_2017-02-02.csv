Lettuce 'rationing' and back pain cures,"There is universal condemnation in Friday's papers for the lawyer struck off after he was found to have acted dishonestly in bringing murder and torture claims against British Iraq War veterans. The Daily Telegraph thinks Phil Shiner should now be investigated by the criminal authorities ""with the same vigour they showed in investigating those he falsely accused"". It says he was ""on a crusade;,externala mission, it seemed, to tear apart the reputation of the British armed forces"". The Times says he has been made a""pariah of his profession"",external, and calls for proper safeguards for soldiers so they cannot in future be subjected to allegations based on ""cooked-up evidence"". The Daily Mail agrees, saying the ""witch-hunt"" extends as far as Northern Ireland, where police are investigating more than 300 killings by the Army during the Troubles. The paper says Mr Shiner""is a stain on the legal establishment"",external. The Guardian has discovered that there is aban on non-urgent surgery in West Kent,externaluntil the new financial year begins, in April. It says around 1,700 people will be affected by the decision, which has been prompted by a cash crisis. The Royal College of Surgeons tells the paper the policy will prolong patients' suffering and may even cost more in the long term as conditions worsen. The group which commissions treatment in the area says no patients will have operations cancelled as a result of the measures. Rationing of a different kind is on thefront page of the Daily Mail,external. It says some supermarkets have begun imposing limits on the number of vegetables customers can buy due to the shortages caused by bad weather in the Mediterranean. Iceberg lettuces are being rationed in Tesco and Morrisons, which is also capping the purchase of broccoli. For the Guardian, it is""just the tip of the iceberg"",external. It says: ""British shoppers have already been warned that shortages of courgettes, aubergines, salad and celery will continue until the spring - and they can expect to pay substantially higher prices for the stock that is available."" The Mirror leads withan investigation into the poaching of gorillas,externalin the Democratic Republic of Congo, where populations have fallen by 80% in 20 years. The paper says the animals are being shot for bush meat by militia groups and miners looking for a rare metal used in the manufacture of mobile phones and games consoles. It is calling on the international community to act now to stop the slaughter. The Times, meanwhile, is urging the government to bring abouta housing revolution,externalby allowing more development of the Green Belt. It reports that a white paper on housing - due out next week - is expected to relax building height restrictions, among other measures. However, the paper thinks the Tories should go further - and have the stomach for a fight in its heartlands, where the Green Belt is seen as sacrosanct. Staying in the countryside, a new study about the benefits of camping is widely reported. Apparently a night under canvas can help with insomnia by resetting the body's circadian rhythm, or internal clock, because campers are forced to adapt their sleeping patterns to the natural light. However,the Telegraph warns,externalthere is a price to be paid for new-found health: it only works if there's strictly no peeking at the mobile phone. And finally. Several newspapers reveal the possible secret of Donald Trump's remarkable hair. According to the Times, it's an issue which has fascinated Americans throughout his career. Meanwhile, the new US president's head of hair is described in the Daily Express as a ""gravity-defying bouffant"". Its mystery, though, may have been solved by his long-time doctor. Dr Harold Bornstein told theNew York Times,externalthat the president takes a prostate-related drug that stimulates hair growth. He confirmed the president's hair was all real, but said it was helped to grow by a small dose of the drug finasteride, which lowers levels of prostate-specific antigen. The doctor said: ""He has all his hair. I have all my hair.""

Former England midfielder Lampard retires,"Frank Lampard make 649 appearances for Chelsea in 13 years with the club Former Chelsea and England midfielder Frank Lampard has retired, bringing to an end a 21-year professional career. The 38-year-old, who spent last year with New York City in Major League Soccer in the US, announced his decision on social media on Thursday. Lampard made 649 appearances for Chelsea and won 106 England caps. ""Whilst I have received a number of exciting offers to continue playing, at 38 I feel now is the time to begin the next chapter in my life,"" said Lampard. ""I'm grateful to the Football Association for the opportunity to study for my coaching qualifications and I look forward to pursuing the off-field opportunities that this decision opens."" He won 11 major trophies, including three Premier League titles and the Champions League in 2012. Lampard also won four FA Cups, two League Cups and the Europa League. Lampard v Gerrard - who was better? Read the stats and cast your vote Football Daily podcast: 'Every manager idolised Lampard' Listen: Lampard will go to the very top of management - Redknapp Only Ryan Giggs (632) and Gareth Barry (615) have made more Premier League appearances than Lampard (609). His total of 177 goals is the Premier League's fourth highest behind Alan Shearer, Wayne Rooney and Andy Cole. He has scored more goals from outside the box than any other Premier League player (41). Lampard scored against a record 39 different teams in the Premier League. No England player has scored as many penalties as Lampard (nine), excluding shootouts. BBC Sport chief football writer Phil McNulty Frank Lampard's legendary status and standing as one of the greatest players of the modern era is cemented by statistics. When he left Chelsea in the summer of 2014, he was the club's record goalscorer with 211 goals from 649 appearances - a truly remarkable return for a consummate professional plying his trade in midfield. Lampard was central to the most successful spell in Chelsea's history as he and they completed a clean sweep of trophies at home and abroad, a haul that reflected his stellar contribution. He was the model of consistency, respected and admired by team-mates and opponents alike. Like his great contemporary Steven Gerrard he struggled to transfer club successes to his England career, but he was still a fine performer on the international stage. Lampard's next step looks certain to be into coaching - and with the knowledge gained over a lifetime from his father Frank Sr as well as working with managers such as Jose Mourinho, Carlo Ancelotti and Guus Hiddink, few would bet against him adding to his successes in this phase of his career. Lampard won the Premier League three times with Chelsea Lampard joined Chelsea from boyhood club West Ham for a fee of Â£11m in 2001. His club-record 211 goals helped the Blues win the Champions League, three Premier Leagues, four FA Cups, two League Cups, the Europa League and a Community Shield. He played a pivotal role as Jose Mourinho's side delivered Chelsea's first top-flight championship in half a century, scoring 13 goals including both in the title-winning 2-0 victory at Bolton in April 2005. He added 16 league goals the following season as Chelsea retained their title, finishing runner-up to Barcelona forward Ronaldinho in both the Ballon d'Or and Fifa World Player of the Year awards. Lampard scored 10 or more Premier League goals in 10 successive seasons for Chelsea, reaching 22 as he collected a third Premier League winner's medal in 2009-10. Champions League success finally followed in 2011-12 as Lampard captained the side to a penalty shootout win over Bayern Munich in the absence of the suspended John Terry. ""He was definitely a world-class player for a long period of time,"" said BBC football analyst and former Chelsea winger Pat Nevin. ""I don't think we rate him as highly as we should do. ""He is kind of remembered just for scoring goals. That he was phenomenal at. There are very few people on the planet who can score that number of goals from midfield. ""He was a better all-round footballer than he was given credit for. When he was moved further back at the end of his career for Chelsea, he realised that his passing, short and long, was exceptional."" This video can not be played Archive: Lampard's 'goal' against Germany Lampard played a key role in bringing success back to Stamford Bridge, but he was unable to help replicate that trophy-laden touch with the national side. He made his England debut against Belgium in 1999, going on to win the same amount of caps as Sir Bobby Charlton, but missed out on a place in both the Euro 2000 and World Cup 2002 squads. Lampard scored three times as England reached the Euro 2004 quarter-finals, and finding a way to fit him and Steven Gerrard into the same midfield was seen as the solution to the national side's problems. The pair formed the core of what was tagged England's 'golden generation', but both missed a penalty in a World Cup quarter-final shootout defeat by Portugal in 2006 and England failed to qualify for the Euros two years later. A last-16 exit followed against Germany in the 2010 World Cup and Lampard missed Euro 2012 through injury, before playing his final major tournament for England in Brazil in 2014, when England went out in the group stage. ""From an England point of view he was pretty spectacular,"" added Nevin. ""There were times when he got a lot of stick. He still got all those caps and still scored a whole bunch of goals."" Lampard signed for West Ham as a schoolboy in 1994 Lampard began his career at West Ham, making his debut in January 1996 having progressed through the club's youth system. But the presence at the club of his dad Frank Lampard Sr, and uncle Harry Redknapp as manager, meant the teenager was singled out for criticism. Lampard even claimed in his autobiography that some Hammers fans cheered when he broke his leg during a game against Aston Villa. Later he would face a frosty reception when he controversially arrived at Manchester City after agreeing to join New York City - the MLS franchise set up by the Premier League club and the New York Yankees baseball team - in 2014. Lampard refused to celebratewhen he scored against Chelsea, and while his performances in Manchester saw his deal at Etihad Stadium extended, it prompted an angry reaction in New York. Lampard finally made his MLS debut in August 2015, but critics were underwhelmed by his performances and, after returning from an injury this season,he was jeered by his own fansand describedas ""the worst signing in MLS history"".,external But he rediscovered his scoring touch andthe city celebrated Frank Lampard Dayin September after he scored his 300th career goal. He went on to reach double figures in the MLS before announcinghis time at New York had come to an end. ""It was an incredible career when you consider he was written off right at the start and told he might not go that far,"" said former Scotland international Nevin. Lampard scored 12 times in the MLS during his second season for New York City This video can not be played Frank Lampard 'loving life' in US Nevin, a key member of the Chelsea side that won promotion from English football's second tier in 1984, says Lampard is capable of doing anything he wants to in the game. ""He's a hugely intelligent guy,"" said Nevin. ""He could actually go into an area where he could be running part of a club. If he wants to go down that route he is perfectly capable. ""Looking at his capabilities, anything within the game is possible for him, be it coaching, be it managing, be it working with the FA. ""I hope the game doesn't lose him, but I don't think it will. I think he loves the game too much."" Match of the Day presenter and former England international Gary Lineker recentlywent to New York to speak to Lampard about his future. ""Lampard says he is very keen on getting into coaching, which is not a path too many English players of his calibre have taken recently when their playing days ended,"" said Lineker. ""Part of that is down to them having other options. Punditry is one of them and I am sure he would be very good at it - there would be plenty of people trying to get him to work for them. ""But it would be nice to see someone like Lampard go into the coaching game, with his intelligence and passion and especially because he wants to test himself as a manager."" Former Chelsea midfielder and assistant manager Ray Wilkins told BBC Radio 5 live:""Frank's been exceptional and ranks among best that have ever played for Chelsea with his goals, his creativity, his work ethic. He's everything anyone wants as a coach or manager. ""I would love him to go [and manage] a Premier League side and not anywhere else. He knows what the Premier League is all about. Go in where you know - he knows top-quality international footballers. Give him the opportunity to do his stuff."" Lampard or Gerrard - who did you choose?

Huddersfield 3-1 Brighton,"Nahki Wells has scored 42 of his 100 career goals for Huddersfield Huddersfield showed their promotion credentials with an impressive home win over Brighton, who missed the chance to extend their Championship lead. The Seagulls remain one point ahead of second-placed Newcastle. Tommy Smith's angled shot put the hosts in front before Tomer Hemed rounded the goalkeeper to equalise. Nahki Wells fired into the top corner and Elias Kachunga nodded in to make it 3-1 before half-time, and Lewis Dunk's red card added to Brighton's misery. Centre-back Dunk was sent off for a second yellow card midway through the second half for a lunging challenge on Izzy Brown, having been booked in the first period for a foul on the same player. Relive Huddersfield's win over Brighton The Terriers' seventh win in nine league matches keeps them fifth, but they are now just two points behind fourth-placed Leeds, who they play at home on Sunday. Brighton,knocked out of the FA Cup by non-league Lincolnfive days earlier, were uncharacteristically poor in defence and conceded three goals in a league match for the first time in almost 12 months. The outstanding Rajiv van La Parra had already hit the post before full-back Smith's attempted cross landed back at his feet, and his subsequent shot flew in at the near post. Hemed pounced on a poor back header from Huddersfield's Aaron Mooy to level, but that proved to be the only clear chance they created in the entire 90 minutes. Wells' excellent finish from just inside the box was his 100th goal in English football, and it was the former Bradford forward's shot which goalkeeper David Stockdale palmed into the air for Kachunga to head in Huddersfield's third from close range. After Dunk's dismissal, the fifth of his career, there was still time for Australian midfielder Mooy to strike the upright from long range and Stockdale to tip over a powerful attempt from substitute Kasey Palmer. Huddersfield head coach David Wagner told BBC Radio Leeds: ""It was a good one, maybe one of the best this season. We scored three goals and had chances for more, and conceded a sloppy goal which was easy to avoid, but it was very good. ""We are fresh and still very hungry and greedy, even when we are humble and we know we're playing against the best team in the division. ""We gave ourselves no limits, we try our best and today our best was very good."" Brighton manager Chris Hughton told BBC Sussex: ""Every now and again you get a real bad one, and that was a real bad one. ""We were nowhere near the levels you need to play any game in this division, never mind one as good as Huddersfield, and on their own ground too. ""If we put in another performance like this at Brentford on Sunday, we will lose again. We need to be far better. ""Lewis Dunk has played the ball but he was already on a yellow and he's given the referee a decision to make. It's another one for him and something he has to learn from. We are going to miss him. It's a blow.""

Weekend camping resets body clock,"The researchers dragged volunteers on to a camping trip in the midst of a Colorado winter Spending a weekend out camping resets the clock inside our bodies that influences sleeping habits, scientists at a US university have discovered. The team argue that time in the great outdoors could help those struggling to get up in the morning and boost health. The researchers said swapping bricks and mortar for canvas was not a long-term solution. But exposing ourselves to more bright light in the day (and less at night) could help. Our body has a daily ""circadian"" rhythm that anticipates day and night to co-ordinate how our body works. It alters alertness, mood, physical strength, when we need to sleep and even the risk of a heart attack as part of a 24-hour cycle. Body Clock: What is happening in your body right now? 'Arrogance' of ignoring need for sleep Light helps the clock keep time, but modern life with artificial light, alarm clocks and smartphones has altered our sleeping habits. The reportis published in Current Biology,externaland Dr Kenneth Wright, from the University of Colorado Boulder, told the BBC: ""We're waking up at a time when our circadian clock says we should still be asleep."" He says this is damaging to health with studies suggesting links with mood disorders, type 2 diabetes and obesity. And it also simply makes us really groggy and sleepy when we try to get up in the morning. So Dr Wright organised a series of camping expeditions for a small group of volunteers. They had to wear special watches that recorded light levels and had blood tests to analyse the sleep hormone melatonin. And the only artificial light they were allowed was the glow of a campfire, even a torch was banned. The first thing they learned on a week-long camping trip in winter was people were exposed to 13 times more light than at home, even though it was the darkest part of the year. Their melatonin levels also started to rise two-and-a-half hours earlier than before the expedition and they went to bed earlier too. The campers were now sleeping and waking in tune with their body clocks. Another camping trip showed most of that benefit could be gained by just going away for a weekend. Dr Wright said: ""We're not saying camping is the answer here, but we can introduce more natural light to modern life. ""It is something we as a society can regulate without people having to change behaviours."" He thinks homes, offices and schools could be designed to allow in more natural light. And the new generation of ""tuneable"" light bulbs - that can be made far brighter in the day and dimmer at night - could also be used. However, at the moment, people's body clocks would start to shift back to their old rhythm once the tent was packed up. In order to continue to benefit from the camping reset, people would need to get a large hit of light in the day - for example by going out for a walk before work - and cut down in the evening by using less artificial light. And if you want to watch your favourite TV show ""record it"", says Dr Wright. The researchers also picked up clues that our body clocks alter during the year and that may affect how our body functions. In a week of summer camping, melatonin production was altered by two hours, in winter it was altered by 2.6 hours. It is a suggestion there is something different about the way our bodies react to the longer or shorter day. And we already know that some people suffer from low mood with seasonal affective disorders. Dr Wright added: ""We have a hint there's something there and maybe at one point it time it was critical and now, in a modern environment, maybe we don't need to worry about putting on more weight in winter, but the impacts may still be hardwired in our physiology.""

Your buried treasures,"John buried a Matchbox car and a halfpenny in his time capsule Many people around the world make time capsules with items included in them, hoping someone will find them many years later. A Blue Peter Millennium time capsulehas been accidentally dug up 33 years earlier than planned.It was buried under the Millennium Dome, now the O2 Arena, in 1998 and was not supposed to be unearthed until 2050. We asked people to share their stories and to tell us what they included in their time capsules. Here are some of the responses we received. John Carver, 59, buried his time capsule 51 years ago. It included many items including crayons as he thought there would not be colours in the future. He never found the capsule. ""I buried a time capsule when I was about eight. The contents included, as far as I can remember, crayons, a halfpenny and a Matchbox car. ""They were 'securely' packaged in a Marmite jar which then came with a metal lid. It was buried in the lawn of the family home, which has recently been sold, never to be seen again. ""Within a very short time the hole I had dug disappeared and I could never accurately pinpoint where it was. ""It was the family home for 56 years and over the years, I have always thought about it."" Mike Simpson and his son Thomas created a time capsule hoping that a boy from the future would find it one day and read it. The capsule included a list of Thomas's favourite things, ranging from his favourite meal to his favourite TV show, which is Doctor Who. ""Thomas was just starting to get interested in history so this was a project that helped him to understand the passage of time and consider how a house can be home to many different families over a century,"" Mike says. ""Eight years ago when Thomas was five we moved into our present home, which dates from the 1890s. Removing old plaster to add a damp course revealed some gaps between the Victorian bricks where mortar had crumbled. ""We created a letter to a little boy from the future, listing Thomas's name, school, favourite food, favourite TV show among other things. Thomas pictured with his favourite items, some of which he buried in the time capsule ""We carefully folded this up and sealed it in a plastic bag with one of his school photos and a penny dated that year. This was pushed between two bricks and then plastered over. ""Hopefully decades from now someone will find a message from the past."" Aged about 10, Angus Macdonald, now 50, buried his time capsule in his parents' back garden in Singapore in 1976. ""It was a big glass jam jar, buried only about a foot down, and it contained the front page of that day's newspaper and a few other personal bits and pieces.

Trans parenting,"A booklet published by the British Medical Association suggests that its staff should use the phrase ""pregnant people"" instead of ""expectant mothers"" in order to show sensitivity towards intersex men and trans men who get pregnant. The BBC's Siobhann Tighe spoke to one trans man for his view on the BMA's guidance. It's impossible to get figures about how many trans men in the UK want to be pregnant, or go through pregnancy. The handful of gender identity clinics in the UK won't give out statistics, although one consultant psychiatrist says the figure is ""tiny"". Only one transgender man in the UK, Hayden Cross, has spoken publicly about his pregnancy. Cross had hoped to freeze his eggs before completing his transition, but when the National Health Service refused to pay he decided to get pregnant with donor sperm and temporarily put gender reassignment surgery on hold. I spoke to another trans man, Freddy McConnell, who has thought about what he might do if and when he wants his own children. Find us on Facebook,external He's not ready to start a family yet, but if and when the time comes, he says carrying the baby will certainly be an option. He identifies as a gay man and has a partner who describes themselves as non-binary. ""That means that they don't identify as a male or a female - but they are on the masculine side of the spectrum,"" Freddy says. Freddy, 30, made the physical transition from female to male four years ago with the help of testosterone. Even now he gets testosterone injections once every 12 weeks. He also had an operation performed in the States which removed his breasts and gave him a male, contoured chest. But crucially he didn't have ""lower"" (genital) surgery, and that means that he has some options when it comes to having a family. ""I've always wanted kids and a family and I've thought about this a lot,"" he says. ""When trans men wants to have kids and they're on testosterone, they have to come off it. Then you'd have to wait for your menstruation cycle to kick in, and hopefully you'll be able to conceive. If you don't, it may be because you have a pre-existing fertility issue."" But stopping your testosterone is risky for a trans man because it could lead to gender dysphoria - described by the Terence Higgins Trust as an intense feeling of sadness, low mood and uncertainty. Often this is what causes a person to transition in the first place, and for Freddy, it's a real concern. ""A lot of the changes that testosterone makes to your body are permanent. So, if you came off testosterone your voice wouldn't become high again and you wouldn't lose your facial hair,"" Freddy says. ""But the things that can change back once your system is running on oestrogen again is your fat distribution and muscle growth, and that could cause dysphoria and be challenging. ""If I was going to carry a baby that would worry me, because I really like the physical changes that testosterone has given me. ""It makes life a lot easier for me to be 'read' as male all the time, and I worry about losing that and the security it gives me in my identity."" This video can not be played Listen to Freddy on Woman's Hour Freddy acknowledges that there aren't many people like him in the UK. ""The trans community is small, the trans male community is smaller and then the number of trans men who've had babies is vanishingly small,"" he says. This means that social media sites, particularly from America or Canada, are particularly useful when it comes to getting information, providing support and sharing feelings. ""People who've been through this experience talk about feeling worried, and they're frightened that they'll be judged,"" says Freddy. ""And so they look to the community itself for information. That's where you know that people won't talk in a way that's disrespectful and won't be shocked, and they'll use inclusive language."" So when it comes to the BMA advice about referring to ""pregnant people"" instead of ""expectant mothers"" Freddy feels it's uncontroversial and factually correct. ""What they're saying in this document is: 'If you're talking to a trans man or an intersex man about being pregnant, don't call him an expectant mother.' ""If you call me that, it's incorrect and it's going to make me feel like you're not talking about me, you don't see me, you don't get where I'm coming from and I wonder where it is going to leave me as a patient under your care. It signals rigidity and closed-mindedness. ""But it's really important to say we're not interested in redefining motherhood, or taking away that word. We're just trying to be seen.""

What you need to know about Francois Fillon,"Mr Fillon said his enemies were trying to ""take me down, through Penelope"" He was once the favourite to win the French presidency, but centre-right candidate FranÃ§ois Fillon's fortunes have been dramatically dented by a ""fake jobs"" row. His Welsh-born wife, Penelope, has become caught up in a controversy surrounding her work as a parliamentary assistant. As the presidential race hots up, Mr Fillon, a one-time prime minister, is under judicial investigation and has spoken of a ""political assassination"". Nothing, say FranÃ§ois Fillon and his wife, who insist everything was above board. But prosecutors have decided there is sufficient evidence to open a full judicial inquiry into abuse of public funds and the examining magistrate has placed both under formal investigation. The question is: did Penelope Fillon do the work she was paid for? Satirical weekly Le Canard EnchaÃ®nÃ© alleged in late January that she did not - and got â¬831,400 (Â£710,000; $900,000) for her trouble. She was employed as her husband's parliamentary assistant from 1988-90 and again in 1998-2002 and then by his successor as an MP, Marc Joulaud, from 2002-2007. He too has been placed under formal investigation. Penelope Fillon worked again for her husband from 2012-13. That would all be very well if she actually did the work, but reports suggest she did not have a parliamentary pass or a work email. For the past two weeks, Le Canard EnchaÃ®nÃ© has carried revelations about the Fillon family's earnings The allegations do not stop there. According to Le Canard, Mrs Fillon also pocketed â¬100,000 for writing just a handful of articles for a literary review La Revue des Deux Mondes,owned by a billionaire friend of the family, Marc Ladreit de LacharriÃ¨re. Mr Fillon is also being investigated for allegedly failing to declare a tax-free â¬50,000 loan from the billionaire which he has since repaid. The inquiry widened in March to include two luxury suits worth some â¬13,000 that were bought for him by a friend. It has also emerged he accepted two watches worth more than â¬10,000 apiece. And then there are the children. Mr Fillon will have to explain why Marie and Charles Fillon were paid by their father's office for legal work. Le Canard alleges they were not yet qualified lawyers. Mr Fillon, 62, said initially that he would resign if he was placed under formal investigation. And yet he is fighting on regardless, arguing that he is being unfairly targeted. ""The closer we get to the date of the presidential election, the more scandalous it would be to deprive the right and centre of a candidate,"" he said. That change of mind prompted key allies to abandon him. But when Bordeaux Mayor Alain JuppÃ© ruled himself out as a replacement the party leadership swung behind Mr Fillon. Opinion polls however suggest the one-time favourite for the presidency is now third in the race and unlikely to reach the second round on 7 May. If somehow he were to make the runoff, he could still win the race. Bordeaux Mayor Alain Juppe said Mr Fillon's campaign had reached a ""dead end"" but refused to stand in his place Fillon takes populist tone in bid to fight back Fillon under pressure to pull out Who is Francois Fillon? FranÃ§ois Fillon has complained of an ""institutional coup d'Ã©tat"" orchestrated by the left, and of a ""black cabinet"" going all the way to the current president, FranÃ§ois Hollande. There may well have been a campaign to target him, and where Le Canard sourced its information is unclear. But the judiciary is pushing ahead with a full inquiry. Mr Fillon is under formal investigation for abuse of public funds and receiving bribes. Penelope Fillon is being investigated for complicity. Mr Fillon complains of a ""political assassination"", and of being in the cross-hairs of magistrates and media. He will need more than rhetoric to help his campaign. Mr Fillon tweeted: ""Never has an operation of such size been launched to try to eliminate a candidate other than by the democratic process"" When summoned by investigating magistrates, Mr Fillon refused to answer questions but read a statement denying the allegations against him and his wife. ""Yes I employed my wife and the reality of her work is undeniable,"" he told them. ""Throughout these years, my wife worked by my side and by the side of my successor to ensure perfect continuity."" Asked by French TV about the work that his wife had done, he said: ""She corrected my speeches, she received countless guests, she represented me in protests, she passed on people's requests... she did it willingly for years."" Penelope Fillon said in an interview,externalthat her husband ""needed someone to carry out his tasks. If it hadn't been me, he would have paid someone else to do it, so we decided that it would be me"". Family lawyer Antonin LÃ©vy explained that Mr Fillon had no constituency office so Penelope Fillon fulfilled the role from home. The Fillons' lawyers have reiterated the family's innocence, promising that it would be recognised eventually by independent judges. Well, yes he does. It is really not unusual for French MPs to employ a member of their own family. French website Mediapart worked out that 115 out of 577 MPs did just that, either on a full- or part-time basis. And in France there is nothing illegal about it, assuming they actually do the work. What might prove awkward is that few people have any recollection of Mrs Fillon doing any work. Andremarks she made in 2007 to the Sunday Telegraph,externaldo little to help. ""I've never been his assistant or anything of that kind... I didn't handle his PR either."" Mr Fillon dismissed the remarks as out of context, and said first and foremost she had been a partner rather than a subordinate. Michel CrÃ©pu, an ex-editor of the literary review that apparently paid her â¬100,000, told Le Canard EnchaÃ®nÃ© that she published two or three literary reviews but he had never met her and ""never seen her in the office"". In her defence, Penelope Fillon said she ""produced reading notes"" for the review's owner. The Republicans appear in disarray and FranÃ§ois Fillon's main rivals in the presidential race are the clear winners so far. One is far-right National Front leader Marine Le Pen, who has her own ""fake jobs"" row to deal with. The FN is under investigation for alleged misuse of EU funds andMs Le Pen has refused a police interviewbecause she has immunity as a member of the European Parliament. At least three FN officials, including her personal assistant, are under judicial investigation in France over the affair. So the rival with perhaps most to gain is Emmanuel Macron, the centrist, young ex-economy minister, who has come from nowhere and is neck and neck in the polls with Marine Le Pen for the first round on 23 April. If Francois Fillon fails to make the run-off, then he would be favourite to win the presidency. Can Francois Fillon survive to contest French election?

Nowell missed two days of training this week for personal reasons. Maro Itoje will start a Test for the first time on the flank, and is named alongside Tom Wood and Nathan Hughes in the back row. Joe Launchbury and Courtney Lawes start in the second row, after George Kruis was ruled out with a knee injury. Hughes is at number eight in place of the injured Billy Vunipola while prop Joe Marler, who has recovered froma fractured leg,starts. Flanker James Haskell is among the replacements. Daly, who has also played at centre for England, wassent off on his last appearance for his countryagainst Argentina in December, having started the previous Autumn Internationals against South Africa and Fiji. ""Elliot did superbly for us in the autumn,"" said England coach Eddie Jones. ""He's got genuine pace and can play as a third centre. Jack's absence had nothing to do with selection."" Six questions for Eddie Jones to tackle Get rugby news as it happens by signing up for our new alerts BBC coverage of the 2017 Six Nations Matt Dawson scored 12 - can you beat him on our rugby quiz? There are eight changes from the starting line-up that sealedEngland's first clean sweep of the Six Nationsin 13 years when the teams met in Paris in March. Mako Vunipola (knee) and Chris Robshaw (shoulder) are unlikely to play a part in England's title defence, while winger Anthony Watson (hamstring) andsecond row Kruis (knee)have been sidelined for the tournament opener. Despite the disruption to his preparations, Jones wants his side to take risks. This video can not be played Six Nations tries of the tournament ""In rugby terms you've traditionally got two contrasting styles - French flair and England's dogged conservative approach, but we want to be absolutely daring against the French in this first game and set the standard for the tournament,"" he said. Wales make five changes for trip to Italy Strauss in for Scotland to play Ireland Henderson and O'Brien in Ireland team ""Guy Noves likes a big team. He picks a traditional French forward pack with squat front-rowers who scrummage well, big locks who give a lot of ballast and athletic back-rowers. ""It's based on size and crunching that gain line, getting an offload and then playing with flair. ""Of course, this gives you an opportunity when you've got a big forward pack against you and we intend to exploit that."" England's attacking threat was evident in the series whitewash of Australia in the summer and the autumn internationals, scoring 35 or more points in five of their past seven games. However, despite 13 straight victories since taking charge last year, Jones has toldhis team to be tighter in defence.,external 5 live rugby commentator Chris Jones Jack Nowell has been in outstanding form for his club Exeter this season, but after missing Tuesday's training session he has to make do with a place on the bench as the versatile Elliot Daly starts. Maro Itoje's selection on the flank is eye-catching, as is James Haskell's return to the squad after his long injury lay-off. And while George Kruis' injury is a blow, England are extremely well-stocked in the second row, with Joe Launchbury and Courtney Lawes a high-quality pairing. England team to face France:Mike Brown; Jonny May, Jonathan Joseph, Owen Farrell, Elliot Daly; George Ford, Ben Youngs; Joe Marler, Dylan Hartley (captain), Dan Cole; Joe Launchbury; Courtney Lawes; Maro Itoje, Tom Wood, Nathan Hughes. Replacements:Jamie George, Matt Mullan, Kyle Sinckler, Teimana Harrison, James Haskell, Danny Care, Ben Te'o, Jack Nowell. France start with six players beaten by Jones' side in Paris during March. The loss of Wesley Fofana to a torn achilles will see Gael Fickou switch roles, while there will be a focus on 22-year-old Baptiste Serin, playing his first Six Nations game at scrum-half. Serin has captained his country at under-20 level and impressed in his early outings for Les Bleus at senior level. Flanker Kevin Gourdon and loose-head prop Cyril Baille will also play in the competition for the first time as coach Guy Noves looks to improve on a fifth-placed finish last year in what is his second campaign in charge. France team to face England:Scott Spedding, Noa Nakaitaci, Remi Lamerat, Gael Fickou, Virimi Vakatawa, Camille Lopez, Baptiste Serin; Cyril Baille, Guilhem Guirado (captain), Uini Atonio, Sebastien Vahaamahina, Yoann Maestri, Damien Chouly, Kevin Gourdon, Louis Picamoles.

Rowling hits back over book burning threats,"Rowling has never shied away from expressing her political views on social media Harry Potter author JK Rowling has hit back at Twitter users who threatened to burn her books following her criticism of President Trump. Rowling's recent Twitter feed has been filled with her retweets criticising the president's recent travel ban. Some followers have taken umbrage with her stance, with several saying they have burned her books or plan to do so, and one suggesting she ""should stay out of politics"". But the novelist has proved a match for her critics with her mocking responses. Rowling has more than nine million followers on Twitter One Twitter user said they would now ""burn your books and movies, too"". Rowling hit back,external: ""Well, the fumes from the DVDs might be toxic and I've still got your money, so by all means borrow my lighter.""

Newcastle fan's 56-ticket Cup ride,"Mr Heywood posted a picture of his ticket bonanza on Twitter Newcastle United's army of fans is used to long journeys, and one found a way to cut the cost of a trip to Oxford - but it needed 56 separate rail tickets. Jonny Heywood booked split tickets from Tyneside for the Magpies' fourth round FA Cup clash last weekend. Mr Heywood said he saved Â£56 by not buying one ticket for the whole trip - but was left with a stack of seat reservations and returns. He and his girlfriend were left juggling 28 tickets each. In his tweet, Mr Heywood, of Washington, jokingly thanked his friend for the""worst advice"" he said he had ever received,external. The tweet prompted other people to tell of their own thriftiness, including a football fan who posted a picture of a mound of tickets for a trip to see Southampton, which he said saved him Â£30. Split tickets can save passengers money as separate fares for each leg of a journey - all on the same train - are sometimes cheaper than one ticket covering the entire trip. On Wednesday, the Rail Delivery Group (RDG) which represents train operators announced a trial of a scheme that willautomatically offer the cheapest possible fareto passengers. As for Mr Heywood, although he saved money he had to endure a3-0 pummellingat the hands of League One Oxford. Have you ever bought a similar number of tickets to make a rail journey?

Police blow up car parked by own officers,"The car was parked outside Workington police station after the owner had taken ill A police force carried out a controlled explosion on a ""suspicious"" car outside a station, not realising its own officers had parked it there. A bomb squad was called after concerns about an unattended Vauxhall Corsa at Workington police station, Cumbria. Roads around the building, in Hall Brow, were sealed off and an explosion carried out at 08:00 GMT. The force blamed ""an internal communications error"" and apologised to the owner. Cumbria Police said other officers on duty were not aware colleagues had parked the car outside the station after helping its owner, who had been taken ill. The building was evacuated, a 100m cordon put in place and the vehicle blown up. Insp Ashley Bennett said: ""We have made contact with the owner of the vehicle, explained the situation and have apologised to him.

Past the point of no-return,"It's begun. After decades of debate, years of acrimony over the issue in the Conservative Party, months of brutal brinksmanship in Westminster, and hours of debate this week, MPs have just approved the very first step in the process of Britain leaving the European Union. There are many hurdles ahead, probably thousands of hours of debate here, years of negotiations for Theresa May with our friends and rivals around the EU, as she seeks a deal - and possibly as long as a decade of administrative adjustments, as the country extricates itself from the EU. On a wet Wednesday, the debate didn't feel epoch-making, but think for a moment about what has just happened. MPs, most of whom wanted to stay in the EU, have just agreed that we are off. This time last year few in Westminster really thought that this would happen. The then prime minister's concern was persuading the rest of the EU to give him a better deal for the UK. His close colleagues believed the chances of them losing, let alone the government dissolving over the referendum, were slim, if not quite zero. Then tonight, his former colleagues are rubber stamping the decision of a narrow majority of the public, that changed everything in politics here for good. This isn't even the  last vote on this bill. There are several more stages, the Lords are likely to kick up rough at the start. But after tonight, for better or worse, few will believe that our journey to the exit door can be halted. As government ministers have said in recent days, the moment for turning back is past.

Hockney redesigns The Sun's logo,"Here's an exclusive first look at David Hockney's masthead for Friday's edition of the Sun. What do you think? Newspapers are forever doing cool stunts with their front pages and mastheads. When he was editor of the Independent (my former parish), Simon Kelner designed several memorable front pages, often with the help of celebrities such as Bono or Tracey Emin. In my time as editor we had the odd stunt too. They tended to be aimed at promoting charitable causes. Sometimes proceeds from the sale of the paper would go to charity. For the Sun on Friday, this is more about boosting circulation with a souvenir edition. For Hockney, it will help to raise awareness of his forthcoming exhibition at Tate Britain, which opens on 9 February. David Hockney's Sun logo in more detail For what it's worth, I think the redesigned logo is terrific. It is true to the essence of the original but takes it in a playful and childish (in the best sense of that word) direction. Hockney was photographed for Friday's edition in his Los Angeles studio by Arthur Edwards, the Sun's celebrated royal photographer. In my view, newspapers should do front page stunts much more often. They generally have a relationship with their readers that is sufficiently deep and trustful for them to get away with it - and they do have the habit of turning particular editions into souvenirs, which can help boost circulation and increase impact on our culture. Indeed the Sun's front page on the birth of Prince George was, to my mind,close to genius,external. Of course, editors have to decide how often is too often.

Our changing attitudes to chimpanzees,"The BBC's revelations about the illegal trade in baby chimpanzees triggered an outpouring of emotion on social media about the cruelty suffered by these adorable animals And this raises questions about how our attitudes to our closest relations in the natural world have changed. Some people who contacted me volunteered to adopt Nemley Jr, the infant rescued from traffickers after the BBC investigation. Many expressed outrage at the wealthy buyers in China, South East Asia and the Gulf states whose demand encourages poachers to go on raids in the jungles. There has also been a new burst of fury at celebrities posing with chimps. Michael Jackson famously kept one called Bubbles. Paris Hilton drew criticism for kissing a baby chimp. More recently, Louis Tomlinson, of One Direction, was criticised for using one in a video. And a small number on Twitter and Facebook were so disturbed by the heart-breaking scenes in our videos that they wanted to see anyone trading endangered animals immediately locked up or even killed. What this represents is the latest episode in a long and often shameful relationship between chimps and humans. Nemley Jr, the infant rescued from traffickers after the BBC investigation Strange though it seems, Neil Armstrong and Buzz Aldrin were able to become the first humans to walk on the Moon because of a legacy of rocket development that depended on chimpanzees. As it happens, the BBC's coverage of chimp trafficking aired on the very anniversary of the launch of Ham the Astrochimp, the first primate to reach orbit, back in January 1961. The secret trade in baby chimps: Full report He had been captured in the jungles of Cameroon, strapped into a Mercury rocket and blasted into an unknown still deemed too risky for people. He survived, but other space-faring chimps had a far tougher time. Enos, the second Nasa chimp sent into space, was given tasks to perform - and, if he got them wrong, his feet would be given a small electric shock. But the equipment malfunctioned,according to the account that emerged years later,external. So even when Enos performed properly, by pulling the correct levers when prompted, he was still electrocuted 33 times in all. None of this killed him, but his space capsule then landed off course. US astronaut Alan Shepard with chimpanzee Ham, who preceded him in space The truth was, chimps were deemed bright enough to stand in for people but were seen as expendable. Medical researchers also used to turn to chimps and other great apes to seek answers to fundamental questions about physiology and the brain. That work stopped in the UK many decades ago, and in several European countries more recently, but was phased out in the US only after a major scientific report in 2011 concluded there was no benefit from it. According to Sir Colin Blakemore, professor of neuroscience and philosophy at the University of London and a long-time defender of the use of animals in research, discoveries in the 1950s and 60s revealed how chimp brains were ""uncannily"" like ours. ""The structures, the folds, the similarity was amazing,"" he says. ""Great apes were being used as models for humans, but the model came back to bite the researchers because of that shocking similarity The more the brains of chimps and other great apes were seen to be like ours, the harder it became to justify conducting experiments on them, and a ban became the inevitable outcome. British primatologist Jane Goodall is perhaps the world's leading authority on chimpanzees Prof Blakemore lists a range of useful outcomes derived from research on chimps: the first, urgent, studies into HIV an early understanding of ovulation and immune systems a greater knowledge of the structures of the brain And he highlights the work on HIV - carried out under massive public pressure at the start of the Aids epidemic - as an example of an apocalyptic scenario that might conceivably justify the use of great apes in the years ahead. ""One could imagine that if the future of mankind is threatened by some terrible pathogen, then work on great apes might offer the possibility of saving the human race,"" he says. Another long-standing - and popular - use of chimps has been for entertainment. During our investigation, we heard of baby chimps performing in zoos in China. That sounds outrageous to us now, but the same happened for decades in the UK. Chimpanzee tea parties were a big attraction - and they were only phased out at Twycross Zoo in the 1970s. The zoo's chimps became famous for appearing in hugely popular TV commercials for the tea brand PG Tips. The last of the animals to feature on air, a female known as Choppers, died last year. Sharon Redrobe, the zoo's chief executive, says a change in attitudes came as zoos faced having to cope with older chimps disturbed by their experiences and as conservation became more of a priority. Two chimpanzees at a ""tea party"" at Whipsnade Zoo in April 1937 ""There's been a massive sea-change in the zoo community,"" she says. ""In the 80s, there was a wake-up call that we needed to be part of the solution not the problem."" And, looking ahead, she says, celebrities ""need to get the message that chimps don't make pets and that hugging them does them real harm"". For Will Travers, president of the Born Free Foundation, it was the growing scientific understanding of chimps - through the work of Jane Goodall and others - that turned opinion against exploiting the animals, and he gives a poignant example. ""There had been a misunderstanding that grimaces were smiles, but they were not,"" he says. ""We now know they represented fear. Enjoyment is the lips pressed together. This was a turning point. ""We've shot them into space, used them in experiments, dressed them up and pretended they're little humans, but the one thing we haven't done is the one thing they need: protection from us."" All eyes are now on the potential buyers of baby chimpanzees. China, a huge market for ivory, was persuaded to introduce a ban on it last Christmas, which could help choke off demand. The same kind of edict might help to save the chimpanzees as well.

The art of a President Trump state visit,"A current family fad is playing that word-association game in which you respond to the previous player's word with a relatable one of your own, eg me:      ""Annoying."" Son: ""Dad."" Wife: ""Bald eagle."" And so on. We've played a lot recently, such that I've started to react to the daily news in a similarly tangential way, where related but seemingly random thoughts pop into my head over and above more conspicuous concerns. For instance, while everybody else was discussing the significance of a potential state visit to the UK by President Trump, I had two immediate thoughts in my mind: He's going to absolutely love the White Drawing Room in Buckingham Palace What work of art might he bring as a gift for the Queen? No need to dwell on point one. One look at the photographs of Donald Trump's Manhattan Penthouse in Trump Tower confirms George IV's extravagant tastes and those of the current US President are simpatico. The art question is harder (should that be his choice of gift). As potentially treacherous presents go, giving a work of art to someone you don't know is right up there with buying underwear for a work colleague or deodorant for your mother-in-law: the likelihood of causing offence and/or embarrassment is high. Taste in art is a hard one to call, as the well-meaning Germans found out in 2015, when they attempted to combine their penchant for modernist expressionism with Her Majesty's passion for horses and family life. The Queen seemed bemused by the gift of a painting of her and her father, George VI It fell to President Joachim Gauck to present the painting by Nicole Leidenfrost to the Queen during her fifth state visit to Germany. The president stood proudly to the side of the easel on which the painting rested. It depicted the Queen as an eight-year-old girl sitting on a blue horse while her father, George VI, held its reins. Mr Gauck smiled enthusiastically, made a gesture with his left arm in a magician's ""ta-da"" sort of way, and invited the British monarch to inspect the splendid piece. The Queen's response was, shall we say, muted. She looked over to the Duke of Edinburgh with a bemused smile on her face and a question in her eye that appeared to be asking if this was a practical joke. Her husband leant in to look at the picture, held his position, and said nothing, leaving his wife with the task of filling the awkward silence. ""It's a strange colour for a horse,"" she said. The German president laughed charmingly but unconvincingly, as did others in attendance. ""And that's supposed to be my father, is it?"" Her Majesty enquired. The Trump Tower in New York was built on the site of an art-deco department store That hurt. But Mr Gauck remained calm and courteous and duly confirmed the figure on the left was meant to be her father. ""Don't you recognise him?"" asked Prince Philip encouragingly. ""No,"" replied the Queen. The chances of President Trump trotting off in the same direction and opting for a German expressionist aesthetic are slim. This is a man who once described a painting by Chris Ofili featuring the Virgin Mary amid cut-up backsides from pornographic magazines as ""degenerate,"" which is a loaded word to choose to describe an artwork, as it was so infamously used by the Nazis to describe Jewish and German expressionist paintings, which they exhibited and mocked in the 1937 Degenerate Art show. Art deco is out too, even though the American president is a New Yorker and has therefore spent his life surrounded by some the greatest examples of it in it the world. My grounds for this assertion go back to an incident in 1980 when he was about to demolish the Bonwit Teller Department Store on Manhattan's 5th Avenue in order to build Trump Tower. Before the wrecking balls swung into action, he was asked by the Metropolitan Museum of Art to save the art deco bas-reliefs on the building's facade. Newspaper reports from the time claim he said he would, but then he did not - later explaining to the press (having allegedly taken on the persona of an invented PR man called John Barron - a surname he would later give his son as a Christian name) there were too many health and safety issues to overcome. President Trump has inspired a number of works of art As for modern art, I think I can confidently say the president is not a huge fan on the whole. In his book Art of the Deal, he said: ""I've always felt a lot of modern art is a con."" This could explain why he missed out on what would have been a great art deal in 1981, when he rejected Andy Warhol's series of Trump Tower screen-prints the artist had made for him on spec (Warhol said: ""Mr Trump was very upset that it wasn't colour coordinated."") I think baroque could be his thing. It has everything he seems to like. It is big, sweeping, grand, historic and tumultuous. It has the Louis XIV kitschy campness he goes for. Better still, it is dramatic. President Trump is a showman; he understands the power of the spectacle. It is no surprise to me that he flirted with a career as a Broadway producer in his early 20s, and perfectly possible that he considers his work in property development as a more lucrative form of theatre, with his enormous buildings providing the set for urban dramas to unfold in and around. So, a baroque offering that is all about scale and showmanship - I suppose he could revisit his onetime collaboration with the Russian artist Zurab Tsereteli, whose colossal statue of Christopher Columbus he planned to make the totemic landmark of his West Side Yards development in New York. He told the New Yorker magazine in that ""it's got $40m [Â£30m] worth of bronze in it"" and the artist was ""major and legit"". Jeff Koons' sculpture Puppy. Might something like this grace Buckingham Palace? Most importantly perhaps, it was 6ft (1.8m) taller then the Statue of Liberty, itself a whopping work of art that was given to American by the French as a state gift. In the end, New York rejected Tsereteli's statue, so did Boston and Miami. It was finally erected in Puerto Rico last year. But that took years, and Donald Trump may have only months before his visit. So, what to do? Maybe he could pop round to Jeff Koons's studio in New York. Here is a contemporary American artist in touch with his baroque side, who has even exhibited at Versailles, and whose artistic vision is to ""communicate with the masses"" - a populist manifesto I imagine to be close to the president's heart. What's more, he makes massive sculptures and loves dogs nearly as much as the Queen. Proof for which can be found in his famous 40ft (12m) high plant-encrusted sculpture of a West Highland terrier puppy (1992), which he could reconceive in 2017 for the Queen as a 50ft (15m) high corgi that would take pride of place at the front of Buckingham Palace. Job done. Alternatively, the president could scale back on this ambitious plan and ask Koons to make a corgi doorstop instead. It might not generate the same amount of column inches, but at least it should receive a warmer welcome than the unfortunate blue horse.

'It's OK to feel sad',"The stigma around mental health problems can have a devastating impact on people's lives, a survey has found, often leaving behind a trail of break-ups, severed friendships and lost jobs. To get people talking and help break the stigma, charities have launched Time to Talk Day on Thursday. Here, eight people share their experiences. Diagnosis: Depression, anxiety and distress intolerance I've suffered since I was a young girl and always prided myself on how well I could hide my illness. I would lie to my school friends telling them I was on holiday when I was actually an in-patient. If I was not bubbly and sociable, my friends would say I was in ""death mode"". It made me feel very isolated. They're no longer my friends - just acquaintances. It has caused lasting damage and meant I always try to pretend I'm OK now. People need to understand that there's a spectrum of emotions - it's OK to feel happy, and it's OK to feel sad. Diagnosis: Borderline personality disorder At my worst, I was very erratic and hurtful. For my parents, it was like having an imposter in their home. My dad almost disowned me - he told me to snap out of it. Every time I had a bad day, he assumed I was suicidal or I was going to hurt someone. I think he was scared of the implications of having a child that would be ill for the rest of their life. It made me feel very unsupported, as though he did not accept me, so I moved out. It took three years to heal our relationship, and took for me to get worse and then better again for him to see that I could get better. I wish he had sat down with me and talked to me, rather than treat me like a burden. Diagnosis: Depression and anxiety My partner - and first love - was working in France. I had been struggling with the distance and my mind had started whirring with negative thoughts. She knew my history but thought it was in my past. A week before I was due to fly out to see her, she broke up with me over Skype. I blamed myself entirely for the split, and started thinking maybe I could never have a relationship. My family and friends are very supportive so it was hard not to get the support from someone I loved. I've tried to explain my anxiety to her in a letter and emails, but she hasn't replied. I'm very lucky to have a new partner now. She finds it really hard to fully understand my problems but she's read up on anxiety. It's about being there to listen - not judge. Diagnosis: Bipolar disorder I had a temper, I was uncontrollable but, for a long time, I just thought it was me. All my relationships in the past have broken down. It's been a nightmare. You get looked at in a different way from a ""normal"" person. Every argument is: ""Are you taking your medicine?"", ""You're a nutter."" It's very hard to explain what goes on in your mind. Some days can feel like your mind is a prison - you're trapped. My fiancee has experience of bipolar, and she's my rock. My advice to others in my position? Be open from the start. Some people won't be OK with it - you have to expect that. There's a lot of stigma in the world. Diagnosis: OCD previously, now depression and anxiety I chose not to tell my new employers about my mental health problems because I didn't want it to be a big deal. The job was stressful and I was signed off work. But when I returned and told them, no-one there knew what to do. At one point, my manager stopped talking to me, and an HR person said: ""If it's so awful here, why haven't you left?"" After six months, I was dismissed because my work was not up to standard, despite having told them I couldn't cope. But it was discrimination, and they got away with it. My new job has been a completely different experience. I told them, and even the senior bosses said their door was always open for a chat. It sounds silly but they've just been really nice about it. Diagnosis: Depression and anxiety When the illness was at its worst, I would come home from work very stressed out. I would find it difficult to talk about it and that would create a lot of tension. My wife and I would end up having arguments about trivial things, like what salad to have for dinner. It would happen in a flash and I would be in tears for several hours, and end up physically drained. For her, it was like being caught in a violent storm, and all she could do was take cover, and try to reassure me. It's so hard to live with someone who is mentally ill. The person you married has disappeared. She had got the worst of me. All they can do is continue to be there, and stay in it for the long haul. Diagnosis: Depression My wife and I divorced because of my mental health problems. After that, friends would assume I was down because of my divorce - and sometimes I was but it was also because of my mental health. I found it very hard to sit down and say all that to them. You would be exposing a part of yourself. When I opened up to one friend, she said: ""What have you got to be depressed about?"" I've told plenty of lies over the years to explain my absence - a stomach ache or my car's broken down. Recently I told a friend the truth - that I wasn't coming out because of my mental state. He texted back saying: ""Thanks for telling me. I'll be there when you need me. Man hugs."" Patience is good. Mood self-assessment: Could I be depressed? What is mental health? Diagnosis: Bipolar type two and borderline personality disorder I kept it a secret for a long time because I was afraid how my friends would react. At 18, I opened up. Some were supportive. Others seemed to want to blame me, saying it was my fault and if only I tried harder then I would be fine. I was really upset because it had taken me so long to build up the courage. It's as though they threw it back in my face, and I closed up again. It was three years before I opened up again - and this time it's been very different. Maturity and education make the difference. It's important to realise that everyone's mental health is different. If you want to help, you need to ask that individual how you can help. Don't be scared to approach the subject. We're not after a therapist, we're after a friend. And if you're the one opening up, expect people to be upset or shocked. They react like that because they care. Mental health charities are calling it Time to Talk Day on Thursday, in a bid to get people across England talking about mental health problems and help break the stigma. To coincide with a big conversation in schools, universities, councils, government departments and on social media, it has released findings from a survey of 2,000 adults with a range of mental health problems. The poll found almost two fifths (38%) had been treated negatively because of their problems. Of those: Nearly one in five (19%) lost their job Over half (54%) lost contact with a loved one And 55% stopped socialising or going out Sue Baker, director of organisers Time to Change, said: ""Progress is being made in improving attitudes and reducing discrimination in some key areas of life but too many of us are still being made to feel isolated, ashamed and worthless by other people's reactions. ""The good news is that being open about mental health, and ready to listen, can make a positive difference and potentially change lives.""

A painful goodbye,"Charlotte and Attila Szakacs, from York, spent 16 days with their daughter Evelyn after she died Charlotte and Attila Szakacs only had four weeks with their daughter, Evelyn, before a rare chromosomal abnormality led to her death. Yet they were able to spend a further 16 days bonding with her before laying her to rest. ""I know it might not be the best option for everyone,"" Charlotte told theDaily Mail,external. ""But for us it was so important to be able to have that family time and just properly cuddle our little girl."" For the Szakacs family, that option was a cuddle cot, enabling them to stay together for a longer period after Evelyn's death. The cots are refrigerated Moses baskets that create a cool environment for the child's body. By using it, Charlotte and Attila were able to stay in Martin House Children's Hospice, near Leeds, for 12 days, spending that time holding Evelyn, dressing her and even taking her for walks in a pram. The couple then made the choice to take their baby home for another four days, before holding a funeral. ""I think having the time with her made such a difference,"" added Charlotte. ""Being able to do so many of the things you imagine like taking her out in her pram, it really helped emotionally."" Although hospitals and hospices only began using them around five years ago, the cots have already made big impact on bereaved families. ""It helps them to create memories,"" says Dr Michelle Hills, consultant in paediatric palliative medicine at Martin House. ""Some families want to push their baby in the pram they have bought, take them home to the nursery they have prepared. For some, it helps them in the bereavement process."" Medical staff also offer parents the option of taking pictures of their baby, footprints and handprints, and creating memory boxes. Getting these mementoes of their child can be important for some families to help them with the grieving process. And for some parents, taking their child home after they die is another method of helping them to cope with their grief.

Dr Hills says the 16 days Charlotte and Attila decided to have was one of the longer periods she had come across, but the decision was up to each individual family. ""The important thing is there are choices available,"" she says. ""Some people couldn't imagine taking their child home, some people want to stay in hospital, others want to use a hospice. ""It is absolutely devastating losing a child. We are there to help them with everything, from creating those memories to organising a funeral."" According to stillbirth and neonatal death charity Sands, 15 babies die every day either before, during or shortly after birth. ""That is 15 families all affected by that every single day,"" says Erica Stewart, bereavement support and awareness specialist for the charity. ""People don't realise it is that number and we need to address that."" The charity echoes the words of Dr Hills, saying what is important is that each family gets to choose how they want to proceed when a child dies. ""It is the approach staff take too,"" she says. ""If they approach a family, tell them something like a cuddle cot has helped others through that time, then it normalises it."" This video can not be played Beckie Wilson was able to spend three days with her son Carter, who died shortly after he was born. But in some cases, funding makes it more difficult. ""There is an issue as you could find two babies who die on the same day, but there is only one cuddle cot and only one family has that option,"" says Ms Stewart. ""We have seen a number of families who have used cuddle cots go out afterwards and fundraise to make sure more are available."" But whatever families decide on in the immediate aftermath of the loss, the pain does not stop there. Ms Stewart says: ""A lot of parents feel isolated when they have lost a child and people are too worried to talk to them about it. ""They have not forgotten that child, it never goes away and we need to make sure we talk about it more. ""If you know someone who has lost their baby, drop them a text, give them a call, offer to do something for them like walk the dog or take their other kids to school. They will appreciate it."" Dolisten to what parents say about their loss - a parent's love for their baby can not be measured in weeks or months Douse the baby's name if they have chosen one Dooffer hugs to dads as well as mums, if it feels right to do so Doget in touch to stop them feeling isolated Don'tavoid bereaved parents because you feel uncomfortable or awkward Don'tsuggest what a bereaved parent should be feeling or doing. Everyone grieves in their own way Don'tstop supporting the parents after a few days or weeks Don'tassume that a new pregnancy or a new baby will cancel out the grief of the earlier loss.

"'Legal, but immoral'","Katie Kendrick says she was originally told her home's freehold would cost between Â£2,000 and Â£4,000 When putting pen to paper to buy a new home, most people expect to know how much they will need to pay to own it outright. But thousands of families in England and Wales are discovering the new-build houses they bought are not all they seemed. Katie Kendrick bought her new-build home from Bellway in Ellesmere Port, Cheshire, three years ago for Â£214,000. ""It was supposed to be our forever home,"" she tells theBBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, sitting in the living room of her four-bedroom house. ""But it's the biggest mistake I've ever made."" Katie knew the house was leasehold - meaning she owned the property for the 150-year length of her lease agreement - but claims she was told by the sales representative that because of the long lease it was ""as good as freehold""; a property owned outright. She thought nothing of it, and says she was told she would be able to buy her freehold after two years, believing it would cost between Â£2,000 and Â£4,000. But a year and a half later, she received a letter from Bellway saying her freehold had been sold to an investment company, which was now quoting Â£13,300 for her to buy it. ""At the moment I feel completely blind and in a corner and don't know which way to turn. There's legal action but that is very costly,"" she says. A freeholder of a property owns it outright, including the land it is built on. Most houses are freehold but some might be leasehold - usually through shared-ownership schemes. With a leasehold, the person owns the property for the length of their lease agreement with the freeholder. Leaseholders have to pay their freeholders ground rent and other fees in order to make changes to their homes. When the lease ends, ownership returns to the freeholder unless the person can extend the lease. Some wish to buy their freeholds to save themselves these costs. Source: The Money Advice Service What Bellway has done - selling a new home as leasehold, and then selling the freehold separately to an investment company without informing the family living there - is not illegal. In England and Wales, the ""right of first refusal"" applies to flats, but not houses. So it was not legally obliged to tell Katie it would do this. For an investment company, buying groups of freeholds is a safe long-term investment. Receiving regular payments for ground rents - over leases that number well over 100 years - means safe, steady incomes, to fund things like pensions. The campaign group Leasehold Knowledge Partnership estimates this business is worth up to Â£500m to the developers each year. The leasehold system has existed for a long time in England and Wales, especially in blocks of flats. Many leaseholders have long leases, for example for 999 years, and experience no problems. But the trend for new-build houses being sold as leasehold has accelerated in recent years. While not all house builders use this model, those that do argue it helps make developments financially viable. But nowhere on Bellway's website is this system made clear to potential buyers, and Katie feels these facts were not made clear to her. She also says the solicitor - recommended to her by Bellway - made no mention of this possibility either. Katie says because she bought the house through the government's Help To Buy scheme, she felt she could trust the process. Bellway has not responded to requests for comment. Homeground - the company that now manages Katie's freehold on behalf of the investment company - said in a statement it ""can usually informally negotiate a price which can often save both time and some of the professional fees"". ""In the rare event we cannot agree, the leaseholder still retains the right to turn to the statutory process, which will establish the price as well as the legal fees they have to pay."" It's likely thousands of homeowners could be in a similar position to Katie. Lindsay, who lives on the same estate, bought a house from developers Taylor Wimpey. The company did ask Lindsay if she wanted to buy her freehold - for Â£2,600. She declined because she was on maternity leave and felt financially it was not possible. Two years later she asked about buying it but found it was now Â£32,000. ""I rang them and said, 'I'd like to buy it now.' And they said, 'It's not for sale - there's a private investor who owns it. They've got a long-term interest in your property,'"" Lindsay explains. ""I turned around and said, 'I've got a long-term interest in my property. It's my family home, it's my son's inheritance, and it's not yours to just line your pockets with.' ""I feel like I've let everybody down because it wasn't right to buy it when it came. But nobody said this was a one-time offer. ""It might be legal, but it's not even questionable that it's immoral,"" she adds. Watch theVictoria Derbyshire programmeon weekdays between 09:00 and 11:00 on BBC Two and the BBC News channel. Taylor Wimpey said as it no longer owned the freehold to Lindsay's house, it did not set the price of the freehold or benefit from the ground rent. It added that, since the start of this year, houses on its new developments would be sold as freehold-only, except in a small number of cases where it did not own the freehold to the land. But other developers are still selling new-build houses as leasehold. Katie and Lindsay do have the option to negotiate with the companies who own their freeholds, but say they do not wish to go down this route. They feel the original prices should still stand. The law does allow a leaseholder to force their freeholder to sell after two years - if both sides cannot agree a price, a tribunal will decide how much the leaseholder should pay. However, the leaseholder can also be liable for the legal fees of both parties, meaning further expense to people like Katie and Lindsay. A spokesman for the Department of Communities and Local Government has told the BBC ""it is unacceptable if home buyers are being exploited with unfair charges and unfavourable ground rent agreements prior to purchase. ""We are aware of this issue and will announce radical proposals to reset the housing market in our forthcoming White Paper."" Beth Rudolf, from the Conveyancing Association, says that if the developers were not clear about the leaseholds, it may be a case of misrepresentation. ""Anyone marketing a property is covered by consumer unfair trading regulations, which means that if there is anything that would affect their decision-making process, then they should be advised of that before viewing the property,"" she says. Beth Rudolf believes developers should be clear about the leaseholds from the start ""It's too late when they move into the house to find that out, it's too late when they become legally liable to purchase it. ""It's too late really at the point when they've viewed it, because they've already fallen in love with it."" The fight goes on for Katie and Lindsay, who worry their homes are now ""unsellable"" while this shadow hangs over them. ""Hindsight's a wonderful thing,"" says Lindsay. ""I wouldn't have done it if I had known.""

Survival tactics,"This video can not be played The decline of coal has led to a revival of rural traditions in Asturias The sons and daughters of miners in the deserted coalfields of northern Spain face two choices: leave to find work, or innovate to be able to stay. Now, they have developed an online barter economy, which they say is helping them return to their rural roots. But can it really work? Javi Fernandez's small house is surrounded by edible plants. Among traditional winter crops grown in this area, like verza, a kind of cabbage, there's also mustard, Jerusalem artichokes, and shiitake mushrooms. It's a small patch of bounty amid miles of empty, rolling hills. Rather than study engineering to work in the coal mines like both his father and grandfather, Mr Fernandez studied agriculture in Cuba. ""I couldn't afford to go to a paying university so I studied for free at the ISCA University, in San Jose de las Lajas,"" he beams, digging through the 400 sq m (4,300 sq ft) of artichokes he has planted. Asturias became a centre for coal production in Spain in the late 19th Century, but waves of closures have left whole towns deserted and hundreds of thousands of miners unemployed. And the EU is ending all subsidies for the coalfields by 2018, sounding the death knell for the industry in the region. Cultivating mushrooms enables Javi Fernandez to get things he needs through barter Javi brings a range of produce to market, thanks to skills he learnt in Cuba Javi Fernandez uses a traditional Asturian technique to grow his mushrooms: harvesting branches from the forest, drilling small holes and impregnating them with spores, before covering the holes in beeswax and leaving them in the dark for a year. Then he makes shiitake pate, dries and cures the mushrooms, and powders them so they can be taken in pill form. For all his work, he earned no money at all until recently. Instead, he put his produce into an online barter economy, trading it for other things he needs. ""Up in the mountains there's a serious liquidity problem,"" he says. ""People find it easier to barter because money simply isn't available."" Twice a month, he takes his produce to a local village market, with a sale already agreed online. Other young people, also trying to survive in the mountains, come with a wide range of offers, from building, teaching and manual labour to giving legal advice and translation. Spain is far from the only country where barter is gaining traction at the margins of the economy. Greek community experiments with barter currency Brazilian barter website turns time into money Barter is probably the oldest form of commerce, involving trade of goods or services with no money involved. And in this area of northern Spain, networks such as Rastru have developed that allow users to go online to match offers and needs, in a digital twist on an ancient tradition. The system adopted by Rastru - which stands for Asturian network of barter communities - equates one trade-point known as a ""copin"" to one euro. It enables users to barter directly, or rack up the digital currency to get goods and services from others in the community. To attract business, users can also deal in a mix of euros and points. Asturias miners saw the pits close, leaving a tough legacy for their children Asturias is littered with relics of its coal-mining heyday ""Barter means you can leave the bureaucracy alone, and that people who wouldn't otherwise have access to money have a way of surviving in the countryside,"" says Sergio Palacio Martin, who helped found the initiative and is also the son of a miner. ""The first stories that appeared about what's happening said we were all hippies. Now they're calling us entrepreneurs."" Across Asturias there are 78 municipalities, divided into nodes, he explains. Each one works autonomously. Since it started four years ago, nearly 1,500 users have shifted â¬350,000 (Â£300,000; $375,000) of produce between them. An old photo of Asturias miners: Coal was an integral part of everyday life Until the mid-19th Century, most people from Asturias lived in smallholdings similar to that of Javi Fernandez. As coal and steel mining took hold, rural areas were abandoned and the central cities and industrial centres became overpopulated. But Mr Fernandez says that has all changed and speaks of a big movement. ""People from Asturias are returning to the mountains. They are having to learn about their rural environment, because there's nothing else for them, there's no work."" Violeta is happy that local people are returning to their rural roots Further up the mountain, Violeta cuts pumpkins and turnips for a stew she's making for her kids. ""It's not really new, this movement to the countryside,"" she says. ""People were already rural, but then they moved to the city. Now a generation's moving back. It's just another episode; a return to their roots."" And there are opportunities here too. Asturias boasts 200,000 hectares of virgin, chestnut forest - Europe's biggest, says Javi. For now, the chestnuts drop to the ground and are eaten by wild boars. The mild climate and rich soil are good for farming. ""We have all we need here,"" says Violeta. ""We came to make a future for ourselves, because in the city the future's dark and there are no possibilities. Here the possibilities are endless. There's forest, there's water, there's sun. We have what we want. "" The bartering activity is modest, and will not provide a lasting solution to these young people's problems. But it is a start and offers a chance to navigate a period of uncertainty and industrial decline.

Kris quits Paradise role - but who's replacing him?,"Kris Marshall said his family were unable to join him to film the current series Working for six months a year on a Caribbean island might sound like the dream job - but now Kris Marshall, the star of BBC One's Death in Paradise, has decided to leave the show. Marshall has played DI Humphrey Goodman on the detective drama, which is filmed on Guadeloupe, for four years. The actor, who made his name on sitcom My Family, said he wanted to spend more time with his wife and young children. A new detective will arrive in his place, played by Ardal O'Hanlon. O'Hanlon is best known for his roles in Father Ted and My Hero. Ardal O'Hanlon will arrive as DI Jack Mooney In a BBC press release, Kris Marshall said: ""Death in Paradise has been an incredible experience, six months every year filming on a tropical island in the sunshine - what's not to love! ""Humphrey was socially awkward and clumsy but also brilliant, I'll miss him but it's time to hand over to someone new and spend more time with my family. ""I know Ardal will do a superb job and I just hope Humphrey gets a happy ending!"" Marshall's character will be seen for the final time when the show's sixth series ends on Thursday 9 February. He has said this was the first series where his family didn't join him in Guadeloupe for the filming. He and wife Hannah have a four-year-old son Thomas and a younger daughter, Elsie. ""We did Skype about once a week,""he told The Sun,externalabout filming the current series. ""But my son got bored very quickly. It's like: 'Seeing your face is one thing, but if you can't play with me then you're no real use to me so I'm gonna go off and do something else.' ""You just end up coming off FaceTime feeling quite bereft and actually quite empty."" In 2015, before Elsie was born,he told Radio Times,external: ""I'm not sure I could do the show if my son and my wife weren't with me."" O'Hanlon will be seen as Marshall's replacement, playing DI Jack Mooney, on Thursday's episode (2 February), and will take over as the main detective on the sun-drenched, murder-afflicted fictional island of Saint Marie next year. O'Hanlon said: ""I am delighted to be joining Death in Paradise and exploring what's made Mooney up and leave London for a life in the Caribbean. I've already had a taste of filming in Guadeloupe and can't wait to get back."" An average of 8.7 million viewers watched the first three episodes of the current series.

Rejoice and revolts as 'Brexit begins',"""We have lift-off"" is the Daily Mail's front page headline on Wednesday night's Brexit vote in the Commons. It describes the vote - by 498 to 114 -  as a ""crushing majority"" to start the formal process of leaving the European Union. Its front page - complete with union flags, a picture of Sir Winston Churchill's statue and Big Ben - heralds a ""momentous day for Britain"". The Daily Telegraph, meanwhile, says the period of ""phoney Brexit"" is now over, adding that at the point of the vote ""our bridges were burned and there's no way back"". The paper's editorial goes on to say there is ""no point pretending that the process is going to be straightforward"". It adds that one ambition must be to ""avoid it seriously damaging relations with the rest of Europe"". The Financial Times reports,externalthat even as Theresa May celebrated victory, there were warnings of the difficulties to come from her former EU ambassador, Ivan Rogers. He said resolving demands from Brussels for a Â£60bn exit payment could descend into name-calling and a diplomatic ""fist-fight"". The Guardian is one of a number of papers to highlight the split that has emerged in the Labour Party - with more than a fifth of its MPs defying Jeremy Corbyn's orders and voting against the Brexit legislation. The paper's editorial,externalsays the party's difficulties were ""etched"" on the face of shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer, as he wove his way through what it called the ""mess of conflicting ambitions that constitute current party policy"". The editorial says: ""We would rather that the party had voted with its heart than, as it perhaps did, with an eye on its electoral prospects in leave areas like Stoke and Copeland."" Away from the Brexit debate, UKIP could face a Â£500,000 bill over claims it misused EU cash,according to the Times,external. The paper says Nigel Farage, Paul Nuttall and six other party MEPs are under investigation. It adds that they could be told to pay back the money if their full time European parliamentary assistants were found to have also been working for a national party. A UKIP spokesman has rejected the allegations. Several papers, includingthe i newspaper,externalandthe Guardian,externalhave a picture of the party's former leader Nigel Farage speaking at the European parliament yesterday. Also visible in the photo is the Labour MEP Seb Dance. He is holding up a piece of paper with an arrow pointing towards Mr Farage with the words ""he's lying to you"". The Telegraph reports thata major overhaul of the Official Secrets Act,externalis under way in the face of what it calls a ""growing threat from Russia"". Spies and civil servants who leak secrets would face up to 14 years in jail, according to the paper. It says the proposals aim to replace existing laws with a modern espionage act and a data disclosure law. Under the new system, foreign spies who steal information from government departments and leak it - or those who snoop on British embassies - would face prosecution in British courts for the first time.

'Please value life',"Ms Chien and her dog, Egg Yolk A new law banning animal euthanasia is set to take force in Taiwan. It comes almost a year after the shocking suicide of a vet overwhelmed by grief at the plight of stray animals. The BBC's Cindy Sui explores this tragedy. Perhaps veterinarian and animal lover Chien Chih-cheng was in the wrong job at the wrong time. ""She often worked overtime, rarely took a proper lunch break, and sacrificed her holidays to give the dogs more attention and make their lives better,"" Winnie Lai, her colleague at a shelter for abandoned dogs in Taoyuan City, remembers. As a graduate of Taiwan's top university with the highest score in a civil service examination, Ms Chien could have chosen a desk job at head office, but opted to personally care for the many pets abandoned each year in Taiwan. The shelter's lobby was decorated with pictures of animals drawn by Ms Chien to encourage adoptions, but many of them were destined to be put down. On 5 May last year, Ms Chien took her own life, using the same drug she used to put down animals. She said she wanted to help people understand what happens to strays in Taiwan. The shelter Ms Chien worked at finds homes for most of its animals Taiwan was gripped by anger and soul-searching in the weeks that followed, most of it focused on a life tragically cut short. But people also asked why frontline workers in Taiwan's battle against pet abandonment were being put under so much pressure. Physie: Discover a uniquely Australian sport Lychees 'behind deaths of India children' Has 'tree syndrome' affected young girl? In an interview Ms Chien once did with a local TV station CTI, she described the first time she saw an animal put down. ""I went home and cried all night,"" she said. But it was media appearances like this that meant she came under personal attack. When it was revealed she had put down 700 dogs in two years, she was labelled the ""beautiful slaughterer"". Shelter workers dreaded putting down the dogs, but Ms Chien and others saw this as a better end for the unwanted, ageing or difficult-to-adopt animals than leaving them at risk of disease in overcrowded shelters. Colleagues spoke about Ms Chien's exceptional dedication to her job ""They called her a butcherâ¦ We are frequently scolded. Some people say we'll go to hell. They say we love to kill and are cruel,"" said Kao Yu-jie, one of her co-workers. ""But people still abandon their dogs. You hear all kinds of reasons: their dog is too mean, or not mean enough, barks too much, or doesn't bark enough."" Taiwan has two main problems when it comes to animal welfare: the number of pets being abandoned and the number of strays allowed to reproduce. In reality, the situation has improved over the past decade thanks to increased public awareness and efforts by shelters and activists to discourage abandonment and encourage adoptions. But the number of animals put down remains high and shelters are still underfunded and understaffed. The work is difficult and hours long. In some shelters, half the animals are killed. In 2015 around 10,900 were put down. And about 8,600 shelter animals died last year from other causes, such as illness. In the CTI interview, Ms Chien described the process of putting a dog down. ""We first let it take a stroll and eat some snacks and talk to it. Then we take it into the 'humane room'. ""When you put it on the table, it's very scared and its whole body is shaking. But after we administer the drug, it leaves in three to five seconds. It no longer shakes. Actually, it's very sad."" No psychological counselling was provided for the staff. Psychological support in this and other fields is practically unheard of in Taiwan. The Taoyuan shelter actually had one of the lowest euthanasia rates and highest adoption rates of any shelter. But a letter Ms Chien left behind when she killed herself suggested her concern for the welfare of the animals had consumed her. Her colleagues attest to this, although experts remind us that many and complex factors lie behind any suicide. ""She put herself under a lot of pressure. She cared a lot about the animals and the pressure from the work affected her,"" said Ms Lai. In the letter, Ms Chien wrote: ""I hope my departure will let all of you know stray animals are also life. I hope the government knows the importance of controlling the source [of the problem]â¦ Please value life."" The irony of her exhortation to value life was not lost on observers and blame was quick to be handed out. Newspapers accused the government of ""murdering"" her, with many saying it failed to come up with effective ways to stamp out pet abandonment or prevent strays from reproducing. The number of strays being adopted in Taiwan has in fact increased in recent years Some accused ""higher-level bureaucrats"" of trying to convince the public that Ms Chien simply couldn't handle her work pressures. But other commentators said that while shelter workers were easy to target, all of society must take responsibility. Many believe the root of the problem is the insufficient enforcement of a neutering and spaying law. The chief of the animal protection section of the Council of Agriculture, Chiang Wen-chuan, said a law requiring spaying and neutering only recently came into effect, and doesn't allow staff to impose fines immediately. And even though staff pay visits to the owners of 60,000 animals each year to urge them to follow the laws, only 30% of the island's 1.7 million dogs have been spayed or neutered. ""We are very short-staffed. All of Taiwan only has 140 animal protection staff,"" said Mr Chiang. ""It's a systematic problem. Ending euthanasia and expanding shelters and staff will not solve the problem."" Some Taiwanese also believe such medical procedures change the personality of their pets. Others want to breed to give to friends or sell. Ms Chien already knew, when she died, that a new law was coming into force. From 4 February 2017, it will be illegal to put down abandoned animals. Budgets have also increased by 40%, there will be more inspectors and now anybody who wishes to abandon their pet at a shelter will have to pay a fee as high as $125 (Â£100). As well as increasing adoption, the public are being encouraged to microchip, as well as spay and neuter their animals The authorities say this is nothing to do with Ms Chien's suicide, and her story, which was simply a human tragedy. The government has pledged to increase funding and staffing at shelters and provide psychological counselling. But many see these as short-term measures. Activists want the government to crack down on breeders, implement subsidies for NGOs to spay and neuter, and provide assistance to groups that take in strays. Perhaps Ms Chien was not the catalyst for the changes, but her love for animals will not be forgotten by her husband, also an animal control worker, and her colleagues - all of whom were left pain-stricken by her death.

NewsbeatDrake offers refund after singer falls in hole,"Drake is promising to refund 20,000 fans after Travis Scott fell into a hole on stage at his gig at the O2 in London. The 24-year-old was joining the Canadian as a special guest on his Boy Meets World tour. He was performing Goosebumps when he tripped into the cavity in the middle of the stage, damaging part of the set. He disappeared for a few seconds before Drake helped him back out. This is the moment it happened,external Travis didn't seem hurt but apparently it meant a huge globe was broken and couldn't come out on stage. This Instagram picture shows how the globe should have looked... It was posted after an earlier gig,external Drake then told fans he was doing this ""for free tonight"" and he'd ""deal with it later"". ""You can pay for it later,"" he said. He repeated the offer at the end of the gig saying: ""London England, I love you, I hope you enjoyed your free show"". There's no word from his people yet though, so it's not clear if fans at the O2 arena will actually be getting a refund. He could definitely afford it though. Forbes magazine estimates he's worth Â£47m. Travis later tweeted the gig was fun and ""London is wild"". Earlier this month, Drake has postponed the opening UK dates of the tour.

TV star swaps Paradise for family time,"Kris Marshall said his family were unable to join him to film the current series Working for six months a year on a Caribbean island might sound like the dream job - but now Kris Marshall, the star of BBC One's Death in Paradise, has decided to leave the show. Marshall has played DI Humphrey Goodman on the detective drama, which is filmed on Guadeloupe, for four years. The actor, who made his name on sitcom My Family, said he wanted to spend more time with his wife and young children. A new detective will arrive in his place, played by Ardal O'Hanlon. O'Hanlon is best known for his roles in Father Ted and My Hero. Ardal O'Hanlon will arrive as DI Jack Mooney In a BBC press release, Kris Marshall said: ""Death in Paradise has been an incredible experience, six months every year filming on a tropical island in the sunshine - what's not to love! ""Humphrey was socially awkward and clumsy but also brilliant, I'll miss him but it's time to hand over to someone new and spend more time with my family. ""I know Ardal will do a superb job and I just hope Humphrey gets a happy ending!"" Marshall's character will be seen for the final time when the show's sixth series ends on Thursday 9 February. He has said this was the first series where his family didn't join him in Guadeloupe for the filming. He and wife Hannah have a four-year-old son Thomas and a younger daughter, Elsie. ""We did Skype about once a week,""he told The Sun,externalabout filming the current series. ""But my son got bored very quickly. It's like: 'Seeing your face is one thing, but if you can't play with me then you're no real use to me so I'm gonna go off and do something else.' ""You just end up coming off FaceTime feeling quite bereft and actually quite empty."" In 2015, before Elsie was born,he told Radio Times,external: ""I'm not sure I could do the show if my son and my wife weren't with me."" O'Hanlon will be seen as Marshall's replacement, playing DI Jack Mooney, on Thursday's episode (2 February), and will take over as the main detective on the sun-drenched, murder-afflicted fictional island of Saint Marie next year. O'Hanlon said: ""I am delighted to be joining Death in Paradise and exploring what's made Mooney up and leave London for a life in the Caribbean. I've already had a taste of filming in Guadeloupe and can't wait to get back."" An average of 8.7 million viewers watched the first three episodes of the current series. Marshall has been seen solving crimes on Saint Marie since the third series, when he took over from Ben Miller, who starred in the first two series.

"'Listen, don't judge'","The stigma around mental health problems can have a devastating impact on people's lives, a survey has found, often leaving behind a trail of break-ups, severed friendships and lost jobs. To get people talking and help break the stigma, charities have launched Time to Talk Day on Thursday. Here, eight people share their experiences. Diagnosis: Depression, anxiety and distress intolerance I've suffered since I was a young girl and always prided myself on how well I could hide my illness. I would lie to my school friends telling them I was on holiday when I was actually an in-patient. If I was not bubbly and sociable, my friends would say I was in ""death mode"". It made me feel very isolated. They're no longer my friends - just acquaintances. It has caused lasting damage and meant I always try to pretend I'm OK now. People need to understand that there's a spectrum of emotions - it's OK to feel happy, and it's OK to feel sad. Diagnosis: Borderline personality disorder At my worst, I was very erratic and hurtful. For my parents, it was like having an imposter in their home. My dad almost disowned me - he told me to snap out of it. Every time I had a bad day, he assumed I was suicidal or I was going to hurt someone. I think he was scared of the implications of having a child that would be ill for the rest of their life. It made me feel very unsupported, as though he did not accept me, so I moved out. It took three years to heal our relationship, and took for me to get worse and then better again for him to see that I could get better. I wish he had sat down with me and talked to me, rather than treat me like a burden. Diagnosis: Depression and anxiety My partner - and first love - was working in France. I had been struggling with the distance and my mind had started whirring with negative thoughts. She knew my history but thought it was in my past. A week before I was due to fly out to see her, she broke up with me over Skype. I blamed myself entirely for the split, and started thinking maybe I could never have a relationship. My family and friends are very supportive so it was hard not to get the support from someone I loved. I've tried to explain my anxiety to her in a letter and emails, but she hasn't replied. I'm very lucky to have a new partner now. She finds it really hard to fully understand my problems but she's read up on anxiety. It's about being there to listen - not judge. Diagnosis: Bipolar disorder I had a temper, I was uncontrollable but, for a long time, I just thought it was me. All my relationships in the past have broken down. It's been a nightmare. You get looked at in a different way from a ""normal"" person. Every argument is: ""Are you taking your medicine?"", ""You're a nutter."" It's very hard to explain what goes on in your mind. Some days can feel like your mind is a prison - you're trapped. My fiancee has experience of bipolar, and she's my rock. My advice to others in my position? Be open from the start. Some people won't be OK with it - you have to expect that. There's a lot of stigma in the world. Diagnosis: OCD previously, now depression and anxiety I chose not to tell my new employers about my mental health problems because I didn't want it to be a big deal. The job was stressful and I was signed off work. But when I returned and told them, no-one there knew what to do. At one point, my manager stopped talking to me, and an HR person said: ""If it's so awful here, why haven't you left?"" After six months, I was dismissed because my work was not up to standard, despite having told them I couldn't cope. But it was discrimination, and they got away with it. My new job has been a completely different experience. I told them, and even the senior bosses said their door was always open for a chat. It sounds silly but they've just been really nice about it. Diagnosis: Depression and anxiety When the illness was at its worst, I would come home from work very stressed out. I would find it difficult to talk about it and that would create a lot of tension. My wife and I would end up having arguments about trivial things, like what salad to have for dinner. It would happen in a flash and I would be in tears for several hours, and end up physically drained. For her, it was like being caught in a violent storm, and all she could do was take cover, and try to reassure me. It's so hard to live with someone who is mentally ill. The person you married has disappeared. She had got the worst of me. All they can do is continue to be there, and stay in it for the long haul. Diagnosis: Depression My wife and I divorced because of my mental health problems. After that, friends would assume I was down because of my divorce - and sometimes I was but it was also because of my mental health. I found it very hard to sit down and say all that to them. You would be exposing a part of yourself. When I opened up to one friend, she said: ""What have you got to be depressed about?"" I've told plenty of lies over the years to explain my absence - a stomach ache or my car's broken down. Recently I told a friend the truth - that I wasn't coming out because of my mental state. He texted back saying: ""Thanks for telling me. I'll be there when you need me. Man hugs."" Patience is good. Mood self-assessment: Could I be depressed? What is mental health? Diagnosis: Bipolar type two and borderline personality disorder I kept it a secret for a long time because I was afraid how my friends would react. At 18, I opened up. Some were supportive. Others seemed to want to blame me, saying it was my fault and if only I tried harder then I would be fine. I was really upset because it had taken me so long to build up the courage. It's as though they threw it back in my face, and I closed up again. It was three years before I opened up again - and this time it's been very different. Maturity and education make the difference. It's important to realise that everyone's mental health is different. If you want to help, you need to ask that individual how you can help. Don't be scared to approach the subject. We're not after a therapist, we're after a friend. And if you're the one opening up, expect people to be upset or shocked. They react like that because they care. Mental health charities are calling it Time to Talk Day on Thursday, in a bid to get people across England talking about mental health problems and help break the stigma. To coincide with a big conversation in schools, universities, councils, government departments and on social media, it has released findings from a survey of 2,000 adults with a range of mental health problems. The poll found almost two fifths (38%) had been treated negatively because of their problems. Of those: Nearly one in five (19%) lost their job Over half (54%) lost contact with a loved one And 55% stopped socialising or going out Sue Baker, director of organisers Time to Change, said: ""Progress is being made in improving attitudes and reducing discrimination in some key areas of life but too many of us are still being made to feel isolated, ashamed and worthless by other people's reactions. ""The good news is that being open about mental health, and ready to listen, can make a positive difference and potentially change lives.""

England pick Launchbury to face France,"Daly has played eight times for England and has scored one try Six Nations: England v France Venue:TwickenhamDate:Saturday, 4 FebruaryKick-off:16:50 GMT Coverage:Live on BBC Radio 5 live, text commentary and post-game video highlights online Elliot Daly has been named on the wing for England's Six Nations opener against France on Saturday, with the in-form Jack Nowell on the bench. Nowell missed two days of training this week for personal reasons. Maro Itoje will start a Test for the first time on the flank, and is named alongside Tom Wood and Nathan Hughes in the back row. Joe Launchbury and Courtney Lawes start in the second row, after George Kruis was ruled out with a knee injury. Hughes is at number eight in place of the injured Billy Vunipola while prop Joe Marler, who has recovered froma fractured leg,starts. Flanker James Haskell is among the replacements. Daly, who has also played at centre for England, wassent off on his last appearance for his countryagainst Argentina in December, having started the previous Autumn Internationals against South Africa and Fiji. ""Elliot did superbly for us in the autumn,"" said England coach Eddie Jones. ""He's got genuine pace and can play as a third centre. Jack's absence had nothing to do with selection."" Six questions for Eddie Jones to tackle Get rugby news as it happens by signing up for our new alerts BBC coverage of the 2017 Six Nations Matt Dawson scored 12 - can you beat him on our rugby quiz? There are eight changes from the starting line-up that sealedEngland's first clean sweep of the Six Nationsin 13 years when the teams met in Paris in March. Mako Vunipola (knee) and Chris Robshaw (shoulder) are unlikely to play a part in England's title defence, while winger Anthony Watson (hamstring) andsecond row Kruis (knee)have been sidelined for the tournament opener. Despite the disruption to his preparations, Jones wants his side to take risks. This video can not be played Six Nations tries of the tournament ""In rugby terms you've traditionally got two contrasting styles - French flair and England's dogged conservative approach, but we want to be absolutely daring against the French in this first game and set the standard for the tournament,"" he said. Wales make five changes for trip to Italy Strauss in for Scotland to play Ireland Henderson and O'Brien in Ireland team ""Guy Noves likes a big team. He picks a traditional French forward pack with squat front-rowers who scrummage well, big locks who give a lot of ballast and athletic back-rowers. ""It's based on size and crunching that gain line, getting an offload and then playing with flair. ""Of course, this gives you an opportunity when you've got a big forward pack against you and we intend to exploit that."" England's attacking threat was evident in the series whitewash of Australia in the summer and the autumn internationals, scoring 35 or more points in five of their past seven games. However, despite 13 straight victories since taking charge last year, Jones has toldhis team to be tighter in defence.,external 5 live rugby commentator Chris Jones Jack Nowell has been in outstanding form for his club Exeter this season, but after missing Tuesday's training session he has to make do with a place on the bench as the versatile Elliot Daly starts. Maro Itoje's selection on the flank is eye-catching, as is James Haskell's return to the squad after his long injury lay-off. And while George Kruis' injury is a blow, England are extremely well-stocked in the second row, with Joe Launchbury and Courtney Lawes a high-quality pairing. England team to face France:Mike Brown; Jonny May, Jonathan Joseph, Owen Farrell, Elliot Daly; George Ford, Ben Youngs; Joe Marler, Dylan Hartley (captain), Dan Cole; Joe Launchbury; Courtney Lawes; Maro Itoje, Tom Wood, Nathan Hughes. Replacements:Jamie George, Matt Mullan, Kyle Sinckler, Teimana Harrison, James Haskell, Danny Care, Ben Te'o, Jack Nowell. France start with six players beaten by Jones' side in Paris during March. The loss of Wesley Fofana to a torn achilles will see Gael Fickou switch roles, while there will be a focus on 22-year-old Baptiste Serin, playing his first Six Nations game at scrum-half. Serin has captained his country at under-20 level and impressed in his early outings for Les Bleus at senior level. Flanker Kevin Gourdon and loose-head prop Cyril Baille will also play in the competition for the first time as coach Guy Noves looks to improve on a fifth-placed finish last year in what is his second campaign in charge. France team to face England:Scott Spedding, Noa Nakaitaci, Remi Lamerat, Gael Fickou, Virimi Vakatawa, Camille Lopez, Baptiste Serin; Cyril Baille, Guilhem Guirado (captain), Uini Atonio, Sebastien Vahaamahina, Yoann Maestri, Damien Chouly, Kevin Gourdon, Louis Picamoles.

Pregnant Beyonce photo mesmerises America,"Less than two weeks into Donald Trump's presidency, it seemed the only news from here on out would be political. The new president and his flurry of executive orders and swift-moving, substantive changes to US policy and procedure seemed to leave little oxygen for any other headlines. But even President Trump lacks the star power of Queen Bee. Prior to the inauguration, some fans joked that Beyonce should drop an album as Trump was being sworn in, and in doing so steal the spotlight from the new commander in chief. Beyonce shares more pregnancy photos Beyonce's twins: The best reactions What's the message behind Beyonce's photo? Beyonce did one better: she announced,via a resplendent photo on Instagram, that she would be dropping something else - two something elses, in fact. That's right - Beyonce is having twins. And the news has been welcomed by more than eight million of her followers - making it Instagram's most-liked post of all time. ""I literally tripped and fell at a formal Fulbright dinner because I found out Beyonce was pregnant with twins,"" wrote one woman on Twitter. Other social media users were less articulate, relying on gifs and emojis to showcase their elation. The photo showed Beyonce kneeling in front of a giant hedge of roses, wearing blue satin knickers and a maroon bra. She is covered with a long green veil, and is already heavily pregnant. ""This pic is a powerful statement on bodies, maternity & the sacred. Beyonce continues to push us to reimagine womanhood. A feminist icon,"" gushed writer Laura Rankin. It's fitting that Beyonce used Instagram to relay her news. Twitter has become an all-out war zone between alt-right egg accounts and the professional left. Facebook is full of posts from friends and relatives begging people to call their Senators, sign a petition, or attend the next march. Instagram has remained a social media Switzerland: there, it's nothing but home-decorating photos, artfully staged food and cute babies - an apolitical oasis in these troubled times. Beyonce's news was powerful enough to bring some of the Insta-tranquility over to the rest of social media, and for a brief hour or so political Twitter was tempered with jokes about Beyonce's baby shower and several plays on ""Betwice"". Possible name suggestions included Yellow and Red Ivy - her five-year-old daughter with Jay Z is Blue Ivy Carter. It was almost like 2016 again. That's not to say her announcement was strictly apolitical. As one comedian on Twitter noted, ""there are more black people in Beyonce right now, than in Trump's entire cabinet team."" Some also saw a hint of politics in the timing: the news came on 1 February, the first day of Black History Month. ""BEYONCE WAITED UNTIL BLACK HISTORY MONTH BECAUSE SHE LOVES US SO"" wrote New York Magazine writer Rembert Brown, who is not usually given to all caps. It was a more fitting kick off for many than the address given by President Trump earlier in the day, in which he called Frederick Douglass, America's most significant abolitionist, ""someone who has done a terrific job that is being recognised by more and more people"".

Radcliffe 'yet to see' Potter play,"Radcliffe (right) appears with Joshua McGuire in the Old Vic production Harry Potter star Daniel Radcliffe has revealed he's yet to see the stage play of JK Rowling's eighth Potter story. ""I just feel it would not be a relaxing evening at the theatre,"" he said of Harry Potter and the Cursed Child. ""I assume every night there are 1,000 Harry Potter fans in the audience,"" he continued, adding it was ""fantastic"" they were there to see the play. Radcliffe is shortly to return to the London stage in an Old Vic revival of Rosencrantz and Guildenstern are Dead. The 27-year-old said he had read Sir Tom Stoppard's play ""at a fairly formative age"", having studied it while on the Harry Potter set, and could remember being ""baffled and delighted"". First staged in 1966, the play replays Shakespeare's Hamlet from the point of view of two hapless minor characters. Radcliffe plays Rosencrantz in the 50th anniversary production, while Joshua McGuire plays Guildenstern. Jamie Parker plays the adult Harry in the two-part Cursed Child stage play Speaking to the BBC's Rebecca Jones, Radcliffe said he had studied Shakespeare at school but had never performed it on stage. He said Sir Tom's play, which features the scenes from Hamlet in which Rosencrantz and Guildenstern appear, was ""an amazing introduction"" to the Bard of Avon's work. ""It's a play so full of ideas there's always going to be something new to play with,"" he went on, adding he was ""starting to enjoy the poetry"" of the Shakespeare sections. The actor also revealed he would ""probably just ignore"" fans who attempt to record his performance, recalling that people had tried to talk to him on stage when he made histheatre debut in Equus,external.

"Easy, peasy, freezy!"," Easy Is your freezer jam-packed full of mysterious foods from a time long-forgotten? Maybe your freezer is a stop on the way to the bin for all kinds of odds and ends you don't know what to do with.  With a few simple tricks, you can eliminate waste and save money on food. 1. Save your leftovers by flat-packing them in bags that stack easily. 2. Make using up leftovers easier by writing the expiry date on the bags, not the day you froze it. Most cooked foods keep for 3 months. You'll find it easier to grab something that needs using up quickly, without doing the math. 3. Save leftover stock, coconut milk, chilli, ginger in ice cube trays to make an instant soup, straight from the freezer. Just add straight-to-wok noodles, coriander and any other vegetables you fancy. 4. Flash-freeze loose items like sliced bananas, berries, sliced chillies or ginger if you want to use a little at a time. Place the food on a baking tray and freeze before transferring to a sealable freezer bag. Then you can use as much or as little as you need. 5. Know how long you should keep meat and fish to avoid the straight-to-bin syndrome: - Bacon: 1 month - Sausages: 2 months - Fish fillets: 3 months - Mince: 4 months - Chops, chicken pieces: 6 months - Roasts and whole chickens: 9-12 months"
Feeling itchy?," Helen shares what she learned from In Our Time. But rather than do this, I have decided to be measured and scientific, and convey objectively the destructive and (occasional) helpful things that parasites do to the human body. Despite our suits, fashionable trainers and expensive haircuts, we are really just ecosystems on legs. Writing, crawling, evolving masses of parasites. Put the detergent down and just accept it. Humans can host up to 400 species of parasite. Proportionally, from your left knee down to your big toe is your own cells and the rest of your body is other stuff, a lot of it parasitic. In fact, parasites make up half of the planet’s biomass. Kayla King tells Melvyn Bragg about types of parasites and how they move between hosts. Parasites have played a significant role in the course of evolution. Zebras are thought to be stripy because insects don’t want to land on that particular pattern, meaning that zebras are spared constant biting. Then there is the phenomenon of the zombie snails, which is too bizarre to omit. This occurs when snails ingest theLuco chloridiumparasite, which makes their antennae swell and strobe, and also causes the snails to stay in full view of their predators during the day instead of hiding away. This is so the parasite can make its way to its target host – birds. But when it comes to humans, our parasitic overlords have influenced us in a different way. Hosts and parasites co-evolve, and host survival chances are considerably higher if they are sexual rather than asexual beings. Sexual reproduction creates beings with novel gene combinations, making them less vulnerable to being wiped out by a parasite than asexual creatures. And females are inclined to pick males who are more resistant to parasites and who give out the message, “I’m fit, I’m resistant to infection.” This applies to humans as well as other animals, and as Steve Jones of UCL put it, “We owe our sex lives to our parasites.” Females become more picky and resist all but the best males. Well, some of us do at least. Anyone who has seen what some women will settle for on New Year's Eve will know that is not always true. Another fascinating and relatively common phenomenon is the effect that a cat parasite has on humans. At least one third of humans are infected with toxoplasma. It gets into our brains and studies suggest a strong link between psychological conditions such as schizophrenia and depression, and this parasite. Also, people killed by dangerous driving are twice as likely to have been infected by it than the general population. If you wanted to build bridges between humans across millennia, you could look at what kind of parasites people were carting about then. It’s fascinating that we’ve always been carrying this extra baggage around. The mummies of Ancient Egypt have preserved parasite eggs in them, and when scientists examined soil samples of the recently exhumed King Richard III, they found he had round worms. These worms were common at the time and were around 10 inches long. The reason this archaeology of parasites can exist is because they need to be pretty hardy. The worms that live in our guts lay eggs which leave the human body in our faeces. They go into the environment and, in order to survive until they find another host, they have hard shells. While the ones found with the Egyptian mummies or the last Plantagenet king are no longer active, some parasites can hang around for a good long while. The mysterious death of Lord Carnarvon has been attributed to an infection in King Tut’s tomb that lay in wait for thousands of years. Note to self: do not explore cursed tombs. Parasitism: download the extended programme However damaging they can be, they’re a part of the world and a part of us. Parasite-free mice that are grown in labs are very weak and tend to die quickly when compared with their parasite-full contemporaries. Parasites force nature to come up with new ways of resisting them, so without them nature would be less diverse. They’ve been part of what’s made our societies – all the way from monkeys grooming each other to ancient societies picking off skin-dwelling parasites to the de-lousing stations in Inuit dwellings. It’s thought that a lack of parasites today – with detergents and so on – means that we’re more prone to allergies. Parasites make up who we are, but I can’t help but feel it would be nicer if they didn’t."
Nigerian ex-governor challenges UK conviction,"James Ibori was released from a UK prison in December after serving four years of a 13-year sentence A Nigerian politician is appealing against his British conviction for corruption, claiming the Metropolitan Police investigation was itself mired in corruption. James Iboriwas released in Decemberafter four years in a British prison, but prosecutors have since admitted they have documents suggesting police officers involved in the case took bribes. The UK government spent years and millions getting Ibori out of Nigeria and into a British court in one of the most expensive and complex police investigations undertaken. Ministers wanted to prove their determination to tackle corruption in Africa. Ibori, a former London DIY store cashier, wasjailed for fraudtotalling nearly Â£50m in April 2012. But now the tables have been turned with Ibori claiming the British authorities were themselves corrupt. ""I have been unfairly treated, that's all I can say,"" Mr Ibori told the BBC, confirming that he plans to appeal against his conviction for money laundering. ""Yes, I am, of course. I have made that decision personally and I have instructed my solicitors."" Ibori was extradited from Nigeria to London in 2010 Ibori was believed to have laundered large sums in the UK, just part of hundreds of millions of dollars it was claimed he had embezzled from the Nigerian people. On a state salary of just Â£4,000 a year he had bought a fleet of luxury cars and expensive properties. He was also looking to buy a private jet. In 2005 the Department for International Development funded a special police unit inside Scotland Yard to go after corrupt African politicians. Its prime target was Ibori. Its aim: to get him into a British court and convict him for corruption. Having been extradited to London in 2010, Ibori was convicted and sentenced to 13 years for money laundering two years later. But since he was jailed, documents have emerged suggesting that at least one officer involved in the Ibori investigation had taken thousands of pounds in bribes. Last year, after repeatedly telling judges there was no evidence of police corruption, the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) admitted they had found substantial material that supported the allegations. Last summer, defence lawyers learned more about an undercover Scotland Yard investigation called Operation Limonium. ""There exists intelligence that supports the assertion that [a police officer] received payment in return for information in respect of the Ibori case,"" the CPS admitted. The officer in question has always denied taking bribes and internal police investigations have previously exonerated him. Details of how Scotland Yard tapped phones and conducted covert surveillance on a number of officers in the unit investigating Ibori emerged for the first time. Ibori bought expensive properties and cars, including this Bentley, on a salary of Â£4,000 a year Other documents alleging officers had taken bribes were sent to the authorities anonymously in 2011 by a lawyer convicted as part of the Ibori case. Former solicitor Bhadresh Gohil says he was trying to alert them to the police corruption. ""I brought this case to the attention of the Met police, the commissioner of the Met police Sir Bernard Hogan-Howe, I brought it to the attention of Alison Saunders, the head of the CPS. I also drew it to the attention of the then Home Secretary Theresa May,"" Mr Gohil says. ""Unfortunately, no-one did anything about this."" What they did do was attempt to prosecute Mr Gohil for perverting the course of justice by faking the documents. With the CPS release of the new documents, that case collapsed. The British authorities managed to get their man before a judge in 2012, but now James Ibori is willingly returning to the courts looking to put the reputation of the UK's criminal justice system on trial. The irony will not be lost on government ministers.

'You're not alone',"The stigma around mental health problems can have a devastating impact on people's lives, a survey has found, often leaving behind a trail of break-ups, severed friendships and lost jobs. To get people talking and help break the stigma, charities have launched Time to Talk Day on Thursday. Here, eight people share their experiences. Diagnosis: Depression, anxiety and distress intolerance I've suffered since I was a young girl and always prided myself on how well I could hide my illness. I would lie to my school friends telling them I was on holiday when I was actually an in-patient. If I was not bubbly and sociable, my friends would say I was in ""death mode"". It made me feel very isolated. They're no longer my friends - just acquaintances. It has caused lasting damage and meant I always try to pretend I'm OK now. People need to understand that there's a spectrum of emotions - it's OK to feel happy, and it's OK to feel sad. Diagnosis: Borderline personality disorder At my worst, I was very erratic and hurtful. For my parents, it was like having an imposter in their home. My dad almost disowned me - he told me to snap out of it. Every time I had a bad day, he assumed I was suicidal or I was going to hurt someone. I think he was scared of the implications of having a child that would be ill for the rest of their life. It made me feel very unsupported, as though he did not accept me, so I moved out. It took three years to heal our relationship, and took for me to get worse and then better again for him to see that I could get better. I wish he had sat down with me and talked to me, rather than treat me like a burden. Diagnosis: Depression and anxiety My partner - and first love - was working in France. I had been struggling with the distance and my mind had started whirring with negative thoughts. She knew my history but thought it was in my past. A week before I was due to fly out to see her, she broke up with me over Skype. I blamed myself entirely for the split, and started thinking maybe I could never have a relationship. My family and friends are very supportive so it was hard not to get the support from someone I loved. I've tried to explain my anxiety to her in a letter and emails, but she hasn't replied. I'm very lucky to have a new partner now. She finds it really hard to fully understand my problems but she's read up on anxiety. It's about being there to listen - not judge. Diagnosis: Bipolar disorder I had a temper, I was uncontrollable but, for a long time, I just thought it was me. All my relationships in the past have broken down. It's been a nightmare. You get looked at in a different way from a ""normal"" person. Every argument is: ""Are you taking your medicine?"", ""You're a nutter."" It's very hard to explain what goes on in your mind. Some days can feel like your mind is a prison - you're trapped. My fiancee has experience of bipolar, and she's my rock. My advice to others in my position? Be open from the start. Some people won't be OK with it - you have to expect that. There's a lot of stigma in the world. Diagnosis: OCD previously, now depression and anxiety I chose not to tell my new employers about my mental health problems because I didn't want it to be a big deal. The job was stressful and I was signed off work. But when I returned and told them, no-one there knew what to do. At one point, my manager stopped talking to me, and an HR person said: ""If it's so awful here, why haven't you left?"" After six months, I was dismissed because my work was not up to standard, despite having told them I couldn't cope. But it was discrimination, and they got away with it. My new job has been a completely different experience. I told them, and even the senior bosses said their door was always open for a chat. It sounds silly but they've just been really nice about it. Diagnosis: Depression and anxiety When the illness was at its worst, I would come home from work very stressed out. I would find it difficult to talk about it and that would create a lot of tension. My wife and I would end up having arguments about trivial things, like what salad to have for dinner. It would happen in a flash and I would be in tears for several hours, and end up physically drained. For her, it was like being caught in a violent storm, and all she could do was take cover, and try to reassure me. It's so hard to live with someone who is mentally ill. The person you married has disappeared. She had got the worst of me. All they can do is continue to be there, and stay in it for the long haul. Diagnosis: Depression My wife and I divorced because of my mental health problems. After that, friends would assume I was down because of my divorce - and sometimes I was but it was also because of my mental health. I found it very hard to sit down and say all that to them. You would be exposing a part of yourself. When I opened up to one friend, she said: ""What have you got to be depressed about?"" I've told plenty of lies over the years to explain my absence - a stomach ache or my car's broken down. Recently I told a friend the truth - that I wasn't coming out because of my mental state. He texted back saying: ""Thanks for telling me. I'll be there when you need me. Man hugs."" Patience is good. Mood self-assessment: Could I be depressed? What is mental health? Diagnosis: Bipolar type two and borderline personality disorder I kept it a secret for a long time because I was afraid how my friends would react. At 18, I opened up. Some were supportive. Others seemed to want to blame me, saying it was my fault and if only I tried harder then I would be fine. I was really upset because it had taken me so long to build up the courage. It's as though they threw it back in my face, and I closed up again. It was three years before I opened up again - and this time it's been very different. Maturity and education make the difference. It's important to realise that everyone's mental health is different. If you want to help, you need to ask that individual how you can help. Don't be scared to approach the subject. We're not after a therapist, we're after a friend. And if you're the one opening up, expect people to be upset or shocked. They react like that because they care. Mental health charities are calling it Time to Talk Day on Thursday, in a bid to get people across England talking about mental health problems and help break the stigma. To coincide with a big conversation in schools, universities, councils, government departments and on social media, it has released findings from a survey of 2,000 adults with a range of mental health problems. The poll found almost two fifths (38%) had been treated negatively because of their problems. Of those: Nearly one in five (19%) lost their job Over half (54%) lost contact with a loved one And 55% stopped socialising or going out Sue Baker, director of organisers Time to Change, said: ""Progress is being made in improving attitudes and reducing discrimination in some key areas of life but too many of us are still being made to feel isolated, ashamed and worthless by other people's reactions. ""The good news is that being open about mental health, and ready to listen, can make a positive difference and potentially change lives.""
