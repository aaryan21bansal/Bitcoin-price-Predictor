Police officer sacked for sex with teen,"Sgt Corey Alvey was based at Stamford Police Station A police officer who had sex with a ""vulnerable"" teenager has been dismissed. Special Sgt Corey Alvey, 26, was part of a team involved in a search for the 17-year old, referred to only as HF, who had been reported missing. A disciplinary hearing, at Lincolnshire police headquarters, was told Mr Alvey - based in Stamford - made legitimate contact with the teenager on Snapchat. But he had then continued to contact HF on Instagram after the search ended. More on this and other local stories from across Lincolnshire The officer had flirted with the vulnerable teenager on Instagram, the panel heard Matthew Green, for Lincolnshire Police, told the hearing in Nettleham the subsequent contact via Instagram was ""inappropriate, personal and unprofessional"". He said it was plain the officer ""believed he could facilitate a personal relationship with HF"". The panel heard the officer had initially appeared to be supporting and reassuring HF after the incident on 9 April, but the content of his messages had then become flirtatious. The following day Mr Alvey took HF, whose gender was not revealed at the hearing, to his home where they had sex, Mr Green told the panel. The matter was then reported to police by HF's father, he said. In conclusion, Mr Green told the hearing the officer knew, or should have known, HF was vulnerable. He added it was clear public trust in the police had been seriously damaged. Lincolnshire's Chief Constable Bill Skelly, who chaired the hearing, found the officer's actions amounted to gross misconduct and dismissed him without notice. He said Mr Alvey, who was not present at the hearing, had grossly undermined his privileged position. The hearing comes just a day after another Lincolnshire police officerwas dismissed. PC Rebecca Stevenson was found to be at twice the legal alcohol limit when she lost control of her vehicle and crashed into a dyke.

"Auschwitz Nazi, 96, unfit to stand trial","Hubert Zafke faced 3,681 counts of being an accessory to murder German prosecutors have said a case against a 96-year-old former SS medic should be thrown out because he is unfit to stand trial. Hubert Zafke is accused of assisting in the killing of 3,681 people at the Auschwitz-Birkenau concentration camp. Medical evaluations in March and July this year determined Mr Zafke, who has dementia, to be ""unfit to stand trial"". A court spokesman said ""the defendant is no longer able to reasonably assess his interests"". It is estimated that 1.1 million people, most of them European Jews, died at Auschwitz before it was liberated by Soviet forces in 1945. Mr Zafke's defence have said he suffers from poor health, high blood pressure and suicidal thoughts. His trial, which began in February 2016 in the north-eastern town of Neubrandenburg, has been postponed three times because of concerns regarding his health. Seventy years since Auschwitz liberated The Holocaust year by year Why did ordinary people commit atrocities in the Holocaust? Stefan Urbanek, a spokesman for the regional prosecutor's office, said, quoted by AFP: ""Now the dementia has reached a severity that the defendant is no longer able, inside and outside the courtroom, to reasonably assess his interests or coherently follow or give testimony."" He said that prosecutors were required by law to submit a motion to dismiss the case after receiving this independent medical evaluation. A lawyer for the two co-plaintiffs, who are sons of a woman murdered at Auschwitz, acknowledged the motion to end the trial ""complied with the rule of law"". The former SS medic served for several weeks in the summer of 1944 in the medical unit at the Auschwitz death camp in Nazi-occupied Poland. Hubert Zafke denies the charges, and argues that he treated only wounded soldiers and members of the SS. A Polish court sentenced him to a four-year jail term after the war, and he was released in 1951. But during his first questioning by German prosecutors in 2014, he denied ever having worked at Auschwitz. He later acknowledged his presence but said he was unaware of the gas chambers and crematoria at the death camp until after the war had ended. Teenage Jewish girl Anne Frank arrived at the camp during the period covered by Hubert Zafke's indictment. She died in another camp, Bergen-Belsen, shortly before it was liberated by the British Army in 1945. Hubert Zafke served in the medical unit at Auschwitz-Birkenau death camp Proceedings against Mr Zafke, a farmer's son who joined the SS when he was 19, were halted last October following complaints that the judges were biased. The International Auschwitz Committee, which represents Holocaust survivors, has previously attacked Germany's handling of the case, saying the court was hurtling ""between sloppy ignorance and complete disinterest"" in a resolution.

'Divorce bill' row frustrates Brexit talks,"This video can not be played Michel Barnier, EU's chief Brexit negotiator: UK's requests are ""simply impossible"" Both the UK and EU have expressed frustration at the pace of Brexit talks amid disagreement over the size of the UK's ""divorce bill"". EU negotiator Michel Barnier said the UK did not feel ""legally obliged to honour its obligations"" after Brexit. He said ""no decisive progress"" had been made on key issues, following the third round of talks. But Brexit Secretary David Davis said the UK had a ""duty to our taxpayers"" to ""rigorously"" examine the EU's demands. And he urged the EU to be ""more imaginative and flexible"" in its approach. During a joint press conference, Mr Barnier acknowledged there had been some ""fruitful"" discussions on the issues surrounding the relationship between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, but he struck a pessimistic tone overall. He stressed that he was ""impatientâ¦ I am not angryâ¦ I am impatient and determined"" about the progress of negotiations, adding that ""time is flying"" and the EU was willing to intensify the ""rhythm"" of talks. Behind their polished podium performances, it's clear there are major gaps between the stance of Michel Barnier and David Davis which are not being bridged. Money is the big sticking point of course, although the phraseology around the issue is a little more elegant than that, and the language at these moments can give you a real feel for the underlying atmosphere. Mr Barnier says that after this week ""it's clear that the UK doesn't feel legally obliged to honour its obligations"". Mr Davis claims it's natural that the UK would want to ""interrogate rigorously"" any demand placed on its taxpayers. But he is also careful to note that Britain is a country that meets its obligations - moral as well as legal; it just expects them to be properly specified. Read more This video can not be played David Davis, Brexit secretary: ""I think it's fair to say we've seen some concrete progress"" The UK wants to begin trade talks as soon as possible, but Brussels insists that discussions about the future relationship after Brexit can only begin once ""sufficient progress"" has been made on the arrangements for withdrawal - including on the so-called ""divorce fee"". Mr Barnier said that at the current rate of progress, he was quite far from being able to recommend opening parallel talks on a future trade relationship with the UK. Reality check: Why it's all about money Brexit: All you need to know 'Fruitful' talks on Irish issues At-a-glance guide to Brexit negotiations Brexit: What is at stake in EU-UK talks? He cited two areas where ""trust"" needed to be built between the two sides - on citizens' rights and the financial settlement, stressing that 27 members of the bloc should not have to pay for obligations taken by 28. Claiming there had been a shift in the UK government's approach, he said: ""In July the UK recognised that it has obligations beyond the Brexit date but this week the UK explained that these obligations will be limited to the last payment to the EU project before departure."" No figure has yet been put on the payment, but European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has suggested it could come in at around 60 billion euro (Â£55bn), while unconfirmed reports have put it as high as 100 billion euro (Â£92bn). Mr Davis defended the ""rigorous"" line-by-line examination of the EU's demands carried out by British officials in response to the ""unspecified but undoubtedly large"" sum demanded by Brussels. He added: ""It will, of course, lead to difficult exchanges - nobody will pretend it was anything but a tough exchange this week - but I think the British taxpayer would expect nothing less."" Former Labour PM Tony Blair was also in Brussels for talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker Mr Davis also told reporters the talks had exposed how the UK approach was ""substantially more flexible and pragmatic than that of the EU"". ""This week we have had long and detailed discussions across multiple areas and I think it's fair to say we have seen some concrete progress, and Michel referred to one but there's more than that,"" he said. ""However, as I said at the start of the week, it's only through flexibility and imagination that we will achieve a deal that works truly for both sides. ""In some areas we have found this from the [European] Commission's side, which I welcome, but there remains some way to go."" He added: ""Beyond the debates about process and technicalities, at the heart of this process, must be a desire to deliver the best outcome for the people and the businesses of the European Union and the United Kingdom,"" he added - particularly on citizens' rights.

US tells Russia to close consulate,"The closure of the San Francisco consulate leaves just three remaining in the US, a senior administration official says Russia has been ordered to close its San Francisco consulate and two trade missions in response to ""unwarranted"" Russian action, the US has said. The consulate, and annexes in New York and Washington, must close by Saturday. The US state department's move follows Moscow's reduction of US diplomatic staff in Russia last month. That in turn followed new US sanctions on Russia over Crimea and alleged election interference, which led to the expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats. President Barack Obama had ordered those expulsions, along with the closure of two compounds, last December. Although Russian President Vladimir Putin did not respond initially to that move, with Mr Trump set to assume office, he thenannounced on 31 Julya reduction of 755 US diplomatic staff in Russia, in retaliation for the US sanctions. The US embassy in Moscow. US staff in Russia have been sizeably reduced The US diplomats expelled have until this Friday to leave Russia - a day before the US closures of the Russian consulate and two annexes, which are trade missions, must be completed. A senior administration official said on Thursday that the consulate and the residence attached to it as well as the two trade missions would close but no Russian staff would be required to leave the country. Should we worry about US-Russia diplomatic spat? Russia: The 'cloud' over the White House Reality Check: What are the sanctions against Russia? Russia will be allowed to maintain the properties, but not use them, the official added. The state department said the US actions were ""in the spirit of parity"". It blamed Moscow for what it called a downward spiral in bilateral ties, but suggested it wanted an end to the current spat. ""The United States hopes that, having moved toward the Russian Federation's desire for parity, we can avoid further retaliatory actions by both sides and move forward to achieve the stated goal of both our presidents: improved relations between our two countries and increased co-operation on areas of mutual concern,"" state department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement. The move leaves each country with three consulates in place, Ms Nauert added. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov spoke to US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson in a phone call on Thursday, expressing ""regret at the escalation of tensions in bilateral relations"". He said Moscow would study the order and respond accordingly, according to a statement from the Russian foreign ministry. Mr Lavrov and Mr Tillerson are due to meet in September on the sidelines of the UN General Assembly in New York. Earlier this month, Mr Trump said US relations with Russiawere at a ""dangerous low""amid a row with Congress over the fresh sanctions against Moscow. The Trump-Russia saga in 200 words Why are so many US diplomats in Russia? The president, who wanted warmer ties with Russia, had opposed the bill, which included a provision that limits his ability to lift sanctions and forces him to consult Congress first. Mr Trump has been dogged by claims that Russia tried to sway the election in his favour and several investigations are under way to determine whether anyone from his campaign colluded with Moscow. But the Kremlin has repeatedly denied interfering and Mr Trump has insisted that there was no collusion, calling the investigations a ""witch hunt"". What are the sanctions on Russia?

Cafe owner defends 'no kids' policy,"Bob Higginson said with many antiques on display he was ""quite nervous"" about small children being in the coffee shop The owner of a cafe with a no children under 12 policy has hit back at critics calling for a boycott of his shop. The Chart Room, in Brixham, Devon is an ocean-liner themed coffee lounge which also houses antiques and collectables. Bob Higginson said it was designed for people to experience the ""opulence and splendour of early steamship travel without distraction"". But resident Wendy Moore said she would be boycotting the cafe, and calling on others to do so. More on this story and other Devon and Cornwall news ""Can anyone tell me just what kind of town we're living in when dogs are allowed into an establishment and children are not?"" she wrote. ""Who on earth does this Bob Higginson think he is? Would he ban disabled people from entering his premises? Or people of a particular race or colour or religion? I'll bet my bottom dollar he wouldn't; he'd be frightened to death to do so."" The Chart Room is an ocean-liner themed coffee shop But Mr Higginson says the policy has been ""blown out of proportion"". ""I simply wanted to create a nice quiet zone where grown-ups could sit, relax and enjoy the quiet atmosphere,"" he said. ""There are plenty of other places for people with children to go. ""It's not like I've launched a ballistic missile over Torbay."" Mr Higginson said he has received ""a hundred messages of support"" since the ""unfounded accusations"" were posted online.

School exam rules review after cheat row,"School Standards Minister Nick Gibb says he wants a review of the rules surrounding teachers who help to write exam questions in England - in the wake of claims of cheating. ""The public must have confidence in the integrity of the exam system, and cheating of any kind is unacceptable,"" said Mr Gibb. The Ofqual exam watchdog will carry out the review and report later this year. This will find whether checks are ""sufficiently robust"", says Ofqual. The review follows claims of advance information being leaked about exams. There have been calls for a clearer separation between teachers involved in setting questions and those teaching the subject. Eton College's deputy head of academics left following allegations that he had shared confidential information about a forthcoming economics exam with other members of staff. Winchester College has suspended its head of art history, after allegations of ""advance knowledge"" of exam papers. The exams were the Cambridge International Pre-U, usually taken by private school pupils as an alternative to A-levels. ""Exam regulator Ofqual is now reviewing the rules under which teachers take part in writing and reviewing question papers, and have confirmed to me that they are considering whether action is needed,"" said Mr Gibb. ""The overwhelming majority of teachers act appropriately when working with exam materials, but where they do not schools have a responsibility to report it to the exam board for investigation."" A statement from Ofqual says: ""The involvement of serving teachers in the process of exam setting has many benefits and exam malpractice by teachers is rare. ""However, access to live materials must be appropriately controlled and risks to security minimised. We will investigate whether the safeguards in place are sufficiently robust and whether changes are needed."" Earlier this week, Malcolm Trobe of the ASCL head teachers' union suggested that senior examiners could be barred from preparing pupils for exams set by the board for which they work. It has been seen as important for practising teachers, with specialist subject knowledge and current classroom experience, to advise on setting exam questions. But there have been concerns about a conflict of interest if teachers are working with exam boards and at the same time preparing pupils for exams set by the same board. Chris King, chair of the Headmasters' and Headmistresses' Conference (HMC) group of independent schools, said: ""Pupils, parents and schools deserve an examination system which is open, transparent and supported by the best teachers. ""While exam malpractice is very rare, it has no place in any school as demonstrated by the decisive action taken by HMC heads involved in recent instances. ""We therefore welcome this review of exam safeguards and hope it will reassure teachers they need not be put off becoming involved in exam paper design.""

Bin strikes could resume on Friday,"Rubbish piled up on the streets of Alum Rock in Birmingham during the dispute Birmingham bin workers are expected to resume strike action after the city's council said it was issuing redundancy notices. The seven-week strike action that saw mountains of waste pile up on streets was suspended on 16 August amid talks between Unite and the city council. But the council reneged on a deal that saw the strike suspended and said a meeting due on Friday would not happen. The Unite union described the move as a ""deeply provocative act"". It said refuse workers were expected to resume industrial action and could walk out for three hours on a daily basis at 07:00, 10:30 and 13:00 BST. The union warned industrial action ""could extend until the new year"". Refuse workers started strike action on 30 June Conciliation service Acas said on 16 August the council had accepted the workers' case and restored the jobs of grade three workers, who are responsible for safety at the back of refuse vehicles. But a council report said the deal struck by Unite and the councilwas unaffordable.

Reality Check: Why it's all about money,"All smiles from the Brexit negotiators despite major differences between the two sides The biggest fights in the European Union are always about money, so there was never any reason to suppose that the Brexit negotiations would be any different. Last year, Treasury figures show the UK paid about Â£13bn to the EU, around Â£200 per person. Some of which then gets spent in the UK. But the European Commission is trying to calculate what the UK's outstanding financial obligation should be when it leaves. The EU argues that the UK has made a series of big financial commitments as part of the current seven-year budget that need to be paid on exit. It also says the UK needs to settle its share of what's known as the ""reste Ã  liquider"". This is money that has been committed but not yet paid - in effect the EU's credit card bill. No decisive progress on Brexit - Barnier What is at stake in EU-UK talks? All you need to know about Brexit Here's the problem for the EU: the less the UK agrees to pay, the more other countries will have to fill the gap. That means that countries that are net contributors to the EU budget, like Germany or the Netherlands, will have to pay more. At the other end of the scale, the countries that are net beneficiaries, like Poland or Greece, will receive less. So when the UK argues that the EU is being unreasonable in its demands, it has no allies at all. The hard line approach adopted by the European Commission has come from pressure from other member states. They don't think, for example, that the UK should be entitled to a share of the EU's assets when financial calculations are made. Source: European Commission British officials spent several hours during this week's negotiations questioning the legal basis of the EU's proposals. But they haven't put forward counter-proposals of their own - which, in turn, is annoying European officials. How can we negotiate, they argue, when we don't know what you want? Hence the pessimistic tone of Europe's chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier, who again insisted that the divorce deal must be agreed before talks move on to discuss issues such as the future trade relationship. Mr Barnier claimed there had been ""no decisive progress"" and the negotiations were still ""quite far"" away from being able to move on to other issues. The EU hasn't publicly put a figure on the amount it thinks the UK should pay, but many estimates come up with a net figure of about 60 billion euros. The UK says it won't pay anything like that. One possible route out of the impasse is talk of a transition period. If the UK was still paying into the EU budget for two or three years after Brexit, that could help reduce the final exit bill considerably. It would also fill a hole in the EU budget, and generate goodwill elsewhere on the continent. Mujtaba Rahman is a Brexit expert and Managing Director at the Eurasia Group, a political risk consultancy. He says that it will be up to Theresa May to lay the groundwork in order for negotiations to progress: ""In October when heads of state get together there will be an opportunity for Theresa May to make the case that she can only write a cheque if it's packaged as part of a bigger deal that gives the UK concessions on both transition and future trade terms."" It is worth remembering that compared to what's at stake in renegotiating the UK's entire trading relationship with the EU and the rest of the world, even 60 billion euros or more isn't a huge amount. But politically, it's explosive. And three months after these negotiations finally began, under pressure of time, it has become the toughest nut to crack. In the end it will have to be resolved by political decisions rather than legal or technical advice.

Where is the cheapest travel money?,"A long time ago obtaining foreign currency for your holiday was a hassle. Before government controls on foreign exchange were removed in 1979, you could only obtain holiday cash by going to your bank or a bureau de change. There were limits on how much money you could take out of the country. If you did not want to carry too much cash, you could buy travellers cheques which you then cashed at a bank abroad. Things are rather different these days. There are no limits on taking your own cash out of the country, though there may be restrictions at your destination. And for sums larger than 10,000 euros,a UK customs declaration must be made,externalif you take the money to or from a non-EU country. But that is deter crime such as money laundering rather than to spoil a big family holiday. The world is your oyster. You can still go to your bank or to the Post Office and order foreign cash from them. But selling foreign currency is a lucrative business and many other companies would like you as their customer. For instance, bureaux de change are seemingly everywhere - in the High Street, supermarkets and department stores, as well as the traditional locations of airports, ports and railway stations. But choosing one need not involve traipsing around your local streets. Stay at your computer or use your smartphone and Google will tell you which ones are closest to you. There are some comparison websites to help you chose between them, such asmytravelmone,externaly,compareholidaymoney,external,travel-money,external, andmoneysavingexpert.com,external. Note that the rates on offer on bureau de change websites are for people who order online in advance, and then collect from the bureau. They may well deliver the money to your home as well, though a fee may be involved. You will, however, receive a poorer rate if you just turn up unannounced, needing some cash there and then. You can always use your credit card or debit card abroad, either to take cash out of a foreign ATM or to pay in a shop or restaurant, but it can be fearfully expensive. You will you be charged at your bank or credit card provider's unattractive exchange rate. Also, you may also have to pay a variety of hefty fees as well: for spending in a foreign currency, for taking cash out of an ATM abroad, or for simply using it to pay for something. The website Moneysaving expert has thisvery useful guide,externalwhich is updated weekly. One of its most useful points is that there are several credit cards which go out of their way to attract travellers by not loading huge fees on the use of their cards. Its current top recommendations for credit cards to be used abroad, without these fees, are the Halifax Clarity and the Barclaycard Platinum Travel cards. These have become very popular in the past decade or so and there is quite a wide choice from providers such as FairFX, ICE, Moneycorp and Caxton. You have to open an account to obtain the card. Then you can simply load it via the company's website in the currency of your choice. It can then be used to take cash of a foreign ATM or to buy things abroad. The two big advantages are that the foreign exchange rate at which you load your card will be a bit better than the one you will be offered by, for instance, a High Street bank. And there are likely to be no charges at the point of use. But note that some cards do levy fees. One particularly popular card has been the Post Office Travel Money Card which, like some others, does charge an ATM fee. In this case,the Post Office charges,externalÂ£1.50 for sterling withdrawals, two euros for euro withdrawals, and $2.50 for withdrawals in dollars. Generally speaking, the worst exchange rates are to be found at airport bureaux de change outlets - unless you order in advance. Operating expenses are high and the customers are a captive market It certainly used to be the case that pre-paid cards offered the best rates, but that no longer seems to be the case. For instance, at the time of writing, most pre-pay card providers seem to be offering 1.06 euros to the pound, but that is the same as the many online bureaux de change. Meanwhile High Street banks such as NatWest and Barclays are currently offering euros online at the slightly less generous rates of 1.03 to the pound.

Why does Houston suffer so many floods?,"Houston is now the flood capital of the United States Parts of the Houston region have been hammered by more than 50in of rainfall since Hurricane Harvey made landfall, setting new records for the US. But why has the city become America's flood capital? In April 2016""historic"" flooding hit Houston, with 17.6in (44.7cm) of rain dumped on the city in a single day. The flood came only 11 months afteranother massive stormstruck the city, dropping over a foot of rain. Together, these two events caused 16 deaths and more than $1bn (Â£777m) in damages. Both pale in comparison to Hurricane Harvey, the impact of which has secured Houston's unenviable reputation as theUS city most severely affected by floods,external. Understanding why the risk to life and property is rising is crucial not only to the future of America's fourth-largest city, but to others around the world which share many of its problems. Houston's unbridled, rapid growth is a primary factor. The population of its metropolitan area is close to 6.8 million people and, with predictions of some of the country's fastest growth for the coming years, it is expected to top 10 million by 2040. Growth itself is not a problem, as it can create economic, social and environmental benefits for cities. But poorly planned growth which fails to carefully manage land use - for housing, businesses and the infrastructure like roads, parks and sewers that cities need - can create problems and even lead to disasters. Houston has long favoured light touch controls, which has led to haphazard development. The city now covers an enormous area of more than 1,500 sq km. It is the archetype of urban sprawl, where land is made readily accessible for real estate development on the city's ever expanding periphery. Why was Houston not evacuated? Hurricane Harvey: The climate link 'Everything is gone' This unplanned growth has led to many problems. One is that vast acres of wetlands and prairie land - which soak up large amounts of rainfall - have been paved over. Between 1992 and 2010, for example, White Oak Bayou in north-west Houstonlost about 70% of its original wetlands,external. During heavy rain the city's growing expanses of concrete generate runoff that clogs and sometimes overwhelms its complex network of waterways. This includes creeks and bayous, as well as flood controls like levees and detention basins. Successful wetland and prairie land protection would not itself have a major effect in reducing flooding caused by unprecedented rainfall like that delivered by Harvey. Yet, protecting and restoring the natural areas provides an important contribution to making Houston less vulnerable to more moderate storms. They also bring environmental benefits - providing fish and wildlife habitats, and cleaning polluted runoff that can sometimes enter from the city. The artificially blue-coloured areas show water detected before and after the storm. Another problem is that investment in flood control infrastructure - things like channels, dams and reservoirs - has failed to keep pace with the expansion of the city. Houston is a car-oriented city, with multi-billion dollar projects supporting one of the most advanced systems of roads and highways in the world. Houston is a city built for cars The goal is to keep traffic moving. The mismatch between spending on flood prevention and roads can bring new challenges, as fresh tarmac is laid for motorists. One example is the partially completed State Highway 99. Once completed this 290km (180-mile) loop will be the longest in the nation - encircling the Houston area. Further urban sprawl on the edges of the city will inevitably follow and without careful planning, large new tracts of impervious concrete will be laid. The runoff generated can cause problems for residents when heavy rains arrive. For example, since the 1980s, rainfall has increased 26% in the Brays Bayou watershed, butrunoff has increased by 204%,external. Another study suggests that an additional3,500 households in the Sims Bayou watershed,externalin the south of the city were exposed to flooding as a result of increased runoff. The tragedy wrought by Hurricane Harvey offers an opportunity to plan for the rebuilding of a more resilient city. The expansion of the city has led to short-term financial rewards for developers and builders, while local government has benefitted from an expanded tax base. But they have not shared the risk presented by flooding - the costs of which are mostly passed on to residents and the national government. More than 3,000 people have been rescued in Houston alone To survive on the Texas Gulf Coast in the coming century, the city and its surrounding region will have to make careful planning decisions to guide growth. Better co-ordination between federal, state and local government bodies is sorely needed. The city will also have to consider how it defends itself against storms. Making huge investments in flood control infrastructure will be necessary if they are to keep pace with the rapid expansion of the population. What is it like to be in Houston? In maps: Houston and Texas flooding Is there too much focus on Harvey? While Harvey offers a dramatic example, devastating storms are becoming more frequent and severe around the world. Rapid and poorly planned urbanisation, rising sea levels, and subsidence put the world's coastal cities at increased risk of flooding. One World Bank study forecasts that global flood damage for large coastal cities could cost $1 trillion a year by 2050 unless action is taken. There are cities that offer a hint of what can be achieved - both in the US and elsewhere. Faced with more coastal storms and rising sea levels on the Atlantic Coast, Norfolk, Virginia, has adopted long-term strategies for guiding future land use and development. For example, areas at low risk of flooding where there has so far been limited development will be transformed into high density and mixed income neighbourhoods. In contrast, high risk areas with established neighbourhoods are to gradually retreat from shorelines, with housing buyouts, while key sewer and water utilities, and roads will be maintained rather than expanded. Rotterdam's Maeslant surge barrier is part of the city's extensive flood prevention system Rotterdam, in the Netherlands, provides another model. Ninety percent of the densely populated city lies below sea level. Its pioneering solutions to flooding entail living with the water, rather than trying to contain it. It has installed underground garages, green roofs that absorb water and water plazas that serve as a kind of aquatic town square, while simultaneously acting as huge storage reservoirs when extreme rainfall occurs. From the Norfolk and Rotterdam perspectives, flooding and climate change are not obstacles to economic development, but opportunities.

Turning the dead into vinyl records,"There is about a teaspoonful of Madge Hobson's ashes in her record John Hobson is listening to a recording of conversations with his late mother, mostly small talk about family. The words are on a vinyl record, although this is more than a recording of memories. The ashes of Madge Hobson are combined with the vinyl, with a photograph and details of her life printed on the labels. ""It makes the perfect family record, which can be passed down the generations,"" says Jason Leach, 46, the founder of And Vinyly, which produced the disc. The firm is part of a fast-growing sector of the end-of-life industry. No longer need ashes be stored in an urn or scattered to the wind. Now you can wear, drink from, or display a little part of what is left of your loved one. Mr Hobson, a 69-year-old sculptor, says his mother, a devout churchgoer, would thoroughly approve of her record. ""I had to weigh out a quantity of the ashes [which had been kept in an urn], and put a large teaspoonful into a number of small plastic bags, one for each disc,"" he says. Fifteen records were pressed for family and friends. Says Mr Hobson: ""I think And Vinyly has undoubtedly helped to keep the memory of my mother alive."" Jason Leach says he wants to increase production to meet increasing demand Mr Leach, based in Scarborough, North Yorkshire, began pondering the possibilities of pressing ashes into records about 10 years ago. There was no business plan. He was just reflecting on mortality, issues brought into sharper focus when his mother began work at a funeral directors. ""I was amazed by how little I or any of my friends had even properly considered or even accepted our own mortality, and how incredibly sheltered many of us are from death and conversations around it,"" Mr Leach says. ""It was not intended to be a business. It was the result of having a bit of fun with what at the time felt like a shocking and disconcerting inevitability."" The process is the same as making a standard vinyl disc, with ashes (human or pet) added at a specific stage in production. ""It's a balance between adding enough ashes so as to be seen, but not so much as to affect the grooves' smooth playing,"" says Mr Leach. ""There will, of course, be some extra pops and crackles resulting from the inclusion of ashes - but we like these, as this is you."" Prices vary as every request is different, he says. A basic package costs about Â£900, rising to about Â£3,000. Options include 7-inch or 12-inch discs, specially-composed music, a portrait painted on the record using the ashes, and clear or coloured vinyl. This could be you - an Algordanza diamond is made from human ashes Mr Leach, a music producer and music label owner, currently presses about two discs a month that have human ashes added to them, on equipment he already owns. But he is in the process of arranging more funding to meet rising demand. He is also linking with funeral homes which will offer the service. ""The concept markets itself,"" he says. ""Of course, there are those who find it strange, even creepy, but most people actually come round to the idea."" And his plans for his own record? Spoken words from him, his partner of more than 25 years, and their two daughters, plus some music he has written. ""I like to think about my great, great grandchildren listening to me. This is about as close to time travel as I'm going to get,"" he says. Algordanza's diamond-making machines produce more than 1,000 stones a year In Domat/Ems, Switzerland, Rinaldo Willy, 37, has another way of keeping memories alive - turning ashes into diamonds. ""I was diagnosed with cancer at the age of 21, and therefore was sensitised to the topic of death,"" he says. While a business studies student, in 2003, he read about isolating carbon from ashes to create synthetic diamonds. A year later, with his professor, he founded Algordanza. A diamond is 99.9% carbon, while the human body is 20%. After cremation about 1-5% of carbon remains. Natural diamonds - symbols of love and the everlasting - are created under enormous pressure and high temperatures inside of the earth. Algordanza replicates the process in its laboratory, creating stones within weeks. About 85 diamonds a month are made, costing between about Â£2,800 and Â£12,700.

The businesses capitalising on 24-hour sunlight Do you have to avoid huggers at work? The start-up investment in Algordanza was Â£300,000, with Mr Willy using all his savings. ""After six years, we were able to pay ourselves a proper salary,"" he says. The business now employs 60 people worldwide, with 12 based at the Switzerland headquarters. Many of Algordanza's customers have gone through huge trauma.

In Santa Fe, in the US, Justin Crowe, 29, uses cremated ashes as raw material for pottery. A fine art graduate, he founded Chronicle Cremation Designs in 2016. He already ran a ceramics studio, so needed minimal initial investment. But he has now raised $100,000 (Â£78,400) seed funding to expand. At Chronicle Cremation, Justin Crowe will turn ashes into home decor and small jewellery pieces A typical ceramic glaze is made up of flint, minerals and clay. ""We've developed a special glaze recipe that incorporates the cremated remains, which ultimately function to form the gloss you see on the surface of the work,"" Mr Crowe says. His Lifeware product line includes vases, urns, and coffee cups. The most popular items are candle luminaries and jewellery. Prices range from $195 for a necklace up to $995 for a large bowl. The ashes are used to help glaze the cups He gets plenty of unusual requests, such as from a women who wanted the ashes of her sister and two dogs glazed on to coffee mugs. Mr Crowe acknowledges that some people feel that transforming someone into a piece of homeware is disrespectful. But, he says, a flower vase or candle holder provide daily reminders of loved ones. ""Ultimately, the pieces are about keeping memories close in daily life.""

Â£100m drive to recruit foreign GPs,"The NHS in England is to pay recruitment agencies Â£100m as part of a huge international drive to boost the number of GPs. Contracts have been put out to tender that could see half of the extra 5,000 GPs promised by 2020 brought in from abroad. It comes as the NHS continues to struggle to train and retain its home-grown GPs. Support staff, including nurses and therapists, will also be targeted. NHS bosses said the move was needed to relieve the pressure on the service. The international recruitment is part of a Â£2.4bn investment in GP services by 2020. The boost in funding - a rise of 14% once inflation is taken into account - was announced after the 2015 election, during which the Conservatives made increasing the GP workforce a key priority. It was always envisaged that some of the extra 5,000 doctors would come from abroad, but thecontracts,externalbeing offered could lead to 3,000 of them coming from outside the UK. Â£2.4bn funding boost for GP services GP workload harming care - BMA poll NHS bosses are also in the process of increasing the number of training places for GPs - but last year 7% of spots went unfilled. The agencies bidding for them will be expected to cover the costs of relocation, recruitment and any extra training that is needed. The aim is to start recruiting in the autumn with EU doctors being targeted first. Dr Arvind Madan from NHS England, said: ""The NHS has a proud history of ethically employing international medical professionals, with one in five GPs currently coming form overseas. ""This scheme will deliver new recruits to help improve services for patients and reduce some of the pressure on hard-working GPs across the country."" Royal College of GPs chair Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard said the NHS was ""incredibly grateful for the skills and expertise"" of GPs from overseas. But she said: ""We welcome any GP from the EU or further afield who wants to work in general practice - as long as they meet the rigorous standards set by the College, General Medical Council and others to ensure safe clinical practice."" Dr Krishna Kasaraneni of the British Medical Association, predicted that even with the recruitment of doctors from abroad, the government would still fall ""well short of its target of recruiting 5,000 new GPs by 2020"".

No decisive progress on Brexit - Barnier,"This video can not be played Michel Barnier, EU's chief Brexit negotiator: UK's requests are ""simply impossible"" Both the UK and EU have expressed frustration at the pace of Brexit talks amid disagreement over the size of the UK's ""divorce bill"". EU negotiator Michel Barnier said the UK did not feel ""legally obliged to honour its obligations"" after Brexit. He said ""no decisive progress"" had been made on key issues, following the third round of talks. But Brexit Secretary David Davis said the UK had a ""duty to our taxpayers"" to ""rigorously"" examine the EU's demands. And he urged the EU to be ""more imaginative and flexible"" in its approach. During a joint press conference, Mr Barnier acknowledged there had been some ""fruitful"" discussions on the issues surrounding the relationship between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, but he struck a pessimistic tone overall. He stressed that he was ""impatientâ¦ I am not angryâ¦ I am impatient and determined"" about the progress of negotiations, adding that ""time is flying"" and the EU was willing to intensify the ""rhythm"" of talks. Behind their polished podium performances, it's clear there are major gaps between the stance of Michel Barnier and David Davis which are not being bridged. Money is the big sticking point of course, although the phraseology around the issue is a little more elegant than that, and the language at these moments can give you a real feel for the underlying atmosphere. Mr Barnier says that after this week ""it's clear that the UK doesn't feel legally obliged to honour its obligations"". Mr Davis claims it's natural that the UK would want to ""interrogate rigorously"" any demand placed on its taxpayers. But he is also careful to note that Britain is a country that meets its obligations - moral as well as legal; it just expects them to be properly specified. Read more This video can not be played David Davis, Brexit secretary: ""I think it's fair to say we've seen some concrete progress"" The UK wants to begin trade talks as soon as possible, but Brussels insists that discussions about the future relationship after Brexit can only begin once ""sufficient progress"" has been made on the arrangements for withdrawal - including on the so-called ""divorce fee"". Mr Barnier said that at the current rate of progress, he was quite far from being able to recommend opening parallel talks on a future trade relationship with the UK. Reality check: Why it's all about money Brexit: All you need to know 'Fruitful' talks on Irish issues At-a-glance guide to Brexit negotiations Brexit: What is at stake in EU-UK talks? He cited two areas where ""trust"" needed to be built between the two sides - on citizens' rights and the financial settlement, stressing that 27 members of the bloc should not have to pay for obligations taken by 28. Claiming there had been a shift in the UK government's approach, he said: ""In July the UK recognised that it has obligations beyond the Brexit date but this week the UK explained that these obligations will be limited to the last payment to the EU project before departure."" No figure has yet been put on the payment, but European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has suggested it could come in at around 60 billion euro (Â£55bn), while unconfirmed reports have put it as high as 100 billion euro (Â£92bn). Mr Davis defended the ""rigorous"" line-by-line examination of the EU's demands carried out by British officials in response to the ""unspecified but undoubtedly large"" sum demanded by Brussels. He added: ""It will, of course, lead to difficult exchanges - nobody will pretend it was anything but a tough exchange this week - but I think the British taxpayer would expect nothing less."" Former Labour PM Tony Blair was also in Brussels for talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker Mr Davis also told reporters the talks had exposed how the UK approach was ""substantially more flexible and pragmatic than that of the EU"". ""This week we have had long and detailed discussions across multiple areas and I think it's fair to say we have seen some concrete progress, and Michel referred to one but there's more than that,"" he said. ""However, as I said at the start of the week, it's only through flexibility and imagination that we will achieve a deal that works truly for both sides. ""In some areas we have found this from the [European] Commission's side, which I welcome, but there remains some way to go."" He added: ""Beyond the debates about process and technicalities, at the heart of this process, must be a desire to deliver the best outcome for the people and the businesses of the European Union and the United Kingdom,"" he added - particularly on citizens' rights.

Man admits giving drugs to teen who died,"Leah Kerry died in Torbay Hospital after apparently suffering from an adverse reaction to a substance she had taken A man has admitted supplying drugs to a 15-year-old girl who died after a party at a park. Jacob Khanlarian, 20, from Newton Abbot, pleaded guilty at Exeter Crown Court to supplying ecstasy to Leah Kerry and two of her friends. Leah, from Salisbury, was found unconscious at Bakers Park in Newton Abbot, in the early hours of 15 July. The case was adjourned for toxicology reports to establish whether the drugs he supplied caused Leah's death. Police initially believed Leah may have diedfrom an adverse reaction to a ""legal high"". Khanlarian, of Elm Road, admitted four counts of supplying the class A drug MDMA, also known as ecstasy, and one of possessing cannabis with intent to supply. Three of the counts related to the supply of ecstasy to Leah and two other teenage girls at Bakers Park on the night she died. He also admitted supplying ecstasy to others between 1 January, 2015 and 15 July, 2017 and cannabis between 1 January, 2013 and 15 July, 2017. Leah and her family had moved from Torquay in Devon to Salisbury, in early 2015. She died in Torbay Hospital on 16 July. Khanlarian handed himself into police after the teenager's death and told them he had supplied a substance he believed to be MDMA, to a group of girls in the park. Following Leah's deathher family described heras ""a courageous and confident young woman"" who knew the dangers of drugs, but ""thought she was invincible"". The case was adjourned until 21 September.

'I would prefer to die than see my traditions die out',"Himba women apply red-coloured ochre on their skin as a daily beautification ritual Having survivedgenocide by German troops,externalin the 1900s, Namibia's Himba people are now facing a bigger threat to their way of life - encroaching modernity. Little has changed in Omuhoro village for generations - people live off the land and are closed off from the rest of the world. At day break, it is milking time - one of the daily duties of the village's women. The days are long but everyone has a role to play. The older women walk for kilometres to collect firewood and water, while another group focuses on cooking enough food to feed the 30 or so mouths in this homestead. The boys mainly look after the cattle and goats while the young girls help with taking care of the many children running around - there is a great sense of shared responsibility. But since Namibia's independence in the early 1990s, a different lifestyle has begun to filter through. A steady stream of young men and women has been opting to leave the slow village life in exchange for a fast-paced modern world. Now some are worried this move will eventually spell the death of Himba culture. Namibia's Himba people have lived a subsistence life for many years Owen Kataparo, a Himba man who grew up in Omuhoro, has taken me back to the Kunene region, an arid and rural area in north-east Namibia to show me how his community is changing. We are welcomed by village head Chief Nongaba. He has four wives and 19 children - he is a small man but exudes authority. Three of his children attend school - some villagers think this is a bad idea. They say they've seen how school changes their children. Mr Kataparo agrees. ""When these children get into school, most of the children feel shame. They think most of the children are talking about them, that they are not looking so beautiful,"" he tells me. The Himba are known for their red matted braids, which are painstakingly made by mixing animal fat, ash and ground ochre, a stone found locally. A few steps from where we are sitting, a group of women are bonding. They are smearing their bodies with the same ochre mixture. Their mahogany skin glistens under the Namibian sun. They tell me this is their beautification ritual, and one of their distinguishing features. It strikes me that Mr Kataparo is in western clothing - khaki shorts and a blue check shirt. The irony is not lost on him - now a successful businessman, Mr Kataparo says he feels he needs to assimilate to fit in. ""When I'm in traditional clothes outside the village, I get strange looks. I have a few businesses and people treat me with more respect when I look like them, they take me more seriously,"" he says. Himba people can attract unwarranted attention outside their villages The young men in this village see him as a sign of success - a poster boy of what's possible. He is torn by this influence, he says. ""A lot of boys leave the village and go down into the town to try to find a job,"" he says. ""Some of the boys find a job, some of the boys don't find a job, and then some of them decide to take alcohol. They end up abusing their life."" For those taking the leap, the closest town is Opuwo, an hour's drive away and the capital of this region. It's nothing to marvel at but its restaurants, supermarkets and bars offer the first taste of a completely different life. One of the most popular hangouts for the Himba living in Opuwo is the Arsenal Bar owned by a Himba man, Seblon Nghiphangelwa, a friend of Mr Kataparo.  It is one of 15 in the region and they all belong to him. Here they come to shed the responsibilities that come with traditional living, in this world it is everyone for themselves. The Arsenal Bar is a popular spot for many Himba people in Opuwo ""Most of my customers are Himba, they come here every day,"" Mr Nghiphangelwa tells me. ""Sometimes I feel ashamed when I see members of the Himba community getting drunk here. But I also feel ashamed to see them in Western clothing,"" he adds. Back in Omuhoro, Chief Nongaba says this dilemma is inevitable. As head of the village, you'd expect him to be fighting to hold on to the past but instead he is preparing his children for a life outside the village walls - by sending them to school. Chief Nongaba wants his children to be able to cope with the modern world But Chief Nongaba, who has never set foot inside a classroom, says it is his duty to prepare his children for a life outside the village. ""I want them to become doctors, teachers, work in government. I want them to live a different life to me, I want them to look like you,"" he tells me. ""Why?"" I ask and without hesitation, he responds: ""The world has changed."" But one of his wives, Mama Moharerwa, a tall figure with a booming voice, tells me their people belong in the village. ""The best life for us is in the village - it's how we've lived for many years, it's what we know. In the city we cannot survive."" People like Mr Kataparo are caught between the allure of modern life and a desire to save his traditional culture, ""It scares me a lot. I would prefer to die before the traditions of my people finish."" Read more from Pumza on Africa's disappearing cultures: 'Only three people speak my language' Has voodoo been misjudged?

Harvey shuts key US fuel pipeline,"US petrol prices have risen after a key network of pipelines was shut in the wake of Hurricane Harvey, sparking fears of a squeeze on fuel supplies to major US cities. The hurricane has already forced the closure of nearly a quarter of US oil refining capacity. Colonial Pipeline said it was closing its pipelines,externaldelivering diesel, petrol and aviation fuel along the East Coast. It later said the line east of Lake Charles, Louisiana, remained open. However, Colonial says ""deliveries will be intermittent and dependent on terminal and refinery supply"". It said it would be able to return to service from Houston on Sunday. European traders are scrambling to provide additional supplies. At least 33 people have been killed in eastern Texas since the storm hit. TheUS National Weather Service,externalhas now downgraded it to a tropical depression. But consequences of the storm are still being felt in Texas, withreports on Thursdayof black smoke issuing from a damaged chemical plant. There are fears that chemicals there could combust, causing explosions. Heavy rainfall is expected from Louisiana to Kentucky over the next three days, and flood warnings remain in effect for south-east Texas and parts of south-west Louisiana. US fuel prices have risen by more than 10 cents a gallon compared with a week ago, to nearly $2.45 on average nationwide, according to the American Automobile Association, amid reports that some East Coast refineries were running out of petrol. The threat of a fuel supply crunch has grown as key infrastructure is paralysed by the storm - Colonial's announcement indicates the knock-on effects are growing. The firm's network of pipelines is the country's largest supply system, taking refined fuel from the Gulf of Mexico to consumers in major US cities including New York, Atlanta and Washington DC. Colonial hadissued a statement,externalon Wednesday announcing its diesel and aviation fuel pipeline was closing immediately and that its petrol (gasoline) pipeline would be closed from Thursday because of outages at pumping points and a lack of supply from refiners. Of the 26 refineries that connect to the Colonial system, 13 are located between Houston and Lake Charles, it said. Why is Houston so vulnerable to floods? US accepts Mexico flood aid offer Shell faces Storm Harvey disruption Colonial, which in normal times supplies more than three million barrels of fuel a day, was the second major pipeline network to announce it was closing. The Explorer Pipeline, which has a much smaller capacity of 660,000 barrels a day, also said on Wednesday it was shutting down its supply line which runs from Houston to Tulsa, Oklahoma. Helicopters are being used to rescue people trapped by the floodwaters Parts of Texas have been hit by more than 50in of rainfall since Hurricane Harvey landed on 25 August, setting new records before it was downgraded to a tropical storm and, late on Wednesday, to a tropical depression. Large areas of Houston, the fourth most populous city in the US, remain under water. Why was Houston not evacuated? Hurricane Harvey: The climate link Rescue efforts continued overnight. Thousands of people have been rescued from the floodwaters, and more than 32,000 people are being housed in emergency shelters. Firefighters are due to begin a door-to-door search of badly flooded areas of Houston on Thursday, to rescue survivors who are still stranded and recover the bodies of those who have died. This video can not be played Storm Harvey: Three factors that came together to bring unprecedented rainfall At a news conference on Wednesday, Texas Governor Greg Abbott said the state could need more than $125bn (Â£97bn) from the federal government to help it recover. Mr Abbott has accepted an offer of aid from the Mexican government, which has suggested it is willing to despatch troops with food, water and medicine - as it did in 2005 when New Orleans was devastated by Hurricane Katrina. US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said it was ""very generous of Mexico to offer their help at this very, very challenging time for our citizens down in Texas"". The move comes amid tension between the two countries over President Donald Trump's repeated promises to build a vast border wall on the southern US border to keep out illegal immigrants and criminals, and to make Mexico pay for it.

How Houston became the flood capital of the US,"Houston is now the flood capital of the United States Parts of the Houston region have been hammered by more than 50in of rainfall since Hurricane Harvey made landfall, setting new records for the US. But why has the city become America's flood capital? In April 2016""historic"" flooding hit Houston, with 17.6in (44.7cm) of rain dumped on the city in a single day. The flood came only 11 months afteranother massive stormstruck the city, dropping over a foot of rain. Together, these two events caused 16 deaths and more than $1bn (Â£777m) in damages. Both pale in comparison to Hurricane Harvey, the impact of which has secured Houston's unenviable reputation as theUS city most severely affected by floods,external. Understanding why the risk to life and property is rising is crucial not only to the future of America's fourth-largest city, but to others around the world which share many of its problems. Houston's unbridled, rapid growth is a primary factor. The population of its metropolitan area is close to 6.8 million people and, with predictions of some of the country's fastest growth for the coming years, it is expected to top 10 million by 2040. Growth itself is not a problem, as it can create economic, social and environmental benefits for cities. But poorly planned growth which fails to carefully manage land use - for housing, businesses and the infrastructure like roads, parks and sewers that cities need - can create problems and even lead to disasters. Houston has long favoured light touch controls, which has led to haphazard development. The city now covers an enormous area of more than 1,500 sq km. It is the archetype of urban sprawl, where land is made readily accessible for real estate development on the city's ever expanding periphery. Why was Houston not evacuated? Hurricane Harvey: The climate link 'Everything is gone' This unplanned growth has led to many problems. One is that vast acres of wetlands and prairie land - which soak up large amounts of rainfall - have been paved over. Between 1992 and 2010, for example, White Oak Bayou in north-west Houstonlost about 70% of its original wetlands,external. During heavy rain the city's growing expanses of concrete generate runoff that clogs and sometimes overwhelms its complex network of waterways. This includes creeks and bayous, as well as flood controls like levees and detention basins. Successful wetland and prairie land protection would not itself have a major effect in reducing flooding caused by unprecedented rainfall like that delivered by Harvey. Yet, protecting and restoring the natural areas provides an important contribution to making Houston less vulnerable to more moderate storms. They also bring environmental benefits - providing fish and wildlife habitats, and cleaning polluted runoff that can sometimes enter from the city. The artificially blue-coloured areas show water detected before and after the storm. Another problem is that investment in flood control infrastructure - things like channels, dams and reservoirs - has failed to keep pace with the expansion of the city. Houston is a car-oriented city, with multi-billion dollar projects supporting one of the most advanced systems of roads and highways in the world. Houston is a city built for cars The goal is to keep traffic moving. The mismatch between spending on flood prevention and roads can bring new challenges, as fresh tarmac is laid for motorists. One example is the partially completed State Highway 99. Once completed this 290km (180-mile) loop will be the longest in the nation - encircling the Houston area. Further urban sprawl on the edges of the city will inevitably follow and without careful planning, large new tracts of impervious concrete will be laid. The runoff generated can cause problems for residents when heavy rains arrive. For example, since the 1980s, rainfall has increased 26% in the Brays Bayou watershed, butrunoff has increased by 204%,external. Another study suggests that an additional3,500 households in the Sims Bayou watershed,externalin the south of the city were exposed to flooding as a result of increased runoff. The tragedy wrought by Hurricane Harvey offers an opportunity to plan for the rebuilding of a more resilient city. The expansion of the city has led to short-term financial rewards for developers and builders, while local government has benefitted from an expanded tax base. But they have not shared the risk presented by flooding - the costs of which are mostly passed on to residents and the national government. More than 3,000 people have been rescued in Houston alone To survive on the Texas Gulf Coast in the coming century, the city and its surrounding region will have to make careful planning decisions to guide growth. Better co-ordination between federal, state and local government bodies is sorely needed. The city will also have to consider how it defends itself against storms. Making huge investments in flood control infrastructure will be necessary if they are to keep pace with the rapid expansion of the population. What is it like to be in Houston? In maps: Houston and Texas flooding Is there too much focus on Harvey? While Harvey offers a dramatic example, devastating storms are becoming more frequent and severe around the world. Rapid and poorly planned urbanisation, rising sea levels, and subsidence put the world's coastal cities at increased risk of flooding. One World Bank study forecasts that global flood damage for large coastal cities could cost $1 trillion a year by 2050 unless action is taken. There are cities that offer a hint of what can be achieved - both in the US and elsewhere. Faced with more coastal storms and rising sea levels on the Atlantic Coast, Norfolk, Virginia, has adopted long-term strategies for guiding future land use and development. For example, areas at low risk of flooding where there has so far been limited development will be transformed into high density and mixed income neighbourhoods. In contrast, high risk areas with established neighbourhoods are to gradually retreat from shorelines, with housing buyouts, while key sewer and water utilities, and roads will be maintained rather than expanded. Rotterdam's Maeslant surge barrier is part of the city's extensive flood prevention system Rotterdam, in the Netherlands, provides another model. Ninety percent of the densely populated city lies below sea level. Its pioneering solutions to flooding entail living with the water, rather than trying to contain it. It has installed underground garages, green roofs that absorb water and water plazas that serve as a kind of aquatic town square, while simultaneously acting as huge storage reservoirs when extreme rainfall occurs.

Doctor in court over 118 sex offences,"Manish Shah appeared at Barkingside Magistrates' Court A doctor has appeared in court charged with 118 sexual offences. Manish Shah, 47, of Brunel Close, Romford, is accused of sexually assaulting 54 people at a medical practice in Havering, east London, between June 2004 and July 2013. He is charged with 65 counts of assault by penetration, 52 counts of sexual assault, and one count of sexual assault on a child under 13. Dr Shah was granted conditional bail at Barkingside Magistrates' Court. He is due to appear at Snaresbrook Crown Court on 27 September. As part of his bail conditions Dr Shah is not allowed to attend his former surgery in Havering, or contact any current or former patients or staff. He was also barred from practising as a doctor and from accessing any NHS medical records. An investigation was launched into the doctor after several people went to police in July and August 2013. Dr Shah, a family planning specialist, trained at St Bartholomew's Hospital in London, qualifying in 1993. He was until recently listed as working in a limited capacity at a GP surgery in Southend-on-Sea, Essex. None of the alleged offences relate to his time at the Southend practice.

Why is Houston so vulnerable to floods?,"Houston is now the flood capital of the United States Parts of the Houston region have been hammered by more than 50in of rainfall since Hurricane Harvey made landfall, setting new records for the US. But why has the city become America's flood capital? In April 2016""historic"" flooding hit Houston, with 17.6in (44.7cm) of rain dumped on the city in a single day. The flood came only 11 months afteranother massive stormstruck the city, dropping over a foot of rain. Together, these two events caused 16 deaths and more than $1bn (Â£777m) in damages. Both pale in comparison to Hurricane Harvey, the impact of which has secured Houston's unenviable reputation as theUS city most severely affected by floods,external. Understanding why the risk to life and property is rising is crucial not only to the future of America's fourth-largest city, but to others around the world which share many of its problems. Houston's unbridled, rapid growth is a primary factor. The population of its metropolitan area is close to 6.8 million people and, with predictions of some of the country's fastest growth for the coming years, it is expected to top 10 million by 2040. Growth itself is not a problem, as it can create economic, social and environmental benefits for cities. But poorly planned growth which fails to carefully manage land use - for housing, businesses and the infrastructure like roads, parks and sewers that cities need - can create problems and even lead to disasters. Houston has long favoured light touch controls, which has led to haphazard development. The city now covers an enormous area of more than 1,500 sq km. It is the archetype of urban sprawl, where land is made readily accessible for real estate development on the city's ever expanding periphery. Why was Houston not evacuated? Hurricane Harvey: The climate link 'Everything is gone' This unplanned growth has led to many problems. One is that vast acres of wetlands and prairie land - which soak up large amounts of rainfall - have been paved over. Between 1992 and 2010, for example, White Oak Bayou in north-west Houstonlost about 70% of its original wetlands,external. During heavy rain the city's growing expanses of concrete generate runoff that clogs and sometimes overwhelms its complex network of waterways. This includes creeks and bayous, as well as flood controls like levees and detention basins. Successful wetland and prairie land protection would not itself have a major effect in reducing flooding caused by unprecedented rainfall like that delivered by Harvey. Yet, protecting and restoring the natural areas provides an important contribution to making Houston less vulnerable to more moderate storms. They also bring environmental benefits - providing fish and wildlife habitats, and cleaning polluted runoff that can sometimes enter from the city. The artificially blue-coloured areas show water detected before and after the storm. Another problem is that investment in flood control infrastructure - things like channels, dams and reservoirs - has failed to keep pace with the expansion of the city. Houston is a car-oriented city, with multi-billion dollar projects supporting one of the most advanced systems of roads and highways in the world. Houston is a city built for cars The goal is to keep traffic moving. The mismatch between spending on flood prevention and roads can bring new challenges, as fresh tarmac is laid for motorists. One example is the partially completed State Highway 99. Once completed this 290km (180-mile) loop will be the longest in the nation - encircling the Houston area. Further urban sprawl on the edges of the city will inevitably follow and without careful planning, large new tracts of impervious concrete will be laid. The runoff generated can cause problems for residents when heavy rains arrive. For example, since the 1980s, rainfall has increased 26% in the Brays Bayou watershed, butrunoff has increased by 204%,external. Another study suggests that an additional3,500 households in the Sims Bayou watershed,externalin the south of the city were exposed to flooding as a result of increased runoff. The tragedy wrought by Hurricane Harvey offers an opportunity to plan for the rebuilding of a more resilient city. The expansion of the city has led to short-term financial rewards for developers and builders, while local government has benefitted from an expanded tax base. But they have not shared the risk presented by flooding - the costs of which are mostly passed on to residents and the national government. More than 3,000 people have been rescued in Houston alone To survive on the Texas Gulf Coast in the coming century, the city and its surrounding region will have to make careful planning decisions to guide growth. Better co-ordination between federal, state and local government bodies is sorely needed. The city will also have to consider how it defends itself against storms. Making huge investments in flood control infrastructure will be necessary if they are to keep pace with the rapid expansion of the population. What is it like to be in Houston? In maps: Houston and Texas flooding Is there too much focus on Harvey? While Harvey offers a dramatic example, devastating storms are becoming more frequent and severe around the world. Rapid and poorly planned urbanisation, rising sea levels, and subsidence put the world's coastal cities at increased risk of flooding. One World Bank study forecasts that global flood damage for large coastal cities could cost $1 trillion a year by 2050 unless action is taken.

Betting firm 888 hit with record penalty,"Online gambling firm 888 is to pay a record penalty of Â£7.8m after it failed to protect vulnerable customers. TheGambling Commission said,externalthere were ""significant flaws"" in the firm's social responsibility processes. The regulator highlighted a technical failure which meant 7,000 customers who had chosen to bar themselves from their 888 accounts were still able to gamble. Another customer bet more than Â£1.3m over 13 months before he was identified as having a problem. 888 said it had been working co-operatively with the regulator throughout the review, resulting in the voluntary settlement, adding it was ""committed to providing players with a responsible as well as enjoyable gaming experience"". Sarah Harrison, chief executive at the Gambling Commission, said the penalty would ensure that ""lessons are learnt"". Part of the penalty package will be used to repay Â£3.5m in deposits made by the customers who had self-excluded themselves when they wanted to stop gambling. A technical flaw meant that they were still able to gamble on 888's bingo platform. ""Our requirements are that every company must provide the facility for every customer to be able to bar themselves from gambling. These 7,000 looked to do that. But 888 didn't deliver it as effectively as they should have done,"" Ms Harrison told the BBC. The regulator also pointed to one individual case in which a customer staked more than Â£1.3m, including Â£55,000 stolen from their employer. The customer in question gambled for three to four hours a day, over 13 months, placing a large number of bets. The Gambling Commission said ""the lack of interaction with the customer, given the frequency, duration and sums of money involved in the gambling, raised serious concerns about 888's safeguarding of customers at-risk of gambling harm"". Part of the penalty package - Â£62,000 - will be returned to the employer from whom money was taken. Another Â£4.25m will be paid to a socially responsible cause to invest in measures to tackle gambling-related harm. ""There are around two million people now in Britain who either are problem gamblers or are at risk of problem gambling,"" Ms Harrison said. ""Companies are beginning to put different practices in place to identify people right up front, but more needs to be done. We need to go further and we need to go faster."" How do we know there are ""two million people in Britain who are either problem gamblers or are at risk of problem gambling""? The figure comes from aGambling Commission report in 2015,externalbased on 15,000 responses to a survey in Great Britain. They use the Problem Gambling Severity Index (PGSI) to identify people at risk of gambling problems. They found: 2.8% of people were at low risk = 1,430,000 people 1.1% at moderate risk = 555,000 people The PGSI asks nine questions with four possible answers to give you a score, from ""never"" (0) to ""almost always"" (3). You only need to score one point to qualify as ""low risk"" which means you could say you ""sometimes"" ""felt guilty about the way you gamble or what happens when you gamble"" to be counted. When calculating the number of ""problem gamblers"" the report gives a range from 300,000 to 430,000 people. Even taking the lower figure in this range, combining the ""at risk"" and the ""problem"" gamblers gives us 2,285,000. The chief executive of rival betting company Ladbrokes Coral told the BBC that the whole sector was in the process of learning how best to manage the problem of vulnerable gamblers. ""We have a responsibility to look after our customers. Ladbrokes Coral are also on that journey and there are issues that we've found in the past. But we are working with the Gambling Commission,"" said Jim Mullen. ""So there's no pushback from Ladbrokes Coral on making sure we can provide a safer environment for gamblers"". Ladbrokes Coral published half yearly results on Thursday which showed a 7% rise in profits. The company saw a fall in bets placed in shops but a 17% rise in online revenues. The firm has been trying to strengthen its online gambling offering as the UK government considers introducing tougher rules for fixed odds betting terminals, which would have a further impact on its High Street retail operations.

How has Princess Diana's death changed the Royal Family?,"Diana, Princess of Wales was one of the most photographed women in the world The death of Princess Diana in 1997, and the public's response to it, shook the House of Windsor. Twenty years on, there's been a coup at the palace. It was bloodless. All the royals remain standing. But the power has shifted. The departure, earlier this month, of the Queen's dedicated senior official Sir Christopher Geidt has meant her eldest son can exert more control over the monarchy's direction of travel. The comings and goings of courtiers excite those on the inside and leave outsiders cold. However, recent changes should cheer Prince Charles. The heir who's waited and waited is more content and less anguished. He's still driven by a desire to deliver change but the royal prophet in the wilderness on climate change has been embraced by the mainstream. A prince once derided for talking to plants is praised for trying to save the planet. Prince Charles and Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall represented the Queen during Canada's 150th anniversary celebrations With each year that passes, his mother will do less and he will do more. There are fewer clouds on his horizon. It's a horizon that was once obscured by the War of the Waleses: his televised admission of adultery, and his leaked comments about tampons. And yet, and yet. Whatever accommodation he reached with his first wife in life hasn't survived her death. Diana haunts Charles. A recent YouGov poll commissioned by the Press Association suggested that the number of people who believe the Prince of Wales has made a positive contribution to the Royal Family has fallen over the past four years, down from 60% to 36%. This polling took place at a time when it was hard to escape references to Charles's painful past. Newspapers and television channels have reflected at length on the influence of Diana, Princess of Wales, an influence that stretched from fashion to the British monarchy. Photographs and floral tributes have been left outside the gates of Kensington Palace ahead of the anniversary of Diana's death It's been a month of coverage that must have perplexed anyone under the age of 25 and would have confused a visiting Martian. Charles's many supporters will argue that Diana's adverse impact on his popularity will recede with each passing year. But 20 years on, her influence still registers. The Queen was the first to feel it, in the days before the funeral in 1997. The status quo of an empty flagpole at Buckingham Palace and continued residence at her Scottish bolthole of Balmoral couldn't be maintained. The Queen was criticised for her silence in the days after Diana's death, and for the empty flagpole at Buckingham Palace The monarch returned early to London.  ""She relented,"" was how one of her former officials put it in a BBC documentary. ""I was surprised."" The Queen promised in a live televised address to the nation to learn lessons from Diana. The abiding one for the ancient institution has been to try to avoid ending up on the wrong side of public opinion. The week after the princess's death was the worst of the Queen's reign. She doesn't want a second such week. The Queen and Queen Mother at Diana's funeral at Westminster Abbey The princess's supporters would maintain that such self-preservatory moves have also been accompanied by a desire for Diana's memory to fade and not dominate the agenda. No royal attended the opening in 2000 of a garden in her memory. For two decades it was accepted that a woman who'd died aged 36 couldn't be captured in stone. Now her sons are acting. A Diana statue will be erected. The princes who grieved in private as boys are, as adults, trying to shape how she is remembered. Princes William and Harry, pictured at their mother's funeral, were 15 and 12 when Diana died William and Harry have talked in interviews about Diana's qualities as a mother and as a campaigner for causes she cherished, causes they have chosen to embrace. Those seeking signs of Diana's ongoing influence and relevance seize upon how comfortable her sons appear to be in their own skins, and in front of the public. It's not without cost. The two princes who live in a palace and who ate burgers outside with their mum have struggled to accept they can't lead a ""normal life"". Early on, the Queen embraced the fact that her private life had to be lived within the confines of her vast estates. Her grandsons still occasionally kick out against such constraints. As well as a desire to experience life on the outside, Diana's sons share her ambivalence towards the media. For the princess, the press was something she courted and tried to tame. She failed. For the princes, one fact will never fade. Photographers pursued their mother into a Parisian underpass as a drunken chauffeur transported her to an early grave. At the moment, Diana's influence on the monarchy appears to remain strong. It may well have abated by the time we enter the reign of King Charles, whose wife could yet be crowned Queen Camilla. The 30th anniversary of her death might not register as intensely as this year's milestone has done. For now though, she continues to be mourned both by those close to her, and those who never met her: the princess, who - in the words her brother Earl Spencer used in his eulogy - was ""the unique, the complex, the extraordinary and irreplaceable Diana"".

"In pictures: Diana, Princess of Wales","On the 20th anniversary of her death, here is a look back at Princess Diana's life as seen through the camera lens. Diana Frances Spencer was born on 1 July 1961 at Park House near Sandringham, Norfolk. She was the youngest daughter of the then Viscount and Viscountess Althorp. After her parents' divorce, she often had to travel between their homes in Northamptonshire and Scotland. After school, she worked in London, first as a nanny, occasionally a cook, and then as an assistant at the Young England Kindergarten in Knightsbridge. Rumours spread that her friendship with the Prince of Wales was blossoming into something more serious. Press and television surrounded her at every turn and her days at work were numbered. The Palace tried in vain to play down the speculation. On 24 February 1981 the engagement became official. The ring cost almost Â£30,000 and contained a sapphire surrounded by 14 diamonds. Lady Diana walked down the aisle with her father, Earl Spencer, at St Paul's Cathedral on 29 July 1981. Her dress, designed by David and Elizabeth Emanuel, had a 25ft (10m) train and was made of ivory taffeta and antique lace. Diana was just 20. Under the watchful eyes of her mother and on the arm of her father, Diana prepared to take her wedding vows. She showed nerves only once, when she struggled to recall her husband's names in the right order. Millions of television viewers around the world were dazzled by the event, with a further 600,000 lining the route from Buckingham Palace to the Cathedral. Charles and Diana spent their honeymoon on the Royal Yacht Britannia for a 12-day cruise through the Mediterranean to Egypt - and then stayed at Balmoral Castle. Diana had always longed for a big family. Within a year of her marriage, on 21 June 1982, she gave birth to a son, Prince William, who is second in line to the throne. She believed in giving her children as normal an upbringing as royal circumstances would allow. William became the first male heir to go to nursery. The boys were not educated by private teachers, but went to school with other children. In 1984, on 15 September, William had a brother. He was christened Henry, though he is known as Prince Harry. The princess quickly became involved in the official duties of the Royal Family. Soon, she was on a constant round of visits to nurseries, schools and hospitals. She showed a spontaneity and ability to connect with people which endeared her to the public. On her first official visit to the United States, the princess shared a dance with John Travolta at the White House. From the time of her appearance on her first public engagement with her then husband-to-be, Diana's wardrobe became a focus of attention. The princess's charity work strengthened her popularity with the public. She played an important role in publicising the plight of people with Aids. Her speeches on the subject were forthright and she did away with many prejudices. Simple gestures like shaking hands with Aids patients proved to the public that social contact was risk-free. The Prince and Princess of Wales carried out many engagements together and went on overseas tours. However, by the late 1980s their separate lives had become public knowledge. On an official visit to India in 1992, Diana sat alone outside the Taj Mahal, the great monument to love. It was a graphic public declaration that although the couple were formally together, they were in fact apart. Diana remained a doting mother to her two sons. Prince Harry has said that Diana was ""one of the naughtiest parents"", before adding: ""She smothered us with love, that's for sure."" Diana retained a close friendship with Mother Teresa throughout her life, as seen on this visit to a convent in Rome. The pair died within six days of each other. Diana gave a remarkably open interview to Martin Bashir and the BBC on 20 November 1995. Watched by millions, she described her post-natal depression, the breakdown of her marriage to Prince Charles and her tense relationship with the Royal Family as a whole. Throughout these troubles, the princess continued her charitable work. She visited Jemima Khan in Lahore, Pakistan, to support the cancer hospital run by Imran Khan, Jemima's then husband. Diana and Charles's divorce was finalised on 28 August 1996 and she officially became known as Diana, Princess of Wales. In June of the next year she auctioned off 79 dresses that had appeared on front covers of magazines around the world. The auction raised Â£3.5m ($4.5m) for charity and also seemed to symbolise a break with the past. On 31 August 1997, after dining at the Ritz Paris with Dodi Al Fayed, the son of millionaire businessman Mohamed Al Fayed, the pair left the restaurant in a limousine. They were pursued by photographers on motorbikes who wanted more snapshots of the princess's new friend. The chase led to tragedy in an underpass. More than one million people lined the route of the funeral cortege to Westminster Abbey and along her final journey to the Spencer family home in Northamptonshire. Her sons, William and Harry, were joined by Prince Charles, the Duke of Edinburgh and her brother Earl Spencer. All images subject to copyright.

Science funding: Will 'picking winners' work?,"In the 1980s, a Conservative government planned to make Britain's computer industry the best in the world by subsidising its research An ambitious Conservative minister has set out a strategy to turn the UK's scientific expertise into new products and services that will generate jobs and wealth for the economy. That was in 1983. The minister was Kenneth Clarke, who launched the Â£350m Alvey programme. It was designed to propel Britain to the forefront of advanced computing. But the policy of government subsidies for the research and development of favoured companies - known as ""picking winners"" - did not fit in with Margaret Thatcher's policy of introducing free market principles to the economy. Five years after its inception, the government pulled the plug on the Alvey programme. Thirty five years on, another Mr Clark, the Business Secretary, Greg Clark, announced Â£140m to support collaboration between industry and academia in the so-called life sciences sector, which develops innovative new medical treatments. The money was announced earlier this year - but details were revealed on Wednesday, to great fanfare. ""The life sciences industry is the most successful and most important we know,"" Mr Clark told reporters. ""Demand for this is going to increase in the years ahead, so what we are doing is to support a collaboration to get breakthroughs for patients and also create jobs."" The government's 1980s industrial strategy was led by an ambitious young minster, Ken Clarke So why is another Conservative government reviving a policy of subsidising industrial research when an earlier one junked it in the 1980s? It is because some high-tech companies and leading scientists have persuaded the Treasury and Downing Street that the policy was not wrong back then and should be given another go now. As a result, the prime minister and the chancellor announced an industrial strategy late last year. It is to be driven by UK research strengths, and they gave an extra Â£4.7bn pounds to spend on science over the next four years. The life sciences strategy is the first announcement of many that will aim to harness Britain's scientific strengths to benefit the economy. Business Secretary Greg Clark (far right) had a spell as science minister And while the word ""intervention"" does not sit easily with some Conservative politicians, the policy is being sold as part of the solution in the government's Brexit narrative. The formerly Remain-supporting Jeremy Hunt said: ""When we leave the EU, we will have a lot of money that we currently didn't have control over. ""What we are saying today is the life science industries [have a] very big opportunity. ""The government is backing those businesses that want Britain to be right at the very top of the pile to make those innovations."" Until recently, the Treasury has been suspicious of the way the nine separate scientific funding bodies spend public money. The process involves experts in the field deciding allocations based purely on scientific excellence. But the lack of coordination or strategic oversight made civil servants and ministers nervous of giving the funding bodies any serious money. That began to change in 2015, when Nobel Prize winner and director of the Crick Institute, Prof Sir Paul Nurse, persuaded the then Chancellor, George Osborne, that an umbrella body should be set up to both coordinate science funders and to consider how the research they were supporting fitted in with economic opportunities. The Treasury loved the idea. It was a marked departure from the autonomy the funding bodies had enjoyed in the past. But Sir Paul said proper oversight and coordination was the only way the UK could maintain its research excellence. George Osborne was persuaded that the science base could be harnessed to benefit the UK economy, when he was chancellor Government accepted Sir Paul's idea and set up the umbrella body, called United Kingdom Research and Innovation (UKRI). With it came the extra Â£4.7bn for science, with the possibility of more, maybe even much more, to come if the system delivers benefits to the economy. ""It is a massive sum that we haven't seen for decades that has been added to the science budget. So, I think we have everything to play for,"" says Sir Paul. There is concern though that ministers will interfere, directing funding away from the best research and toward those areas that are socially, economically and politically important to them. Sir Paul believes such concerns to be ""scaremongering"". ""For science to play its proper role in promoting benefit for society it's very important to invest in [pure] research,"" he says, ""but also to think about how those fundamental discoveries may be translated into useful objectives that will bring advances for society."" Prof Sir Paul Nurse is the mastermind behind the new funding strategy Thirty five years on from the launch of the Alvey programme, do we have another Conservative government that is not afraid of picking winners? The author of the new life sciences strategy document, Prof Sir John Bell, of Oxford University says he hopes so. ""If you look around the world, it's important to think why you're doing an industrial strategy, and I think it's to try to identify sectors where you are likely to see very substantial economic expansion,"" he says. ""Everyone thinks that the US is a completely capitalist free-market enterprise, but the truth is they pour billions of pounds into subsidising their life sciences industry in a whole variety of different ways.""

'No decisive progress' on Brexit - Barnier,"This video can not be played Michel Barnier, EU's chief Brexit negotiator: UK's requests are ""simply impossible"" Both the UK and EU have expressed frustration at the pace of Brexit talks amid disagreement over the size of the UK's ""divorce bill"". EU negotiator Michel Barnier said the UK did not feel ""legally obliged to honour its obligations"" after Brexit. He said ""no decisive progress"" had been made on key issues, following the third round of talks. But Brexit Secretary David Davis said the UK had a ""duty to our taxpayers"" to ""rigorously"" examine the EU's demands. And he urged the EU to be ""more imaginative and flexible"" in its approach. During a joint press conference, Mr Barnier acknowledged there had been some ""fruitful"" discussions on the issues surrounding the relationship between the Republic of Ireland and Northern Ireland, but he struck a pessimistic tone overall. He stressed that he was ""impatientâ¦ I am not angryâ¦ I am impatient and determined"" about the progress of negotiations, adding that ""time is flying"" and the EU was willing to intensify the ""rhythm"" of talks. Behind their polished podium performances, it's clear there are major gaps between the stance of Michel Barnier and David Davis which are not being bridged. Money is the big sticking point of course, although the phraseology around the issue is a little more elegant than that, and the language at these moments can give you a real feel for the underlying atmosphere. Mr Barnier says that after this week ""it's clear that the UK doesn't feel legally obliged to honour its obligations"". Mr Davis claims it's natural that the UK would want to ""interrogate rigorously"" any demand placed on its taxpayers. But he is also careful to note that Britain is a country that meets its obligations - moral as well as legal; it just expects them to be properly specified. Read more This video can not be played David Davis, Brexit secretary: ""I think it's fair to say we've seen some concrete progress"" The UK wants to begin trade talks as soon as possible, but Brussels insists that discussions about the future relationship after Brexit can only begin once ""sufficient progress"" has been made on the arrangements for withdrawal - including on the so-called ""divorce fee"". Mr Barnier said that at the current rate of progress, he was quite far from being able to recommend opening parallel talks on a future trade relationship with the UK. Reality check: Why it's all about money Brexit: All you need to know 'Fruitful' talks on Irish issues At-a-glance guide to Brexit negotiations Brexit: What is at stake in EU-UK talks? He cited two areas where ""trust"" needed to be built between the two sides - on citizens' rights and the financial settlement, stressing that 27 members of the bloc should not have to pay for obligations taken by 28. Claiming there had been a shift in the UK government's approach, he said: ""In July the UK recognised that it has obligations beyond the Brexit date but this week the UK explained that these obligations will be limited to the last payment to the EU project before departure."" No figure has yet been put on the payment, but European Commission president Jean-Claude Juncker has suggested it could come in at around 60 billion euro (Â£55bn), while unconfirmed reports have put it as high as 100 billion euro (Â£92bn). Mr Davis defended the ""rigorous"" line-by-line examination of the EU's demands carried out by British officials in response to the ""unspecified but undoubtedly large"" sum demanded by Brussels. He added: ""It will, of course, lead to difficult exchanges - nobody will pretend it was anything but a tough exchange this week - but I think the British taxpayer would expect nothing less."" Former Labour PM Tony Blair was also in Brussels for talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker Mr Davis also told reporters the talks had exposed how the UK approach was ""substantially more flexible and pragmatic than that of the EU"". ""This week we have had long and detailed discussions across multiple areas and I think it's fair to say we have seen some concrete progress, and Michel referred to one but there's more than that,"" he said. ""However, as I said at the start of the week, it's only through flexibility and imagination that we will achieve a deal that works truly for both sides. ""In some areas we have found this from the [European] Commission's side, which I welcome, but there remains some way to go."" He added: ""Beyond the debates about process and technicalities, at the heart of this process, must be a desire to deliver the best outcome for the people and the businesses of the European Union and the United Kingdom,"" he added - particularly on citizens' rights.

Tory MPs sceptical about PMâs ambitions,"This video can not be played The prime minister made her comments in Kyoto on the first day of a three-day visit to Japan Some Conservative backbenchers have said they do not believe Theresa May will be able to fight the next general election as prime minister. Their comments follow Mrs May's claim she was ""here for the long term"". Labour said she was ""deluding herself"" - but Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson led her defence, insisting she could win an absolute majority. However, ex-Conservative Party chairman Grant Shapps said it was ""too early to be talking about going on and on"". Theresa May: I'm here for the long term Reality Check: Japan's position on UK trade deal Brexit progress 'slow' says Verhofstadt Having had ""conversations with 50 or so colleagues"" in the run-up to the summer, Mr Shapps said: ""The truth is we ran a very poor election and you can't just brush that under the table and pretend it didn't happen - not least because we went from having a workable majority to no majority at all, so that stands to reason."" He added that while there was no mood for a leadership election, Mrs May's remarks ""will certainly raise some eyebrows"". The prime minister says she has a lengthy agenda and is not just focused on Brexit ""Let's get some performance, let's get some delivery for the British people and then let's see where we are, rather than vice versa,"" Mr Shapps told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. The former Tory Chancellor, George Osborne, who became a newspaper editor after being sacked by Mrs May, compared her premiership to the ""Living Dead in a second-rate horror film"". The former education secretary Nicky Morgan told BBC's Hardtalk it would be ""difficult"" for Mrs May to lead the party into the next election, due in 2022. But former Conservative leader Lord Howard told BBC Radio 4's World at One that she ""should stay on"". ""I think she was quite right to say what she said today. She has quite rightly said there's a job to be done. I think the government is back on track."" And Graham Brady, the chairman of the 1922 Committee of backbench Tory MPs told Sky News that the parliamentary Conservative party was not concerned with ""the leadership question"". ""We certainly want the prime minister to get on serving the national interest doing that job for our country. We don't want people distracted,"" he said. Theresa May didn't set off to the Far East to deliver a message that she would ""go on and on"". But have her interviews changed the facts on the ground? While some MPs were swiftly deployed to make clear she can indeed stay on, from my soundings the former party chairman Grant Shapps and former Number 10 communications chief Katie Perrior are nearer the mark. The former told the BBC her performance would be assessed post-Brexit, while the latter - admitting that Theresa May could have said little else in response to questions about her future - believes she still won't lead the party into the next election. Lack of appetite for a leadership contest, never mind a general election, among her MPs means it's quite safe for the prime minister to say what she said - but it doesn't mean it's any more accurate than her repeated assurances that she wouldn't call a snap election.Read more Debate over Mrs May's long-term ambitions was sparked after she told the BBC's Ben Wright in Kyoto that it was her intention to lead her party into another general election, whenever that was. ""Yes, I'm here for the long term. What me and my government are about is not just delivering on Brexit but delivering a brighter future for the UK,"" she said. Mrs May said she wanted to ensure ""global Britain"" could take its trading place in the world, as well as dealing with ""those injustices domestically that we need to do to ensure that strong, more global, but also fairer Britain for the future"". Emphasising her stance on Thursday, she told reporters: ""I said I wasn't a quitter. There's a long-term job to do, there's an important job to be done in the UK.  Yes, that's partly about Brexit and getting Brexit right, but if you think back to what I said when I became prime minister, when I stood in Downing Street, there are many other issues that we need to address."" The prime minister has been under pressure after losing her Commons majority in a snap election called earlier this year. Some reports had suggested she could stand down in 2019 after EU withdrawal. But speaking on a visit to Nigeria, Mr Johnson, who received public backing from Mrs May after recent criticism of his performance, said: ""I've made it clear I'm giving my undivided backing to Theresa May. ""We need to get Brexit done. ""She's ideally placed to deliver a great outcome for our country and then deliver what we all want to see, which is this exciting agenda of global Britain. ""I think she gets it.  She really wants to deliver it.  I'm here to support her."" Theresa May launching her leadership bid in June 2016 The UK is due to leave the EU in March 2019 and supporters of Mrs May have said leadership speculation serves only to undermine attempts to secure the best possible terms of exit. Shadow Cabinet Office minister Jon Trickett said the prime minister was ""deluding herself"" about her plan to stay in power until the next election. ""Neither the public nor Tory MPs believe her fantasy of staying on till 2022,"" he said. ""Theresa May leads a zombie government."" Katie Perrior, former director of communications at Downing Street, said while she also did not believe Mrs May would fight the next general election as Conservative leader, the PM could not have answered any differently in the ""middle of Brexit negotiations"". The next general election is not scheduled to take place until May 2022, by which point Mrs May - if she stayed in Downing Street - would have been prime minister for nearly six years. In the immediate aftermath of her party's failure to win June's general election outright, several MPs called on her to consider her position. The prime minister has sought to consolidate her position by negotiating a governing agreement with the Democratic Unionists and overhauling the way Downing Street works, replacing key advisers. On the second day of her trip to Japan, Mrs May will hold official talks with her counterpart Shinzo Abe and emphasise the growing security links between the two countries.

Airport currency rates hit new low,"Travellers buying their currencies at UK airports are being offered as little as 86 euro cents to the pound. Foreign exchange broker FairFx, which carried out a survey for the BBC, said this rate, from Moneycorp at Southampton airport, was the worst at any airport bureau de change. The average euro rate across 16 big UK airports was higher, at 95 euro cents to the pound. Ten months ago the average at these outlets stood at 99 euro cents. James Hickman, chief commercial officer at FairFX, said the fact that airport rates were so low - much worse even than at High Street banks - showed that the bureaux de change firms were taking advantage. ""In reality they are ripping off the customer, who is effectively captive as they have nowhere else to buy their money at an airport,"" he said. ""At most airports and terminals individual companies have a monopoly. ""They should be regulated as there is simply no justification for charging someone 14% [the average margin between the tourist and money market rates] to change their pounds to euros,"" he added. Why is the pound so low against the euro? Tourists warned over exchange rate costs That margin is as high as 26% at Moneycorp's Southampton airport outlet. Pauline Maguire, Moneycorp's retail director, said: ""The reason for our higher airport rates is the significant cost associated with operating there - from ground rent and additional security, to the cost of staffing the bureaux for customers on early and late flights. ""An easy and more cost-effective way for customers to buy travel money is to pre-order online and collect at the airport."" The best euro rate for tourists detected in the airport survey was 1.05 euros, from Travelex at Newcastle airport. The average tourist rate for the pound against the US dollar is also very low. Currently the average is $1.12 to the pound at UK airports, ranging from $1.05 at ICE at Norwich airport to $1.15 from Travelex at Heathrow Terminal 3. Some of Moneycorp's exchange rates on Monday 28 August at Gatwick Airport's North Terminal Koko Sarkari, chief executive of ICE, which runs bureaux de change at Belfast, Birmingham, Heathrow and Luton airports, dismissed the idea his firm was exploiting a captive market. ""We work hard to keep our prices fair and competitive around the world,"" he said. ""However, due to differences in distribution, costs of operation, regional competition and other factors such as ongoing volatility in the market, as we are experiencing now, online prices may not be the same as our ICE branch prices and prices may also vary between branches because of these factors."" Several BBC website readers have told us about their recent experiences when changing their money at UK airports. Helen Stanfield flew to Iceland at the start of August from Gatwick. ""I asked at the Moneycorp desk for the exchange rate from pounds into Icelandic Kroner and was told it was 99 to the pound,"" she said. ""I walked away and used my card at an ATM in Reykjavik airport to get local currency - at a rate of 135 to the pound!"" Jonathan Lilley was annoyed to find the walk-up rate an one airport was so much lower than the online offer. ""I turned up for my holiday flight and found that Travelex's euro exchange rate was not even 1 euro to the pound, when the same firm's pre-booked rate was about 1.08 euros,"" he said. No-one is forced to buy holiday money at the last moment at an airport. This potentially expensive experiencecan be avoidedby: buying online, in advance, from the outlet of your choice: a bank, Post Office or bureau de change elsewhere if you have a good reason to pick up cash at an airport, order it online in advance and use the airport bureau de change as the pick-up point consider spending abroad with a pre-pay travel money card, or a no-fee credit card marketed for travellers abroad for sheer convenience you may be tempted to use your bank debit card at foreign ATMs, but beware of steep charges. One reason for the poor rates on offer to tourists has been the continued decline of the pound on the foreign exchange markets, in the wake of last year's Brexit vote. Although in the past 12 months it has only fallen from $1.31 to $1.29, against the euro the drop has been much steeper. In that time the pound has gone from 1.18 euros to 1.08 euros. Continuing Brexit uncertainty is feeding into sterling weakness, said Simon Derrick, a managing director at BNY Mellon. Traders are looking to see what will happen over the next two months, with the attempted incorporation of EU law into UK legislation through the Great Repeal Bill, and EU negotiator Michel Barnier reporting back to the European Parliament on Brexit talks. However, there are two sides to the story. The euro is also getting stronger because ""the eurozone economy is really starting to show some signs of life,"" Mr Derrick said.

Nurseries warn of 30-hour care 'chaos',"Parents across England will be able to claim 30 hours of free childcare a week from 1 September More than half of parents eligible to receive 30 hours' free childcare a week have now applied to take part in the scheme, the government says. From 1 September most parents in England are entitled to the free care for children aged three to four. However, education charities warned the scheme will cause ""chaos"" as it is underfunded and some nurseries may be forced to close. The government says families could save Â£5,000 per year on childcare costs. The Department for Education (DfE) says more than 200,000 parents have now successfully applied to receive the free childcare hours. In total, 390,000 parents are eligible to receive help from the government with their childcare costs. Am I eligible for 30 hours' free childcare? Eligible parents have until midnight to register with the government to take advantage of the offer. Education Secretary Justine Greening said: ""For too long lots of families really struggled to manage the cost of childcare and that's why we have delivered on our promise to provide 30 hours free"". 51% of eligible parents have so far signed up to take advantage of the free childcare scheme Education charities and nursery providers are warning though that the new scheme is underfunded, and that parents may face higher costs and nurseries could close. A survey by the Pre-school Learning Alliance (PLA), which received answers from 1,400 nursery providers in England found: 74% of respondents said their current funding from the government would not cover the cost of delivering the 30-hour free childcare places 38% do not believe their business would be sustainable in 12 months' time 52% said they will increase charges for products such as children's meals, nappies and trips 42% were not confident they would be offering enough free childcare places to meet the expected demand ""The launch of the 30-hours offer should have been a day of celebration. Instead, all we have is a policy in chaos,"" said Neil Leitch, chief executive of the PLA. ""The government's total refusal to tackle, or even acknowledge, the fundamental problem of early years underfunding has left providers across the country struggling to find ways of delivering the offer that won't force them out of business"". The free childcare concept was at the centre of the Conservative's 2015 election manifesto, unveiled by former Prime Minister David Cameron Karen Simpkin, who runs a nursery in Sheffield, said she will offer only a limited number of free places. ""It costs me Â£7.50 an hour to look after a child in my nursery, but I'm only going to get Â£4.07 an hour from the government. I already know that I'm going to make a loss"". Previously parents in England have been entitled to 15 hours of free childcare per week, but during the2015 general election the Conservatives promised to double this entitlement. Both theWelsh,externalandScottish,externalgovernments have pledged to give parents access to 30 hours of free childcare in the coming years. These parents in Leeds broadly welcomed the introduction of 30 hours free child care Parents in Leeds are enthusiastic about the scheme,but some expressed frustrations about the registration system. ""I'm still hoping to get the 30 hours free, but I've found the online process really frustrating,"" said Rachel Wright. ""At one point it felt like I had to answer 20,000 questions"". ""In principle the idea is a fantastic,"" said Lucy Flahaerty. ""But I do realise that we may have to pay extra money for additional things such as food, but overall we are still going to make a saving."" Adam Dean said: ""It's all been straightforward for us and the nursery has been really helpful. I think this is going to save us a lot of money in the long run."" Over 200,000 parents in England have signed up to take part in the new scheme according to the government Overall theDepartment for Education has allocated Â£2.7bn toward funding the scheme in 2017/18,external, with local authorities receiving, on average, Â£4.78 per hour to provide the free childcare places. Minister for Children and Families Robert Goodwill said: ""We are determined to support as many families as possible with access to high-quality, affordable childcare, which is why we are investing a record Â£6bn every year by 2020 in childcare - more than ever before - and doubling the free childcare available to working parents to 30 hours a week, saving them up to Â£5,000 a year per child. ""This funding includes an additional Â£1bn per year by 2019-20 to pay for the free offers and to raise the national hourly rate to local authorities for three  and four year olds to Â£4.94 per hour. This is far higher than the average hourly cost of providing childcare for three- and four-year-olds, which recent research has found to be Â£3.72. ""The 30-hour offer is already being delivered in several areas across the country, with over 15,000 children benefitting from a place. ""We know from our evaluation that providers are committed to offering 30 hours and the additional hours are having a really positive impact on families, taking huge pressures off families' finances.""

Reality Check: Japan's position on UK trade deal,"The UK Prime Minister, Theresa May, is in Japan for a three-day visit to drum up business and trade opportunities. Her main aim is to try to convince Japan that London and Tokyo are perfect partners for the post-Brexit world. But, here's aReality Checkon why she may find it a hard sell. Building a future trading relationship between Japan and the UK is crucial for the prime minister on this trip. She said her discussions with the Japanese Prime Minister, Shinzo Abe, ""will focus on how we can prepare the ground for an ambitious free trade agreement after Brexit, based on the EU-Japan agreement, which I very much hope is nearing conclusion."" But she may find that the gap between what she hopes for and the current reality is very wide indeed. May's Japan visit: Step up pressure on North Korea Aston Martin in Â£500m UK-Japan deal Video: Is Japan's economy bouncing back? Japan is a major investor in the UK, no doubt. Japanese companies currently invest about Â£40bn in the UK, and more than 1,000 Japanese companies employ 140,000 people across the country. About 40% of these Japanese companies are in manufacturing - and many of them chose the UK as their headquarters because they wanted access to the European Union's market. So it is in Tokyo's interests to cement a trade deal with the UK as soon as possible. Except that what Tokyo wants may not be what Mrs May can give - or not right now at least. ""Japanese companies are getting frustrated with the lack of answers from Mrs May on a concrete position vis a vis EU access,"" Seijiro Takeshita, from the University of Shizuoka, tells me. ""Mrs May can't answer that yet. And because she's not giving any concrete measures, that is exacerbating the worries of Japanese companies."" Privately, some in Tokyo's business circles are saying that Japanese companies based in the UK are already looking for alternative sites in Europe for their headquarters and manufacturing sites. Compound that with the fact that the focus for the Japanese is completing the ""cars for cheese"" trade deal they hammered out with the EU in July, and you can see why this trip may not go all that well for Mrs May. ""The EU is a much larger economy, and the reason why so many Japanese companies were in the UK in the first place was to get access to the EU market,"" says Mr Takeshita. The EU-Japan deal is a priority for Tokyo. It took four years and 18 rounds of negotiations, and it still needs to be ironed out, so ""Japan will be distracted for now with that, and with the conclusion of the TPP-11 [Trans-Pacific Partnership] deal in Sydney"", says Deborah Elms, from the Asian Trade Centre. ""Also, much of the investments from Japan into the EU are currently structured through the UK, so the Japanese will be looking for assurances from Mrs May about how they will be looked after, once the divorce between the UK and the EU is completed."" Add to that the fact the North Korea security issue will be very much on the minds of the Japanese, which may take the spotlight away from trade and on to security. Again, all very bad timing for Mrs May. For a quarter of a century, the UK has been a key part of Toyota's global operations. She is going to want to return to London with assurances from Japan that it will sign a similar deal with the UK to the one it signed with the EU. After all, the UK's exports to Japan in 2016 were worth Â£11.6bn, a 10% increase from the year before. Much of that came from goods and services such as machinery and finance, which make up important sectors of the UK economy. The prime minister is taking with her a whole bevy of British companies to Japan, to show Tokyo that the UK means business. But until the UK can spell out exactly what the divorce from the EU looks like, it's possible Mrs May won't come home with anything substantial.

Public marks 20 years since Diana's death,"Tributes are being paid to Princess Diana on the 20th anniversary of her death. Dubbed the ""people's princess"" by then prime minister Tony Blair, she died after a car crash in Paris on 31 August 1997 aged 36. On Wednesday, her sons - Prince William and Prince Harry -visited the growing floral tributesbeing left at Kensington Palace. Harry told members of charities Diana supported, ""all of us lost somebody"". How has Princess Diana's death changed the Royal Family? Diana's embrace: The legacy she left her sons In pictures: Diana, Princess of Wales The princes are marking the anniversary in private, but other public services are taking place across the UK - including at East London's Mildmay Mission Hospital, which the princess regularly visited when it was a hospice caring for HIV patients. Former members of staff will share their memories of her, alongside the hospital's patron, actress Linda Robson, and dancer Wayne Sleep, who performed with the princess. This video can not be played William and Harry greeted people and looked at the flowers left outside Kensington Palace Members of the public have been visiting Kensington Palace, where Diana had lived for more than 15 years during her marriage to Prince Charles and after their divorce. Princess Diana remembered: 'I left flowers in 1997' 'The day I met Princess Diana' BBC News correspondent Mark Lobel spoke to Terry - who had met the princess through his charity work - as he laid roses for her outside the gates. ""It was a privilege [to meet her],"" he said. ""I was under Waterloo Bridge, giving out blankets and food to the homeless. I don't know what made her come, but she looked down at us all and we were all amazed, just like a little angel came out. ""She spoke to us all. She was very sweet. It was unbelievable. Everybody gave her a smile and she gave them a lovely smile too."" This video can not be played Jennie Bond: 'It was a kind of mass hysteria' Speaking to the BBC's Sophie Long, John - who had been at Kensington Palace since early morning - said Diana ""brought happiness to everyone."" ""It is important for us to be here,"" he added. ""Princess Diana always ran to the crowd, embraced you and picked you up. No other royal has ever done that."" People left tributes near to the Alma Bridge tunnel where the crash happened 20 years ago By Hugh Schofield, BBC News Paris correspondent There are quite a few people at the unofficial Diana memorial at the Alma Bridge tunnel today.  But most, you sense, are passers-by attracted by the TV cameras. The days of pilgrimage to the scene of her death are long gone - which is as it should be. For those of us who were in France at the time, the 20th anniversary has been a moment to cast back one's mind,  and recapture the somewhat surreal atmosphere that surrounded the whole affair. Partly it was a sense of wonder at the sheer unlikelihood of it all, partly it was excitement and partly it was just plain sadness. An old friend, Tim Livesey, was embassy press officer at the time, and drove with the ambassador to the hospital late in the night. He remembers the doctor coming out at four in the morning and uttering the words: ""Elle est morte."" He told me: ""I will never forget the way he said the word 'morte'.  It was like a glass smashing on a marble floor. It was the end."" Deborah Gold, chief executive of the National Aids Trust, said the princess had raised understanding and changed minds with her charity work. ""[Diana] was responsible for one of the biggest shifts in public attitudes towards Aids by being really willing to talk to people, touch people and to shame public attitudes,"" she said. ""There was such a high level of misinformation about HIV and a real fear of people living with HIV that made lives for them extremely difficult. ""She just challenged that so powerfully at Middlesex Hospital where she shook the hand of the man living with HIV and showed how ridiculous those fears were."" Sir Elton John, a close friend of Diana's and fellow HIV and Aids campaigner, paid tribute to her on Instagram. The singer, who performed an alternative version of his song Candle In The Wind at her funeral, posted a picture of the two of them and wrote: ""20 years ago today, the world lost an angel. #RIP"" Members of the public are laying tributes at Kensington Palace Ken Wharfe, a personal protection officer to the princess and a bodyguard to her two sons, said her children always came before her royal duties. ""Work certainly broke a new mould in terms of royal duty,"" he told the Victoria Derbyshire programme. ""But behind all that, wherever we were in the country or abroad, it was, 'I must get back and see my boys'. That was always crucial in her life. ""She generated the fun with her kids, but also with us on tour. She was almost the entertainment manager and she would always find something to make people laugh. ""William and Harryâ¦ are using their mother's template because they know it is one that works. It was her work ethos that endeared her to the public.""

Building collapse traps people in Mumbai,"This video can not be played Scenes from fatal Mumbai building collapse At least 21 people have died and 21 others have been rescued after a building collapse in Mumbai. Rescuers say they will keep looking for survivors through the night. A six-storey building toppled over in India's financial capital on Thursday. The building in the densely populated Bhendi Bazaar area was believed to be about 100 years old. Ambulances, fire engines and members of the disaster relief force are still working at the site. Mumbai is recovering from heavy rains and flooding. The residential building gave way around 08:40 India time [03:10 GMT], reports said. Ambulances, fire engines and members of the disaster relief force are working at the site Suranjana Tewari, BBC News Mumbai This is the third building collapse in Mumbai in less than a month. Police suspect that Tuesday's torrential rain weakened the structure of the building that collapsed. Whether that's proven or not, questions are likely to be asked about why so many residents of this growing city are allowed to go on living in old and dilapidated properties. Property prices and rent in Mumbai are among the highest in Asia. High quality housing is in short supply and so people have no choice but to live in sub-standard and crowded buildings. This particular building was slated for redevelopment but people were clearly still living inside it even though it was about 100 years old. Municipal authorities say they have stepped up efforts to evacuate dangerous buildings and demolish them. Clearly that isn't happening fast enough. Why people live in Mumbai's dangerous buildings In pictures: India building collapses Building accidents are not uncommon in India, particularly during the monsoon season. Poor construction standards and dilapidation are often to blame. Every year, dozens of people are killed in building collapses across India. There have been three in Mumbai in the past month. In July,17 people were killedwhen a four-storey building collapsed in the suburb of Ghatkopar. Are you in the area?

Mattis sees room for diplomacy with N Korea,"This video can not be played Footage of a missile being launched over northern Japan was broadcast on state-run television US Defence Secretary James Mattis has said the US is ""never out of diplomatic solutions"" in dealing with North Korea. It comes after President Donald Trump tweeted that ""talking is not the answer"" to the country's military ambitions. Russia has also warned the US against taking military action, saying it would be ""fraught with unpredictable consequences"". North Korea caused alarm by firing a missile over Japan on Tuesday. The missile, which Japan called an ""unprecedented"" threat, crossed the northern Hokkaido region early on Tuesday, triggering public alerts to take cover, before landing in the sea about 1,180km (730 miles) off the coast. North Korea later said it was""the first step"" of wider military operationsin the Pacific, and repeated its threats to the US Pacific island of Guam. Tensions have been particularly high in recent days, as the US and South Korea conducted annual joint military exercises which always anger Pyongyang. On Thursday, as the exercises came to an end, aircraft from the two nations - including two US nuclear-capable bombers and several fighter jets - carried out a live fire drill in South Korea in an apparent show of force. The drill took place at a range in Gangwon province, 150km south of the Demilitarized Zone Two US B-1B bombers and four US stealth fighters flew with South Korean planes Just days ago, Mr Trump had said he believed North Korean leader Kim Jong-un was ""starting to respect"" the US. But in a tweet late on Wednesday, he said: ""The US has been talking to North Korea, and paying them extortion money, for 25 years. Talking is not the answer!"" Allow Twitter content?

Contain, strike or invade: The military options Russia, which shares a tiny border with North Korea and a maritime border with Japan, has said that US military activity in the region is partly to blame for the increase in tensions. In a phone call on Wednesday, Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson that diplomacy was the only way to overcome tensions on the Korean peninsula, which have been escalating in recent months. A military solution would be ""fraught with unpredictable consequences,"" Reuters quoted Mr Lavrov as saying. He also said any further strengthening of sanctions against North Korea by the UN would be counter-productive. Meeting on Tuesday, the UN Security Council had unanimously condemned the launch and again demanded North Korea cease all missile testing. But it did not push for new sanctions. Speaking in Geneva at a UN Conference on Disarmament, North Korean diplomat Ju Yong-chol insisted the North would not be stifled and ""will not hesitate to take further tougher counter-measures."" He said Pyongyang strongly rejected the ""fabricated"" stories that it was to blame for the tensions of the Korean peninsula. North Korea has been working on its missile programme for decades, with weapons based on the Soviet-developed Scud It has conducted short- and medium-range tests on many occasions, sometimes to mark domestic events or at times of regional tension In recent months the pace of testing has increased; experts say North Korea appears to be making significant advances towards its goal of building a reliable long-range nuclear-capable weapon In July, North Korea launched two missiles which it said were Inter-Continental Ballistic Missiles (ICBMs) capable of hitting the US; experts believe they put parts of the US in range There is no consensus on how close North Korea is to miniaturising a nuclear warhead to put on a missile Have North Korea's missile tests paid off?
