Benefit scam pushed on social media,"Scam victim Sophie Vickery says comments on social media encouraged her to go ahead with the application Fraudsters are using social media to promote a scam exploiting loopholes in the welfare benefit Universal Credit. BBC News has found Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat pages plugging the scam, which can leave victims owing hundreds. Separately, the BBC has been told that the homeless, drug users and even jobless young Britons in Spain are also becoming victims. Ministers say they are working with social media sites to shut down accounts that promote fraud. A spokesperson for Facebook said: ""We do not allow fraudulent activity."" On MondayBBC News revealed that tens of millions of pounds are feared to have been stolen by fraudsters,exploiting a loophole in universal credit. While many of those scammed have been approached directly, sometimes by people claiming to be from the job centre, we have now discovered a number of social media sites are promoting the scam. Fraud victims may still have to pay money claimed Woman's benefits pocketed by online loan company Arrests in Blackburn welfare benefit theft scam On Facebook, the pages include Gov Grants Same Day, Same Day Grant, Discretionary Budgeting Grant and Same Day Grant Payment. Instagram sites include Same Day Drop UK, while Moneyinaminute is also advertising the fraud on Snapchat. Some of the sites have been operating for months, with dozens of people contacting the fraudsters asking for details on how to get the ""grants"" or ""free money"" they are offering. This page, on Instagram, uses official looking logos to reassure would-be claimants Healthcare assistant Sophie Vickery, from Plymouth, says she was encouraged to apply for one of the ""grants"" after reading Facebook comments from people who had apparently already done it and were happy. Sophie was initially cautious, but the people running the page assured her that she had nothing to lose if she went ahead. She even asked if it was a loan and not a grant ""and they said 'No. It's a government grant. You don't have to pay it back'."" When she eventually decided to go ahead she received the money within two hours. ""I got Â£1,200 and kept Â£600 and transferred the other Â£600 to them,"" she said. She had been on tax credits but found herself moved on to universal credit, which she fears will make her worse off. ""I didn't really think much of it. It wasn't until the next day when I went to view my tax credits, I knew something was really wrong."" It quickly became clear that the person who had made the claim on her behalf had invented email addresses, given false answers to security questions and said she had five children, when she only has two. She has made a fraud claim, but feels frightened and ashamed and fears she will have to pay back all the money. ""It was like I had fallen into a big black hole and I didn't know how to get out."" The scammers have, in some cases, been taking as much as Â£1,000 from victims after secretly claiming Â£1,500 from universal credit on their behalf. One bogus claim gave the names of five non-existent children as Give, Me, Some, Money, Now. The BBC has also been told that scammers are targeting homeless hostels and drug users and young British workers in Ibiza who are between jobs. Since our revelations on Monday, several officials from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) have been in touch, furious that the scam has been allowed to continue. One told us: ""Believe me when I tell you that Â£20m is nowhere near the truth. As front-line staff we have been pulling our hair out on this one for so long. ""At my job centre we are seeing between 15 and 20 false claims per day, each one scamming Â£1,500."" This Facebook page promises almost instant cash The staff member added that fraudsters came into their job centre several times a day with different people to open new claims with false information. The DWP says it is aware of the fraud and has a team of 120 people looking to identify the culprits. Some senior officials admit they are as frustrated as the front-line staff at what is happening. But another official told us: ""There is an easy fix to this debacle. ""Allow and limit online universal credit advances to their standard allowance only - to cover immediate expenses - and exclude everything else, until the claimant comes into the office for the next part of the claims process where further verification can be done as required."" In a statement, a DWP spokesman said: ""Sadly, criminals will always attempt to defraud the benefit system. ""The department is committed to bringing fraudsters to justice - last year we reclaimed more than Â£1.1bn in fraud and error and brought more than 5,000 prosecutions. ""We are already working with social media sites like Facebook to shut down accounts that promote fraud. ""Our dedicated team investigates all fraudulent advance claims referred to them, which represent less than 1% of all claims. ""Where there is clear evidence that people have been scammed out of money, they will not be asked to repay it."" Have you been a victim of a scam like this or been affected by this story?

England thrash Australia to reach final,"This video can not be played Highlights: England reach World Cup final ICC Men's Cricket World Cup, Edgbaston Australia 223 all out (49 overs):Smith 85, Woakes 3-20, Rashid 3-54 England 226-2 (32.1 overs):Roy 85, Root 49*, Morgan 45* England won by eight wickets Scorecard England surged into their first World Cup final for 27 years with a sensational eight-wicket demolition of Australia at Edgbaston. The hosts will have the chance to lift the trophy for the first time when they meet New Zealand at Lord's on Sunday. A first win in a World Cup knockout match since 1992 was secured over the defending champions on a day that will live long in the memory, justifiably alongside anything from the 2005 Ashes or the 2010-11 tour of Australia. It was built on a riotous opening seven overs, when Australia were reduced to 14-3 by the new-ball brilliance of Chris Woakes and Jofra Archer. Steve Smith, so often England's nemesis, held Australia together with 85, helping them to a total of 223 that at least gave them something to bowl at. But home nerves over the menacing presence of Mitchell Starc were allayed by a prolific opening partnership between Jason Roy and Jonny Bairstow, who added 124 for the first wicket. Roy crashed 85 before Joe Root and Eoin Morgan took England to their target with 17.5 overs to spare. The ease of England's progression to the final was such a contrast to the group-stage defeat by Australia that left them on the brink of elimination. Since then they have beaten India, New Zealand and turned in this, their best performance of the tournament to date. They will start the final, which will beshown as free-to-air on Channel 4,as firm favourites to be crowned world champions. Reaching final beyond belief - England captain Morgan 'Souped-up, fire-breathing, chest-beating England can go all the way' TMS podcast: Is cricket coming home? This video can not be played Roy smashes Smith for three sixes in a row Until Saturday's final round of group games, England were set to play India in this match. Although they would never admit it, the opportunity to play their oldest enemies at a ground where Australia have no win of any kind since 2001 and England had won their previous 10 matches was absolutely perfect. The toss seemed like a huge boost for Aaron Finch's men - batting first has been a big advantage in the tournament - but that was to discount the carnage that would follow. Edgbaston exploded with noise as Finch, David Warner and Peter Handscomb were removed, cheers that were matched in volume by the boos for Warner and Smith. Although Smith ensured what the crowd knew could have been a tricky chase - they cheered as Roy defended Starc's first over - Roy injected belief with an outrageous flick for six off the left-armer. As it became clearer that England were strolling, the party moved through the gears. Starc was serenaded with the song that tortured Mitchell Johnson, and the Hollies Stand howled as Smith was launched for three consecutive sixes by Roy. By the end, as the rain fell, the whole of Edgbaston was telling the world that cricket is coming home. Hamilton unhappy British GP clashes with Cricket World Cup final and Wimbledon England are the benchmark - Finch Relive the best clips and reaction to England's victory This was a complete display by England, who were magnificent with the ball, sharp in the field and dominant with the bat. Woakes (3-20) and Archer (2-32) nipped the new ball around on a full length. Archer trapped Finch lbw with his first ball, Woakes got one to climb that Warner fended to first slip, then bowled Handscomb through the gate. Archer also left Alex Carey needing stitches from a blow to the chin, but the left-hander recovered to make 46 in a stand of 103 with Smith. This video can not be played 'I've never seen that before!' - Archer bouncer knocks Carey's helmet off At 117-3, the game was delicately poised, before Carey needlessly holed out off Adil Rashid, who removed Marcus Stoinis in the same over and later had Pat Cummins caught at slip in a lovely spell of 3-54. Smith remained through it all, only to be run out by wicketkeeper Jos Buttler's direct hit that somehow went between the batsman's legs - an action symptomatic of a day when everything went right for England. After the dangerous Starc's early overs were negotiated, Roy cut loose with fearsome power - the third of his sixes off Smith was a monstrous hit into the top tier of the stand. Although Bairstow was trapped leg before by Starc for 34 and an angry Roy was wrongly adjudged to have hooked Pat Cummins behind, Root and Morgan were untroubled in an unbroken stand of 79. After the match, Roy was fined 30% of his match fee and given two demerit points for showing dissent at his dismissal. This video can not be played 'I'm sorry Jason, the review has been used' - Roy angry after being given out incorrectly Given their team for this tournament only really came together at the last minute, it is to Australia's credit that they made the semi-finals with such ease. But here they were ambushed by England and now must regroup before the Ashes begin on this ground on 1 August. As his team-mates crumbled around him, Smith stood tall, blocking out the abuse to accumulate with his trademark fidgety efficiency. Indeed, had Carey hung around, England's task could have been difficult but, after he departed, wickets fell with regularity. When Smith was beaten by Buttler's throw to become the eighth man out, he shook his head all the way to the pavilion, unable to conceal his disappointment. To stand any chance, Australia needed early wickets and when they failed to materialise, they were powerless to prevent Roy's awesome hitting. This video can not be played Megs! Smith run out through his legs England captain Eoin Morgan:""This final is a huge opportunity for us. ""Looking back to where we were in 2015 compared to now it's such a dramatic improvement and everyone in the dressing room deserves a huge amount of credit. ""Making the most of it would be brilliant but getting to the final alone is awesome."" Man of the match Chris Woakes, who took 3-20 in eight overs:""I'm pretty speechless. It was an incredible performance from the whole team. ""It started with the bowling performance and then the way they knocked that off was outstanding. ""There were some nerves around this morning but that's natural going into a semi-final. ""The way we produced the goods just showed how good we are and where we are at as a team."" This video can not be played Australia 14-3 as England make dream start Former England captain Alastair Cook on Test Match Special:""I can't believe I have just watched that. ""You always think there will be a twist in the tail but there was no twist. England were so good.""

This video can not be played Archer dismisses Finch for a golden duck Australia captain Aaron Finch:""We were totally outplayed today. The way they set the tone with the ball in those first 10 overs was a huge part in the game.

Flooded New Orleans braces for possible hurricane,"This video can not be played New Orleans has already been hit by flooding Tropical Storm Barry, which is currently moving over the Gulf of Mexico, is likely to develop into a hurricane. It is forecast to hit the US city of New Orleans, which has already seen thunderstorms and flash floods. A state of emergency is in effect and residents in some low-lying areas have been asked to evacuate. The Mississippi river could come dangerously close to overtopping banks shielding the city, officials warn. It could rise as high as 20ft (6m) above sea level, they say, potentially exceeding the 20-25ft levees which protect the river from overflowing. ""We're confident the levees themselves are in good shape. The big focus is height,"" Ricky Boyett, a spokesman for the US Army Corps of Engineers, which maintains the fortifications, told AP news agency. A waterspout was spotted over Lake Pontchartrain Heavy rains have already brought flash flooding to the city On Wednesday morning, the New Orleans metro area was hit by as much as eight inches of rain over a three-hour period. Swamped streets saw rubbish bins overturned and vehicles flooded. Some parts of the city saw streets turn into lakes as deep as four feet. Kayakers were seen paddling on roadways. The National Hurricane Center said on Thursday morning that the storm was 95 miles south-east of the mouth of the Mississippi, with maximum windspeeds of 40mph (64 km/hr). This video can not be played Tomasz Schafernaker takes a look at the formation of Cape Verde-type hurricanes and where their energy comes from. When winds hit 74mph it will be declared a hurricane, which is predicted to happen before it makes landfall in the delta of the Mississippi River on Friday. The storm is predicted to dump 10-15 inches of rain on Friday and Saturday along the Louisiana coast and parts of Texas. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Residents have been warned to stock up on drinking water and non-perishable food, as well as other emergency supplies. Plaquemines Parish, south of New Orleans, has ordered residents to evacuate. Vermilion Parish, to the west of the city, has asked some people living in low-lying areas to consider moving to higher ground. Residents are asked to keep drains clear so water can quickly pass through Storm surges are expected to see rivers and tides crest at levels far higher than average, officials warn. The primary danger is in the amount of water from surges and rainfall rather than wind damage, emergency responders say. The danger has been compounded by the abnormally high levels of water in the Mississippi, which is swollen from months of above-average rainfall. Tropical Storm Barry is currently ""moving very slowly to the west at 5mph""  the National Weather Center warned in an advisory on Thursday. It said the storm could produce tornados along southern portions of Louisiana and Mississippi. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Officials warn that even if the storm does not form into a hurricane, heavy rain could still create dangerous conditions lasting for days. ""No one should take this storm lightly,"" said Governor John Bel Edwards as he declared a state of emergency. ""As we know all too well in Louisiana, low intensity does not necessarily mean low impact."" New Orleans Mayor Latoya Cantrell said the city's anti-flood water pumps are working at ""optimal capacity"", but cautioned: ""We cannot pump our way out of the water levels and the waterfalls that are expected to hit the city of New Orleans."" She, and other city officials, asked people to bring in their rubbish bins and clear yards and streets in order to prevent debris from choking street drains and gutters or becoming airborne ""projectiles"". New Orleans Police Superintendent Shaun Ferguson said officers were ""all hands of deck"" and said all leave had been cancelled for police officers. He asked people to remain in their homes and not to attempt to drive their car through standing water due to the danger of being swept away or stranded. Fire officials warn that in the event of a power outage, residents should be careful not to overheat or mismanage electrical generators, and should refrain from using candles unless necessary due to the danger of sparking a fire. The National Guard has sent a large contingent to New Orleans to assist in rescue and recovery operations, and to transport equipment into the city. How do hurricanes form?

Marks & Spencer ousts fashion boss,"Marks & Spencer has ousted its clothing and home boss, Jill McDonald, who spent two years attempting to turn around the struggling division. Chief executive Steve Rowe will take over from Ms McDonald in the short term. He said the firm needed to ""address long-standing issues in our clothing and home supply chain around availability and flow of product"". Ms McDonald had previous senior roles at Halfords and McDonald's. ""Her lack of skill in clothes buying and supply chain appears to be the problem. But then the problem existed before she joined, didn't it?"" Global Data retail analystMaureen Hinton tweeted,external. Ms McDonald joined Marks & Spencer in autumn 2017 as it began a major turnaround plan, which has seen it shut stores and revamp its management. Jill McDonald's appointment came as a surprise. The former boss of Halfords had been parachuted into one of the trickiest jobs in retail with no fashion experience. We were told she'd been hired for her ""first-class customer knowledge"" and experience in running high-achieving teams. In the end, that wasn't enough. Marks & Spencer still hasn't fixed the basics when it comes to its all-important clothing business. Availability, for instance, is still a big issue. It's clear she hasn't been able to move quickly enough to tackle its long-running problems. Now chief executive Steve Rowe has taken direct control of this division again until a successor can be found. Despite the turnaround plan, profits have continued to fall, and Mr Rowe said this week that it had been a ""troubled year"" for the company's vital clothing and home division. At the firm's annual general meeting on Tuesday he listed major failures, including not buying enough jeans for a February promotion. ""That led to us having some of the worst availability in casual trousers I've seen in my life,"" he said. M&S sales and profits fall amid shake-up Lady Gaga in exclusive Amazon deal to launch beauty range Superdry founder promises revival after Â£85m loss However, he also said clothing ranges had improved in terms of fit, style and value. ""Further work [is needed] on getting size ratios correct, making sure we reduce the number of lines we're running [and] concentrating on the big lines that we're famous for across the UK,"" he added. Mr Rowe said Marks & Spencer had developed a strong team in clothing, praising Jill Stanton, women's and children's director, and Wes Taylor, the menswear director, who were both hired in 2018. However, he did not mention Ms McDonald's name. After several failed re-launches over the past decade, the 135-year-old M&S is facing challenges to its clothing business from fast-fashion chains such as Zara and H&M. In May M&S reported its third drop in annual profit in a row, and a 1.6% fall in clothing and home like-for-like sales. Its shares are down 30% from a year ago. AnnouncingMs McDonald's departure from the business,external, Mr Rowe said she had ""recruited a talented team, improved the quality and style of product and set a clear direction for the business to attract a younger family age customer"". Ms Hinton told the BBC that Marks & Spencer clothing had been losing market share for years, so whoever takes the division on next ""faces a real challenge"". ""Even those before [Ms McDonald] with a strong clothing background could not attract back shoppers who have deserted it for other retailers and brands that have far more enticing ranges and stores,"" she said. Marks & Spencer's management knew Ms McDonald had no fashion experience when they hired her, Ms Hinton said. ""You would have thought there would be the experience and support in the business to make up for her lack in this area,"" Ms Hinton said. ""But it seems not - which is even more worrying as these are described by Marks & Spencer as longstanding issues,"" she added.

The hosts will have the chance to lift the trophy for the first time when they meet New Zealand at Lord's on Sunday. A first win in a World Cup knockout match since 1992 was secured over the defending champions on a day that will live long in the memory, justifiably alongside anything from the 2005 Ashes or the 2010-11 tour of Australia.

Marks & Spencer ousts fashion bossJill McDonald will leave the company after criticism over the availability of fashion products.,"Marks & Spencer has ousted its clothing and home boss, Jill McDonald, who spent two years attempting to turn around the struggling division. Chief executive Steve Rowe will take over from Ms McDonald in the short term. He said the firm needed to ""address long-standing issues in our clothing and home supply chain around availability and flow of product"". Ms McDonald had previous senior roles at Halfords and McDonald's. ""Her lack of skill in clothes buying and supply chain appears to be the problem. But then the problem existed before she joined, didn't it?"" Global Data retail analystMaureen Hinton tweeted,external. Ms McDonald joined Marks & Spencer in autumn 2017 as it began a major turnaround plan, which has seen it shut stores and revamp its management. Jill McDonald's appointment came as a surprise. The former boss of Halfords had been parachuted into one of the trickiest jobs in retail with no fashion experience. We were told she'd been hired for her ""first-class customer knowledge"" and experience in running high-achieving teams. In the end, that wasn't enough. Marks & Spencer still hasn't fixed the basics when it comes to its all-important clothing business. Availability, for instance, is still a big issue. It's clear she hasn't been able to move quickly enough to tackle its long-running problems. Now chief executive Steve Rowe has taken direct control of this division again until a successor can be found. Despite the turnaround plan, profits have continued to fall, and Mr Rowe said this week that it had been a ""troubled year"" for the company's vital clothing and home division. At the firm's annual general meeting on Tuesday he listed major failures, including not buying enough jeans for a February promotion. ""That led to us having some of the worst availability in casual trousers I've seen in my life,"" he said. M&S sales and profits fall amid shake-up Lady Gaga in exclusive Amazon deal to launch beauty range Superdry founder promises revival after Â£85m loss However, he also said clothing ranges had improved in terms of fit, style and value. ""Further work [is needed] on getting size ratios correct, making sure we reduce the number of lines we're running [and] concentrating on the big lines that we're famous for across the UK,"" he added. Mr Rowe said Marks & Spencer had developed a strong team in clothing, praising Jill Stanton, women's and children's director, and Wes Taylor, the menswear director, who were both hired in 2018. However, he did not mention Ms McDonald's name. After several failed re-launches over the past decade, the 135-year-old M&S is facing challenges to its clothing business from fast-fashion chains such as Zara and H&M. In May M&S reported its third drop in annual profit in a row, and a 1.6% fall in clothing and home like-for-like sales. Its shares are down 30% from a year ago. AnnouncingMs McDonald's departure from the business,external, Mr Rowe said she had ""recruited a talented team, improved the quality and style of product and set a clear direction for the business to attract a younger family age customer"". Ms Hinton told the BBC that Marks & Spencer clothing had been losing market share for years, so whoever takes the division on next ""faces a real challenge"". ""Even those before [Ms McDonald] with a strong clothing background could not attract back shoppers who have deserted it for other retailers and brands that have far more enticing ranges and stores,"" she said. Marks & Spencer's management knew Ms McDonald had no fashion experience when they hired her, Ms Hinton said. ""You would have thought there would be the experience and support in the business to make up for her lack in this area,"" Ms Hinton said. ""But it seems not - which is even more worrying as these are described by Marks & Spencer as longstanding issues,"" she added.

Threat level raised for UK ships in Iranian waters,"HMS Montrose was shadowing a British tanker as it moved into the Strait of Hormuz The UK has raised the threat to British shipping in Iranian waters in the Gulf to the highest level - where the risk of attack is ""critical"". The step was taken on Tuesday, amid growing tensions in the region. On Wednesday, Iranian boats tried to impede a British oil tanker in the region - before being driven off by a Royal Navy ship, the MoD said. Iran had threatened to retaliatefor the seizure of one of its own tankers, but denied any attempted seizure. The Department for Transport said it regularly provided security advice to UK ships in high-risk areas. The threat level means British ships are advised not to enter Iranian waters, BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said. Gulf crisis: Are we heading for a new tanker war? Iranian official threatens to seize British tanker Why does the Strait of Hormuz matter? Boats believed to belong to Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps (IRGC) approached the British Heritage tanker and tried to bring it to a halt as it was moving out of the Gulf into the Strait of Hormuz. HMS Montrose, a British frigate shadowing the BP-owned tanker, was forced to move between the three boats and the ship, a Ministry of Defence spokesman said. He described the Iranians' actions as ""contrary to international law"". Guns on HMS Montrose were trained on the Iranian boats as they were ordered to back off, US media reported. The boats heeded the warning and no shots were fired. Last week, British Royal Marines helped the authorities in Gibraltarseize an Iranian tankerbecause of evidence it was carrying oil to Syria in breach of EU sanctions. A spokesman for the Royal Gibraltar Police said they had arrested the captain and chief officer of the Iranian tanker on Thursday, on suspicion of breaching EU sanctions, but neither had been charged. The BBC has been told British Heritage was near the island of Abu Musa when it was approached by the Iranian boats. Although Abu Musa is in disputed territorial waters, HMS Montrose remained in international waters throughout. Defence Secretary Penny Mordaunt said the government was concerned by the incident and urged the Iranian authorities to ""de-escalate the situation"". Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt added the UK would monitor the situation ""very carefully"". Prime Minister Theresa May's official spokesman said the government was ""committed to maintaining freedom of navigation in accordance with international law"". A spokesperson for the US State Department condemned Iran's actions and said that Washington would continue to work closely with the UK. Morgan Ortagus said: ""We commend the actions of the Royal Navy in ensuring freedom of navigation and the free flow of commerce through this critically important waterway."" Commander of the US Fifth Fleet Vice Adm Jim Malloy described the incident as ""unlawful harassment"" and said the fleet would continue to work closely with the Royal Navy to defend ""the free flow of commerce"". The navy of Iran's Islamic Revolution Guard Corps has denied claims it tried to seize the tanker, Iranian news agencies reported. IRGC's navy said there had been no confrontation with any foreign vessels in the past 24 hours. Iranian foreign minister Mohammad Javad Zarif said the UK made the claims ""for creating tension"". ""These claims have no value,"" Mr Zarif added, according to the Fars news agency. Two tankers were attacked in the Strait of Hormuz in June The relationship between the UK and Iran has become increasingly strained, after Britain said the Iranian regime was""almost certainly"" responsible for the attacks on two oil tankersin June. Tensions grew after the seizure of an Iranian oil tanker by authorities in Gibraltar, assisted by British Royal Marines. On Thursday an Iranian official told the BBC the seizure was ""unnecessary and non-constructive escalation by the UK"" and called for the tanker, Grace 1, to be released. An Iranian official previously saida British oil tanker should be seizedif Grace 1 was not released. British Royal Marines helped to detain the oil tanker, Grace 1, near Gibraltar earlier this month On Wednesday, Iranian President Hassan Rouhani called the UK ""scared"" and ""hopeless"" for using Royal Navy warships to shadow another British tanker in the Gulf. ""You, Britain, are the initiator of insecurity and you will realise the consequences later,"" Mr Rouhani said. This video can not be played Why does the Strait of Hormuz matter? The Royal Navy has a frigate, four minehunters and a Royal Fleet Auxiliary support ship already stationed in a permanent Naval Support Facility in the region, at Mina Salman in Bahrain. This is enough to provide reassurance, but probably not to deal with a crisis, BBC defence correspondent Jonathan Beale said. Ministers would now have to consider sending another Royal Navy ship to the region - but this could further escalate tensions with Iran, our correspondent said. Foreign Office officials said they were keeping the UK's military posture in the region under constant review but insisted they did not want to see tensions escalate. By Paul Adams, diplomatic correspondent The government says it absolutely doesn't want to get sucked into a confrontation with Iran, but cannot ignore the fact that life for British-flagged ships in the Gulf is becoming increasingly precarious. Hence the decision to raise the ship security level to its highest category - essentially a warning to British ships not to enter Iranian waters. This is an unusual but not unprecedented step, a reflection of the government's mounting concern. With limited military resources in the Gulf (one frigate and four mine countermeasures vessels), there's a limit to how much protection the Royal Navy can offer to British shipping. On any given day, there are between 15 and 30 large UK ships, including oil and gas tankers, in the Gulf, with between one and three transiting the Strait of Hormuz. The United States is looking to put together a coalition to ensure freedom of navigation through the Gulf, but has yet to share details or make requests of possible partners.  With the US and Iran locked in a bitter dispute over the future of the 2015 Iran nuclear deal, some countries who already participate in a 33-nation Combined Maritime Force, based in Bahrain, may be reluctant to get more involved. The Strait of Hormuz, through which all ships must pass to enter the Gulf, is so narrow - just 21 nautical miles (39km) at its narrowest - that Iranian and Omani territorial waters meet in the middle, BBC Security correspondent Frank Gardner says. So instead of sailing through international waters, ships must pass through Iranian or Omani territory which both extend 12 nautical miles out from their coasts. Ships do this under something called Rights of Straits Passage - part of a UN convention which gives ships free passage through the world's chokepoints like the Strait of Gibraltar and the Malacca Strait. In the case of the Strait of Hormuz, shipping is channelled through two lanes heading in opposite directions, each one two nautical miles wide. This is called the Traffic Separation Scheme. Both Iran and the US Navy deploy warships to patrol this area and have narrowly avoided confrontation on several occasions. Once ships pass through the Strait of Hormuz and enter the Gulf they need to be wary of a contested area around the islands of Abu Musa and the Greater and Lesser Tunbs. These are claimed by both Iran and the UAE but occupied solely by Iranian forces. It is understood British Heritage was not carrying cargo at the time of the incident with the Iranian boats. The vessel is registered at the port of Douglas, in the Isle of Man. The US has blamed Iran for attacks on six oil tankers in May and June. On Wednesday, the chairman of the US military's Joint Chiefs of Staffsaid it wanted to create a multi-national military coalition to safeguard waters around Iran and Yemen. However, the UK and the rest of Europe were more cautious, fearing this would escalate tensions, BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale said. It follows the Trump administration's decision to pull out of an international agreement on Tehran's nuclear programme and reinforcepunishing sanctions against Iran. Iran-US tensions: What's going on? Trumplomacy: What's the US endgame in Iran? Tehran has begun to nudge the levels of its enriched uranium beyond the limits of anuclear deal agreed with a group of world powers. Iran's ambassador to the UN Majid Takht-Ravanchi told the BBCEuropeans must do moreto compensate Tehran for economic losses inflicted by US sanctions - or Iran would continue to step up its nuclear programme.

"Benefit scam pushed on social mediaFacebook, Instagram and Snapchat pages are plugging a scam, which can leave victims owing hundreds.UK","Scam victim Sophie Vickery says comments on social media encouraged her to go ahead with the application Fraudsters are using social media to promote a scam exploiting loopholes in the welfare benefit Universal Credit. BBC News has found Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat pages plugging the scam, which can leave victims owing hundreds. Separately, the BBC has been told that the homeless, drug users and even jobless young Britons in Spain are also becoming victims. Ministers say they are working with social media sites to shut down accounts that promote fraud. A spokesperson for Facebook said: ""We do not allow fraudulent activity."" On MondayBBC News revealed that tens of millions of pounds are feared to have been stolen by fraudsters,exploiting a loophole in universal credit. While many of those scammed have been approached directly, sometimes by people claiming to be from the job centre, we have now discovered a number of social media sites are promoting the scam. Fraud victims may still have to pay money claimed Woman's benefits pocketed by online loan company Arrests in Blackburn welfare benefit theft scam On Facebook, the pages include Gov Grants Same Day, Same Day Grant, Discretionary Budgeting Grant and Same Day Grant Payment. Instagram sites include Same Day Drop UK, while Moneyinaminute is also advertising the fraud on Snapchat. Some of the sites have been operating for months, with dozens of people contacting the fraudsters asking for details on how to get the ""grants"" or ""free money"" they are offering. This page, on Instagram, uses official looking logos to reassure would-be claimants Healthcare assistant Sophie Vickery, from Plymouth, says she was encouraged to apply for one of the ""grants"" after reading Facebook comments from people who had apparently already done it and were happy. Sophie was initially cautious, but the people running the page assured her that she had nothing to lose if she went ahead. She even asked if it was a loan and not a grant ""and they said 'No. It's a government grant. You don't have to pay it back'."" When she eventually decided to go ahead she received the money within two hours. ""I got Â£1,200 and kept Â£600 and transferred the other Â£600 to them,"" she said. She had been on tax credits but found herself moved on to universal credit, which she fears will make her worse off. ""I didn't really think much of it. It wasn't until the next day when I went to view my tax credits, I knew something was really wrong."" It quickly became clear that the person who had made the claim on her behalf had invented email addresses, given false answers to security questions and said she had five children, when she only has two. She has made a fraud claim, but feels frightened and ashamed and fears she will have to pay back all the money. ""It was like I had fallen into a big black hole and I didn't know how to get out."" The scammers have, in some cases, been taking as much as Â£1,000 from victims after secretly claiming Â£1,500 from universal credit on their behalf. One bogus claim gave the names of five non-existent children as Give, Me, Some, Money, Now. The BBC has also been told that scammers are targeting homeless hostels and drug users and young British workers in Ibiza who are between jobs. Since our revelations on Monday, several officials from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) have been in touch, furious that the scam has been allowed to continue. One told us: ""Believe me when I tell you that Â£20m is nowhere near the truth. As front-line staff we have been pulling our hair out on this one for so long. ""At my job centre we are seeing between 15 and 20 false claims per day, each one scamming Â£1,500."" This Facebook page promises almost instant cash The staff member added that fraudsters came into their job centre several times a day with different people to open new claims with false information. The DWP says it is aware of the fraud and has a team of 120 people looking to identify the culprits. Some senior officials admit they are as frustrated as the front-line staff at what is happening. But another official told us: ""There is an easy fix to this debacle. ""Allow and limit online universal credit advances to their standard allowance only - to cover immediate expenses - and exclude everything else, until the claimant comes into the office for the next part of the claims process where further verification can be done as required."" In a statement, a DWP spokesman said: ""Sadly, criminals will always attempt to defraud the benefit system. ""The department is committed to bringing fraudsters to justice - last year we reclaimed more than Â£1.1bn in fraud and error and brought more than 5,000 prosecutions. ""We are already working with social media sites like Facebook to shut down accounts that promote fraud.

"Benefit scam pushed on social mediaFacebook, Instagram and Snapchat pages are plugging a scam, which can leave victims owing hundreds.","Scam victim Sophie Vickery says comments on social media encouraged her to go ahead with the application Fraudsters are using social media to promote a scam exploiting loopholes in the welfare benefit Universal Credit. BBC News has found Facebook, Instagram and Snapchat pages plugging the scam, which can leave victims owing hundreds. Separately, the BBC has been told that the homeless, drug users and even jobless young Britons in Spain are also becoming victims. Ministers say they are working with social media sites to shut down accounts that promote fraud. A spokesperson for Facebook said: ""We do not allow fraudulent activity."" On MondayBBC News revealed that tens of millions of pounds are feared to have been stolen by fraudsters,exploiting a loophole in universal credit. While many of those scammed have been approached directly, sometimes by people claiming to be from the job centre, we have now discovered a number of social media sites are promoting the scam. Fraud victims may still have to pay money claimed Woman's benefits pocketed by online loan company Arrests in Blackburn welfare benefit theft scam On Facebook, the pages include Gov Grants Same Day, Same Day Grant, Discretionary Budgeting Grant and Same Day Grant Payment. Instagram sites include Same Day Drop UK, while Moneyinaminute is also advertising the fraud on Snapchat. Some of the sites have been operating for months, with dozens of people contacting the fraudsters asking for details on how to get the ""grants"" or ""free money"" they are offering. This page, on Instagram, uses official looking logos to reassure would-be claimants Healthcare assistant Sophie Vickery, from Plymouth, says she was encouraged to apply for one of the ""grants"" after reading Facebook comments from people who had apparently already done it and were happy. Sophie was initially cautious, but the people running the page assured her that she had nothing to lose if she went ahead. She even asked if it was a loan and not a grant ""and they said 'No. It's a government grant. You don't have to pay it back'."" When she eventually decided to go ahead she received the money within two hours. ""I got Â£1,200 and kept Â£600 and transferred the other Â£600 to them,"" she said. She had been on tax credits but found herself moved on to universal credit, which she fears will make her worse off. ""I didn't really think much of it. It wasn't until the next day when I went to view my tax credits, I knew something was really wrong."" It quickly became clear that the person who had made the claim on her behalf had invented email addresses, given false answers to security questions and said she had five children, when she only has two. She has made a fraud claim, but feels frightened and ashamed and fears she will have to pay back all the money. ""It was like I had fallen into a big black hole and I didn't know how to get out."" The scammers have, in some cases, been taking as much as Â£1,000 from victims after secretly claiming Â£1,500 from universal credit on their behalf. One bogus claim gave the names of five non-existent children as Give, Me, Some, Money, Now. The BBC has also been told that scammers are targeting homeless hostels and drug users and young British workers in Ibiza who are between jobs. Since our revelations on Monday, several officials from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) have been in touch, furious that the scam has been allowed to continue. One told us: ""Believe me when I tell you that Â£20m is nowhere near the truth. As front-line staff we have been pulling our hair out on this one for so long. ""At my job centre we are seeing between 15 and 20 false claims per day, each one scamming Â£1,500."" This Facebook page promises almost instant cash The staff member added that fraudsters came into their job centre several times a day with different people to open new claims with false information. The DWP says it is aware of the fraud and has a team of 120 people looking to identify the culprits. Some senior officials admit they are as frustrated as the front-line staff at what is happening. But another official told us: ""There is an easy fix to this debacle. ""Allow and limit online universal credit advances to their standard allowance only - to cover immediate expenses - and exclude everything else, until the claimant comes into the office for the next part of the claims process where further verification can be done as required."" In a statement, a DWP spokesman said: ""Sadly, criminals will always attempt to defraud the benefit system. ""The department is committed to bringing fraudsters to justice - last year we reclaimed more than Â£1.1bn in fraud and error and brought more than 5,000 prosecutions. ""We are already working with social media sites like Facebook to shut down accounts that promote fraud. ""Our dedicated team investigates all fraudulent advance claims referred to them, which represent less than 1% of all claims. ""Where there is clear evidence that people have been scammed out of money, they will not be asked to repay it."" Have you been a victim of a scam like this or been affected by this story?

City have won their past 17 matches when facing an opponent for the first time in all competitions since a 2-1 loss to Lyon in September 2018. This is the 16th different FA Cup tie [excluding replays and second legs] between Arsenal and Manchester United - the second most in the competition's history after Everton vs Liverpool (19). Stephan Negru joined Oxford from League of Ireland side Shelbourne in 2023 Oxford United have recalled defender Stephan Negru from his season-long loan with League Two promotion challengers Salford City. Negru has made 17 league starts for Salford this season sincejoining them in July. The 22-year-old signed for Oxford from League of Ireland side Shelbourne in January 2023 and made 15 appearances in their League One promotion-winning campaign last season. He returns to Oxford in time for this weekend's FA Cup third-round tie at Exeter, with the U's having an injury doubt surrounding defender Elliott Moore. Moore suffered a groin injury in thewin at Millwallon 1 January and missed Saturday's draw at Preston North End. Meanwhile, Oxford have confirmed goalkeeper Ed McGinty has signed for League of Ireland club Shamrock Rovers on a permanent deal. The 25-year-old, who made 10 first-team appearances for the U's, had been on loan with Sligo Rovers, from whom he joined Oxford in 2022. Ruben Amorim is not going to part ways with his distinctive style of play but now it is about which of the current players are best suited for it. It is clear that some aren't but where do you start? If they can move Marcus Rashford on then that is a start. United definitely need a number nine, to me that one is obvious. Joshua Zirkzee doesn't have the attributes to fit Amorim's style and it is the same for Rasmus Hojlund because he doesn't seem to be adapting very well. The most linked striker to United is Viktor Gyokeres because he has played with Amorim at Sporting Lisbon and I do think they have to try and buy him. When Amorim left Sporting he said he wouldn't poach him in January out of respect  but maybe he will re-assess that given how much United have struggled since he joined. They also need to look at midfield and in this window and the summer get rid of some of the deadwood for fresh players. The likes of Casemiro and Christian Eriksen  should go. Kobbie Mainoo's performances need to improve because he is not at the heights of what he was last year before the Euros, but he probably needs more experience around him as he is still very young. I think we all forget that. If Bruno Fernandes is going to be their creative player then he needs security behind him to allow him to be more free. That leads into their defence which also needs to be looked at. They have triggered the extension of Harry Maguire's contract and they have Jonny Evans, but at his age he is probably not what they need anymore as Maguire has the experience. In the summer I would imagine they look for another well-established centre-back. Fara Williams was speaking to BBC Sport's Katie Stafford Manchester City's biggest mistake was getting rid of Julian Alvarez in the summer because he was a good back-up to Erling Haaland. He would have been useful given Haaland's record this season and their lack of options, so they need to replace Alvarez either in this transfer window or the summer. City might also look for another attacking midfielder as Kevin de Bruyne does not look fit or happy at the moment and Phil Foden hasn't hit the same form this season either. They need legs in midfield. They have lost Rodri and because of that they have lost their control which is what was key for them and their successes. I am not sure whether January is the right market to bring in a couple of midfielders, so that might have to wait until the summer but they need at least one now. I would say Pep Guardiola's side look old but I don't like to use that word because when I was a player and 'old' it used to upset me! Sometimes when you have lost control of a game you do look like you are treading water and the distances look a bit bigger than they normally are. But when you have an organiser like Rodri it doesn't look that bad. It is because of the lack of control that they don't look like the Manchester City we are used to seeing. Newcastle'sBruno Guimaraes has been a previous target but I am not sure if he is someone who would sit in the midfield with discipline like Rodri and get the squad ticking again. If I was Pep Guardiola I would just re-assess the squad in the summer. If you do it now then it will be more rushed and expensive. The points between City andLiverpoolare probably too far stretched in the Premier League now so I would wait and just focus on one midfielder and centre-half for January. Fara Williams was speaking to BBC Sport's Katie Stafford Simon StoneChief football news reporter Manchester City are targeting defensive pair Abdukodir Khusanov and Vitor Reis during the current transfer window. City manager Pep Guardiola wants to strengthen a squad which has been badly affected by injuries during an unprecedented downturn in fortunes under the 53-year-old. In his last transfer window as sources say City's director of football Txiki Begiristain is determined signings should fit the club's long term plan. At 20 and 18, Khusanov and Reis appear to do that. Khusanov is a central defender for French club Lens and the Uzbekistan national team. He was part of the Uzbek side that won the Under-20 Asian Cup, which brought him to the attention of clubs in the major European leagues. If he signed for City, Khusanov would become the first player from his country to play in the Premier League. Reis has broken into the famous Palmeiras side in Brazil. Already this month he has been linked with Wolves and Brighton but City believe they can sign the player. A figure of â¬40m (Â£33.5m) has been mentioned but it is not known whether this would include a number of clauses.

Benefits for the terminally ill to be reviewed,"The government will review its benefits system for the terminally ill following a damning parliamentary report. Currently, when a person's death is expected within six months they qualify for fast-tracked access to benefits. But this system was dubbed ""outdated, arbitrary and not based on clinical reality"" by the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Terminal Illness. Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd said ""vulnerable people"" should not have to suffer ""unnecessary hardship"". Charities told the APPG that the struggle to access benefits was making people's lives a ""total misery"". The six-month rule, introduced into law 30 years ago, means terminally ill people who are expected to live longer than half a year are missing out on having their benefits claims fast-tracked and simplified. The Department for Work and Pensions was criticised by the APPG for its ""overly time-consuming, demeaning and insensitive"" processes, and the report noted instances of department officials overturning and challenging clinicians' judgments. 'My dad didn't know how long he had to live' Benefits system for terminally ill 'cruel' Bucket list for man who 'isn't ready to go' Mark Hughes, 57, worked as a truck driver before being diagnosed with terminal bone cancer. He told the DWP he was unable to work, but he did not qualify to have his benefits fast-tracked - and says he was then repeatedly sent forms to fill out, some ""as long as War and Peace"". ""Anybody with a terminal illness should be fast-tracked,"" Mr Hughes told the BBC, adding, ""why can't one department be dealing with it, so you're not passed around from pillar to post"". ""Jane, my wife, has just been told her husband is going to die - and while she's got that grief, she's then having to understand reams and reams of paperwork. ""They're not a five-minute thing these papers. They can take a day, two days - and that's the last thing you want to be doing when somebody is dying."" He adds: ""The patient is only going through it once, but the family is going through it twice. They're watching their loved one die and then, once they've died, they've got to go through it all again - with more paperwork."" Ms Rudd said experiences within her own family had shown her that the last thing people nearing the end of their lives need was ""financial pressures or unnecessary assessments"". She continued: ""So that's why today I am beginning work on a fresh and honest evaluation of our benefits system, so that I can be sure that people who are nearing the end of their life get the best possible support. ""I hope that this comprehensive evaluation of how we treat those with severe conditions and terminal illnesses, will help ensure these vulnerable people get the support they need from our benefits system. ""I want people to have confidence in what we do at the DWP and no one should be suffering unnecessary hardship at this especially difficult time."" Last week's report said some doctors were struggling to accurately predict how long patients had to live - particularly those with non cancer-related conditions. It also found some doctors feared patients could be negatively impacted by learning they were expected to live less than half a year. It recommended the government scrap the six-month rule and adopt a new definition, based on incoming law in Scotland, which allows clinicians to use their own judgment to certify whether a patient is terminally ill. A majority of GPs told the Royal College of General Practitioners that they would support this change, the report said.

Detroit's abandoned jewel," by Jonathan Marcus Rick Novasky has never forgotten the day back in the 1980s when he was working a shift in the ticket office at Detroit’s Michigan Central Station. “A gentleman walked up to the ticket window with tears rolling down his cheeks,” he says. “I asked him if he needed help. The man just pointed toward the subway where everybody boarded the trains and said, ‘that's where I last saw my oldest brother back in 1943. He turned around, waved to us and then got on his train.  We never saw him again. He was killed in the Pacific.’ “That was some 30 years ago,” says Novasky, a tremor in his voice, “and it still hits me even today.” Michigan Central was once one of the grandest railway stations in the United States - the gateway to a fabulously wealthy city, dominated by the auto industry. Thousands of workers passed through the building in search of new lives - immigrants from Europe and the Middle East along with black workers, part of the “great migration” northwards, from the prejudice and poverty of the agricultural South. But Detroit’s days of lavish prosperity are long gone. The station has been closed and abandoned for more than 30 years. Its tower, like the keep of a derelict fortress, is a poignant symbol of a once-great city’s decline. Now Michigan Central is being given a new life by the industry that created Detroit’s wealth. In 2018 the Ford Motor Company bought the building and began the huge task of refurbishing it as the centrepiece of a new campus, devoted to high-tech vehicles and the future of transportation. Looming over the Corktown neighbourhood, the station is going to be transformed, along with the local area. What does the history of Michigan Central tell us about the rise, fall, and perhaps rise again of Motor City? Detroit’s new railway station opened for business in December 1913 without much fanfare. It was forced into service early because the station it was set to replace was destroyed by a fire. Michigan Central was designed in the then-popular Beaux Arts style by architects who had previously worked together on New York’s Grand Central Station. The structure was dominated by a 15-storey tower. When built, it was the tallest railway station in the world. It looked out over 18 tracks, raised above street level on a broad viaduct. Only two of those tracks remain, carrying heavy freight trains operated by Canadian Pacific. Just a short distance away the tracks from Michigan Central enter a tunnel, diving under the Detroit River into Canada. This was the route taken by many of the famous trains that connected the city with New York - the Twilight Limited, the Mercury and the Wolverine - names redolent of the golden age of rail travel. The Empire State Express connected Detroit and Cleveland with Buffalo and New York. It was inaugurated on 7 December 1941 (the same day as the bombing of Pearl Harbor - unfortunately for the New York Central Railroad’s publicity department). During World War Two the station was a hive of activity with troops arriving and departing. Former Detroit cop Ray Downing remembers seeing his older brother and uncle off at Michigan Central and meeting them whenever they came home on leave. “The station was absolutely packed,” he says. “The building was just cavernous - it meant a new world to me every time I went there.” During the early 1960s Downing was based at a police precinct just around the corner from Michigan Central. It’s the mundane nature of the job he recalls - searching for lost children, dealing with drunks and so on. Despite Detroit’s subsequent reputation for crime and violence, he remembers it fondly. “Even in a neighbourhood with a railway station, it was reasonably peaceful and law-abiding,” he says. Michigan Central was the place where workers arrived to take up new jobs in the growing automobile industry. “It was the Ellis Island of Detroit,” says labour historian and lecturer Steve Babson. 1911: An immigrant to Detroit at Michigan Central 1911: An immigrant to Detroit at Michigan Central In 1908, Henry Ford’s Piquette Avenue factory began turning out the first of the famous Model-T cars - a stripped down, simplified automobile that ushered in the era of mass motoring. Before Ford, building a motor car had been a highly skilled job for craftsmen. But Ford brought in technologies for a mass production process. Huge stamping presses to take sheet metal and turn it into the key body components of a car, small disc grinders powerful enough to remove surplus metal, and even new types of paint. “The reason the Ford Model-T was black,” says Babson, “was because it was the only paint that would dry fast enough to keep pace with the production process.” Mass production needed workers, and lots of them. They came from all over the globe. Many of them arrived from Britain, via Canada. But as early as 1907 the Detroit Board of Commerce asked the immigrant reception centre at Ellis Island in New York harbour to direct skilled workers to the city - immigrants from Italy, Poland and elsewhere in Eastern Europe. Workers came from further afield too. The city came to have one of the largest Chaldean Catholic communities outside Iraq, with the first members arriving in the 1920s. In 1906 the workforce in Detroit stood at about 80,000. By 1911 it was 175,000 and growing. Over a 30-year period there was a fivefold increase in Detroit’s population - most of that by 1925. The first step many of them made in the city was on the platform at Michigan Central. World War One saw a significant rise in the arrival of black workers from the American South, as immigration routes from Europe were closed off. Agricultural difficulties after the war only encouraged more southerners - black and white - to leave the land and seek their future in Detroit. By now Detroit was one of the wealthiest cities in the US. But the good times were brief. The crash of 1929 and the depression of the 1930s hit the city hard. Recovery was slow and sporadic. Things were only gradually improving by the late 1930s. World War Two pumped a new shot of adrenalin into Detroit’s industrial veins. Most of the auto-makers were turned over to war production and Detroit became the veritable arsenal of democracy. After the war the motor industry thought it would simply return to the way things were. The US emerged from World War Two as the world’s dominant economic power. But as Babson puts it: “The motor industry’s decline was established by its dominance.” US manufacturers concentrated on upmarket vehicles, leaving entry-level models to others. Japanese imports - initially of low quality, but quickly improving - took a larger and larger share of the market. Efforts to counter them produced some disastrous vehicles like the Chevrolet Vega, which rotted from within and the Ford Pinto, which was prone to catch fire in accidents. Detroit was changing too. In July 1967, tensions caused by racism, unemployment and police brutality ignited into five days of full-scale rioting, after a raid on a drinking club in an African-American neighbourhood. Forty-three people died - most of whom were African-American - and more than 1,000 were injured. More than 400 buildings were damaged so badly they had to be demolished. “The heaviest casualty was the city itself,” according to its first black mayor, Coleman Young. “The riot,” he said, “put Detroit on the fast track to economic desolation.” 1967: A federal soldier stands guard during the Detroit riots 1967: A federal soldier stands guard during the Detroit riots The more affluent - usually white - residents had already been moving to the suburbs. The riots accelerated this process. An estimated 22,000 people left the city in 1966. Two years later, that figure hit 80,000. Many of the areas destroyed in the rioting were never rebuilt and the scars remain visible to this day. In 1988 the dwindling railway service ended. Michigan Central was closed and abandoned. But worse was to come. The auto industry remained essential for Detroit’s future but it was not faring well. In 2009 both General Motors and Chrysler filed for bankruptcy. And just four years later - in July 2013 - the city itself went the same way, the largest municipality ever to go bankrupt in the US.

Bardelli was born in Detroit. He has always lived here, and has spent some 30 years driving past the abandoned station building wishing something could be done about it. Now he is in charge of making it happen. Working from the original plans for the station, he explains that his first task is to dry the building out and assess the scale of any damage. Richard Bardelli Richard Bardelli Looking up at the tower, he points out darker spots in the stonework that indicate water infiltration. The building has a steel frame but many winters of freezing and thawing mean some of the limestone is coming away. “We will take some of that brick out,” he says cheerily, “check the steel behind it and see what needs to be done.” Inside the station is a lofty hall lit by high steel-framed windows, the glass long since smashed. The walls of cracked plaster are sprinkled with graffiti but there is no missing the almost ecclesiastical grandeur of the place. There is a stillness, a calm, a sense of purpose, despite all the debris and scaffolding. The ground floor is divided into three main areas - a waiting room (where you can still see the outlines of the heavy wooden seats on the floor), an arcade, and the main concourse. The ticket counter is just off the arcade and, from the concourse, gates lead to subways that took passengers up to the platforms above. Bardelli is fast becoming as much architectural historian as construction engineer. He points upwards to the ceiling which comprises thousands of small tiles. This technique is called Guastavino vaulting, he says - self-supporting arches made up of layers of terracotta tiles: “There are about 20,000 of them up there. We are going to take down or re-point every piece. Luckily it’s in pretty good shape.” The scale of the restoration work is fast becoming apparent. The old station had a range of public facilities split between the sexes, reflecting the social mores of the time. “On the women’s side there was a tea room and rest room at the eastern end of the building,” Bardelli says. “At the western end there was the men’s reading room, tea room and so on. There was a large restaurant and areas for shops.” The plan is that a good part of the restored building will again be public space. For the moment, though, the building is an empty shell, stripped by vandals of anything that could be removed. Michigan Central still has a place in many Detroiters’ hearts. As soon as plans were announced to renovate the station, local people began to return fixtures and artefacts which had found their way elsewhere. In one case an anonymous caller rang to say that he had left a large station clock in an abandoned location, and that Ford needed to send somebody over to recover it quickly. That clock was once mounted on the covered roof over the carriage entrance. A clock returned anonymously to Michigan Central A clock returned anonymously to Michigan Central This prompted the company to put out a call for any other objects or artefacts to be returned - no questions asked. In came a variety of items - door plates, elevator call buttons, office lamps, ornate staircase finials, even old fire extinguishers. Every item that has been returned has a story. Joe Mifsud - local businessman and entrepreneur - is co-owner of a new restaurant, The Cork and Gabel on Michigan Avenue. You can see the front of the station building from its doorway. For some years he has been buying lots in the area and on one he found a huge piece of masonry. “I guessed it was a drinking fountain,” he says. “I knew it had to have come from the station. It just got moved around on a pallet for years as we bought up the rest of the property. It just shuffled from one space to the next.” When he heard about Ford’s purchase of the building he rang them and they said: “Please, bring it over.” Mifsud is a local, a third-generation Corktown native. He remembers “skating” on the station's highly polished floor as a boy. Mifsud began developing businesses in the area some 13 years ago. He accepts that at the time things were pretty grim. When he purchased his restaurant building (it used to be an old doughnut factory), it was abandoned with no doors and windows. So what prompted him to take the risk?  “We're on a major artery, Michigan Avenue,” he says. “It's close to downtown Detroit. I just thought it had to come back. And we're so close to the heart of the city that it would come our way. And thank goodness it did.” Michigan Central illuminated for Winter Fest celebrations, 2018 Michigan Central illuminated for Winter Fest celebrations, 2018 Bill Ford, the executive chairman of Ford Motor Company and great-grandson of Henry Ford, remembers the Detroit of his youth: “Everything I did... was in the city - my barber, my doctor, my dentist, [where] I bought my clothes. The city was where everything happened.” Re-purposing the station is in one sense going back to his famous family’s roots. Corktown, not surprisingly, derives its name from the fact that it was settled by Irish immigrants from County Cork. That too is where the Ford family has its origins. Bill Ford Bill Ford But this is a move driven by judgement as much as sentiment. “The decay of the train station was a symbol for the decay of Detroit,” says Ford. “I would drive by this train station on a very frequent basis and it always really bothered me - there was so much that was positive starting to take place in the city. But this was always sitting there as a reminder, the past was always looming.” He was determined that if there was ever a chance to do something with the building he would step in. And the profound changes in the automobile industry provided just such an opportunity. Fewer young people are getting driving licences, patterns of car ownership are changing. Not far ahead the prospect of autonomous vehicles and electric propulsion looms large. “Our future was looking very different,” he says. “Ford needed to attract talent from all around the world.” He devised a plan to purchase not just Michigan Central, but other buildings in the Corktown area, and build what he calls “a mobility campus”. “We are going to create a neighbourhood where we can test out a lot of the new ideas.” The aim is to develop an attractive environment akin to the high-tech campuses of Silicon Valley in California. One of Detroit’s leading industry analysts, Michelle Krebs, agrees with Ford that the company’s future cannot simply be in building cars: “In the future the money will be made in the services around the car.” However, she says that this brings fresh challenges for Ford and its competitors: “Before, they all competed against each other. Now they're competing not just against each other but also against technology companies.” The new campus will employ 2,500 Ford workers along with a similar number from partner companies. Throughout Corktown there could be several thousand more jobs linked to the project in one way or another. Pamela Alexander, the director of community development for Ford’s philanthropic arm, the Motor Company Fund, is keen to stress what she says is the company’s long-standing commitment to the area. A graffiti artist at Ford's launch ceremony for the Michigan Central project A graffiti artist at Ford's launch ceremony for the Michigan Central project It is investing in training and affordable housing. A newsletter goes out to all local households. “Ford was listening to the community,” she says, “even before the announcement of the terminal project.” Ford mounted a Halloween party at the station last year (this is a city, she points out, where in many areas it is not safe for kids to go out and trick-or-treat). There was also a Winter Fest over nine evenings with refreshments and a light show on the station building. Ford is making all the right noises. But change inevitably means disruption and there are all sorts of concerns among the local community. Tricia Talley is is uneasy with the phrase “rebirth of Detroit”. There were always people here, she says. “The ‘rebirth’ is mainly about white people coming back to the centre of the city.” As president of the North Corktown Neighbourhood Association (NCNA), she was initially excited at news of the Ford project. But she remains concerned that not enough jobs will go to Corktown residents - “the people who stayed and weathered the storm”. Talley first came to the area in 2006. At that time much of North Corktown was empty. As gentrification slowly got under way, young white people began moving in - “urban pioneers” as she calls them, just a touch ironically. “We even got bike lanes,” she says. Tricia Talley and Rhonda Greene, Corktown residents Tricia Talley and Rhonda Greene, Corktown residents The trendy new hotel restaurant in which she’s sitting is itself a small example of the change in the neighbourhood. A decade or so ago the building was a dive, renting out rooms in three-hour blocks and infamously providing vending machines dispensing lighters, condoms and women’s underwear. Sitting with Talley is Rhonda Greene, another Corktown resident on the NCNA’s board. She says she also has mixed feelings about the project. “If that building comes back to life,” she tells me, “then the Corktown area too will come back to life. We wanted the city’s attention,” she says. However, she worries that Ford’s “louder voice” may drown out those of local people. Both women agree that there must be no false dawn. But as Greene notes sadly, “we are used to being disappointed.” House prices are certainly going up. Local estate agents Ryan Cooley and Lauren Bruyninga have been watching the changes to the area for more than a decade. Cooley says about 80% of their business is now residential property. In 2008 the average sales price was about $35,000. In 2018, it was $250,000. Bruyninga says when she first came to Detroit, “people would come downtown to work and then five o’clock would happen, and the whole city would be dead - I mean desolate, scary, quiet. But now you see the downtown is developed - it’s pushing to the outskirts - and hopefully it will push out to the neighbourhoods as well.” Local councillor Raquel Castaneda-Lopez represents District 6, encompassing Corktown, North Corktown and the surrounding neighbourhoods that will be affected by the Ford project. Councillor Raquel Castaneda-Lopez is worried locals will be priced out of Corktown Councillor Raquel Castaneda-Lopez is worried locals will be priced out of Corktown Castaneda-Lopez was happy that Ford bought Michigan Central because the property had been blighted for many years. But she worries about over-reliance upon Ford. “Part of the reason Detroit is in the condition it is,” she explains, “is because we depended solely upon the automobile industry to build us up. And then as the auto industry moved out and left the city there was a lot of decay.” She resists the notion that Ford is “saving” Corktown, pointing to the small-business owners on Michigan Avenue’s commercial quarter who stuck it out and contributed to the area’s resurgence. “Ultimately,” she says, “it's the small businesses that tend to employ locally and have a more significant impact on local economies.” Ford is receiving large tax incentives from Detroit in return for investing locally. The figures are complicated but some estimates say the company is getting an initial package of tax breaks of up to $207m, in return for investing $738m across its five Corktown sites. “We really are doing this for our future,” Bill Ford insists. “This isn't a tax play. If we had never showed up those revenues would never have come to these neighbourhoods. Anywhere we go and build a facility, the local community works with us. That's true in America. That's true anywhere in the world.” Ten minutes by car from Michigan Central, the Detroit Institute of Arts provides a similar parable of the city’s rise and fall. Housed in a grand building on Woodward Avenue (just across the road from an equally grand public library), the institute, like Michigan Central, evokes the high point of Detroit’s success. It has one of the most extensive art collections in the United States - one that would grace any capital city in the world. But then at one time Detroit was richer than any capital city. Highlights of the institute include a variety of Dutch Masters including a Rembrandt. But one of its most famous treasures is inextricably linked to the auto industry. The Detroit Industry Murals were painted between 1932 and 1933 by the great Mexican artist Diego Rivera (husband to the artist Frida Kahlo). These massive artworks were commissioned directly for the institute, and they depict car manufacturing at the Ford company’s River Rouge plant. There are two main frescoes on the north and south walls. One shows the assembly of V8 engine blocks, while the other depicts completed transmissions rolling along the production line. Henry Ford’s son, Edsel (Bill’s grandfather) contributed $20,000 to help defray the costs of the project. He is depicted at the right-hand side of one of the panels. Edsel Ford is featured (second from right) in this detail from Rivera's mural Edsel Ford is featured (second from right) in this detail from Rivera's mural Few cities in modern times have seen a downturn in fortune as spectacular as Detroit. Urban blight and decay are not unusual. But the scale and scope of what happened to Detroit are. Well within living memory, the population of the city has collapsed. From more than 1.8 million in 1950, it stood at a little over 700,000 by 2010. And with the collapse in population came a collapse in local tax income. Increasingly the city could not pay for itself or the basic services that its remaining residents needed. In 2013 the emergency manager appointed to run the city’s affairs was looking for assets that could be liquidated, and floated the idea of selling many of the institute’s artworks - “just like the furniture out of an office building”, according to local art historian Jeffrey Abt. Eventually, what Abt describes as a “grand bargain” was reached and the 2,800 artworks earmarked for sale (worth a total of between $750-$800m) remain in the institute’s collection. While a price can be put on artworks, it is almost impossible to calculate the human cost of Detroit’s decline. It was in effect depopulated. Tens of thousands of buildings were empty and abandoned. Detroit became a city with a failing heart and a poor, mainly black, population. It was surrounded by more affluent, often white suburbs, with little interest in the goings-on at City Hall. This was the city I first visited some 20 years ago. Downtown was bleak and forbidding. It is the only city I have ever seen with abandoned skyscrapers. At night it was dark and dangerous. In the neighbourhoods surrounding the city, many streets looked like war-zones. Every third or fourth house was either burnt out or an empty lot. Those that remained were dilapidated and forlorn. Whole blocks of streets had been abandoned, and grass was growing through the foundations creating urban prairies. There wasn’t much in the way of a tourist industry in Detroit. Visitors might come to see the home of the Motown music phenomenon. Otherwise, it seemed that there was only abandonment and ruins - grand names from the past such as the once swanky Book-Cadillac Hotel, or slowly collapsing factories like the Packard Plant and the Fisher Body Plant 21. Lowell Boileau - artist, enthusiast for Detroit’s future and my guide on successive visits to the city, established a website to commemorate many of these great old buildings. He called it The Fabulous Ruins of Detroit. Over them all - sentinel-like - stood the crumbling edifice of Michigan Central. Boileau says he was delighted by Ford’s purchase of the station. Downtown Detroit had been undergoing a resurgence, but there was still “this huge ruin of a building, made worse by the fact that there were no other buildings around it - a symbol of the city’s failure”. Lowell Boileau Lowell Boileau Detroit was a city beyond crisis. Even today there are still vast numbers of empty lots and abandoned areas. Lowell is sanguine about the city’s long-term prospects. “I don't know what the future will hold,” he says. “But this is the pounding heart of Detroit, the historical centre of the city and you have to have a healthy heart before those limbs out there can prosper. “Visitors now come to Detroit and suddenly they are not seeing abandoned buildings in the centre of the city. They're seeing a vibrant happening place, with these beautiful 1920s-era buildings glistening again.” Boileau rhapsodises about his home city: “I know that Jerusalem has been destroyed many times. I know Rome has been sacked. I know cities go through cycles and Detroit has similarly gone through that. “I know enough history,” he says, “to know that nothing is final. It will go through its ups and downs.” When the final train left and the station closed its doors in 1988 the local newspaper - the Detroit Free Press - tried to put this sombre moment into a wider context. “The shutdown of Michigan Central,” it declared, “should be the occasion of serious reflection about what we once were; what we have lost; and what, given sufficient will, we could regain.” So, might the trains ever come back to Michigan Central one day? Bill Ford does not rule this out completely. “Right now, the tracks stop about a mile short of the station. But yes, I would love the trains to come back. “Obviously,” he adds, “that's not within Ford's control but we're already starting to talk to some of the regional transportation people about just that.

"Benefits for the terminally ill to be reviewedCharities say the struggle to access benefits is making people's lives a ""total misery"".","The government will review its benefits system for the terminally ill following a damning parliamentary report. Currently, when a person's death is expected within six months they qualify for fast-tracked access to benefits. But this system was dubbed ""outdated, arbitrary and not based on clinical reality"" by the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Terminal Illness. Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd said ""vulnerable people"" should not have to suffer ""unnecessary hardship"". Charities told the APPG that the struggle to access benefits was making people's lives a ""total misery"". The six-month rule, introduced into law 30 years ago, means terminally ill people who are expected to live longer than half a year are missing out on having their benefits claims fast-tracked and simplified. The Department for Work and Pensions was criticised by the APPG for its ""overly time-consuming, demeaning and insensitive"" processes, and the report noted instances of department officials overturning and challenging clinicians' judgments.

He adds: ""The patient is only going through it once, but the family is going through it twice. They're watching their loved one die and then, once they've died, they've got to go through it all again - with more paperwork."" Ms Rudd said experiences within her own family had shown her that the last thing people nearing the end of their lives need was ""financial pressures or unnecessary assessments"". She continued: ""So that's why today I am beginning work on a fresh and honest evaluation of our benefits system, so that I can be sure that people who are nearing the end of their life get the best possible support. ""I hope that this comprehensive evaluation of how we treat those with severe conditions and terminal illnesses, will help ensure these vulnerable people get the support they need from our benefits system. ""I want people to have confidence in what we do at the DWP and no one should be suffering unnecessary hardship at this especially difficult time."" Last week's report said some doctors were struggling to accurately predict how long patients had to live - particularly those with non cancer-related conditions. It also found some doctors feared patients could be negatively impacted by learning they were expected to live less than half a year. It recommended the government scrap the six-month rule and adopt a new definition, based on incoming law in Scotland, which allows clinicians to use their own judgment to certify whether a patient is terminally ill. A majority of GPs told the Royal College of General Practitioners that they would support this change, the report said.

UK 'prepared for Brexit and trade war fall-out',"The Bank of England says the UK banking system is still resilient to the financial impact of a worst-case disorderly Brexit. The comment came in its regular health check on the banks, the Financial Stability Report. The Bank said ""the perceived likelihood of no-deal Brexit has increased since the start of the year"". It said that ""material risks"" of economic disruption from such a scenario remain. However, there had been ""some improvement in the preparedness of the UK economy for no-deal Brexit"". Since last year, UK banks have been forced to hold back more capital, and demonstrate easy access to Â£1 trillion in funding (liquidity). The Bank says that such a buffer would allow the banking system to continue to lend into the economy, even if the UK were shut out of international markets for three months. This worst-case scenario stress test involves the economy shrinking by 4.7%, unemployment more than doubling to 9.5% and property prices falling by 33%. The Bank's key Financial Policy Committee went further than it has before by saying that the banking system would also be resilient to a disorderly Brexit occurring at the same time as a global trade war involving 25% tariffs on US-China trade, all global inputs and a 30% drop in the US stock market. ""Even if a protectionist-drive global slowdown were to spill over to the UK at the same time as a worst-case disorderly Brexit, the core UK banking system would be strong enough to absorb, rather than amplify, the resulting economic shocks and continue to serve UK households and businesses,"" it said. The Bank did say, though, that the impact of rising expectations of no-deal was already being seen in ""much weaker"" levels of investment in markets dependent on foreign investors - for example, commercial property. In the first quarter of this year, investment in commercial property was less than two-fifths (38%) of average levels in the past two years. For high-risk corporate borrowing (leveraged loans), it was a less than a fifth of the levels seen in 2017 and 2018. Commercial real estate prices are falling again now. The Bank also said it would be reviewing the macro-economic vulnerabilities of the economy on funding from ""open-ended"" funds, recently in the news after the problems with redemptions in Neil Woodford's fund. The Bank is also beginning work to assess the impact on financial sector of climate change risks.

France passes tax on tech firms despite US threats,"France has approved a digital services tax despite threats of retaliation by the US, which argues that it unfairly targets American tech giants. The 3% tax will be levied on sales generated in France by multinational firms like Google and Facebook. The French government has argued that such firms headquartered outside the country pay little or no tax. The US administration has ordered an inquiry into the move - which could result in retaliatory tariffs. The new tax was approved by the French senate on Thursday, a week after it was passed by the lower house, the National Assembly. Any digital company with revenue of more than â¬750m ($850m; Â£670m) - of which at least â¬25m is generated in France - would be subject to the levy. It will be retroactively applied from early 2019, and is expected to raise about â¬400m this year. The French tech tax upsetting the US Facebook quizzed in court on EU-US data transfers Trade wars, Trump tariffs and protectionism explained This video can not be played French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire criticised US threats of retaliation At present, they are able to pay little or no corporate tax in countries where they do not have a large physical presence. They declare most of their profits where they are headquartered. The European Commission estimates that on average traditional businesses face a 23% tax rate on their profits within the EU, while internet companies typically pay 8% or 9%. France has long argued that taxes should be based on digital, not just physical presence.It announced its own tax on big technology firmslast year after EU-wide efforts stalled. An EU levy would require consensus among members, but Ireland, the Czech Republic, Sweden and Finland raised objections. France's new 3% tax will be based on sales made in the country, rather than on profits. About 30 companies will pay it - mostly US groups such as Alphabet, Apple, Facebook, Amazon and Microsoft. Chinese, German, Spanish and British firms are also affected, as well as the French online advertising firm Criteo. The French government says the tax will end if a similar measure is agreed internationally. The big tech companies have argued they are complying with national and international tax laws. The Trump administration denounced the move a day before the vote. On Wednesday trade representative Robert Lighthizer said an investigation would ""determine whether it is discriminatory or unreasonable and burdens or restricts United States commerce"". US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said President Trump ordered the investigation The US inquiry could pave the way for punitive tariffs, which Mr Trump has imposed on several occasions since taking office. Previous investigations launched by Washington have covered European Union and Chinese trade practices. Defending the new tax on Thursday, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire said France was ""sovereign and decided its own tax rules"". ""I want to tell our American friends that this should be an incentive for them to accelerate even more our work to find an agreement on the international taxation of digital services,"" he added. Analysis by Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter This ""Section 301"" investigation, as it is known, has been used before as a way of eventually implementing new tariffs on countries the Trump administration feels is taking the US for a ride. If France is going to take hundreds of millions of euros from the pockets of American tech giants, the US argument might be, then why shouldn't the US earn more money from what the French do in the US? It took the same view with China and has buried itself in a trade war that has destabilised relations and has the potential to escalate even further. The digital tax is a risk for France, for it is now isolated. There had been talk of a Europe-wide tech tax, but talks fell down thanks in part to opposition from countries such as Ireland, which has benefited from being able to attract tech firms to set up their European base in the country. Other countries - such as the UK, Spain and Austria - are considering similar moves, but France is furthest along. One thing all sides agree on, however, is that in our modern, digital economy, the overhaul of how companies are taxed is long overdue. France will be hoping for one of two outcomes. Either countries follow their lead and implement their own, independent laws, limiting France's exposure. Or the move gives added energy to calls for a multilateral agreement on how digital firms should be taxed globally, putting an end to the squirreling-away of vast sums of money made by internet giants.

Airports make 'significant' progress helping disabled,"UK airports have made ""significant improvements"" in providing assistance for passengers with mobility problems, the industry regulator has said. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said that for the first time, no airports had been given a ""poor"" rating. Manchester, which was the only airport to receive ""a poor"" rating last year, was moved out of the lowest category. However, it was told to take immediate action to reverse a recent decline in performance. The CAA said that in April, when Manchester switched to a new provider of special assistance, ""the transition did not go as well as planned"". ""We have told senior management we expect immediate and effective action to be taken to reverse this recent decline in performance,"" the CAA said in its report. In response, Manchester Airport said: ""We acknowledge that there is further to go and we are investing significant additional resources to improve services for passengers in this area, regardless of their accessibility or other requirements."" In March, a woman with chronic fatigue syndromeaccused Manchester Airport of treating her like ""cargo"" and ""cattle"" following a long-haul flight. Jessica Stafford, 29, booked a special assistance service as she needed help to move through the airport. But she found the experience ""distressing"" and ""humiliating"" after being asked to walk to collect her own wheelchair. She said she was told understaffing was to blame. Jessica Stafford said at one stage she was asked to walk to collect a wheelchair The report from the CAA is its fourth annual assessment of mobility assistance. It found that a record 3.7 million passengers were assisted at 31 airports between 1 April 2018 and 31 March this year. The CAA rated the service of 14 airports as ""very good"", and 16 as ""good"". Only Manchester was classified as ""needs improvement"". ""These results show significant improvements to the experience many disabled passengers faced before our reporting began,"" said Paul Smith, consumers and markets director at the CAA. ""While it is good to see the general improvements, airports will need to continue to work hard to improve,"" it added. In a statement the disability equality charity Scope said: ""There are problems in airports, and problems on planes. Often problems happen when one company 'hands off' to another and it's unclear to the disabled passenger who is responsible. ""So while it's good to see progress from the airports, and impressive no airport is ranked failing this year, there are problems that don't fall under the CAA remit that need to be addressed.""

"Communities could snap up south of Scotland landThey are holding talks with Buccleuch over its plans to sell 25,000 acres of its Borders Estate.South ScotlandComments","Two communities have expressed an interest in buying some or all of the land Two community groups are weighing up bids for a large swathe of land in southern Scotland. Buccleuch announced its intention earlier this year to sell off about 25,000 acres of its Borders Estate. It has now confirmed that two communities have expressed an interest in buying some or all of the land. It said it was holding talks with the groups and had decided to ""create a window"" for them to consider their options up until March next year. Buccleuch had intended to put the land on the market in August but will delay that move The area involved stretches from Auchenrivock in the south to Hartsgarth in the north - much of it currently part of the group's farming operations. Buccleuch, which represents the interests of the Buccleuch family, said the land included a ""small number"" of farm tenancies which would continue under any new ownership along with blocks of forestry. The area involved also contains Langholm Moor which has been the site of two major scientific projects into moorland management. Executive chairman Benny Higgins said they had opened consultation on 30 May with a view to putting the land on the market in August if there was no registered interest. Langholm Moor was previously the site of two scientific projects looking at moorland management However, two communities have ""expressed a desire to reflect on whether or not they may wish to bid for some or all of the land that is to be sold"". Mr Higgins said they had now decided to ""create a window"" until the end of March 2020 to allow communities to develop a successful bid. If that does not happen, Buccleuch will continue with the planned marketing of the land. One of the communities involved has described it as the ""opportunity of a lifetime"". Barbara Elborn, secretary of Newcastleton and District Community Trust (NDCT), said: ""The south of Scotland has lagged well behind other parts of Scotland in acquiring land for its communities, this is now our time. ""The challenge this presents us is huge but NDCT, the wider community and our neighbours, will do our utmost to ensure that the time granted to us is used to explore the opportunity this affords us as a community."" Andrew Thin, who chairs the Scottish Land Commission, has welcomed the move. He said it was a ""great example"" of how landowners could work effectively with communities to make the most of the local land. He added: ""It is good to see the possibility of negotiated transfer open up and we encourage both the estate and the communities to make the most of this opportunity.""

Applications open for new oil and gas exploration,"The Total Culzean platform is situated about 45 miles east of Aberdeen The Oil and Gas Authority has opened up applications to explore in large areas of the North Sea and West of Shetland. There are 768 blocks or part-blocks on offer across the main producing areas of the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS). It is the 32nd round of licensing for exploratory drilling over more than 50 years, but the first since the UK committed to cutting greenhouse gas emissionsto net zero by 2050. WWF Scotland described the move as ""totally irresponsible"". But the OGA said oil and gas were still seen as part of Britain's future energy mix. ""Maximising economic recovery from the UKCS is vital to meet our energy demands and reduce reliance on imports,"" it said. Total sells four North Sea oil fields Industry data aims to encourage exploration Gas find hailed as biggest in decade WWF Scotland director Lang Banks said that opening up more areas for oil and gas exploration ""undermines other efforts to tackle the climate emergency"". He added: ""We instead need to see a just transition that enables us to harness the engineering skills currently deployed in the oil and gas industry and apply them to supporting a range of cleaner forms of energy production."" A new aspect of the latest licensing round includes co-operation on license timing with the Faroe Islands government. The authority has also provided access to a hugedata bank of information,externalfrom past drilling of thousands of wells, seismic surveys of the seabed and pipelines. Such information is valuable in increasing the chances of finding oil and gas, and reducing financial risk. An industry report in November 2018 estimated the UK has enough oil reserves to sustain productionfor the next 20 yearsand beyond. The closing date for applications is 12 November, 2019, with decisions expected to be made in the second quarter of 2020.

Violet Beauregarde actress Denise Nickerson diesThe former child star played the gum-chewing brat in 1971's Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory.,"Nickerson's character ended up turning into a huge blueberry Denise Nickerson, the former child actress who played Violet Beauregarde in the 1971 film Willy Wonka & the Chocolate Factory, has died aged 62. Nickerson's family announced the newsin a Facebook post,externalthat read: ""She's gone."" In earlier updates on social media, her family said she had pneumonia and had experienced several seizures. Nickerson - who was cast opposite Gene Wilder at the age of 13 - had previously survived a stroke in 2018. On Tuesday, her family made a GoFundMe page to help cover her medical costs. Prior to her death, they said she had been given morphine ""to keep her pain free and slow her breathing"". They wrote: ""She has random and semi-frequent seizures, but their intensity has grown far less severe as the day has progressed. Things have been relatively quiet and peaceful all day. ""We've had visitors to share fond memories, say their goodbyes, lift our spirits, and support us. We've taken turns resting, and crying, and coping, and back again."" Nickerson (far left) was cast in the movie when she was 13 Born in New York City in 1957, Nickerson's first TV roles were on the gothic US soap opera Dark Shadows as Amy Jennings and Nora Collins. In 1971, she was cast in composer John Barry's ill-fated musical Lolita, My Love before landing her signature role as gum-chewing brat Violet Beauregarde in the film adaptation of Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory.

Communities could snap up south of Scotland land,"Two communities have expressed an interest in buying some or all of the land Two community groups are weighing up bids for a large swathe of land in southern Scotland. Buccleuch announced its intention earlier this year to sell off about 25,000 acres of its Borders Estate. It has now confirmed that two communities have expressed an interest in buying some or all of the land. It said it was holding talks with the groups and had decided to ""create a window"" for them to consider their options up until March next year. Buccleuch had intended to put the land on the market in August but will delay that move The area involved stretches from Auchenrivock in the south to Hartsgarth in the north - much of it currently part of the group's farming operations. Buccleuch, which represents the interests of the Buccleuch family, said the land included a ""small number"" of farm tenancies which would continue under any new ownership along with blocks of forestry. The area involved also contains Langholm Moor which has been the site of two major scientific projects into moorland management. Executive chairman Benny Higgins said they had opened consultation on 30 May with a view to putting the land on the market in August if there was no registered interest. Langholm Moor was previously the site of two scientific projects looking at moorland management However, two communities have ""expressed a desire to reflect on whether or not they may wish to bid for some or all of the land that is to be sold"". Mr Higgins said they had now decided to ""create a window"" until the end of March 2020 to allow communities to develop a successful bid. If that does not happen, Buccleuch will continue with the planned marketing of the land. One of the communities involved has described it as the ""opportunity of a lifetime"". Barbara Elborn, secretary of Newcastleton and District Community Trust (NDCT), said: ""The south of Scotland has lagged well behind other parts of Scotland in acquiring land for its communities, this is now our time. ""The challenge this presents us is huge but NDCT, the wider community and our neighbours, will do our utmost to ensure that the time granted to us is used to explore the opportunity this affords us as a community."" Andrew Thin, who chairs the Scottish Land Commission, has welcomed the move. He said it was a ""great example"" of how landowners could work effectively with communities to make the most of the local land. He added: ""It is good to see the possibility of negotiated transfer open up and we encourage both the estate and the communities to make the most of this opportunity.""

European Vega rocket lost after lift-off,"An artist's impression of a Vega rocket carrying a satellite into space A European Vega rocket has been lost shortly after blast off, the commercial space company Arianespace says. It is the first time in 15 launches that a Vega rocket has failed. The rocket had been carrying a military satellite for the United Arab Emirates when it took off from the European spaceport in French Guiana on Wednesday evening. It is believed to have crashed into the Atlantic Ocean north of the space centre. Luce Fabreguettes, Arianespace's executive vice president of missions, said a ""major anomaly"" had occurred about two minutes after liftoff at the time of the second stage ignition. Vega rocket set for maiden voyage ""On behalf of Arianespace I wish to express our deepest apologies to our customers for the loss of their payload,"" he said. ""From the first flight data analysis, we will get in the coming hours more precise information, and we will communicate to everybody at the soonest."" Vega's failure is a reminder that you can never relax in the rocket business. The vehicle had had 14 straight successes before Wednesday night, but then something caught everyone out. Vega uses solid fuels in its lower stages. These rocket segments are normally very reliable. Once ignited, they just burn until they exhaust themselves. So, a key question facing the board of inquiry will be whether Vega's second-stage simply failed to light. The vehicle's burning first-stage appears as a bright white dot in the flight video. When it shuts down, there is nothing. Just darkness in the night sky. Space officials will move swiftly to get Vega back in service. It's an integral part of a rocket operation that guarantees Europe's access to space. Vega is about to be upgraded to use a first-stage that will also be deployed as the strap-on booster for the next-generation, heavy-lift Ariane rocket. The dual-use, and the economies of scale that come from it, should benefit both vehicles in what is an increasingly competitive market. In the same vein, Vega's 16th scheduled flight is supposed to be a demonstration designed to show the rocket can launch 42 satellites on one mission. To remain competitive, Europe's rockets must be able to lift every type of satellite payload into every conceivable type of orbit. This video can not be played ""This vehicle is run on kerosene and liquid oxygen... bring those two together and you light them, it's a fairly combustible mix"", reports Jonathan Amos The reason for the failure was not immediately known. The flight had been postponed twice because of adverse weather conditions. The rocket had beencarrying a satellite known as FalconEye1,external- the first of two that will make up the UAE's FalconEye satellite system. Vega, which made its maiden flight in 2012, was developed to allow European countries to launch small satellites into space. French-based Arianespace markets the four-stage Vega rocket system which was jointly developed by the Italian Space Agency and the European Space Agency.

Applications open for new oil and gas explorationThere are 768 blocks of sea on offer across the main North Sea producing area and West of Shetland.,"The Total Culzean platform is situated about 45 miles east of Aberdeen The Oil and Gas Authority has opened up applications to explore in large areas of the North Sea and West of Shetland. There are 768 blocks or part-blocks on offer across the main producing areas of the UK Continental Shelf (UKCS). It is the 32nd round of licensing for exploratory drilling over more than 50 years, but the first since the UK committed to cutting greenhouse gas emissionsto net zero by 2050. WWF Scotland described the move as ""totally irresponsible"". But the OGA said oil and gas were still seen as part of Britain's future energy mix. ""Maximising economic recovery from the UKCS is vital to meet our energy demands and reduce reliance on imports,"" it said. Total sells four North Sea oil fields Industry data aims to encourage exploration Gas find hailed as biggest in decade WWF Scotland director Lang Banks said that opening up more areas for oil and gas exploration ""undermines other efforts to tackle the climate emergency"". He added: ""We instead need to see a just transition that enables us to harness the engineering skills currently deployed in the oil and gas industry and apply them to supporting a range of cleaner forms of energy production."" A new aspect of the latest licensing round includes co-operation on license timing with the Faroe Islands government. The authority has also provided access to a hugedata bank of information,externalfrom past drilling of thousands of wells, seismic surveys of the seabed and pipelines. Such information is valuable in increasing the chances of finding oil and gas, and reducing financial risk. An industry report in November 2018 estimated the UK has enough oil reserves to sustain productionfor the next 20 yearsand beyond. The closing date for applications is 12 November, 2019, with decisions expected to be made in the second quarter of 2020.

Are sugary drinks causing cancer?,"Sugary drinks - including fruit juice and fizzy pop - may increase the risk of cancer, French scientists say. The link was suggested by a study,published in the British Medical Journal,external, that followed more than 100,000 people for five years. The team at UniversitÃ© Sorbonne Paris CitÃ© speculate that the impact of blood sugar levels may be to blame. However, the research is far from definitive proof and experts have called for more research. The researchers defined it as a drink with more than 5% sugar. That included fruit juice (even with no added sugar), soft drinks, sweetened milkshakes, energy drinks and tea or coffee with sugar stirred in. The team also looked at diet drinks using zero-calorie artificial sweeteners instead of sugar but found no link with cancer. Ultra-processed food linked to early death The study concluded that drinking an extra 100ml of sugary drinks a day - about two cans a week - would increase the risk of developing cancer by 18%. For every 1,000 people in the study, there were 22 cancers. So, if they all drank an extra 100ml a day, it would result in four more cancers - taking the total to 26 per 1,000 per five years, according to the researchers. ""However, this assumes that there is a genuine causal link between sugary drink intake and developing cancer and this still needs further research,"" said Dr Graham Wheeler, statistician University College London. Of the 2,193 cancers found during the study, 693 were breast cancers, 291 were prostate cancers and 166 were colorectal cancers. No - the way the study was designed means it can spot patterns in the data but cannot explain them. So, it did show that the people who drank the most (about 185ml a day) had more cancer cases than those who drank the least (less than 30ml a day). And one possible explanation is that sugary drinks are increasing cancer risk. But, alternatively, people who drink the most sugary drinks could have other unhealthy behaviours (eating more salt and calories than then rest, for example) that raise their cancer risk and the sugary drinks themselves could be irrelevant. So, the study cannot say that sugary drinks cause cancer. ""While this study doesn't offer a definitive causative answer about sugar and cancer, it does add to the overall picture of the importance of the current drive to reduce our sugar intake,"" said Dr Amelia Lake, from Teesside University. She added: ""Reducing the amount of sugar in our diet is extremely important."" Obesity is a major cause of some cancers - and excessive consumption of sugary drinks would increase the odds of putting on weight. However, the study said it was not the whole story. ""Obesity and weight gain caused by sugary-drink excessive consumption certainly played a role in the association but they did not explain the whole association,"" Dr Mathilde Touvier, one of the researchers, told BBC News. Obesity 'causes more cases of some cancers than smoking' The French researchers say the link ""was strongly driven by sugar content"" and they blame blood sugar levels. They also suggest some chemicals in the beverages, such as those that give an appealing colour, may be to blame. However, their study does not attempt to answer this question. ""I find the biological plausibility of this difficult, given there was no significant difference between groups in relation to body weight or incidence of diabetes, which is often cited as an associated risk,"" Catherine Collins, an NHS dietitian, said. Cancer Research UK: Blog on sugar and cancer,external The team at UniversitÃ© Sorbonne Paris CitÃ© say more large scale studies are needed to corroborate the findings. ""Sugary drinks are known to be associated with an increased risk of cardiovascular diseases, overweight, obesity and diabetes,"" said Dr Touvier. ""But what we show is they are also associated, maybe, with cancer risk."" They say their research is further evidence that taxing sugary drinks is a good idea. ""These data support the relevance of existing nutritional recommendations to limit sugary drink consumption, including 100% fruit juice, as well as policy actions, such as taxation and marketing restrictions targeting sugary drinks,"" their report says. The UK introduced a sugar tax in 2018, with manufacturers having to pay a levy on high-sugar drinks they produce. The British Soft Drinks Association said the study ""does not provide evidence of cause, as the authors readily admit"". Its director general, Gavin Partington, added: ""Soft drinks are safe to consume as part of a balanced diet. ""The soft drinks industry recognises it has a role to play in helping to tackle obesity, which is why we have led the way in calorie and sugar reduction.""

Branson warns pound to plummet in no-deal Brexit,"This video can not be played Branson: No-deal Brexit ""devastating for Virgin"" A no-deal Brexit would cause the pound to plummet and be worth the same as the dollar, Virgin boss Sir Richard Branson has said. This would be ""devastating"" for Virgin, and force the group to shift investment out of the UK, he said. Sir Richard also criticised the rail franchising system, saying it stifled entrepreneurs. The Department for Transport said rail firms ""clearly see an ability to be entrepreneurial"". Boris Johnson, the frontrunner in the Tory leadership race, has refused to rule out suspending parliament to force through a no-deal Brexit. But Sir Richard told the BBC that the UK crashing out of the EU without a deal would cause the pound to slump. ""The pound was at $1.53 when the referendum took place. The pound today it is at $1.22, $1.23, and the pound will collapse to parity [one for one] with the dollar if there is a hard Brexit,"" he said. Pound heads for two-year low as holidays begin UK economy returns to growth but slowdown fears persist How does Brexit affect the pound? The businessman, whose portfolio includes airlines, financial services and media companies, expects big losses for all his UK interests, saying it would be ""devastating for many Virgin companies"". ""It obviously is going to result in us spending a lot less money in Britain, and just putting all our energies into other countries"" he added. Sir Richardwarned in Decemberthat the UK would be left ""near bankrupt"" if there was a hard Brexit. He told the BBC at the time that he was ""absolutely certain"" that leaving the EU without a deal would lead to the closure of ""quite a few British businesses"". Virgin Atlantic, the group's major airline, has, according to Sir Richard, already suffered substantial loses since the UK voted to leave the EU in 2016, due to the drop in the pound against the dollar. ""All our costs are in dollars. Maintenance, plane costs, pretty well every cost is in dollars. And therefore, the bottom line hit of that was Â£100m a year, say,"" he said. A hard Brexit would mean airfreight from Europe to the US would just disappear, he says, ""so that would be another Â£100m just down the drain"". ""And I can carry on. There's an enormous list when you look at each Virgin company."" Sterling has had a tough week, falling to its lowest point in two years. It dropped below $1.25 after succumbing to political and economic pressures. Sir Richard also criticised the UK's rail franchising system. Virgin Trains, the franchise that has run on the West Coast Mainline for 22 years, will end in March next year. After a dispute with the Department for Transportover who should bear pension risk, in April, Virgin and its operating partner Stagecoach were disqualified from rebidding to operate on the line. Sir Richard said train companies should contribute to the pension deficit, but shouldn't have an open-ended risk. He added: ""I'm very disappointed for everybody who works for Virgin Trains. They've done an extraordinary job over 22 years. Sad that a great company may be coming to an end."" He said he was working on ""open access"" for Virgin Trains on the West Coast Mainline, which would let the firm operate a pared-down service. Sir Richard also said the railway franchising system was ""a real mess"", adding that it was too constrictive. ""The Department for Transport, in their wisdom, give you massive long lists of dos and don'ts, and it's very difficult to be entrepreneurial, and that's sad,"" he said. But an official from the Department for Transport said: ""We are sorry to see Virgin leave the UK rail industry having failed to put forward a compliant bid. ""Other companies have done so and the remaining bidders in current competitions clearly see an ability to be entrepreneurial on the railways. ""The recent winning bid on the East Midlands franchise accepted the pensions terms and will deliver significant benefits for passengers, transforming their journeys.""

US investigates French plan to tax tech giants,"The new tax would target huge - mostly American - technology companies US President Donald Trump has ordered an investigation into France's planned tax on tech giants - a move that could result in retaliatory tariffs. His trade representative said the US was ""very concerned"" that the tax ""unfairly targets American companies"". On Thursday the French parliament is due to approve a 3% levy on revenue made by such companies as Google and Facebook inside the country. France argues that these firms currently exploit global tax loopholes. Tech giants are able to locate their headquarters in low-tax countries where they declare most of their profits, thereby minimising their tax bill. Trade wars, Trump tariffs and protectionism explained Facebook quizzed in court on EU-US data transfers The new tax would be retrospectively applied from early 2019, and is expected to raise about â¬400m ($450m; Â£360m) this year. Any digital company with revenue of more than â¬750m - of which at least â¬25m is generated in France - would be subject to the tax. ""[Mr Trump] has directed that we investigate the effects of this legislation and determine whether it is discriminatory or unreasonable and burdens or restricts United States commerce,"" the statement from trade representative Robert Lighthizer said. The US inquiry could pave the way for punitive tariffs, which Mr Trump has imposed on several occasions since taking office. Previous investigations launched by Washington have covered European Union and Chinese trade practices. The latest inquiry was welcomed by Republican Senate Finance Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley and Senator Ron Wyden, the senior Democrat on the panel. ""The digital services tax that France and other European countries are pursuing is clearly protectionist and unfairly targets American companies in a way that will cost US jobs and harm American workers,"" they said in a joint statement. US Trade Representative Robert Lighthizer said President Trump ordered the investigation Mr Lighthizer's office will hold hearings over several weeks before issuing a final report and making recommendations. Analysis by Dave Lee, BBC North America technology reporter This ""Section 301"" investigation, as it is known, has been used before as a way of eventually implementing new tariffs on countries the Trump administration feels is taking the US for a ride. If France is going to take hundreds of millions of euros from the pockets of American tech giants, the US argument might be, then why shouldn't the US earn more money from what the French do in the US? It took the same view with China and has buried itself in a trade war that has destabilised relations and has the potential to escalate even further. The digital tax is a risk for France, for it is now isolated. There had been talk of a Europe-wide tech tax, but talks fell down thanks in part to opposition from countries such as Ireland, which has benefitted from being able to attract tech firms to set up their European base in the country. Other countries - such as the UK, Spain and Austria - are considering similar moves, but France is furthest along. One thing all sides agree on, however, is that in our modern, digital economy, the overhaul of how companies are taxed is long overdue. France will be hoping for one of two outcomes. Either countries follow their lead and implement their own, independent laws, limiting France's exposure. Or the move gives added energy to calls for a multilateral agreement on how digital firms should be taxed globally, putting an end to the squirreling-away of vast sums of money made by internet giants. The technology industry lobby group ITI welcomed the investigation but cautioned against tariffs. ""We support the US government's efforts to investigate these complex trade issues but urge it to pursue the 301 investigation in a spirit of international co-operation and without using tariffs as a remedy,"" said Jennifer McCloskey, vice-president of policy. At present, they are able to pay little or no corporate tax in countries where they do not have a large physical presence. They declare most of their profits where they are headquartered. The European Commission estimates that on average traditional businesses face a 23% tax rate on their profits within the EU, while internet companies typically pay 8% or 9%. France has long argued that taxes should be based on digital, not just physical presence.It announced its own tax on big technology firmslast year after EU-wide efforts stalled. An EU levy would require consensus among members, but Ireland, the Czech Republic, Sweden and Finland raised objections. France's new 3% tax will be based on revenue generated in the country, rather than on profits. About 30 - mostly American companies - will pay it. Chinese, German, Spanish and British firms will also be affected. The French government says the tax will end if a similar measure is agreed internationally. The big tech companies have argued they are complying with national and international tax laws. This video can not be played Trump constantly worries about the trade deficit - should we?

"Benefits for the terminally ill to be reviewedCharities say the struggle to access benefits is making people's lives a ""total misery"".UK","The government will review its benefits system for the terminally ill following a damning parliamentary report. Currently, when a person's death is expected within six months they qualify for fast-tracked access to benefits. But this system was dubbed ""outdated, arbitrary and not based on clinical reality"" by the All-Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) for Terminal Illness. Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd said ""vulnerable people"" should not have to suffer ""unnecessary hardship"". Charities told the APPG that the struggle to access benefits was making people's lives a ""total misery"". The six-month rule, introduced into law 30 years ago, means terminally ill people who are expected to live longer than half a year are missing out on having their benefits claims fast-tracked and simplified. The Department for Work and Pensions was criticised by the APPG for its ""overly time-consuming, demeaning and insensitive"" processes, and the report noted instances of department officials overturning and challenging clinicians' judgments. 'My dad didn't know how long he had to live' Benefits system for terminally ill 'cruel' Bucket list for man who 'isn't ready to go' Mark Hughes, 57, worked as a truck driver before being diagnosed with terminal bone cancer. He told the DWP he was unable to work, but he did not qualify to have his benefits fast-tracked - and says he was then repeatedly sent forms to fill out, some ""as long as War and Peace"". ""Anybody with a terminal illness should be fast-tracked,"" Mr Hughes told the BBC, adding, ""why can't one department be dealing with it, so you're not passed around from pillar to post"". ""Jane, my wife, has just been told her husband is going to die - and while she's got that grief, she's then having to understand reams and reams of paperwork. ""They're not a five-minute thing these papers. They can take a day, two days - and that's the last thing you want to be doing when somebody is dying."" He adds: ""The patient is only going through it once, but the family is going through it twice. They're watching their loved one die and then, once they've died, they've got to go through it all again - with more paperwork."" Ms Rudd said experiences within her own family had shown her that the last thing people nearing the end of their lives need was ""financial pressures or unnecessary assessments"". She continued: ""So that's why today I am beginning work on a fresh and honest evaluation of our benefits system, so that I can be sure that people who are nearing the end of their life get the best possible support. ""I hope that this comprehensive evaluation of how we treat those with severe conditions and terminal illnesses, will help ensure these vulnerable people get the support they need from our benefits system. ""I want people to have confidence in what we do at the DWP and no one should be suffering unnecessary hardship at this especially difficult time."" Last week's report said some doctors were struggling to accurately predict how long patients had to live - particularly those with non cancer-related conditions. It also found some doctors feared patients could be negatively impacted by learning they were expected to live less than half a year. It recommended the government scrap the six-month rule and adopt a new definition, based on incoming law in Scotland, which allows clinicians to use their own judgment to certify whether a patient is terminally ill. A majority of GPs told the Royal College of General Practitioners that they would support this change, the report said.

"Norwegian Air chief executive steps downBjÃ¸rn Kjos, one of the founders of the low-cost airline, stands down after 17 years in charge.Business","The chief executive and co-founder of Norwegian Air Shuttle, BjÃ¸rn Kjos, has stepped down after 17 years in charge at the airline. Under the leadership of Mr Kjos, aged 72, Norwegian Air developed from a small domestic airline into Europe's third biggest low-cost carrier. It also broke into the transatlantic market with low fares. However, the firm has struggled to make profits and has also been hit by the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max plane. Norwegian has 18 of the aircraft and on Thursday said that it did not expect them to return to service until October, later than its previous estimate of August. Boeing hit by new 737 Max problem The airline said the grounding could cost as much as 700m Norwegian kroner (Â£65m; $82m) this year, and could also undo its plan to return to profitability. The 737 Max fleet of jets was grounded after two crashes, the first a Lion Air flight which crashed into the sea off Jakarta last year, and the second an Ethiopian Airlines' flight which crashed shortly after take off from Addis Ababa in March. In total 346 people were killed. Norwegian Air has 18 Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft Norwegian's low fares have allowed it to grow rapidly. Last year it launched 35 new routes, carried more than 37 million passengers and added 2,000 staff. Its big innovation has been to operate low-cost long-haul flights between the UK and the US, which it started in 2014. It now flies to 12 US destinations from London's Gatwick airport. It has become the biggest international carrier to serve the New York City area, carrying more passengers there than British Airways, Air Canada or Lufthansa,according to figures from the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey.,external However, that growth has come at the expense of profits. The airline lost 1.45bn kroner last year, which it blamed on fuel costs, tough competition and issues with engines on its Dreamliner aircraft. In March, to shore up its finances, Norwegian raised 1.3bn kroner through a share sale and also sold some aircraft. Mr Kjos, a former fighter pilot, has pledged to slow the airline's growth and focus on profitability this year. He said that strategy was reflected in the company's second-quarter results, released earlier on Thursday, which show a net profit of 82.8m kroner. ""Norwegian's Q2 results show that we are delivering on our strategy of moving from growth to profitability,"" he said. ""Despite operational issues outside of our control, like the grounding of our 737 Max fleet, we are delivering the highest second quarter operating revenue in the history of Norwegian."" Theo Leggett, BBC international business correspondent BjÃ¸rn Kjos was one of the founders of the company. As the man in the pilot's seat since 2002, he was also the driving force behind its expansion from a tiny regional carrier to become a major player in Europe's low-cost market. He also led the move into the long-haul market, using a new generation of efficient aircraft such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner to offer cheap flights to the US, South America and even Thailand. There was no shortage of passengers, but all of this growth came at a cost.  The airline has billions of dollars' worth of debt and, over the past couple of years, has racked up hefty losses. In March, it was forced to sell new shares in order to raise hundreds of millions of pounds in new funding. It's also had to cut routes and sell some planes. The signs are that this radical action is starting to take effect, giving Mr Kjos the chance to bow out on a positive note. A new leader can now be appointed to guide the company, as it attempts to turn market share into sustainable profits. It won't be easy. As the likes of Monarch, Flybe and Air Berlin have shown, the low-cost market is a harsh environment, where only the fittest survive. Of course, there is another option. A new chief executive might be more willing than Mr Kjos to consider a takeover approach - from British Airways' parent IAG, for example. But let's not forget that the outgoing chief executive will remain a powerful influence within the company, both through the shareholding of his company, HBK Holding, but also through his new role as an adviser.

Pollution warning over car tyre and brake dust,"Dust from car brakes and tyres will still pollute city air even when the vehicle fleet has gone all-electric, a report has warned. Fragments of microplastics from tyres, road surfaces and brakes will also flow into rivers, and ultimately into the sea, government advisers say. Ministers say they want to pass standards to improve tyres and brakes. But critics say they need to go further by developing policies to lure people out of private cars. The governmentâs Air Quality Expert Group said particles from brake wear, tyre wear and road surface wear directly contribute to well over half of particle pollution from road transport. They warn: ""No legislation is currently in place specifically to limit or reduce [these] particles. ""So while legislation has driven down emissions of particles from exhausts, the non-exhaust proportion of road traffic emissions has increased."" They say the percentage of pollutants will get proportionally higher as vehicle exhausts are cleaned up more. Environment Minister ThÃ©rÃ¨se Coffey said : âThe documents published today make clear that it is not just fumes from car exhaust pipes that have a detrimental impact on human health but also the tiny particles that are released from their brakes and tyres. ""Emissions from car exhausts have been decreasing through development of cleaner technologies - and there is now a need for the car industry to find innovative ways to address the challenges of air pollution from other sources"". Climate change: UK government 'like Dad's Army' 'How do I charge an electric car without a driveway?' Water firms' protection efforts 'unacceptable' Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said: âThe industry is committed to improving air quality and has already all but eliminated particulate matter from tailpipe emissions. ""Brake, tyre and road wear is a recognised challenge as emissions from these sources are not easy to measure."" The documentchimes with a recent reportwarning that electric cars wonât offer a complete solution to mobility. It said even self-driving electric cars would produce pollution and congest the roads. The key was to reduce the use of cars by getting people on to less-polluting forms of transport, said Prof Jillian Anable, one of the authors of the report. She said: ""For many years ministers have adopted the principle of trying to meet demand by increasing road space. They need to reduce demand instead."" The UK transport department said it was spending Â£6bn on buses, walking and cycling â and Â£50bn on roads. Supporters of electric cars say the report may be flawed because when you lift your throttle foot in an electric vehicle, the car slows itself and there is less need to brake.

"European Vega rocket lost after lift-offThe rocket carrying a satellite is believed to have landed in the sea, the first failure in 15 launches.Latin America & Caribbean","An artist's impression of a Vega rocket carrying a satellite into space A European Vega rocket has been lost shortly after blast off, the commercial space company Arianespace says. It is the first time in 15 launches that a Vega rocket has failed. The rocket had been carrying a military satellite for the United Arab Emirates when it took off from the European spaceport in French Guiana on Wednesday evening. It is believed to have crashed into the Atlantic Ocean north of the space centre. Luce Fabreguettes, Arianespace's executive vice president of missions, said a ""major anomaly"" had occurred about two minutes after liftoff at the time of the second stage ignition. Vega rocket set for maiden voyage ""On behalf of Arianespace I wish to express our deepest apologies to our customers for the loss of their payload,"" he said. ""From the first flight data analysis, we will get in the coming hours more precise information, and we will communicate to everybody at the soonest."" Vega's failure is a reminder that you can never relax in the rocket business. The vehicle had had 14 straight successes before Wednesday night, but then something caught everyone out. Vega uses solid fuels in its lower stages. These rocket segments are normally very reliable. Once ignited, they just burn until they exhaust themselves. So, a key question facing the board of inquiry will be whether Vega's second-stage simply failed to light. The vehicle's burning first-stage appears as a bright white dot in the flight video. When it shuts down, there is nothing. Just darkness in the night sky. Space officials will move swiftly to get Vega back in service. It's an integral part of a rocket operation that guarantees Europe's access to space. Vega is about to be upgraded to use a first-stage that will also be deployed as the strap-on booster for the next-generation, heavy-lift Ariane rocket. The dual-use, and the economies of scale that come from it, should benefit both vehicles in what is an increasingly competitive market. In the same vein, Vega's 16th scheduled flight is supposed to be a demonstration designed to show the rocket can launch 42 satellites on one mission. To remain competitive, Europe's rockets must be able to lift every type of satellite payload into every conceivable type of orbit. This video can not be played ""This vehicle is run on kerosene and liquid oxygen... bring those two together and you light them, it's a fairly combustible mix"", reports Jonathan Amos The reason for the failure was not immediately known. The flight had been postponed twice because of adverse weather conditions. The rocket had beencarrying a satellite known as FalconEye1,external- the first of two that will make up the UAE's FalconEye satellite system. Vega, which made its maiden flight in 2012, was developed to allow European countries to launch small satellites into space.

Nickerson - who was cast opposite Gene Wilder at the age of 13 - had previously survived a stroke in 2018. On Tuesday, her family made a GoFundMe page to help cover her medical costs. Prior to her death, they said she had been given morphine ""to keep her pain free and slow her breathing"". They wrote: ""She has random and semi-frequent seizures, but their intensity has grown far less severe as the day has progressed. Things have been relatively quiet and peaceful all day.

Norwegian Air chief executive steps down,"The chief executive and co-founder of Norwegian Air Shuttle, BjÃ¸rn Kjos, has stepped down after 17 years in charge at the airline. Under the leadership of Mr Kjos, aged 72, Norwegian Air developed from a small domestic airline into Europe's third biggest low-cost carrier. It also broke into the transatlantic market with low fares. However, the firm has struggled to make profits and has also been hit by the grounding of the Boeing 737 Max plane. Norwegian has 18 of the aircraft and on Thursday said that it did not expect them to return to service until October, later than its previous estimate of August. Boeing hit by new 737 Max problem The airline said the grounding could cost as much as 700m Norwegian kroner (Â£65m; $82m) this year, and could also undo its plan to return to profitability. The 737 Max fleet of jets was grounded after two crashes, the first a Lion Air flight which crashed into the sea off Jakarta last year, and the second an Ethiopian Airlines' flight which crashed shortly after take off from Addis Ababa in March. In total 346 people were killed. Norwegian Air has 18 Boeing 737 Max 8 aircraft Norwegian's low fares have allowed it to grow rapidly. Last year it launched 35 new routes, carried more than 37 million passengers and added 2,000 staff. Its big innovation has been to operate low-cost long-haul flights between the UK and the US, which it started in 2014. It now flies to 12 US destinations from London's Gatwick airport. It has become the biggest international carrier to serve the New York City area, carrying more passengers there than British Airways, Air Canada or Lufthansa,according to figures from the Port Authority of New York & New Jersey.,external However, that growth has come at the expense of profits. The airline lost 1.45bn kroner last year, which it blamed on fuel costs, tough competition and issues with engines on its Dreamliner aircraft. In March, to shore up its finances, Norwegian raised 1.3bn kroner through a share sale and also sold some aircraft. Mr Kjos, a former fighter pilot, has pledged to slow the airline's growth and focus on profitability this year. He said that strategy was reflected in the company's second-quarter results, released earlier on Thursday, which show a net profit of 82.8m kroner. ""Norwegian's Q2 results show that we are delivering on our strategy of moving from growth to profitability,"" he said. ""Despite operational issues outside of our control, like the grounding of our 737 Max fleet, we are delivering the highest second quarter operating revenue in the history of Norwegian."" Theo Leggett, BBC international business correspondent BjÃ¸rn Kjos was one of the founders of the company. As the man in the pilot's seat since 2002, he was also the driving force behind its expansion from a tiny regional carrier to become a major player in Europe's low-cost market. He also led the move into the long-haul market, using a new generation of efficient aircraft such as the Boeing 787 Dreamliner to offer cheap flights to the US, South America and even Thailand. There was no shortage of passengers, but all of this growth came at a cost.  The airline has billions of dollars' worth of debt and, over the past couple of years, has racked up hefty losses. In March, it was forced to sell new shares in order to raise hundreds of millions of pounds in new funding. It's also had to cut routes and sell some planes. The signs are that this radical action is starting to take effect, giving Mr Kjos the chance to bow out on a positive note. A new leader can now be appointed to guide the company, as it attempts to turn market share into sustainable profits. It won't be easy. As the likes of Monarch, Flybe and Air Berlin have shown, the low-cost market is a harsh environment, where only the fittest survive. Of course, there is another option. A new chief executive might be more willing than Mr Kjos to consider a takeover approach - from British Airways' parent IAG, for example. But let's not forget that the outgoing chief executive will remain a powerful influence within the company, both through the shareholding of his company, HBK Holding, but also through his new role as an adviser.

What is a trade war and why should I worry?,"President Trump has imposed tariffs on a range of Chinese goods US President Donald Trump has shaken the foundations of global trade, slapping steep tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of goods from the EU, Canada, Mexico and China. All these countries are responding in kind, retaliating with levies on thousands of US products. This puts the world's largest economies at each other's throats. But what is a trade war? How does protectionism work? And how will it all affect you? It's what it sounds like - a trade war is when countries try to attack each other's trade with taxes and quotas. One country will raise tariffs, a type of tax, causing the other to respond, in a tit-for-tat escalation. This can hurt other nations' economies and lead to rising political tensions between them. US President Donald Trump reckons trade wars are ""good"" and easy. He's not afraid to raise tariffs. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Five reasons why trade wars aren't easy to win Four reasons Trump is hanging tough on trade It's a tax on a product made abroad. In theory, taxing items coming into the country means people are less likely to buy them as they become more expensive. The intention is that they buy cheaper local products instead - boosting your country's economy. The president has placed tariffs on billions of dollars' worth of goods from around the world, in particular China. He's imposed a 10% levy on $200bn (Â£150bn) worth of Chinese products so far. In May, he announcedplans to impose a 25% tariff on $325bn of other Chinese goods,external. Mr Trump said the $100bn gained from the tariffs will be used to buy US agricultural products, which will then be sent to ""poor and starving countries"" for ""humanitarian assistance"". He also wants to cut the trade deficit with China - a country he has accused of unfair trade practices since before he became president. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Trump made a big point on the campaign trail about cutting the country's trade deficits. He's convinced it hurts US manufacturing, and has said time and time again on the stump and on Twitter thatthe US must do more to tackle them,external. It's a term meaning the difference between how much your country buys from another country, compared with how much you sell to that country. And the US has a massive trade deficit with China. Last year,it widened by $43.6bn to $419.2bn. He wants to cut back this trade deficit, and he intends to use tariffs to do it. But while the president hates them, trade deficits are not necessarily a bad thing. Many wealthier countries have in recent decades shifted from manufacturing economies to service economies - focusing on areas like banking, travel and tourism. Reality Check: Is Trump right about US trade deficit? Services contribute to the majority of the US economy's net income. China, in contrast, doesn't export nearly as many services as it does manufactured goods. So the president's obsession with trade deficits is not always popular, with critics damning the administration's moves as protectionism. This video can not be played Trump constantly worries about the trade deficit - should we? Protectionism is trying to use restrictions such as tariffs to boost your country's industry, and shield it from foreign competition. Take Mr Trump's steel and aluminium tariffs. In May 2018, the president announceda 25% tariff on all steel imports, and 10% on aluminium. The Trump administration claims the US relies too much on other countries for its metals, and that it couldn't make enough weapons or vehicles using its own industry if a war broke out. Critics point out the US gets most of its steel from Canada and the EU - staunch US allies. In theory, taxing foreign steel and aluminium will mean US companies will buy local steel instead. The thinking is that will boost the US steel and aluminium industries, as more companies will want to buy their goods. Steel and aluminium prices will go up in the US because there will be less of these goods coming in from abroad - so the greater demand for local steel will push up the price, lifting profits for steel makers. Protectionism: What Trump has in common with Lincoln and Ferris Bueller The number of people employed in the US steel industry fell by almost 50,000 between 2000 and 2016 Sort of. US steel makers could get a boost - demand will drive new hires and bigger profits. But the US companies that need raw materials, like car and aeroplane makers, will see their costs rise. Could Trump tariffs damage US steel? Steel tariffs - what impact will they really have? That means they might have to put up the prices on their finished products. That would hurt consumers. So car prices could go up in the US. As could prices for gadgets, plane tickets and even beer - the price of making a can could rise. Making beer cans could become more pricey - and that cost could be pushed onto consumers They could affect people around the world - especially since China has retaliated. The world's second-largest economy has taxed US agricultural and industrial products, from soybeans, pork and cotton to aeroplanes, cars and steel pipes. It has also pledged to take ""necessary countermeasures"" over Trump's latest proposed tariffs. Charting the US-China trade battle How a US-China trade war could hurt us all In theory, China could also tax US tech companies like Apple. That would hit the tech giant, and it could be forced to raise its prices to compensate. A global trade war could hurt consumers around the world by making it harder for all companies to operate, forcing them to push higher prices onto their customers. Depends who you ask. Free trade is the opposite of protectionism - it means as few tariffs as possible, giving people the freedom to buy cheaper or better-made products from anywhere in the world. This is great for companies trying to cut costs, and that's helped drive prices down and boost the world economy. Free trade has led to a vast expansion of shipping and transfer of goods around the world Cars, smart phones, food, flowers - free trade has brought affordable products from around the world to your home. But at the same time, that means companies are less likely to buy local products. Why buy domestic when you can get more, cheaper, from a different country? This means the loss of jobs in wealthier countries, and uneven growth - while free trade has made some people richer, it's made others poorer. No idea. Historians have pointed out that tariffs often lead to higher costs for the consumer, while economists across the board are against the plans. The Republican Party is also overwhelmingly against Mr Trump on tariffs - they're big supporters of free trade. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

UK ambassador to US resigns in Trump leaks row,"This video can not be played Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn pay tribute to Sir Kim Darroch's service Sir Kim Darroch has resigned as UK ambassador to the US, as a row over leaked emails critical of President Trump's administration escalates. Theresa May said Sir Kim's departure was ""a matter of deep regret"" after the ambassador said it was ""impossible"" for him to continue. Tory leadership candidate Boris Johnson has faced strong criticism for failing to fully support him. President Trump said on Monday that the US would not deal with Sir Kim. The US president had branded him""a very stupid guy""after confidential emails emerged where the ambassador had called his administration ""clumsy and inept"". In a letter to the Foreign Office, Sir Kim said he wanted to end speculation about his position: ""The current situation is making it impossible for me to carry out my role as I would like."" Five things we learned from the UK ambassador spat Will Darroch row affect the Tory leadership race? Leaked Trump emails row: What do we know? Sir Kim Darroch resigns: Letter in full His resignation has prompted widespread support for Sir Kim as well as criticism of Tory frontrunner Boris Johnson. According to some Whitehall sources, Sir Kim decided to resign after Mr Johnson refused to support him during the Tory leadership debate on Tuesday night, said BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale. Mr Johnson was asked repeatedly by fellow leadership candidate Jeremy Hunt whether he would keep Sir Kim in post if he became prime minister, but refused to answer. It is understood Mr Johnson spoke to Sir Kim on the phone on Wednesday afternoon. Sources close to Mr Johnson said that he praised Sir Kim's dedication and hard work and claimed the conversation was warm and cordial. This video can not be played Mr Johnson and Mr Hunt clashed over future of UK's top diplomat in the US Following Sir Kim's resignation, Mr Johnson said he was ""a superb diplomat"" and whoever was responsible for the leak ""has done a grave disservice to our civil servants"". Asked why he was not more supportive of Sir Kim, he said it was ""wrong to drag civil servants into the political arena"". Europe Minister Sir Alan Duncan - who backs Mr Hunt in the leadership contest - said it was ""contemptible negligence"" of Mr Johnson not to support Sir Kim. ""He's basically thrown this fantastic diplomat under a bus to serve his own personal interests,"" he said. However, Sir Michael Fallon - a supporter of Mr Johnson - told BBC Newsnight Sir Kim's position became untenable ""long before the debate on Tuesday night"" and he understands the ambassador did not watch it. The backlash against Mr Johnson was ""a shabby attempt to politicise"" the affair and the leadership contender had ""made it clear he supports all our diplomats"", he said. This video can not be played Sir Alan Duncan says Boris Johnson has ""thrown our top diplomat under a bus"" Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn said,externalMr Johnson wanted a ""sweetheart trade deal"" with the US and his lack of support for Sir Kim ""shows he won't stand up to Donald Trump"". Tory MP and chairman of the Commons' foreign affairs committee Tom Tugendhatsaid in a tweet,external: ""Leaders stand up for their men. They encourage them to try and defend them when they fail."" Fellow Tory leadership candidate and Foreign Secretary Mr Hunt told the BBC Sir Kim was ""doing his job"" and his resignation was ""a black day for British diplomacy"". Mrs May said Sir Kim had had the full backing of the cabinet and he was owed an ""enormous debt of gratitude"" for his ""lifetime of service"" to the UK. Public servants should be able to give ""full and frank advice"", she added. by James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent So was it Boris Johnson what done it? Was the failure of the former foreign secretary to defend Sir Kim in last night's Tory leadership debate the crucial factor in the ambassador's decision to resign? Without Sir Kim speaking publicly on the subject, we are reliant on others to speak for him. And certainly, according to well-placed sources in Whitehall, Mr Johnson's decision to avoid criticising President Trump and his lack of support for Sir Kim was said to be the straw that broke the camel's back. If you are an embattled diplomat under fire from your host country, you need cover from London. And if that is lacking from the man tipped to be your next boss, you realise the writing is on the wall. Certainly, there is genuine anger across Westminster and Whitehall at Mr Johnson's refusal six times last night to come to the aid of our man in Washington. Mr Johnson's supporters have offered varying counter theories. Some have accused Mr Hunt's supporters of politicising the resignation. Others have insisted that the decision had been made before the debate, once Mr Trump declared he would no longer deal with Sir Kim. Realising they were on the receiving end of potentially damaging criticism, Mr Johnson's aides also let it be known that he called Sir Kim this afternoon and praised his dedication and hard work. The problem is that few in Westminster were giving much credence to these defences. In the House of Commons, Theresa May pointedly urged MPs to ""reflect on the importance of defending our values and principles, particularly when they are under pressure"". It was not hard to decipher what she was talking about. Head of the diplomatic service Sir Simon McDonald said it was the first time in his career that a head of state had refused to work with a British ambassador. He described the leak as ""malicious"" and told Sir Kim: ""You are the best of us."" Republican Senator Lindsey Graham - a supporter of President Trump - said Sir Kim had done ""an outstanding job"" as ambassador and his resignation was ""a chilling moment"". ""Ambassadors need to be able to talk to their governments without fear of being compromised,"" he said. Mr Johnson pictured with Sir Kim in 2017 while he was in Washington DC as foreign secretary In a letter to Sir Kim, Cabinet Secretary and civil service head Sir Mark Sedwill said that while he understood his reasons for resigning it was ""a matter of enormous regret that you were put in this position after a shocking betrayal of trust"". Cabinet Office Minister David Lidington said he was ""enraged"" by the situation and morale in the senior ranks of the civil service had taken ""a very heavy blow"". Former head of the civil service Lord O'Donnell told the BBC Sir Kim's successor could be chosen within two weeks - while Mrs May is still prime minister. President Trump could well wake up this morning thinking he has the power to veto who the UK has as its ambassador. It wasn't his more colourful remarks on Twitter that really ended Sir Kim's time, but Mr Trump's public announcement that he would no longer work with him. The effects of that were felt immediately. There was a banquet that Sir Kim was immediately dis-invited from. Next, he couldn't attend an event with minister Liam Fox. It was clear he was being frozen out and for an ambassador access is everything. Without it, it's impossible to do the job. More broadly, it's like this... There's never been parity in the special relationship between the UK and US - it's never been a relationship of equals but right now it seems particularly lopsided. The US knows that Britain is fairly isolated right now internationally and needs the US more than ever. Donald Trump has wielded that power mercilessly in this row. In theemails leaked to the Mail on Sunday,external, Sir Kim said: ""We don't really believe this administration is going to become substantially more normal; less dysfunctional; less unpredictable; less faction-riven; less diplomatically clumsy and inept."" The emails, dating from 2017, said rumours of ""infighting and chaos"" in the White House were mostly true. The government has opened an internal inquiry into the publication of the memos and police have beenurged to open a criminal investigation. Downing Street confirmed there had been some ""initial discussions"" with police regarding the leak and if there was concern about criminal activity they would become involved ""more formally"". Metropolitan Police Commissioner Cressida Dick said it was ""deeply worrying"" diplomatic cables had ended up in the public domain.

Five things the UK envoy row reveal about Trump,"Mr Trump had said we would ""no longer deal with"" Sir Kim Darroch With Sir Kim Darroch heading for the exit, the US portion of the leaked cable controversy draws to a close. While the British government will continue to deal with political fallout for weeks, if not months, to come, it's not too early to provide assessment from the US side of the Atlantic. Here are five things we learned. As Forrest Gump might say, power is as power does. Donald Trump as president has made a habit of stripping away norms and traditions - the veneer that cloaks the exercise of political power - and operating according to his own set of rules. There have been howls of protest from the president's political opponents and the occasional tut-tutting from members of his own party, but he has operated largely unchecked. This video can not be played Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn pay tribute to Sir Kim Darroch's service Now the president's norm-breaking has crossed the Atlantic. After standing by Sir Kim for roughly 48 hours, the British government acceded to his decision to fall on his own sword - and the leading candidate to become the next prime minister essentially held his tongue throughout. UK ambassador to US resigns in Trump leaks row Leaked Trump emails row: What do we know? Ambassadors come and go. Sometimes they are ushered from their position because of disputes with the host country. Outside of war or documented espionage, however, the drama doesn't spill into public view. Welcome to the age of undiplomatic diplomacy - and the realisation that the ""special relationship"" between the US and the UK isn't necessarily that special. ""America is respected again"". It's a common refrain from the president in speeches, tweets and off-the-cuff remarks. Mr Trump insisted during his 2016 campaign that then President Barack Obama had degraded American standing in the world, and pretty much since his inauguration he has boasted that he has restored the nation's tarnished reputation. The president frequently likes to recount how other world leaders have (privately) praised him for the job he's doing and expressed envy of American strength and prosperity. Call it his ""Make America Great Again"" promise, projected on the world stage. The trouble for the president is that Sir Kim's blunt assessment of White House dysfunction, chaos and incompetence dramatically undercut this rosy picture. Here was the representative of a close ally in confidential memos to British leaders essentially saying the emperor has no clothes. Sir Kim Darroch speaks at an event in Washington DC in October 2017 It doesn't take much imagination to picture Mr Trump's Democratic opponent throwing Sir Kim's words in the president's face during the 2020 campaign, either in advertisements or on the debate stage. And so the ambassador had to be taken out and his reputation shredded, as quickly and aggressively as possible. In the UK, the one-sided feud between Mr Trump and Sir Kim was all-day, headline-grabbing news. It roiled the British government, spilled over into the Conservative leadership contest and consumed political conversation. In the US, on the other hand, it was but a blip on the radar - just the latest instance of the president feuding with a critic, whether it's a celebrity, a political opponent or even a member of his own administration. The president wrote 21 tweets in the two-day period the Darroch conflagration burned - he took swipes at India, the federal judiciary, Democrats and the ""radical left"". He boasted about the economy and shared video clips from Fox News. The original series of attack tweets targeting Theresa May and Sir Kim merited US coverage, but the second round on day two received only an occasional mention on US cable news and nary a word on the main page of the New York Times website. Tory leadership candidate Boris Johnson pictured with Sir Kim Darroch in 2017 Sir Kim's resignation reignited interest, but only as a coda on the controversy - the inevitable denouement before the national attention moves on for good. Senator Lindsey Graham, one of the president's staunchest supporters in Congress, lamented the ambassador's departure and tweeted that he ""got a raw deal from the press"". By afternoon, attention was already turning to embattled Labour Secretary Alex Acosta and his involvement in the Jeffrey Epstein sex trafficking scandal. And the beat goes on. The British government just got a taste of Mr Trump's personnel management skills. Despite making a name for himself on reality television as the man who dramatically fires people, that's not his style - and it hasn't been for much of his professional career. Why doesn't Trump fire people to their face? The White House revolving door: Who's gone? Mr Trump doesn't fire people. He simply makes life so uncomfortable for them that they eventually leave of their own accord. If Mr Trump wanted Sir Kim out, he could have ordered him designated a ""persona non grata"" under Article 9 of the Vienna Convention on Diplomatic Relations. The UK would have been legally obligated to remove him quickly from his post. He didn't do that. Instead, the president lobbed off a series of derisive tweets, disinviting the ambassador from White House events and - whether by direction or implication - cutting off staff interaction with the man. This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""The ambassador has not served the UK well"" While we haven't seen this kind of process play out on the international stage, it's a recurring theme of his presidency. Mr Trump has publicly bashed and belittled members of his own administration, including Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and, most notably, Attorney General Jeff Sessions. He iced out former chiefs of Staff Reince Priebus and John Kelly. All eventually resigned, with their presidential pariah status obvious to anyone with a pulse. Sir Kim's decline and fall was simply more abrupt. It's no secret that there have been icy relations between the White House and the Department of State since the early days of the Trump administration. The president may view the department, which his presidential opponent Hillary Clinton headed from 2009 to 2013, as rife with critics and ideological opponents - and he may not be entirely wrong. The president's foreign policy style certainly is a jarring contrast to the way American diplomacy has traditionally conducted. President Trump wrote 21 tweets in the two-day period the Darroch conflagration burned That contrast was on full display on Tuesday, when department spokeswoman Morgan Ortagus held a public press conference - her first in more than three weeks. Under repeated questioning by reporters, Ms Ortagus insisted that relationship between the US and the UK was ""bigger than any individual; bigger than any government"". She said she couldn't speak for the president or explain his tweets, however. Those questions would have to go to the White House. Sir Kim Darroch resigns: Letter in full Will Darroch row affect the Tory leadership race? ""We will continue to deal with all accredited individuals until we get any further guidance from the White House or the president, which we will, of course, abide by the president's direction,"" she added. Presidential tweets, it seems, weren't guidance enough to change course - and beyond that, there was no guidance whatsoever. Handling an unscripted president who makes announcements without consulting or even sometimes informing staff has been a challenge for many members of the administration, in the State Department and elsewhere. They're often left wondering whether the president, either in comments or tweets, is officially changing policy or simply letting off steam. That's often led to confused or inconsistent responses on topics like immigration enforcement, a transgender ban in the military, legal strategies and US troop deployment. There's a word for that.

Pollution warning on dust from car tyres and brakes,"Dust from car brakes and tyres will still pollute city air even when the vehicle fleet has gone all-electric, a report has warned. Fragments of microplastics from tyres, road surfaces and brakes will also flow into rivers, and ultimately into the sea, government advisers say. Ministers say they want to pass standards to improve tyres and brakes. But critics say they need to go further by developing policies to lure people out of private cars. The governmentâs Air Quality Expert Group said particles from brake wear, tyre wear and road surface wear directly contribute to well over half of particle pollution from road transport. They warn: ""No legislation is currently in place specifically to limit or reduce [these] particles. ""So while legislation has driven down emissions of particles from exhausts, the non-exhaust proportion of road traffic emissions has increased."" They say the percentage of pollutants will get proportionally higher as vehicle exhausts are cleaned up more. Environment Minister ThÃ©rÃ¨se Coffey said : âThe documents published today make clear that it is not just fumes from car exhaust pipes that have a detrimental impact on human health but also the tiny particles that are released from their brakes and tyres. ""Emissions from car exhausts have been decreasing through development of cleaner technologies - and there is now a need for the car industry to find innovative ways to address the challenges of air pollution from other sources"". Climate change: UK government 'like Dad's Army' 'How do I charge an electric car without a driveway?' Water firms' protection efforts 'unacceptable' Mike Hawes, chief executive of the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders, said: âThe industry is committed to improving air quality and has already all but eliminated particulate matter from tailpipe emissions. ""Brake, tyre and road wear is a recognised challenge as emissions from these sources are not easy to measure."" The documentchimes with a recent reportwarning that electric cars wonât offer a complete solution to mobility. It said even self-driving electric cars would produce pollution and congest the roads. The key was to reduce the use of cars by getting people on to less-polluting forms of transport, said Prof Jillian Anable, one of the authors of the report. She said: ""For many years ministers have adopted the principle of trying to meet demand by increasing road space. They need to reduce demand instead."" The UK transport department said it was spending Â£6bn on buses, walking and cycling â and Â£50bn on roads. Supporters of electric cars say the report may be flawed because when you lift your throttle foot in an electric vehicle, the car slows itself and there is less need to brake.
