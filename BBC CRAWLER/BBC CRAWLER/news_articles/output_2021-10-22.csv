Six things that could affect you in the BudgetChancellor Rishi Sunak will deliver his second Budget for 2021 next week. How will it affect you?Business,"Chancellor Rishi Sunak will lay out the government's latest tax and spending plans on Wednesday 27 October. It's the government's second Budget of the year, after one in March, and will coincide with the conclusions of the 2021 Spending Review, which will give details of how government will fund public services for the next three years. Responding to the most recent public sector finance data this week, the chancellor said: ""At the Budget and Spending Review next week, I will set out how we will continue to support public services, businesses and jobs while keeping our public finances fit for the future."" What are his options? Here we look at six things to watch out for in the Budget that could affect your personal finances. Energy bills are set to rise this winter The chancellor is reportedly considering a cut to the 5% rate of value added tax on household energy bills. The move would be popular and timely against the background of soaring energy bills this winter and is something the government is now able to do because of Brexit. But the move could attract criticism as it would - in effect - mean subsidising fossil fuels ahead of the climate summit. Also, a VAT cut on domestic energy bills would cost about Â£1.5bn a year, which may just be too much for the chancellor. Extra tax on sparkling wine could be cut There are rumours the chancellor is planning to simplify the way that alcohol is taxed in the UK. The 2019 Conservative election manifesto promised to review it, so now could be the time. One suggestion is to reduce the premium on sparkling wine to the same level as still wine, which could knock 83p off a bottle of Champagne or Prosecco. ""The government should stop trying to favour certain parts of the industry, instead focusing on removing distortions and creating a simpler system of alcohol taxes targeted at socially costly drinking,"" said Kate Smith, associate director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies. The drinks levies have been in place since the 1600s and raise Â£12bn a year for the government. If you sell a second home, you'll pay capital gains tax There are rumours that the current Capital Gains Tax rates may be tinkered with. The tax is paid when people sell assets such as shares or a second home. It's been suggested that rates could be aligned more closely with income tax rates, which could mean scrapping the current tax rates of 10% and 20% (or 18% and 28% for property) and instead making everyone pay income tax rates on their gains. A report by the Office of Tax Simplification, published in November 2020, recommended that CGT rates should be increased to bring them into line with income tax. But it would be unlikely to raise significant extra amounts of tax, as it is typically paid by only about 275,000 taxpayers and raises less than Â£10bn a year. Students could be asked to repay their loans sooner There are reports that graduates may be asked to start paying back student loans earlier. The chancellor could do that by lowering the threshold at which people start repaying their student loans, a move that could save the Treasury about Â£2bn a year. Currently, English and Welsh students who enrolled at university after 2012 pay 9% of everything they earn above Â£27,295 per year. They repay the same 9% until the loan is fully repaid or until 30 years after graduating. If the threshold were reduced to Â£25,000, it would cost anyone earning more than the current limit an extra Â£206 a year, while if it were slashed to Â£20,000, it would cost an extra Â£656 a year. Ministers are rumoured to have proposed cutting the threshold to as low as Â£23,000 and giving graduates 40 years as opposed to 30 to repay their debt. A worker washing dishes could see their minimum wage rise In his March Budget, Mr Sunak announced that the National Living Wage (what the governments call the minimum wage) would increase for workers over the age of 23. Since then, the government has come under pressure to help employees further - especially as younger workers have been some of the worst hit by the economic downturn. One solution the chancellor has been reportedly looking at is to increase the National Living Wage by 5.7% to Â£9.42 per hour from its current rate of Â£8.91. That would bring it close to the Living Wage Foundation's current recommendation of Â£9.50 an hour. Pensions savers get generous tax relief The government could raise cash by cutting tax relief on pension savings for those on high salaries. But pension experts warn such a move would not be as simple as it sounds, Steven Cameron, pensions director at Aegon, said: ""A move to a flat rate of pensions tax relief, rather than the current system where relief is based on the rate of income tax paid, would be far from simple to implement."" He said it would be particularly difficult for defined-benefit schemes and could mean medium to high earners, including doctors in public sector schemes, facing big tax bills. ""Removing higher-rate relief would be a direct attack on middle Britain, leading to people who do the right thing and save for their future being hit with extra tax costs,"" said Tom Selby, head of retirement policy at AJ Bell.

"Police officers face action over Couzens messagesFive officers have cases to answer over messages sent on WhatsApp and Signal, the police watchdog says.","Sarah Everard was a talented and much-loved young woman, the judge said at Couzens' sentencing Five police officers are facing misconduct proceedings over messages sent about Sarah Everard's killer Wayne Couzens. The police watchdog said it had carried out two investigations into messages sent on WhatsApp and Signal. The officers are from four forces: the Metropolitan Police as well as Sussex, Dorset, and Avon and Somerset. If proven, the claims could further undermine people's confidence in policing, the watchdog warned. Couzens, a former Met Police officer, was given a whole life sentence for Ms Everard's murder last month. He abducted her as she walked home from a friend's house in March. The murder sparked a discussion over trust in the police, with the Met Police Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick saying she was determined to rebuild public confidence. The Independent Office for Police Conduct - which handles complaints about forces in England and Wales -said it had run two separate investigations,externalinto social media messages, and found that a total of five police officers had cases to answer. In the first investigation, it looked at claims that a probationary Met officer had shared an ""inappropriate graphic depicting violence against women"" with colleagues on WhatsApp. The IOPC said the graphic was intended to refer to Ms Everard's kidnap and murder. Although the officer was off duty at the time, they later worked at a police cordon as part of the search. The image was ""highly offensive"" and the officer will now face a misconduct meeting, the IOPC said. Another probationary officer, also from the Met, will also face a misconduct meeting for allegedly sharing the graphic and not challenging it. A misconduct meeting is for cases which could result in a final written warning. It is different to a misconduct hearing, which is for more serious cases of gross misconduct which could result in the officer being dismissed from the force. How a police officer planned Sarah Everard's murder The IOPC also carried out a second investigation, looking at claims that seven officers from different forces shared information about Couzens' prosecution in a chat on the encrypted messaging app Signal. One officer from Dorset Police was accused of sharing details of an interview given by Couzens under caution, which was not yet allowed to be reported. That officer will face a gross misconduct hearing. Two other officers - from Sussex Police, and Avon and Somerset Constabulary - were also in the Signal conversation and were accused of making unprofessional remarks about Couzens and endorsing comments made by others. The Sussex officer had a meeting this week and misconduct was not proven - although the officer was told to undergo ""the reflective practice review process"", the IOPC said. The officer from Avon and Somerset Constabulary will face a misconduct meeting in due course. Wayne Couzens admitted murder, kidnap and rape ""In April this year we warned about the unacceptable use of social media by officers based on a number of cases involving the posting of offensive and inappropriate material,"" said Sal Naseem from the IOPC. ""We wrote to the National Police Chiefs Council, asking them to remind forces and officers of their obligations under the police Code of Ethics and Standards of Professional Behaviour. ""The allegations involved in these two investigations, if proven, have the capacity to further undermine public confidence in policing. They also once more illustrate the potential consequences for officers and come at a time when policing standards and culture have never been more firmly in the spotlight."" The IOPC said it was continuing to investigate the conduct of five other officers relating to messages sent in a WhatsApp chat group in 2019. The messages were recovered from an old mobile phone discovered during the police investigation into Ms Everard's murder, the IOPC said. The IOPC is also still looking into how Kent Police in 2015, and the Met this year, handled allegations of indecent exposure which have been linked to Couzens.

"NI facing most difficult winter ever, says Swann","Robin Swann says the hospital system has consistently been operating above capacity Northern Ireland is ""facing into the most difficult winter ever experienced"", Robin Swann has warned. The health minister said there were ""unscheduled pressures"" facing the health and social care system. Earlier, Naomi Long said she feared relaxing rules on face coverings in nightclubs may cause a ""significant"" rise in the transmission of Covid-19. The justice minister said she was concerned about a ""lack of clarity"" in health advice. On Thursday,the executive agreed people will not need to wear masks while dancing in nightclubswhen they reopen next Sunday. Social distancing laws in hospitality venues will also be scrapped. However, Northern Ireland will not be followingEngland and Wales in easing rules around testing for Covid-19 after international travel. From Sunday,those returning to England will only be required to take a lateral flow testafter their arrival but those returning to Northern Ireland will still be required to pay for a more expensive PCR test. Any decision to move to lateral flow tests will require executive consideration and agreement. In a written ministerial statement on Friday, Mr Swann updated assembly members on the pressures facing the health service. ""Over this summer and into the autumn, the Northern Ireland hospital system has consistently been operating above capacity, with many patients waiting on trollies for admission,"" he said. ""This situation is unheard of during the summer months and is an indication of the scale of unscheduled pressures likely facing the HSC system this winter."" Mr Swann detailed funding he had assigned to help support the system, saying he had tabled a bid for an additional Â£30m from the October monitoring round to add to the Â£31.5m secured in the June round. Naomi Long said the impact on messaging around the wearing of face coverings could have ""potential unintended consequences"" It is understood Ms Long and Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon both raised concerns about the changes to Covid restrictions at Thursday's executive meeting. In a letter to her executive colleagues, obtained by BBC News NI, the justice minister warned that the impact on messaging around the wearing of face coverings could have ""potential unintended consequences"". She added: ""Given the extent of Covid transmission in the community, the risk posed by new variants and the high risk nature of nightclub settings, I fear that further relaxation in the wearing of face coverings, particularly when dancing, may lead to a significant increase in transmission."" Health service in NI facing 'worst winter ever' Ms Long said she recognised making changes to allow people to stand to eat or drink without masks was ""necessary"", but said that with such relaxations it would be ""practically impossible to maintain high levels"" of enforcement. The justice minister said she believed that as a result of the changes, it would be hard to justify ""continued requirements to wear masks in other lower risk settings as a consequence"". She also repeated her view that proof of full vaccination and testing should be ""mandatory"" requirements in high-risk environments such as nightclubs. Nightclubs are due to reopen in Northern Ireland on 31 October It is understood that work by Stormont's Department of Health on developing a vaccine passport digital system is ""well advanced"". But Ms Mallon has said the executive was told if ministers agree to make the scheme mandatory, it could take five to six weeks to put in place the legislation enforcing it. She said she was concerned that action from the executive would again be ""too little, too late"". ""We don't have five to six weeks, we need to be implementing it quickly so that when we need to, we can move on this,"" she said. ""I voted against reopening hospitality and nightclubs without mandatory passportsâ¦ we should have this in place, we know vaccines help to protect us. ""You need to ask other ministers why they don't share that viewpoint in the face of overwhelming evidence."" Irish press pause on some Covid-19 reopening plans Anger at clubs opening as maternity is restricted Dr David Farren, the chair of the British Medical Association's (BMA) Consultants Committee said the the Executive's decision is ""madness"". ""I was quoted earlier this week as saying that I haven't seen a health service as busy as this in my 20 years of practice. I stand by that,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback. ""I don't care if people think we are scaremongering. The reason we are highlighting the data and the cases that are there at the minute is because we don't want to see this fall over. ""What happens if the health service gets overwhelmed, frankly, is that people will die."" This video can not be played BMA NI chairman Tom Black warns against easing restrictions further On Thursday, First Minister Paul Givan said Northern Ireland was going to be able to ""move forward"" with further easing. ""We continue to monitor the way in which transmission is spreading, but also the way in which it is spreading in hospitals,"" he said. ""But nobody wants to go back to what we had before. There are consequences with lockdown, people's mental health and cases of domestic violence that took place. ""Lockdown is not a solution without consequences - it has very serious consequences, and we all want to avoid that.""

Man arrested in connection with arena bomb attack,"Twenty-two people died in the bombing on 22 May 2017 A man has been arrested on suspicion of a terrorism offence in connection with the Manchester Arena attack. Twenty-two people were killed when Salman Abedi detonated a bomb at the end of a concert on 22 May 2017. A 24-year-old man, from Manchester, is being held on suspicion of engaging in the preparation of acts of terrorism or assisting others in acts of preparation. He was arrested at Manchester Airport after arriving back in the UK. Greater Manchester Police said the man, from Fallowfield, remained in custody for questioning. Det Ch Supt Simon Barraclough said the force remained ""committed to establishing the truth surrounding the circumstances of the terror attack"". ""Over four years have passed since the atrocity took place but we are unwavering in our dedication to follow each line of inquiry available so that we can provide all those affected by the events at the arena with the answers they rightly deserve,"" he added. Manchester attack: Who were the victims? Hundreds of people were also injured when Abedi, who died in the bombing, detonated his device in the arena foyer at the end of an Ariana Grande concert. His younger brotherHashem Abedi was jailed for at least 55 yearsin August last year after being found guilty of murdering the 22 victims. He was also convicted of attempted murder - encompassing the injured people - and conspiring to cause explosions. The brothers spent months ordering, stockpiling and transporting the deadly materials required for the attack. A public inquiry into the attack started in September last year to explore the circumstances leading up to and surrounding the bombing. This includes whether the attack could have been prevented, what happened on 22 May 2017, the security arrangements around the arena, the emergency response to the bombing and the radicalisation of Salman Abedi.

Haileigh Ashton Lamont said she wanted to tell her own story, in her own words, but also to share her experience of the prosecution process. She said she did so in the hope it might help prepare other victims and survivors considering coming forward. Her abuser, Tommy Harris, 48, pleaded guilty to 42 counts of sexual assault. The charges against Harris, who has an address at Wynchurch Road in Belfast, included rape, attempted rape, indecent assault and gross indecency with a child. The abuse took place over a decade, from 1999 to 2009. It started when Haileigh was seven, and didn't end until she was 18. Last year, after seeing her mental and physical health suffer under the strain, Haileigh reported what had happened to police. Now 30, she said: ""On the 7th of July I walked into a police station in Belfast. I was hysterical, I was panicking, I couldn't breathe. This video can not be played ""If you can imagine the feeling of dread that you've had or the worst day of your life, that was my every day"" ""And that's when I said for the first time in my life: 'My stepfather sexually abused me when I was a child.' ""I thought once I said that out loud in a police station that would be enough. ""But since then, I've had to fight to get justice - and it has been a fight."" Haileigh said her earliest and most thorough memory of the sexual abuse was when she was seven or eight. She said she lived in fear all the time. ""If you can imagine the feeling of dread that you've had or the worst day of your life, that was my every day,"" she said. ""Whenever I was a young child, I didn't know why my skin was crawling, why I wanted to die, because it was a person in a position of trust, and I was too young to understand. ""And then the older I got, I was still a child, but I understood that it was sexual abuse that I was suffering, and so frequently, I had to live with all that, and pretend that I was OK - because I was so fearful of what he would do if I exposed him or somebody found out. ""While I was staying quiet I was protecting a paedophile, that's how I felt."" A judge at Laganside Court told Haileigh she should ""hold her head high"" Haileigh said she still feels an overwhelming urge to apologise to anybody she brought into her life because they were exposed to what had happened. ""But I was just so into survival mode that I didn't see it like that at the time,"" she said. ""I've managed to break it down to me versus him, and I chose myself."" Haileigh wanted to waive the anonymity she is legally entitled to as a victim of sexual abuse in order to ""take control"" of her story ""You can't do what he done to me and get away with it. There has to be consequences,"" she said. ""If I can share my experience and it resonates with one person and they think that if they come forward they might have a better understanding of what to expect, it's worth it then for me."" Haileigh said she wants justice - but what is justice to her now? ""If I'd have answered that back when I walked into the police station - I was so set on there needing to be a conviction,"" she said. ""I fantasised my whole life about justice. ""Justice to me now is the sound of my voice - being able to talk about this and to not be afraid any more after living my whole life in fear."" Haileigh said she is now ""excited"" about her future - she's at university, studying to become a counsellor. ""I feel like I'm at the starting line, like I could do anything,"" she said. ""I am a prime example of not knowing what happens behind closed doors, because I know no-one would have suspected what I've been through or what I was keeping to myself."" Harris will be sentenced next month. On Thursday at Laganside court in Belfast, a judge told Haileigh she should ""hold her head high"", after reading her victim impact statement. He said: ""You have done absolutely everything that could have been expected of you in bringing this case, and bringing it to a conclusion."" Haileigh has this message to her abuser. ""I will not be remembered as the wee girl who was sexually abused,"" she said. ""I will be remembered as the young woman who boldly and bravely stood up for herself and exposed a paedophile. ""That is not a representation of defeat, that is victory."" If you have been affected by the issues raised in this story, help and support can be found atBBC Action Line.

Give every household Â£320 for energy costs - Greens,"This video can not be played Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer: There is nowhere Green Party can't win Every household should be given Â£320 to help with ""spiralling energy bills"", the Green Party of England and Wales have said at the start of their annual conference in Birmingham. In a speech, the party's new leaders said the Â£9bn plan could be paid for with a windfall tax on all landlords of private rented properties. Co-leader Adrian Ramsay argued this could help people avoid fuel poverty. The policy announcement comes amid energy price rises. Earlier this month, around 15 million households saw their bills climb by 12%, as the energy cap was raised. The energy regulator Ofgem has warned that the cap will go up again next April. Why are gas prices so high? France to pay 38m citizens â¬100 each to ease costs New Green leaders focus on power not protests Addressing Green Party activists in Birmingham, Mr Ramsay said their proposal was ""about keeping people safe"". ""It's about the state responding to market failure, it's about human dignity. ""Our proposal is what government should be doing to show leadership - it's an issue which shows how climate justice and social justice go hand in hand."" The party says it also wants to introduce a Green New Deal programme, spending Â£100bn on getting the UK to net zero carbon emissions by 2030 through insulation schemes and renewable energy. By Political Correspondent Ione Wells The Green Party have reasons to be optimistic - they have a record number of councillors, their sister party is in power in the Scottish government, and they're feeling positive about their polling. Rising energy bills and COP26 have got all parties talking about the need to move away from relying on fossil fuels too. But they still have only one MP, Caroline Lucas, in Parliament. And more radical green groups like Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain - who the new leaders have actively distanced themselves from - have been making more front pages than the party in the last few months. The new leaders are adamant they want to be seen as a party not a pressure group - but with every major party now trumpeting green policies, standing out is a key challenge. Mr Ramsay delivered the speech jointly with co-leader Carla Denyer, a Bristol city councillor. She said people had ""grown tired of choosing the 'least worst' option, of being patronised, ignored and told what to think"". ""We are tired of a Tory government playing divide and rule, tired of out of touch policies which ride roughshod over people, tired of politics which amount to little more than an old boys' club serving the interests of its pals,"" she added. And she accused Labour of failing the public and failing to ""take a stand on the biggest issues of the day"". Ms Denyer, a former engineer, said the Greens were committed to a pay rise for key workers, a universal basic income and ending the sale of arms to ""oppressive regimes"". Setting out her party's strategy, she told the conference the Greens could ""win elections in every corner of England and Wales...  there is nowhere we can't win"". Caroline Lucas is the Green Party's only MP in Westminster Mr Ramsay said he wanted to be part of the team that ""gets our second MP elected, and our fourth and our fifth"". The pair concluded their speech by telling the audience this was ""the last chance for serious climate action"" and that ""we and only we have what it takes"". The Greens are in government in Scotland with the SNP, but their sister party in England and Wales remains a minor voice at Westminster with just one MP. However they have had more success at the local level winning 80 more council seats during elections earlier this year. They currently hold 447 seats on 141 different councils.

Here are the day's main Covid headlines:  Today's live page was written by Joseph Lee, Malu Cursino and Doug Faulkner. It was edited by Hamish Mackay. Daily reported Covid cases in Belgium have reached their highest level in almost a year, after a 60% rise over the previous week. On Friday, the country recorded almost 6,500 cases - as many as in November last year, just before the government ordered a second lockdown. However, the infection rate is still below the country's peak in mid-October of last year, when cases were running at 15,000 a day, contributing to Belgium having one of the world's highest per-capita death rates from Covid. But with 87% of the eligible population vaccinated, Belgium's coronavirus commissioner says vaccines are preventing 70% of infections and 90% of hospital admissions. Elsewhere in Europe, Germany has recorded a 70% week-on-week rise in infections, with 19,572 reported on Friday. And as we mentioned earlier, Poland has seen its case numbers rise by 106% in a week. This video can not be played 'Russia's Covid mortality rate similar to WWII' - epidemiologist Dr Vasily Vlassov, an epidemiologist at HSE University, says there is ""definitely"" a Covid crisis in Russia and says that the level of mortality may be similar to that seen during World War Two. He adds that Russia's true daily death toll may be double the ""optimistic"" official figures. Vladimir Putin has told people to stay away from their workplace for a week at the start of November in a bid to slow the spread of the virus. Covid infections in the UK are up 17.9% over the past week,
with 52,009 cases reported yesterday and a further 49,298 today. The rise in infections has led to an increase in
the reproduction value - orR number- from
between 0.9 and 1.1, to 1.0 and 1.2. in England. That means for
every 10 people who have Covid, a further 10 to 12 people will become
infected. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

Lucy Wightman, director of public health for Northamptonshire, says the countyhas ""got to make sure we're using all of the tools in the box"". ""Vaccination is great but it's not a silver bullet,"" she says. A further 763 cases of Covid-19 have been recorded in the county in the latest 24-hour period. ""We need people to be getting all of their doses of the vaccination including the booster when they're eligible,"" she says. ""But that doesn't negate the need for us to still be testing on a regular basis, to still be using face coverings in crowded spaces and for us to be social distancing where we can, think about who we're mixing with on a regular basis and just basic things like handwashing.""

On Thursday,the executive agreed people will not need to wear masks while dancing in nightclubswhen they reopen next Sunday. Health minister Robin Swann has warned thatNorthern Ireland is ""facing into the most difficult winter ever experienced"". Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst The pandemic has triggered Chinese tourism companies into exploring new ways of making money, with online sightseeing trips becoming increasingly popular. The national China Daily newspaper notes that in the last year, popular travel agencies like Qunar have teamed up with theme parks and drone companies to offer livestreaming shows to consumers. In the past 18 months, the paper says ânearly 10 million of its users [have] joined a livestreaming show to enjoy beautiful views via dronesâ of sites such as the Forbidden City or Mount Emei, a mountain sacred in Buddhism. While some companies say this kind of travel can simply be a supplement to in-person travelling, there is a recognition in Chinaâs media that strict Covid-19 controls have left people starved of travel. Tourist sites and companies have often been the first to feel the brunt of Covid-19 controls. When cases of the virus are directed in cities, flights are often immediately suspended, and large-scale venues either significantly reduce their capacity, or close. There have been a further 180 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test across the UK. It takes the total number who have died by that measure to 139,146. The most recent figures also show there are 8,238 patients with Covid in hospitals across the country. A further 48,732 people received a first dose of vaccine on Thursday, while 26,828 received a second dose. A further 49,298 coronavirus cases have been reported across the UK. It marks the 10th consecutive day new cases have been above 40,000. Health Secretary Sajid Javid previously warned daily cases could reach 100,000 a day in the coming months. Two schools in Herefordshire have closed early for half-term
due to a spike in Covid cases. Both Lady Hawkins High School in Kington and Eardisley
Primary School are shut today, allowing for a 10-day âfire breakâ. The schools
will reopen on Monday 1 November. In addition to this, the head teacher at Lady Hawkins, Paul
Jennings, says the school has increased cleaning and reintroduced face masks in
classes. According to the ONS, one in 13 children in school years 7 to 11 tested
positive for Covid last week. Jennings adds: âWe have taken the decision to close for half-term on Thursday 21 October, which is only a day early, but allows everyone 10
full days away from school, to act as a 'fire break' in transmission."" You can read more on this story here. Weâve been asking for your views on whether, amid rising
cases, the government should turn to its âPlan Bâ for winter. Plan B would
include the reintroduction of some social distancing measures and mandatory
mask-wearing in certain circumstances. Mark from Nottingham - who is clinically extremely vulnerable - shared with us why he believes the government
should turn to Plan B for winter. He recently had a hospital appointment and had to commute by bus to
attend the appointment. He says the journey there and back âinvolved four different
busesâ and three of the buses âwere almost fullâ. He says he was âshocked to
see that only two or three passengers were wearing masks or face coveringsâ. Due to his circumstances, Mark says he feels like he is
playing âRussian rouletteâ every time he takes the bus. Mark urges the government to reintroduce mandatory
mask-wearing on public transport, adding the ""slightest infringement"" of a face covering is ""far outweighed by the benefit it
would achieveâ. You can read more about what ""Plan B"" is here. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online A new mutated form of coronavirus that some are calling ""Delta Plus"" may spread more easily than regular Delta, UK experts now say. The UK Health Security Agency has moved it up into the ""variant under investigation"" category, to reflect this possible risk. There is no evidence yet that it causes worse illness. And scientists are confident that existing vaccines should still work well to protect people. Read the full story here. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst There have been 28 symptomatic cases of Covid-19 in the last 24 hours in China. Although by international standards this figure might seem relatively small, these cases span seven provincial-level regions, igniting concerns that China is on the cusp of a large-scale winter outbreak. Four regions have now introduced lockdowns: Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Guizhou and the capital, Beijing. China has a zero-Covid strategy, and immediately locks down communities when new cases are confirmed, to prevent transmission. Large-scale testing drives are also ordered, and millions of people are tested for Covid-19 often within two or three days. More than 70% of Chinaâs population has been fully vaccinated, and there are projections that China will have fully vaccinated more than 80% of the population by the end of the year. Nevertheless, there is still a lot of caution. Booster jabs are currently being rolled out in many major cities, and the Wuhan marathon, which was set to take place this Sunday, has now been postponed - even though there are currently no cases in the city. Boris Johnson says there is ""nothing to indicate"" that a full lockdown with a ""stay at home"" order is on the cards this winter. He says: ""I've got to tell you at the moment that we see absolutely nothing to indicate that that's on the cards at all."" The prime minister's visit to the vaccine centre lasted about 40 minutes. He spoke with staff and members of the public, greeting people with elbow bumps. Johnson, who was wearing a mask, also spoke to two pharmacists who were preparing vaccine doses. We've got more from the prime minister, who is at a vccination centre in west London. Asked if he is ignoring advice from government scientists about working from home, Boris Johnson says ministers keep measures under constant review and ""we do whatever we have to do to protect the public"". ""What we want people to do is to come forward and get their jabs,"" he says. ""We also want young people, we want kids at school, to be getting their jabs. ""There'll be booking systems opening from tomorrow in addition to the vaccination programme in schools."" He adds it is ""important"" people get a booster jab because ""the double vaccination provides a lot of protection against serious illness and death but it doesn't protect you against catching the disease, and it doesn't protect you against passing it on"". ""So now is the time to get your booster,"" he says. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says that the government's autumn and winter plan ""always predicted that cases would rise around about now"". Speaking during a visit to a Covid vaccination centre in west London, he says we are seeing ""high levels of infection"" but they are not outside the parameters of what was predicted. ""But it's very important that people do follow the guidance on general behaviour,"" he says. ""Wear a mask, wash hands, ventilation, all that kind of thing, but also get your booster jab, and that's the key message that we want to get across."" The PM says the booster programme has been planned for this time of year because ""there is some evidence, obviously, that the vaccines start to wane"" - but adds that a new study suggests a booster offers ""very, very good protection"". An estimated 5.3 million booster doses of Covid-19 vaccine have been delivered in the UK, new figures show. It is the first time data on boosters has been reported by all four nations. There have been: It means around one in nine people in the UK who have received a first and second dose of vaccine are likely to have also received a booster. The figures have been published by NHS England, Public Health Scotland, Public Health Wales and the Northern Ireland Department of Health. The figure for England includes a small number of third primary doses of vaccine, NHS England says. The government hasfaced calls this week to introduce its Covid winter Plan Bamid rising case numbers. So far the government has resisted moving from Plan A - which involves encouraging the take up of booster shots and lateral flow tests. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies says the government needs to prepare to put Plan B measures - such as stricter face mask rules and greater social distancing - in place. As you can see from the graph below, the percentage of people practising basic Covid prevention measures has fallen. And the proportion of people working exclusively from home has also fallen after the country eased restrictions. Sage says that advising people to work from home could have the greatest impact on stopping the virus spreading. The NHS in Lanarkshire hasmoved to its highest risk levelas all three of its hospitals have reached maximum capacity. The military is already providing additional support at University hospitals Hairmyres, Monklands and Wishaw. But the health board describes occupancy levels as ""critical"" and says the ""sustained pressure"" shows no signs of easing. It also confirms some elective cancer procedures have been cancelled. Deputy chief executive Laura Ace says the area is facing  ""relentless pressures, bed shortages and staff shortages due to sickness, stress and self-isolation"". Earlier this week,NHS Grampianbecame the latest Scottish health board to ask for military help amid the pandemic, after NHS Lanarkshire and NHS Borders. Richard GalpinBBC World Affairs reporter Near the darkened entrance of Hospital Number One in the city of Vologda in Russia's north-west, an ambulance crew delivers yet another Covid patient, an elderly man struggling to breathe and barely alive. Inside the hospital, the wards are teeming with the sick and the dying. Doctors here say out of 750 patients currently in the hospital with Covid, 700 of them had not been vaccinated. Across the country, more than 1,000 people are dying each day, with a total of more than 220,000 deaths so far. These are record numbers for Russia, the worst-hit in Europe. One of the key explanations for this record number of cases and deaths is a lack of trust in the Sputnik V and other Russian-made coronavirus vaccines among many in the population. This, in part, is the result of many years of scepticism of what the authorities say or do. In Vologda just 26% of the population has been vaccinated, one of the lowest levels in the country.

attend the appointment. He says the journey there and back âinvolved four different
busesâ and three of the buses âwere almost fullâ. He says he was âshocked to
see that only two or three passengers were wearing masks or face coveringsâ. Due to his circumstances, Mark says he feels like he is
playing âRussian rouletteâ every time he takes the bus. Mark urges the government to reintroduce mandatory
mask-wearing on public transport, adding the ""slightest infringement"" of a face covering is ""far outweighed by the benefit it
would achieveâ. You can read more about what ""Plan B"" is here. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online A new mutated form of coronavirus that some are calling ""Delta Plus"" may spread more easily than regular Delta, UK experts now say. The UK Health Security Agency has moved it up into the ""variant under investigation"" category, to reflect this possible risk. There is no evidence yet that it causes worse illness. And scientists are confident that existing vaccines should still work well to protect people. Read the full story here. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst There have been 28 symptomatic cases of Covid-19 in the last 24 hours in China. Although by international standards this figure might seem relatively small, these cases span seven provincial-level regions, igniting concerns that China is on the cusp of a large-scale winter outbreak. Four regions have now introduced lockdowns: Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Guizhou and the capital, Beijing. China has a zero-Covid strategy, and immediately locks down communities when new cases are confirmed, to prevent transmission. Large-scale testing drives are also ordered, and millions of people are tested for Covid-19 often within two or three days. More than 70% of Chinaâs population has been fully vaccinated, and there are projections that China will have fully vaccinated more than 80% of the population by the end of the year. Nevertheless, there is still a lot of caution. Booster jabs are currently being rolled out in many major cities, and the Wuhan marathon, which was set to take place this Sunday, has now been postponed - even though there are currently no cases in the city. Boris Johnson says there is ""nothing to indicate"" that a full lockdown with a ""stay at home"" order is on the cards this winter. He says: ""I've got to tell you at the moment that we see absolutely nothing to indicate that that's on the cards at all."" The prime minister's visit to the vaccine centre lasted about 40 minutes. He spoke with staff and members of the public, greeting people with elbow bumps. Johnson, who was wearing a mask, also spoke to two pharmacists who were preparing vaccine doses. We've got more from the prime minister, who is at a vccination centre in west London. Asked if he is ignoring advice from government scientists about working from home, Boris Johnson says ministers keep measures under constant review and ""we do whatever we have to do to protect the public"". ""What we want people to do is to come forward and get their jabs,"" he says. ""We also want young people, we want kids at school, to be getting their jabs. ""There'll be booking systems opening from tomorrow in addition to the vaccination programme in schools."" He adds it is ""important"" people get a booster jab because ""the double vaccination provides a lot of protection against serious illness and death but it doesn't protect you against catching the disease, and it doesn't protect you against passing it on"". ""So now is the time to get your booster,"" he says. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says that the government's autumn and winter plan ""always predicted that cases would rise around about now"". Speaking during a visit to a Covid vaccination centre in west London, he says we are seeing ""high levels of infection"" but they are not outside the parameters of what was predicted. ""But it's very important that people do follow the guidance on general behaviour,"" he says. ""Wear a mask, wash hands, ventilation, all that kind of thing, but also get your booster jab, and that's the key message that we want to get across."" The PM says the booster programme has been planned for this time of year because ""there is some evidence, obviously, that the vaccines start to wane"" - but adds that a new study suggests a booster offers ""very, very good protection"". An estimated 5.3 million booster doses of Covid-19 vaccine have been delivered in the UK, new figures show. It is the first time data on boosters has been reported by all four nations. There have been: It means around one in nine people in the UK who have received a first and second dose of vaccine are likely to have also received a booster. The figures have been published by NHS England, Public Health Scotland, Public Health Wales and the Northern Ireland Department of Health. The figure for England includes a small number of third primary doses of vaccine, NHS England says. The government hasfaced calls this week to introduce its Covid winter Plan Bamid rising case numbers. So far the government has resisted moving from Plan A - which involves encouraging the take up of booster shots and lateral flow tests. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies says the government needs to prepare to put Plan B measures - such as stricter face mask rules and greater social distancing - in place. As you can see from the graph below, the percentage of people practising basic Covid prevention measures has fallen. And the proportion of people working exclusively from home has also fallen after the country eased restrictions. Sage says that advising people to work from home could have the greatest impact on stopping the virus spreading. The NHS in Lanarkshire hasmoved to its highest risk levelas all three of its hospitals have reached maximum capacity. The military is already providing additional support at University hospitals Hairmyres, Monklands and Wishaw. But the health board describes occupancy levels as ""critical"" and says the ""sustained pressure"" shows no signs of easing. It also confirms some elective cancer procedures have been cancelled. Deputy chief executive Laura Ace says the area is facing  ""relentless pressures, bed shortages and staff shortages due to sickness, stress and self-isolation"". Earlier this week,NHS Grampianbecame the latest Scottish health board to ask for military help amid the pandemic, after NHS Lanarkshire and NHS Borders. Richard GalpinBBC World Affairs reporter Near the darkened entrance of Hospital Number One in the city of Vologda in Russia's north-west, an ambulance crew delivers yet another Covid patient, an elderly man struggling to breathe and barely alive. Inside the hospital, the wards are teeming with the sick and the dying. Doctors here say out of 750 patients currently in the hospital with Covid, 700 of them had not been vaccinated. Across the country, more than 1,000 people are dying each day, with a total of more than 220,000 deaths so far. These are record numbers for Russia, the worst-hit in Europe. One of the key explanations for this record number of cases and deaths is a lack of trust in the Sputnik V and other Russian-made coronavirus vaccines among many in the population. This, in part, is the result of many years of scepticism of what the authorities say or do. In Vologda just 26% of the population has been vaccinated, one of the lowest levels in the country.

"NI facing most difficult winter ever, says SwannThe health minister's warning comes as other ministers raise concerns over opening of nightclubs.","Robin Swann says the hospital system has consistently been operating above capacity Northern Ireland is ""facing into the most difficult winter ever experienced"", Robin Swann has warned. The health minister said there were ""unscheduled pressures"" facing the health and social care system. Earlier, Naomi Long said she feared relaxing rules on face coverings in nightclubs may cause a ""significant"" rise in the transmission of Covid-19. The justice minister said she was concerned about a ""lack of clarity"" in health advice. On Thursday,the executive agreed people will not need to wear masks while dancing in nightclubswhen they reopen next Sunday. Social distancing laws in hospitality venues will also be scrapped. However, Northern Ireland will not be followingEngland and Wales in easing rules around testing for Covid-19 after international travel. From Sunday,those returning to England will only be required to take a lateral flow testafter their arrival but those returning to Northern Ireland will still be required to pay for a more expensive PCR test. Any decision to move to lateral flow tests will require executive consideration and agreement. In a written ministerial statement on Friday, Mr Swann updated assembly members on the pressures facing the health service. ""Over this summer and into the autumn, the Northern Ireland hospital system has consistently been operating above capacity, with many patients waiting on trollies for admission,"" he said. ""This situation is unheard of during the summer months and is an indication of the scale of unscheduled pressures likely facing the HSC system this winter."" Mr Swann detailed funding he had assigned to help support the system, saying he had tabled a bid for an additional Â£30m from the October monitoring round to add to the Â£31.5m secured in the June round. Naomi Long said the impact on messaging around the wearing of face coverings could have ""potential unintended consequences"" It is understood Ms Long and Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon both raised concerns about the changes to Covid restrictions at Thursday's executive meeting. In a letter to her executive colleagues, obtained by BBC News NI, the justice minister warned that the impact on messaging around the wearing of face coverings could have ""potential unintended consequences"". She added: ""Given the extent of Covid transmission in the community, the risk posed by new variants and the high risk nature of nightclub settings, I fear that further relaxation in the wearing of face coverings, particularly when dancing, may lead to a significant increase in transmission."" Health service in NI facing 'worst winter ever' Ms Long said she recognised making changes to allow people to stand to eat or drink without masks was ""necessary"", but said that with such relaxations it would be ""practically impossible to maintain high levels"" of enforcement. The justice minister said she believed that as a result of the changes, it would be hard to justify ""continued requirements to wear masks in other lower risk settings as a consequence"". She also repeated her view that proof of full vaccination and testing should be ""mandatory"" requirements in high-risk environments such as nightclubs. Nightclubs are due to reopen in Northern Ireland on 31 October It is understood that work by Stormont's Department of Health on developing a vaccine passport digital system is ""well advanced"". But Ms Mallon has said the executive was told if ministers agree to make the scheme mandatory, it could take five to six weeks to put in place the legislation enforcing it. She said she was concerned that action from the executive would again be ""too little, too late"". ""We don't have five to six weeks, we need to be implementing it quickly so that when we need to, we can move on this,"" she said. ""I voted against reopening hospitality and nightclubs without mandatory passportsâ¦ we should have this in place, we know vaccines help to protect us. ""You need to ask other ministers why they don't share that viewpoint in the face of overwhelming evidence."" Irish press pause on some Covid-19 reopening plans Anger at clubs opening as maternity is restricted Dr David Farren, the chair of the British Medical Association's (BMA) Consultants Committee said the the Executive's decision is ""madness"". ""I was quoted earlier this week as saying that I haven't seen a health service as busy as this in my 20 years of practice. I stand by that,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback. ""I don't care if people think we are scaremongering. The reason we are highlighting the data and the cases that are there at the minute is because we don't want to see this fall over. ""What happens if the health service gets overwhelmed, frankly, is that people will die."" This video can not be played BMA NI chairman Tom Black warns against easing restrictions further On Thursday, First Minister Paul Givan said Northern Ireland was going to be able to ""move forward"" with further easing. ""We continue to monitor the way in which transmission is spreading, but also the way in which it is spreading in hospitals,"" he said. ""But nobody wants to go back to what we had before. There are consequences with lockdown, people's mental health and cases of domestic violence that took place. ""Lockdown is not a solution without consequences - it has very serious consequences, and we all want to avoid that.""

"'While I was quiet, I was protecting a paedophile'A victim waives her anonymity to speak out about the sexual abuse inflicted by her stepfather.Northern IrelandBreaking|Breaking newsAlec Baldwin 'shock and sadness' at film-set deathDirector of photography Halyna Hutchins was killed by a prop gun fired by the actor in New Mexico.US & Canada","Haileigh Ashton Lamont said she wanted to tell her own story, in her own words A Belfast woman who was sexually abused by her stepfather as a child has waived her anonymity to speak out about what happened to her. Haileigh Ashton Lamont said she wanted to tell her own story, in her own words, but also to share her experience of the prosecution process. She said she did so in the hope it might help prepare other victims and survivors considering coming forward. Her abuser, Tommy Harris, 48, pleaded guilty to 42 counts of sexual assault. The charges against Harris, who has an address at Wynchurch Road in Belfast, included rape, attempted rape, indecent assault and gross indecency with a child. The abuse took place over a decade, from 1999 to 2009. It started when Haileigh was seven, and didn't end until she was 18. Last year, after seeing her mental and physical health suffer under the strain, Haileigh reported what had happened to police. Now 30, she said: ""On the 7th of July I walked into a police station in Belfast. I was hysterical, I was panicking, I couldn't breathe. This video can not be played ""If you can imagine the feeling of dread that you've had or the worst day of your life, that was my every day"" ""And that's when I said for the first time in my life: 'My stepfather sexually abused me when I was a child.' ""I thought once I said that out loud in a police station that would be enough. ""But since then, I've had to fight to get justice - and it has been a fight."" Haileigh said her earliest and most thorough memory of the sexual abuse was when she was seven or eight. She said she lived in fear all the time. ""If you can imagine the feeling of dread that you've had or the worst day of your life, that was my every day,"" she said. ""Whenever I was a young child, I didn't know why my skin was crawling, why I wanted to die, because it was a person in a position of trust, and I was too young to understand. ""And then the older I got, I was still a child, but I understood that it was sexual abuse that I was suffering, and so frequently, I had to live with all that, and pretend that I was OK - because I was so fearful of what he would do if I exposed him or somebody found out. ""While I was staying quiet I was protecting a paedophile, that's how I felt."" A judge at Laganside Court told Haileigh she should ""hold her head high"" Haileigh said she still feels an overwhelming urge to apologise to anybody she brought into her life because they were exposed to what had happened. ""But I was just so into survival mode that I didn't see it like that at the time,"" she said. ""I've managed to break it down to me versus him, and I chose myself."" Haileigh wanted to waive the anonymity she is legally entitled to as a victim of sexual abuse in order to ""take control"" of her story ""You can't do what he done to me and get away with it. There has to be consequences,"" she said. ""If I can share my experience and it resonates with one person and they think that if they come forward they might have a better understanding of what to expect, it's worth it then for me."" Haileigh said she wants justice - but what is justice to her now? ""If I'd have answered that back when I walked into the police station - I was so set on there needing to be a conviction,"" she said. ""I fantasised my whole life about justice. ""Justice to me now is the sound of my voice - being able to talk about this and to not be afraid any more after living my whole life in fear."" Haileigh said she is now ""excited"" about her future - she's at university, studying to become a counsellor. ""I feel like I'm at the starting line, like I could do anything,"" she said. ""I am a prime example of not knowing what happens behind closed doors, because I know no-one would have suspected what I've been through or what I was keeping to myself."" Harris will be sentenced next month. On Thursday at Laganside court in Belfast, a judge told Haileigh she should ""hold her head high"", after reading her victim impact statement. He said: ""You have done absolutely everything that could have been expected of you in bringing this case, and bringing it to a conclusion."" Haileigh has this message to her abuser. ""I will not be remembered as the wee girl who was sexually abused,"" she said. ""I will be remembered as the young woman who boldly and bravely stood up for herself and exposed a paedophile. ""That is not a representation of defeat, that is victory."" If you have been affected by the issues raised in this story, help and support can be found atBBC Action Line.

How Belarus is helping âtouristsâ break into the EU,"Belarus has been accused of taking revenge for EU sanctions by offering migrants tourist visas, and helping them across its border. The BBC has tracked one group trying to reach Germany. The mobile phone camera pans left and right, but no-one moves. The exhausted travellers lie scattered among the trees. Jamil has his head in his hands, his wife Roshin slumped forward next to him. The others look dead. Late afternoon light slants through the forest, the pine trees forming a dense natural prison. They've been walking since four in the morning. ""We're shattered, absolutely shattered,"" Jamil's cousin Idris intones, almost mechanically. The Syrian friends have fought through thickets and waded through foul-smelling swamps to get here. They've already missed their first rendezvous with a smuggler, and they've run out of food and water. The Syrians are numb with cold but don't dare light a fire. They've crossed from Belarus into Poland, so have finally made it to the EU. But they're not safe yet. Thousands of others, encouraged by Belarus to cross into Poland, Lithuania and Latvia, have ended up in detention instead. At least seven have died of hypothermia in the Polish forest. Idris - his head covered to keep warm - records a video in the forest We've been tracking Idris and his friends since they left northern Iraq in late September. Idris has recorded their progress on his phone and sent us a series of videos along the way. The group are Syrian Kurds, in their 20s, looking to Europe for a better future. They are all from Kobane, the scene of ferocious fighting between Kurdish fighters and Islamic State militants in late 2014. But while their motives - political instability at home, fear of conscription, lack of employment - are the familiar refrain of migrants the world over, the route they have taken is new. Idris admits he might not have tried to leave Syria if Belarus's autocratic leader, Alexander Lukashenko, had not offered a new, apparently safer route. ""Belarus has an ongoing feud with the EU,"" he told me, when I asked him why he had decided to attempt the journey to Europe. ""The Belarus president decided to open its borders with the EU."" Idris was referring to Mr Lukashenko's warningearlier this year, that he would no longer stop migrants and drugs from crossing into EU member states. The Belarus president had been infuriated by successive waves of EU sanctions, imposed following his country's disputed 2020 presidential election, the subsequent hounding of political opponents, andthe forced diversion of a RyanAir jet carrying an opposition journalist and his girlfriend. Officials in neighbouring Lithuania say they saw warning signs as early as March. ""It started as indications from the Belarusian government that they are ready to simplify visa proceedingsâ¦ for 'tourists' from Iraq,"" Lithuania's Deputy Minister of Interior, Kestutis Lancinskas tells us. Instead of taking hazardous journeys by boat across the Mediterranean, all migrants now need to do is fly to Belarus, drive for several hours to the border, and then simply cross on foot into one of the three neighbouring EU countries - Poland, Lithuania and Latvia. In July and August, Lithuania saw 50 times more asylum seekers than in the whole of 2020. ""The route is obviously a lot easier than going through Turkey and North Africa,"" Idris said. He and his friends had started out from Irbil in northern Iraq on 25 September. Idris had been working there and left his wife and twin baby daughters in Kobane, promising they could eventually join him in Europe if he made it. Collapsed building in Kobane - the scene of ferocious fighting in 2014 They are part of a generation of Syrians whose lives have been blighted by 10 years of civil war. Idris has already spent time as a refugee in neighbouring Turkey. ""It's a long story, my friend, and I regret many things,"" Idris told me over the phone when I asked him what motivated him. ""But nothing's in our control. There's no future for me in Syria."" In one of Idris's first videos, recorded outside Irbil airport, he is clearly upbeat about the journey ahead. They've got their tickets, and seven-day tourist visas for Belarus. They're ready to go. This video can not be played  The process so far had been relatively simple. To find out just how simple, we flew to northern Iraq to meet the people involved. Irbil is the bustling capital of the country's autonomous Kurdish region. A city of more than one-and-a-half million people, it's home to hundreds of thousands of refugees from neighbouring Syria, as well as other parts of Iraq. For many, it's also where the journey to Europe begins. Not that you'd know that immediately. There are travel agents, to be sure. Lots of them. But this is a word of mouth business, with travel tips disseminated online in Facebook and chat groups. In an office strewn with passports - mostly Syrian - Murad took me through the process. Murad is not his real name. Even though his role is not illegal - all he does is arrange the visas and flights to the Belarusian capital Minsk - he doesn't want to be identified. Back in the summer, with news of Mr Lukashenko's threat to the EU bouncing all over social media, Murad contacted friends in Belarus, asking about the new visa rules. ""They said 'yes, it's easy now',"" Murad recalled. ""I knew it's going to be the same as what happened in 2015 with Turkey."" In 2015, Turkey's President, Recep Tayyip Erdogan, was also in dispute with the EU. He allowed hundreds of thousands of migrants to pass through his country, until the EU agreed to a â¬6bn (Â£5bn) deal to help Ankara meet the cost of the influx. For migrants now looking for safe passage via Minsk, Belarusian travel companies initially issued electronic invitations to allow people to board flights for the capital. But as cowboy operations started to make money from fake invitations, the rules changed. Now, migrants need a physical visa stamp in their passport before they can book a flight. It takes longer, but still isn't complicated. ""Travel agent"" Murad in Irbil Next, a smuggler. This is where it gets expensive. Murad said he didn't work with smugglers, advising his clients that it's actually cheaper and more reliable to find one when they reach Minsk. But when we met one ourselves, it was on the street outside Murad's office and the two men clearly knew each other. We were told that Jouwan - again not his real name - was a veteran smuggler, having arranged trips through Turkey and Greece during the 2015 migration crisis. ""If you're using a smuggler,"" said Jouwan, ""it's going to cost you a lot. Between $9,000 and $12,000."" After all, it was an unpredictable journey, Jouwan said. ""You're going through unknown woods, in a foreign country. Robbers are waiting to snatch your money. The mafia is watching you. There are wild animals on the loose, rivers and swamps to cross. You're leaping into the unknown, even if you're using GPS."" Asked about the authorities in Belarus, Jouwan was clear about their role. ""They're facilitating the issue. They're helping people."" When Idris and his friends reached the Belarusian capital Minsk, they found it teeming with migrants all beating the same path to Europe. Idris's footage from Minsk airport shows a crammed arrivals hall - passengers sprawled out across the floor waiting to be processed. In August, Iraqi Airways bowed to pressure from the EU and cancelled direct flights from Baghdad to Minsk. But migrants continue to arrive on flights from Istanbul, Dubai and Damascus. Crowded arrivals hall at Minsk airport Like many who pass this way, Idris and his friends had reservations at Minsk's Sputnik Hotel, which advertises itself as ""ideal for business trips and family holidays"". Others have been less fortunate. Footage shared on social media claims to show migrants in sleeping bags, sheltering in a nearby underpass. When I reached Idris by phone, he told me they were in touch with smugglers to take them across the Polish border and on to Germany. Their departure was imminent. Idris acknowledged the challenges ahead. ""We're crossing the borders illegally. We don't know what will happen. We can't trust anyone, not even our smuggler. We're putting our fate in God's hands."" The trip from Irbil to Belarus, he said, had already cost $5,000 (Â£3,600) per person, including airfare, hotel reservations and tourist visas. They were still haggling with smugglers about the onward journey. A day later, we spoke again. There had been a setback. The group had left Minsk too late to meet a smuggler and make it into Poland. They were now at another hotel, close to the border. The costs were piling up. The group had to take two private cars from Minsk, paying $400 for each. Trepidation was setting in, because for all the expense, the outcome could still be disastrous. ""We don't know whether we're going to make it or not,"" he told me. ""Are we going to get stuck in the woods, or will it just be a matter of four or five hours [walking], just like the smuggler told us?"" Another short video arrived before they set off. ""Pray for us,"" Idris says into the camera. Across Belarus's north-western border, in Lithuania, we found that the prayers and dreams of thousands of migrants like Idris had been shattered. By August, more than 4,000 had made it across a largely unfenced border. Some made the onward journey to Western Europe, but many were caught. They're now being held in detention centres across the country while Lithuania figures out what to do with them. While some have been granted asylum, so far this has not included any Syrians or Iraqis. At Kybartai, in the west, more than 670 migrants have been moved to a converted prison. The authorities are trying to make it as habitable as possible. The warm cells are a definite improvement on the tented camps near the border where the migrants were being accommodated until recently. But when we visited, the high walls, razor wire and watchtowers created an unmistakably grim atmosphere. ""I need freedom,"" several people shouted from their cells. The inmates were all single men, from more than 20 different countries. Most were Iraqis and Syrians, but others had come from as far afield as Yemen, Sierra Leone and even Sri Lanka. The detention centre for migrants at Kybartai in Lithuania Abbas, from Iraq, said conditions were terrible and the migrants were being treated like criminals. ""Is it our fault Belarus opened its borders to the EU?"" he asked. At the end of his journey he was briefly detained by the Belarusian border guards. But it seemed all they had wanted was a souvenir. ""They took selfies with us and showed us the way,"" he said. Fed up with his treatment and aware that his $11,000 journey had come to an abrupt, humiliating end, Abbas said he was thinking of going back. ""But I'm not going to live in Iraq. I'll live in Turkey. I have no idea what's going to happen though. I don't have any money."" But even though the detainees recognised they were pawns in a geopolitical tussle between Belarus and the EU, they mostly thanked Mr Lukashenko for giving them this chance. ""When I get out, I'm going to get his name tattooed on my arm,"" Azzal, another Iraqi, told me. The flow of migrants into Lithuania has now been stemmed, thanks in part to the country's increased border security, assisted by the EU's border management agency, Frontex. But guards also showed us places where the border was still poorly protected, sometimes little more than a gap in the forest. A section of open border between Lithuania and Belarus At one such spot, Belarusian border guards and soldiers sauntered past on the other side, filming us on a mobile phone but avoiding eye contact. ""In old times we had really good communication about illegal immigrants,"" Vytautas Kuodis, of Lithuania's State Border Guard Service, told me. All that ended over the summer. Calls from the Lithuanian side now go unanswered. ""Mostly they ignore us,"" Mr Kuodis said. Although dozens of migrants still try to cross into Lithuania each day from Belarus, most are now heading for Poland. Idris and his friends' second attempt to cross the Polish border ended - like their first - in failure. Videos, shot furtively on Idris's mobile phone, show tense roadside conversations, with voices in Russian, English and Arabic. There was a scary encounter with Belarusian police, who stopped the group, took their passports and told the drivers to return the migrants to Minsk. They drove back to the Sputnik Hotel, where the drivers then demanded a fee to recover the group's passports from the police. At the hotel, Idris and his friends now discovered a growing network of smugglers, sorting out accommodation and logistics. And the hotel was full of new arrivals - Syrians, Iraqis and Yemenis. ""The numbers are increasing every day,"" Idris says in a video shot outside the Sputnik. To add to the group's complications, their tourist visas expired, forcing them to check out of the hotel and into a flat. Finally, 11 days after arriving in Minsk, they tried for a third time to reach Poland, travelling to Brest in the far south-west of Belarus. This time they managed to get to the Polish border, arriving just after midnight. At this point, Belarusian soldiers made a crucial intervention. Just like Ammar, the teacher detained in Lithuania, and others who have posted on social media over the summer, the Syrians found the Belarusian military eager to assist. As the group stood close to the border, soldiers appeared and told them to wait. Minutes later, an armoured car arrived and took them to a military truck, where Idris and his friends found 50 other migrants huddled inside. The truck drove for a short while, said Idris. ""Then the soldier asked us to wait, so they could make sure the road to the Polish border was open."" There are fences being put up along the Polish border, though migrants head for places where they are low or non-existent He then escorted the entire group for 200m (656ft) and, says Idris, showed them the way to Poland. Idris said the soldier even helped them cross the border. ""I believe he cut the wire for us."" Splitting up into smaller groups, and with a GPS reference to guide them to a rendezvous a few miles inside Poland, the travellers plunged into the forest. The videos Idris sent over the next two days show the friends at their lowest ebb, the journey finally taking its toll. The distance they travelled on foot was no more than a dozen miles. But the two-day hike through swamps and dense forest brought them to the edge of exhaustion. At one point, Idris fell into a ditch and hurt his leg, losing the group precious time. This video can not be played  Finally, on 9 October, they reached their pick-up point near the Polish town of Milejczyce, where a car was waiting. By dawn they were in Germany, and they split up soon afterwards to go their separate ways. Jamil and Roshin to Frankfurt, Zozan to Denmark to meet her fiancÃ©. Idris carried on to the Netherlands, where he plans to report to the authorities. He's heard that if he is granted asylum, Dutch family reunification rules will make it possible to bring his wife and twin daughters from Kobane. But it's going to take time. ""I've been researching refugee status in Europe,"" he says. ""I think it will take a year or two."" It's hard to know how many people have made it to their intended destinations since Mr Lukashenko opened his country's doors. Belarus has denied allegations of inducing migrants to fly there on the false promise of legal entry to the EU, and it blames Western politicians for the situation on the border. At least 10,000 migrants are now in detention - in the Baltics, Poland and Germany. For many, it has been a harrowing ordeal. A costly waste of time and money - and in some cases - lives. Across affected countries, calls for stricter controls are mounting. But so far, there's no sign that Mr Lukashenko is backing down.

Southend falls silent to remember Sir David Amess,"People gathered on the streets of Southend to pay their respects to Sir David, who had been an MP in Essex since 1983 Southend has remembered Sir David Amess, a week after he was killed at a constituency surgery. Sir David, 69, wasstabbed to deathshortly after midday last Friday, in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex. Residents and shopkeepers bowed their heads in silence, broken by applause and the release of blue balloons in memory of the Southend West MP. Ali Harbi Ali, 25, isdue at the Old Baileycharged with murder and preparing terrorist acts. People on Eastwood Road released blue balloons at the end of the silence Amess replacement must be from area, insist locals 'I keep crying over David's dream come true' The lesser-known concerns of Sir David Amess James Duddridge, the MP for Rochford and Southend East, said: ""It is going to be very difficult not just for the family but for the whole community."" After the silence, he told mourners: ""Speaking to Jo Cox's family, it took them a long time to recover and we must spend time together as a community and not be afraid to cry and share a cuddle, share a story, to share a funny story as well as a sensible story. ""I think that is one of the things that the Cox family said was really important - to remember a person and spend time together as a community. Southend was granted city status in honour of Sir David, who had lobbied for the title for more than 20 years. Ian Gilbert, leader of Southend Borough Council, said heartwarming stories of Sir David were shared at an ""emotional"" full council meeting on Thursday night. Sir David Amess had campaigned for Southend to be a city for more than 20 years ""Pretty much everybody who has lived in Southend for some time has a story to share about him, he was part of the fabric of the town and touched many, many people,"" he said. ""I've been heartened by the way the community, quite spontaneously, has come together to support one another at this difficult time. ""I hope the honour of being accorded city status, which is something Sir David campaigned on tirelessly for many years, will be something that can help bring the community together and honour his memory."" Father Jeffrey Woolnough (left), who had attempted to administer last rites to his friend Sir David, was among those gathered in Leigh-on-Sea The silence was organised by local businesses who wanted to pay their respects A week ago, Sir David was meeting constituents, as he loved to do, at Belfairs Methodist Church. He'd been chatting and laughing with locals outside the church before he was killed. He died as he had lived, serving people, for nearly 40 years. He had known five prime ministers. So many people I have met in the past few days have stories of how he had helped them. So many here considered him a friend. This silence is the idea of businesses from the Belfairs area. There is a parade of shops here where he was so well known, just as he was across the town and the borough, and beyond. There is sadness, and a deep shared sympathy with Sir David's wife and children. People in Leigh-on Sea have been remembering Sir David Among those gathered was Father Jeffrey Woolnough, who had rushed to the church when he heard that Sir David, a devout Catholic, had been stabbed in the hope of giving him the last rites. He was unable to deliver the sacrament as the area had become a crime scene. He said Sir David spoke to people from all parties, races and religions, and ""it was such a great gift and it was tireless because it was sincere"". Butcher Tony Phillips, who closed up his shop for the tribute, said: ""We are all just so very sad that he is no longer with us. ""We used to see him quite regularly. He used to come in to the shop every now and then to see if we had any problems. He will be sadly missed."" Estate agent Rob Cooke said: ""Sir David was very much part of the community and obviously we are just gutted with what has happened. I just wanted to pay my respects and to think about him and his family. ""I think it is going to take quite a long time for the community to recover from what has happened.""

"Lockdowns will not help NHS, says ex-health boss","Dr Roland Salmon says he hopes NHS winter pressures do not lead to wider Covid restrictions Covid lockdown restrictions should not be brought back to help NHS Wales deal with winter pressures, a former health boss has said. Dr Roland Salmon, former director of communicable diseases for Public Health Wales, said he believed such rules were only ""at best marginally"" beneficial. He said efforts should be redoubled to vaccinate those most at risk. Latest hospital figures show a 20% rise in two weeks of patients with confirmed Covid, while bed occupancy has hit 90%. Health Minister Eluned Morgan has saidfurther Covid rules before Christmas are ""unlikely"" at the moment. What do Wales' rising Covid cases and hospital numbers mean? How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? The latest figures show Wales' case rate hit a record high - 681.9 on Friday - although higher case rates have still produced relatively fewer hospital cases and deaths. Blaenau Gwent has the highest case rate in the UK (1,185 cases per 100,000), with the climbing case rates in Wales mostly concentrated in south Wales. Four Welsh local authorities are among the highest, with south-west English counties also featuring prominently. The Office for National Statistics estimated 70,300 people have Covid-19 in Wales. This is the highest infection estimate since it started its weekly swab survey in August last year. That is the equivalent of one in 45 people or 2.31% of the population. Infections are estimated to be higher in school-age youngsters - and latest case figures also showed 27% of all positive tests were among the 10 to 19 age group. Public Health Wales reported 11 further deaths - an average of eight deaths a day in the last week - although deaths were eight times higher at this point in the second wave. The average number of confirmed Covid patients in hospital was 511 on Thursday, a 20% rise across Wales in two weeks. This is a third of the number we saw at the same point in January. On Thursday, ahead of a difficult winter, the Welsh NHS recorded itsworst performance figures ever. Dr Roland Salmon believes lockdown restrictions are not the answer to NHS Wales winter pressures NHS Wales chief executive Andrew Goodall said the system was running ""at the hottest we've seen"" due to Covid. Speaking onBBC Radio Wales Breakfast, Dr Salmon said he was ""certainly concerned about the pressure on the NHS"" with staff shortages, high bed occupancy and Covid. ""However, one of my abiding hopes is that this doesn't lead to a re-imposition of wider social restrictions,"" he said. ""It doesn't seem to me that they actually worked the first time, or at best marginally in the short term."" He argued that such restrictions ""cost a lot"", not only financially but in terms of mental illness, domestic abuse, addiction, and delays to health treatment. ""I feel that there have to be other approaches to this,"" he added. The Covid booster campaign started in September across all four nations of the UK Dr Salmon said it would be more efficient for people working in vaccination centres to try to prioritise vaccinating those over 60, or clinically at-risk groups who have not yet had their second Covid jab, rather than chasing younger people to get jabbed. ""Some 90,000 of those have not yet had their second Covid injections. Some even have not had their first,"" he said. ""It would be a much better use of our vaccinators' time to try and find and persuade these people to accept the vaccination, than chasing a lot of younger people, particularly 12 to 15-year-olds,"" he said. Between92.4% and 96.3% of those in age groups over 60in Wales have received two doses of vaccine. Dr Eilir Hughes, a GP on Anglesey, said it was important to encourage every eligible person to get vaccinated, without focussing on specific age groups. ""We should put the same effort into everyone. Whoever comes forward should be vaccinated. We should offer it to them,"" he said. ""Everyone can be a carrier, everyone can infect others. And that is what we are fighting here, we need to try and control it"" What could happen if Covid gets out of control? Figuring out Covid stats in Wales Office for National Statistics figures show that Covid accounted for 8.5% of all registered deaths in Wales, compared with with 6.6% of all deaths in England. There were 253 deaths in Septemberdueto Covid, out of 289 whichinvolvedCovid in Wales. It had been Wales' seventh leading cause of death in August. Heart disease and dementia were the two leading causes of death in Wales in September, with flu and pneumonia ranked eighth. It also found the mortality rate for deaths due to Covid in Wales last month was 89.6 deaths per 100,000 - significantly higher than the previous month and the highest rate since February. But there were three health board areas with September mortality rates higher than the Welsh average - 122.5 per 100,000 in Cwm Taf Morgannwg, 115.1 in Swansea Bay and 107.8 in Betsi Cadwaladr. There have been 7,267 deaths due to Covid in Wales over the 19 months. There have been 322,591 Covid booster jabs given out in Wales, according to Public Health Wales. Figures available for the first time show 58% of care home residents and more than 61% of healthcare workers have so far had a third dose of the vaccine. Nearly 47% of those over 80 have also had it and already more than a quarter of those in their 70s. Looking at the pace of the rollout in Wales, it appears that 59% of those eligible for a booster - six months and a week after their second dose - have had one so far in Wales. Dr Dai Samuel, consultant hepatologist at Cwm Taf Morgannwg University Health Board, described the situation in hospitals as ""extremely busy"". ""It feels like December and January time already,"" he said. ""That's the big concern really that we're going into this second winter, where everything is really up in the air at the moment."" He also said finding beds for patients was a ""big challenge"" in hospitals. Latest bed occupancy figures are more than 90% and Wednesday saw more patients in acute hospital beds than at any time over the pandemic. Dr Samuel said many feel the best capacity for occupied hospital beds would be 85-90%, whereas he said the health board's hospitals were ""always running"" at 95-99%. ""A few of my colleagues have already been off sick with burnout, I certainly feel pretty burned out myself,"" he added. Wales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan has pleaded with the Welsh public to ""play their part"" in keeping the virus at bay. ""As the head of the NHS has said, it's going to be the toughest winter ever in the history of the NHS,"" she said.

Scottish schools spending 'highest per pupil in UK',"Extra funding to deal with the coronavirus pandemic boosted the average spend in Scotland Scotland has the highest spending on schools per pupil of any UK nation, analysis has found. Teacher pay rises and extra Covid funding reversed spending cuts during the past decade, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said. Its research found spending per pupil in 2021-22 was estimated to be Â£7,600 per pupil - more than Â£800 higher than in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Spending between 2009-10 and 2014-15 fell by 7% in real terms. It then increased by the same percentage over the following five years. The biggest increase in the Scottish government's funding for schools was a 6% real terms rise in 2019-20, amounting to an additional Â£400 per pupil. This was driven by a 7% increase of teacher pay scales and a further backdated 3% rise. In England, total spending grew by 12% but coincided with a 13% rise in pupil numbers. Spending per pupil was lowest in Northern Ireland. The Scottish figures include extra Covid spending, not included for other nations, but the IFS said ""even after making plausible adjustments"", core spending per pupil was more than Â£800 higher in Scotland. Figures relate to total day-to-day school spending on children aged three to 19 by schools, local authorities and funding agencies. Luke Sibieta, author of the research at the IFS, said it was important to remember ""higher spending need not automatically translate into better educational outcomes"". He added: ""Indeed, international comparisons of test scores suggest numeracy and science scores were declining in high-spending Scotland relative to the OECD average up to 2018. ""It remains to be seen whether extra spending in Scotland since 2018 will arrest this trend."" Josh Hillman, director of education at the Nuffield Foundation that funded the study, said the IFS analysis showed the ""increasing divergence in education policy"" between the UK nations extended to school spending per pupil. He added: ""A major cause for concern is that funding for education recovery programmes in response to the pandemic is much lower across all four nations than those being implemented in comparable countries."" SNP MSP, and former teacher, Kaukab Stewart said the Scottish government's investment was ""paying off"". ""School buildings are in the best condition since records began, teacher numbers are higher than they've been since 2008, this year the number of Higher passes was at its highest since devolution, the number of Scottish students accepted to university is at a record high, and much more,"" she said. ""As we move out of the pandemic and into recovery, it is vital that our schools are put on a footing to continue to get the best for Scotland's young people."" Closing the ""poverty-related attainment gap"" was an SNP priority and a further Â£1bn would be invested in the Scottish Attainment Challenge during this parliament, she added.

Club rules may cause significant Covid rise - Long,"Robin Swann says the hospital system has consistently been operating above capacity Northern Ireland is ""facing into the most difficult winter ever experienced"", Robin Swann has warned. The health minister said there were ""unscheduled pressures"" facing the health and social care system. Earlier, Naomi Long said she feared relaxing rules on face coverings in nightclubs may cause a ""significant"" rise in the transmission of Covid-19. The justice minister said she was concerned about a ""lack of clarity"" in health advice. On Thursday,the executive agreed people will not need to wear masks while dancing in nightclubswhen they reopen next Sunday. Social distancing laws in hospitality venues will also be scrapped. However, Northern Ireland will not be followingEngland and Wales in easing rules around testing for Covid-19 after international travel. From Sunday,those returning to England will only be required to take a lateral flow testafter their arrival but those returning to Northern Ireland will still be required to pay for a more expensive PCR test. Any decision to move to lateral flow tests will require executive consideration and agreement. In a written ministerial statement on Friday, Mr Swann updated assembly members on the pressures facing the health service. ""Over this summer and into the autumn, the Northern Ireland hospital system has consistently been operating above capacity, with many patients waiting on trollies for admission,"" he said. ""This situation is unheard of during the summer months and is an indication of the scale of unscheduled pressures likely facing the HSC system this winter."" Mr Swann detailed funding he had assigned to help support the system, saying he had tabled a bid for an additional Â£30m from the October monitoring round to add to the Â£31.5m secured in the June round. Naomi Long said the impact on messaging around the wearing of face coverings could have ""potential unintended consequences"" It is understood Ms Long and Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon both raised concerns about the changes to Covid restrictions at Thursday's executive meeting. In a letter to her executive colleagues, obtained by BBC News NI, the justice minister warned that the impact on messaging around the wearing of face coverings could have ""potential unintended consequences"". She added: ""Given the extent of Covid transmission in the community, the risk posed by new variants and the high risk nature of nightclub settings, I fear that further relaxation in the wearing of face coverings, particularly when dancing, may lead to a significant increase in transmission."" Health service in NI facing 'worst winter ever' Ms Long said she recognised making changes to allow people to stand to eat or drink without masks was ""necessary"", but said that with such relaxations it would be ""practically impossible to maintain high levels"" of enforcement. The justice minister said she believed that as a result of the changes, it would be hard to justify ""continued requirements to wear masks in other lower risk settings as a consequence"". She also repeated her view that proof of full vaccination and testing should be ""mandatory"" requirements in high-risk environments such as nightclubs. Nightclubs are due to reopen in Northern Ireland on 31 October It is understood that work by Stormont's Department of Health on developing a vaccine passport digital system is ""well advanced"". But Ms Mallon has said the executive was told if ministers agree to make the scheme mandatory, it could take five to six weeks to put in place the legislation enforcing it. She said she was concerned that action from the executive would again be ""too little, too late"". ""We don't have five to six weeks, we need to be implementing it quickly so that when we need to, we can move on this,"" she said. ""I voted against reopening hospitality and nightclubs without mandatory passportsâ¦ we should have this in place, we know vaccines help to protect us. ""You need to ask other ministers why they don't share that viewpoint in the face of overwhelming evidence."" Irish press pause on some Covid-19 reopening plans Anger at clubs opening as maternity is restricted Dr David Farren, the chair of the British Medical Association's (BMA) Consultants Committee said the the Executive's decision is ""madness"". ""I was quoted earlier this week as saying that I haven't seen a health service as busy as this in my 20 years of practice. I stand by that,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Talkback. ""I don't care if people think we are scaremongering. The reason we are highlighting the data and the cases that are there at the minute is because we don't want to see this fall over. ""What happens if the health service gets overwhelmed, frankly, is that people will die."" This video can not be played BMA NI chairman Tom Black warns against easing restrictions further On Thursday, First Minister Paul Givan said Northern Ireland was going to be able to ""move forward"" with further easing. ""We continue to monitor the way in which transmission is spreading, but also the way in which it is spreading in hospitals,"" he said. ""But nobody wants to go back to what we had before. There are consequences with lockdown, people's mental health and cases of domestic violence that took place. ""Lockdown is not a solution without consequences - it has very serious consequences, and we all want to avoid that.""

Many people won't get care this winter - watchdog,"The report pays tribute to care workers' professionalism and resilience There will be ""a tsunami"" of people without the care they need this winter unless staff shortages are tackled, England's care watchdog is warning. Social care staff are ""exhausted and depleted,"" says Care Quality Commission (CQC) chief executive, Ian Trenholm. In a report, the CQC urges immediate work to address the problem of rising numbers of unfilled care sector jobs. On Thursday, the government announced an extra Â£162.5m to boost the adult social care workforce. This is in addition to Â£5.4bn earmarked for social care over the next three years from the government's health and social care levy, which already includes Â£500m to be spent on the workforce. The CQC welcomes the money but has a warning: ""It must be used to enable new ways of working that recognise the interdependency of all health and care settings, not just to prop up existing approaches and to plug demand in acute care."" Care staff shortage harming services, say managers Care staff shortages pile pressure on NHS Social care changes at-a-glance In its latest State of Health and Social Care in England report, the CQC confirms fears that social care providers are facing a staffing crisis, losing staff to better paid jobs in retail and hospitality, and unable to recruit replacements. Across England, numbers of unfilled jobs are rising month on month, the researchers found, from 6% in April to more than 10% in September. London is worst affected with 11% of jobs vacant, followed by the East Midlands at 9.4% and the South West at 9.2%. This means care providers are having to limit their services, the researchers found. This video can not be played Care minister Gillian Keegan: ""We want to get more hours in the system"" In Devon, Rebecca Marks, director of Ark Care Homes, says more than one in five of their beds are empty, because they cannot afford to staff them. She says current staff are exhausted after the pandemic, and despite the company offering funding for training and qualifications, and paying joining bonuses, ""they are saying: 'You know, I'm going to go and work in a supermarket'"". ""We need help and we need it fast... whether it's funding to be able to pay our staff higher wages to represent the responsibility and the amazing job that they do, or something different. ""It's a very difficult place for care providers and care staff, and ultimately our residents."" Oona Goldsworthy, who oversees five care homes in the south-west of England, told BBC Breakfast she was ""literally throwing everything"" at the problem to try and fill vacancies - including increasing wages. ""We have to recognise paying carers the minimum wage is just not acceptable any more,"" she said. By Alison Holt, social affairs editor In the measured tones of a regulator, this report makes it clear that a staffing crisis in the long overlooked care system has much broader consequences. A ""tsunami of unmet need"" is more than a striking phrase. It represents a lack of support that can leave someone who is disabled or in the later years of their life struggling - alone or with family, facing grinding daily difficulties and too often deterioration that ends in crisis. It is distressing for those at the heart of it and pressure on an overstretched NHS that with the right support might have been avoided. The extra money the government has announced will help, but councils and care organisations have been quick to say it won't be enough. And the suggestion it could lead to tens of thousands of new care staff is likely to be greeted with a wry smile coming just 18 months after the last government recruitment campaign failed to do that. Unpaid carers who look after relatives at home are among those hit hard by the staffing squeeze. Dorothy Cook cares for her husband Melvin, at home in Bristol. Melvin is in the advanced stages of a degenerative brain disease which has left him unable to wash, dress, shower or feed himself without her help. Dorothy Cook cares full-time for her husband Melvin Following a fall in February, he was in hospital for six weeks, and then spent four months in a rehabilitation unit. Melvin is meant to have a care package at home but the provider ended it after five weeks, as his condition was too complex for them to manage. That was 12 weeks ago, and Dorothy is struggling. ""It all falls on my shoulders, and I'm on my knees with exhaustion,"" she told the BBC. ""We both feel completely and utterly alone. We feel that nobody cares."" Carers UK, which represents unpaid people like Dorothy, saysa survey of 8,000 of its members,externalsuggests more than half (55%) have lost some or all of the support they need, since the pandemic. The government says it will take steps to ensure that unpaid carers have the support, advice and respite they need, with more detail to be published later this year. Care companies say the main factors making it hard to find and keep staff are: burnout from the pandemic compulsory vaccinations in care homes higher pay available in other sectors as the economy picks up post-Brexit immigration rule changes In its report, the CQC pays tribute ""to the professionalism and resilience of everyone that works in social care"", but according to chief executive Ian Trenholm: ""Those people cannot be expected to work any harder. ""If we're to get safely through this winter, there needs to be urgent action."" He says local leaders of health and social care services will need ""to make maximum use of everything they have at their disposal to get safely through the winter... If these things don't happen there is the genuine risk of a tsunami of unmet need, with many people not getting the care that they so desperately need this winter."" He believes the key is more collaboration between services and urges a rapid overhaul: ""We can't be in this position in a year's time. We need to be thinking about what systems will look like in the future. ""We are really clear, there are no silver bullets, there are no simple answers to what is a very, very complex problem."" A Department of Health and Social Care official said: ""We appreciate the dedication and tireless work of health and social care staff throughout the pandemic. ""We have provided record levels of investment to support them and will provide Â£36bn over the next three years for health and social care across the UK. ""We are working on health and social care reform to ensure we can provide world-leading services and are committed to learning lessons from the pandemic, with a full public inquiry in the spring."" Shadow minister for social care, Liz Kendall, called the report ""devastating"", saying the government's recentsocial care announcementwould not help. ""Labour is calling for a ten-year plan of investment and reform,"" to include a new deal to transform pay, training and conditions for care staff, and a shift in focus towards prevention and early intervention, said Ms Kendall.

Earlier this month, she spent a night in hospital for some medical investigations - her first overnight hospital stay in eight years. But that followed a particularly busy few weeks of public engagements across the UK for the 95-year-old monarch. The Queen began the month at her Balmoral Estate in Scotland, where she helped to plant a tree with the Prince of Wales. The pair were promoting their campaign urging people across the UK to plant a tree ahead of the Platinum Jubilee next year. She and Prince Charles met primary school children during the event.

It was the first time she had attended the ceremony without Prince Philip, who died this year aged 99. During her speech, she spoke of her deep affection for Scotland. A few days later, the Queen held audiences with diplomats from Belize and Greece over video call. The same day, she met members of the Canadian Army at Windsor Castle at an event to mark the 150th anniversary of the A and B batteries of the Royal Regiment of Canadian Artillery.

"Queen back at Windsor after hospital stayShe is ""in good spirits"" after a one-night stay for preliminary medical checks, Buckingham Palace says.UK","The Queen spent Wednesday night in hospital for preliminary medical checks and is now back at Windsor Castle, Buckingham Palace has said. The 95-year-old monarch returned from the private hospital in central London at lunchtime on Thursday and is ""in good spirits"", the palace added. The Queen had cancelled a visit to Northern Ireland on Wednesday. She was given medical advice to rest for a few days aftera busy schedule of public engagements. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said ""everybody sends Her Majesty our very very best wishes"". He added he was ""given to understand that actually Her Majesty is characteristically back at her desk at Windsor as we speak"". In a statement on Thursday night, Buckingham Palace said: ""Following medical advice to rest for a few days, the Queen attended hospital on Wednesday afternoon for some preliminary investigations, returning to Windsor Castle at lunchtime today, and remains in good spirits."" In pictures: The Queen's busy October schedule Royal Family tree Queen cancels Northern Ireland trip on medical advice Queen declines Oldie of the Year award The Queen travelled by car to the King Edward VII's Hospital in Marylebone, about 19 miles (32km) from Windsor, where she was seen by specialists. Her admittance is understood not to be related to coronavirus. The overnight stay was said to be for practical reasons and the Queen was undertaking light duties back at Windsor on Thursday afternoon. It is the first time the Queen has stayed in hospital since 2013, when she suffered symptoms of gastroenteritis. The King Edward VII's is a private hospital used by senior royals - including the Queen's husband, the late Duke of Edinburgh, who received treatment there earlier this year. The news on Wednesday that the Queen would have to cancel a trip to Northern Ireland was always going to cause concern. Despite looking very well and happy at the numerous events she has attended over the past week, it cannot be forgotten that she is 95 years old. It is a tricky balance for the palace to release enough details about the Queen's health to keep the public informed while maintaining the privacy to which she is entitled. It was for this reason that the news that she had been taken to hospital for tests was not announced, until a report on the Sun newspaper's front page forced the palace's hand. People will be concerned, but the reassuring guidance remains that she is in ""good spirits"" on her return from hospital and is well enough to undertake some light duties. It has been a busy period of official engagements for the Queen. An official record of the Queen's diary showed at least 16 formal events during October, and there had been the plans for her to embark on the two-day trip to Northern Ireland this week. She was pictured hosting a Global Investment Summit at Windsor Castle on Tuesday evening alongside Mr Johnson. However, on Wednesday a Buckingham Palace spokesman said the monarch had ""reluctantly accepted medical advice to rest for the next few days"". He said the Queen was ""disappointed that she will no longer be able to visit Northern Ireland"" - which would have involved an overnight stay. The Queen began the month in Scotland, planting a tree with the Prince of Wales at the Balmoral Estate on1 Octoberandattending the opening of the sixth session of the Scottish Parliamentin Edinburghthe following day. Prince Charles, known as the Duke of Rothesay when in Scotland, planted a tree with his mother to launch a tree-planting initiative The following week, she met members of the Canadian military at Windsor Castle on6 Octoberand attended the launch of the Commonwealth Games baton relay at Buckingham Palace on7 October. Last week, on12 October, she attended a church service to mark the centenary of The Royal British Legion at Westminster Abbey. She then travelled to Wales toopen the sixth term of the SeneddonThursday. BySaturdayshe was back in England - attending Champions Day at Ascot racecourse in Berkshire. And onTuesday eveningshe was back at Windsor Castle hosting the Global Investment Summit. The Queen was pictured alongside Prime Minister Boris Johnson on Tuesday The Queen is expected to lead a royal delegation to the Glasgow COP26 climate change summit in two weeks' time. In reported remarks overheard at an event last week, sheappeared to suggest she was irritatedby people who ""talk"" but ""don't do"" when it came to protecting the environment. Earlier this week, the Queen declined a magazine's award of Oldie of the Year,saying ""you are only as old as you feel"". She ""politely but firmly"" turned down the award, but sent the Oldie magazine a message with her ""warmest best wishes"".

Here are the day's main Covid headlines:  Today's live page was written by Joseph Lee, Malu Cursino and Doug Faulkner. It was edited by Hamish Mackay. Daily reported Covid cases in Belgium have reached their highest level in almost a year, after a 60% rise over the previous week. On Friday, the country recorded almost 6,500 cases - as many as in November last year, just before the government ordered a second lockdown. However, the infection rate is still below the country's peak in mid-October of last year, when cases were running at 15,000 a day, contributing to Belgium having one of the world's highest per-capita death rates from Covid. But with 87% of the eligible population vaccinated, Belgium's coronavirus commissioner says vaccines are preventing 70% of infections and 90% of hospital admissions. Elsewhere in Europe, Germany has recorded a 70% week-on-week rise in infections, with 19,572 reported on Friday. And as we mentioned earlier, Poland has seen its case numbers rise by 106% in a week. This video can not be played 'Russia's Covid mortality rate similar to WWII' - epidemiologist Dr Vasily Vlassov, an epidemiologist at HSE University, says there is ""definitely"" a Covid crisis in Russia and says that the level of mortality may be similar to that seen during World War Two. He adds that Russia's true daily death toll may be double the ""optimistic"" official figures. Vladimir Putin has told people to stay away from their workplace for a week at the start of November in a bid to slow the spread of the virus. Covid infections in the UK are up 17.9% over the past week,
with 52,009 cases reported yesterday and a further 49,298 today. The rise in infections has led to an increase in
the reproduction value - orR number- from
between 0.9 and 1.1, to 1.0 and 1.2. in England. That means for
every 10 people who have Covid, a further 10 to 12 people will become
infected. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

Lucy Wightman, director of public health for Northamptonshire, says the countyhas ""got to make sure we're using all of the tools in the box"". ""Vaccination is great but it's not a silver bullet,"" she says. A further 763 cases of Covid-19 have been recorded in the county in the latest 24-hour period. ""We need people to be getting all of their doses of the vaccination including the booster when they're eligible,"" she says. ""But that doesn't negate the need for us to still be testing on a regular basis, to still be using face coverings in crowded spaces and for us to be social distancing where we can, think about who we're mixing with on a regular basis and just basic things like handwashing."" This video can not be played Covid-19: BMA NI chairman Tom Black warns against easing restrictions further Dr Tom Black, chairman of the British Medical Association (BMA) in Northern Ireland, says further easing of restrictions in NI is ""madness"" and ""stupid"". On Thursday,the executive agreed people will not need to wear masks while dancing in nightclubswhen they reopen next Sunday. Health minister Robin Swann has warned thatNorthern Ireland is ""facing into the most difficult winter ever experienced"". Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst The pandemic has triggered Chinese tourism companies into exploring new ways of making money, with online sightseeing trips becoming increasingly popular. The national China Daily newspaper notes that in the last year, popular travel agencies like Qunar have teamed up with theme parks and drone companies to offer livestreaming shows to consumers. In the past 18 months, the paper says ânearly 10 million of its users [have] joined a livestreaming show to enjoy beautiful views via dronesâ of sites such as the Forbidden City or Mount Emei, a mountain sacred in Buddhism. While some companies say this kind of travel can simply be a supplement to in-person travelling, there is a recognition in Chinaâs media that strict Covid-19 controls have left people starved of travel. Tourist sites and companies have often been the first to feel the brunt of Covid-19 controls. When cases of the virus are directed in cities, flights are often immediately suspended, and large-scale venues either significantly reduce their capacity, or close. There have been a further 180 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test across the UK. It takes the total number who have died by that measure to 139,146. The most recent figures also show there are 8,238 patients with Covid in hospitals across the country. A further 48,732 people received a first dose of vaccine on Thursday, while 26,828 received a second dose. A further 49,298 coronavirus cases have been reported across the UK. It marks the 10th consecutive day new cases have been above 40,000. Health Secretary Sajid Javid previously warned daily cases could reach 100,000 a day in the coming months. Two schools in Herefordshire have closed early for half-term
due to a spike in Covid cases. Both Lady Hawkins High School in Kington and Eardisley
Primary School are shut today, allowing for a 10-day âfire breakâ. The schools
will reopen on Monday 1 November. In addition to this, the head teacher at Lady Hawkins, Paul
Jennings, says the school has increased cleaning and reintroduced face masks in
classes. According to the ONS, one in 13 children in school years 7 to 11 tested
positive for Covid last week. Jennings adds: âWe have taken the decision to close for half-term on Thursday 21 October, which is only a day early, but allows everyone 10
full days away from school, to act as a 'fire break' in transmission."" You can read more on this story here. Weâve been asking for your views on whether, amid rising
cases, the government should turn to its âPlan Bâ for winter. Plan B would
include the reintroduction of some social distancing measures and mandatory
mask-wearing in certain circumstances. Mark from Nottingham - who is clinically extremely vulnerable - shared with us why he believes the government
should turn to Plan B for winter. He recently had a hospital appointment and had to commute by bus to
attend the appointment. He says the journey there and back âinvolved four different
busesâ and three of the buses âwere almost fullâ. He says he was âshocked to
see that only two or three passengers were wearing masks or face coveringsâ. Due to his circumstances, Mark says he feels like he is
playing âRussian rouletteâ every time he takes the bus. Mark urges the government to reintroduce mandatory
mask-wearing on public transport, adding the ""slightest infringement"" of a face covering is ""far outweighed by the benefit it
would achieveâ. You can read more about what ""Plan B"" is here. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online A new mutated form of coronavirus that some are calling ""Delta Plus"" may spread more easily than regular Delta, UK experts now say. The UK Health Security Agency has moved it up into the ""variant under investigation"" category, to reflect this possible risk. There is no evidence yet that it causes worse illness. And scientists are confident that existing vaccines should still work well to protect people. Read the full story here. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst There have been 28 symptomatic cases of Covid-19 in the last 24 hours in China. Although by international standards this figure might seem relatively small, these cases span seven provincial-level regions, igniting concerns that China is on the cusp of a large-scale winter outbreak. Four regions have now introduced lockdowns: Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Guizhou and the capital, Beijing. China has a zero-Covid strategy, and immediately locks down communities when new cases are confirmed, to prevent transmission. Large-scale testing drives are also ordered, and millions of people are tested for Covid-19 often within two or three days. More than 70% of Chinaâs population has been fully vaccinated, and there are projections that China will have fully vaccinated more than 80% of the population by the end of the year. Nevertheless, there is still a lot of caution. Booster jabs are currently being rolled out in many major cities, and the Wuhan marathon, which was set to take place this Sunday, has now been postponed - even though there are currently no cases in the city. Boris Johnson says there is ""nothing to indicate"" that a full lockdown with a ""stay at home"" order is on the cards this winter. He says: ""I've got to tell you at the moment that we see absolutely nothing to indicate that that's on the cards at all."" The prime minister's visit to the vaccine centre lasted about 40 minutes. He spoke with staff and members of the public, greeting people with elbow bumps. Johnson, who was wearing a mask, also spoke to two pharmacists who were preparing vaccine doses. We've got more from the prime minister, who is at a vccination centre in west London. Asked if he is ignoring advice from government scientists about working from home, Boris Johnson says ministers keep measures under constant review and ""we do whatever we have to do to protect the public"". ""What we want people to do is to come forward and get their jabs,"" he says. ""We also want young people, we want kids at school, to be getting their jabs. ""There'll be booking systems opening from tomorrow in addition to the vaccination programme in schools."" He adds it is ""important"" people get a booster jab because ""the double vaccination provides a lot of protection against serious illness and death but it doesn't protect you against catching the disease, and it doesn't protect you against passing it on"". ""So now is the time to get your booster,"" he says. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says that the government's autumn and winter plan ""always predicted that cases would rise around about now"". Speaking during a visit to a Covid vaccination centre in west London, he says we are seeing ""high levels of infection"" but they are not outside the parameters of what was predicted. ""But it's very important that people do follow the guidance on general behaviour,"" he says. ""Wear a mask, wash hands, ventilation, all that kind of thing, but also get your booster jab, and that's the key message that we want to get across."" The PM says the booster programme has been planned for this time of year because ""there is some evidence, obviously, that the vaccines start to wane"" - but adds that a new study suggests a booster offers ""very, very good protection"". An estimated 5.3 million booster doses of Covid-19 vaccine have been delivered in the UK, new figures show. It is the first time data on boosters has been reported by all four nations. There have been: It means around one in nine people in the UK who have received a first and second dose of vaccine are likely to have also received a booster. The figures have been published by NHS England, Public Health Scotland, Public Health Wales and the Northern Ireland Department of Health. The figure for England includes a small number of third primary doses of vaccine, NHS England says. The government hasfaced calls this week to introduce its Covid winter Plan Bamid rising case numbers. So far the government has resisted moving from Plan A - which involves encouraging the take up of booster shots and lateral flow tests. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies says the government needs to prepare to put Plan B measures - such as stricter face mask rules and greater social distancing - in place. As you can see from the graph below, the percentage of people practising basic Covid prevention measures has fallen. And the proportion of people working exclusively from home has also fallen after the country eased restrictions. Sage says that advising people to work from home could have the greatest impact on stopping the virus spreading. The NHS in Lanarkshire hasmoved to its highest risk levelas all three of its hospitals have reached maximum capacity. The military is already providing additional support at University hospitals Hairmyres, Monklands and Wishaw. But the health board describes occupancy levels as ""critical"" and says the ""sustained pressure"" shows no signs of easing. It also confirms some elective cancer procedures have been cancelled. Deputy chief executive Laura Ace says the area is facing  ""relentless pressures, bed shortages and staff shortages due to sickness, stress and self-isolation"". Earlier this week,NHS Grampianbecame the latest Scottish health board to ask for military help amid the pandemic, after NHS Lanarkshire and NHS Borders. Richard GalpinBBC World Affairs reporter Near the darkened entrance of Hospital Number One in the city of Vologda in Russia's north-west, an ambulance crew delivers yet another Covid patient, an elderly man struggling to breathe and barely alive. Inside the hospital, the wards are teeming with the sick and the dying. Doctors here say out of 750 patients currently in the hospital with Covid, 700 of them had not been vaccinated. Across the country, more than 1,000 people are dying each day, with a total of more than 220,000 deaths so far. These are record numbers for Russia, the worst-hit in Europe. One of the key explanations for this record number of cases and deaths is a lack of trust in the Sputnik V and other Russian-made coronavirus vaccines among many in the population. This, in part, is the result of many years of scepticism of what the authorities say or do. In Vologda just 26% of the population has been vaccinated, one of the lowest levels in the country.

Give every household Â£320 for energy costs - GreensThe Green Party of England and Wales says the Â£9bn plan could be paid for with a tax on landlords.,"This video can not be played Green Party co-leader Carla Denyer: There is nowhere Green Party can't win Every household should be given Â£320 to help with ""spiralling energy bills"", the Green Party of England and Wales have said at the start of their annual conference in Birmingham. In a speech, the party's new leaders said the Â£9bn plan could be paid for with a windfall tax on all landlords of private rented properties. Co-leader Adrian Ramsay argued this could help people avoid fuel poverty. The policy announcement comes amid energy price rises. Earlier this month, around 15 million households saw their bills climb by 12%, as the energy cap was raised. The energy regulator Ofgem has warned that the cap will go up again next April. Why are gas prices so high? France to pay 38m citizens â¬100 each to ease costs New Green leaders focus on power not protests Addressing Green Party activists in Birmingham, Mr Ramsay said their proposal was ""about keeping people safe"". ""It's about the state responding to market failure, it's about human dignity. ""Our proposal is what government should be doing to show leadership - it's an issue which shows how climate justice and social justice go hand in hand."" The party says it also wants to introduce a Green New Deal programme, spending Â£100bn on getting the UK to net zero carbon emissions by 2030 through insulation schemes and renewable energy. By Political Correspondent Ione Wells The Green Party have reasons to be optimistic - they have a record number of councillors, their sister party is in power in the Scottish government, and they're feeling positive about their polling. Rising energy bills and COP26 have got all parties talking about the need to move away from relying on fossil fuels too. But they still have only one MP, Caroline Lucas, in Parliament. And more radical green groups like Extinction Rebellion and Insulate Britain - who the new leaders have actively distanced themselves from - have been making more front pages than the party in the last few months. The new leaders are adamant they want to be seen as a party not a pressure group - but with every major party now trumpeting green policies, standing out is a key challenge. Mr Ramsay delivered the speech jointly with co-leader Carla Denyer, a Bristol city councillor. She said people had ""grown tired of choosing the 'least worst' option, of being patronised, ignored and told what to think"". ""We are tired of a Tory government playing divide and rule, tired of out of touch policies which ride roughshod over people, tired of politics which amount to little more than an old boys' club serving the interests of its pals,"" she added. And she accused Labour of failing the public and failing to ""take a stand on the biggest issues of the day"". Ms Denyer, a former engineer, said the Greens were committed to a pay rise for key workers, a universal basic income and ending the sale of arms to ""oppressive regimes"". Setting out her party's strategy, she told the conference the Greens could ""win elections in every corner of England and Wales...  there is nowhere we can't win"". Caroline Lucas is the Green Party's only MP in Westminster Mr Ramsay said he wanted to be part of the team that ""gets our second MP elected, and our fourth and our fifth"". The pair concluded their speech by telling the audience this was ""the last chance for serious climate action"" and that ""we and only we have what it takes"". The Greens are in government in Scotland with the SNP, but their sister party in England and Wales remains a minor voice at Westminster with just one MP. However they have had more success at the local level winning 80 more council seats during elections earlier this year. They currently hold 447 seats on 141 different councils.

Here are the day's main Covid headlines:  Today's live page was written by Joseph Lee, Malu Cursino and Doug Faulkner. It was edited by Hamish Mackay. Daily reported Covid cases in Belgium have reached their highest level in almost a year, after a 60% rise over the previous week. On Friday, the country recorded almost 6,500 cases - as many as in November last year, just before the government ordered a second lockdown. However, the infection rate is still below the country's peak in mid-October of last year, when cases were running at 15,000 a day, contributing to Belgium having one of the world's highest per-capita death rates from Covid. But with 87% of the eligible population vaccinated, Belgium's coronavirus commissioner says vaccines are preventing 70% of infections and 90% of hospital admissions. Elsewhere in Europe, Germany has recorded a 70% week-on-week rise in infections, with 19,572 reported on Friday. And as we mentioned earlier, Poland has seen its case numbers rise by 106% in a week. This video can not be played 'Russia's Covid mortality rate similar to WWII' - epidemiologist Dr Vasily Vlassov, an epidemiologist at HSE University, says there is ""definitely"" a Covid crisis in Russia and says that the level of mortality may be similar to that seen during World War Two. He adds that Russia's true daily death toll may be double the ""optimistic"" official figures. Vladimir Putin has told people to stay away from their workplace for a week at the start of November in a bid to slow the spread of the virus. Covid infections in the UK are up 17.9% over the past week,
with 52,009 cases reported yesterday and a further 49,298 today. The rise in infections has led to an increase in
the reproduction value - orR number- from
between 0.9 and 1.1, to 1.0 and 1.2. in England. That means for
every 10 people who have Covid, a further 10 to 12 people will become
infected. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

Lucy Wightman, director of public health for Northamptonshire, says the countyhas ""got to make sure we're using all of the tools in the box"". ""Vaccination is great but it's not a silver bullet,"" she says. A further 763 cases of Covid-19 have been recorded in the county in the latest 24-hour period. ""We need people to be getting all of their doses of the vaccination including the booster when they're eligible,"" she says. ""But that doesn't negate the need for us to still be testing on a regular basis, to still be using face coverings in crowded spaces and for us to be social distancing where we can, think about who we're mixing with on a regular basis and just basic things like handwashing."" This video can not be played Covid-19: BMA NI chairman Tom Black warns against easing restrictions further Dr Tom Black, chairman of the British Medical Association (BMA) in Northern Ireland, says further easing of restrictions in NI is ""madness"" and ""stupid"". On Thursday,the executive agreed people will not need to wear masks while dancing in nightclubswhen they reopen next Sunday. Health minister Robin Swann has warned thatNorthern Ireland is ""facing into the most difficult winter ever experienced"". Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst The pandemic has triggered Chinese tourism companies into exploring new ways of making money, with online sightseeing trips becoming increasingly popular. The national China Daily newspaper notes that in the last year, popular travel agencies like Qunar have teamed up with theme parks and drone companies to offer livestreaming shows to consumers. In the past 18 months, the paper says ânearly 10 million of its users [have] joined a livestreaming show to enjoy beautiful views via dronesâ of sites such as the Forbidden City or Mount Emei, a mountain sacred in Buddhism. While some companies say this kind of travel can simply be a supplement to in-person travelling, there is a recognition in Chinaâs media that strict Covid-19 controls have left people starved of travel. Tourist sites and companies have often been the first to feel the brunt of Covid-19 controls. When cases of the virus are directed in cities, flights are often immediately suspended, and large-scale venues either significantly reduce their capacity, or close. There have been a further 180 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test across the UK. It takes the total number who have died by that measure to 139,146. The most recent figures also show there are 8,238 patients with Covid in hospitals across the country. A further 48,732 people received a first dose of vaccine on Thursday, while 26,828 received a second dose. A further 49,298 coronavirus cases have been reported across the UK. It marks the 10th consecutive day new cases have been above 40,000. Health Secretary Sajid Javid previously warned daily cases could reach 100,000 a day in the coming months. Two schools in Herefordshire have closed early for half-term
due to a spike in Covid cases. Both Lady Hawkins High School in Kington and Eardisley
Primary School are shut today, allowing for a 10-day âfire breakâ. The schools
will reopen on Monday 1 November. In addition to this, the head teacher at Lady Hawkins, Paul
Jennings, says the school has increased cleaning and reintroduced face masks in
classes. According to the ONS, one in 13 children in school years 7 to 11 tested
positive for Covid last week. Jennings adds: âWe have taken the decision to close for half-term on Thursday 21 October, which is only a day early, but allows everyone 10
full days away from school, to act as a 'fire break' in transmission."" You can read more on this story here. Weâve been asking for your views on whether, amid rising
cases, the government should turn to its âPlan Bâ for winter. Plan B would
include the reintroduction of some social distancing measures and mandatory
mask-wearing in certain circumstances. Mark from Nottingham - who is clinically extremely vulnerable - shared with us why he believes the government
should turn to Plan B for winter. He recently had a hospital appointment and had to commute by bus to
attend the appointment. He says the journey there and back âinvolved four different
busesâ and three of the buses âwere almost fullâ. He says he was âshocked to
see that only two or three passengers were wearing masks or face coveringsâ. Due to his circumstances, Mark says he feels like he is
playing âRussian rouletteâ every time he takes the bus. Mark urges the government to reintroduce mandatory
mask-wearing on public transport, adding the ""slightest infringement"" of a face covering is ""far outweighed by the benefit it
would achieveâ. You can read more about what ""Plan B"" is here. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online A new mutated form of coronavirus that some are calling ""Delta Plus"" may spread more easily than regular Delta, UK experts now say. The UK Health Security Agency has moved it up into the ""variant under investigation"" category, to reflect this possible risk. There is no evidence yet that it causes worse illness. And scientists are confident that existing vaccines should still work well to protect people. Read the full story here. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst There have been 28 symptomatic cases of Covid-19 in the last 24 hours in China. Although by international standards this figure might seem relatively small, these cases span seven provincial-level regions, igniting concerns that China is on the cusp of a large-scale winter outbreak. Four regions have now introduced lockdowns: Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Guizhou and the capital, Beijing. China has a zero-Covid strategy, and immediately locks down communities when new cases are confirmed, to prevent transmission. Large-scale testing drives are also ordered, and millions of people are tested for Covid-19 often within two or three days. More than 70% of Chinaâs population has been fully vaccinated, and there are projections that China will have fully vaccinated more than 80% of the population by the end of the year. Nevertheless, there is still a lot of caution. Booster jabs are currently being rolled out in many major cities, and the Wuhan marathon, which was set to take place this Sunday, has now been postponed - even though there are currently no cases in the city. Boris Johnson says there is ""nothing to indicate"" that a full lockdown with a ""stay at home"" order is on the cards this winter. He says: ""I've got to tell you at the moment that we see absolutely nothing to indicate that that's on the cards at all."" The prime minister's visit to the vaccine centre lasted about 40 minutes. He spoke with staff and members of the public, greeting people with elbow bumps. Johnson, who was wearing a mask, also spoke to two pharmacists who were preparing vaccine doses. We've got more from the prime minister, who is at a vccination centre in west London. Asked if he is ignoring advice from government scientists about working from home, Boris Johnson says ministers keep measures under constant review and ""we do whatever we have to do to protect the public"". ""What we want people to do is to come forward and get their jabs,"" he says. ""We also want young people, we want kids at school, to be getting their jabs. ""There'll be booking systems opening from tomorrow in addition to the vaccination programme in schools."" He adds it is ""important"" people get a booster jab because ""the double vaccination provides a lot of protection against serious illness and death but it doesn't protect you against catching the disease, and it doesn't protect you against passing it on"". ""So now is the time to get your booster,"" he says. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says that the government's autumn and winter plan ""always predicted that cases would rise around about now"". Speaking during a visit to a Covid vaccination centre in west London, he says we are seeing ""high levels of infection"" but they are not outside the parameters of what was predicted. ""But it's very important that people do follow the guidance on general behaviour,"" he says. ""Wear a mask, wash hands, ventilation, all that kind of thing, but also get your booster jab, and that's the key message that we want to get across."" The PM says the booster programme has been planned for this time of year because ""there is some evidence, obviously, that the vaccines start to wane"" - but adds that a new study suggests a booster offers ""very, very good protection"". An estimated 5.3 million booster doses of Covid-19 vaccine have been delivered in the UK, new figures show. It is the first time data on boosters has been reported by all four nations. There have been: It means around one in nine people in the UK who have received a first and second dose of vaccine are likely to have also received a booster. The figures have been published by NHS England, Public Health Scotland, Public Health Wales and the Northern Ireland Department of Health. The figure for England includes a small number of third primary doses of vaccine, NHS England says. The government hasfaced calls this week to introduce its Covid winter Plan Bamid rising case numbers. So far the government has resisted moving from Plan A - which involves encouraging the take up of booster shots and lateral flow tests. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies says the government needs to prepare to put Plan B measures - such as stricter face mask rules and greater social distancing - in place. As you can see from the graph below, the percentage of people practising basic Covid prevention measures has fallen. And the proportion of people working exclusively from home has also fallen after the country eased restrictions. Sage says that advising people to work from home could have the greatest impact on stopping the virus spreading. The NHS in Lanarkshire hasmoved to its highest risk levelas all three of its hospitals have reached maximum capacity. The military is already providing additional support at University hospitals Hairmyres, Monklands and Wishaw. But the health board describes occupancy levels as ""critical"" and says the ""sustained pressure"" shows no signs of easing. It also confirms some elective cancer procedures have been cancelled. Deputy chief executive Laura Ace says the area is facing  ""relentless pressures, bed shortages and staff shortages due to sickness, stress and self-isolation"". Earlier this week,NHS Grampianbecame the latest Scottish health board to ask for military help amid the pandemic, after NHS Lanarkshire and NHS Borders. Richard GalpinBBC World Affairs reporter Near the darkened entrance of Hospital Number One in the city of Vologda in Russia's north-west, an ambulance crew delivers yet another Covid patient, an elderly man struggling to breathe and barely alive. Inside the hospital, the wards are teeming with the sick and the dying. Doctors here say out of 750 patients currently in the hospital with Covid, 700 of them had not been vaccinated. Across the country, more than 1,000 people are dying each day, with a total of more than 220,000 deaths so far. These are record numbers for Russia, the worst-hit in Europe. One of the key explanations for this record number of cases and deaths is a lack of trust in the Sputnik V and other Russian-made coronavirus vaccines among many in the population. This, in part, is the result of many years of scepticism of what the authorities say or do. In Vologda just 26% of the population has been vaccinated, one of the lowest levels in the country.

Southend falls silent to remember Sir David AmessConservative MP Sir David was stabbed to death at a constituency surgery a week ago.,"People gathered on the streets of Southend to pay their respects to Sir David, who had been an MP in Essex since 1983 Southend has remembered Sir David Amess, a week after he was killed at a constituency surgery. Sir David, 69, wasstabbed to deathshortly after midday last Friday, in Leigh-on-Sea, Essex. Residents and shopkeepers bowed their heads in silence, broken by applause and the release of blue balloons in memory of the Southend West MP. Ali Harbi Ali, 25, isdue at the Old Baileycharged with murder and preparing terrorist acts. People on Eastwood Road released blue balloons at the end of the silence Amess replacement must be from area, insist locals 'I keep crying over David's dream come true' The lesser-known concerns of Sir David Amess James Duddridge, the MP for Rochford and Southend East, said: ""It is going to be very difficult not just for the family but for the whole community."" After the silence, he told mourners: ""Speaking to Jo Cox's family, it took them a long time to recover and we must spend time together as a community and not be afraid to cry and share a cuddle, share a story, to share a funny story as well as a sensible story. ""I think that is one of the things that the Cox family said was really important - to remember a person and spend time together as a community. Southend was granted city status in honour of Sir David, who had lobbied for the title for more than 20 years. Ian Gilbert, leader of Southend Borough Council, said heartwarming stories of Sir David were shared at an ""emotional"" full council meeting on Thursday night. Sir David Amess had campaigned for Southend to be a city for more than 20 years ""Pretty much everybody who has lived in Southend for some time has a story to share about him, he was part of the fabric of the town and touched many, many people,"" he said. ""I've been heartened by the way the community, quite spontaneously, has come together to support one another at this difficult time. ""I hope the honour of being accorded city status, which is something Sir David campaigned on tirelessly for many years, will be something that can help bring the community together and honour his memory."" Father Jeffrey Woolnough (left), who had attempted to administer last rites to his friend Sir David, was among those gathered in Leigh-on-Sea The silence was organised by local businesses who wanted to pay their respects A week ago, Sir David was meeting constituents, as he loved to do, at Belfairs Methodist Church. He'd been chatting and laughing with locals outside the church before he was killed. He died as he had lived, serving people, for nearly 40 years. He had known five prime ministers. So many people I have met in the past few days have stories of how he had helped them. So many here considered him a friend. This silence is the idea of businesses from the Belfairs area. There is a parade of shops here where he was so well known, just as he was across the town and the borough, and beyond. There is sadness, and a deep shared sympathy with Sir David's wife and children. People in Leigh-on Sea have been remembering Sir David Among those gathered was Father Jeffrey Woolnough, who had rushed to the church when he heard that Sir David, a devout Catholic, had been stabbed in the hope of giving him the last rites. He was unable to deliver the sacrament as the area had become a crime scene. He said Sir David spoke to people from all parties, races and religions, and ""it was such a great gift and it was tireless because it was sincere"". Butcher Tony Phillips, who closed up his shop for the tribute, said: ""We are all just so very sad that he is no longer with us. ""We used to see him quite regularly. He used to come in to the shop every now and then to see if we had any problems. He will be sadly missed."" Estate agent Rob Cooke said: ""Sir David was very much part of the community and obviously we are just gutted with what has happened. I just wanted to pay my respects and to think about him and his family. ""I think it is going to take quite a long time for the community to recover from what has happened.""

UK shop sales continue to fall in September,"Retail sales fell for the fifth month in a row in September, with people spending less in shops despite Covid restrictions easing in the summer. Sales dipped by 0.2% in September, following a 0.6% drop in August, according to the Office for National Statistics (ONS). Non-food stores were hit hardest by the decline in sales, with customers buying fewer household goods and furniture. In contrast, fuel sales rose by 2.9%, pushed up by a spike in demand. Darren Morgan, director of economic statistics at the ONS, said: ""Household goods were the main driver of this month's decline, with a fall of nearly 10%, while food sales ticked back up after falling last month."" He added that petrol sales exceeded their pre-pandemic levels for the first time in September. Petrol stations reported strong sales during the last week of the month after warnings over delivery problems due to a shortage of lorry drivers. Despite coronavirus-related restrictions being lifted in the summer, shopping in-store remained subdued. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the British Retail Consortium (BRC), said that shop owners would be ""concerned"" by the slump in sales in the run-up to the key Christmas trading period. ""For the sake of the UK's economic recovery, it is vital that retail sales bounce back as we near the festive season,"" she said. She added that labour shortages across supply chains, warehouses, and factories were all putting pressure on retailers ahead of the festive season. PG Tips and Cornetto maker warns prices will rise Why Christmas may be stuck in a shipping container Toy shops warn of Christmas shortages amid delays The proportion of online sales, however, rose to 28.1% in September, from 27.9% the month before - substantially higher than pre-pandemic levels. Department stores also reported an increase in sales of 4.3%. Tony Brown, chief executive of New Start 2020, which owns Beales department stores, told the BBC's Today programme that people's shopping habits had changed since restrictions had eased. ""There is not much browsing anymore - people come out, they know what they want, they spend and then they go. It is a different dynamic than what it used to be,"" he said. The retailer also warned of a ""perfect storm"", saying that high shipping costs, additional customs checks because of Brexit, inflation and the cost of fuel increasing meant that additional costs had to be passed on to customers. Bethany Beckett, UK economist at Capital Economics, said the latest figures suggested the ""economic recovery is fast running out of steam"". The fifth monthly fall in sales in September marks the longest continuous drop since records began in 1996, although they remain about pre-pandemic levels. But Ms Beckett added: ""Given the backdrop of continued shortages and rising Covid-19 infections, we suspect that retail sales growth will continue to be weak in the coming months."" In the run-up to Chancellor Rishi Sunak's Budget next week, trade organisations recently called for additional support. The BRC, in a joint letter also signed by the CBI and UK Hospitality, called for the reform of business rates charged on non-domestic properties, saying that businesses needed help to rebuild after Covid.

France to pay 38m citizens â¬100 each to ease costs,"Many French citizens are struggling with record prices at the pump The French government has announced a one-off payment of â¬100 (Â£84; $116) for each citizen whose monthly net income is â¬2,000 or less, to help counter the surge in fuel and energy prices. The ""inflation allowance"" will go to about 38 million French people automatically, including those who do not drive a car or ride a motorbike. The first payments will go to business employees in late December. Civil servants, students and pensioners will get theirs in early 2022. The â¬100 payment will be tax-free and Prime Minister Jean Castex said it would cost the government â¬3.8bn (Â£3.2bn; $4.4bn). That would be far less than the cost of cutting fuel duty, he said. Europe is facing widespread discontent after world energy prices spiked, largely a result of huge demand from businesses recovering from the long Covid paralysis. The energy market turmoil has had a knock-on effect, disrupting supply chains and causing some shortages of fuel and other consumer goods. Gas crisis leaves Europe searching for solutions Is Russia squeezing Europe's gas supply? President Emmanuel Macron is six months away from a presidential election and the spike in energy prices threatens to trigger a new wave of mass protests. The ""gilets jaunes"" (yellow vest) protests in 2018 escalated from protests over fuel duty to a much wider anti-government movement. The anger of France's yellow vests Mr Castex said a cap on household gas prices would remain in place until the end of 2022, as world energy prices were expected to fall only gradually. Some 13 million pensioners and two-thirds of students will be among those who receive the â¬100. It will also go to about half of all workers, as â¬2,000 is the average net monthly income. Motorists have been hit by soaring fuel prices: diesel has risen to a record â¬1.56 per litre on average in France, and unleaded petrol to â¬1.62 per litre, the daily Le Monde reports.

"Many people won't get care this winter - watchdogEngland's Care Quality Commission issues a warning, saying staff are ""exhausted and depleted"".HealthHow Belarus is helping âtouristsâ break into the EU","The report pays tribute to care workers' professionalism and resilience There will be ""a tsunami"" of people without the care they need this winter unless staff shortages are tackled, England's care watchdog is warning. Social care staff are ""exhausted and depleted,"" says Care Quality Commission (CQC) chief executive, Ian Trenholm. In a report, the CQC urges immediate work to address the problem of rising numbers of unfilled care sector jobs. On Thursday, the government announced an extra Â£162.5m to boost the adult social care workforce. This is in addition to Â£5.4bn earmarked for social care over the next three years from the government's health and social care levy, which already includes Â£500m to be spent on the workforce. The CQC welcomes the money but has a warning: ""It must be used to enable new ways of working that recognise the interdependency of all health and care settings, not just to prop up existing approaches and to plug demand in acute care."" Care staff shortage harming services, say managers Care staff shortages pile pressure on NHS Social care changes at-a-glance In its latest State of Health and Social Care in England report, the CQC confirms fears that social care providers are facing a staffing crisis, losing staff to better paid jobs in retail and hospitality, and unable to recruit replacements. Across England, numbers of unfilled jobs are rising month on month, the researchers found, from 6% in April to more than 10% in September. London is worst affected with 11% of jobs vacant, followed by the East Midlands at 9.4% and the South West at 9.2%. This means care providers are having to limit their services, the researchers found. This video can not be played Care minister Gillian Keegan: ""We want to get more hours in the system"" In Devon, Rebecca Marks, director of Ark Care Homes, says more than one in five of their beds are empty, because they cannot afford to staff them. She says current staff are exhausted after the pandemic, and despite the company offering funding for training and qualifications, and paying joining bonuses, ""they are saying: 'You know, I'm going to go and work in a supermarket'"". ""We need help and we need it fast... whether it's funding to be able to pay our staff higher wages to represent the responsibility and the amazing job that they do, or something different. ""It's a very difficult place for care providers and care staff, and ultimately our residents."" Oona Goldsworthy, who oversees five care homes in the south-west of England, told BBC Breakfast she was ""literally throwing everything"" at the problem to try and fill vacancies - including increasing wages. ""We have to recognise paying carers the minimum wage is just not acceptable any more,"" she said. By Alison Holt, social affairs editor In the measured tones of a regulator, this report makes it clear that a staffing crisis in the long overlooked care system has much broader consequences. A ""tsunami of unmet need"" is more than a striking phrase. It represents a lack of support that can leave someone who is disabled or in the later years of their life struggling - alone or with family, facing grinding daily difficulties and too often deterioration that ends in crisis. It is distressing for those at the heart of it and pressure on an overstretched NHS that with the right support might have been avoided. The extra money the government has announced will help, but councils and care organisations have been quick to say it won't be enough. And the suggestion it could lead to tens of thousands of new care staff is likely to be greeted with a wry smile coming just 18 months after the last government recruitment campaign failed to do that. Unpaid carers who look after relatives at home are among those hit hard by the staffing squeeze. Dorothy Cook cares for her husband Melvin, at home in Bristol. Melvin is in the advanced stages of a degenerative brain disease which has left him unable to wash, dress, shower or feed himself without her help. Dorothy Cook cares full-time for her husband Melvin Following a fall in February, he was in hospital for six weeks, and then spent four months in a rehabilitation unit. Melvin is meant to have a care package at home but the provider ended it after five weeks, as his condition was too complex for them to manage. That was 12 weeks ago, and Dorothy is struggling. ""It all falls on my shoulders, and I'm on my knees with exhaustion,"" she told the BBC. ""We both feel completely and utterly alone. We feel that nobody cares."" Carers UK, which represents unpaid people like Dorothy, saysa survey of 8,000 of its members,externalsuggests more than half (55%) have lost some or all of the support they need, since the pandemic. The government says it will take steps to ensure that unpaid carers have the support, advice and respite they need, with more detail to be published later this year. Care companies say the main factors making it hard to find and keep staff are: burnout from the pandemic compulsory vaccinations in care homes higher pay available in other sectors as the economy picks up post-Brexit immigration rule changes In its report, the CQC pays tribute ""to the professionalism and resilience of everyone that works in social care"", but according to chief executive Ian Trenholm: ""Those people cannot be expected to work any harder. ""If we're to get safely through this winter, there needs to be urgent action."" He says local leaders of health and social care services will need ""to make maximum use of everything they have at their disposal to get safely through the winter... If these things don't happen there is the genuine risk of a tsunami of unmet need, with many people not getting the care that they so desperately need this winter."" He believes the key is more collaboration between services and urges a rapid overhaul: ""We can't be in this position in a year's time. We need to be thinking about what systems will look like in the future. ""We are really clear, there are no silver bullets, there are no simple answers to what is a very, very complex problem."" A Department of Health and Social Care official said: ""We appreciate the dedication and tireless work of health and social care staff throughout the pandemic. ""We have provided record levels of investment to support them and will provide Â£36bn over the next three years for health and social care across the UK. ""We are working on health and social care reform to ensure we can provide world-leading services and are committed to learning lessons from the pandemic, with a full public inquiry in the spring."" Shadow minister for social care, Liz Kendall, called the report ""devastating"", saying the government's recentsocial care announcementwould not help. ""Labour is calling for a ten-year plan of investment and reform,"" to include a new deal to transform pay, training and conditions for care staff, and a shift in focus towards prevention and early intervention, said Ms Kendall.

Fireman Sam 'wouldn't exist' without cash support,"This video can not be played SuperTed started with a teddy, a tea towel and a bedtime story SuperTed and Fireman Sam would never have been made without cash help from the government, the driving force behind the popular cartoons has said. It comes as UK ministers consider if they will continue subsidising children's TV shows for Channel 5, E4 and the Welsh language channel S4C. SuperTed and Fireman Sam started on S4C before being broadcast in English. ""They would not have been made without subsidies,"" said Fireman Sam producer and SuperTed creator Mike Young. Leading presenters, including former Play School anchor Baroness Floella Benjamin, now a House of Lords peer, and former Blue Peter presenter Konnie Huq have expressed their concern for the future of children's programming if the UK government cut theirYoung Audiences Content Fund,external. SuperTed cartoon set to be brought back to life The story behind Fireman Sam Who is the man that creates Peppa Pig voices? It was set up in 2018 and helps cover the cost of making children's shows for public service broadcasters and it has allocated more than Â£44m over a three-year trial to support the production of shows on public serving broadcasting channels. But there are fears future funding could affected by the UK government'songoing spending reviewalthough the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said no decision had been made. This video can not be played How the singer of the famous Fireman Sam theme tune got just Â£250! Mike Young, now a Hollywood-based Emmy and Bafta award-winning animator, said he was ""flabbergasted"" that cash for children's content could be cut because, although animation ""is there to be fun, it is at the same time incredibly educational"". ""It would be a very short-sighted decision and it's a minor investment when compared to some of the money that governments tend to waste in other areas."" Mr Young, who still makes animations and runs a Los Angeles-based production company, said children's shows were attractive to TV channels and streaming services because ""kids watch content more than adults"". ""A child will watch the same programme over and over again as part of their learning process,"" he said. ""Whereas adults will watch, say The Crown once and never watch it again."" ""So children's TV shows have a new generation every three years or so, especially in the younger demographics. ""Plus they're long lasting and earn money from merchandising. I can go down the road now in LA and buy a Fireman Sam toy. ""If they [UK government] take these grants and subsidies away, it'll put the UK at a tremendous disadvantage to the rest of the world. It'll really set back an industry if this happens."" This video can not be played Mr Potato, Mr Fox, Mr Rabbit - and even Naughty Norman: John Sparkes gets into character My Young started his career creating SuperTed, which was broadcast as S4C's first programme when the channel launched in November 1982. ""In the case of S4C, it's not just making shows for children, it's actually retaining a language and a culture - it goes beyond children's TV programmes,"" he added. Cult cartoon ready to steam in for comeback Peppa Pig voice Harley Bird to step down Mr Young also played an integral role in making Fireman Sam - Sam Tan in Welsh - a hit on S4C before both animations were translated into English. Despite both being TV staples for millions of children in the 1980s, well before the creation of the Young Audiences Content Fund, he said both were partly funded by government subsidies of the day. The body representing independent TV companies in Wales said, without the government fund, it was ""very doubtful"" that dramas for young people and new animation series would have been commissioned. ""It is really short-sighted now when we are seeing some really good evidence from dozens of programmes who have been commissioned though this fund and to now look at stopping it is doesn't make sense to me,"" said Gareth Williams, chairman of Teledwyr Annibynnol Cymru. This video can not be played The making of Fireman Sam's much-loved characters One of the beneficiaries of the government fund is producer Nia Ceidiog, Fireman Sam's original scriptwriter, who is making a children's drama with a focus on mental health. ""It would have been impossible to produce this in the Welsh language had it not been for an award from the YAC fund,"" she said. ""Drama is expensive and S4C would not have been able to produce drama for children of that standard so having this award - 50% of the budget - is crucial"". S4C said the fund has helped the Welsh language channel ""invest in productions that otherwise would not have seen the light of day,""including cult Welsh hit Sali Mali. ""Whilst S4C has done well from the YAC fund, and whilst S4C would not like to see the end of this important source of money for original content from Wales, its end would not have a negative impact on S4C's wider children's offering,"" it said. ""Even without the contribution of the YAC fund, S4C is the second biggest commissioner of children's TV programmes.""

Second-hand car prices surge amid new car shortage,"Second-hand car prices are rising at ""unprecedented rates"", the AA has said, as more people consider buying used cars amid a low supply of new vehicles. Research by the motoring group suggests the price of the UK's most popular cars have increased up to 57% since 2019. Three to five-year-old Ford Fiestas, the most popular on its AA Cars website, were now valued at Â£9,770 compared to Â£7,448 two years ago. Industry figures said ""nearly new"" used cars were in particular high demand. Price rises have been driven by a number of factors. A global shortage of computer chips used in car production, as well as other materials such as copper, aluminium and cobalt, has led to fewer new vehicles rolling off production lines. That has meant more buyers turning to the used-car market. AA Cars, which compared the prices of three, four and five year-old cars between 2019 and 2021, said demand for some models was so strong that they are increasing in value with age. Why the banger on your drive is suddenly worth a lot more Second-hand car sales soar amid shortage of new models Chip shortage could last into 2023, says car boss Analysis from the motoring group's website found the price of a three-year-old Mini Hatch in 2021 was 57% higher (Â£15,367) than a model of the same age in 2019 (Â£9,811). Meanwhile, research said the price of a five-year-old Mini Hatch had jumped 15% compared to what a three-year-old model was worth in 2019, meaning the car gained in value despite getting two years older. Audi A3s saw the biggest jump in prices since 2019 (46.09%), followed by Ford Focuses (43.11%), which were the second most popular car on the AA's website. The motoring group said the first easing of coronavirus lockdown restrictions in summer 2020 had ""unleashed demand"" that had been ""pent up"" during the early stages of the pandemic. It said a shortage of new cars for sale led many drivers to buy used rather than new, with ""demand pressures pushing up second-hand prices at unprecedented rates"". James Fairclough, chief executive of AA Cars, said some popular cars were growing in value ""even as they sit on the driveway"". ""With the exception of houses and some classic cars, things rarely go up in value as they age,"" he said. Mr Fairclough said despite the price growth in used cars, it was ""still possible to get a good deal"" if people shopped around. Besides new car supply issues, used-car dealerships have also experienced a shortage of stock as trade-ins have been reduced, according industry figures. The rise of online dealers with large advertising budgets such as Cinch, Cazoo and We Buy Any Car has also changed the market. The used-car price surge along with rising energy, grocery and transport costs has contributed to the UK's higher inflation rate. It has led to the Bank of England warning it ""will have to act"", suggesting interest rates may rise soon. Peter Smyth, director of family business Swansway Car Dealers, told the BBC ""nearly-new cars"" were now a ""desirable product"" because of the slow supply of new ones. He said ""the more expensive cars"" on his forecourts such as Audi Q7s and Land Rovers, were ""selling the fastest"". ""We are selling less cars for more money,"" he said. ""You cannot replace the stock you have got."" ""We look at our prices of our cars on a daily basis and we move them with the market place."" Mr Smyth said he expected prices to remain high for the next six to 12 months. He added he had been told by manufacturers that next year was going to be ""tight"" due to the shortage of materials such as computer chips. ""What you will find is manufacturers will have more supply of luxury cars next year than lower end stuff,"" he said. ""They are going to put the chips in the high-value cars where they make the most margin."" In August, the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT) said second-hand car sales in the UK had more than doubled. Petrol cars made up most of the sales, with Ford Fiestas, Vauxhall Corsas, Ford Focuses and Volkswagen Golfs being the most popular models. Mike Hawes, SMMT chief executive, said that while a buoyant used-car market was ""important, as strong residual values support new car transactions"", it was ""critical we have a healthy new car market to help accelerate fleet renewal by allowing motorists to replace older, less efficient vehicles with the latest, cleanest models"".

PM warned over aid cuts ahead of climate summit,"Senior government climate change advisers have warned Boris Johnson against more foreign aid cuts ahead of the COP26 summit, the BBC has learned. In a letter to the PM, they expressed ""deep concern"" at the cuts planned by the Chancellor Rishi Sunak next week. The experts said the cuts would show the UK was ""neither committed to nor serious about"" helping countries vulnerable to climate change. The Treasury said the UK was a ""world leader"" in international development. Who stands to lose out from UK aid cuts? Leak reveals lobbying to change key climate report Why does a climate summit need 25,000 people? The panel - known officially as the Friends of COP - was appointed by Alok Sharma, the Cop president, to advise the government ahead of next month's summit in Glasgow - and includes some of the most experienced climate experts in the world. Their letter - which has been seen by the BBC - said: ""As 'Friends of COP' we are writing to you to express our deep concern at the prospect of further UK aid cuts in the final few days before COP26."" It went on: ""The ability of the UK to act as a genuine, trusted partner for developing countries is of crucial importance to COP26's success. Further implied cuts to overseas aid at the Comprehensive Spending Review (CSR) would send a signal that the UK is neither committed to, nor serious about, enabling a green global recovery from the pandemic, nor improving the resilience of the most vulnerable to climate change."" The cuts would come as the result of complicated accounting changes planned by the Treasury for next week's Spending Review. Officials want to broaden the definition of what counts as overseas aid. Specifically, they want to include complex currency handouts from the International Monetary Fund known as Special Drawing Rights (SDRs), and Covid vaccine donations for poorer countries. If these counted towards the government's current overseas aid target of 0.5% of national income, it could mean more than Â£1bn less is spent on humanitarian and development support. The letter says the UK would ""maintain its credibility and maximise the chances of a successful summit"" if it did not classify SDRs and Covid vaccines as foreign aid. The fear among climate campaigners is that developing countries will lose trust in the financial promises made by the UK - and other richer nations - to help them adapt their economies to climate change. Many poorer countries have already voiced their concerns about the UK's previously announced decision to cut aid by more than Â£4bn this year. In a recent report, the Overseas Development Institute warned a ""sleight of hand"" with foreign aid risked sabotaging negotiations in Glasgow. ""If the Treasury slashes budgetary commitments to climate finance days before COP26 starts, developing countries - which have typically contributed fewer per capita emissions - will rightly question why they should bear the costs of climate action and whether they can trust the pledges of developed countries."" The Friends of COP who have signed the letter include: Lord Stern, chairman of the Grantham Research Institute of Climate Change Laurence Tubiana, CEO of the European Climate Foundation and a former architect of the Paris climate agreement Manuel Pulgar-Vidal, former president of COP20 Lord Turner, chairman of the Energy Transitions Commission Christiana Figueres, former executive secretary of the UN framework convention on climate change Corinne Le QuÃ©rÃ©, professor of climate change science at the University of East Anglia James Cameron, former chairman of the ODI Mary Robinson, chair of the Elders A Treasury spokesman said the UK ""is and will remain a world leader in international development"". ""This year we provided over Â£10bn towards poverty reduction, climate change and global health security - a greater proportion of our national income than the majority of the G7,"" he said, adding ""we will return to the 0.7% target when the fiscal situation allows"".

"'While I was quiet, I was protecting a paedophile'A victim waives her anonymity to speak out about the sexual abuse inflicted by her stepfather.Northern Ireland","Haileigh Ashton Lamont said she wanted to tell her own story, in her own words A Belfast woman who was sexually abused by her stepfather as a child has waived her anonymity to speak out about what happened to her. Haileigh Ashton Lamont said she wanted to tell her own story, in her own words, but also to share her experience of the prosecution process. She said she did so in the hope it might help prepare other victims and survivors considering coming forward. Her abuser, Tommy Harris, 48, pleaded guilty to 42 counts of sexual assault. The charges against Harris, who has an address at Wynchurch Road in Belfast, included rape, attempted rape, indecent assault and gross indecency with a child. The abuse took place over a decade, from 1999 to 2009. It started when Haileigh was seven, and didn't end until she was 18. Last year, after seeing her mental and physical health suffer under the strain, Haileigh reported what had happened to police. Now 30, she said: ""On the 7th of July I walked into a police station in Belfast. I was hysterical, I was panicking, I couldn't breathe. This video can not be played ""If you can imagine the feeling of dread that you've had or the worst day of your life, that was my every day"" ""And that's when I said for the first time in my life: 'My stepfather sexually abused me when I was a child.' ""I thought once I said that out loud in a police station that would be enough. ""But since then, I've had to fight to get justice - and it has been a fight."" Haileigh said her earliest and most thorough memory of the sexual abuse was when she was seven or eight. She said she lived in fear all the time. ""If you can imagine the feeling of dread that you've had or the worst day of your life, that was my every day,"" she said. ""Whenever I was a young child, I didn't know why my skin was crawling, why I wanted to die, because it was a person in a position of trust, and I was too young to understand. ""And then the older I got, I was still a child, but I understood that it was sexual abuse that I was suffering, and so frequently, I had to live with all that, and pretend that I was OK - because I was so fearful of what he would do if I exposed him or somebody found out. ""While I was staying quiet I was protecting a paedophile, that's how I felt."" A judge at Laganside Court told Haileigh she should ""hold her head high"" Haileigh said she still feels an overwhelming urge to apologise to anybody she brought into her life because they were exposed to what had happened. ""But I was just so into survival mode that I didn't see it like that at the time,"" she said. ""I've managed to break it down to me versus him, and I chose myself."" Haileigh wanted to waive the anonymity she is legally entitled to as a victim of sexual abuse in order to ""take control"" of her story ""You can't do what he done to me and get away with it. There has to be consequences,"" she said. ""If I can share my experience and it resonates with one person and they think that if they come forward they might have a better understanding of what to expect, it's worth it then for me."" Haileigh said she wants justice - but what is justice to her now? ""If I'd have answered that back when I walked into the police station - I was so set on there needing to be a conviction,"" she said. ""I fantasised my whole life about justice. ""Justice to me now is the sound of my voice - being able to talk about this and to not be afraid any more after living my whole life in fear."" Haileigh said she is now ""excited"" about her future - she's at university, studying to become a counsellor. ""I feel like I'm at the starting line, like I could do anything,"" she said. ""I am a prime example of not knowing what happens behind closed doors, because I know no-one would have suspected what I've been through or what I was keeping to myself."" Harris will be sentenced next month. On Thursday at Laganside court in Belfast, a judge told Haileigh she should ""hold her head high"", after reading her victim impact statement. He said: ""You have done absolutely everything that could have been expected of you in bringing this case, and bringing it to a conclusion."" Haileigh has this message to her abuser. ""I will not be remembered as the wee girl who was sexually abused,"" she said. ""I will be remembered as the young woman who boldly and bravely stood up for herself and exposed a paedophile. ""That is not a representation of defeat, that is victory."" If you have been affected by the issues raised in this story, help and support can be found atBBC Action Line.

"Scottish schools spending 'highest per pupil in UK'Teacher pay rises and extra pandemic funding have reversed spending cuts during the past decade, analysis has found.Scotland","Extra funding to deal with the coronavirus pandemic boosted the average spend in Scotland Scotland has the highest spending on schools per pupil of any UK nation, analysis has found. Teacher pay rises and extra Covid funding reversed spending cuts during the past decade, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said. Its research found spending per pupil in 2021-22 was estimated to be Â£7,600 per pupil - more than Â£800 higher than in England, Wales and Northern Ireland. Spending between 2009-10 and 2014-15 fell by 7% in real terms. It then increased by the same percentage over the following five years. The biggest increase in the Scottish government's funding for schools was a 6% real terms rise in 2019-20, amounting to an additional Â£400 per pupil. This was driven by a 7% increase of teacher pay scales and a further backdated 3% rise. In England, total spending grew by 12% but coincided with a 13% rise in pupil numbers. Spending per pupil was lowest in Northern Ireland. The Scottish figures include extra Covid spending, not included for other nations, but the IFS said ""even after making plausible adjustments"", core spending per pupil was more than Â£800 higher in Scotland. Figures relate to total day-to-day school spending on children aged three to 19 by schools, local authorities and funding agencies. Luke Sibieta, author of the research at the IFS, said it was important to remember ""higher spending need not automatically translate into better educational outcomes"". He added: ""Indeed, international comparisons of test scores suggest numeracy and science scores were declining in high-spending Scotland relative to the OECD average up to 2018. ""It remains to be seen whether extra spending in Scotland since 2018 will arrest this trend."" Josh Hillman, director of education at the Nuffield Foundation that funded the study, said the IFS analysis showed the ""increasing divergence in education policy"" between the UK nations extended to school spending per pupil. He added: ""A major cause for concern is that funding for education recovery programmes in response to the pandemic is much lower across all four nations than those being implemented in comparable countries."" SNP MSP, and former teacher, Kaukab Stewart said the Scottish government's investment was ""paying off"". ""School buildings are in the best condition since records began, teacher numbers are higher than they've been since 2008, this year the number of Higher passes was at its highest since devolution, the number of Scottish students accepted to university is at a record high, and much more,"" she said. ""As we move out of the pandemic and into recovery, it is vital that our schools are put on a footing to continue to get the best for Scotland's young people."" Closing the ""poverty-related attainment gap"" was an SNP priority and a further Â£1bn would be invested in the Scottish Attainment Challenge during this parliament, she added.

LiveLiveBooster jabs campaign launches to increase take-up8 minutes ago,"An estimated one in 60 people in the UK had coronavirus in the week ending 16 October, the Office for National Statistics says That figure is one in 45 for Wales, one in 55 for England, one in 90 in Scotland and one in 130 in NI Scientists advising the government say it should prepare to trigger its stricter Plan B measures now, amid rising cases A further 49,298 Covid cases have been recorded in the UK, meaning there have been 10 consecutive days of more than 40,000 cases The PM says ""now is the time"" for people to book their booster jabs; some 5.3 million have already been given across the UK A new mutated form of Covid that some are calling ""Delta Plus"" may spread more easily than regular Delta, UK experts now say The 43,000 incorrect Covid test results given by a lab in England date back further than previously thought, the UK Health Security Agency says Edited by Hamish Mackay Thanks for joining our live coverage of the coronavirus pandemic today, we'll be back on Monday. Here are the day's main Covid headlines:  Today's live page was written by Joseph Lee, Malu Cursino and Doug Faulkner. It was edited by Hamish Mackay. Daily reported Covid cases in Belgium have reached their highest level in almost a year, after a 60% rise over the previous week. On Friday, the country recorded almost 6,500 cases - as many as in November last year, just before the government ordered a second lockdown. However, the infection rate is still below the country's peak in mid-October of last year, when cases were running at 15,000 a day, contributing to Belgium having one of the world's highest per-capita death rates from Covid. But with 87% of the eligible population vaccinated, Belgium's coronavirus commissioner says vaccines are preventing 70% of infections and 90% of hospital admissions. Elsewhere in Europe, Germany has recorded a 70% week-on-week rise in infections, with 19,572 reported on Friday. And as we mentioned earlier, Poland has seen its case numbers rise by 106% in a week. This video can not be played 'Russia's Covid mortality rate similar to WWII' - epidemiologist Dr Vasily Vlassov, an epidemiologist at HSE University, says there is ""definitely"" a Covid crisis in Russia and says that the level of mortality may be similar to that seen during World War Two. He adds that Russia's true daily death toll may be double the ""optimistic"" official figures. Vladimir Putin has told people to stay away from their workplace for a week at the start of November in a bid to slow the spread of the virus. Covid infections in the UK are up 17.9% over the past week,
with 52,009 cases reported yesterday and a further 49,298 today. The rise in infections has led to an increase in
the reproduction value - orR number- from
between 0.9 and 1.1, to 1.0 and 1.2. in England. That means for
every 10 people who have Covid, a further 10 to 12 people will become
infected. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter. We ask for your permission before anything is loaded, as they may be using cookies and other technologies.

Lucy Wightman, director of public health for Northamptonshire, says the countyhas ""got to make sure we're using all of the tools in the box"". ""Vaccination is great but it's not a silver bullet,"" she says. A further 763 cases of Covid-19 have been recorded in the county in the latest 24-hour period. ""We need people to be getting all of their doses of the vaccination including the booster when they're eligible,"" she says. ""But that doesn't negate the need for us to still be testing on a regular basis, to still be using face coverings in crowded spaces and for us to be social distancing where we can, think about who we're mixing with on a regular basis and just basic things like handwashing."" This video can not be played Covid-19: BMA NI chairman Tom Black warns against easing restrictions further Dr Tom Black, chairman of the British Medical Association (BMA) in Northern Ireland, says further easing of restrictions in NI is ""madness"" and ""stupid"". On Thursday,the executive agreed people will not need to wear masks while dancing in nightclubswhen they reopen next Sunday. Health minister Robin Swann has warned thatNorthern Ireland is ""facing into the most difficult winter ever experienced"". Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst The pandemic has triggered Chinese tourism companies into exploring new ways of making money, with online sightseeing trips becoming increasingly popular. The national China Daily newspaper notes that in the last year, popular travel agencies like Qunar have teamed up with theme parks and drone companies to offer livestreaming shows to consumers. In the past 18 months, the paper says ânearly 10 million of its users [have] joined a livestreaming show to enjoy beautiful views via dronesâ of sites such as the Forbidden City or Mount Emei, a mountain sacred in Buddhism. While some companies say this kind of travel can simply be a supplement to in-person travelling, there is a recognition in Chinaâs media that strict Covid-19 controls have left people starved of travel. Tourist sites and companies have often been the first to feel the brunt of Covid-19 controls. When cases of the virus are directed in cities, flights are often immediately suspended, and large-scale venues either significantly reduce their capacity, or close. There have been a further 180 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test across the UK. It takes the total number who have died by that measure to 139,146. The most recent figures also show there are 8,238 patients with Covid in hospitals across the country. A further 48,732 people received a first dose of vaccine on Thursday, while 26,828 received a second dose. A further 49,298 coronavirus cases have been reported across the UK. It marks the 10th consecutive day new cases have been above 40,000. Health Secretary Sajid Javid previously warned daily cases could reach 100,000 a day in the coming months. Two schools in Herefordshire have closed early for half-term
due to a spike in Covid cases. Both Lady Hawkins High School in Kington and Eardisley
Primary School are shut today, allowing for a 10-day âfire breakâ. The schools
will reopen on Monday 1 November. In addition to this, the head teacher at Lady Hawkins, Paul
Jennings, says the school has increased cleaning and reintroduced face masks in
classes. According to the ONS, one in 13 children in school years 7 to 11 tested
positive for Covid last week. Jennings adds: âWe have taken the decision to close for half-term on Thursday 21 October, which is only a day early, but allows everyone 10
full days away from school, to act as a 'fire break' in transmission."" You can read more on this story here. Weâve been asking for your views on whether, amid rising
cases, the government should turn to its âPlan Bâ for winter. Plan B would
include the reintroduction of some social distancing measures and mandatory
mask-wearing in certain circumstances. Mark from Nottingham - who is clinically extremely vulnerable - shared with us why he believes the government
should turn to Plan B for winter. He recently had a hospital appointment and had to commute by bus to
attend the appointment. He says the journey there and back âinvolved four different
busesâ and three of the buses âwere almost fullâ. He says he was âshocked to
see that only two or three passengers were wearing masks or face coveringsâ. Due to his circumstances, Mark says he feels like he is
playing âRussian rouletteâ every time he takes the bus. Mark urges the government to reintroduce mandatory
mask-wearing on public transport, adding the ""slightest infringement"" of a face covering is ""far outweighed by the benefit it
would achieveâ. You can read more about what ""Plan B"" is here. Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online A new mutated form of coronavirus that some are calling ""Delta Plus"" may spread more easily than regular Delta, UK experts now say. The UK Health Security Agency has moved it up into the ""variant under investigation"" category, to reflect this possible risk. There is no evidence yet that it causes worse illness. And scientists are confident that existing vaccines should still work well to protect people. Read the full story here. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst There have been 28 symptomatic cases of Covid-19 in the last 24 hours in China. Although by international standards this figure might seem relatively small, these cases span seven provincial-level regions, igniting concerns that China is on the cusp of a large-scale winter outbreak. Four regions have now introduced lockdowns: Inner Mongolia, Gansu, Guizhou and the capital, Beijing. China has a zero-Covid strategy, and immediately locks down communities when new cases are confirmed, to prevent transmission. Large-scale testing drives are also ordered, and millions of people are tested for Covid-19 often within two or three days. More than 70% of Chinaâs population has been fully vaccinated, and there are projections that China will have fully vaccinated more than 80% of the population by the end of the year. Nevertheless, there is still a lot of caution. Booster jabs are currently being rolled out in many major cities, and the Wuhan marathon, which was set to take place this Sunday, has now been postponed - even though there are currently no cases in the city. Boris Johnson says there is ""nothing to indicate"" that a full lockdown with a ""stay at home"" order is on the cards this winter. He says: ""I've got to tell you at the moment that we see absolutely nothing to indicate that that's on the cards at all."" The prime minister's visit to the vaccine centre lasted about 40 minutes. He spoke with staff and members of the public, greeting people with elbow bumps. Johnson, who was wearing a mask, also spoke to two pharmacists who were preparing vaccine doses. We've got more from the prime minister, who is at a vccination centre in west London. Asked if he is ignoring advice from government scientists about working from home, Boris Johnson says ministers keep measures under constant review and ""we do whatever we have to do to protect the public"". ""What we want people to do is to come forward and get their jabs,"" he says. ""We also want young people, we want kids at school, to be getting their jabs. ""There'll be booking systems opening from tomorrow in addition to the vaccination programme in schools."" He adds it is ""important"" people get a booster jab because ""the double vaccination provides a lot of protection against serious illness and death but it doesn't protect you against catching the disease, and it doesn't protect you against passing it on"". ""So now is the time to get your booster,"" he says. Prime Minister Boris Johnson says that the government's autumn and winter plan ""always predicted that cases would rise around about now"". Speaking during a visit to a Covid vaccination centre in west London, he says we are seeing ""high levels of infection"" but they are not outside the parameters of what was predicted. ""But it's very important that people do follow the guidance on general behaviour,"" he says. ""Wear a mask, wash hands, ventilation, all that kind of thing, but also get your booster jab, and that's the key message that we want to get across."" The PM says the booster programme has been planned for this time of year because ""there is some evidence, obviously, that the vaccines start to wane"" - but adds that a new study suggests a booster offers ""very, very good protection"". An estimated 5.3 million booster doses of Covid-19 vaccine have been delivered in the UK, new figures show. It is the first time data on boosters has been reported by all four nations. There have been: It means around one in nine people in the UK who have received a first and second dose of vaccine are likely to have also received a booster. The figures have been published by NHS England, Public Health Scotland, Public Health Wales and the Northern Ireland Department of Health. The figure for England includes a small number of third primary doses of vaccine, NHS England says. The government hasfaced calls this week to introduce its Covid winter Plan Bamid rising case numbers. So far the government has resisted moving from Plan A - which involves encouraging the take up of booster shots and lateral flow tests. The Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies says the government needs to prepare to put Plan B measures - such as stricter face mask rules and greater social distancing - in place. As you can see from the graph below, the percentage of people practising basic Covid prevention measures has fallen. And the proportion of people working exclusively from home has also fallen after the country eased restrictions. Sage says that advising people to work from home could have the greatest impact on stopping the virus spreading. The NHS in Lanarkshire hasmoved to its highest risk levelas all three of its hospitals have reached maximum capacity. The military is already providing additional support at University hospitals Hairmyres, Monklands and Wishaw. But the health board describes occupancy levels as ""critical"" and says the ""sustained pressure"" shows no signs of easing. It also confirms some elective cancer procedures have been cancelled. Deputy chief executive Laura Ace says the area is facing  ""relentless pressures, bed shortages and staff shortages due to sickness, stress and self-isolation"". Earlier this week,NHS Grampianbecame the latest Scottish health board to ask for military help amid the pandemic, after NHS Lanarkshire and NHS Borders. Richard GalpinBBC World Affairs reporter Near the darkened entrance of Hospital Number One in the city of Vologda in Russia's north-west, an ambulance crew delivers yet another Covid patient, an elderly man struggling to breathe and barely alive. Inside the hospital, the wards are teeming with the sick and the dying. Doctors here say out of 750 patients currently in the hospital with Covid, 700 of them had not been vaccinated. Across the country, more than 1,000 people are dying each day, with a total of more than 220,000 deaths so far. These are record numbers for Russia, the worst-hit in Europe. One of the key explanations for this record number of cases and deaths is a lack of trust in the Sputnik V and other Russian-made coronavirus vaccines among many in the population. This, in part, is the result of many years of scepticism of what the authorities say or do. In Vologda just 26% of the population has been vaccinated, one of the lowest levels in the country.

SuperTed 'wouldn't exist' without cash support,"This video can not be played SuperTed started with a teddy, a tea towel and a bedtime story SuperTed and Fireman Sam would never have been made without cash help from the government, the driving force behind the popular cartoons has said. It comes as UK ministers consider if they will continue subsidising children's TV shows for Channel 5, E4 and the Welsh language channel S4C. SuperTed and Fireman Sam started on S4C before being broadcast in English. ""They would not have been made without subsidies,"" said Fireman Sam producer and SuperTed creator Mike Young. Leading presenters, including former Play School anchor Baroness Floella Benjamin, now a House of Lords peer, and former Blue Peter presenter Konnie Huq have expressed their concern for the future of children's programming if the UK government cut theirYoung Audiences Content Fund,external. SuperTed cartoon set to be brought back to life The story behind Fireman Sam Who is the man that creates Peppa Pig voices? It was set up in 2018 and helps cover the cost of making children's shows for public service broadcasters and it has allocated more than Â£44m over a three-year trial to support the production of shows on public serving broadcasting channels. But there are fears future funding could affected by the UK government'songoing spending reviewalthough the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said no decision had been made. This video can not be played How the singer of the famous Fireman Sam theme tune got just Â£250! Mike Young, now a Hollywood-based Emmy and Bafta award-winning animator, said he was ""flabbergasted"" that cash for children's content could be cut because, although animation ""is there to be fun, it is at the same time incredibly educational"". ""It would be a very short-sighted decision and it's a minor investment when compared to some of the money that governments tend to waste in other areas."" Mr Young, who still makes animations and runs a Los Angeles-based production company, said children's shows were attractive to TV channels and streaming services because ""kids watch content more than adults"". ""A child will watch the same programme over and over again as part of their learning process,"" he said. ""Whereas adults will watch, say The Crown once and never watch it again."" ""So children's TV shows have a new generation every three years or so, especially in the younger demographics. ""Plus they're long lasting and earn money from merchandising. I can go down the road now in LA and buy a Fireman Sam toy. ""If they [UK government] take these grants and subsidies away, it'll put the UK at a tremendous disadvantage to the rest of the world. It'll really set back an industry if this happens."" This video can not be played Mr Potato, Mr Fox, Mr Rabbit - and even Naughty Norman: John Sparkes gets into character My Young started his career creating SuperTed, which was broadcast as S4C's first programme when the channel launched in November 1982. ""In the case of S4C, it's not just making shows for children, it's actually retaining a language and a culture - it goes beyond children's TV programmes,"" he added. Cult cartoon ready to steam in for comeback Peppa Pig voice Harley Bird to step down Mr Young also played an integral role in making Fireman Sam - Sam Tan in Welsh - a hit on S4C before both animations were translated into English. Despite both being TV staples for millions of children in the 1980s, well before the creation of the Young Audiences Content Fund, he said both were partly funded by government subsidies of the day. The body representing independent TV companies in Wales said, without the government fund, it was ""very doubtful"" that dramas for young people and new animation series would have been commissioned. ""It is really short-sighted now when we are seeing some really good evidence from dozens of programmes who have been commissioned though this fund and to now look at stopping it is doesn't make sense to me,"" said Gareth Williams, chairman of Teledwyr Annibynnol Cymru. This video can not be played The making of Fireman Sam's much-loved characters One of the beneficiaries of the government fund is producer Nia Ceidiog, Fireman Sam's original scriptwriter, who is making a children's drama with a focus on mental health. ""It would have been impossible to produce this in the Welsh language had it not been for an award from the YAC fund,"" she said. ""Drama is expensive and S4C would not have been able to produce drama for children of that standard so having this award - 50% of the budget - is crucial"". S4C said the fund has helped the Welsh language channel ""invest in productions that otherwise would not have seen the light of day,""including cult Welsh hit Sali Mali. ""Whilst S4C has done well from the YAC fund, and whilst S4C would not like to see the end of this important source of money for original content from Wales, its end would not have a negative impact on S4C's wider children's offering,"" it said. ""Even without the contribution of the YAC fund, S4C is the second biggest commissioner of children's TV programmes.""

Catholic primate tells of sadness at partition,"This video can not be played ""Our past has shaped and scarred us"" The head of the Irish Catholic Church has said partition causes him ""a deep sense of loss and sadness"". Archbishop Eamon Martin was addressing a service to mark the centenary of Ireland being divided and the formation of Northern Ireland. In 1921, the island was divided into Northern Ireland and the Irish Free State. Prime Minister Boris Johnson joined 150 guests from both sides of the border at the event on Thursday. Archbishop Martin said for the past 100 years, partition had ""polarised people on this island"". ""It has institutionalised difference, and it remains a symbol of cultural, political and religious division between our communities,"" he said. He told the service in Armagh's Church of Ireland Cathedral that he also felt churches could have gone further. NI Secretary Brandon Lewis and Prime Minister Boris Johnson were among those attending the centenary church service ""I have to face the difficult truth that, perhaps, we in the churches could have done more to deepen our understanding of each other and to bring healing and peace to our divided and wounded communities,"" he said. Speaking afterwards, the prime minister said: ""It has been very moving to be here today and see the way in which people from very different perspectives have come together."" Mr Johnson said Northern Ireland was ""an incredible part of the country"" and had ""an amazing future"". The prime minister added: ""I am a passionate unionist and, of course, I believe the future is within the United Kingdom."" The Queen had been due to attend the service but wasunable to travel for medical reasons. Irish president Michael D Higginsdeclined an invitation. The Armagh church service was organised to ""mark the centenaries of the partition of Ireland and the formation of Northern Ireland"". President Higgins said the title of the service made it ""inappropriate"" for him to attend as head of state. Sinn FÃ©in, including Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill, also decided not to attend. A children's choir sang during the church service marking Northern Ireland's centenary However, Colum Eastwood, the leader of Northern Ireland's other nationalist party, the SDLP, was present. Among others at the service were Northern Ireland First Minister Paul Givan, of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP); DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson; Ulster Unionist Party leader Doug Beattie; Alliance leader Naomi Long; Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis and Northern Ireland's chief medical officer Sir Michael McBride. Two representatives from the Irish government were also present- Minister for Foreign Affairs Simon Coveney, from the Fine Gael party, and chief whip Jack Chambers, from Fianna FÃ¡il. With Assembly Speaker Alex Maskey, a Sinn FÃ©in member, not attending, deputy speaker Roy Beggs formally represented the Northern Ireland Assembly. Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney arriving at the service The event, titled ""A Service of Reflection and Hope"", was organised by the leaders of the main Protestant and Catholic Churches. It began with the ringing of the cathedral bell before the Dean of Armagh, Rev Shane Forster, sent his good wishes to the Queen. Welcoming the congregation in both English and Irish, he said: ""Our past has shaped us and scarred us, it has divided us. And, yet, it has also, on occasion, brought us together."" The leaders of Ireland's main churches delivered their personal reflections on the creation of Northern Ireland. This video can not be played Church leaders reflect on NI's centenary The Moderator of the Presbyterian Church in Ireland, Dr David Bruce, said: ""I grieve the times when fear has held us back from building relationships with those with whom we differ. ""If we are to build a better future, then we must recognise our own woundedness and our responsibility to care for the wounds of one another."" Dr Ivan Patterson, the president of the Irish Council of Churches, said ""we need to learn"" from the example of young people. ""They are a generation who want to build peace, a generation who respect and care for this planet in solidarity with the poorest and most vulnerable here and around the world."" Church of Ireland Primate Rev John McDowell said:  ""I am hopeful. Hopeful in a new generation who know that the big problems we've landed them with, especially climate change and economic inequality, can only be tackled together. ""I think there are already signs that the next generation will see the things that we obsessed about as secondary and place their priorities elsewhere. ""As we lament our failures, sorrows and pain, and recognise our wounded yet living history, may we with a united voice commit ourselves to work together for the common good, in mutual respect and with shared hope for a light-filled, prosperous and peaceful future."" The main sermon was given by Rev Dr Sahr Yambasu, the president of the Methodist Church in Ireland The main sermon was given by the president of the Methodist Church in Ireland, Rev Dr Sahr Yambasu, who told the congregation: ""We have come a long way - not just a century but centuries. ""During that time people have cared for one another and made efforts to build community."" But he added: ""We have also been blighted by sectarian divisions, terrible injustices, destructive violence, and by win-lose political attitudes. And for this, we have cause to lament."" African-born leader to give centenary sermon Queen cancels Northern Ireland trip on medical advice Church leaders hope for 'healing' centenary events Dr Yambasu said Thursday's service was an opportunity ""to give thanks and, also, lament; to imagine what could be, and to choose the way forward that can be mutually beneficial"". The service included an opening prayer in Irish led by Linda Ervine and SeÃ¡n Coll. Intercessions were offered by Prof Mary Hannon-Fletcher and Robert Barfoot, both of whom were injured in the Troubles. Children carried a lantern to the altar, a symbol of light and hope for the future. Northern Ireland was established inMay 1921 after the partition of Ireland. It followed decades of turmoil between nationalists, who wanted independence from British rule, and unionists, who wanted to remain in the United Kingdom. The border divided the 32-county island into two separate jurisdictions - six counties in the north-east became Northern Ireland, which is still part of the UK. The other 26-county territory became the Irish Free State, but is now the Republic of Ireland. Nationalists, north and south of the border, were infuriated by partition and continued to campaign for independence for the whole island. Many unionists were also bitterly disappointed, especially those who lived on the southern side and woke up to find themselves in a new state on 3 May 1921. The BBC News NI website has a dedicated section marking the 100th anniversary of the creation of Northern Ireland and partition of the island. There are special reports on the major figures of the time and the events that shaped modern Ireland available atbbc.co.uk/ni100.

How adjusting flight plans can help the climate,"Aircraft condensation trails can have a significant impact on the climate, say researchers Those wispy white lines that crisscross the skies after an aeroplane flies overhead are far less benign than their fluffy patterns might suggest. Until now governments and industry have firmly focused on cutting CO2 emissions from aircraft - with good reason, asthe aviation sector is responsible for around 2.4% of global CO2 emissions,externaland a single flight can emit as much CO2 as many people do in an entire year. But some scientists are now warning that the impact of radiation caused by aircraft condensation trails (contrails) could even be more significant. Contrails, which heighten the effect of global warming,may account for more than half (57%) of the entire climate impact of aviation,external. Contrails are water vapour that condenses as ice onto soot particles emitted from aircraft engines. They don't always occur as it requires certain atmospheric conditions: the air must be very cold, humid and ""supersaturated"" for ice to form. They trap and absorb outgoing heat which otherwise escapes into space. This worsens at night when it is colder and the contrail has a longer lifetime. They can also have a less significant cooling effect, blocking incoming sunlight - but only during daytime. Check out more of the BBC's business stories from the COP26 summit Adjust flight routes so aircraft can avoid areas where they form Teach pilots about new flight plans to avoid contrails Introduce a contrails tax, and give airlines a refund if their flights are contrail-free Contrails can last for seconds, hours or even a day in the atmosphere - and this determines the climate impact of a particular contrail will have. But recent research shows there could be a solution for this overlooked issue. Dr Marc Stettler, transport and environment lecturer at Imperial College London, says changing the altitude offewer than 2% of flights,externalcould potentially reduce contrail-linked climate change by a staggering 59%. ""Tweaking the flight elevation by just a thousand feet can stop some contrails from forming,"" he explains. Adjustments would mean an aircraft could avoid some of the regions of the atmosphere that are cold and humid enough to create contrails in the first place. The HALO research aircraft which measures the impact of contrails ""A relatively small proportion of flights contribute to the majority of climate impact. So if we can alter these flights, we can significantly reduce the climate impact,"" says Dr Stettler. Recent research,externalfrom Prof Christiane Voigt, head of the cloud physics department at Mainz University, Germany, underlines this. She has been conducting trials with the German Aerospace Centre (DLR) to measure and mitigate the impact of contrails. Her team use high-altitude long-range (HALO) G550 research aircraft to gather their data. The aircraft carries wing-mounted instruments measuring contrail properties and the light scattered by radiation. This allows them to evaluate their forecasts' accuracy and investigate the impact of radiation. ""Our results have been really positive. We were able to predict and avoid around 80% of the contrails with little cost,"" she says. Prof Voigt adds that very few flights would have to be deviated to win a ""large climate impact"". Contrail sensors and measuring apparatus on HALO While there were some uncertainties, her team were able to track down most of the contrails and avoid the correct areas. ""We are at the beginning of a race to avoid them. And I have the impression that [companies] such as Lufthansa and Airbus, are really interested, as it is low cost and effective,"" she says. Royal Aeronautical Society fellow, Prof Keith Hayward, is optimistic it may only need a software tweak to adjust many flight plans to avoid contrail creation, and that this could be done at a relatively low cost. Compared to the typical $200m cost of a passenger aircraft or engine changes which can run to $12m, a software change is relatively inexpensive, he says. Prof Hayward says the next challenge is for airlines to work out how altitude changes of a ""few thousand feet"" can be made mid-flight to avoid contrails while also not disrupting passengers' comfort. A pilot would need to spot these in ""sufficient time for an aircraft to adapt gracefully"", he adds. A Flightkeys cockpit system prototype, visualising the cost-optimum speed and altitude range at every point along a flight But Prof Voigt does not believe this is necessarily a problem. She thinks flight comfort could improve as flight paths would avoid some of the sky's water vapour areas - which both form contrails and cause bumpy turbulence. Raimund Zopp, former pilot and co-founder of Austrian flight services software company, Flightkeys, is working on contrail visualisations to programme into flight plan technology. The company plans to include contrail avoidance in their airline customers' flight plan trajectories by 2023. ""Only a very small portion of flights are causing the problem so you only need to change a few flight plans to have a huge effect,"" he says. As a former pilot, Mr Zopp says that from a flight procedure perspective, adding this information would be easy. ""The flight plans get programmed into the navigation of the plane system, but pilots need training on this new contrail aspect of the flight plan profile"". Marc Settler: ""Tweaking the flight elevation by just a thousand feet can stop some contrails from forming"" Any action on climate change that doesn't relate directly to cutting emissions is lower down the priority list for governments and industry, because CO2 is the most important greenhouse gas for most sectors. Yet unlike other sectors, aviation also has very significant non-CO2 impacts. Dr Stettler believes that people have hesitated to reduce contrails by diverting flights because of fears it would be completely unfeasible - that all flights might have to be changed or it would hugely increase fuel consumption. This latest research shows this is not the case. Dr Jarlath Molloy, senior environmental affairs manager at the air traffic service provider, NATS, agrees that up until now, there has been a lack of focus on non-CO2 problems from the entire industry. Yet from an operational perspective, tackling contrails is ""just one extra element the aircraft would have to compute"", he says, and it could even be managed in a similar way to how authorities already orchestrate groups of flights to avoid big winter storms. ""We're exploring the feasibility of it and what we'd have to do to manage flights looking for the same routes"" Dr Molloy adds. Preventing most of the damaging climate impact of contrails could cost less than $1bn a year The Department for Transport says it is ""currently considering"" a range of responses to itsJet Zero consultation,externalon how to ""make the sector cleaner and greener"", and that this strategy ""will aim to address"" aviation's non-CO2 impact. Meanwhile atmospheric scientist Prof Ken Caldiera, from the Carnegie Institution for Science, makes a compelling case. He estimates preventing most of the damaging climate impact of contrails would cost less than $1bn (Â£720m) a year and the net value of the benefit could be more than a thousand times that. ""We know of no comparable climate investment with a similarly high likelihood of success,"" hewrote in the scientific journal Nature.,external So could a financial penalty focus minds in aviation more quickly? Dr Andrew Gettleman of the US National Center for Atmospheric Research says while more research is needed, a contrail tax or avoidance rebate could be introduced if a carbon tax were approved. ""We haven't seen the overall regulatory scheme yet for carbon in aviation, but once we get a larger regime in place for mitigating climate change and reducing carbon - then we can tackle the contrail problem properly.""

How to save energy at home and help the planet,"It is widely accepted the UK needs to revamp its ageing and draughty housing if it is to reach its climate targets. With Britain's buildings accounting for about a fifth of the country's carbon emissions, a raft of upgrades will be needed if the country has any hope of reaching its goal of net zero emissions by 2050. We look at the key things we can do to reduce the carbon footprint of our homes, the cost, and what help the government is offering. New homes will be banned from installing new gas and oil boilers by 2025 and the government wants a ban on new boilers being sold after 2035, although poorer homes will be exempt. There are three main contenders to replace them - heat pumps, hydrogen and district heating. Homeowners in England and Wales will be offered subsidies of Â£7,500 to help them to replace old gas boilers with heat pumps. The Energy Saving Trust says it typically costs about Â£14,000 to install a heat pump, depending on the size of the pump and property and whether other parts of your heating system need to be changed - and they also need high levels of insulation which aren't always possible in the UK's older, solid walled homes. The government is also pioneering trials of hydrogen heating. But there are huge challenges and many believe hydrogen is unlikely to be produced in sufficient quantities to warm many people's homes. District heating, where large pipes are laid in the ground to supply heat from a variety of sources is also a possibility in some areas. Heat pumps: How do they work? One of the most effective ways of cutting your home's emissions is by reducing heat loss through the insulation ofwalls, roofs and floors,external. In an uninsulated home, about a third of heat is lost through the walls, a quarter goes through the roof, about 15% through the floor and the rest out of windows and as a result of draughts. How you go about reducing this will depend on the type of home you live in, says the Energy Saving Trust (EST). Homes built from the 1990s onwards will probably have cavity walls - two walls with a gap in between - and are also likely to have insulation already to keep the heat in. Homes built after the 1920s but before the 1990s are also likely to have cavity walls, but they may not have insulation. In these cases, cavity wall insulation can be added. Older homes from pre-1920 are likely to have solid walls - a single layer of brick or stone. Solid walls can be insulated either from the inside or the outside, but it is a more complicated and expensive process. Costs and savings vary considerably, but a typical installation of cavity wall insulation in a mid-terrace house would cost about Â£1,500, withannual energy savings of Â£155,external. Making doors and windows more energy efficient will also reduce your carbon footprint. One option is to fit double or triple glazing - windows with two or more glass panes in a sealed unit. The costs of double glazing vary hugely. Windows for a semi-detached house that are A-rated, taking in as much heat as they let out, would costabout Â£15,000,external, with energy bill savings of about Â£155 per year compared with a single-glazing. A cheaper option is to install secondary glazing - a second pane of glass inside an existing window - or using heavy curtains to reduce heat loss. Draught-proofing is one of the cheapest and most effective ways to save energy,according to the EST,external. To draught-proof your home, you should block up unwanted gaps that let cold air in and warm air out. Draughts can be tackled in a number of places, most commonly around doors and windows, chimneys, skirting boards and loft-hatches. Just be sure not to block or seal any intentional ventilation needed to keep fresh air flowing. Draught-proofing around windows and doors could save you about Â£90 a year, and draught-proofing an unused chimney could save about Â£65 a year, according to the EST. Energy-efficient lighting and appliances could also help lower your emissions. If you replace all the bulbs in your home with LED lights, you could reduce your carbon dioxide emissions by up to 50kg a year - the equivalent emissions to driving your car about 145 miles, the EST says. When looking for new appliances, such as washing machines and dishwashers, make sure you only buy the size you need, as larger items will use more energy and end up costing you more. Also consider the energy rating of your new appliance and look for the product with the best energy rating for the size you require. You can also reduce energy use by using ""eco"" modes and turning off standby. Environmentalists and leaders across the housing and construction industries have pointed to the many barriers preventing people upgrading their homes. MPs on the Environment Audit Committee have highlighted obstacles that need to be overcome: cost, the age of the housing stock, worries about disruption, and the variety of households - all with different needs.
