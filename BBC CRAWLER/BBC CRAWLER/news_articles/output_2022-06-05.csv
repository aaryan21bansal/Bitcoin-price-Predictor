"Met Police has real problems, Sadiq Khan says","Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the force's new commissioner would need to work on restoring trust and confidence Sadiq Khan has described the Metropolitan Police as a force facing ""real challenges"" and ""real problems"". London's Labour mayor told Sophie Raworth on BBC One's Sunday Morning that evidence of ""systemic sexism, racism, homophobia, discrimination, misogyny"" had emerged in recent months. While he ""recognised the dedicated, decent, brave officers"" on the force he said its new commissioner would need to work at restoring trust and confidence. The role has yet to be filled. Stephen House became acting commissioner when Dame Cressida Dick quit in February after Mr Khan said he had lost confidence in her leadership. Her departure followed a series of scandals, including the murder of Sarah Everard by a serving policeman and her handling of racist and homophobic messages shared by a group of officers at Charing Cross police station. Dame Cressida Dick resigned after Sadiq Khan criticised her handling of racist, misogynist and homophobic messages shared by a group of officers Mr Khan said: ""One of the reasons why i lost confidence in the previous commissioner was my lack of confidence in her plan to address the two big issues. ""Addressing the systemic racism, sexism, homophobia, misogyny, but also the trust and confidence required from our public. ""That's one of the things that they will be checking the new commissioner for."" Met has improved, says departing commissioner Dick Why is it so hard to fix the Metâs toxic culture? The crises and controversies of Cressida Dick When asked if the Met Police was a ""failing force"", Mr Khan said: ""We're losing trust and confidence, so if that's the criteria of measurement, you could say so. ""But actually, in relation to crime going down... we're making huge progress. ""The police have made really good progress in the last six years in reducing those crimes but I can't escape the fact that too many people on our city haven't got the confidence they should have in our police service."" Last year, the Met announced anindependent review of its culture and standardswould be led by Baroness Casey of Blackstock. The force said the review would examine its vetting, recruitment and training procedures, as well as looking into cases of sexual misconduct and sexual abuse allegations where those accused remain in the Met. ""This significant piece of work is part of a range of measures that aim to help restore the trust of Londoners in the aftermath of the horrific murder of Sarah Everard by a Metropolitan Police Officer and other cases that have undermined trust,"" the force said at the time.

""We've been planning this since January,"" said Ms Bickley, adding that she still expected a big turnout for the event. It's so exciting, we had a massive venue, it was going to a festival spirit, but obviously because of weather issues we've had to relocate to the community centre. There's going to be at least five hundred people, I don't know how we're going to fit them all in, but it's so brilliant to see everybody here smiling and bringing the community back together.""

Easyjet cancels 80 flights as disruption continues,"Airlines including EasyJet and Wizz Air have cancelled dozens of flights as UK air travel disruption continues. EasyJet said it had cut 80 flights on Sunday, and apologised to customers for the disruption. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC the aviation industry cut too many jobs during the coronavirus pandemic and it must not oversell flights. He said he wanted airlines to automatically compensate passengers. Why are flights being cancelled? What are my rights if my flight is cancelled? Passengers have faced a raft of UK flight cancellations causing disruptions for many families on half-term holidays. Ten-year-old Noah and his younger sister Beau won't be in school on Monday morning after a cancelled EasyJet flight left their family stranded in Dalyan, Turkey. Their mother, Emma, a hairdresser has had to cancel clients by text. The family of six, including Emma's parents, spent 10 hours on Saturday night at the airport waiting to see if they would be able to fly out as planned, before finally being bussed back to the hotel at 4.30am. EasyJet offered them a flight on Thursday to Liverpool, but their car is parked at Gatwick. ""The [EasyJet] app literally says rearrange your flight or get a refund,"" says father Scott. ""So we've just spend Â£3,000 on a flight home tomorrow night... flying to Stanstead."" Scott and Emma have spent Â£3,000 on flights home, money they hope they'll be able to claim back EasyJet said it had cancelled about 80 flights on Sunday ""due to the ongoing challenging operating environment"". ""We are very sorry and fully understand the disruption this will have caused for our customers,"" the airline said, adding it was doing everything possible to get passengers to their destinations. It said it had extended its customer service opening hours from 07:00 to 23:00, and was helping those affected find hotel accommodation. Mr Shapps told BBC One's Sunday Morning programme that labour shortages were behind the travel disruption, resulting in airlines ""finding it difficult to get people on board"". ""When someone has bought a ticket for a flight, they've every right to expect that flight will take off, and not find that flight has been cancelled,"" he said. ""Airlines should be cautious about not overselling those flights, [and] where there are problems they need to fix them quickly."" He said the government had provided Â£8bn of support to the sector during the pandemic, along with furlough support, so decisions to cut staff had been made by the industry. Mr Shapps added that airlines had ""cut too deep"" during the coronavirus pandemic. ""Clearly [the airlines] have been taken by surprise by the way in which people have returned to travel after two years of being locked down,"" he said. He added that he wanted a ""proper charter"" for passengers so they could get ""quick and straightforward compensation or be put on other flights"". Mr Shapps said he wanted a similar system to ""Delay Repay"" train passenger refunds ""where it's an automated process"". However, he again rejected the idea of easing aviation labour shortages by relaxing immigration requirements. Airlineshave called on the government to issue special immigration visasto allow them to recruit overseas workers in the short term, as was done for the haulage and meat processing industries. That idea was backed by London's Labour mayor Sadiq Khan who said airport jobs should be opened up to people from the European Union. ""This is self-inflicted from the government. This is about Brexit plus Covid."" ""What we don't want is this spring misery turned into summer misery,"" he said. However, Mr Shapps said after the government eased immigration rules in the haulage industry only 27 lorry drivers had come over from the European Union to help ease the chronic shortage, which instead had been alleviated by government measures. Gatwick Airport said that 52 departures and 30 arrivals were cancelled on Sunday. The majority were EasyJet flights, but British Airways, Wizz Air and Vueling were also affected. Flights from Barcelona, Nice, Madrid, Belfast, Geneva, Corfu, Faro in Portugal and Glasgow were among those cancelled. A Gatwick spokesperson said the airport was ""operating normally"" but would be busy with 830 flights. London Luton Airport flights disrupted by power cut Travel expert Simon Calder said that on a typical day you would expect to see half a dozen flights being cancelled to and from the UK, with those spread over all airlines. He said in addition about 3,000 passengers heading for Luton on Sunday had been diverted after a power failure affected air traffic control systems. British Airways declined to comment. Wizz Air issued a statement saying it was doing as much as it could to help passengers reach their destinations. It said several things were causing ""operational instability"" in the travel industry, including staff shortages within air traffic control, ground operations and baggage handling, security and across airports. It offered customers affected its ""sincere apologies"" and said they would be offered alternative flights with Wizz Air, a full refund or 120% in airline credit, which it aimed to process within one week.

Wales edge Ukraine to end 64-year World Cup wait,"Ukraine had good chances to score but could not quite find the breakthrough Wales overcame another monumental effort from Ukraine to qualify for their first World Cup since 1958 on a night of high emotion and drama in Cardiff. Having beaten Scotland in an emotionally draining semi-final four days earlier, the Ukrainians - with the backdrop of their country's war with Russia - were deeply impressive once again but fell just short in their attempt to reach only a second World Cup in their history. Instead, it was Wales who achieved that feat at a delirious Cardiff City Stadium. Their winning goal came against the run of play as Gareth Bale's first-half free-kick was inadvertently headed in by Ukraine captain Andriy Yarmolenko, a particularly cruel way for the visitors to concede having dominated before then. Both teams tired but threw players forward in a chaotic second half, with Bale wasting a golden opportunity and substitute Brennan Johnson hitting the post for Wales. Ukraine also had several chances to equalise but were repelled by the phenomenal goalkeeping of Wayne Hennessey and defending of Ben Davies. Bale hails 'greatest result' in Welsh football history Wales comfort Ukraine amid World Cup cheer Ukraine 'gave everything' in defeat - Zinchenko This was not a vintage Welsh performance but they played with great resolve, and the scenes of celebration inside a deafening Cardiff City Stadium spoke of how cathartic it is for this footballing nation to rid itself of its 64-year World Cup drought. Now Wales can finally look forward to being a part of football's greatest competition in November, where England, the United States and Iran await in their group in Qatar. As for this Ukrainian team, playing to the backdrop of Russia's invasion of their homeland, they have been an inspiration. They were cheered on in Cardiff by their passionate supporters, including 100 refugees who were given tickets for free by the Football Association of Wales, while home fans showed their appreciation for the away side with warm applause before kick-off. However, Wales' mantra in the build-up to this game - as cold as it may have sounded - was that they had to take the emotion out of this occasion and temporarily put their compassion to one side. And they did it to realise their own, long-held dream. World Cup play-off: Wales v Ukraine action and reaction Your starting Wales XI to face Ukraine Wales celebrated wildly at the full-time whistle in Cardiff Since their only other World Cup appearance in 1958, Welsh football history has been littered with tales of near misses. From Scotland in 1977 and 1985 to Romania in 1993, Wales have stood on the brink of history before - only to stumble at the final hurdle. But these are different times. This is Wales' golden era, in which their players are not burdened by that past. Qualifying for Euro 2016 ended their 58-year wait for a major tournament and reaching a first semi-final in France took Welsh football to new heights. Then they followed that success by qualifying for Euro 2020 - but a World Cup is another level again. And while this Wales side might not be shackled by the memories of previous failures, Robert Page's men were never going to make it easy for themselves. Wales started in a panic, hurrying into tackles and picking up yellow cards for Joe Allen and Daniel James inside two minutes as Ukraine controlled the early exchanges. The visitors dominated possession and forced Hennessey into a flurry of early saves, while Oleksandr Zinchenko had a goal disallowed after shooting from a free-kick taken too quickly. While Ukraine's noisy blue and yellow contingent enjoyed their team's vibrant start, a sense of unease spread through the home fans at Cardiff City Stadium. Their anxiety increased as Zinchenko, orchestrating matters artfully in midfield, called Hennessey into action yet again with a firm left-footed shot from long range. Ukraine were devastated after their World Cup dream - and the cheer it had given their war-torn nation - ended And yet for all the Ukrainian pressure, it was Bale - who else - who conjured the moment, with some luck, which led to Wales' opening goal. Peripheral for the first half an hour, the Wales captain lashed a free-kick towards the Ukrainian goal but, as the ball seemed to be drifting wide, it was steered in by the diving Yarmolenko. Ukraine's skipper thought he would have a chance to redeem himself when he appeared to be tripped by Allen inside the Wales box but, after a VAR check, no penalty was given. Fortuitous as the goal might have been, Wales' lead meant that Ukraine attacked with abandon in the second half and left themselves vulnerable defensively. Aaron Ramsey had a glorious opportunity as Kieffer Moore pulled the ball back to him inside the Ukrainian penalty area, but the Juventus midfielder miscued his shot wide. The game soon become so open it was ragged, both sides exchanging chances like two punch-drunk boxers trading blows. Hennessey blocked instinctively from Viktor Tsygankov, before Davies slid in to deny Yarmolenko in a goal-saving intervention that brought to mind his block against Slovakia at Euro 2016. Johnson came on to hit the post and, moments later, Bale could only shoot straight at Ukraine keeper Georgiy Buschchan from close range. The longer Wales went without scoring a second goal, the more the nerves crept back in as Ukraine exerted more pressure. Hennessey pulled off a majestic, flying save to deny Artem Dovbyk and, the more time ticked away, the more desperate the Ukrainian attacks became. Their commitment was faultless but so was Wales' as they held firm to free a nation from its past.

He added serving the public was what ""gets my mother up in the morning"" and thanked her on behalf of the world.

Jubilee concert shows love for the Royals Street parties and celebrations in pictures The Queen did not attend Saturday's concert, but she opened the show with a secretly pre-recorded comic sketch featuring Paddington Bear. In it, the two icons shared a chaotic cream tea at Buckingham Palace, with the famous bear gulping down his tea straight from the teapot and accidentally spraying a splodge of cream at the footman. He then revealed that he always carries an emergency stash of his favourite treat: a marmalade sandwich. Smiling and laughing, the Queen responded ""so do I"", before opening her bag and saying: ""I keep mine in here."" The segment brought back memories of the Queen's rendezvous with James Bond at the London 2012 Olympic opening ceremony - in which the monarch appeared to swoop into the stadium from the skies with the fictional secret agent. This video can not be played From June 2022: The Queen meets Paddington Bear for Party at the Palace Prince William also spoke at the event, focusing on his family's record of raising concerns about the planet and his optimism people would unite to protect it. The star-studded concert saw 22,000 people fill The Mall to see performances from an array of music artists, as well as appearances from the stars of stage and screen, and the sporting world. There were songs from Sir Elton John, George Ezra, Craig David, Duran Duran, Alicia Keys and Eurovision runner-up Sam Ryder, while Sir Rod Stewart's performance of ""Sweet Caroline"" had Prince William and his family swaying in their seats.

The show was closed by Diana Ross, with her first live performance in the UK in 15 years. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their children Charlotte and George had front row seats, while Boris Johnson and his wife Carrie sat further back Thousands of people filled The Mall to watch the concert Taking to the stage, Prince Charles remarked on what he said was an ""outpouring of warmth and affection over the Jubilee weekend"". ""On behalf of us all, I wanted to pay my own tribute to your lifetime of selfless service."" He went on to talk about the Queen's ""strength and stay"", his father, theDuke of Edinburgh, who died last year. He said he was sure he was there in spirit. ""My papa would have enjoyed the show and joined us wholeheartedly in celebrating all you continue to do for your country and your people,"" he said. Images of the Queen over the decades was projected on to Buckingham Palace during the show He went on to say that the Queen continued to make history - and had made the Commonwealth an important force for good. ""And there was still time for fun amongst the work,"" he added. She had pledged to serve her whole life, and she continued to deliver, he said. ""You have been with us in our difficult times. And you bring us together to celebrate moments of pride, joy and happiness,"" he said. As pictures of the Queen throughout her reign were projected on to the front of Buckingham Palace, he said: ""These pictures on your house are the story of your life - and ours. ""So, Your Majesty, that is why we all say: 'Thank you.'"" The Queen's grandson, Prince William, spoke at the event during a section of the show dedicated to environmental issues. It opened with words from Sir David Attenborough, and as images of the natural world were projected on to Buckingham Palace and music from Hans Zimmer was played, the crowd heard archive audio of the Queen speaking about the future of the planet in 1989. Prince William spoke in front of a backdrop of images of forests and oceans Prince William, who champions environmental issues, said that throughout the Queen's lifetime, the natural world had become more fragile. The Queen had spent decades making the case for taking better care of the world, he said, and restoring it has never been more urgent. ""Together, if we harness the very best of humankind, and restore our planet, we will protect it for our children, for our grandchildren and for future generations to come,"" he said. This was a deeply personal speech by Prince Charles - addressing ""mummy"". It was intimate and simple, despite the grand setting. It was a son thanking a mother who had persevered for 70 years rather than a speech commending a head of state. It was also a reminder of how long Prince Charles and the Queen have been there together, soldiering on side by side. This is also the 70th anniversary of Prince Charles becoming heir to the throne. In this family moment he remembered his ""papa"", the Duke of Edinburgh, who died last year. If Prince Charles was looking back on changes over 70 years, Prince William was looking forward, with a rallying cry for the conservation work that is close to his heart. In the London twilight, it was framed as a message of hope. Invoking the Queen, he said: ""Like her, I am an optimist."" Diana Ross's performance was lit up by a massive glitterball Earlier in the day, the members of the Royal Family spent the day at events across the UK. Prince William and his wife the Duchess of Cambridge met performers and crew ahead of a special show in Cardiff.

Concert shows love for the royals,"This video can not be played Watch: Queen, Diana Ross, Duran Duran and more perform at the Platinum Party at the Palace At most pop concerts, the audience don't turn their backs on the stage. But this wasn't a normal pop concert, and this wasn't a normal audience. For most of the 22,000 fans attending The Platinum Party at the Palace, the Royal Family were the real stars. Ten minutes before the show started, Prince Charles walked the short distance from Buckingham Palace to the temporary grandstand, waving cheerfully at the crowd as they shouted ""Charles! Charles! Sir! Sir!"" and zoomed their camera phones in to get a better glimpse of the heir to the throne. And while acts like Queen, Elbow and Duran Duran took to the stage, the audience craned their necks to see what was happening in the royal box. Some even brought binoculars. This video can not be played From June 2022: The Queen meets Paddington Bear for Party at the Palace The concert began with a celebration of the Queen's love of humour - as she shared a pot of tea with Paddington Bear in a pre-filmed, heart-warming sketch. Immediately afterwards, Queen (the band) kicked off the music in style, embellishing We Will Rock You with military pomp, courtesy of the Royal Marine Drummers. But many other acts seemed to leave the royal-watchers in the audience mystified. ""I'm not really into gigs,"" admitted one man standing next to me. ""Who's that?"" shouted another when host Lee Mack introduced chart-topping dance act Sigala. Pop royalty and Paddington star at Jubilee concert In pictures: Stars throw party for Jubilee Mummy laughs and cries with us all, says Charles And when Jax Jones took to the stage, were the crowd nodding in time to his slick house-pop, or in acknowledgement of his opening song, You Don't Know Me? More familiar artists fared better. Sir Rod Stewart received a hero's welcome as he ran through Baby Jane; George Ezra's Shotgun triggered an enthusiastic sing-along; and when Mack announced ""please go crazy for Duran Duran"", the crowd duly obliged. Sir Rod Stewart made full use of the four interconnected stages at the front of Buckingham Palace Other highlights included Elbow, who performed One Day Like This with a choir of refugees representing more than 30 countries; and US star Alicia Keys, who retooled her songs of female empowerment as a tribute to the monarch's endurance. As she sang at the piano, the words ""strength"" and ""superwoman"" were projected onto the facade of Buckingham Palace. ""Is this girl on fire?"" asked the singer, introducing a song of the same name, before declaring: ""Yes, Queen!"" - cheekily appropriating a term that originated in black and LGBTQ club cultures in the US. Alicia Keys played a medley of hits including Superwoman, Girl On Fire and Empire State Of Mind Sam Ryder also impressed with a full-throated rendition of his Eurovision smash Space Man, which achieved interstellar orbit via a call-and-response chorus and a squealing guitar solo. Sir Elton John's rendition of Your Song, taped in the red drawing room of Windsor Castle, was genuinely moving. And so, to my surprise, was the moment that drones floating above Buckingham Palace created an image of the Queen's beloved corgis. There were also pre-taped messages from stellar names like Sir Paul McCartney, who said: ""I love you like many other people, so congratulations and thank you for 70 beautiful years""; and Michelle Obama, who thanked the Queen for her ""extraordinary kindness towards our children"". Sam Ryder was dressed for the occasion in a union jack outfit For viewers at home, in particular, it was a slick, encyclopaedic journey through seven decades of rock and pop - with a few gaps (counter-cultural movements like punk and Britpop didn't get a showing). And, as with all events on this scale, there were inevitably some moments that didn't quite work. Diana Ross struggled to find her key as she sang Chain Reaction (viewers at home, apparently spared this moment, complained her microphone was too quiet); and George Ezra seemingly self-censored the lyric ""You better throw a party on the day that I die"", drawing more attention than if he'd left it intact. Diana Ross closed the show with a stunning rendition of Ain't No Mountain High Enough Rod Stewart introduced a rendition of Sweet Caroline - chosen as a tribute to the Queenby the audience of BBC Radio 2- by announcing: ""This isn't a fun one to sing but the BBC made me sing it. Make it fun for me."" The Royal Family did their best, singing along and waving flags in time to the Neil Diamond classic. There were also a couple of references to politics. Standing in front of Buckingham Palace's front gates, Mack joked: ""Finally we can say the words 'party' and 'gate' and it's a positive,"" prompting jeers for Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was in the royal box. Later, Stephen Fry referred to the number of prime ministers the Queen has ""tolerated"" during her seven-decade reign. The Prince of Wales read a touching tribute to his mother Fry also jokingly asked: ""How many concerts of raucously loud music has she had to endure outside her house?"" The Queen watched similar events 10 and 20 years ago, but was unable to attend this concert in person, having already missed the Epsom Derby earlier in the day and a service of Thanksgiving on Friday. Prince Charles did speak on stage, explaining that his mother had missed the show with ""intense regret"". But it is hard to know what she would have made of it all. We do know her favourite songs predate the rock era.A playlist of her top 10, released to mark her 90th birthday in 2016, includes Dame Vera Lynn's White Cliffs of Dover and Fred Astaire's Cheek to Cheek alongside hymns and songs from musical theatre. So she probably would have enjoyed Andrea Bocelli's Nessun Dorma and Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber's medley of theatre hits more than Sigala's Came Here With Love. Pop singer Mabel gave one of the night's most energetic performances But, as Prince Charles pointed out towards the end of the two-and-a-half hour extravaganza, that wasn't necessarily the point. ""The scale of this evening's celebration - and the outpouring of warmth and affection over this whole Jubilee weekend - is our way of saying thank you,"" he said, affectionately addressing the monarch as ""mummy"". He then encouraged the crowd to make a noise loud enough for her to hear in Windsor Castle, 20 miles away. And so the audience turned away from the stage one last time, facing west as they gave the Queen three cheers.

"Wales edge Ukraine to end 64-year World Cup waitWales reach a World Cup for first time since 1958, beating Ukraine 1-0 in play-off final.","Ukraine had good chances to score but could not quite find the breakthrough Wales overcame another monumental effort from Ukraine to qualify for their first World Cup since 1958 on a night of high emotion and drama in Cardiff. Having beaten Scotland in an emotionally draining semi-final four days earlier, the Ukrainians - with the backdrop of their country's war with Russia - were deeply impressive once again but fell just short in their attempt to reach only a second World Cup in their history. Instead, it was Wales who achieved that feat at a delirious Cardiff City Stadium. Their winning goal came against the run of play as Gareth Bale's first-half free-kick was inadvertently headed in by Ukraine captain Andriy Yarmolenko, a particularly cruel way for the visitors to concede having dominated before then. Both teams tired but threw players forward in a chaotic second half, with Bale wasting a golden opportunity and substitute Brennan Johnson hitting the post for Wales. Ukraine also had several chances to equalise but were repelled by the phenomenal goalkeeping of Wayne Hennessey and defending of Ben Davies. Bale hails 'greatest result' in Welsh football history Wales comfort Ukraine amid World Cup cheer Ukraine 'gave everything' in defeat - Zinchenko This was not a vintage Welsh performance but they played with great resolve, and the scenes of celebration inside a deafening Cardiff City Stadium spoke of how cathartic it is for this footballing nation to rid itself of its 64-year World Cup drought. Now Wales can finally look forward to being a part of football's greatest competition in November, where England, the United States and Iran await in their group in Qatar. As for this Ukrainian team, playing to the backdrop of Russia's invasion of their homeland, they have been an inspiration. They were cheered on in Cardiff by their passionate supporters, including 100 refugees who were given tickets for free by the Football Association of Wales, while home fans showed their appreciation for the away side with warm applause before kick-off. However, Wales' mantra in the build-up to this game - as cold as it may have sounded - was that they had to take the emotion out of this occasion and temporarily put their compassion to one side. And they did it to realise their own, long-held dream. World Cup play-off: Wales v Ukraine action and reaction Your starting Wales XI to face Ukraine Wales celebrated wildly at the full-time whistle in Cardiff Since their only other World Cup appearance in 1958, Welsh football history has been littered with tales of near misses. From Scotland in 1977 and 1985 to Romania in 1993, Wales have stood on the brink of history before - only to stumble at the final hurdle. But these are different times. This is Wales' golden era, in which their players are not burdened by that past. Qualifying for Euro 2016 ended their 58-year wait for a major tournament and reaching a first semi-final in France took Welsh football to new heights. Then they followed that success by qualifying for Euro 2020 - but a World Cup is another level again. And while this Wales side might not be shackled by the memories of previous failures, Robert Page's men were never going to make it easy for themselves. Wales started in a panic, hurrying into tackles and picking up yellow cards for Joe Allen and Daniel James inside two minutes as Ukraine controlled the early exchanges. The visitors dominated possession and forced Hennessey into a flurry of early saves, while Oleksandr Zinchenko had a goal disallowed after shooting from a free-kick taken too quickly. While Ukraine's noisy blue and yellow contingent enjoyed their team's vibrant start, a sense of unease spread through the home fans at Cardiff City Stadium. Their anxiety increased as Zinchenko, orchestrating matters artfully in midfield, called Hennessey into action yet again with a firm left-footed shot from long range. Ukraine were devastated after their World Cup dream - and the cheer it had given their war-torn nation - ended And yet for all the Ukrainian pressure, it was Bale - who else - who conjured the moment, with some luck, which led to Wales' opening goal. Peripheral for the first half an hour, the Wales captain lashed a free-kick towards the Ukrainian goal but, as the ball seemed to be drifting wide, it was steered in by the diving Yarmolenko. Ukraine's skipper thought he would have a chance to redeem himself when he appeared to be tripped by Allen inside the Wales box but, after a VAR check, no penalty was given. Fortuitous as the goal might have been, Wales' lead meant that Ukraine attacked with abandon in the second half and left themselves vulnerable defensively. Aaron Ramsey had a glorious opportunity as Kieffer Moore pulled the ball back to him inside the Ukrainian penalty area, but the Juventus midfielder miscued his shot wide. The game soon become so open it was ragged, both sides exchanging chances like two punch-drunk boxers trading blows. Hennessey blocked instinctively from Viktor Tsygankov, before Davies slid in to deny Yarmolenko in a goal-saving intervention that brought to mind his block against Slovakia at Euro 2016. Johnson came on to hit the post and, moments later, Bale could only shoot straight at Ukraine keeper Georgiy Buschchan from close range. The longer Wales went without scoring a second goal, the more the nerves crept back in as Ukraine exerted more pressure. Hennessey pulled off a majestic, flying save to deny Artem Dovbyk and, the more time ticked away, the more desperate the Ukrainian attacks became. Their commitment was faultless but so was Wales' as they held firm to free a nation from its past.

Easyjet cancels 80 flights as disruption continuesAirlines continue to cancel flights as travel secretary says industry must solve labour shortages.,"Airlines including EasyJet and Wizz Air have cancelled dozens of flights as UK air travel disruption continues. EasyJet said it had cut 80 flights on Sunday, and apologised to customers for the disruption. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told the BBC the aviation industry cut too many jobs during the coronavirus pandemic and it must not oversell flights. He said he wanted airlines to automatically compensate passengers. Why are flights being cancelled? What are my rights if my flight is cancelled? Passengers have faced a raft of UK flight cancellations causing disruptions for many families on half-term holidays. Ten-year-old Noah and his younger sister Beau won't be in school on Monday morning after a cancelled EasyJet flight left their family stranded in Dalyan, Turkey. Their mother, Emma, a hairdresser has had to cancel clients by text. The family of six, including Emma's parents, spent 10 hours on Saturday night at the airport waiting to see if they would be able to fly out as planned, before finally being bussed back to the hotel at 4.30am. EasyJet offered them a flight on Thursday to Liverpool, but their car is parked at Gatwick. ""The [EasyJet] app literally says rearrange your flight or get a refund,"" says father Scott. ""So we've just spend Â£3,000 on a flight home tomorrow night... flying to Stanstead."" Scott and Emma have spent Â£3,000 on flights home, money they hope they'll be able to claim back EasyJet said it had cancelled about 80 flights on Sunday ""due to the ongoing challenging operating environment"". ""We are very sorry and fully understand the disruption this will have caused for our customers,"" the airline said, adding it was doing everything possible to get passengers to their destinations. It said it had extended its customer service opening hours from 07:00 to 23:00, and was helping those affected find hotel accommodation. Mr Shapps told BBC One's Sunday Morning programme that labour shortages were behind the travel disruption, resulting in airlines ""finding it difficult to get people on board"". ""When someone has bought a ticket for a flight, they've every right to expect that flight will take off, and not find that flight has been cancelled,"" he said. ""Airlines should be cautious about not overselling those flights, [and] where there are problems they need to fix them quickly."" He said the government had provided Â£8bn of support to the sector during the pandemic, along with furlough support, so decisions to cut staff had been made by the industry. Mr Shapps added that airlines had ""cut too deep"" during the coronavirus pandemic. ""Clearly [the airlines] have been taken by surprise by the way in which people have returned to travel after two years of being locked down,"" he said. He added that he wanted a ""proper charter"" for passengers so they could get ""quick and straightforward compensation or be put on other flights"". Mr Shapps said he wanted a similar system to ""Delay Repay"" train passenger refunds ""where it's an automated process"". However, he again rejected the idea of easing aviation labour shortages by relaxing immigration requirements. Airlineshave called on the government to issue special immigration visasto allow them to recruit overseas workers in the short term, as was done for the haulage and meat processing industries. That idea was backed by London's Labour mayor Sadiq Khan who said airport jobs should be opened up to people from the European Union. ""This is self-inflicted from the government. This is about Brexit plus Covid."" ""What we don't want is this spring misery turned into summer misery,"" he said. However, Mr Shapps said after the government eased immigration rules in the haulage industry only 27 lorry drivers had come over from the European Union to help ease the chronic shortage, which instead had been alleviated by government measures. Gatwick Airport said that 52 departures and 30 arrivals were cancelled on Sunday. The majority were EasyJet flights, but British Airways, Wizz Air and Vueling were also affected. Flights from Barcelona, Nice, Madrid, Belfast, Geneva, Corfu, Faro in Portugal and Glasgow were among those cancelled. A Gatwick spokesperson said the airport was ""operating normally"" but would be busy with 830 flights. London Luton Airport flights disrupted by power cut Travel expert Simon Calder said that on a typical day you would expect to see half a dozen flights being cancelled to and from the UK, with those spread over all airlines. He said in addition about 3,000 passengers heading for Luton on Sunday had been diverted after a power failure affected air traffic control systems. British Airways declined to comment. Wizz Air issued a statement saying it was doing as much as it could to help passengers reach their destinations. It said several things were causing ""operational instability"" in the travel industry, including staff shortages within air traffic control, ground operations and baggage handling, security and across airports. It offered customers affected its ""sincere apologies"" and said they would be offered alternative flights with Wizz Air, a full refund or 120% in airline credit, which it aimed to process within one week.

Wales and Ukraine set for 'massive' play-off final,"Ukraine had good chances to score but could not quite find the breakthrough Wales overcame another monumental effort from Ukraine to qualify for their first World Cup since 1958 on a night of high emotion and drama in Cardiff. Having beaten Scotland in an emotionally draining semi-final four days earlier, the Ukrainians - with the backdrop of their country's war with Russia - were deeply impressive once again but fell just short in their attempt to reach only a second World Cup in their history. Instead, it was Wales who achieved that feat at a delirious Cardiff City Stadium.

Hennessey pulled off a majestic, flying save to deny Artem Dovbyk and, the more time ticked away, the more desperate the Ukrainian attacks became. Their commitment was faultless but so was Wales' as they held firm to free a nation from its past.

Wales 'knows world against us' in Ukraine play-off,"This video can not be played DJ Katie Owen, says supporters will be singing their ""hearts out"" on Sunday. Wales' men's football team knows ""most of the world will be against them"" on Sunday as they host Ukraine for a place in the World Cup in Qatar. Wales manager Robert Page said ""most of the world want Ukraine to get through"", in solidarity afterRussia's invasion of Ukrainethat has killed thousands. Ukrainian refugees in the UKhave been offered tickets to the game in Cardiff. Wales hope to put64 years of World Cup hurtbehind them as they bid to qualify for theirfirst finals since 1958. The Football Association of Wales has invited the UK's Ukrainian ambassador to the match, while the Welsh government has given the visiting team and their delegates an official ""warm Welsh welcome"" in support to the people ofUkraine in the war with Russia. Five ways Russiaâs war in Ukraine may play out What does Putin want from Russia's war in Ukraine? In maps: Battles raging in east Ukraine What might swing the Ukraine war? Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has sent a message of support to the Welsh team, but added this game was an ""opportunity for us to reaffirm our support for Ukraine as it fights Russia's unprovoked and brutal act of war"". Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey will lead Wales' World Cup charge in Sunday's play-off Mr Drakeford went on to say: ""It would be fantastic for the squad and the Welsh supporters to have our team competing in the World Cup in November."" Page, Wales' caretaker boss because of full-time managerRyan Giggs' ongoing absence, has admitted that all the neutral fans will want Ukraine to win. Ukraine fans made their feelings known in Wednesday's play-off semi-final win in Scotland ""Theywon the Eurovision Song Contestbecause they had the backing of the world,"" said Page. ""If we could click our fingers and take away the pain the Ukraine are going through, we'd do it in a heartbeat. But when it comes to football and the whistle goes, we'll want to win that game. Business is business. This video can not be played Wales defender Ben Davies said it can feel ""insensitive"" to play a football game when opponents Ukraine are at war at home ""We've put ourselves in a good position - 1958 is a long time to wait. Opportunities like this don't come around every day."" Ukraine beat Scotland 3-1 on Wednesdayto set-up Sunday's World Cup play-off final with Wales, and their star player Oleksandr Zinchenko has said it will be a ""massive game"" for everyone in his country. First Minister Mark Drakeford said he stands firmly with Ukraine in the war with Russia ""Everyone knows the situation in Ukraine... and we need to show the performances of our lives,"" said the Manchester City player. ""We dream as a team to be in the World Cup and we have one more game and we need to win it."" Welsh Secretary Simon Hart has also wished an ""extraordinarily talented Wales team"" well, saying qualifying for a first World Cup in 64 years ""would be a truly historic moment for Welsh sport. But he added: ""As much as I want a Wales win, my heart also goes out to the Ukrainian team over the ongoing situation in their country. The play-off is at the Cardiff City Stadium where Wales are unbeaten in 18 games - a run stretching back to 2018 ""While there can be only one winner on the pitch, the Welsh nation will continue to stand in solidarity with the people of Ukraine."" People inWales have so far raised millions of poundsfor theUkraine humanitarian fund,externaland, of the14 million Ukraine people displacedby the conflict, Wales has housedalmost 2,000 refugees,external- with more than3,300 visas approved. One fan is making the round trip of more than 8,500 miles to be in Cardiff - despite flying over to the UK without a ticket. Rhys Davies moved to Canada after falling in love with the country while playing rugby there Rhys Davies travelled with his wife and three young children from Edmonton in Canada in the desperate hope of finding a ticket - and his gamble has paid off. ""I was lucky enough to have good family members to save me a ticket,"" said the 37-year-old electrician, who moved to Canada from Llandovery, in Carmarthenshire, 15 years ago. ""I'm looking forward to it and hoping Wales come through with a victory."" Rhys has brought his whole family back to Wales with him so he can try and be at Sunday's game Rhys, whose first Wales game was theirmemorable win over Italy in 2002,externaland whose hero is thelate captain Gary Speed, normally watches Welsh sporting games in a pub with friends in Alberta.

Tim Hartley, whose first Wales game was theirEuropean Championship play-off against Yugoslaviain 1976, hasn't missed a Wales game for 20 years. And although Wales qualified for the Euros in 2016 and 2020 - reaching the semi-finals and last 16 respectively - Tim knows qualifying for the World Cup is the big one. Tim Hartley helps a Welsh fans' charity that raises funds for projects in countries who Wales are playing ""The whole world is going to be rooting for Ukraine except for us, so it's going to be difficult,"" said the author from Cardiff. ""It's great to see Ukraine playing football but let's be realistic, we want to get to the World Cup finals."" This video can not be played Comedian Elis James explains how Wales made it to their only World Cup Wales haven't played at football's World Cup finals for 64 years - the longest drought of any team in Europe. In fact, only Cuba and Indonesia - who played at the 1938 finals in France - have gone longer than Wales without qualifying for another World Cup.

"Met Police has real problems, Sadiq Khan saysLondon's mayor says the force's new commissioner needs to work on restoring trust and confidence.London","Mayor of London Sadiq Khan said the force's new commissioner would need to work on restoring trust and confidence Sadiq Khan has described the Metropolitan Police as a force facing ""real challenges"" and ""real problems"". London's Labour mayor told Sophie Raworth on BBC One's Sunday Morning that evidence of ""systemic sexism, racism, homophobia, discrimination, misogyny"" had emerged in recent months. While he ""recognised the dedicated, decent, brave officers"" on the force he said its new commissioner would need to work at restoring trust and confidence. The role has yet to be filled. Stephen House became acting commissioner when Dame Cressida Dick quit in February after Mr Khan said he had lost confidence in her leadership. Her departure followed a series of scandals, including the murder of Sarah Everard by a serving policeman and her handling of racist and homophobic messages shared by a group of officers at Charing Cross police station. Dame Cressida Dick resigned after Sadiq Khan criticised her handling of racist, misogynist and homophobic messages shared by a group of officers Mr Khan said: ""One of the reasons why i lost confidence in the previous commissioner was my lack of confidence in her plan to address the two big issues. ""Addressing the systemic racism, sexism, homophobia, misogyny, but also the trust and confidence required from our public. ""That's one of the things that they will be checking the new commissioner for."" Met has improved, says departing commissioner Dick Why is it so hard to fix the Metâs toxic culture? The crises and controversies of Cressida Dick When asked if the Met Police was a ""failing force"", Mr Khan said: ""We're losing trust and confidence, so if that's the criteria of measurement, you could say so. ""But actually, in relation to crime going down... we're making huge progress. ""The police have made really good progress in the last six years in reducing those crimes but I can't escape the fact that too many people on our city haven't got the confidence they should have in our police service."" Last year, the Met announced anindependent review of its culture and standardswould be led by Baroness Casey of Blackstock. The force said the review would examine its vetting, recruitment and training procedures, as well as looking into cases of sexual misconduct and sexual abuse allegations where those accused remain in the Met. ""This significant piece of work is part of a range of measures that aim to help restore the trust of Londoners in the aftermath of the horrific murder of Sarah Everard by a Metropolitan Police Officer and other cases that have undermined trust,"" the force said at the time.

Public advised to avoid Tube travel during strike,"Transport for London has advised people not to travel ""unless necessary"" Transport for London has advised people to avoid travelling on the network on Monday due to a planned tube strike. Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) are due to walk out for 24 hours. The RMT said the strike was over proposals for 600 job losses, changes to working agreements and pensions. TfL said no proposals had been tabled on pensions or terms and conditions, and nobody would lose their jobs due to the proposals it had set out. The transport organisation has proposed not replacing up to 600 posts when they become vacant as part of plans to achieve financial sustainability. TfL said customers should ""check before they travel"" due to station closures TfL said it expected ""severe disruption"" from the start of service on Monday to 08:00 BST on Tuesday. Many stations, especially those in central and south London, will be closed and others might only operate for limited periods. Other services, including DLR, London Overground and Trams, are not affected by the industrial action but could be busier than normal. Andy Lord, TfL's chief operating officer, said: ""I'd like to apologise to London for the impact this strike will have on journeys.

"Public advised to avoid Tube travel during strikeTransport for London says it expects ""severe disruption"" due to planned strike action on Monday.","Transport for London has advised people not to travel ""unless necessary"" Transport for London has advised people to avoid travelling on the network on Monday due to a planned tube strike. Members of the Rail, Maritime and Transport union (RMT) are due to walk out for 24 hours. The RMT said the strike was over proposals for 600 job losses, changes to working agreements and pensions. TfL said no proposals had been tabled on pensions or terms and conditions, and nobody would lose their jobs due to the proposals it had set out. The transport organisation has proposed not replacing up to 600 posts when they become vacant as part of plans to achieve financial sustainability. TfL said customers should ""check before they travel"" due to station closures TfL said it expected ""severe disruption"" from the start of service on Monday to 08:00 BST on Tuesday. Many stations, especially those in central and south London, will be closed and others might only operate for limited periods. Other services, including DLR, London Overground and Trams, are not affected by the industrial action but could be busier than normal. Andy Lord, TfL's chief operating officer, said: ""I'd like to apologise to London for the impact this strike will have on journeys. ""We know it's going to be damaging to London and the economy at a time when public transport is playing a crucial role in the capital's recovery.

Will Boris Johnson survive June?,"The PM and his wife were at the Platinum Jubilee concert on Saturday evening Boris Johnson's bank holiday weekend hasn't involved much downtime. The prime minister attended a number of events to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee - including the service at St Paul's, where he was booed by part of the crowd. He's also been putting the finishing touches to a major housing policy speech, pencilled in for Thursday, which will see his own answer to help-to-buy as its centrepiece. Mr Johnson wants us all to know he wants to get on with the job. But in between attending jubilee parties, many Tory MPs have been plotting. And within days, some believe the PM will be engaged in a fight to stay in office. All eyes will be on Sir Graham Brady when Parliament returns on Monday. He is the chairman of the 1922 committee - the shop steward for Conservative MPs. If 15% of the party's MPs - 54 of them - write letters or emails to him calling for a confidence vote in the prime minister, it happens. Only Sir Graham knows how many have been sent in so far. That caveat cannot be overstated; nobody knows for sure what will happen over the next few days. But, speaking to Conservative MPs this weekend, many rebels think the threshold will be reached within days. ""The expectation is that it will likely be next week,"" one critic of the prime minister told the BBC. ""Colleagues have to make a decision - finally they will have to make their minds up."" A number of others echoed those sentiments. Within government, some concede a vote could be triggered in the coming days ""by accident"" - not because of well organised rebellion from a section of the party, but because enough disparate groups of MPs are fed up enough to submit a no confidence letter. This video can not be played Watch: There were boos and cheers for the PM as he arrived at the Jubilee thanksgiving service with his wife Carrie Since Parliament broke up for recess on the same day the full Sue Gray report was published, there has been a growing number of MPs who have spoken out to say they think the prime minister should go.The BBC has 28 on the record saying so. Privately there are others who are angry. One MP said: ""I know there are people who have put letters in who haven't said so publicly."" Enough to definitely force a vote this week? ""I don't know,"" they replied. The BBC has spoken to a minister who is among those furious at the situation. Boris Johnson is said to be ""sanguine"" about the prospect of a confidence vote in the near term. And that is because if a vote happens, the bar to remove the prime minister from office is high. It would take a majority of Tory MPs - 180. One of the rebels admitted to the BBC the most likely outcome of a confidence vote this week was a victory for the prime minister - but that Tory MPs couldn't sit on their hands any longer and wait for the next crisis before making a move. How much political danger is Boris Johnson in? Who are the Tory MPs calling on him to go? Sue Gray report: Key findings at a glance Others think if a tipping point isn't reached this week, the best opportunity for rebels could come later this month, after the result of two by-elections triggered by Tory MPs standing down from Parliament. There is a realistic chance the Conservatives will lose both Wakefield (a previous red wall seat that Labour will want to win back) and Tiverton and Honiton (a previous Tory safe seat in Devon, where many believe the Liberal Democrats are on course for another coup). If the prime minister was seen to be losing in both the north and the south of England, it would probably lead to more of his MPs concluding he is no longer an election winner who can keep them in power. One senior MP told the BBC: ""If I was them, I would wait until the by-electionsâ¦ I'd be surprised if it's this week."" There are other reasons why some Tory MPs may hold back this week. Firstly, the prime minister is protected from another confidence vote for a year after winning one. That means Tory MPs wouldn't have another opportunity after the by-elections unless they change the rules. Secondly, the expectation is that the prime minister would stay on even if he won the vote narrowly. As one source close to the PM said this weekend: ""His opponents should not underestimate this man's determination to do what he promised to do."" He is not, they said, going to give up the keys to Downing Street easily. The PM's allies are scathing of those plotting to bring him down. They argue his critics have no alternative plan, no obvious leader and no discernible strategy. ""It's a random bunch of discontented people who don't have a plan but want to blow up the joint"". The government should be focussing, the source argued, on the cost of living crisis, energy policy and the war in Ukraine. ""I can't imagine anything more insane and self-indulgent than deciding a Conservative beauty parade trumps all of that."" But if it happens, we already have a sense of how the prime minister will try to win a confidence vote. Mr Johnson's allies argue he is the only one who can keep together the diverse coalition of voters that won the party a stonking majority at the last election. ""The north of England was voting for Borisâ¦ he is conscious of the support he still has and the massive mandate he won."" Another source added: ""There is no alternative that doesn't blow apart the red wall. It's a huge decision for the party - if you get rid of him, you chuck the progress of the last few years in the bin"". The Lib Dems are hopeful of success in Tiverton and Honiton That is clearly not a view shared by many of his MPs. The prime minister's critics have spent the past week looking at polls - and concluding a change is needed. Among the most despairing are those who have spent time on the doorsteps ahead of the by-election in Tiverton and Honiton. One told the BBC the picture in the constituency was ""appalling"" with some voters saying they wouldn't back the Conservatives again without a change of leader. There is no shortage of nerves among Tory MPs who could face a similar challenge at the next election - there are even some who have concluded they have no chance of winning their seat next time. In the coming days or weeks, they will have a decision to make. Whether to act - or to keep the prime minister in office. Will June be a moment of truth for the Conservative Party - or another damp squib in the long running leadership psychodrama? Many Tory MPs are weighing that up as the bank holiday draws to a close. Who are the Tory MPs that want Johnson out? How much political danger is Boris Johnson in?

Man critical after Taser and fall into Thames,"Police found the man on Chelsea Bridge Road, near the River Thames A man is in a critical condition after being Tasered by police and falling in the River Thames. Police were called to reports of a man armed with a screwdriver and shouting on Chelsea Bridge Road, in Chelsea, just after 09:00 BST on Saturday. Officers challenged a man in his 40s before shooting him with a Taser. He then fell into the river. The man is in a critical condition in hospital and an internal investigation has been launched by the Met Police. A Met spokesman said shooting the man with a Taser ""did not enable the officers to safely detain him"" and he ""subsequently entered the river"". Video shared online shows two officers confronting the man, who falls to the ground after the Taser is discharged. He eventually gets up and runs to the side of the bridge, and is seen to pull himself over the edge before either officer can reach him. The spokesman said: ""A rescue operation was immediately organised. ""The man was rescued from the water by the RNLI and taken to hospital, where his condition has been assessed as critical."" Police are trying to reach the man's family to offer them support from specialist officers. Meanwhile, the force's Directorate of Professional Standards is probing the circumstances and the Met has referred itself to the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC). Det Ch Insp Rory Wilkinson said: ""My thoughts are with this man, who is extremely unwell in hospital. ""Officers are making every effort to make contact with his family. ""I understand that there are always concerns about incidents in which people come to harm having been in contact with police. ""All Met officers know that they are accountable for their actions, and a full investigation is under way to establish exactly what happened."" A spokeswoman for the IOPC confirmed an independent investigation is under way. She said: ""Investigators have been deployed to their post-incident procedure and the scene.""

Yes Queen! Jubilee concert shows love for the royals,"This video can not be played Watch: Queen, Diana Ross, Duran Duran and more perform at the Platinum Party at the Palace At most pop concerts, the audience don't turn their backs on the stage. But this wasn't a normal pop concert, and this wasn't a normal audience. For most of the 22,000 fans attending The Platinum Party at the Palace, the Royal Family were the real stars. Ten minutes before the show started, Prince Charles walked the short distance from Buckingham Palace to the temporary grandstand, waving cheerfully at the crowd as they shouted ""Charles! Charles! Sir! Sir!"" and zoomed their camera phones in to get a better glimpse of the heir to the throne. And while acts like Queen, Elbow and Duran Duran took to the stage, the audience craned their necks to see what was happening in the royal box. Some even brought binoculars. This video can not be played From June 2022: The Queen meets Paddington Bear for Party at the Palace The concert began with a celebration of the Queen's love of humour - as she shared a pot of tea with Paddington Bear in a pre-filmed, heart-warming sketch. Immediately afterwards, Queen (the band) kicked off the music in style, embellishing We Will Rock You with military pomp, courtesy of the Royal Marine Drummers. But many other acts seemed to leave the royal-watchers in the audience mystified. ""I'm not really into gigs,"" admitted one man standing next to me. ""Who's that?"" shouted another when host Lee Mack introduced chart-topping dance act Sigala. Pop royalty and Paddington star at Jubilee concert In pictures: Stars throw party for Jubilee Mummy laughs and cries with us all, says Charles And when Jax Jones took to the stage, were the crowd nodding in time to his slick house-pop, or in acknowledgement of his opening song, You Don't Know Me? More familiar artists fared better. Sir Rod Stewart received a hero's welcome as he ran through Baby Jane; George Ezra's Shotgun triggered an enthusiastic sing-along; and when Mack announced ""please go crazy for Duran Duran"", the crowd duly obliged. Sir Rod Stewart made full use of the four interconnected stages at the front of Buckingham Palace Other highlights included Elbow, who performed One Day Like This with a choir of refugees representing more than 30 countries; and US star Alicia Keys, who retooled her songs of female empowerment as a tribute to the monarch's endurance. As she sang at the piano, the words ""strength"" and ""superwoman"" were projected onto the facade of Buckingham Palace. ""Is this girl on fire?"" asked the singer, introducing a song of the same name, before declaring: ""Yes, Queen!"" - cheekily appropriating a term that originated in black and LGBTQ club cultures in the US. Alicia Keys played a medley of hits including Superwoman, Girl On Fire and Empire State Of Mind Sam Ryder also impressed with a full-throated rendition of his Eurovision smash Space Man, which achieved interstellar orbit via a call-and-response chorus and a squealing guitar solo. Sir Elton John's rendition of Your Song, taped in the red drawing room of Windsor Castle, was genuinely moving. And so, to my surprise, was the moment that drones floating above Buckingham Palace created an image of the Queen's beloved corgis. There were also pre-taped messages from stellar names like Sir Paul McCartney, who said: ""I love you like many other people, so congratulations and thank you for 70 beautiful years""; and Michelle Obama, who thanked the Queen for her ""extraordinary kindness towards our children"". Sam Ryder was dressed for the occasion in a union jack outfit For viewers at home, in particular, it was a slick, encyclopaedic journey through seven decades of rock and pop - with a few gaps (counter-cultural movements like punk and Britpop didn't get a showing). And, as with all events on this scale, there were inevitably some moments that didn't quite work. Diana Ross struggled to find her key as she sang Chain Reaction (viewers at home, apparently spared this moment, complained her microphone was too quiet); and George Ezra seemingly self-censored the lyric ""You better throw a party on the day that I die"", drawing more attention than if he'd left it intact. Diana Ross closed the show with a stunning rendition of Ain't No Mountain High Enough Rod Stewart introduced a rendition of Sweet Caroline - chosen as a tribute to the Queenby the audience of BBC Radio 2- by announcing: ""This isn't a fun one to sing but the BBC made me sing it. Make it fun for me."" The Royal Family did their best, singing along and waving flags in time to the Neil Diamond classic. There were also a couple of references to politics. Standing in front of Buckingham Palace's front gates, Mack joked: ""Finally we can say the words 'party' and 'gate' and it's a positive,"" prompting jeers for Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was in the royal box. Later, Stephen Fry referred to the number of prime ministers the Queen has ""tolerated"" during her seven-decade reign. The Prince of Wales read a touching tribute to his mother Fry also jokingly asked: ""How many concerts of raucously loud music has she had to endure outside her house?"" The Queen watched similar events 10 and 20 years ago, but was unable to attend this concert in person, having already missed the Epsom Derby earlier in the day and a service of Thanksgiving on Friday. Prince Charles did speak on stage, explaining that his mother had missed the show with ""intense regret"". But it is hard to know what she would have made of it all. We do know her favourite songs predate the rock era.A playlist of her top 10, released to mark her 90th birthday in 2016, includes Dame Vera Lynn's White Cliffs of Dover and Fred Astaire's Cheek to Cheek alongside hymns and songs from musical theatre. So she probably would have enjoyed Andrea Bocelli's Nessun Dorma and Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber's medley of theatre hits more than Sigala's Came Here With Love. Pop singer Mabel gave one of the night's most energetic performances But, as Prince Charles pointed out towards the end of the two-and-a-half hour extravaganza, that wasn't necessarily the point. ""The scale of this evening's celebration - and the outpouring of warmth and affection over this whole Jubilee weekend - is our way of saying thank you,"" he said, affectionately addressing the monarch as ""mummy"". He then encouraged the crowd to make a noise loud enough for her to hear in Windsor Castle, 20 miles away. And so the audience turned away from the stage one last time, facing west as they gave the Queen three cheers.

"Mummy laughs and cries with us all, says Charles""Thank you,"" says the Queen's son, in a heartfelt tribute ahead of the final day of celebrations.UK","This video can not be played Watch: 'Mummy, you laugh and cry with us' - Prince Charles The Prince of Wales has paid a heartfelt tribute to his ""mummy"", the Queen, at the Platinum Party at the Palace that drew huge crowds. ""You laugh and cry with us and, most importantly, have been there for us, for these 70 years,"" Charles said. He added serving the public was what ""gets my mother up in the morning"" and thanked her on behalf of the world. The final day of the Jubilee celebrations on Sunday will end with a huge pageant near Buckingham Palace. The Platinum Jubilee Pageant - a carnival procession up The Mall featuring giant puppets and celebrities - will depict key moments from the Queen's seven decades on the throne. Street parties are also set to be held across the UK in what is being called The Big Jubilee Lunch. Key moments from the Jubilee concert In pictures: Stars throw party for Jubilee Yes Queen! Jubilee concert shows love for the Royals Street parties and celebrations in pictures The Queen did not attend Saturday's concert, but she opened the show with a secretly pre-recorded comic sketch featuring Paddington Bear. In it, the two icons shared a chaotic cream tea at Buckingham Palace, with the famous bear gulping down his tea straight from the teapot and accidentally spraying a splodge of cream at the footman. He then revealed that he always carries an emergency stash of his favourite treat: a marmalade sandwich.

Six held in Hong Kong on Tiananmen anniversary,"There was a heavy police presence in Hong Kong on Saturday, with some activists detained by police Six people have been arrested in Hong Kong as authorities moved to restrict public commemoration of the Tiananmen Square massacre. Saturday was the 33rd anniversary of the highly sensitive incident in which China's rulers crushed peaceful protests with tanks and troops. Until recently, Hong Kong was one of the few Chinese territories which commemorated the event. But Beijing has effectively banned the city's annual public vigil. Hong Kong Police confirmed five men and one woman had been arrested in the vicinity of Victoria Park, where a candlelight vigil marking the 1989 crackdown in Beijing would have been held. The six are now in police custody. Some images shared on social media appeared to show people being detained and led away by police officers in the city. Others were seen being searched. Hundreds of police, some with sniffer dogs, were also seen patrolling the area around the park in the evening. Dozens of people - in an apparent attempt to replicate the annual candlelit vigil - turned on their mobile phone torches in an area near to the park on Saturday. They were then warned by police to turn them off, Reuters news agency reports. Officials earlier warned that any unauthorised assembly could see demonstrators facing prison sentences of up to five years. ""For 33 years it has always been peaceful, but today it's like [the police] are facing a big enemy,"" one activist, Chan Po-ying, told AFP. ""The hearts of people will live on."" This video can not be played Tiananmen's tank man: The image that China forgot The Tiananmen Square protests in Beijing became the focus for national demonstrations calling for greater political freedoms in 1989. Thousands of people - mainly students - camped for weeks in the square before the military moved in on 4 June and opened fire. One unidentified protester became an international symbol of protest for blocking an advancing column of tanks in video footage which was seen around the world. The Chinese government says 200 civilians and several dozen security personnel died. Other estimates have ranged from hundreds to as many as 10,000. The actions of the authorities have been seen by activists as part of China's broader agenda to snuff out political dissent in Hong Kong. ON THE GROUND:Students hide tiny Tiananmen 'goddesses' on campus CONTEXT:Hong Kong's year under China's controversial law HISTORY:What happened in the protests of 1989? EXPLAINED:China and Taiwan: A really simple guide China's erasure of public displays of June Fourth - as the Tiananmen anniversary is popularly known in Chinese - has become near-total in Hong Kong since Beijing enacted a national security law on the island in 2020. Self-ruled Taiwan is one of the only parts of the Chinese-speaking world where it can be commemorated openly, and on Saturday hundreds of people gathered in the capital Taipei. Taiwan's President Tsai Ing-wen criticised the ""collective memory of 4 June being systematically erased in Hong Kong"". ""But we believe that such brute force cannot erase people's memories,"" she wrote on social media. ""It's a symbol of how democracy is precious and fragile at the same time, and how people who care about democracy need to stand up,"" Jeremy Chiang, who attended the event in Taipei, told Reuters.

Wales 'knows world against us' in Ukraine play-offUkrainian refugees are invited to the match as Wales face Ukraine for a place in the World Cup.Wales,"This video can not be played DJ Katie Owen, says supporters will be singing their ""hearts out"" on Sunday. Wales' men's football team knows ""most of the world will be against them"" on Sunday as they host Ukraine for a place in the World Cup in Qatar. Wales manager Robert Page said ""most of the world want Ukraine to get through"", in solidarity afterRussia's invasion of Ukrainethat has killed thousands. Ukrainian refugees in the UKhave been offered tickets to the game in Cardiff. Wales hope to put64 years of World Cup hurtbehind them as they bid to qualify for theirfirst finals since 1958. The Football Association of Wales has invited the UK's Ukrainian ambassador to the match, while the Welsh government has given the visiting team and their delegates an official ""warm Welsh welcome"" in support to the people ofUkraine in the war with Russia. Five ways Russiaâs war in Ukraine may play out What does Putin want from Russia's war in Ukraine? In maps: Battles raging in east Ukraine What might swing the Ukraine war? Wales' First Minister Mark Drakeford has sent a message of support to the Welsh team, but added this game was an ""opportunity for us to reaffirm our support for Ukraine as it fights Russia's unprovoked and brutal act of war"". Gareth Bale and Aaron Ramsey will lead Wales' World Cup charge in Sunday's play-off Mr Drakeford went on to say: ""It would be fantastic for the squad and the Welsh supporters to have our team competing in the World Cup in November."" Page, Wales' caretaker boss because of full-time managerRyan Giggs' ongoing absence, has admitted that all the neutral fans will want Ukraine to win. Ukraine fans made their feelings known in Wednesday's play-off semi-final win in Scotland ""Theywon the Eurovision Song Contestbecause they had the backing of the world,"" said Page. ""If we could click our fingers and take away the pain the Ukraine are going through, we'd do it in a heartbeat. But when it comes to football and the whistle goes, we'll want to win that game. Business is business. This video can not be played Wales defender Ben Davies said it can feel ""insensitive"" to play a football game when opponents Ukraine are at war at home ""We've put ourselves in a good position - 1958 is a long time to wait.

Yes Queen! Jubilee concert shows love for the Royals,"This video can not be played Watch: Queen, Diana Ross, Duran Duran and more perform at the Platinum Party at the Palace At most pop concerts, the audience don't turn their backs on the stage. But this wasn't a normal pop concert, and this wasn't a normal audience. For most of the 22,000 fans attending The Platinum Party at the Palace, the Royal Family were the real stars. Ten minutes before the show started, Prince Charles walked the short distance from Buckingham Palace to the temporary grandstand, waving cheerfully at the crowd as they shouted ""Charles! Charles! Sir! Sir!"" and zoomed their camera phones in to get a better glimpse of the heir to the throne. And while acts like Queen, Elbow and Duran Duran took to the stage, the audience craned their necks to see what was happening in the royal box. Some even brought binoculars. This video can not be played From June 2022: The Queen meets Paddington Bear for Party at the Palace The concert began with a celebration of the Queen's love of humour - as she shared a pot of tea with Paddington Bear in a pre-filmed, heart-warming sketch. Immediately afterwards, Queen (the band) kicked off the music in style, embellishing We Will Rock You with military pomp, courtesy of the Royal Marine Drummers. But many other acts seemed to leave the royal-watchers in the audience mystified. ""I'm not really into gigs,"" admitted one man standing next to me. ""Who's that?"" shouted another when host Lee Mack introduced chart-topping dance act Sigala. Pop royalty and Paddington star at Jubilee concert In pictures: Stars throw party for Jubilee Mummy laughs and cries with us all, says Charles And when Jax Jones took to the stage, were the crowd nodding in time to his slick house-pop, or in acknowledgement of his opening song, You Don't Know Me? More familiar artists fared better. Sir Rod Stewart received a hero's welcome as he ran through Baby Jane; George Ezra's Shotgun triggered an enthusiastic sing-along; and when Mack announced ""please go crazy for Duran Duran"", the crowd duly obliged. Sir Rod Stewart made full use of the four interconnected stages at the front of Buckingham Palace Other highlights included Elbow, who performed One Day Like This with a choir of refugees representing more than 30 countries; and US star Alicia Keys, who retooled her songs of female empowerment as a tribute to the monarch's endurance. As she sang at the piano, the words ""strength"" and ""superwoman"" were projected onto the facade of Buckingham Palace. ""Is this girl on fire?"" asked the singer, introducing a song of the same name, before declaring: ""Yes, Queen!"" - cheekily appropriating a term that originated in black and LGBTQ club cultures in the US. Alicia Keys played a medley of hits including Superwoman, Girl On Fire and Empire State Of Mind Sam Ryder also impressed with a full-throated rendition of his Eurovision smash Space Man, which achieved interstellar orbit via a call-and-response chorus and a squealing guitar solo. Sir Elton John's rendition of Your Song, taped in the red drawing room of Windsor Castle, was genuinely moving. And so, to my surprise, was the moment that drones floating above Buckingham Palace created an image of the Queen's beloved corgis. There were also pre-taped messages from stellar names like Sir Paul McCartney, who said: ""I love you like many other people, so congratulations and thank you for 70 beautiful years""; and Michelle Obama, who thanked the Queen for her ""extraordinary kindness towards our children"". Sam Ryder was dressed for the occasion in a union jack outfit For viewers at home, in particular, it was a slick, encyclopaedic journey through seven decades of rock and pop - with a few gaps (counter-cultural movements like punk and Britpop didn't get a showing). And, as with all events on this scale, there were inevitably some moments that didn't quite work. Diana Ross struggled to find her key as she sang Chain Reaction (viewers at home, apparently spared this moment, complained her microphone was too quiet); and George Ezra seemingly self-censored the lyric ""You better throw a party on the day that I die"", drawing more attention than if he'd left it intact. Diana Ross closed the show with a stunning rendition of Ain't No Mountain High Enough Rod Stewart introduced a rendition of Sweet Caroline - chosen as a tribute to the Queenby the audience of BBC Radio 2- by announcing: ""This isn't a fun one to sing but the BBC made me sing it. Make it fun for me."" The Royal Family did their best, singing along and waving flags in time to the Neil Diamond classic. There were also a couple of references to politics. Standing in front of Buckingham Palace's front gates, Mack joked: ""Finally we can say the words 'party' and 'gate' and it's a positive,"" prompting jeers for Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who was in the royal box. Later, Stephen Fry referred to the number of prime ministers the Queen has ""tolerated"" during her seven-decade reign. The Prince of Wales read a touching tribute to his mother Fry also jokingly asked: ""How many concerts of raucously loud music has she had to endure outside her house?"" The Queen watched similar events 10 and 20 years ago, but was unable to attend this concert in person, having already missed the Epsom Derby earlier in the day and a service of Thanksgiving on Friday. Prince Charles did speak on stage, explaining that his mother had missed the show with ""intense regret"". But it is hard to know what she would have made of it all. We do know her favourite songs predate the rock era.A playlist of her top 10, released to mark her 90th birthday in 2016, includes Dame Vera Lynn's White Cliffs of Dover and Fred Astaire's Cheek to Cheek alongside hymns and songs from musical theatre. So she probably would have enjoyed Andrea Bocelli's Nessun Dorma and Sir Andrew Lloyd Webber's medley of theatre hits more than Sigala's Came Here With Love. Pop singer Mabel gave one of the night's most energetic performances But, as Prince Charles pointed out towards the end of the two-and-a-half hour extravaganza, that wasn't necessarily the point. ""The scale of this evening's celebration - and the outpouring of warmth and affection over this whole Jubilee weekend - is our way of saying thank you,"" he said, affectionately addressing the monarch as ""mummy"". He then encouraged the crowd to make a noise loud enough for her to hear in Windsor Castle, 20 miles away. And so the audience turned away from the stage one last time, facing west as they gave the Queen three cheers. Thousands of people crammed into the Mall to watch the show, alongside 22,000 ticketholders who gathered outside the gates of Buckingham Palace Queen We Will Rock You Don't Stop Me Now We Are The Champions Jax Jones You Don't Know Me Instruction (ft Stefflon Don + Nandi Bushell) Don't Call Me Up (ft Mabel) Where Did You Go?
