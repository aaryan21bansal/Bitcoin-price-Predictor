Tunisia bans UAE airline from landing,"The measures against Tunisian women caused widespread anger Tunisia has banned Emirates airline from landing in the capital Tunis after a number of Tunisian women were prevented from boarding its flights. The move comes amid widespread anger in Tunisia, with rights groups condemning ""racist and discriminatory"" measures. The transport ministry said the measure would stay in place until Emirates was able to ""operate flights in accordance with law and international agreements"". The UAE said ""security information"" had caused the delays. ""We contacted our Tunisian brothers about security information that necessitated taking specific procedures,"" Emirati Foreign MinisterAnwar Gargash said on Twitter,externalon Sunday. ""We highly value Tunisian women and respect them,"" he added. Tunisian government officials said the UAE had banned Tunisian women from flying to or transiting through its territory. On Friday the Tunisian government said it had asked the UAE ambassador to clarify what was happening and had been told that the measures had been temporary and had already been lifted. Local media reported that Tunisian women had been blocked from boarding Emirates flights to Dubai over several days. According to AFP news agency, some Tunisian women said their journeys to the UAE had been delayed and some that their visas had to undergo additional examination. Tunisia has been trying to improve relations with the UAE that were damaged by its 2011 revolution. Tunisia's Ennahda party - part of the governing coalition - also has links to Qatar, which has been cut off by the UAE, Saudi Arabia and Bahrain over its alleged support for terrorism.

Trump's Scottish golf resort to lose tax relief,"Donald Trump's Turnberry resort in South Ayrshire is now above the cut-off point for tax relief A Scottish golf resort owned by US President Donald Trump will no longer qualify for a controversial tax break. A change in the Scottish government's recent budget will remove Trump Turnberry in South Ayrshire from a business rates relief scheme. The Sunday Herald revealed,externalthe resort is now above the cut-off point with a rateable value of Â£1,650,000. Scotland's finance secretary Derek Mackay introduced measures in February to help hospitality businesses. The move was in response to growing pressure to intervene to help struggling restaurants and hotels cope with the first revaluation of the rateable value of businesses since 2010. Mr Mackay faced calls to reform the transitional business rates relief scheme afterit emerged in August that Trump Turnberry had benefited by Â£109,530 for 2017/18. In response to a wider review of the business rates system, Mr Mackay announced in September that the transitional scheme would continue next year for ""all but the very largest hospitality properties"". Documents published alongside the draft Scottish budget earlier this month state it will only apply for hospitality properties with a rateable value up to Â£1.5m. According to the Scottish Assessors Association website, Trump Turnberry is now above the cut-off point with a rateable value of Â£1,650,000. Mr Trump bought Turnberry in 2014 but stepped away from the family business empire after being elected US president. His other Scottish golf course, on the Menie estate in Aberdeenshire, did not qualify for relief because it is defined as a golf course rather than a hotel.

Tonioli in tears on Desert Island Discs,"This video can not be played Bruno Tonioli was speaking to Desert Island Discs presenter Kirsty Young Strictly Come Dancing judge Bruno Tonioli has broken down in tears as he recalled losing his mother, as well as friends and relatives, as a young man. Speaking on the Christmas edition of BBC Radio 4'sDesert Island Discs, he dedicated Rod Stewart's version of the Beatles' In My Life to his loved ones. He said: ""They are still part of me... I'm getting emotional"". The star also told how he avoided Italian military service by telling a top official he was gay. Tonioli joined the BBC TV dance contest show when it first aired in 2004 and has become one of its best-known faces. His first break was in theatre with a touring Parisian company and he then went on to work in London in the 1980s as a choreographer for stars including Bananarama, the Rolling Stones and Elton John. His mother died in 1994. He told presenter Kirsty Young that In My Life was ""one of the best poems ever written"" - citing its lyrics ""All these places had their moments/With lovers and friends I still can recall/Some are dead and some are living/In my life I've loved them all."" Tonioli said: ""This song is dedicated to all the people that have passed away.... ""In spite of what has happened in my life, I might have moved away - hopefully I will keep moving - but they are still part of me, they are still... I'm getting emotional."" Strictly Come Dancing 2017: Winner crowned Tonioli said filming Strictly at the same time as the US version of the show, Dancing With The Stars, in Los Angeles, had taken its toll on his health. The schedule forced him tomiss a weekend of this year's Strictly, but he defended himself against reports that the absence was connected to his personal relationship. ""It was a total overlap all the way through,"" Tonioli said. ""I said, 'You have to give me a week off because I don't have time for my body to re-energise,' and it was agreed. I didn't just say I didn't want to do it. I would never do that, I'm a pro."" Tonioli also talked about avoiding military service after telling a top official he was gay, which was not permitted in the Italian armed forces at the time. He said: ""He was actually very nice and said he understood I was not pretending. ""What happened, and I have never told anybody, was that somebody got a whiff and said they would call my parents' house and tell them I'm a queen. So I said, 'Well, do it, who cares?'.""

North Korea: New sanctions an act of war,"This video can not be played North Korea said in November its latest missile was capable of reaching Washington DC North Korea has described the latest UN sanctions imposed on the country as an ""act of war"". A foreign ministry statement said the measures were tantamount to a total economic blockade, the official KCNA news agency reported. It added that strengthening North Korea's deterrence was the only way to frustrate the US. The UN Security Council imposed the new sanctions on Friday in response to Pyongyang's ballistic missile tests. The US-drafted resolution - unanimously backed by all 15 Security Council members - includes measures to slash North Korea's petrol imports by up to 90%. North Korea is already subject to a raft of sanctions from the US, the UN and the EU. North Korea crisis in 300 words Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? Sanctions won't stop us, warns N Korea Characteristically bellicose, it described the latest UN sanctions ""as a violent breach of our republic's sovereignty and an act of war that destroys the peace and stability of the Korean peninsula and a wide region. ""The United States, completely terrified at our accomplishment of the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force, is getting more and more frenzied in the moves to impose the harshest-ever sanctions and pressure on our country. ""We will further consolidate our self-defensive nuclear deterrence aimed at fundamentally eradicating the US nuclear threats, blackmail and hostile moves by establishing the practical balance of force with the US."" This video can not be played How could war with North Korea unfold? This video can not be played The US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, said the new sanctions cut oil and petrol imports The US said it was seeking a diplomatic solution to the issue and drafted this new set of sanctions: Deliveries of petrol products will be capped at 500,000 barrels a year, and crude oil at four million barrels a year All North Korean nationals working abroad will have to return home within 24 months under the proposals, restricting a vital source of foreign currency There will also be a ban on exports of North Korean goods, such as machinery and electrical equipment The UN sanctions came in response toPyongyang's 28 November firing of a ballistic missile, which the US said was its highest yet.

US President Donald Trump has previously threatened to ""totally destroy"" North Korea if it launches a nuclear attack. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has described the US president as ""mentally deranged"". Last month, the US unveiled fresh sanctions against North Koreawhich it said were designed to limit the funding for its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. The measures targeted North Korean shipping operations and Chinese companies that trade with Pyongyang. The UN also approved new sanctions following North Korea's nuclear test on 3 September. These measures restricted oil imports and banned textile exports - an attempt to starve the North of fuel and income for its weapons programmes. The US has been imposing sanctions on North Korea for more than a decade with little success. In fact, North Korea has said fresh sanctions will only make it accelerate its nuclear programme. It has continued to test nuclear and ballistic missiles despite these recent examples of UN pressure: 30 November 2016:UN targeted North Korea's valuable coal trade with China, slashing exports by about 60% under a new sales cap. Exports of copper, nickel, silver, zinc and the sale of statues were also banned What happened next?On 14 May 2017, North Korea tested what it said was a ""newly developed ballistic rocket"" capable of carrying a large nuclear warhead 2 June 2017:UN imposed a travel ban and asset freeze on four entities and 14 officials, including the head of North Korea's overseas spying operations What happened next?On 4 July, North Korea claimed it had carried out its first successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) 6 August 2017:UN banned North Korean exports of coal, ore and other raw materials and limited investments in the country, costing Pyongyang an estimated $1bn - about a third of its export economy What happened next?On 3 September, North Korea said it had tested a hydrogen bomb that could be miniaturised and loaded on a long-range missile.

Putin foe 'nominated to run' in election,"This video can not be played Mr Navalny's supporters gathered in a huge tent on the outskirts of Moscow Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny says he has gathered enough nominations to challenge Vladimir Putin in March's presidential election. His supporters met in 20 cities across the country to secure the signatures. Mr Navalny is still unlikely to run as election officials ruled him ineligible because of a corruption conviction which he says is politically motivated. Mr Navalny spoke at the Moscow gathering, branding Mr Putin a ""bad president"". He told his supporters in a marquee on a snowy riverbank that he would call a boycott of the election if he were not allowed to stand. Mr Navalny is widely regarded as the only candidate with a chance of challenging the president, who is seeking a fourth term that would see him become the longest-serving Russian leader since Joseph Stalin. Russian socialite and TV presenter Ksenia Sobchak is standing in the electionbut some  - including Mr Navalny - regard her as a ""Kremlin stooge"". Alexei Navalny barred from Russia presidential poll Navalny wins European human rights payout Putin to run again for Russian president Profile: Alexei Navalny Separately on Sunday,  an opposition rally called by activist Ilya Yashin was held in the north-west of the capital. Dozens attended the rally, which was streamed live on Facebook by Radio Liberty, chanting ""Russia will be free"" and ""Putin is a thief"". Police declared it ""illegal and provocative"" and vowed to act in ""strict accordance with the law"". However, no-one was detained. By Sarah Rainsford, BBC News, Moscow This meeting in a giant tent on a snowy Moscow riverbank has secured Alexei Navalny well over the 500 signatures he needs to be nominated as candidate. His supporters queued from early morning, cheering and chanting Mr Navalny's name as the finally tally was announced. The anti-corruption campaigner then appeared on stage with his wife and children to a blast of music, giving it all a touch of the American campaign rally.  There was even a burst of red, white and blue confetti. On stage, Alexei Navalny told the crowd that Vladimir Putin does not have the mass support he claims. He insists on the right to run against him, to prove that. His strategy is to try to force the authorities to register him. So if his candidacy is now blocked, despite today's nomination meeting, he's vowed to go on fighting - calling for strikes, an election boycott and street protests. Mr Navalny, 41, needed 500 nominations to secure his nomination. He later tweeted that he had secured the signatures, saying: ""I have become an official candidate nominated by activist groups of voters. Many thanks to those who have taken part in this campaign in all corners of our country. You are the best."" He will hope securing the signatures will pressure the election commission into allowing him to run. The commission's head, Ella Pamfilova, said earlier in the month that because of Mr Navalny's conviction he would be unable to stand and suggested he tried running again in 2028. However, more recently she has said that the commission will examine the candidacy of every presidential hopeful who follows the necessary procedure. Mr Navalny said Mr Putin had during his 18 years in power taken ""from poor people oil, gas and metal worth trillions of dollars, sold it abroad, rewarded those people by turning them from poor to destitute"".

""It is you, Vladimir Putin, who's turned this country into a source of personal enrichment for yourself, your family and your friends. That's why you should no longer be president. You are a bad president."" Mr Putin, who refuses to mention Mr Navalny by name, still retains a massive approval rating and is almost certain to ease to victory in the election.

North Korea: New sanctions an act of warThe country condemns the US-backed United Nations moves against its missile and nuclear programmes.11h11 hours agoAsia,"This video can not be played North Korea said in November its latest missile was capable of reaching Washington DC North Korea has described the latest UN sanctions imposed on the country as an ""act of war"". A foreign ministry statement said the measures were tantamount to a total economic blockade, the official KCNA news agency reported. It added that strengthening North Korea's deterrence was the only way to frustrate the US. The UN Security Council imposed the new sanctions on Friday in response to Pyongyang's ballistic missile tests. The US-drafted resolution - unanimously backed by all 15 Security Council members - includes measures to slash North Korea's petrol imports by up to 90%. North Korea is already subject to a raft of sanctions from the US, the UN and the EU. North Korea crisis in 300 words Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? Sanctions won't stop us, warns N Korea Characteristically bellicose, it described the latest UN sanctions ""as a violent breach of our republic's sovereignty and an act of war that destroys the peace and stability of the Korean peninsula and a wide region. ""The United States, completely terrified at our accomplishment of the great historic cause of completing the state nuclear force, is getting more and more frenzied in the moves to impose the harshest-ever sanctions and pressure on our country. ""We will further consolidate our self-defensive nuclear deterrence aimed at fundamentally eradicating the US nuclear threats, blackmail and hostile moves by establishing the practical balance of force with the US."" This video can not be played How could war with North Korea unfold? This video can not be played The US ambassador to the UN, Nikki Haley, said the new sanctions cut oil and petrol imports The US said it was seeking a diplomatic solution to the issue and drafted this new set of sanctions: Deliveries of petrol products will be capped at 500,000 barrels a year, and crude oil at four million barrels a year All North Korean nationals working abroad will have to return home within 24 months under the proposals, restricting a vital source of foreign currency There will also be a ban on exports of North Korean goods, such as machinery and electrical equipment The UN sanctions came in response toPyongyang's 28 November firing of a ballistic missile, which the US said was its highest yet.

US President Donald Trump has previously threatened to ""totally destroy"" North Korea if it launches a nuclear attack. North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has described the US president as ""mentally deranged"". Last month, the US unveiled fresh sanctions against North Koreawhich it said were designed to limit the funding for its nuclear and ballistic missile programmes. The measures targeted North Korean shipping operations and Chinese companies that trade with Pyongyang. The UN also approved new sanctions following North Korea's nuclear test on 3 September. These measures restricted oil imports and banned textile exports - an attempt to starve the North of fuel and income for its weapons programmes. The US has been imposing sanctions on North Korea for more than a decade with little success. In fact, North Korea has said fresh sanctions will only make it accelerate its nuclear programme. It has continued to test nuclear and ballistic missiles despite these recent examples of UN pressure: 30 November 2016:UN targeted North Korea's valuable coal trade with China, slashing exports by about 60% under a new sales cap. Exports of copper, nickel, silver, zinc and the sale of statues were also banned What happened next?On 14 May 2017, North Korea tested what it said was a ""newly developed ballistic rocket"" capable of carrying a large nuclear warhead 2 June 2017:UN imposed a travel ban and asset freeze on four entities and 14 officials, including the head of North Korea's overseas spying operations What happened next?On 4 July, North Korea claimed it had carried out its first successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) 6 August 2017:UN banned North Korean exports of coal, ore and other raw materials and limited investments in the country, costing Pyongyang an estimated $1bn - about a third of its export economy What happened next?On 3 September, North Korea said it had tested a hydrogen bomb that could be miniaturised and loaded on a long-range missile.

"Defence secretary halts Army 'rebrand'The 'Be the Best' slogan and crest depicting crossed swords, a crown and a lion, will stay.5h5 hours agoUK","Plans to ditch the Army's Be the Best slogan and its crest logo have been halted by the defence secretary. The Mail on Sunday,externalsaid the Army was considering changing the slogan after market research said it was considered ""dated, elitist and non-inclusive"". The Ministry of Defence said the Army-commissioned rebrand had cost Â£520,000. But a spokesman told BBC News that Gavin Williamson believed the Army was ""the best of the best"" and that the rebrand proposals had been put on hold. Is the UK spending 2% of GDP on defence? 'Serious doubts' over defence savings Warning of Tory revolt over military cuts According to the newspaper, a leaked document from the department - written by the Army's most senior officer, General Sir Nick Carter - said market research carried out by the MoD showed the slogan ""did not resonate with many of our key audiences"". As a result, the Army's executive committee agreed ""its use should be phased out as soon as affordably possible"", with plans for the ""retirement of Be the Best [to] commence immediately"". The research also found the Army's crest - depicting crossed swords, a crown and a lion - to be ""non-inclusive"" and recommended replacing both with a union jack with the word ARMY in bold underneath. It is not clear when Mr Williamson became aware of the plans, but he has since put them on hold. Chairman of the Commons Defence Select Committee, Julian Lewis, told the newspaper that being the best was ""nothing to be ashamed of"". He said: ""It is a matter for pride and a very positive message to transmit. Why should we be afraid of excellence when we are constantly saying our Armed Forces are the best in the world?"" Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood has tweeted that ""whatever the strapline"" the force is ""the most professional Army in the world"", adding: ""That makes them the best"". Colonel Richard Kemp, the former commander of UK troops in Afghanistan, added that it was ""lunacy to squander money on a futile branding project"" when there was already pressure on the defence budget. In 2016, the government pledged tospend Â£178bn on new military equipmentover the next 10 years. However, it can only do so if the department can find Â£7.3bn of efficiency savings - on top of Â£7.1bn previously announced - by selling off property and making other efficiencies. Mr Williamson has also beenwarned of a Tory revoltif any cuts to Army and Navy numbers are announced as part of an ongoing security review.

The hidden cost of the processed food revolutionHow a razor revolutionised the way we pay for stuffWhy did we use leaded petrol for so long?How the smartphone became so smartHow the humble S-bend made modern toilets possible,"It is a typical November Tuesday for Mary, who lives in the north-east of the United States. She is 44, has a degree, and her family is prosperous - in the top quarter of American households by income. So what has she done today? Is she a lawyer or a teacher? No. Mary spent an hour knitting and sewing, two hours setting the table and doing the dishes and well over two hours preparing and cooking food. She is not unusual, because it is 1965 and at that time, many married American women - even those with an excellent education - spent large chunks of their day catering for their families. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world in which we live. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. We know about Mary's day - and those of many others - because of time-use surveys conducted around the world. These diaries reveal precisely how different people use their time. For educated women, the way time is spent in the US and other rich countries has changed radically over the past half a century. Women in America now spend around 45 minutes per day in total cooking and cleaning up. That's still much more than men, who spend only 15 minutes a day doing such tasks. But it is a vast reduction from Mary's four hours. Behind this shift is a radical change to the way the food we eat is prepared, as seen by the introduction of the TV dinner in 1954. Presented in a space-age aluminium tray, and prepared so that everything would require the same cooking time, the ""frozen turkey tray TV dinner"" was developed by a bacteriologist called Betty Cronin. She worked for the Swanson food processing company, keen to find ways to keep busy after the business of supplying rations to US troops had dried up. But of course the TV dinner was only part of a panoply of changes, wrought by the availability of freezers, microwaves, preservatives and production lines. Food had been perhaps the last cottage industry: something that would overwhelmingly be produced in the home. But food preparation has been industrialised - outsourced to restaurants and takeaways and to factories that prepare ready-to-eat or ready-to-cook meals. And the invention of the industrial meal - in all its forms - has led to a profound shift in the modern economy. How we spend on food is changing. In 2015, US consumers spent more money on food and drink outside their home than on groceries for the first time American families spend increasingly more outside the home - on fast food, restaurant meals, sandwiches and snacks. Only a quarter of food spending was outside the home in the 1960s. That has steadily risen over time and in 2015 a landmark was reached: for the first time, Americans spent more on food and drink outside the home than at grocery stores. The British passed that particular milestone more than a decade earlier. Even within the home, food is increasingly processed to save the chef time and effort: bagged chopped salad, pre-grated cheese, jars of pasta sauce, individual permeable tea bags, meatballs doused in sauce and chicken that comes plucked and gutted. Each new innovation would seem bizarre to the older generation. I have never plucked a chicken and perhaps my children will never chop salad. All this saves time - serious amounts of time. Such innovation is a modern phenomenon. When the economist Valerie Ramey compared time-use diaries in the US between the 1920s and the 1960s, she found that surprisingly little had changed. Whether women were uneducated and married to farmers, or highly educated and married to urban professionals, they still spent similar amounts of time on housework across those 50 years. It was only in the 1960s that this pattern began to shift. But surely the innovation responsible for emancipating women was not the TV dinner, but the washing machine? The idea is widely believed and is appealing. A frozen TV dinner does not really feel like progress, compared to home-cooked food. The washing machine was innovative, but did not save much time But a washing machine is clean and efficient and replaces work that was always drudgery. How could it not have been revolutionary? Well it was, of course. However, the revolution wasn't in the lives of women, it was in how lemon fresh we all started to smell. As Alison Wolf argues in her book The XX Factor, the evidence is clear that the washing machine did not save a lot of time, because before washing machines, we did not wash clothes very often. When it took all day to wash and dry a few shirts, people used replaceable collars and cuffs or dark outer layers to hide the grime. In contrast, when it took two or three hours to prepare a meal, someone had to take that time. There was not an alternative. The washing machine did not save much time, and the ready meal did, because we were not willing to starve, but we were willing to stink. Tick tock: The importance of knowing the right time How a razor revolutionised the way we pay for stuff Rise of the robots: What advances mean for workers Geeks v government: The battle to secure the internet The availability of ready meals has had some regrettable side-effects. Obesity rates rose sharply in developed countries between the 1970s and the early 21st Century, at much the same time as these culinary innovations were being developed. This is no coincidence, say health economists. The cost of calories has fallen dramatically, not just in financial terms but also in terms of time. Consider the humble potato. It has long been a staple of the American diet, but before World War Two potatoes were usually baked, mashed or boiled. There's a reason for that: roast potatoes need to be peeled, chopped, par-boiled and then roasted. French fries or chips must be finely chopped and then deep fried. Over time, however, the production of fried sliced potato chips - both French fries and crisps - was centralised. French fries can be peeled, chopped, fried and frozen in a factory and then refried in a fast-food restaurant or microwaved at home. Obesity rates have risen sharply since the large scale industrialisation of food production Between 1977 and 1995, American potato consumption increased by a third, almost entirely because of the rise of fried potatoes. Even simpler, crisps can be fried, salted, flavoured and packaged to last for many weeks on the shelf. But this convenience comes at a cost. In the US, calorie intake by adults rose by about 10% between the 1970s and the 1990s. Not as a result of more calorific regular meals but because of increased snacking - usually of processed convenience food. Psychology - and common sense - suggest this should not be a surprise. Experiments by behavioural scientists show that we make very different decisions about what to eat depending on how far away the meal is. A long-planned meal is likely to be nutritious, but when we make more impulsive decisions, our snacks are more likely to be junk food than something nourishing. The industrialisation of food - symbolised by the TV dinner - changed our economy in two important ways. It freed women from hours of domestic chores, removing a large obstacle to them adopting serious professional careers. But by making empty calories ever more convenient to acquire, it also freed our waistlines to expand. The challenge now - as with so many inventions - is to enjoy the benefit without also suffering the cost.

How a razor revolutionised the way we pay for stuffWhy did we use leaded petrol for so long?How the smartphone became so smartHow the humble S-bend made modern toilets possible,"The man who founded the Gillette corporation, King Camp Gillette, had some surprising philosophical ideas. In 1894, Gillette published a book arguing that ""our present system of competition"" breeds ""extravagance, poverty, and crime"". He advocated a new system of ""equality, virtue, and happiness"", in which just one corporation - the United Company - would make all of life's necessities, as cost-effectively as possible. Gillette's book called for everyone in North America to live in a single city, called Metropolis. He imagined ""mammoth apartment housesâ¦ upon a scale of magnificence such as no civilization has ever known"", connected by artificial parks with ""domes of coloured glass in beautiful designs"". It would be, he said, ""an endless gallery of loveliness"". His idea didn't take off. But a year later, in 1895, King Camp Gillette had another brainwave that really did change the world. He invented the disposable razor blade. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations that helped create the economic world. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. It revolutionised more than shaving. Gillette's blade led to a business model that has become ubiquitous in the modern economy. That model is called two-part pricing. If you have ever bought replacement cartridges for an inkjet printer, you may well have been annoyed to discover they cost almost as much as you paid for the printer itself. That seems to make no sense. The printer is a reasonably large and complicated piece of technology. How can it possibly add only a negligible amount to the cost of supplying a bit of ink in tiny plastic pots? The answer, of course, is that it doesn't. But for a manufacturer, selling the printer cheaply and the ink expensively is a business model that makes sense. After all, what's the alternative? Buy a whole new printer from a rival manufacturer? As long as that is even slightly more expensive than the new ink for your current printer, you will reluctantly pay up. King Camp Gillette realised he could charge people a premium for the blades for his razor Two-part pricing is also known as the ""razor and blades"" model, because that's where it first drew attention - draw people in with an attractively priced razor, then repeatedly charge them for expensive replacement blades. Before King Camp Gillette, razors were bigger, chunkier affairs - and a significant enough expense that when the blade got dull, you would sharpen - or ""strop"" - it, not chuck it away and buy another. Gillette realised that if he devised a clever holder for the blade, to keep it rigid, he could make the blade much thinner - and hence much cheaper to produce. He did not immediately hit upon the two-part pricing model, though. Initially, he made both parts expensive. Gillette's razor cost $5 (Â£4) - about a third of the average worker's weekly wage. The Gillette razor was so eye-wateringly exorbitant that the 1913 Sears catalogue offered it with an apology that it was not legally allowed to discount the price. It also included an annoyed-sounding disclaimer: ""Gillette safety razors are quoted for the accommodation of some of our customers who want this particular razor. We don't claim that this razor will give better satisfaction than the lower-priced safety razors quoted on this page."" The model of cheap razors and expensive blades evolved only later, as Gillette's patents expired and competitors got in on the act. Nowadays, two-part pricing is everywhere. Consider the PlayStation 4. The Sony PlayStation 4, which went on sale in November 2013, has surpassed 40 million sales worldwide Every time Sony sells one, it loses money: the retail price is less than it costs to manufacture and distribute. But that is OK, because Sony makes its money whenever a PlayStation 4 owner buys a game. Or how about Nespresso? Nestle profits not from selling the machine, but the coffee pods. Obviously, for this model to work you need some way to prevent customers putting cheap, generic blades in your razor. One solution is legal: patent-protect your blades. But patents don't last forever. Patents on coffee pods have started expiring, so brands such as Nespresso now face competitors selling cheap, compatible alternatives. Some are looking for another kind of solution: technological. Just as other people's games don't work on the PlayStation, and non-branded print cartridges may not work in some printers, coffee companies have put chip readers in their machines to stop you sneakily trying to brew up a generic cup. Nespresso makes more money from selling its coffee pods than the coffee machines Two-part pricing models work by imposing what economists call ""switching costs"". Want to brew another brand's coffee? Then buy another machine. They are especially prevalent with digital goods. If you have a huge library of games for your PlayStation, or books for your Kindle, it is a big thing to switch to another platform. Switching costs don't have to be financial. They can come in the form of time, or hassle. If I am already familiar with Adobe's Photoshop software, I might prefer to pay for an expensive upgrade rather than buy a cheaper alternative, which I would then have to learn how to use. That is why software vendors offer free trials, and why banks and utilities offer special ""teaser"" rates to draw people in. When they quietly raise the price, many will not bother to change. Switching costs can be psychological, too - a result of brand loyalty. If Gillette's marketing department persuades me that generic blades give an inferior shave, then I will happily keep paying extra for Gillette-branded blades. That may explain the otherwise curious fact that Gillette's profits increased after his patents expired and competitors could make compatible blades. How Ikea's Billy took over the world How economics killed the antibiotic dream How the invention of paper changed the world What makes gambling wrong but insurance right? Perhaps, by then, customers had got used to thinking of Gillette as a high-end brand, worth paying a premium for. Two-part pricing can be highly inefficient, and economists have puzzled over why consumers stand for it. The most plausible explanation is that they get confused. Either they don't realise they will be exploited later, or they do realise but find it hard to think ahead and pick out the best deal. The irony is that the razors-and-blades model - charging customers a premium for basics such as ink and coffee - is about as far as you can get from King Camp Gillette's vision of a single United Company producing life's necessities as cheaply as possible. Evidently, it's easier to inspire a new model for business than a new model for society.

Why did we use leaded petrol for so long?How the smartphone became so smartHow the humble S-bend made modern toilets possible,"Chemist Thomas Midgley insisted that tetraethyl lead was safe Leaded petrol was safe. Its inventor was sure of it. Facing sceptical reporters at a press conference in October 1924, Thomas Midgley dramatically produced a container of tetraethyl lead - the additive in question - and washed his hands in it. ""I'm not taking any chance whatever,"" Midgley declared. ""Nor would I... doing that every day."" Midgley was - perhaps - being a little disingenuous. He had recently spent several months in Florida, recuperating from lead poisoning. Some of those who'd made Midgley's invention hadn't been so lucky, which is why reporters were interested. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world in which we live. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. On the Thursday of the week before Midgley's press conference, at a Standard Oil plant in New Jersey, a worker named Ernest Oelgert started hallucinating. By Friday, he was running around the laboratory, screaming in terror. On Saturday, with Oelgert dangerously unhinged, his sister called the police. He was taken to hospital and forcibly restrained. By Sunday, he was dead. Within the week, so were four of his colleagues - and 35 more were in hospital. Only 49 people worked there. None of this surprised workers elsewhere in Standard Oil's facility. They knew there was a problem with tetraethyl lead. As Gerald Markowitz and David Rosner note in their book Deceit and Denial: The Deadly Politics of Industrial Pollution, the lab where it was developed was known as ""the loony gas building"". Nor should it have shocked Standard Oil, General Motors or the DuPont Corporation, the three companies involved with adding tetraethyl lead to gasoline. An aerial photograph of DuPont's Deepwater factory site, where tetraethyl lead was developed The first production line in Ohio had already been shut down after two deaths. A third plant elsewhere in New Jersey had also seen fatalities. Workers kept hallucinating insects - the lab was known as ""the house of butterflies"". Better working practices could make tetraethyl lead safe to produce. But was it really sensible to add it to petrol, when the fumes would be belched out on to city streets? About a century ago, when General Motors had first proposed adding lead to petrol - in order to improve performance - scientists were alarmed. They urged the government to investigate the public health implications. Midgley breezily assured the surgeon general that ""the average street will probably be so free from lead that it will be impossible to detect it or its absorption"", although he conceded that ""no actual experimental data has been taken"". Chemist Thomas Midgley with the Delco laboratory test engine General Motors funded a government bureau to conduct some research, adding a clause saying it had to approve the findings. The bureau's report was published amid the media frenzy over Oelgert's poisoned workmates. It gave tetraethyl lead a clean bill of health and was met with some scepticism. Under pressure, the government organised a conference in Washington DC in May 1925. The debate there exemplified the two extremes of approach to any new idea that looks risky, but useful. In one corner: Frank Howard, vice-president of the Ethyl Corporation - a joint venture between General Motors and Standard Oil. He called leaded petrol a ""gift of God"", arguing that ""continued development of motor fuels is essential in our civilization"". Dr Alice Hamilton argued the benefits of adding lead to petrol were outweighed by the risks In the other corner: Dr Alice Hamilton, the country's foremost authority on lead. She argued leaded petrol was a chance not worth taking. ""Where there is lead,"" she said, ""some case of lead poisoning sooner or later develops, even under the strictest supervision."" Hamilton knew that lead had been poisoning people for thousands of years. In 1678, workers who made lead white - a pigment for paint - were described as suffering ailments including ""dizziness in the head, with continuous great pain in the brows, blindness, stupidity"". The Romans used lead in water pipes. Lead miners often ended up mad or dead - and some correctly intuited that low-level, long-term exposure was also unwise. ""Water conducted through earthen pipes is more wholesome than that through lead,"" wrote the civil engineer Vitruvius, 2,000 years ago. ""This may be verified by observing the workers in lead, who are of a pallid colour."" Many societies still grapple with the general question on which Howard and Hamilton disagreed: how much pollution is a price worth paying for progress? There's some evidence that as countries get richer, they tend initially to get dirtier and later clean up. Economists call this the ""environmental Kuznets curve"", and it makes intuitive sense. If you're poor, you prioritise material gains. As your income grows, you may choose to spend some of it on a nicer, safer environment. The Roman civil engineer Vitruvius warned against the dangers of lead 2,000 years ago But was lead-free petrol really such an expensive luxury? True, the lead additive solved a problem: it enabled engines to use higher compression ratios, which made cars more powerful. However, it was not the only way to solve the problem. Ethyl alcohol had much the same effect and wouldn't mess with your head, unless you drank it. Midgley knew this, having combined petrol with practically every imaginable substance, from iodine to camphor to melted butter. Why did the petrol companies push tetraethyl lead instead of ethyl alcohol? Researchers who have studied the decision remain puzzled. Cynics might point out that any old farmer could distil ethyl alcohol from grain. It couldn't be patented, or its distribution profitably controlled. Tetraethyl lead could. The US didn't tax lead in petrol until the 1970s, then finally banned it as part of clean air legislation, as the country moved down the far side of the environmental Kuznets curve. Two decades later, in the 1990s, rates of violent crime started to go down. There are many reasons why this might have happened, but the economist Jessica Reyes had an intriguing thought. Children's brains are especially susceptible to chronic lead poisoning. Is it possible that kids who didn't breathe leaded petrol fumes grew up to commit less violent crime? Reyes could test her hypothesis: different US states phased out leaded petrol at different times. By comparing the dates of clean air legislation with subsequent crime data,she concluded that more than half the drop - 56% - was because of cars switching to unleaded petrol.,external Other researchers have foundsimilar links between lead water pipes and urban homicide.,external You can put a dollar figure on the value of crime reduction, Reyes found. It's about 20 times higher than the cost of de-leading petrol - and that's before you count other downsides of children breathing lead, like worse performance in school. How did the US get this so wrong for so long? Asbestos continued to be widely used in construction despite the emerging evidence of its dangers It's a tale of disputed science and delayed regulation, much like you could tell about asbestos, or tobacco, or other products we now know slowly kill us. The problem is that people who want to ban things aren't always disinterested visionaries like Hamilton. Sometimes they're obstructive cranks. The only way to tell the difference is by conducting studies. And, as Gerald Markowitz and David Rosner point out, ""For the next four decades, all studies of the use of tetraethyl lead were conducted by laboratories and scientists funded by the Ethyl Corporation and General Motors"". How Diesel's engine changed the world Battery bonanza: From frogs' legs to mobiles and electric cars Why the falling cost of light matters How a razor revolutionised the way we pay for stuff And what of the scientist who first put lead in petrol? By all accounts, Midgley was a genial man who may even have believed his own spin about the safety of a daily tetraethyl lead handwash. But, as an inventor, his inspirations seem to have been cursed. His second major contribution to civilisation was the chlorofluorocarbon, or CFC, which improved refrigerators, but destroyed the ozone layer. In middle age, afflicted by polio, Midgley applied his inventor's mind to lifting his weakened body out of bed. He devised an ingenious system of pulleys and strings. They tangled around his neck, and killed him. Tim Harford writes the Financial Times's Undercover Economist column.50 Things That Made the Modern Economyis broadcast on the BBC World Service.

How the smartphone became so smartHow the humble S-bend made modern toilets possible,"On 9 January 2007, one of the most influential entrepreneurs on the planet announced something new - a product that was to become the most profitable in history. It was, of course, the iPhone. There are many ways in which the iPhone has defined the modern economy. There is the sheer profitability of the thing, of course: there are only two or three companies in the world that make as much money as Apple does from the iPhone alone. Apple may not have sold the first smartphone, but the iPhone represented a quantum leap compared with earlier models, and its version became an object of desire for most of humanity. There's the way the iPhone transformed other markets - software, music, and advertising. But those are just the obvious facts about the iPhone. And when you delve more deeply, the tale is a surprising one. We give credit to Steve Jobs and other leading figures in Apple - his early partner Steve Wozniak, his successor Tim Cook, his visionary designer Sir Jony Ive - but some of the most important actors in this story have been forgotten. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world we live in. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can find more information about the programme's sources andlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. Ask yourself: what actually makes an iPhone an iPhone? It's partly the cool design, the user interface, the attention to detail in the way the software works and the hardware feels. But underneath the charming surface of the iPhone are some critical elements that made it, and all the other smartphones, possible. The economist Mariana Mazzucato has made a list of 12 key technologies that make smartphones work: 1) tiny microprocessors, 2) memory chips, 3) solid state hard drives, 4) liquid crystal displays and 5) lithium-based batteries. That's the hardware. Then there are the networks and the software. So 6) Fast-Fourier-Transform algorithms - clever bits of maths that make it possible to swiftly turn analogue signals such as sound, visible light and radio waves into digital signals that a computer can handle. At 7) - and you might have heard of this one - the internet. A smartphone isn't a smartphone without the internet. At 8) HTTP and HTML, the languages and protocols that turned the hard-to-use internet into the easy-to-access World Wide Web. 9) Cellular networks. Otherwise your smartphone not only isn't smart, it's not even a phone. 10) Global Positioning Systems or GPS. 11) The touchscreen. 12) Siri, the voice-activated artificial intelligence agent. Apple's designer Sir Jony Ive has been widely lauded for his contribution to the iPhone's success All of these technologies are important components of what makes an iPhone, or any smartphone, actually work. Some of them are not just important, but indispensable. But when Mariana Mazzucato assembled this list of technologies, and reviewed their history, she found something striking. The foundational figure in the development of the iPhone wasn't Steve Jobs. It was Uncle Sam. Every single one of these 12 key technologies was supported in significant ways by governments - often the American government. A few of these cases are famous. Many people know, for example, that the World Wide Web owes its existence to the work of Sir Tim Berners-Lee. He was a software engineer employed at Cern, the particle physics research centre in Geneva that is funded by governments across Europe. And the internet itself started as Arpanet - an unprecedented network of computers funded by the US Department of Defense in the early 1960s. GPS, of course, was a pure military technology, developed during the Cold War and opened up to civilian use only in the 1980s. Other examples are less famous, though scarcely less important. Smartphones have all benefited from government investment in technology The Fast-Fourier-Transform is a family of algorithms that have made it possible to move from a world where the telephone, the television and the gramophone worked on analogue signals, to a world where everything is digitised and can therefore be dealt with by computers such as the iPhone. The most common such algorithm was developed from a flash of insight from the great American mathematician John Tukey. What was Tukey working on at the time? You've guessed it: a military application. Specifically, he was on President Kennedy's Scientific Advisory committee in 1963, trying to figure out how to detect when the Soviet Union was testing nuclear weapons. Smartphones wouldn't be smartphones without their touchscreens - but the inventor of the touchscreen was an engineer named EA Johnson, whose initial research was carried out while Johnson was employed by the Royal Signals and Radar Establishment, a stuffily-named agency of the British government. The work was further developed at Cern - those guys again. Eventually multi-touch technology was commercialised by researchers at the University of Delaware in the United States - Wayne Westerman and John Elias, who sold their company to Apple itself. Touchscreen technology has gone on to drive the development of tablet computers Yet even at that late stage in the game, governments played their part: Wayne Westerman's research fellowship was funded by the US National Science Foundation and the CIA. Then there's the girl with the silicon voice, Siri. Back in the year 2000, seven years before the first iPhone, the US Defence Advanced Research Projects Agency, Darpa, commissioned the Stanford Research Institute to develop a kind of proto-Siri, a virtual office assistant that might help military personnel to do their jobs. Twenty universities were brought into the project, furiously working on all the different technologies necessary to make a voice-activated virtual assistant a reality. Seven years later, the research was commercialised as a start-up, Siri Incorporated- and it was only in 2010 that Apple stepped in to acquire the results for an undisclosed sum. Increasingly sophisticated lithium-ion batteries have been essential for smartphone growth As for hard drives, lithium-ion batteries, liquid crystal displays and semiconductors themselves - there are similar stories to be told. In each case, there was scientific brilliance and plenty of private sector entrepreneurship. But there were also wads of cash thrown at the problem by government agencies - usually US government agencies, and for that matter, usually some arm of the US military. Silicon Valley itself owes a great debt to Fairchild Semiconductor - the company that developed the first commercially practical integrated circuits. And Fairchild Semiconductor, in its early days, depended on military procurement. Of course, the US military didn't make the iPhone. Cern did not create Facebook or Google. These technologies, that so many people rely on today, were honed and commercialised by the private sector. But it was government funding and government risk-taking that made all these things possible. That's a thought to hold on to as we ponder the technological challenges ahead in fields such energy and biotechnology. Steve Jobs was a genius, there's no denying that. One of his remarkable side projects was the animation studio Pixar - which changed the world of film when it released the digitally animated film, Toy Story. Even without the touchscreen and the internet and the Fast-Fourier-Transform, Steve Jobs might well have created something wonderful. But it would not have been a world-shaking technology like the iPhone. More likely it would, like Woody and Buzz, have been an utterly charming toy.

Hope for jailed mum release 'within days',"Nazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, the British-Iranian mother who has been held in Iran for 20 months, could be freed within a fortnight, her husband says. Richard Ratcliffe told BBC Radio 4's Broadcasting House programme that the ""best case"" was a 25 December release. ""We are sitting by the phone hoping"", he said, days after an Iranian database listed her as eligible for release. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who turns 39 on Boxing Day, is being held in Iran on spying charges - which she denies. Her lawyer had visited her in prison, Mr Ratcliffe said, and expected her to be released within the next two weeks. Prisoner caught in Iran power struggle Health check for mother jailed in Iran ""She's still in prison today, so best case is tomorrow,"" he said. ""It's her birthday on Boxing Day so we were sort of hoping she'd be out for then"". The charity worker travelled to Iran last year with her daughter Gabriella, but maintains she was on holiday there. Mr Ratcliffe initiallyhoped for his wife's return to the UK before Christmas, after learning of a status change in her case from ""closed"" to ""eligible for release"". He said ""there's no sign of a new court case"" and that he was ""sitting by the phone hoping"". But Iran's spokesman for the judiciary, Gholam-Hossein Mohseni-Eje'i, refused to rule out a second charge for ""spreading propaganda"". Speaking on Sunday, he said Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, who is serving a five-year prison sentence for alleged spying, had only received a final verdict on this charge. Mrs Zaghari-Ratcliffe, 38, has dual British and Iranian citizenship. On 3 April 2016, she was arrested at an Iranian airport while travelling home with her young daughter and accused of plotting against the Iranian government. She says she took her daughter Gabriella, three, to Iran to celebrate the country's new year and visit her parents. Before her arrest, she lived in London with accountant husband Richard Ratcliffe and worked as a project manager for the charity Thomson Reuters Foundation. Read more about the Iran jail case Mr Ratcliffe said he would light the candles on a birthday cake for his wife whatever happens, and telephone three-year-old Gabriella who is being looked after by her grandparents in Iran. ""She quite likes to watch a birthday cake having its candles blown out,"" he said. ""[We] sort of try and defiantly celebrate if we can, and keep spirits up."" This video can not be played Richard Ratcliffe tells the BBC: ""Formally, on the system, she's eligible to be released at any point."" Mr Ratcliffe said his wife's prospects had improved since her case was taken up by Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson - after he apologised for agaffe which appeared to contradict claims she was on holiday. He admitted to being ""critical"" of Mr Johnson, but said: ""He's been making every effort in the past couple of weeks and his visit to Iran was profoundly important."" He admitted the progress of his wife's case in Iran was ""bewildering"", adding: ""We're trying not to get too up or too down and just keep battling on"".

Defence secretary halts Army 'rebrand',"Plans to ditch the Army's Be the Best slogan and its crest logo have been halted by the defence secretary. The Mail on Sunday,externalsaid the Army was considering changing the slogan after market research said it was considered ""dated, elitist and non-inclusive"". The Ministry of Defence said the Army-commissioned rebrand had cost Â£520,000. But a spokesman told BBC News that Gavin Williamson believed the Army was ""the best of the best"" and that the rebrand proposals had been put on hold. Is the UK spending 2% of GDP on defence? 'Serious doubts' over defence savings Warning of Tory revolt over military cuts According to the newspaper, a leaked document from the department - written by the Army's most senior officer, General Sir Nick Carter - said market research carried out by the MoD showed the slogan ""did not resonate with many of our key audiences"". As a result, the Army's executive committee agreed ""its use should be phased out as soon as affordably possible"", with plans for the ""retirement of Be the Best [to] commence immediately"". The research also found the Army's crest - depicting crossed swords, a crown and a lion - to be ""non-inclusive"" and recommended replacing both with a union jack with the word ARMY in bold underneath. It is not clear when Mr Williamson became aware of the plans, but he has since put them on hold. Chairman of the Commons Defence Select Committee, Julian Lewis, told the newspaper that being the best was ""nothing to be ashamed of"". He said: ""It is a matter for pride and a very positive message to transmit. Why should we be afraid of excellence when we are constantly saying our Armed Forces are the best in the world?"" Defence Minister Tobias Ellwood has tweeted that ""whatever the strapline"" the force is ""the most professional Army in the world"", adding: ""That makes them the best"". Colonel Richard Kemp, the former commander of UK troops in Afghanistan, added that it was ""lunacy to squander money on a futile branding project"" when there was already pressure on the defence budget. In 2016, the government pledged tospend Â£178bn on new military equipmentover the next 10 years. However, it can only do so if the department can find Â£7.3bn of efficiency savings - on top of Â£7.1bn previously announced - by selling off property and making other efficiencies.

Fishery's 'no Polish' sign taken down,"This video can not be played Polish fisherman Rado Papiewski wants to have the sign removed The owner of a fishery which displayed a sign banning Polish and ""Eastern bloc"" anglers says it has been taken down after his family received threats. Billy Evans of Field Farm Fisheries said the sign went up because he had caught anglers stealing fish. He said he now may also shut the fishery. Polish fisherman Rado Papiewski raised more than Â£10,000 for a private prosecution to have the sign removed. The Equality and Human Rights Commission says the sign was unlawful. It had warned it would take ""enforcement action"" if necessary. Mr Evans told the BBC: ""The sign has been removed because of threats to my family. ""I am not in the country. I will decide what to do on my return. I may close it to all public long term."" Mr Evans said the fishery, in Launton, near Bicester, Oxfordshire, was closed as usual for the winter but would remain so until further notice. He added: ""I do not tolerate thieves, wherever they come from."" Billy Evans (pictured in 2009) said there had been threats to his family Mr Papiewski, from Doncaster, South Yorkshire, runs a project calledBuilding Bridges,,externalfor the Angling Trust, which aims to ""educate and integrate"" anglers from other countries. The project website explains that anglers from countries such as Poland have traditionally caught fish ""for the pot"", whereas in Britain anglers generally return fish to the water. He believes the sign was is in breach of the Equality Act 2010. Writing on his crowdfunding page on Thursday, he called its removal a ""big step in the right direction and we are now seeking written confirmation that they have changed their policy and that all anglers are welcome on the site, regardless of their race or nationality"". He said his legal team were taking the matter ""forward"" and said he would ""provide a further update early in the New Year"". An EHRC spokeswoman said it had written to the fishery to advise it to take it down. ""It's right to challenge such out-of-date practices and any business that believes this is acceptable should think again before they find themselves facing legal action,"" she said.

Wagamama apologise after sickness threat,"Restaurant chain Wagamama has apologised after a manager warned workers they face disciplinary action for calling in sick over Christmas. A note on a rota at one of its London branches said it was the responsibility of ill staff to find colleagues to cover shifts. Wagamama said the manager ""feared team member shortages"" and ""regrettably decided to take this highly unusual approach"", which is not company policy. A union posted the rota on Facebook. A note beneath the rota states: ""No calling in sick! may I remind you that if you are unable to come in for your shift it is your responsibility [underlined] to find someone to cover your shift (as per contract and handbook). ""Calling in sick during the next 2 weeks will result in disciplinary action being taken"". Wagamama insisted the rule was ""strictly not company policy"", and said it was an ""isolated incident"" at its North Finchley restaurant. A spokesman for the Unite Hospitality union said: ""To threaten workers with disciplinary action for being sick is not just morally reprehensible, it may be unlawful under the Health and Safety Act and Equality Act as it discriminates against those with long-term physical or mental health conditions."" The pan-Asian chain, which has been owned by the London-based private equity firm Duke Street Capital since 2011, has more than 100 branches across the UK. A Wagamama spokesperson said: ""Following reports of a notice posted in our North Finchley restaurant we can confirm this was an isolated incident and is strictly not company employment policy. ""The manager involved feared team member shortages over the festive period and regrettably decided to take this highly unusual approach. ""As a company we treat all our team with the greatest respect and understand and appreciate the hard work they all do. We sincerely apologise for what has happened and wish all our team members and customers a very Merry Christmas and a Happy New Year."" The person who brought the rota to Unite Hospitality's attention is a friend of someone who works at Wagamama in North Finchley. ""They sent me that picture,"" he told the BBC. ""They didn't want me to share it at all. But my blood was boiling. I needed to do something about it. ""I don't believe it is company policy. It might have been an idea of the manager because he doesn't know the law."" The rota was put up at Wagamama's branch in North Finchley He said the note attached to the rota could be ""dangerous for the health and safety of people"". ""If you force people to work when they are sick they can poison the food. There is something very wrong."" He said many of the staff at that branch were young workers from Eastern Europe and ""maybe they are scared to lose their jobs or they don't know the law themselves"". The Green MSP for the West Scotland region, Ross Greer, was one of the first people to post a photograph of the rota on Twitter, writing: ""That's the end of my custom with @wagamama_uk. Treat your staff with some respect."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Speaking on the Christmas edition of BBC Radio 4'sDesert Island Discs, he dedicated Rod Stewart's version of the Beatles' In My Life to his loved ones. He said: ""They are still part of me... I'm getting emotional"". The star also told how he avoided Italian military service by telling a top official he was gay. Tonioli joined the BBC TV dance contest show when it first aired in 2004 and has become one of its best-known faces. His first break was in theatre with a touring Parisian company and he then went on to work in London in the 1980s as a choreographer for stars including Bananarama, the Rolling Stones and Elton John. His mother died in 1994. He told presenter Kirsty Young that In My Life was ""one of the best poems ever written"" - citing its lyrics ""All these places had their moments/With lovers and friends I still can recall/Some are dead and some are living/In my life I've loved them all."" Tonioli said: ""This song is dedicated to all the people that have passed away.... ""In spite of what has happened in my life, I might have moved away - hopefully I will keep moving - but they are still part of me, they are still... I'm getting emotional.""

The schedule forced him tomiss a weekend of this year's Strictly, but he defended himself against reports that the absence was connected to his personal relationship. ""It was a total overlap all the way through,"" Tonioli said. ""I said, 'You have to give me a week off because I don't have time for my body to re-energise,' and it was agreed. I didn't just say I didn't want to do it. I would never do that, I'm a pro."" Tonioli also talked about avoiding military service after telling a top official he was gay, which was not permitted in the Italian armed forces at the time. He said: ""He was actually very nice and said he understood I was not pretending. ""What happened, and I have never told anybody, was that somebody got a whiff and said they would call my parents' house and tell them I'm a queen. So I said, 'Well, do it, who cares?'.""

"Navalny 'nominated to run' against PutinThe Russian politician says he can now challenge Vladimir Putin, but remains officially barred.2m2 minutes agoEurope","This video can not be played Mr Navalny's supporters gathered in a huge tent on the outskirts of Moscow Russian opposition politician Alexei Navalny says he has gathered enough nominations to challenge Vladimir Putin in March's presidential election. His supporters met in 20 cities across the country to secure the signatures. Mr Navalny is still unlikely to run as election officials ruled him ineligible because of a corruption conviction which he says is politically motivated. Mr Navalny spoke at the Moscow gathering, branding Mr Putin a ""bad president"". He told his supporters in a marquee on a snowy riverbank that he would call a boycott of the election if he were not allowed to stand. Mr Navalny is widely regarded as the only candidate with a chance of challenging the president, who is seeking a fourth term that would see him become the longest-serving Russian leader since Joseph Stalin. Russian socialite and TV presenter Ksenia Sobchak is standing in the electionbut some  - including Mr Navalny - regard her as a ""Kremlin stooge"". Alexei Navalny barred from Russia presidential poll Navalny wins European human rights payout Putin to run again for Russian president Profile: Alexei Navalny Separately on Sunday,  an opposition rally called by activist Ilya Yashin was held in the north-west of the capital. Dozens attended the rally, which was streamed live on Facebook by Radio Liberty, chanting ""Russia will be free"" and ""Putin is a thief"". Police declared it ""illegal and provocative"" and vowed to act in ""strict accordance with the law"". However, no-one was detained. By Sarah Rainsford, BBC News, Moscow This meeting in a giant tent on a snowy Moscow riverbank has secured Alexei Navalny well over the 500 signatures he needs to be nominated as candidate. His supporters queued from early morning, cheering and chanting Mr Navalny's name as the finally tally was announced. The anti-corruption campaigner then appeared on stage with his wife and children to a blast of music, giving it all a touch of the American campaign rally.  There was even a burst of red, white and blue confetti. On stage, Alexei Navalny told the crowd that Vladimir Putin does not have the mass support he claims. He insists on the right to run against him, to prove that. His strategy is to try to force the authorities to register him. So if his candidacy is now blocked, despite today's nomination meeting, he's vowed to go on fighting - calling for strikes, an election boycott and street protests. Mr Navalny, 41, needed 500 nominations to secure his nomination. He later tweeted that he had secured the signatures, saying: ""I have become an official candidate nominated by activist groups of voters. Many thanks to those who have taken part in this campaign in all corners of our country. You are the best."" He will hope securing the signatures will pressure the election commission into allowing him to run. The commission's head, Ella Pamfilova, said earlier in the month that because of Mr Navalny's conviction he would be unable to stand and suggested he tried running again in 2028. However, more recently she has said that the commission will examine the candidacy of every presidential hopeful who follows the necessary procedure. Mr Navalny said Mr Putin had during his 18 years in power taken ""from poor people oil, gas and metal worth trillions of dollars, sold it abroad, rewarded those people by turning them from poor to destitute"".

Take pride in Christian heritage - May,"Britons should ""take pride"" in their country's Christian heritage at Christmas, Theresa May has said. In her Christmas message, the prime minister said there is a ""confidence... that in Britain you can practise your faith free from question or fear"". She also praised the emergency services for their Grenfell Tower and Manchester and London terror attacks responses. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn's message says people should help those ""cut off and lonely"", and in war-torn nations. The Lib Dem Leader Vince Cable spoke of the need for more affordable housing, and mental health support, whileSNP First Minister Nicola Sturgeon paid tribute to people working as volunteersat Christmas. Mrs May began her message by thanking ""those whose service to others means they will be spending time away from their loved ones this Christmas"". She paid tribute to the ""men and women in our armed forces, whose humbling bravery and daily sacrifices help to ensure the security of our nation and our allies around the world. And she spoke of ""the heroes in our emergency services, whose courage and dedication so inspired the nation in response to tragedy at Grenfell Tower and the abhorrent terrorist attacks in Manchester and London."" 'Valiant' troops keeping UK safe - May's message to armed forces Trump still on May's Christmas card list MPs hit back at abusive Christmas messages Mrs May also praised volunteers who give up their time at Christmas to take on faith inspired projects, and aid agency staff working abroad. The prime minister, who grew up in a vicarage, added: ""As we celebrate the birth of Christ, let us celebrate all those selfless acts - and countless others - that epitomise the values we share: Christian values of love, service and compassion that are lived out every day in our country by people all faiths and none."" Mrs May referred to Christians in some parts of the Middle East being denied religious freedoms and the ""sickening persecution of the Rohingya Muslims"". She concluded: ""This Christmas, whatever our faith, let us come together confident and united in the values we share."" Mr Corbyn said Christmas was ""a time of the year when we think about others. Like those who have no home to call their own or who are sleeping rough on our streets. ""We think about those who feel cut off and lonely. Many older citizens to whom we owe so much will be spending what should be a time of joy alone. ""We think of others such as carers who look after loved ones, people with disabilities or dementia."" This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn delivers his Christmas message He said thoughts were also with those ""living in nations like Yemen, Syria and Libya in fear of bombs and bullets, of injury and death"". He said: ""None of this is inevitable. We pride ourselves on being a compassionate nation. ""My Christmas wish is that we all do more to help bring about the kind of society and world we want to live in."" In her message, Ms Sturgeon said Christmas was a time of celebration, but also a ""time for thinking about and helping others"". The SNP leader added: ""For many people - for example workers in our emergency services, our health service and in our armed forces - Christmas isn't a holiday at all. ""Your hard work is appreciated all the year round, but is particularly valued at Christmas time. So over this festive period, let's thank those who are working so hard on our behalf.""

Trump Turnberry will not get tax relief,"Donald Trump's Turnberry resort in South Ayrshire is now above the cut-off point for tax relief A Scottish golf resort owned by US President Donald Trump will no longer qualify for a controversial tax break. A change in the Scottish government's recent budget will remove Trump Turnberry in South Ayrshire from a business rates relief scheme. The Sunday Herald revealed,externalthe resort is now above the cut-off point with a rateable value of Â£1,650,000. Scotland's finance secretary Derek Mackay introduced measures in February to help hospitality businesses. The move was in response to growing pressure to intervene to help struggling restaurants and hotels cope with the first revaluation of the rateable value of businesses since 2010. Mr Mackay faced calls to reform the transitional business rates relief scheme afterit emerged in August that Trump Turnberry had benefited by Â£109,530 for 2017/18. In response to a wider review of the business rates system, Mr Mackay announced in September that the transitional scheme would continue next year for ""all but the very largest hospitality properties"". Documents published alongside the draft Scottish budget earlier this month state it will only apply for hospitality properties with a rateable value up to Â£1.5m. According to the Scottish Assessors Association website, Trump Turnberry is now above the cut-off point with a rateable value of Â£1,650,000. Mr Trump bought Turnberry in 2014 but stepped away from the family business empire after being elected US president. His other Scottish golf course, on the Menie estate in Aberdeenshire, did not qualify for relief because it is defined as a golf course rather than a hotel.

Drug dealer mistakes police car for taxi,"Police said the man was carrying about 1,000 joints An alleged drug dealer in Copenhagen received an unwanted surprise for Christmas when he jumped into the back of a taxi with about 1,000 joints on him, only to find it was a police car. Danish police said the man was rushing home when he made the grave error. The mistake occurred in Christiania, a semi-autonomous district of the capital founded by hippies in the 1970s and known as a centre for the drug trade. Police said the man could face a custodial sentence. The full statement from the force earlier in the week read: ""Last night a cannabis dealer from Christiania who wanted to get home quickly got into a taxi. He received a big surprise when he realised it was actually a police car he was sitting in. ""The police officers were happy to see him, since he was carrying around 1,000 joints."" Cannabis is illegal in Denmark, with prohibitions on dealing and possession. Police have carried out a number of raids in the Christiania district in recent months, mostly seeking out drug dealers rather than the other way around. Could medical marijuana help your dog?

Vice admits 'boy's club' culture,"Vice began life as a free magazine covering sex, drugs, and streetwear Digital media company Vice has admitted to a ""boy's club"" culture that failed to protect women staff from harassment. Co-founders Shane Smith and Suroosh Alvi said in a statement that the company had taken action over ""multiple instances of unacceptable behavior"". The statement came in response to an in-depthNew York Times investigation,external. Vice began life as a free magazine with a reputation for edgy coverage of youth culture, but has since been backed by major corporations including Fox. But Mr Smith and Mr Alvi acknowledged in their statement that the company's roots had contributed to unprofessional conduct that persisted though its rapid growth. They said: ""Cultural elements from our past, dysfunction and mismanagement were allowed to flourish unchecked. That includes a detrimental ""boy's club"" culture that fostered inappropriate behavior that permeated throughout the company."" Vice co-founders Shane Smith and Suroosh Alvi More than two dozen women told the New York Times they had ""experienced or witnessed sexual misconduct,"" including unwanted kisses, lewd remarks, propositions and groping. ""There is a toxic environment,"" said Sandra Miller, a former Vice executive, ""where men can say the most disgusting things and... where women are treated far inferior than men."" The revelations make Vice the latest in a long list of companies and public bodies, including Ford car company and the US Congress, to face sexual harassment allegations against members and staff, triggered by revelations about the film producer Harvey Weinstein. More on sexual harassment Weinstein: How the scandal unfolded The music industry's dark side exposed Fashion models speak out Matt Damon faces backlash for harassment comments The New York Times report on Vice outlines four settlements reached by the company with staff who alleged sexual harassment or defamation. One involved a 2003 interview by a freelance journalist, Jessica Hopper, with the rapper Murs, in which Ms Hopper wrote that the rapper propositioned her for sex and she said no. Before her article was published however, the magazine changed her response to ""Yes"" and printed it. According to records seen by the Times, Vice reached a settlement with Ms Hopper and printed a retraction. The company statement outlined steps it had taken to reform its workplace culture, including the hiring of a new HR director, a commitment to pay equity, and an advisory board including feminist icon Gloria Steinem. First published in Canada in 1994 and distributed for free in clothing shops, Vice expanded rapidly with investment from major corporations.

World's largest amphibious plane takes off,"This video can not be played The AG600 is roughly the size of a Boeing 737 A Chinese amphibious aircraft, the largest in production, has made a successful one-hour maiden flight. The plane, roughly the size of a Boeing 737 but with four turboprop engines, took off from Zhuhai airport in the southern province of Guangdong. The plane can carry 50 people and can stay airborne for 12 hours. It has firefighting and marine rescue duties but also military applications, which could be put to use in the disputed South China Sea region. The AG600, codenamed Kunlong, can reach the southernmost edge of China's territorial claims in the area. State media Xinhua described the plane as ""protector spirit of the sea, islands and reefs"". The take-off of the flight was carried live on state television and its return was greeted by flag-waving crowds and military music. The plane has been eight years in development, has a maximum take-off weight of 53.5 tonnes and a wingspan of 38.8m (127ft). There are 17 orders already from within China. China's policy on the South China Sea is hotly contested by a number of neighbouring countries andlast year a tribunal dismissed Beijing's claims to much of the region. Though sizeable, the AG600 is dwarfed by the famous flying boat of billionaire Howard Hughes. Howard Hughes atop the Spruce Goose ahead of its maiden, and only flight, in 1947 The Spruce Goose, or more technically the Hughes H-4 Hercules, had a wingspan of 97.54m. However it made only one flight, which lasted about 26 seconds, in 1947, and never flew again. It is on display in a museum in Oregon. Spruce Goose 'could have flown' Who needs an 84m-long aircraft? The Martin Mars seaplane was made by the Glenn L Martin Company as a World War Two transporter for the US Navy and has a wingspan of 61 metres (200ft). Some were later adapted as water bombers and have been in service in Canada on firefighting duties. The Russian-built Beriev A-40 Albatros had a wingspan of 41.62m, but only two were fully or partially built. The first flight was in 1986 and the project was suspended. There have been unconfirmed reports of a revival and a small batch ordered by the Russian navy, but what form the plane will take is unclear.

London Zoo reopens after blaze,"The zoo reopened on Sunday after being shut on Saturday after the fire London Zoo has reopened following a fire which killed a number of animals and left several staff needing medical attention. An aardvark called Misha died and it is thought meerkats Robbie, Norman, Billy and Nigel were also killed. One person was taken to hospital and eight were treated at the scene. The zoo said families had offered to help clear up and local builders were offering help with rebuilding enclosures. About 70 firefighters tackled the blaze in the Animal Adventure section that spread to a shop. The cause of the fire is till unclear. Families who had tickets for the zoo's Meet Santa experience on Saturday will be offered refunds, the zoo said. This video can not be played London Zoo 'devastated' by aardvark fire death Photographs posted on social media showed orange flames rising from the building London Zoo reopened on Christmas Eve following the fire Ten fire engines went to the zoo, which is in Regent's Park, shortly after 06:00 GMT on Saturday. The fire was brought under control about three hours later. In a statement the zoo said it was devastated about what had happened but was overwhelmed by the support of the community. ""While it's been heartening to hear the chatter of excited children back in the zoo again today, our work investigating all aspects of the fire continues"", Dominic Jermey, director general at ZSL said. ""One important update is that our vets completed an initial post-mortem on Misha, the aardvark; they have concluded that she most likely died from smoke inhalation whilst asleep in her den. ""Sadly though, after a thorough search of the site, we must presume that our four meerkats - brothers Robbie, Norman, Billy and Nigel - have died. ""We've been overwhelmed by the hundreds of emails, phone calls and letters of support from all over the country - these kind and generous messages range from families offering to give up their Christmas Day to help us clean up, to offers from local builders to rebuild the enclosures for us.""

Anti-social powers must be 'proportionate',"New guidance on the use of anti-social behaviour powers has been issued to ensure they are reasonably applied. The Home Office told councils and police in England and Wales the laws should not be used on the vulnerable. It comes amid concerns orders were being used to target buskers, rough sleepers, dog walkers and groups gathering to chat in town centres. Victoria Atkins, minister for crime, safeguarding and vulnerability, said powers should be used proportionately. She said: ""We know that these powers are being used to very good effect by the police and local councils across England and Wales, and we are very keen to encourage their continued use. ""But we are also clear that the powers should be used proportionately to tackle anti-social behaviour, and not to target specific groups or the most vulnerable in our communities."" The guidance,externalfollows feedback from charities and other groups that the orders were being used to disproportionately target certain groups, including rough sleepers. Hundreds of fines have been issued for violations such as playing music too loudly in cars andnot having a dog on a lead. Martha Spurrier, director of campaign group Liberty, said some councils were ""compassionless"" in applying orders on vulnerable people. ""In the last year, very sadly, six people have been sent to prison for being homeless as a result of these orders,"" she said. ""They've gone very off-piste and have been used by these local councils in a pretty compassionless way - so that poverty effectively ends up being criminalised."" Local agencies, including councils, police and social landlords, have six powers to tackle anti-social behaviour - the civil injunction, criminal behaviour order, community protection notice, public spaces protection order, closure power, and the dispersal power. They were introduced in 2014 after the government overhauled old anti-social behaviour powers, believing they were ineffective. The revised guidelines state orders should be focused on ""specific behaviours and are proportionate to the detrimental effect that the behaviour is causing or can cause, and are necessary to prevent it from continuing, occurring or recurring"". The Home Office said parents often cannot do a ""great deal"" to stop a baby crying Anyone issuing an order should ask themselves if the behaviour in question is unreasonable, the guidance states.

London Zoo to reopen after fire,"The zoo reopened on Sunday after being shut on Saturday after the fire London Zoo has reopened following a fire which killed a number of animals and left several staff needing medical attention. An aardvark called Misha died and it is thought meerkats Robbie, Norman, Billy and Nigel were also killed. One person was taken to hospital and eight were treated at the scene. The zoo said families had offered to help clear up and local builders were offering help with rebuilding enclosures. About 70 firefighters tackled the blaze in the Animal Adventure section that spread to a shop. The cause of the fire is till unclear.

The fire was brought under control about three hours later. In a statement the zoo said it was devastated about what had happened but was overwhelmed by the support of the community. ""While it's been heartening to hear the chatter of excited children back in the zoo again today, our work investigating all aspects of the fire continues"", Dominic Jermey, director general at ZSL said. ""One important update is that our vets completed an initial post-mortem on Misha, the aardvark; they have concluded that she most likely died from smoke inhalation whilst asleep in her den. ""Sadly though, after a thorough search of the site, we must presume that our four meerkats - brothers Robbie, Norman, Billy and Nigel - have died. ""We've been overwhelmed by the hundreds of emails, phone calls and letters of support from all over the country - these kind and generous messages range from families offering to give up their Christmas Day to help us clean up, to offers from local builders to rebuild the enclosures for us.""

Rescuers seek victims of Philippines storm,"Bridges and roads have been destroyed Badly-damaged infrastructure is hampering relief efforts following a deadly tropical storm in the southern Philippines, the local Red Cross says. Bridges and roads on the island of Mindanao have been destroyed or blocked by landslides, Richard Gordon told the BBC. Some 200 people have died and at least 70,000 have been displaced by Tropical Storm Tembin. Rescuers say people were surprised by the strength of the storm. Nearly 1,000 houses have been wrecked and many rice-fields washed away, Mr Gordon said. About 150 people are still missing. Continuing heavy rain, power cuts and blocked roads are creating difficulties for rescuers, who have not yet reached some affected areas. Residents in Salvador district with relief supplies United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was saddened by the loss of life, adding that the UN was ready to help. Police said 135 people had been killed and 72 were missing in northern Mindanao. Forty-seven were killed and 72 missing in the Zamboanga peninsula. In Lanao del Sur, another 18 died. Who cleans up after hurricanes, earthquakes and war? Economic losses from natural disasters counted Between 40,000 and 60,000 people are reported to be housed in evacuation centres. The mountain village of Dalama was one of the worst affected places. Houses were buried in mud or engulfed in floodwaters. This video can not be played The aftermath of Storm Tembin on Mindanao island ""The flood was already close and the people were not able to get out from their homes,"" survivor Armando Sangcopan told local TV. The bodies of eight children were extracted from thick mud in the town of Salvador in Lanao del Norte, theInquirer,externalreports. ""It's very painful to see the dead bodies of children, whom we also considered to be our own,"" the principal, Ricardo Abalo, told the paper. Aid workers said people had not heeded warnings to evacuate before Tembin arrived, either because they believed the storm would not be severe or they had nowhere else to go. Many victims were swept away from low-lying residential areas when the flash floods and landslides struck. More deaths were reported in Bukidnon, Iligan and Misamis Occidental. Andrew Morris, from the UN children's agency Unicef in Mindanao, said in some areas there were big risks of disease, particularly for children, and restoring clean water supplies would be a priority. ""Lanao del Sur province is the poorest in the Philippines, and in the past seven months there have been around 350,000 people displaced in that province because of fighting,"" he told the BBC, referring to battles between government forces and Islamist militants in Marawi. A week ago, Tropical Storm Kai-Tak hit the central Philippines, killing dozens. The region is still recovering from Typhoon Haiyan, which killed more than 5,000 people and affected millions in 2013.

"Anti-social powers must be 'proportionate'Home Office tells councils in England and Wales to avoid using anti-social orders on the ""vulnerable"".3m3 minutes agoUK","New guidance on the use of anti-social behaviour powers has been issued to ensure they are reasonably applied. The Home Office told councils and police in England and Wales the laws should not be used on the vulnerable. It comes amid concerns orders were being used to target buskers, rough sleepers, dog walkers and groups gathering to chat in town centres. Victoria Atkins, minister for crime, safeguarding and vulnerability, said powers should be used proportionately. She said: ""We know that these powers are being used to very good effect by the police and local councils across England and Wales, and we are very keen to encourage their continued use. ""But we are also clear that the powers should be used proportionately to tackle anti-social behaviour, and not to target specific groups or the most vulnerable in our communities."" The guidance,externalfollows feedback from charities and other groups that the orders were being used to disproportionately target certain groups, including rough sleepers. Hundreds of fines have been issued for violations such as playing music too loudly in cars andnot having a dog on a lead. Martha Spurrier, director of campaign group Liberty, said some councils were ""compassionless"" in applying orders on vulnerable people. ""In the last year, very sadly, six people have been sent to prison for being homeless as a result of these orders,"" she said. ""They've gone very off-piste and have been used by these local councils in a pretty compassionless way - so that poverty effectively ends up being criminalised."" Local agencies, including councils, police and social landlords, have six powers to tackle anti-social behaviour - the civil injunction, criminal behaviour order, community protection notice, public spaces protection order, closure power, and the dispersal power. They were introduced in 2014 after the government overhauled old anti-social behaviour powers, believing they were ineffective. The revised guidelines state orders should be focused on ""specific behaviours and are proportionate to the detrimental effect that the behaviour is causing or can cause, and are necessary to prevent it from continuing, occurring or recurring"". The Home Office said parents often cannot do a ""great deal"" to stop a baby crying Anyone issuing an order should ask themselves if the behaviour in question is unreasonable, the guidance states. ""For instance, a baby crying in the middle of the night may well have a detrimental effect on immediate neighbours and is likely to be persistent in nature,"" it said. ""However, it is unlikely to be reasonable to issue the parents with a Community Protection Notice if there is not a great deal that they can do to control or affect the behaviour."" Simon Blackburn, chairman of the Local Government Association's safer and stronger communities board, said: ""Many anti-social behaviour offences are serious issues for local residents and businesses, and councils are keen to protect them from offenders who can make the lives of those they target a misery.

"Peru ex-leader Fujimori taken to hospitalThe 79-year-old has low blood pressure and an abnormal heart rhythm, his doctor says.7h7 hours agoLatin America & Caribbean","Alberto Fujimori remains a deeply divisive figure in Peru Peru's former President Alberto Fujimori has been taken from prison to a hospital because of low blood pressure and abnormal heart rhythm. His doctor was quoted by local media as saying cardiologists had advised the 79-year-old needed urgent treatment. Fujimori - who was in power from 1990 to 2000 - is serving a 25-year sentence for human rights abuses. He is admired by some Peruvians for combating Maoist rebels. His critics consider him a corrupt dictator. In 2007, Fujimori was sentenced to six years in jail for bribery and abuse of power. In 2009, he was sentenced to another 25 years in prison for human rights abuses committed during his time in office, including authorising killings carried out by death squads. He has been in and out of hospital for a variety of health problems in recent years. The latest medical emergency comes just days afterFujimori's supporters in Congress helped President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski avoid impeachmentover alleged corruption. Opposition politicians allege that the president had promised the supporters to free Fujimori in exchange for their backing. Mr Kuczynski denies the claim.

Christmas Day: Just another day at the office," Former primary school teacher Katie Anderson would have been guaranteed Christmas off in her previous job. But now that she runs Muddy Boots Farm in Burnham-on-Crouch, Essex, she will be up at the crack of dawn feeding her goats, sheep, pigs, chickens and ducks. “This is the first year that I’ve had so many animals. “None of my family live locally so I have to drive to them and get back before it gets dark and feed all the animals, which is going to be quite a task.” But she says most of the livestock will be spoilt this Christmas. “I’m sure there’ll be some treats for them and biscuits for the goats. “But a lot of the animals – the turkeys – won’t be with us for Christmas. That’ll be a treat for me.” “There’s something quite special about the gas lamps over the festive period,” says British Gas engineer Iain Bell. “When you’re walking through an area like Covent Garden, you get the festive windows on one side and the gas lamps on another. There’s nothing more romantic and beautiful than the mellow lighting.” Iain and his team of four engineers are the custodians of these Victorian antiques, which instil the warm glow of a Dickensian Christmas. The team will be hard at work over Christmas maintaining the 1,500 lights in London, which are mainly situated in Westminster, the royal parks and estates, and Kensington. The quiet streets during the holiday provide the perfect opportunity for the engineers to get on their ladders, manually wind up some of the lamp timers, and keep on top of maintenance. Since 2005, keeper Jon Ovens has spent six Christmases with the animals at Longleat reserve. “It’s a 365-day job, someone has to be there to make sure the animals are ok,” he says. When he began the job in his early 20s, his friends would quip “why don’t you give the animals twice the amount of food on Christmas Eve?"" But the job of a keeper is more than just feeding and watering the animals. Starting at 8.30 am, about a dozen keepers do a head count, check on the animals welfare, clean any enclosures, as well as giving  the animals their Christmas dinner. “We get about 45 minutes for lunch rather than half an hour. It is Christmas after all.” He says the team make sure they mark the day with party food on their rounds, and in previous years they have been known to play a game or two of Twister. The Red Funnel ferry between Southampton and the Isle of Wight helps get people from the mainland to their nearest and dearest on 25 December. Captain Jodi Le Breton will be leading the service to and from the island. Having worked on cruise ships over the festive period, he is used to spending Christmas Day away from his family. “I think it’s good that we keep the island connected over Christmas, the atmosphere on board is very good.” Jodi says there are often “a lot of grandchildren going to see their grandparents on the island” in the morning, and then getting the last ferry of the day  back at 1.30 pm. The service is vital for people in a last-minute rush to get home, he says. “We’ve had people who’ve been delayed on flights [on Christmas Eve], so this gives them the opportunity to spend Christmas Day with their families.” “There needs to be an appropriate level of nerves… it’s a national moment,” says Phil Vowels, who will be introducing the Queen’s speech on Christmas Day. The continuity announcer has narrated the nation’s Christmas on BBC One 10 times, since starting at the corporation in 1997. “You need to be very mindful that you have a much bigger audience over Christmas Day.” Unlike most mid-afternoons, families will be sitting down and watching the television together. “In terms of what we say on air - we try and reflect that and ask, ‘have you opened all your presents yet?’ Or ‘is uncle so-and-so asleep in the chair?’” As Phil writes all the links to programmes himself, he will already know the explosive ending to the EastEnders Christmas special. But when asked what happens between Max Branning and Phil Mitchell, his lips are sealed. “It’s an early present in that way, but I can’t be bribed. I have to be above all that.” “For shift workers, Christmas just tends to be another working day. If you work over the holidays, Christmas seems to lose all its hype,” says Graham Wallis. The 57-year-old has worked six Christmas periods on Clifton Suspension Bridge, in Bristol. “I’ve been a shift worker for 12 or 13 years so the family are pretty used to it.” On Christmas Day, he will be one of two attendants providing assistance to drivers. “It does seem to be extremely quiet until just after lunchtime,” when families start to take a stroll after their roast dinners, he says. “Getting to the end of the day you will hardly see a soul, or any cars. It’s quite eerie actually.” Built with Shorthand"
Free boarding school places for care kids,"Boarding schools in England are to offer free places to children with links to the care system, the Department for Education has announced. Local authorities will work with children's charities to put forward pupils for bursaries and scholarships. It is part of a government pledge to get independent and state schools working more closely together and help students from ""vulnerable"" backgrounds. About 1,000 young people are already being supported by similar schemes. The DfE said theBoarding School Partnerships,externalaimed to help children of both primary and secondary age who have previously been in care or are at risk of going into care. It says research shows a correlation between the boarding environment and improved educational outcomes for vulnerable children. Parliamentary Under Secretary of State for the School System Lord Agnew said: ""Children who have previously been in care or are at risk of care have often gone through difficult, challenging experiences that can have a lasting impact throughout their lives. ""These placements won't be right for every child, but the pastoral care and educational support provided by our top boarding schools can have profound benefits for some young people."" Both independent boarding schools and state boarding schools - those funded by local authorities but where fees are charged for accommodation - are taking part in the scheme, which is backed by the Boarding Schools' Association. The charities involved are the Reedham Children's Trust,  Buttle UK and the Royal National Children's Springboard Foundation. Two Surrey schools, King Edward's Witley, and the Royal Alexandra & Albert in Reigate, have been named as participants, with others across the country also said to be involved. John Attwater, headmaster of King Edward's Witley, said boarding could provide a ""life-transforming opportunity for vulnerable children and their families and it is core to our founding mission as a school"". It is understood that some local authorities could save money in the long-run because the cost of an annual boarding school placement is much cheaper than foster care. Labour, however, has called the announcement ""flimsy"" and says the government has already taken money out of children's services. The announcement comes after Education Secretary Justine Greening announced aÂ£23m fund to support bright children from poorer backgroundsin England whose talent might otherwise be ""wasted"".

"California fire largest in state historyThe Thomas fire has now burned an area greater than New York City, Brussels and Paris combined.22ha day agoUS & Canada","Satellite imagery shows the vast Thomas Fire, north of Los Angeles, which has spread as far as the Pacific coast A deadly wildfire which has destroyed more than 700 homes in California is now the largest blaze in the state's recorded history. The Thomas fire has burned more than 1000sq km - an area greater than New York City, Brussels and Paris combined. The blaze broke out in Santa Paula in early December and has moved west towards the coast, one of several major fires in California in recent months. Thousands of firefighters have been deployed to bring it under control. Most of California's largest wildfires have been recorded this century. Scientists say the warming climate and spread of buildings into wilderness areas have contributed. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The Thomas fire slowly eclipsed previous record-setting blazes, finally overtaking the 2003 Cedar fire in San Diego County, which burned 273,246 acres. It follows a series of deadly fires in the state's wine country in October that burned more than 10,000 homes and killed more than 40 people. The Thomas fire has destroyed more than 1,000 buildings and claimed the life of one firefighter - Cory Iverson, a father of one from San Diego whose wife was expecting another child. Development has encroached into wilderness, contributing to the wildfires State fire agency Cal Fire says the Thomas blaze is now 65% contained and expected to continue to slow. Controlled burns by firefighters may cause some temporary expansion, it said. Seven of California's 10 largest fires on record have occurred since 2000. Two were in the 1970s and the earliest was in 1932 - the Matilija fire which, like the Thomas fire, burned through Ventura County.

May praises UK's 'valiant' troops,"This video can not be played The PM praised troops for their high standards and devotion to duty The prime minister has used her Christmas message to the armed forces to pay tribute to the ""valiant hearts"" of British servicemen and women who are working to keep the UK safe. Theresa May said the RAF, and soldiers training and supporting Iraqi forces, have helped tackle the threat of the so-called Islamic State group in 2017. And she referenced troops on UK streets after terror attacks. She praised the sacrifice of those who could not be home for Christmas. Mrs May also paid tribute to the Royal Navy for helping to bring disaster relief to people in the Caribbean in the wake of Hurricane Irma. Allow Twitter content?

Mrs May beganher message,externalby referring to the centenary commemorations for the World War One battle of Passchendaele in Belgium. She said the nation remembered the hundreds of thousands of young men who died ""in the cause of freedom"". ""Through a century of great change since, the high standards and devotion to duty of our armed forces have remained constant,"" she said. The prime minister added: ""Whenever you are called upon - regulars or reserves - you always give of your best and inspire us all with your service."" But she said the achievements of the armed forces were ""made possible by the love and support of your families"". ""Partners and children are often called on to make huge sacrifices of their own - from a change of school or job, to coping with extended periods of separation,"" she said. ""That separation is especially difficult at Christmas time, and we should all be immensely grateful for that sacrifice."" She added: ""This Christmas, as people across the United Kingdom celebrate this special time of year with their families and friends, we will do so secure in the knowledge that the valiant hearts of our servicemen and women, many far away from their own loved ones at this special time of year, are working to keep us safe."" On Friday, Mrs May visited troops at the RAF base in Cyprus, where operations against IS have been launched, and last month she met UK military personnel stationed in Iraq.

Abusive messages criticised,"MPs have revealed some of the abusive, threatening and racist messages sent to them in the build-up to Christmas. They include a racist card targeting shadow home secretary Diane Abbott which said ""stop Labour stealing our white Christmas"". Tory Zac Goldsmith tweeted a card he received which wished him a ""cancerous New Year"". Last week a watchdog raised concern about the ""vile and shocking abuse"" of politicians. The Committee on Standards in Public Life said an ""intensely hostile online environment"" had been created and warned people would be put off from entering politics because of the abuse. Labour MP fears being pushed off a tube platform MPs speak out about 'sinister' election abuse May condemns abuse of MPs over Brexit Its report found that Ms Abbott received more online abuse than any other female MP. The Hackney North and Stoke Newington MP has previously described receiving a torrent of ""mindless"" racist and sexist abuse, which has been ""turbocharged"" by the speed and anonymity of social media. Her Labour colleague Clive Lewis shared the racist Christmas card that attacked her, which was received by leader Jeremy Corbyn. Mr Lewis tweeted: ""I'm not keen on sharing racist propaganda but I think it's important folk see the kind of hate Diane is subjected to for doing nothing more than standing up for her beliefs."" Several other MPs have since tweeted expressing their support for Ms Abbott. Another MP on the receiving end of abuse is Labour's David Lammy, who shared an email he received giving a ""friendly warning"" he could ""suffer the same fate as Jo Cox"", the Labour MP who was murdered last year. ""If this is meant to be a subtle way of intimidating me, scaring me or stopping me raising important issues as an elected representative it isn't going to work,"" he said. Mr Lammy, the MP for Tottenham, shared more abusive mail he received on Thursday. On Wednesday, Mr Goldsmith, who represents Richmond Park, tweeted what he said was a ""sweet message"" from people criticising his support for Brexit. As well as wishing cancer on him, it included abusive language, branding him ""nasty"" and ""a total disgrace"". This video can not be played MPs are 'never mutineers nor traitors' At the weekend, rebel Conservative MPs revealed the threats they had received after the government was defeated on its Brexit bill. Two of them, Anna Soubry and Nicky Morgan, said they had contacted the police. Abusive emails seen by the BBC included one which said ""you should hang for your crimes"" and another saying, ""I hope you do live the rest of your life looking over your shoulder in fear"". Publishing his report earlier this month, Lord Bew, the chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said: ""The increasing prevalence of intimidation of Parliamentary candidates, and others in public life, should concern everyone who cares about our democracy. ""This is not about defending elites from justified criticism or preventing the public from scrutinising those who represent them: it is about defending the fundamental structures of political freedom.""

Rescuers seek Philippines storm victims,"Bridges and roads have been destroyed Badly-damaged infrastructure is hampering relief efforts following a deadly tropical storm in the southern Philippines, the local Red Cross says. Bridges and roads on the island of Mindanao have been destroyed or blocked by landslides, Richard Gordon told the BBC. Some 200 people have died and at least 70,000 have been displaced by Tropical Storm Tembin. Rescuers say people were surprised by the strength of the storm. Nearly 1,000 houses have been wrecked and many rice-fields washed away, Mr Gordon said. About 150 people are still missing. Continuing heavy rain, power cuts and blocked roads are creating difficulties for rescuers, who have not yet reached some affected areas. Residents in Salvador district with relief supplies United Nations Secretary General Antonio Guterres said he was saddened by the loss of life, adding that the UN was ready to help. Police said 135 people had been killed and 72 were missing in northern Mindanao. Forty-seven were killed and 72 missing in the Zamboanga peninsula. In Lanao del Sur, another 18 died. Who cleans up after hurricanes, earthquakes and war? Economic losses from natural disasters counted Between 40,000 and 60,000 people are reported to be housed in evacuation centres. The mountain village of Dalama was one of the worst affected places. Houses were buried in mud or engulfed in floodwaters. This video can not be played The aftermath of Storm Tembin on Mindanao island ""The flood was already close and the people were not able to get out from their homes,"" survivor Armando Sangcopan told local TV. The bodies of eight children were extracted from thick mud in the town of Salvador in Lanao del Norte, theInquirer,externalreports. ""It's very painful to see the dead bodies of children, whom we also considered to be our own,"" the principal, Ricardo Abalo, told the paper. Aid workers said people had not heeded warnings to evacuate before Tembin arrived, either because they believed the storm would not be severe or they had nowhere else to go. Many victims were swept away from low-lying residential areas when the flash floods and landslides struck. More deaths were reported in Bukidnon, Iligan and Misamis Occidental. Andrew Morris, from the UN children's agency Unicef in Mindanao, said in some areas there were big risks of disease, particularly for children, and restoring clean water supplies would be a priority. ""Lanao del Sur province is the poorest in the Philippines, and in the past seven months there have been around 350,000 people displaced in that province because of fighting,"" he told the BBC, referring to battles between government forces and Islamist militants in Marawi. A week ago, Tropical Storm Kai-Tak hit the central Philippines, killing dozens. The region is still recovering from Typhoon Haiyan, which killed more than 5,000 people and affected millions in 2013.

Peru ex-leader Fujimori taken to hospital,"Alberto Fujimori remains a deeply divisive figure in Peru Peru's former President Alberto Fujimori has been taken from prison to a hospital because of low blood pressure and abnormal heart rhythm. His doctor was quoted by local media as saying cardiologists had advised the 79-year-old needed urgent treatment. Fujimori - who was in power from 1990 to 2000 - is serving a 25-year sentence for human rights abuses. He is admired by some Peruvians for combating Maoist rebels. His critics consider him a corrupt dictator. In 2007, Fujimori was sentenced to six years in jail for bribery and abuse of power. In 2009, he was sentenced to another 25 years in prison for human rights abuses committed during his time in office, including authorising killings carried out by death squads. He has been in and out of hospital for a variety of health problems in recent years. The latest medical emergency comes just days afterFujimori's supporters in Congress helped President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski avoid impeachmentover alleged corruption. Opposition politicians allege that the president had promised the supporters to free Fujimori in exchange for their backing. Mr Kuczynski denies the claim.

Tonioli in tears on Desert Island DiscsThe Strictly judge breaks down as he dedicates a Beatles song to lost friends and relatives.3m3 minutes agoUK,"This video can not be played Bruno Tonioli was speaking to Desert Island Discs presenter Kirsty Young Strictly Come Dancing judge Bruno Tonioli has broken down in tears as he recalled losing his mother, as well as friends and relatives, as a young man. Speaking on the Christmas edition of BBC Radio 4'sDesert Island Discs, he dedicated Rod Stewart's version of the Beatles' In My Life to his loved ones. He said: ""They are still part of me... I'm getting emotional"". The star also told how he avoided Italian military service by telling a top official he was gay. Tonioli joined the BBC TV dance contest show when it first aired in 2004 and has become one of its best-known faces. His first break was in theatre with a touring Parisian company and he then went on to work in London in the 1980s as a choreographer for stars including Bananarama, the Rolling Stones and Elton John. His mother died in 1994. He told presenter Kirsty Young that In My Life was ""one of the best poems ever written"" - citing its lyrics ""All these places had their moments/With lovers and friends I still can recall/Some are dead and some are living/In my life I've loved them all."" Tonioli said: ""This song is dedicated to all the people that have passed away.... ""In spite of what has happened in my life, I might have moved away - hopefully I will keep moving - but they are still part of me, they are still... I'm getting emotional."" Strictly Come Dancing 2017: Winner crowned Tonioli said filming Strictly at the same time as the US version of the show, Dancing With The Stars, in Los Angeles, had taken its toll on his health. The schedule forced him tomiss a weekend of this year's Strictly, but he defended himself against reports that the absence was connected to his personal relationship. ""It was a total overlap all the way through,"" Tonioli said. ""I said, 'You have to give me a week off because I don't have time for my body to re-energise,' and it was agreed. I didn't just say I didn't want to do it. I would never do that, I'm a pro."" Tonioli also talked about avoiding military service after telling a top official he was gay, which was not permitted in the Italian armed forces at the time. He said: ""He was actually very nice and said he understood I was not pretending. ""What happened, and I have never told anybody, was that somebody got a whiff and said they would call my parents' house and tell them I'm a queen. So I said, 'Well, do it, who cares?'.""

GP warns Santa to 'give sherry a miss'The head of the Royal College of GPs said we can all help Father Christmas get fitter this year.13h13 hours agoUK,"A leading doctor tells Santa to swap his mince pies for some of Rudolph's carrots this Christmas Father Christmas could be doing serious harm to his health by overloading with mince pies and sherry, a leading doctor has warned. Professor Helen Stokes-Lampard, head of the Royal College of GPs, said Santa could face a raft of health issues because of his diet and busy schedule. Some of his conditions could include gout, sleep deprivation and alcoholism. But we can all help Santa get a bit fitter, and inspire ourselves too, she says. Professor Stokes-Lampard said: ""He's overweight, and all of us do our bit to add to his obesity by leaving mince pies and cookies out for him, and milk or alcohol. ""If Mr Claus was a patient at my practice, I would be encouraging him to adopt a vastly healthier diet and take more exercise in the new year."" Santa could risk 'mixing up important presents' if he has too much sherry As well as running between houses, rather than riding on his sleigh, the professor thinks he should ""give the sherry a miss"" and share some of Rudolph's carrots instead. ""The human body can only process one unit of alcohol per hour, which means excessive consumption could make Santa drunk very quickly,"" she said. ""This not only increases the likelihood of him slipping in the snow or mixing up important presents, but could also lead to long-term issues affecting his mood and mental health."" So now Prof Stokes-Lampard thinks it is time for Saint Nicholas to take better care of himself and lead by example. ""Although he sets a brilliant example of good behaviour and teaches the importance of giving rather than receiving, he could probably do more to encourage healthy lifestyles - something youngsters and adults alike can benefit from,"" she says.

Tribute to festive workers,"Scotland's political leaders have paid tribute to people working over the holidays in their Christmas messages. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon visited a community cafe in Glasgow and hailed those ""thinking about and helping others"". Scottish Conservative leader Ruth Davidson thanked armed forces personnel and organisations like the Samaritans. Labour's Richard Leonard asked people to ""spare a thought"" for those who cannot spend Christmas with loved ones. And Willie Rennie, leader of the Scottish Liberal Democrats, said his party had ""turned a corner"" in 2017. Nicola Sturgeon helped prepare a Christmas dinner at a community cafe in Glasgow During a visit to Woodlands Community Cafe, the first minister paid tribute to volunteers who give up their own time to help other people. She said: ""This cafe, and the volunteers here, are among thousands of organisations and individuals throughout Scotland who do so much for our local communities - not just at Christmas, but all throughout the year. They exemplify the solidarity and compassion which is so important to our society. ""I also know that for many people - for example workers in our emergency services, our health service and in our armed forces - Christmas isn't a holiday at all. Your hard work is appreciated all the year round, but is particularly valued at Christmas time. ""So over this festive period, let's thank those who are working so hard on our behalf. And let's also - like the people here at Woodlands - do our bit to help others, and to spread some Christmas cheer."" Ruth Davidson gave a special mention to people who lost a loved one over the last year. ""The first Christmas without a spouse, sibling, child, parent or friend is always difficult and I hope they find comfort in the company of loved ones,"" she said. ""For many of us, Christmas is one of the few moments of the year when we get a chance to disengage from work and take a step back for a few days. ""After a year in which we've often seen more heat than light in our public debate, I hope the holiday season will provide us with a moment to remember what we have in common."" The party leaders got into the festive spirit for Christmas jumper day earlier this month Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said he hoped that the homeless have shelter and respite from the cold and those who rely on food banks were able to eat well over Christmas. ""Those of us who are fortunate enough to celebrate Christmas with our loved ones should spare a thought for those who are not so lucky,"" he added. ""We should think of those who cannot take time off, those who work in our emergency services over Christmas, those who devote their lives to public service, to taking care of us all, from hospitality workers to nurses, firefighters and all emergency workers, to the people keeping the lights on. ""And we should think of those refugees who have come to Scotland for sanctuary and to build a new life, and all those who are fighting to survive in too many countries riven with war or internal unrest."" Meanwhile Willie Rennie was optimistic about the future of the Scottish Liberal Democrats after success in 2017. ""We started winning elections again with more MPs and in charge of more councils,"" he said. ""I believe that winning is not just good for the Liberal Democrats but is also good for the country. ""It means that we have moderate, outward looking, optimistic voices making the case for change and challenging authority and government. ""With a bigger team of Liberal Democrats we can stand up for people who benefit from the police service, mental health services, education services and a stronger economy."" The Scottish Green Party is expected to issue its leaders' message at New Year.

MPs hit back at abusive Christmas messages,"MPs have revealed some of the abusive, threatening and racist messages sent to them in the build-up to Christmas. They include a racist card targeting shadow home secretary Diane Abbott which said ""stop Labour stealing our white Christmas"". Tory Zac Goldsmith tweeted a card he received which wished him a ""cancerous New Year"". Last week a watchdog raised concern about the ""vile and shocking abuse"" of politicians. The Committee on Standards in Public Life said an ""intensely hostile online environment"" had been created and warned people would be put off from entering politics because of the abuse. Labour MP fears being pushed off a tube platform MPs speak out about 'sinister' election abuse May condemns abuse of MPs over Brexit Its report found that Ms Abbott received more online abuse than any other female MP. The Hackney North and Stoke Newington MP has previously described receiving a torrent of ""mindless"" racist and sexist abuse, which has been ""turbocharged"" by the speed and anonymity of social media. Her Labour colleague Clive Lewis shared the racist Christmas card that attacked her, which was received by leader Jeremy Corbyn. Mr Lewis tweeted: ""I'm not keen on sharing racist propaganda but I think it's important folk see the kind of hate Diane is subjected to for doing nothing more than standing up for her beliefs."" Several other MPs have since tweeted expressing their support for Ms Abbott. Another MP on the receiving end of abuse is Labour's David Lammy, who shared an email he received giving a ""friendly warning"" he could ""suffer the same fate as Jo Cox"", the Labour MP who was murdered last year. ""If this is meant to be a subtle way of intimidating me, scaring me or stopping me raising important issues as an elected representative it isn't going to work,"" he said. Mr Lammy, the MP for Tottenham, shared more abusive mail he received on Thursday. On Wednesday, Mr Goldsmith, who represents Richmond Park, tweeted what he said was a ""sweet message"" from people criticising his support for Brexit. As well as wishing cancer on him, it included abusive language, branding him ""nasty"" and ""a total disgrace"". This video can not be played MPs are 'never mutineers nor traitors' At the weekend, rebel Conservative MPs revealed the threats they had received after the government was defeated on its Brexit bill. Two of them, Anna Soubry and Nicky Morgan, said they had contacted the police. Abusive emails seen by the BBC included one which said ""you should hang for your crimes"" and another saying, ""I hope you do live the rest of your life looking over your shoulder in fear"". Publishing his report earlier this month, Lord Bew, the chairman of the Committee on Standards in Public Life, said: ""The increasing prevalence of intimidation of Parliamentary candidates, and others in public life, should concern everyone who cares about our democracy. ""This is not about defending elites from justified criticism or preventing the public from scrutinising those who represent them: it is about defending the fundamental structures of political freedom.""

London Zoo to re-open after fire,"The zoo reopened on Sunday after being shut on Saturday after the fire London Zoo has reopened following a fire which killed a number of animals and left several staff needing medical attention. An aardvark called Misha died and it is thought meerkats Robbie, Norman, Billy and Nigel were also killed. One person was taken to hospital and eight were treated at the scene. The zoo said families had offered to help clear up and local builders were offering help with rebuilding enclosures. About 70 firefighters tackled the blaze in the Animal Adventure section that spread to a shop. The cause of the fire is till unclear. Families who had tickets for the zoo's Meet Santa experience on Saturday will be offered refunds, the zoo said. This video can not be played London Zoo 'devastated' by aardvark fire death Photographs posted on social media showed orange flames rising from the building London Zoo reopened on Christmas Eve following the fire Ten fire engines went to the zoo, which is in Regent's Park, shortly after 06:00 GMT on Saturday. The fire was brought under control about three hours later. In a statement the zoo said it was devastated about what had happened but was overwhelmed by the support of the community. ""While it's been heartening to hear the chatter of excited children back in the zoo again today, our work investigating all aspects of the fire continues"", Dominic Jermey, director general at ZSL said. ""One important update is that our vets completed an initial post-mortem on Misha, the aardvark; they have concluded that she most likely died from smoke inhalation whilst asleep in her den. ""Sadly though, after a thorough search of the site, we must presume that our four meerkats - brothers Robbie, Norman, Billy and Nigel - have died. ""We've been overwhelmed by the hundreds of emails, phone calls and letters of support from all over the country - these kind and generous messages range from families offering to give up their Christmas Day to help us clean up, to offers from local builders to rebuild the enclosures for us.""
