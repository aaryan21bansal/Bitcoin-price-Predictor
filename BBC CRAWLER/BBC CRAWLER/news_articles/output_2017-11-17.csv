"Chancellor 'to target housing and NHS'Philip Hammond will use the budget to ""attack problems"" that lost the Tories votes, a former minister tells Newsnight.3m3 minutes agoUK Politics","This video can not be played Stephen Hammond: Money in Budget 'for housing and health' Chancellor Philip Hammond plans to use ""headroom"" in the public finances to target spending on housing and health, a close friend has told the BBC. Stephen Hammond - a former transport minister - said the chancellor wants to use next Wednesday's Budget to ""attack problems"" that contributed to the Tories' poor election performance. The chancellor said in March he had ""headroom"" - available cash - of Â£26bn. Labour says he needs to tackle what it calls the squeeze in living standards. The chancellor will lay out the government's financial plans on 22 November. He is alsoexpected to call for evidence on whether a tax on the use of the most environmentally damaging single-use plastics, such as takeaway boxes and bubble wrap, would help tackle to problem of plastic waste. The Â£26bn was dubbed a ""war chest"" - designed to help him navigate the economy through Brexit. Stephen Hammond, who has known the chancellor for more than 20 years, told BBC Two's Newsnight that the chancellor was planning to use the Budget to reach out to voters who had abandoned the Tories. The party lost its overall parliamentary majority in June's election, with voters in every age group up to their late 40s preferring Labour. Housing was cited as a key concern by younger voters. Kamal Ahmed: Hammond's new Budget headache The Budget: What we know already Stephen Hammond told Newsnight: ""I think what the chancellor will be doing is saying, 'Look it would be silly to throw away all the good work we've done in getting down the deficit level, we're about to turn the corner on debt but yes of course I am listening. ""'In my autumn statement I created some headroom... and I will be looking at what... ways that headroom could be used to attack the problems that so many people have spoken to me about.'"" The former transport minister predicted a strong focus on housing in the Budget. ""I am absolutely convinced that he'll be looking at some housing ideas. ""And there are some really creative ones about looking at loan guarantees for small builders and things in that sort of area. But also he knows that we need to build more social housing and affordable housing. I think he'll be looking at ways he can encourage that."" Nick Boles, a former housing minister, told Newsnight the Conservatives would be writing themselves out of the election script unless they do more to help people without mortgages. The Financial Times reported last month that about two-thirds of the chancellor's ""war chest"" may have been wiped out in light of what Treasury officials described as a ""bloodbath"" in the public finances. The warnings came on the eve of a report by the Office for Budget Responsibility highlighting poor productivity. Amid this background, Stephen Hammond predicted that the chancellor would not abandon his reputation as a cautious figure. He said the chancellor would not deviate from his fiscal rule which is to reduce the budget deficit to below 2% of national income by 2020-21. The former minister said: ""It's a bit like running a marathon getting to the last half mile and saying, oh hell - I'll turn round and go back to the start. Philip isn't going to do that. ""It would be absolutely madness to give up on getting the economy and the finances back into a good shape."" Anneliese Dodds, the shadow financial secretary to the Treasury, said the chancellor should outline ambitious plans to tackle income inequality. A government source said the chancellor would adopt a balanced approach on his Budget.

George Bush Snr accused by interpreterAn interpreter speaking to the BBC claims the former US president groped her at a meeting in 2004.8h8 hours agoUS & Canada,"An interpreter, second left, says Mr Bush, centre, groped her in 2004 An eighth woman has come forward with claims that former US president George HW Bush groped her. An interpreter, whom the BBC has agreed not to name because of the sensitive nature of her job, claims Mr Bush touched her inappropriately in 2004. The alleged incident took place at a meeting between the former president and the Spanish defence minister Jose Bono Martinez. The interpreter has not previously spoken publicly about the incident. George Bush Snr 'groped 16-year-old girl' during 2003 photo op ""It was 2004,"" she told the BBC. ""Spanish troops had been withdrawn suddenly from Iraq and I was working as an interpreter in Spain."" Jose Zapatero's Socialist Party unexpectedly won the general election in March of that year. The incumbent US president, George W Bush, was nearing the end of his first term in office. His relationship with Mr Zapatero was markedly frostier than the warm rapport he had enjoyed with the Spanish prime minister's conservative predecessor. George HW Bush, the president's father, was hunting in Spain so, with an interpreter, Mr Martinez was sent to meet him armed with a gift - a pair of hunting rifles. The interpreter would not disclose the contents of the meeting, citing confidentiality concerns. Butmedia reports,externalsuggest Mr Martinez was hoping to enlist Mr Bush's help in establishing greater communication between the US president and the Spanish prime minister. It was at the photo call after the meeting had finished when the alleged incident occurred. ""When the time came to take the photos, Mr Bush insisted on me being in the photo,"" the interpreter said. ""I remember thinking this was odd. Usually we stay outside of the frame. ""He grabbed my bum. At first I thought it was an accident, but then he did it a second time."" Roslyn Corrigan said: ""He dropped his hands down to my buttocks and gave it a nice, ripe squeeze"" Her story is similar to other allegations made against Mr Bush. Another woman, Roslyn Corrigan,told the publication Time,externalthat Mr Bush touched her inappropriately in 2003, when she was 16. On Thursday,CNN reported allegations,externalfrom a 55-year-old woman who said Mr Bush touched her inappropriately in April 1992.

Mr McGrath partially blamed Mr Bush's use of a wheelchair. ""His arms fall on the lower waist of people with whom he takes pictures,"" he said. The interpreter told the BBC that Mr Bush was standing during the alleged incident. Mr Bush did not start using a wheelchair until around 2012, roughly eight years after the interpreter says the incident took place. ""He was not in a wheelchair at the time. We were standing in front of a fireplace,"" she said. ""I was angry more than upset, but I couldn't say anything in the circumstances. I remember thinking at the time, that he's doing this because he knows I can't say anything.

George HW Bush, pictured walking with his wife Barbara in 2004 Though she had experienced sexual harassment both before and after the incident, it remains the only time she has experienced it at the hands of a politician.

Zimbabwe ruling party urges Mugabe to quit,"Mr Mugabe made his first public appearance since the takeover on Friday Regional branches of Zimbabwe's ruling Zanu-PF party have joined growing calls for President Robert Mugabe to resign. The move comes ahead of a protest march to be held in the capital Harare on Saturday, fully supported by the country's military which staged a takeover on Wednesday. War veterans until recently loyal to the 93-year-old president and liberal groups have also urged him to quit. Earlier Mr Mugabe made his first public appearance since the takeover. Mr Mugabe had been under house arrest for days, but attended a graduation ceremony on Friday, handing out degrees. The army made its move after a power struggle over his successor. Mr Mugabe sacked Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa last week, apparently to pave the way for his wife Grace Mugabe - who is four decades younger than him - to take over the presidency instead. The military said it was ""engaging"" with Mr Mugabe and would advise the public on the outcome of talks ""as soon as possible"". Why Mugabe still commands respect Five things you should know At least eight out of 10 regional party branches voted on Friday evening for Mr Mugabe to resign as president and party secretary. In an unprecedented broadcast, several regional leaders appeared on state TV saying that he should quit. They also called for Grace Mugabe to resign from the party, and for Mr Mnangagwa to be reinstated in the party's central committee. The party's members agreed to mobilise support for and attend Saturday's rally. The party is planning to hold a special central committee session over the weekend to discuss the crisis. Meanwhile in a statement issued on Friday evening,the Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF) said it had been approached by organisers of the rally,,externalwhich it described as a ""solidarity march"". The statement went on: ""ZDF is therefore advising the nation that for as long as the planned march remains orderly, peaceful... and without hate speech and incitement to cause violence, it fully supports the march."" The war veterans used to be loyal supporters of the president Earlier Christopher Mutsvangwa - the leader of the influential war veterans' association, once loyal to Mr Mugabe - called for a huge turnout at the rally. ""We want to restore our pride and tomorrow is the day... we can finish the job which the army started,"" he said. ""There's no going back about Mugabe. He must leave."" Liberal groups opposed to the president have also backed the protest. The leader of last year's #Thisflag protests, Evans Mwarire, urged people to turn up.,external Mr Mugabe's attendance at the graduation is an annual tradition but he was not expected this year. BBC Online Africa editor Joseph Winter says the president was allowed to be there partly to keep up the pretence that the military have not staged a coup and partly because of a genuine, deeply felt respect for him going back more than 40 years. This video can not be played Mr Mugabe wore blue and yellow robes and a mortarboard hat Mr Mugabe opened the ceremony at Zimbabwe's Open University, where he is chancellor. One of the people he conferred a degree upon was Marry Chiwenga, the wife of the general who detained him on Wednesday, the state broadcaster reports. Grace Mugabe was not present. It had been thought she had left the country but it emerged on Thursday that she was at home with Mr Mugabe. The polarising Grace Mugabe Robert Mugabe - hero or villain? Soldiers seized the headquarters of Zimbabwe's national broadcaster ZBC on Wednesday and loud explosions and gunfire were heard. Major General Sibusiso Moyo then read out a statement on national television, assuring the nation that President Mugabe and his family were safe. This video can not be played Zimbabweans react to the news that troops had taken control The military was only targeting what he called ""criminals"" around the president, he said, denying that there had been a coup. On Thursday Mr Mugabe was pictured smiling as he took part in talks with an army general and South African government ministers at State House but sources suggested he might be resisting pressure to resign. Zimbabwe latest: What we know so far How can you tell a coup is happening? Zimbabwe media slow to cover takeover US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urged a quick return to civilian rule, but also said the crisis was an opportunity for Zimbabwe to set itself on a new path Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Beijing was hoping for stability and a peaceful ""appropriate"" resolution UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson warned against a transition from ""one unelected tyrant"" to another Botswana's President Ian Khama said regional leaders did not support Mr Mugabe staying in power Alpha Conde, the chairman of the African Union, a key regional bloc, said the takeover ""seems like a coup"" and demanded a return to constitutional order By Stanley Kwenda, BBC News, Kutama To get to President Mugabe's rural home you drive along the Robert Mugabe highway. It's probably one of the best maintained roads in Zimbabwe, like driving on a carpet. Along the way you are greeted by a plaque erected in his honour. Kutama is a small and tightly connected village where everyone knows each other. You can't really tell if they've been rattled by the current political crisis. As we arrived there was an air of uncertainty. Mr Mugabe is respected here - to many he's a father and a friend. A 65-year-old neighbour of his told me: ""He's kind, he's a good man and he understands people's plight."" The man goes to St Francis Xavier Roman Catholic Church with Mr Mugabe, a devout Christian, whenever he visits. ""He never demands special treatment. He visits people to check on their welfare,"" said the man at his compound. He said he supports the move by the army saying it's meant to correct a broken system. ""If his term goes out then there's nothing wrong,"" he said.

Pupil 'winked' before stabbing teacher,"One of the key issues for the inquest is why none of the other children reported what they had been told A teenager winked and smiled at a fellow pupil before he stabbed a teacher to death in her classroom in Leeds, an inquest has heard. Will Cornick showed the boy a kitchen knife just before he killed Ann Maguire at Corpus Christi Catholic College, Wakefield Coroner's Court heard. Mrs Maguire was stabbed seven times by the 15-year-old in April 2014. In a statement the boy said Cornick asked if he wanted to touch the blade. He said Cornick got the large knife out of his bag and asked ""if I wanted to see how sharp it was"". More stories from around Yorkshire In a statement, he said the 15-year-old tried to hide the knife up his sleeve but said it was ""too visible, too obvious"" and changed his mind. The teenager explained that he and Cornick were working in the room next to Mrs Maguire just before the incident. Will Cornick was jailed for life for Ann Maguire's murder in April 2014 and was told he must serve a minimum of 20 years He said then Cornick ""just winked and smiled at me as he left the room"". The boy said he then heard noises next door but said he was ""in shock"" and did not immediately report that Cornick had a knife. ""I did not really know what to do,"" he said. ""I know I should have told someone, but in the room I was in there weren't any teachers supervising us."" The jury heard how Cornick told a number of children on the morning of the tragedy what he planned to do to Mrs Maguire and two other teachers. Nick Armstrong, the barrister representing Mrs Maguire's husband and their four children, has said how one of the key issues for the inquest is why none of these children reported what they had been told. Cornick, who was 15 years old at the time of the incident, admitted murdering Mrs Maguire. He was jailed for life and ordered to serve a minimum of 20 years in custody.

Jamie Oliver bans teen daughter's selfies,"TV chef Jamie Oliver has said he has banned his 14-year-old daughter from sharing selfies, describing them as the unhealthy ""sugar of social media"". ""We ban Daisy from doing selfies and mainly she doesn't, but a couple slip up,"" the father-of-five told theLifestyle News Hound,externalpodcast. Oliver, 42, says he is among the first generation of parents learning to deal with children sharing photos online. He and wife Jools regularly post family photos on their own Instagram pages. But Oliver, a prominent campaigner for healthy eating, described teenage girls' use of Instagram as ""frightening"". He said: ""I'm going to generalise massively here, but from my observation so far, at 13 to 14, the kind of pictures that girls are putting up, just from what I've seen, split off 50:50. ""[There's] normal young girl, and then this weird hybrid of - dare I say it - quite porno sort of luscious kind of pouty lips, sort of pushing boobs out."" He said he did not ""even want to look"" at photos of other girls that 14-year-old Daisy had shown him. ""I'm like really? Are their parents not over that like a rash?"" However,Jamie,externalandJools Oliver,externalare not against Instagram itself - and frequently post snaps of family holidays and days out that they are happy to share with the public.

US Navy says its pilot drew penis in sky,"The Navy aircraft involved was an EA-18G Growler US Navy officials have said it was ""absolutely unacceptable"" that one of their pilots used a jet's contrail to draw a penis in the sky. The phallic outline over Okanogan County in the western US state of Washington provoked much mirth online. But commanders at Naval Air Station Whidbey Island did not see the funny side and have ordered an inquiry. A spokesman for the airbase confirmed that the aircraft involved was one of its Boeing EA-18G Growlers. WARNING: Some viewers may find images below offensive. The jet specialises in electronic warfare and can travel at nearly twice the speed of sound. Spokesman Thomas Mills told the BBC: ""From a Navy standpoint, we do hold our aircrew to the highest standards and this is absolutely unacceptable. ""It has zero training value and the aircrew is being held accountable."" The Federal Aviation Administration, a government agency that regulates US airspace,told local TV station KREM 2,externalthat the manoeuvre did not appear to pose a safety risk and they ""cannot police morality"".

The degrees that make you rich... and the ones that don't,"Hundreds of thousands of young people are in the process of applying to university, in time for a 2018 start. Their choices can make a huge difference to future earnings. For most university graduates, having a degree pays. Over the course of a lifetime, estimates suggest women can expect toearn about Â£250,000 moreif they have a degree, while the figure is roughly Â£170,000 for men. In England, higher tuition fees mean that, on average, students graduate withdebts of more than Â£50,000- much more than their counterparts inScotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. But repayments are only one of many factors which affect how much money graduates will have in their pockets in years to come. Perhaps unsurprisingly, there arebig differences in the earnings of graduates from different universities,external. Five years after graduation, average annual earnings for students who were taught at the London School of Economics, Imperial College London and University of Oxford are more than Â£40,000. Graduates ofthe 24 Russell Group universities,externalearn an average of Â£33,500 after five years - about 40% more than those who studied at other universities. At the other end of the scale, there are several institutions - many of them dance and drama colleges - where average earnings after five years are closer to Â£15,000. Importantly, many of the differences here are not down to the universities themselves. They have different average earnings partly because students aren't all the same - they have different abilities and interests. Entrants to Oxford, LSE and Russell Group universities start their degrees, on average, with better exam grades, for example. The big decision about what to study at university can be very important for future earnings. Five years after graduation, the income gap between students who studied the subjects that attract the highest and lowest salaries can be considerable. Graduates of medicine and dentistry earn an average of Â£46,700, while those who studied economics take home Â£40,000. These figures are about double the average wages of creative arts (Â£20,100), agriculture (Â£22,000) and mass communication (Â£22,300) graduates. Crucially, these differences are smaller, but remain significant, even when students with similar A-level grades are compared. As careers progress the gaps get bigger, with graduates of the high-earning subjects pulling even further away. For example, students of law, economics and management subjects at the London School of Economics do extremely well, with 10% of male graduates earning more than Â£300,000 by the time they are in their early 30s. A number of factors influence graduate earnings long before they get as far as choosing which course to study, or which university to attend. In particular, the reality is that male graduates earn more than female graduates. The gap can already be seen only one year after graduation, when men earn an average of Â£1,500 (8%) more than women per year. After five years, the gap has increased to around Â£3,500, or 14%. This is likely to continue to increase with age, but it should be noted that this gap is less than half that experienced by non-graduates. Some - but by no means all - of this difference can be explained by differences in subject choices, with women more likely to choose courses with low earnings potential. For example, creative arts, nursing, psychology and social science all have far more female than male students, while the opposite is true for architecture, computing and engineering. However, a large part of this difference cannot be explained away by personal choice. The social background of students also matters. Those from better off households are much more likely to go to university. They are also much more likely to go to more selective universities. That is a large part of the reason why male graduates from households with incomes above Â£50,000 earn about 20% (Â£7,000) more than their university peers from lower income households, by the time they are in their early 30s. Among women, there is a 16% (Â£4,000) gap between these households. Remarkably though, even when comparing students who did the same subject at the same university, those from the richest households still earn around 10% more than their peers from less affluent backgrounds. This suggests improving access to university alone is not enough to address issues of social mobility. 10 charts that show the effect of tuition fees Students say university 'poor value' Will doing a degree land you a career? The Oxford college with a 90% state school intake The increase in tuition fees to Â£9,250 per year in England has significantly increased the level of debt students graduate with - and the repayments many will make over their careers. Most will in fact not pay back all of the cost of their tuition, with the taxpayer picking up the difference. Recent changes have offered some respite to those who go on to have low earnings. Graduates only ever have to pay 9% of their income above a given threshold, regardless of the size of their debts. The threshold will rise from Â£21,000 to Â£25,000 in April 2018, putting more money in the pockets of significant numbers of graduates. Over the course of their working lives,this could save graduates up to Â£15,700in student loan repayments. It also means that more than 40% of graduates are now expected to repay less than they would have had there been no changes to the student loan system since 2011. And, for eight out of 10 graduates, it is likely that they will get to the end of their working lives having never paid off that loan.

Zimbabwe military backs anti-Mugabe march,"Mr Mugabe made his first public appearance since the takeover on Friday Regional branches of Zimbabwe's ruling Zanu-PF party have joined growing calls for President Robert Mugabe to resign. The move comes ahead of a protest march to be held in the capital Harare on Saturday, fully supported by the country's military which staged a takeover on Wednesday. War veterans until recently loyal to the 93-year-old president and liberal groups have also urged him to quit. Earlier Mr Mugabe made his first public appearance since the takeover. Mr Mugabe had been under house arrest for days, but attended a graduation ceremony on Friday, handing out degrees. The army made its move after a power struggle over his successor. Mr Mugabe sacked Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa last week, apparently to pave the way for his wife Grace Mugabe - who is four decades younger than him - to take over the presidency instead. The military said it was ""engaging"" with Mr Mugabe and would advise the public on the outcome of talks ""as soon as possible"". Why Mugabe still commands respect Five things you should know At least eight out of 10 regional party branches voted on Friday evening for Mr Mugabe to resign as president and party secretary. In an unprecedented broadcast, several regional leaders appeared on state TV saying that he should quit. They also called for Grace Mugabe to resign from the party, and for Mr Mnangagwa to be reinstated in the party's central committee. The party's members agreed to mobilise support for and attend Saturday's rally. The party is planning to hold a special central committee session over the weekend to discuss the crisis. Meanwhile in a statement issued on Friday evening,the Zimbabwe Defence Forces (ZDF) said it had been approached by organisers of the rally,,externalwhich it described as a ""solidarity march"". The statement went on: ""ZDF is therefore advising the nation that for as long as the planned march remains orderly, peaceful... and without hate speech and incitement to cause violence, it fully supports the march."" The war veterans used to be loyal supporters of the president Earlier Christopher Mutsvangwa - the leader of the influential war veterans' association, once loyal to Mr Mugabe - called for a huge turnout at the rally. ""We want to restore our pride and tomorrow is the day... we can finish the job which the army started,"" he said. ""There's no going back about Mugabe. He must leave."" Liberal groups opposed to the president have also backed the protest. The leader of last year's #Thisflag protests, Evans Mwarire, urged people to turn up.,external Mr Mugabe's attendance at the graduation is an annual tradition but he was not expected this year. BBC Online Africa editor Joseph Winter says the president was allowed to be there partly to keep up the pretence that the military have not staged a coup and partly because of a genuine, deeply felt respect for him going back more than 40 years. This video can not be played Mr Mugabe wore blue and yellow robes and a mortarboard hat Mr Mugabe opened the ceremony at Zimbabwe's Open University, where he is chancellor. One of the people he conferred a degree upon was Marry Chiwenga, the wife of the general who detained him on Wednesday, the state broadcaster reports. Grace Mugabe was not present.

Dad guilty of murdering son and daughter,"Saros and Leanor Endris were killed in October last year A father has been found guilty of murdering his two young children who he smothered with a petrol-soaked rag before setting fire to the family home. Saros Endris, eight, and his sister Leanor, six, were found dead at their house in Birmingham in October 2016. Their father Endris Mohammed, 47, also tried to kill his wife by attempting to cause a gas explosion. Paying tribute to her children, Penil Teklehaimanot, Mohammed's wife, said they had brought joy to her life. She said their deaths had ""had a profound effect and changed my life forever"". This video can not be played Birmingham father who killed children captured on CCTV Midlands Live: Rough sleepers could get Â£1,000 fine; Headbutted paramedic 'shaken' by attack A two-week trial at Birmingham Crown Court was told Mohammedappeared normalin the run-up to the deaths. He was found guilty of two counts of murder and one of attempted murder after the jury deliberated for under 30 minutes. Mrs Teklehaimanot said in evidence that she was woken by a smoke alarm at her home in Holland Road, Great Barr and initially thought her children were asleep when she was unable to wake them. Mohammed had denied the murders, claiming diminished responsibility allegedly caused by a depressive disorder. Police said he was found sitting in his car in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, with severe burns after setting fire to himself (some may find the picture below distressing). The court heard Mohammed told a psychiatrist he intended to take his own life and had smothered the children after becoming depressed and deciding they ""would be better off dead"". However, Det Insp Justin Spanner, of West Midlands Police, said there was no previous history of mental illness. ""As part of our investigation we spoke to people who were in his taxi on that day and they say he was happy, chatting and he seemed very normal,"" he said. Mohammed will be sentenced on Monday. Endris Mohammed suffered burns when he set his car on fire Trial judge Mr Justice Gilbart, addressing the jurors after the verdicts, told them: ""You've just dealt with a very important case. ""It's an important public service. You've earned the thanks of the public for the vital work you've done."" Paying tribute to the children, Mrs Teklehaimanot said: ""They seem too full of life and all the promise of things to come. Their futures stretched out before them - like a book waiting to be read."" She added that Saros ""was the most polite well-mannered child"", while Leanor ""was a wonderful, mature girl"". Jurors were told Mohammed carried out the killings during a ""sleepover"" in the lounge Mrs Teklehaimanot said the pair met in 2006 in Kent, after they both came to Britain from East Africa as asylum seekers. She told the court he was a ""gentle, quiet man"" and his personality had not changed in any way since 2006. Mohammed did not give evidence during his defence case but argued through his legal team that he was depressed about his future amid money worries. Jurors heard Mohammed, who was an Uber driver, claimed he had decided to end his own life because his ""hopes for a good life in England"" had failed. He told police in a statement handed to officers in January that he had no money. Mrs Teklehaimanot told the court she was not in debt and that the couple's rent payments were not in arrears.

Grammar school row head resigns,"Head teacher Aydin ÃnaÃ§ has now resigned The head of a grammar school at the centre of a row about pupils being forced to leave before their A-levels has resigned. Aydin ÃnaÃ§, headmaster of St Olave's Grammar School in Orpington, south-east London, will leave his post at Christmas, a letter to parents said. Mr ÃnaÃ§ was suspended by the school's governing body last month. Parents began legal action over the A-level exclusions but the school later backed down and let the pupils return. St Olave's is one of England's top-performing grammar schools, with pupils selected on academic ability. In September, a group of sixth-formers who did not get high enough grades at AS-level were told they would not be allowed to return to do their A-levels. In the letter to parents, sent late on Friday afternoon, acting head Andrew Rees said the headmaster was departing for ""personal reasons"". ""He leaves, with great sadness, a school which is now regarded as one of the nation's most outstanding schools and one in which parents and pupils can have great pride and confidence. ""Mr ÃnaÃ§ would like to thank all those governors, staff, parents and students who have supported him over the last seven years and extends his very best wishes to them for the future."" Parent Andrew Gebbett, who has two sons at the school, expressed relief at Mr ÃnaÃ§'s decision to leave. ""The school can now move on,"" he said. St Olave's was at the centre of a controversy over pupils being removed from the school before A-levels Debbie Hills, chair of the school's parents' association, who remained in post despite her son deciding to leave after being among those excluded, described the resignation as ""a first step to it being put right"". ""It's been a long fight."" The parents' association first sought Mr ÃnaÃ§'s resignation at a meeting in September. Another parent in a similar position said: ""There will be a lot of people who will be breaking open bottles of champagne tonight."" The parent, who asked not to be named, said it was appropriate that the school's motto was ""'to right the wrong' - and that's what's been done"". Tony Wright-Jones, a parent and former governor of the school, said: ""We want to know as parents and governors what exactly went on"". This year's A-level results at St Olave's saw 75% of all grades being awarded at A* or A and 96% were at A* to B grades, far above the national average.

Benefits claimants underpaid millions,"This video can not be played ESA claimant Peter Cartwright: 'People need this money to live' Mistakes in paying out benefits claims could cost up to Â£500m to put right, the BBC has learned. The errors identified by the Department for Work and Pensions affect the main sickness benefit, the Employment and Support Allowance (ESA). The BBC understands that assessors wrongly calculated the income of around 75,000 claimants. Ministers say that they are aware of the problem and that repayments have begun to be made. The department, which says it discovered the mistakes last December, is understood to have contacted about 1,000 people so far. It says it is still trying to understand the scale of the problems with ESA, which is paid to about 2.5 million people, and will contact anyone affected. This video can not be played Mr Field said people had been 'wrongly impoverished' as a result of the errors Frank Field, chairman of the Commons work and pensions select committee, said the problem was on a scale of ""historic proportions"". He said: ""I'm still gobsmacked at the size and the nature and the extent and the coverage of people that have been wrongly impoverished by the department getting it wrong."" The BBC understands that the errors affected people who applied for ESA between 2011/12 and 2014/15 - claimants after that date are understood to have had their benefit correctly assessed. On top of money to be paid back, the Treasury will have to pay for the staffing and processing of repayments. This extraordinary error is the latest problem to beset a troubled benefit. When Labour introduced ESA in 2008, they claimed the change would move a million people off sickness benefit and save the Treasury Â£7bn. The coalition embraced the benefit with open arms, again hoping to save money by moving people off incapacity benefit and onto ESA faster than planned. Little has changed. Back in 2006/07, 2.7 million people were receiving the main sickness benefit at a cost of Â£12bn. In this financial year, ministers estimate 2.4 million people will get ESA - at a cost of Â£15bn. For claimants, the changes have meant undergoing health assessments to prove their illnesses, which some say has created stress and anxiety. Mistakes began in 2011 when the government started moving benefits recipients onto ESA - which is paid to those with long-term health conditions that are not going to improve. ESA wasintroduced by the Labour government in 2008to replace incapacity benefit. At the time of that migration, an independent expert working for the Department for Work and Pensions, Professor Malcolm Harrington, urged ministers not to proceed until he was certain the system was robust. The department said it only became aware of the problem in December 2016 after the Office for National Statistics published fraud and error figures for the social security system. Peter Cartwright, who was one of those moved from incapacity benefit to ESA due to mental and physical health problems, said the errors were ""disgusting"". ""People need this money to live,"" said Mr Cartwright, who does not yet know if he was underpaid. ""It's not as if you can go and get loads of luxuries when you're on this benefit."" The 54-year-old from County Durham said people on benefits often had to make the choice between food and heating, adding: ""If people are getting underpaid that means they're not getting through."" The DWP said it was ""currently reviewing the historical benefit payments of claimants"" Many of those eligible for ESA may also need to apply for universal credit - a benefit for people with a health condition or disability which prevents them from working. Universal credit is alreadyexperiencing its own problems- with reports of IT issues, overspending and administrative errors. Successful applicants for ESA are paid the benefit either on the basis of having made enough National Insurance claims, or because they are on a low income. In calculating how much income a claimant is entitled to, benefit assessors have to work through a variety of factors, such as what other benefits someone might be on, how much they earn from any work or whether there is any other income coming into the household. In a statement, the Department for Work and Pensions, said it was aware of the issue and ""currently reviewing the historical benefit payments of claimants"".

First female Black Rod in 650 years,"Sarah Clarke is championship director of the All England Lawn Tennis Club Black Rod - a Parliamentary role that can trace its origins back 650 years - is to be a woman for the first time. Sarah Clarke is currently in charge of organising the Wimbledon tennis championships. She will be known as The Lady Usher of the Black Rod when she starts her new job early next year. Black Rod is best known for the State Opening of Parliament, knocking on the door of the House of Commons to summon MPs for the Queen's Speech. As well as organising ceremonial events, Black Rod, who can earn up to Â£93,000 a year, manages a team of 30 staff involved in the day-to-day running of the House of Lords. Ms Clarke, who has previously worked in senior roles at four Olympic Games, the London Marathon and UK Sport, replaces current Black Rod, David Leakey, who is retiring. She said: ""I am both deeply honoured and delighted to be invited to take up the role of Black Rod."" Black Rod is best known for summoning MPs to hear the Queen's Speech She said the House of Lords was ""a place where the smallest detail is as important as the big picture and the depth of heritage and tradition is second to none,"" adding: ""I am truly looking forward to starting work."" Lord Fowler, who as the Speaker of the House of Lords advised the Queen on the appointment, said it was an ""historic moment"". He said Black Rod played an important role behind the scenes ""in organising addresses to Parliament by visiting heads of state and other state events, as well as ensuring we have appropriate plans in place to keep the important work of the Lords going in a crisis"". He added: ""Sarah's fantastic record at Wimbledon and elsewhere shows she is the right person for the task."" Current Black Rod David Leakey is retiring Black Rod summons MPs to the Lords to hear the Queen's Speech but has the door to the House of Commons slammed in his face, and has to knock three times to gain entry. He is the monarch's representative in the House of Lords and the routine is symbolic of the House of Commons' independence from the Crown.

N Korea defector has 'enormous parasites',"Parasites like tapeworms (file pic) can live inside people's digestive tracts A North Korean soldier who was shot while fleeing across the border has an extremely high level of parasites in his intestines, his doctors say. The defector crossed the demilitarised zone on Monday, but was shot several times by North Korean border guards. Doctors say the patient is stable - but ""an enormous number"" of worms in his body are contaminating his wounds and making his situation worse. His condition is thought to give a rare insight into life in North Korea. ""I've never seen anything like this in my 20 years as a physician,"" South Korean doctor Lee Cook-jong told journalists, explaining that the longest worm removed from the patient's intestines was 27cm (11in) long. ""North Korea is a very poor country and like any other poor country it has serious health problems,"" Prof Andrei Lankov of Kookmin University in Seoul told the BBC. ""North Korea does not have the resources to have a modern medical system,"" he says. ""Its doctors are relatively poorly trained and have to work with primitive equipment."" In 2015 South Korean researchers studied the health records of North Korean defectors who had visited a hospital in Cheonan between 2006 and 2014. They found that they showed higher rates of chronic hepatitis B, chronic hepatitis C, tuberculosis and parasite infections, compared to South Koreans. Nine charts which tell you all you need to know about North Korea Inside the world's most secretive country What are North Korean snacks like? ""I don't know what is happening in North Korea, but I found many parasites when examining other defectors,"" Professor Seong Min of Dankook University Medical School was quoted by the Korea Biomedical Review as saying. But Prof Lankov points out that compared with other countries with a similar per capita income - like Bangladesh or many African countries - the population in North Korea is healthier than one would expect. The country's life expectancy is well above average considering the level of economic poverty, he says. The soldier was rushed to hospital on Monday Yes. Considering that he is already in a critical condition, they are making a bad situation much worse. The soldier was shot at least six times when North Korean border guards opened fire on him as he ran across the Joint Security Area in Panmunjom to the South Korean side. The young soldier was rushed by helicopter to a hospital in South Korea and has undergone emergency surgery. Doctors say there is a severe contamination of the wounds by both parasites and faeces. ""We are paying close attention to prevent possible complications,"" surgeon Lee Cook-jong told reporters, explaining that ""an enormous number of parasites"" including roundworms had been found in the small intestine. Humans can get parasites through eating contaminated food, by being bitten by an insect or by the parasite entering through the skin. In the case of the North Korean defector, the first case is most likely. Parasites which enter the body via contaminated food are often worms. The soldier's food may have been contaminated because the North still uses human faeces as fertiliser, known as ""night soil"". Lee Min-bok, a North Korean agriculture expert, told Reuters: ""Chemical fertiliser was supplied by the state until the 1970s. By the 1990s, the state could not supply it any more, so farmers started to use a lot of night soil instead."" If these faeces are untreated and fertilise vegetables that are later eaten uncooked, the parasites get into the mouth and the intestines of the person. While some don't cause any severe symptoms, others can be life-threatening, explains Prof Peter Preiser from the School of Biological Sciences at Nanyang Technological University in Singapore. ""What they all do is take nutrients away from your body,"" he told the BBC. ""So [even] if most of them might go unnoticed, they all indicate a poor health status. To put it simply: people who have parasites are not healthy."" Surgeon Lee Cook-jong said he'd never seen that many parasites If the intestines are disrupted and parasites are released into the body cavity, they can be a lot more dangerous and much more complicated to treat. Also, he is likely to have had the parasites for a long time. This means ""that patient will generally be in a weaker state so any wounds and surgery will become more dangerous,"" explains Prof Preiser. Parasites, especially worms, are thought to be widespread in North Korea. However, they also affect many developing countries where diets include uncooked vegetables fertilised with faeces. There are ways to treat faeces so they can be used as a safe fertiliser, but many poor countries neglect to do so. Prof Lankov says this seems to be the case in North Korea. The poor health and nutrition has widespread consequences ""but North Korea does not admit this because they fear this will affect their image too much"". Should there ever be a reunification of the two Koreas though, there would be massive health problems for officials to deal with for decades to come, Prof Lankov warns.

Defiant Mugabe makes public appearance,"This video can not be played Mr Mugabe wore blue and yellow robes and a mortarboard hat Zimbabwe's President Robert Mugabe has made his first public appearance since the army took over on Wednesday. He attended a graduation ceremony in the capital, Harare, handing out degrees. Mr Mugabe had been under house arrest for days. The army made its move after a power struggle over his successor. The military said on Friday it was ""engaging"" with Mr Mugabe and would advise the public on the outcome of talks ""as soon as possible"". Meanwhile Christopher Mutsvangwa - the leader of the influential war veterans' association, once loyal to Mr Mugabe - said he should step down at once. He called for a huge turnout in street protests on Saturday. Why Mugabe still commands respect Five things you should know ""We want to restore our pride and tomorrow is the day... we can finish the job which the army started,"" Mr Mutsvangwa said. ""There's no going back about Mugabe. He must leave."" Liberal groups opposed to the president have also backed the rally. The leader of last year's #Thisflag protests, Evans Mwarire, urged people to turn up.,external Mr Mugabe is chancellor at the Open University Mr Mugabe's attendance at the graduation is an annual tradition but he was not expected this year. BBC Online Africa editor Joseph Winter says he was allowed to be there partly to keep up the pretence that the military have not staged a coup and partly because of a genuine, deeply felt respect for him going back more than 40 years. Mr Mugabe walked slowly up a red carpet and joined the crowd in singing the national anthem, then opened the graduation ceremony at Zimbabwe's Open University, where he is chancellor. One of the people he conferred a degree upon was Marry Chiwenga, the wife of the general who detained him on Wednesday, the state broadcaster reports. Neither the 93-year-old president's wife, Grace Mugabe, nor Education Minister Jonathan Moyo - an ally of hers whose house was reportedly raided by the military - were present. The army acted after Mr Mugabe sacked Vice-President Emmerson Mnangagwa last week. Mr Mnangagwa was seen as a potential successor and his sacking was supposed to have paved the way for Grace Mugabe - who is four decades younger than him - to take over the presidency instead. This video can not be played Who is Grace Mugabe? It was thought she had left the country but it emerged on Thursday that she was at home with Mr Mugabe. The polarising Grace Mugabe Robert Mugabe - hero or villain? By Stanley Kwenda, BBC News, Kutama To get to President Robert Mugabe's rural home you drive along the Robert Mugabe highway. It's probably one of the best maintained roads in Zimbabwe, like driving on a carpet. Along the way you are greeted by a plaque erected in his honour. Kutama is a small and tightly connected village where everyone knows each other. You can't really tell if they've been rattled by the current political crisis. As we arrived there was an air of uncertainty. Mr Mugabe is respected here - to many he's a father and a friend. A 65-year-old neighbour of his told me: ""He's kind, he's a good man and he understands people's plight."" The man goes to St Francis Xavier Roman Catholic Church with Mr Mugabe, a devout Christian, whenever he visits. ""He never demands special treatment. He visits people to check on their welfare,"" said the man at his compound. He said he supports the move by the army saying it's meant to correct a broken system. ""If his term goes out then there's nothing wrong,"" he said. Military vehicles were spotted on roads leading to the Zimbabwean capital Harare on Tuesday, sparking rumours that something was afoot. Later, soldiers seized the headquarters of Zimbabwe's national broadcaster ZBC and loud explosions and gunfire were heard. Major General Sibusiso Moyo then read out a statement on national television, assuring the nation that President Mugabe and his family were safe. The military was only targeting what he called ""criminals"" around the president, he said, denying that there had been a coup. On Thursday Mr Mugabe was pictured smiling as he took part in talks with an army general and South African government ministers at State House but sources suggested he might be resisting pressure to resign. Zimbabwe latest: What we know so far How can you tell a coup is happening? Zimbabwe media slow to cover takeover Zimbabweans have been posting on Facebook and Twitter that there has been no dramatic effect on normal life. People say that shops have opened as normal but there are few people on the streets of the capital. Some Zimbabweans spoken to by the BBC have welcomed the news, with one man expressing his thanks to the army for ""taking out the tyrant"". This video can not be played Zimbabweans react to the news that troops had taken control US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urged a quick return to civilian rule, but also said the crisis was an opportunity for Zimbabwe to set itself on a new path that includes democratic elections and respect for human rights Chinese foreign ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said Beijing was hoping for stability and a peaceful ""appropriate"" resolution UK Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson said he hoped things would improve but also warned against a transition from ""one unelected tyrant"" to another Botswana's President Ian Khama told Reuters news agency that regional leaders did not support Mr Mugabe staying in power, adding: ""We are presidents, we are not monarchs"" Alpha Conde, the chairman of the African Union, a key regional bloc, said the takeover ""seems like a coup"" and demanded a return to constitutional order Reality Check: Zimbabwe's false rumours The polarising Grace Mugabe Key players in Zimbabwe crisis Five things about Zimbabwe crisis What next for Robert and Grace Mugabe?

First female Black Rod in 650 yearsBoss of the Wimbledon tennis championships Sarah Clarke gets ancient Parliamentary job.,"Sarah Clarke is championship director of the All England Lawn Tennis Club Black Rod - a Parliamentary role that can trace its origins back 650 years - is to be a woman for the first time. Sarah Clarke is currently in charge of organising the Wimbledon tennis championships. She will be known as The Lady Usher of the Black Rod when she starts her new job early next year. Black Rod is best known for the State Opening of Parliament, knocking on the door of the House of Commons to summon MPs for the Queen's Speech. As well as organising ceremonial events, Black Rod, who can earn up to Â£93,000 a year, manages a team of 30 staff involved in the day-to-day running of the House of Lords. Ms Clarke, who has previously worked in senior roles at four Olympic Games, the London Marathon and UK Sport, replaces current Black Rod, David Leakey, who is retiring. She said: ""I am both deeply honoured and delighted to be invited to take up the role of Black Rod."" Black Rod is best known for summoning MPs to hear the Queen's Speech She said the House of Lords was ""a place where the smallest detail is as important as the big picture and the depth of heritage and tradition is second to none,"" adding: ""I am truly looking forward to starting work."" Lord Fowler, who as the Speaker of the House of Lords advised the Queen on the appointment, said it was an ""historic moment"". He said Black Rod played an important role behind the scenes ""in organising addresses to Parliament by visiting heads of state and other state events, as well as ensuring we have appropriate plans in place to keep the important work of the Lords going in a crisis"". He added: ""Sarah's fantastic record at Wimbledon and elsewhere shows she is the right person for the task."" Current Black Rod David Leakey is retiring Black Rod summons MPs to the Lords to hear the Queen's Speech but has the door to the House of Commons slammed in his face, and has to knock three times to gain entry. He is the monarch's representative in the House of Lords and the routine is symbolic of the House of Commons' independence from the Crown. The earliest known reference to the role of Black Rod as the Usher to the Order of the Garter is in letters patent from 1361 - there are thought to have been 60 holders of the position since then, all men.

Illustrator cries foul over John Lewis adChris Riddell accuses the retail giant of copying one of his characters in its Christmas advert.6h6 hours agoEntertainment & Arts,"The ad features a monster called Moz and a boy named Joe John Lewis has been accused of copying a 1986 book by former Children's Laureate Chris Riddell in its latest Christmas advert. Writing on social media, the illustrator accused the retail giant of ""helping themselves"" to his book Mr Underbed in its festive campaign. Both feature a small boy who discovers a giant cuddly monster under his bed. John Lewis responded by insisting ""the main thrust"" of its advert's story was ""utterly different to Chris Riddell's"". It said: ""The story of a big hairy monster under the bed which keeps a child from sleeping is a universal tale which has been told many times over many years. ""Ours is a Christmas story of friendship and fun between Joe and Moz the Monster, in which Joe receives a night light which helps him get a good night's sleep."" Mr Underbed was originally published in 1986 Riddell's story features a small boy whose attempts to find another place for Mr Underbed to sleep lead to the discovery that he shares his bedroom with various other hidden creatures. Writing on Tumblr,externalon Thursday, Riddell said it was ""very generous of John Lewis to devote their Christmas advertising campaign to my 1986 picture book... in this age of shrinking publicity budgets"". The author and illustrator said he was not interested in ""a protracted and arcane legal action"" but was merely concerned with having ""the issue of accreditation"" highlighted. ""Going forward, it's important that young creative people have their work credited in the proper way,"" he told BBC News. Riddell's other books include the award-winning Goth Girl series The writer conceded that the advert's plot was ""different to the underlying story in Mr Underbed"" but still said he felt there were clear parallels.

Eviction threat over crying baby,"The Wurth family were told they might be evicted because their baby was crying A family renting in London have been threatened with eviction after complaints that their baby was crying. They were warned by the management firm that if the noise went on they could be given ""two weeks' notice to vacate"". The parents, with a 15-month-old daughter and a three-year-old son, say it is ""horrible discrimination"" against families renting with children. The management firm said neighbours were being disturbed by noisy children and ""other noise nuisance"". Neighbours had complained ""on a daily basis"" and the other tenants had a right not to be troubled by noise, the company said. Attila and Ildiko Wurth, with their two young children, are living in a privately rented top-floor flat in a converted house in Hammersmith, west London. They say they were shaken to receive an email from the managing agent, saying there had been a ""complaint stating that at 5.30am this morning a baby was crying and stamping and then further noise starting again at 6.45am, which woke one of the other tenants in the property"". ""We have subsequently liaised with your landlord and are instructed that we are to agree arrangements with you to vacate the property as soon as possible."" This video can not be played Attila Wurth says the family was shocked and upset by the idea of being evicted Attila says they were shocked by this ""heartless and harsh"" attitude and deeply upset by the idea of being thrown out of their home. Another email said there had been further complaints and ""if this continues we will have no choice but to issue a Section 8 notice, which will give you two weeks' notice to vacate"". The Wurths were told: ""Please ensure to keep all movement and noise to a minimum."" Uncertain about what to do next, they sought advice and were directed towards a housing helpline, which they said was always engaged. In the end it was social media that got them some support, putting their problem on to Facebook. ""We felt so scared. We didn't know what happens next. Will we come home and find our things in the road?"" Rising numbers of families are now living long-term in rented accommodation. While once couples with children might have bought their own place, more are renting into their 30s and 40s - and the case highlights the pressures facing ""generation rent"". Attila works as a vet, but says the couple can't afford to buy in London. ""We pay our own way, but we have no more to spare. ""You have to be extremely rich to have children in London,"" he says. The local authority, Hammersmith and Fulham, says that about a third of the residents in the borough are private renters. This year it extended a licensing scheme to try to give private renters more protection and to ensure their legal rights. The email to the Wurths warns of a ""Section 8"" eviction - referring to the Housing Act of 1988, which would allow a landlord to remove tenants before the end of their tenancy agreement. The housing charity Shelter says this would require grounds such as not paying rent, anti-social behaviour or a breach of the tenancy agreement. More families like the Wurths are staying in rented accommodation This could include being a ""nuisance"" to neighbours - but a court would have to decide whether such claims were reasonable. ""We have been very careful about noise,"" says Attila. But if landlords rent to a family with young children, he says, it is unrealistic to think that a baby won't cry sometimes. ""We don't even have a stereo or a TV to make noise with - and we have avoided making any noise with household activities,"" says Attila. The managing agent, Sheraton Management Ltd, says the Wurths ""were in breach of contract as they were causing disturbance to the other occupants of the building... not only relating to noisy children, but also other noise nuisance"". The agent says there had been ""banging, stamping, loud footsteps"". ""Reluctantly, as there was no remission in the problem, it was on this basis that we advised Mrs Wurth that we may be left with no alternative but to serve a notice for possession,"" it says. The management company says it has a responsibility to other tenants in the building - and to claims ""that their contractual right to quiet enjoyment has been breached"". Sheraton's statement says: ""We manage numerous properties lived in by families, some with very young children. Our policy is always to avoid the necessity for repossession proceedings."" The Wurths are waiting to hear what will happen next.

Tusk gives UK Brexit talks ultimatum,"Mr Tusk said progress on citizens' rights had not been mirrored in other areas Theresa May has been told she has two weeks to put more money on the table if the EU is to agree to begin Brexit trade talks before the end of the year. EU Council President Donald Tusk said he was ""ready"" to move onto the next phase of Brexit talks, covering future relations with the UK. But he said the UK must show much more progress on the ""divorce bill"" and the Irish border by early next month. Mrs May said ""good progress"" was being made but more needed to be done. The talks are currently deadlocked over the UK's financial settlement, citizens' rights and Ireland with Irish PM Leo Varadkar accusing the UK of not ""thinking through"" the implications of Brexit for his country. A week ago, the EU's chief negotiator Michel Barnier informed his UK counterpart David Davis he had a fortnight to spell out in more detail what he was prepared to pay the EU to ""settle its accounts"" and to clarify how trade between the Republic and Northern Ireland and security across the 310 mile border would be preserved after the UK leaves the single market and customs union. Kuenssberg: Can 'bad cop' Davis reboot talks? Adler: Parallel universes of UK and EU negotiators Reality Check: What's happening with Brexit divorce bill? Davis: EU must compromise on Brexit Irish demand post-Brexit border promise After holding talks with Mrs May on the margins of a jobs summit in Sweden, Mr Tusk repeated the message, saying ""much more"" progress was needed on these two issues if he was to recommend to EU leaders at their next meeting on 14 December to give the green light to the next phase of talks. He said he would meet Mrs May in a week's time to assess progress but warned time was running out for a breakthrough before the end of 2017. ""We will be ready to move on to the second phase already in December,"" he said. ""But in order to do that we need to see more progress from the UK side. The UK needs the approval of all 27 EU nations if it is to begin the next phase of talks ""If there is not sufficient progress by then, I will be ... not be in a position to propose new guidelines on transition and the future relationship at the December European Council....I made it very clear to the Prime Minister May that this progress needs to happen at the beginning of December at the latest."" Before leaving the event in Gothenburg, Mrs May said that the two sides had to ""work together"" to reach a point where the EU believed sufficient progress had been made to open up trade discussions. She rejected claims that the talks were in limbo and restated her priority was to talk as soon as possible about her goal of a future ""deep and special"" trade and economic partnership. ""We're clear and I'm clear that what we need to do is move forwards together,"" she said. The UK has said it will honour its existing financial obligations by ensuring no EU nation is worse off during the current budgetary period ending in 2020, a sum reported to be in the region of Â£20bn. But the EU wants the UK to go further and contribute to what they say are longer-term liabilities, such as regional development spending and pension payments for British officials working for the EU and retired staff. This video can not be played David Davis: ""Nothing comes for nothing"" in negotiations Asked whether Mrs May had to stump up more money to pave the way for trade talks, Swedish PM Stefan Lovren said Britain ""needs to clarify what they mean by their financial responsibility"". French President Emmanuel Macron said the unified position agreed by all 27 other EU members earlier this year had not changed and talks on future relations would not commence ""until the divorce has been settled"". Mr Varadkar, who also held a bilateral meeting with his British counterpart, said he was prepared to wait until next year for ""further concessions"" from the UK in a number of areas. He said he wanted binding guarantees that there would be no physical checks at the border after the UK leaves in March 2019, dismissing as inadequate verbal assurances that technological advances will help ensure the continued free and safe movement of people. ""What we want to take off the table before talking about trade is the idea that there would be any hard border, physical border, or border resembling the past in Ireland,"" said the Irish PM. ""I think it would be in all of our interests that we proceed to phase two in December,"" he added. ""But it's 18 months since the referendum. Sometimes it doesn't seem like they've thought all of this through."" Some Tory MPs believe the UK should flex its muscles and walk away from the talks unless the EU is more accommodating, arguing the EU has as much to lose as the UK from not agreeing a trade deal.

What next for Robert and Grace Mugabe?,"Robert Mugabe has led Zimbabwe for 37 years Zimbabwe's ruling Zanu-PF party is planning to support impeachment proceedings against Robert Mugabe, after he ignored a deadline to stand down as president. Zimbabweans - and many watching around the world - were astounded on Sunday night when Mr Mugabe addressed the nation and said that far from stepping down, he was going to stay on and preside over the ruling party's congress in December. So with Mr Mugabe defiant, and the army insisting that it has not carried out a a coup, what are the options for getting him to vacate his position? Here are five possible scenarios: Zanu-PF members sang and danced as they sacked Mr Mugabe as leader Zanu-PF says it will launch impeachment proceedings against Mr Mugabe when parliament convenes on Tuesday. Impeachment is the process of removing a president via parliament. Both the National Assembly and the Senate can begin proceedings to remove the president if both pass simple majority votes against him. A two-thirds majority is needed in both houses in order for impeachment to succeed. Zanu-PF has a two-thirds majority in the House of Assembly, but not the Senate. The formal process is expected to start on Tuesday but it is not clear how long it would take. The benefit of this process for the military is that it allows the generals to say the removal of the president was done in accordance with the constitution, in keeping with their statement that this is not a coup. The downside for them is that it does not guarantee that the man widely thought to be their favourite for president will get the top job straight away. People in Harare celebrated Zanu-PF sacked Robert Mugabe as their leader Emmerson Mnangagwa, whose sacking prompted the military's action, could not immediately take over from Mr Mugabe, because constitutionally it is the current vice-president who should fill the vacancy. At the moment that person is Phelekezela Mphoko - a man whose sympathies are known to lie with Grace Mugabe, and who was expelled by Zanu-PF on Sunday. Whether the army can persuade Mr Mugabe to appoint their preferred candidate as vice-president before stepping down remains to be seen. Some analysts have argued that this may be what the generals were discussing with him - and it may also be his trump card. But given how difficult it has been to get Mr Mugabe to step down, the chances of getting him to concede further ground look increasingly slim. Five things you should know about Zimbabwe This video can not be played Robert Mugabe: ""The congress is due... I will preside over its processes"" President Mugabe was defiant when he made his televised address on Sunday. Despite having been sacked by Zanu-PF, he said ""the party congress is due in a few weeks and I will preside over its processes"". He suggested that he was willing to forgive the military action, and said ""whatever the pros and cons of how they [the army] went about their operation, I, as commander-in-chief, do acknowledge their concerns"". It had been reported that Mr Mugabe had agreed to resign. It is unclear whether he changed his mind, or if these reports were incorrect. But BBC Africa editor Fergal Keane says it makes the military look weak. Some suggest that there may be grounds within Zanu-PF's own rules which might allow Mr Mugabe to reject his sacking by the party. President Mugabe is known for both being shrewd and stubborn. So he may well have another ace up his sleeve. Robert Mugabe - hero or villain? There is growing speculation over the whereabouts of Grace Mugabe Initially it had been thought that the military was trying to reach a deal which would allow President Mugabe to stay in Zimbabwe once he had stood down. But the current stalemate makes that look less likely. From the point of view of Mr Mugabe, and his wife, there is a fear that even if he were to be promised immunity from prosecution now, that could be removed by a future government. So it might mean that Mr Mugabe is forced into exile. Until recently, neighbouring South Africa would have been a natural place for him to go. Mr Mugabe enjoys a high level of respect there, in large part because of his support for the fight against apartheid rule. Indeed, the opposition EFF party has called on the government to ""prepare to welcome President Mugabe for political asylum"". Allow Twitter content?

The Mugabes are reported to have a number of properties in South Africa. The sticking point would be what happens to Grace. She was granted diplomatic immunity after allegedly assaulting a model in a hotel room in Johannesburg in August. But model Gabriella Engels is trying to get the diplomatic immunity order set aside. If successful, it would mean Mrs Mugabe could face prosecution should she go to South Africa. So if not South Africa, then where? Other possible options are Singapore and Malaysia, where the Mugabes also have properties. 'Gucci Grace' The leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change-Tsvangirai (MDC-T) party is back in Harare after receiving treatment for cancer in South Africa, fuelling speculation about negotiations for a unity government. Morgan Tsvangirai is back in Harare This is the scenario that many in the West, and of course the opposition, would prefer. Another opposition leader, Tendai Biti, has said that he would join a national unity government if Mr Tsvangirai was also in it. But the military takeover was not a change of regime. It was an internal dispute within Zanu-PF, and that party is still very much in power. The military is to a large extent the armed wing of Zanu-PF. And the man it supports as leader - Emmerson Mnangagwa - helped Robert Mugabe carry out some of his most controversial policies. Emmerson Mnangagwa is the man the military wants to take over He is also, some say, more ruthless. So it is far from clear that the ousting of Mr Mugabe would improve the lives of ordinary Zimbabweans. Zimbabwe's next president?

Kuenssberg: Davis plays 'bad cop',"This video can not be played In full: My interview with David Davis Negotiations, compromise, give and take, mutual understanding and cooperation. Not today. The Brexit secretary this morning seemed not to be up for much of that. Speaking to us in Berlin, where much of the future of the talks between the whole EU and UK will be decided, David Davis warned the other side they will get ""nothing for nothing"", and said that the UK had already done much of ""the running"". And, for good measure, he hit out at Germany and France, the ""powerful players"", who have been taking a hardline approach, in contrast to countries like Denmark, and Holland who want to move the talks on to the next phase. Davis's message: It's not me that needs to compromise, it's you, now get on with it. It is not without risk that to try to single out different countries in this way when the EU 27 have been extremely effective so far in maintaining public unity, and are absolutely determined to keep doing so. At the same time Davis was speaking to us in Germany, other EU leaders were telling Theresa May the exact opposite, repeating what has been the solid consensus across the continent that unless the UK gives a firmer and more explicit commitment to put more cash on the table the prospects for the talks are grim. The Irish PM even went as far as claiming of Brexiteers in Britain ""it's 18 months since the referendum, it's 10 years since people have wanted a referendum started agitating for one. Sometime it doesn't seem like they've thought all of this through"". While it might feel like the two sides are in completely parallel universes,as we discussed yesterday, there is an awareness in the UK that there are going to have to be further moves on the EU (Withdrawal) bill, whatever Boris Johnson may say. But alongside that, at some point, particularly Germany, along with France, will have to take a political decision as to whether the UK appears sufficiently willing. What's less clear is whether David Davis playing the bad cop today will really help broker this stage of the talks. For his critics it seems just that he is pointlessly digging in, refusing to listen to the every growing line-up of EU leaders who say it's Britain that has to budge.

Davis: EU must compromise on Brexit,"This video can not be played David Davis: ""Nothing comes for nothing"" in negotiations David Davis has said the EU must be willing to give ground too if further progress in Brexit talks is to be made. He told the BBC the UK has ""been offering some creative compromises and not always got them back"", insisting that ""nothing comes for nothing"". Many EU countries want to move on in the talks because they can see how important it is to their economies, he told political editor Laura Kuenssberg. But he said this needed support from 27 nations, including Germany and France. The EU says negotiations cannot move on to trade until questions about the UK ""divorce bill"", citizens' rights and Northern Ireland are resolved. Kuenssberg: Can 'bad cop' Davis reboot talks? Irish demand post-Brexit border promise Three things you need to know about talks Katya Adler: Parallel universes of UK and EU negotiators All you need to know about Brexit Theresa May is set to discuss Brexit with EU Council president Donald Tusk later on the margins of a jobs summit in Sweden amid growing pressure for a breakthrough before the end of the year. Downing Street has insisted an earlier meeting with Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar had been ""constructive"" despite the two countries appearing to be no closer to bridging the differences between them. Dublin wants binding guarantees there will be no return to a hard border with Northern Ireland after the UK's exit and Mr Varadkar has indicated he is prepared to ""wait for further concessions"". Arriving for the event in Gothenburg, he said the UK's verbal assurances that there would be no physical infrastructure at the border were not sufficient. Despite the smiles, Leo Varadkar and Theresa May have real differences over the Irish border ""I think it would be in all of our interests that we proceed to phase two in December,"" he said. ""But...sometimes it doesn't seem like they've thought all of this through."" UK Brexit secretary David Davis said he had already made concessions in areas such as the right of EU citizens to vote in local elections in the UK among other things. In a speech in Berlin on Thursday, he warned against ""putting politics above prosperity"" in Britain's post-Brexit relationship with the EU. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mr Davis's speech was delivered politely but implied ""pretty significant frustrations on the UK side with the EU's attitude"". The Brexit Secretary, she added, had not offered anything specific - including on what the EU regards as the vital issue of money - in his speech to ""move things on"". This video can not be played Davis: Other countries see the ""big benefit"" in future Brexit deal. Asked about reports Germany and France were standing in the way of the next phase of talks, Mr Davis said they clearly had the most influence but it was a decision for all 27 and ""many of them do want to move on"". ""It is very important to them, countries like Denmark, countries Holland, like Italy and Spain, countries like Poland can see there are big benefits in the future deal we are talking about."" He suggested there needed to be more give-and-take from the other side. ""I want them to compromise, surprise surprise, nothing comes for nothing in this world,"" he said. ""But so far, in this negotiation, we have made a lot of compromises. On the citizens' rights front, we have made all the running."" As he met his British counterpart Boris Johnson in Dublin, Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney said the two sides were ""not in place right now"" to begin talking about future relations. The Dutch are among those who want trade talks to begin, the UK has said Mr Coveney has floated the idea of a post-Brexit transition period of four or five years to allow both sides to adjust to the changes required. This would be twice as long as that envisaged by the UK government - which wants an implementation phase of around two years. Mr Johnson said while he understood the need to give maximum reassurance to businesses, he thought ""it was possible to do this within a much shorter timescale"", adding that ""we want to get on as fast as possible with the meat of the negotiations"". After a week dominated by talk of a potential Tory rebellion against attempts to fix the precise time of Brexit in the EU Withdrawal Bill, Mr Davis has suggested he will listen to concerns before it is voted on next month. Up to 20 Tory MPs are reported to be opposed to the move as they fear it could tie the hands of British negotiators if talks drag on to the last minute. Mr Davis told the BBC that setting the exact moment of Brexit - 23.00 GMT on 29th March 2019 - in law was a ""good idea"" but he would not pre-empt what ""form"" this would take. ""The whole of this bill is going to be debated through the House,"" he said. ""And there are parts which will change as we go through, undoubtedly. We'll debate it, we'll see where we go."" But No 10 suggested it would not back down, urging all MPs to support a move which it said would ""provide certainty over our position that we are leaving the EU"".

"Aircraft and helicopter in 'mid-air crash'The crash happened just after midday near Waddesdon Hall in Buckinghamshire.1ma minute agoBeds, Herts & Bucks","This video can not be played Waddesdon helicopter crash: Aerial shots show crash scene Four people have died after a plane and a helicopter crashed in mid-air over Buckinghamshire. Two people were killed in each aircraft, Thames Valley Police said. Police and the Air Accidents Investigation Branch (AAIB) said they have launched a joint investigation to establish the cause of the collision just after midday at Waddesdon Estate, near Aylesbury. A Wycombe Air Park spokesman said both aircraft came from the airfield. Supt Rebecca Mears, from Thames Valley Police, said she could not give any details of the identity or the genders of the victims at this stage and her ""first priority"" was the next of kin. She said it was ""too early to tell"" what might have caused the crash. The AAIB said the plane involved was a Cessna. Emergency services were called to Upper Winchendon, close to Waddesdon Manor, at 12:06 GMT. Emergency services were called at 12:06 GMT Mitch Missen, an off-duty firefighter, witnessed the crash from his garden. He said: ""I looked up and saw as both collided in mid-air, followed by a large bang and falling debris. ""I rushed in to get my car keys and en route called the emergency services, who I continued to give updates as to its whereabouts. ""Unfortunately, I wasn't able to locate the actual crash site but directed police, fire and ambulance as best I could. Once they were on the scene, I returned home.""

Tesla unveils first truck - and roadsterElon Musk springs a surprise with a new roadster as he launches the company's first electric truck.7h7 hours agoTechnologyComments,"This video can not be played WATCH: See the new Tesla Semi and Roadster Tesla has unveiled its first electric articulated lorry, designed to challenge diesel trucks as king of the road. The long-anticipated Tesla Semi has a range of 500 miles on a single charge. Tesla says the vehicle - known in the US as a semi-trailer truck - will go into production in 2019. Chief executive Elon Musk also unexpectedly revealed a new Roadster, which he said would be ""the fastest production car ever"" made. The red sports car was driven out of the trailer of the electric lorry during Tesla's presentation on Thursday. The Roadster will have a range of close to 1,000km (620 miles) on a single charge and will do 0-100mph in 4.2 seconds. Mr Musk described it as ""a hardcore smackdown to gasoline cars"". He said riding in traditional cars would be like driving ""a steam engine with a side of quiche"". The new Roadster becomes available in 2020. The Tesla Semi  will achieve 0-60mph in 20 seconds when pulling 36,287kgs (80,000lbs), the maximum allowed on US roads. Speaking on stage at Tesla's facility in Los Angeles, chief executive Elon Musk said: ""It's not like any truck that you've ever driven."" However, the charismatic Mr Musk faces continued pressure from investors and customers as the firm struggles to meet demand for its Model 3 car. The Model 3 is behind schedule due to factory delays, a situation Mr Musk described recently as âproduction hellâ. The 46-year-old had been camping at Teslaâs Gigafactory in Reno, Nevada,  to oversee battery production for the new cars. However, while the company had predicted it would make 1,500 Model 3 cars in the third quarter of 2017, in reality it only managed 260. Tesla said it won't reach its production target of 5,000 Model 3 cars per week until 2018 Depending on your opinion of Mr Musk, launching a new truck at this time is either a bold statement of belief in his technology, and business as usual, or a foolish distraction from Teslaâs main goal of making its Model 3 a mainstream, affordable car. There are elements of the Model 3 in the Tesla Semi. Each of its wheels is powered by a Model 3 motor, and the cab features two of the touch screens displays found in the Model 3. With Tesla Semi, Mr Musk enters a competitive, demanding market. There are an estimated 3.5 million truck drivers in the US, the vast majority of whom drive diesel-powered engines. Tesla will not be able to compete on dieselâs range, and battery specialists doubt Tesla can produce a powerful enough battery at a reasonable price. âA 300-mile-capable battery pack costs about $200,000,â a Carnegie Mellon study concluded. âWhich is much higher than a diesel-powered semi-truck, which costs about $120,000, on average, for the entire vehicle.â Mr Musk said the Tesla Semi would be able to travel 643km (400 miles) after 30 minutes of charge at one of Tesla's new mega-chargers. As for cost, the company said that per mile the Tesla Semi would work out cheaper than a diesel equivalent when fuel and other maintenance is taken into consideration - but did not share the cost of an individual truck. The Diesel Technology Forum, a non-profit trade group that promotes the use of diesel, said Teslaâs announcement needed to be ""evaluated in the context of realityâ. ""Diesel is the most energy efficient internal combustion engine,â Allen Schaeffer, the forum's executive director. ""It has achieved dominance as the technology of choice in the trucking industry over many decades and challenges from many other fuel types. ""Still, today, diesel offers a unique combination of unmatched features: proven fuel efficiency, economical operation, power, reliability, durability, availability, easy access to fuelling and service facilities, and now near-zero emissions performance."" As well as coming up against diesel incumbents, Tesla also faces other electric rivals. Concept electric big rigs have been unveiled by Daimler, Volkswagen and Cummins - though all fall short on range, and none are currently on the roads. Where Tesla believes it can bring an added advantage is with on-board safety and comfort. A statement from Tesla boasted that âjackknifing is prevented due to the Semi's onboard sensors that detect instability and react with positive or negative torque to each wheel while independently actuating all brakes"". ""The surround cameras aid object detection and minimise blind spots, automatically alerting the driver to safety hazards and obstacles. ""With Enhanced Autopilot, the Tesla Semi features Automatic Emergency Braking, Automatic Lane Keeping and Lane Departure Warning.â Autopilot is Teslaâs autonomous driving function that offers several self-driving features, most importantly guiding the vehicle to stay within the lines on the road, and slowing down in keeping with traffic up ahead.

George Bush Snr accused by interpreterAn interpreter claims the former US president groped her at a meeting in Spain in 2004.10m10 minutes agoUS & Canada,"An interpreter, second left, says Mr Bush, centre, groped her in 2004 An eighth woman has come forward with claims that former US president George HW Bush groped her. An interpreter, whom the BBC has agreed not to name because of the sensitive nature of her job, claims Mr Bush touched her inappropriately in 2004. The alleged incident took place at a meeting between the former president and the Spanish defence minister Jose Bono Martinez. The interpreter has not previously spoken publicly about the incident. George Bush Snr 'groped 16-year-old girl' during 2003 photo op ""It was 2004,"" she told the BBC. ""Spanish troops had been withdrawn suddenly from Iraq and I was working as an interpreter in Spain."" Jose Zapatero's Socialist Party unexpectedly won the general election in March of that year. The incumbent US president, George W Bush, was nearing the end of his first term in office. His relationship with Mr Zapatero was markedly frostier than the warm rapport he had enjoyed with the Spanish prime minister's conservative predecessor. George HW Bush, the president's father, was hunting in Spain so, with an interpreter, Mr Martinez was sent to meet him armed with a gift - a pair of hunting rifles. The interpreter would not disclose the contents of the meeting, citing confidentiality concerns. Butmedia reports,externalsuggest Mr Martinez was hoping to enlist Mr Bush's help in establishing greater communication between the US president and the Spanish prime minister. It was at the photo call after the meeting had finished when the alleged incident occurred. ""When the time came to take the photos, Mr Bush insisted on me being in the photo,"" the interpreter said. ""I remember thinking this was odd. Usually we stay outside of the frame. ""He grabbed my bum. At first I thought it was an accident, but then he did it a second time."" Roslyn Corrigan said: ""He dropped his hands down to my buttocks and gave it a nice, ripe squeeze"" Her story is similar to other allegations made against Mr Bush. Another woman, Roslyn Corrigan,told the publication Time,externalthat Mr Bush touched her inappropriately in 2003, when she was 16. On Thursday,CNN reported allegations,externalfrom a 55-year-old woman who said Mr Bush touched her inappropriately in April 1992. In October, a spokesman for Mr Bush, Jim McGrath, acknowledged that Mr Bush had ""on occasionâ¦ patted women's rears in what he intended to be in a good-natured manner"". Mr McGrath partially blamed Mr Bush's use of a wheelchair. ""His arms fall on the lower waist of people with whom he takes pictures,"" he said. The interpreter told the BBC that Mr Bush was standing during the alleged incident. Mr Bush did not start using a wheelchair until around 2012, roughly eight years after the interpreter says the incident took place. ""He was not in a wheelchair at the time. We were standing in front of a fireplace,"" she said. ""I was angry more than upset, but I couldn't say anything in the circumstances. I remember thinking at the time, that he's doing this because he knows I can't say anything. ""How could I create a scene with a minister present when the atmosphere was already tense following the withdrawal of troops by a socialist government?"" George HW Bush, pictured walking with his wife Barbara in 2004 Though she had experienced sexual harassment both before and after the incident, it remains the only time she has experienced it at the hands of a politician. ""When I got home that night, I remember telling my kids,"" she said. ""I happened to comment on it to a colleague and she said the same thing had happened to her. In fact, when articles were published last month she sent me one of them, asking if it sounded familiar. ""I didn't think about it for a long time. Now people are speaking out about it, it's brought all these things flooding back."" It was her daughter who prompted her to contact the BBC, when she sent her the article about Ms Corrigan's allegations. ""I got really angry,"" she said. ""Photo ops obviously were, or are, his modus operandi. I was there because I was a trusted interpreter. I was extremely professional. He was not. ""Who do the men who do these things think they are? I kind of think it's a duty now to speak out."" Mr Bush's spokesman has not responded to requests to comment on the latest allegations. But on Monday, in response to Ms Corrigan's accusation, Mr McGrath told the BBC that Mr Bush ""simply does not have it in his heart to knowingly cause anyone harm or distress, and he again apologises to anyone he may have offended during a photo op"".

Stallone denies sex assault allegationReports say a 16-year-girl told police the actor and his bodyguard assaulted her in the 1980s.3h3 hours ago,"Stallone's spokeswoman said the story was ""categorically false"" Actor Sylvester Stallone has denied reports that he and a bodyguard sexually assaulted a 16-year-old fan in Las Vegas in the 1980s. The Mail Online has published what it says is a police report dating from 1986, which detailed the allegations. The young woman did not press charges, the report said, because she was ""humiliated and ashamed"", as well as being ""scared"". No action was taken. The Rocky star's spokeswoman said the story was ""categorically false"". Michelle Bega described the allegation as ""ridiculous"", adding: ""No one was ever aware of this story until it was published today, including Mr Stallone. ""At no time was Mr Stallone ever contacted by any authorities or anyone else regarding this matter."" The alleged victim said she became intimidated and frightened when the star's bodyguard became involved in the incident in a hotel room, according to the 12-page police report. The report says the girl alleged they met in July 1986 in what was then the Las Vegas Hilton Hotel when she got an autograph from Stallone, then 40. She claimed a bodyguard gave her keys to a hotel room, where she later had sex with both men. The officer wrote: ""She said that after she got dressed, Stallone made the comment to her that they were both married men and that she could not tell anybody about the incident and if she did, that they would have to beat her head in."" A separate report from the sexual assault unit stated the men then laughed, ""and she took it as a joke also"", but after the alleged victim left the room she ""became very distraught and frightened, and wasn't sure that that threat had been a joke after all"". It added that she said she was not physically forced to have intercourse but felt ""intimidated"". Stallone was in Las Vegas at the time making the film Over the Top. His bodyguard, Mike de Luca, was shot dead by police in California four years ago. The allegations were previously published by the Baltimore Post-Examiner last February. Ms Bega declined to comment further when asked if Stallone was aware of them. The Mail said retired Las Vegas Metropolitan Police Department detective sergeant John Samolovitch vouched that ""the copy of the police report is in fact a true copy of the original report"". The force is yet to comment. Stallone's denial comes in the wake of allegations made against key Hollywood figures including Harvey Weinstein, Kevin Spacey and Louis CK.

Any change will do for Zimbabwe,"A man sells watermelon in the capital a day after the military moved against Mr Mugabe Driving around Zimbabwe, one can hardly tell the country is in the middle of the biggest political crisis since independence. In one town, a man in his 20s invites me to his shop and tries to convince me to buy a silver necklace. ""It costs $20 [Â£15],"" he says. ""But for you I can make that $15."" He offers the discount rather half-heartedly. ""You see, people don't want to spend money on thing like these; the economy is really doing badly."" The once-promising African country has sunk into an economic abyss. The government was forced to abolish the country's currency in 2009 because of hyperinflation, and introduced more stable foreign currencies such as the US dollar. Annual inflation reached 231 million per cent in central bank figures reported in July 2008 - officials gave up reporting monthly statistics when it peaked at just under 80 billion per cent in mid-November 2008. On Wednesday this week, the government published the latest inflation rate showing a 2.24% year-on-year rise for the month of October. Some economists, however, say the new figures are a gross underestimate. It is no surprise then that many Zimbabweans almost instantly warmed to the military's move to take control of the country, and confine President Robert Mugabe to his official residence. ""The military has done a good thing,"" says one bookseller. ""They will ensure we get a transitional government."" He is firmly convinced that Mr Mugabe's 37-year rule is coming to an end. There has been a sudden change of tone in the country, and the sense is that many Zimbabweans have been yearning for change. Any change, it seems, would do.

She thanks them, but politely declines the invitation and walks away. Traders working in a troubled economy hope that change will improve their fortunes The traders believe their economic situation will improve once Mr Mugabe's rule ends. But there is still political uncertainty surrounding the succession. The once-vibrant opposition has begun to speak out, and the former Prime Minister, Morgan Tsvangirai, is now back in the country. He has demanded that President Mugabe steps down. What started as a split within the ruling Zanu-PF party could well develop into a broader crisis with politicians from across the divide angling to take over from Mr Mugabe. But the president still commands a lot of respect as an independence icon. The same respect does not seem to be extended to his wife, Grace, who was thought to be his preferred successor.

Police chief pay and perks revealed,"Wide variations in the way police chiefs are paid have been revealed, as the pay, allowances and expenses of senior police officers in England and Wales are published for the first time. The statistics, for 2015-16, show salary payments ranging from Â£7,622 to Â£278,563. Meanwhile, benefits range from none at all to Â£32,521 in one case. The Home Office, which compiled the data, also set a limit on the amount of annual leave chief constables can take. Salaries for chief constables and deputy chief constables are determined by rank, the size of their force and the area's population. The publication is part of an attempt to increase transparency across forces. The figures show that some earned thousands of pounds in ""benefits in kind"", while a small number claimed large sums in expenses, and others received nothing but their salary. Nick Gargan, who resigned from Avon and Somerset police following a misconduct inquiry, was given Â£39,000 for what is described as ""compensation for loss of office"". Reality check: Is public sector pay higher than private sector? Public sector pay: Will they or won't they? Mick Creedon, who was in charge of Derbyshire police, received a ""retention"" payment and money for a medical scheme of almost Â£34,000 on top of his Â£142,000 salary, the data shows. An assistant chief constable for Dyfed Powys received Â£30,139 for ""relocation expenses"". There is no suggestion of any wrongdoing. Nick Gargan resigned from Avon and Somerset police following a misconduct inquiry in 2015 The figures offer a snapshot for 2015-16, with some representing just a portion of an annual salary with staff only having been in post for part of the year. The largest salary listed, of Â£278,563, was for the head of the Metropolitan police in London. by BBC Home Affairs correspondent, Danny Shaw It may not be a coincidence that the Home Office has chosen to publish the figures just five days before the Budget. The chancellor has faced growing calls from chief constables to inject extra money into the police service. And although senior officers' pay represents a fraction of overall costs, the release of the data is a subtle reminder, perhaps, that forces can still afford to reward senior brass handsomely. All of the chief constables earn more than the policing minister, with some salaries dwarfing the home secretary's pay and even that of the prime minster, who takes home Â£150,402. No doubt chiefs would say they're worth it: being in charge of a police force carries immense responsibility - when vacancies arise there are often not many candidates. Nevertheless, the figures have exposed inconsistencies in the way senior officers are rewarded for their considerable efforts which the staff who work for them and members of the public may not be entirely comfortable with. In an effort to iron out inconsistencies in holiday entitlement, senior officers will in future be able to take no more than 35 days' leave each year. The current model allows for 48 days a year, but with poorly defined rest days. When they leave their job they must notify their force if they are employed elsewhere. The figures, for 261 of the most senior police officers up to the rank of chief constable, have been published on the Police UK website. It is hoped that the overhaul could act as a blueprint for other sectors. Policing Minister Nick Hurd said the figures would bring greater clarity and accountability to the public, as did Mark Polin, chair of the Chief Police Officers Staff Association. Julia Mulligan, who speaks on transparency and integrity for the Association of Police and Crime Commissioners, said they would bring greater transparency.

Reality Check: Zimbabwe's false rumoursFive things you should know about ZimbabweConfusion over Zimbabwean Twitter accounts,"After reports emerged of the military seizing control in Zimbabwe, social media was full of stories about what was happening during a stunning 24 hours, but not all were accurate. Robert Mugabe, the country's leader for more than three decades, was put under house arrest, and he wasn't the only government figure to be swept up in the military's action. The Finance Minister, Ignatius Chombo, had also been detained,a government source told the Reuters news agency,external. And it's beenreported,externalthat one Zimbabwean MP told al-Jazeera that $10m (Â£7.5m) had been recovered from Mr Chombo's house.

Five things you should know about ZimbabweConfusion over Zimbabwean Twitter accounts,"As the world waits to see what happens next after Robert Mugabe refused to resign despite pressure from the army and the ruling Zanu-PF party, we look at some of the key things you should know about the country and its current situation. Zimbabwe has gone from one economic crisis to another over the last decade. Estimates of the country's unemployment levels vary, butthe country's biggest trade union claims the jobless rate was as high as 90% earlier this year,external. Zimbabwe has struggled with hyperinflation, which peaked in 2008 with an official rate of 231 million per cent. The country wasforced to abandon its own currency at a rate of Z$35 quadrillion to US$1, adopting the use of foreign cash. Because of a continuing chronic shortage of hard money, the government issued their own version of dollars called bond notes, but they have rapidly lost their value. People with money stored electronically in banks are unable to access it, or are subject to strict limits on what they can withdraw. Because of this, crypto-currencies that are traded online have risen in popularity. Following the news of the military takeover, Bitcoin prices in Harare surged on Wednesday. Zimbabwe crisis in 10 numbers The 93-year-old leader has confounded his critics by staying in power for so long. Sometimes dismissed as a cartoon figure abroad, he was viewed in Zimbabwe, at least originally, as a revolutionary hero who fought against white minority rule, and stillenjoys respect as the ""father of the nation"". But he and his supporters have used violence to keep a tight grip on power, using the machinery of the state to bolster his party and himself. His party says it is fighting capitalism and colonialism, but the country's economic problems have tested even his most ardent supporters. He has often said he would only step down when his ""revolution"" was complete, but also wants to handpick his successor - something that led to the current crisis. Robert Mugabe - Revolutionary hero or the man who wrecked Zimbabwe? Aged 93 and in visible decline, the battle to succeed him intensified in recent months. The ruling party split into two factions - one backing his wife Grace, 40 years his junior, and the other his long-time ally, Emmerson Mnangagwa. When he sacked Mr Mnangagwa, it was obvious that he was backing his wife to take power. She was deeply unpopular, partly because of her love of shopping, which led to her nickname ""Gucci Grace"". Mr Mnangagwa fought in the 1970s war of independence which brought Mr Mugabe to power and retains close ties with many other former comrades, who occupy senior positions across the top of all of Zimbabwe's security forces. So when he was ousted, they intervened on his behalf. Who is Grace Mugabe? If the ousted Mr Mnangagwa does succeed Mr Mugabe as president, he is cut from the same cloth. He has featured prominently in all of the atrocities and attacks on opposition supporters which have been carried out since Mr Mugabe came to power. However, he has hinted that he may introduce some economic reforms, and even work with the opposition in some form of transitional government. Emmerson Mnangagwa: The 'crocodile' who snapped back The military certainly intervened, however they have not replaced the president - yet. In a statement on television, the military said it had temporarily taken control to ""target criminals"" around the head of state, not Mr Mugabe himself, and still referred to him as ""commander-in-chief"". The army wants a veneer of constitutionality to be preserved, and certainly none of his former comrades wants to arrest him, or worse, as often happens to leaders when the military takes over. The army wants a political process to play out - Mr Mugabe to resign and Zanu-PF to name a new leader. And the military encouraged a public march to increase pressure on him, and show that their actions had the popular support. So far, however, he is refusing to play ball, even though the ruling Zanu-PF party has sacked him as its leader, and so parliament may have to impeach him. However, on Sunday, Mr Mugabe vowed to remain as president until the Zanu-PF congress, due in December, so it is far from clear what happens next.

Eviction threat over crying babyA family renting in London are threatened with eviction after complaints over a crying baby.3h3 hours agoFamily & Education,"The Wurth family were told they might be evicted because their baby was crying A family renting in London have been threatened with eviction after complaints that their baby was crying. They were warned by the management firm that if the noise went on they could be given ""two weeks' notice to vacate"". The parents, with a 15-month-old daughter and a three-year-old son, say it is ""horrible discrimination"" against families renting with children. The management firm said neighbours were being disturbed by noisy children and ""other noise nuisance"". Neighbours had complained ""on a daily basis"" and the other tenants had a right not to be troubled by noise, the company said. Attila and Ildiko Wurth, with their two young children, are living in a privately rented top-floor flat in a converted house in Hammersmith, west London. They say they were shaken to receive an email from the managing agent, saying there had been a ""complaint stating that at 5.30am this morning a baby was crying and stamping and then further noise starting again at 6.45am, which woke one of the other tenants in the property"". ""We have subsequently liaised with your landlord and are instructed that we are to agree arrangements with you to vacate the property as soon as possible."" This video can not be played Attila Wurth says the family was shocked and upset by the idea of being evicted Attila says they were shocked by this ""heartless and harsh"" attitude and deeply upset by the idea of being thrown out of their home. Another email said there had been further complaints and ""if this continues we will have no choice but to issue a Section 8 notice, which will give you two weeks' notice to vacate"". The Wurths were told: ""Please ensure to keep all movement and noise to a minimum."" Uncertain about what to do next, they sought advice and were directed towards a housing helpline, which they said was always engaged. In the end it was social media that got them some support, putting their problem on to Facebook. ""We felt so scared. We didn't know what happens next. Will we come home and find our things in the road?"" Rising numbers of families are now living long-term in rented accommodation. While once couples with children might have bought their own place, more are renting into their 30s and 40s - and the case highlights the pressures facing ""generation rent"". Attila works as a vet, but says the couple can't afford to buy in London. ""We pay our own way, but we have no more to spare. ""You have to be extremely rich to have children in London,"" he says. The local authority, Hammersmith and Fulham, says that about a third of the residents in the borough are private renters. This year it extended a licensing scheme to try to give private renters more protection and to ensure their legal rights. The email to the Wurths warns of a ""Section 8"" eviction - referring to the Housing Act of 1988, which would allow a landlord to remove tenants before the end of their tenancy agreement. The housing charity Shelter says this would require grounds such as not paying rent, anti-social behaviour or a breach of the tenancy agreement. More families like the Wurths are staying in rented accommodation This could include being a ""nuisance"" to neighbours - but a court would have to decide whether such claims were reasonable. ""We have been very careful about noise,"" says Attila. But if landlords rent to a family with young children, he says, it is unrealistic to think that a baby won't cry sometimes. ""We don't even have a stereo or a TV to make noise with - and we have avoided making any noise with household activities,"" says Attila. The managing agent, Sheraton Management Ltd, says the Wurths ""were in breach of contract as they were causing disturbance to the other occupants of the building... not only relating to noisy children, but also other noise nuisance"". The agent says there had been ""banging, stamping, loud footsteps"". ""Reluctantly, as there was no remission in the problem, it was on this basis that we advised Mrs Wurth that we may be left with no alternative but to serve a notice for possession,"" it says. The management company says it has a responsibility to other tenants in the building - and to claims ""that their contractual right to quiet enjoyment has been breached"". Sheraton's statement says: ""We manage numerous properties lived in by families, some with very young children. Our policy is always to avoid the necessity for repossession proceedings."" The Wurths are waiting to hear what will happen next.

Dad guilty of murdering son and daughterEndris Mohammed killed his son and daughter by smothering them with a petrol-soaked rag.11m11 minutes agoBirmingham & Black Country,"Saros and Leanor Endris were killed in October last year A father has been found guilty of murdering his two young children who he smothered with a petrol-soaked rag before setting fire to the family home. Saros Endris, eight, and his sister Leanor, six, were found dead at their house in Birmingham in October 2016. Their father Endris Mohammed, 47, also tried to kill his wife by attempting to cause a gas explosion. Paying tribute to her children, Penil Teklehaimanot, Mohammed's wife, said they had brought joy to her life. She said their deaths had ""had a profound effect and changed my life forever"". This video can not be played Birmingham father who killed children captured on CCTV Midlands Live: Rough sleepers could get Â£1,000 fine; Headbutted paramedic 'shaken' by attack A two-week trial at Birmingham Crown Court was told Mohammedappeared normalin the run-up to the deaths. He was found guilty of two counts of murder and one of attempted murder after the jury deliberated for under 30 minutes. Mrs Teklehaimanot said in evidence that she was woken by a smoke alarm at her home in Holland Road, Great Barr and initially thought her children were asleep when she was unable to wake them. Mohammed had denied the murders, claiming diminished responsibility allegedly caused by a depressive disorder. Police said he was found sitting in his car in Newcastle-under-Lyme, Staffordshire, with severe burns after setting fire to himself (some may find the picture below distressing). The court heard Mohammed told a psychiatrist he intended to take his own life and had smothered the children after becoming depressed and deciding they ""would be better off dead"". However, Det Insp Justin Spanner, of West Midlands Police, said there was no previous history of mental illness. ""As part of our investigation we spoke to people who were in his taxi on that day and they say he was happy, chatting and he seemed very normal,"" he said. Mohammed will be sentenced on Monday. Endris Mohammed suffered burns when he set his car on fire Trial judge Mr Justice Gilbart, addressing the jurors after the verdicts, told them: ""You've just dealt with a very important case. ""It's an important public service. You've earned the thanks of the public for the vital work you've done."" Paying tribute to the children, Mrs Teklehaimanot said: ""They seem too full of life and all the promise of things to come. Their futures stretched out before them - like a book waiting to be read."" She added that Saros ""was the most polite well-mannered child"", while Leanor ""was a wonderful, mature girl"". Jurors were told Mohammed carried out the killings during a ""sleepover"" in the lounge Mrs Teklehaimanot said the pair met in 2006 in Kent, after they both came to Britain from East Africa as asylum seekers. She told the court he was a ""gentle, quiet man"" and his personality had not changed in any way since 2006. Mohammed did not give evidence during his defence case but argued through his legal team that he was depressed about his future amid money worries. Jurors heard Mohammed, who was an Uber driver, claimed he had decided to end his own life because his ""hopes for a good life in England"" had failed. He told police in a statement handed to officers in January that he had no money. Mrs Teklehaimanot told the court she was not in debt and that the couple's rent payments were not in arrears.

Ambulance staff morale 'at rock bottom',"Morale in the Scottish Ambulance Service is at ""rock bottom"" because of excessive demands placed on staff, according to the union Unite. The BBC has obtained the results of an internal staff survey suggesting work pressure had affected the health of more than half of the respondents. Unite also warned of increase in the ""turnaround"" times before an ambulance is ready for its next call. The ambulance service said it took the wellbeing of staff very seriously. A spokesman added that it was working closely with health boards to improve turnaround times across Scotland. Nearly two in five of ambulance services employees responded to the survey, which was carried out at the start of the year. The vast majority said they ""strongly agreed"" morale was low - with more than one in four saying they had considered leaving because of pressure at work. Unite said the centralisation of hospital services has increased the time it takes ambulance staff to turnaround 999 calls and, with fewer casualty departments, there are bottlenecks in dropping patients off. The union's national convenor, paramedic Jamie McNamee, told BBC Scotland it used to take an average of 54 minutes in Glasgow in between the ambulance service receiving a 999 call and the ambulance being available for another call. He said this had now increased to one hour and 30 minutes, meaning many ambulances were unavailable to take on further emergency calls. ""I would suggest if you took a camera up to the casualty department at the Glasgow Royal Infirmary or at the Queen Elizabeth Hospital at any day of the week, you'll see a huge array of ambulance vehicles sitting there at any one time,"" he said. ""Inside the hospital it would not be unknown to have a corridor full of ambulance trolleys and patients on these trolleys waiting to get an appropriate clinical handover."" 85% of staff strongly agreed morale was low in SAS 54% of staff strongly agreed pressure at work had affected their health 28% of staff claimed to be subjected to bullying at work 27% of staff had considered leaving SAS due to pressure at work A Scottish Ambulance Service spokesman said the figures quoted were from a ""historic survey"", with the latest results being published in the new year. ""We recognise that whilst our staff do a tremendous job caring for patients and saving lives each day, working for the ambulance service can be stressful at times given the situations they can face each day. ""We take the health and wellbeing of our staff very seriously and we have a wide range of support available including counselling support, occupational health services and other procedures in place to ensure any wider issues raised are dealt with."" The service said turnaround times could be affected by a wide range of factors, including high call volumes; people self-presenting at accident and emergency departments; people in care settings requiring hospital treatment; and the time taken to clean vehicles. ""We recognise that there are pressures on hospitals during peak periods and we are continuing to work closely with health boards to improve turnaround times across Scotland,"" said the spokesman. ""Equipment is often missing or not working."" ""Ambulance control bully and harass crews continually."" ""Vehicles keep breaking down so don't feel confident while out on the road."" ""Bullying by management is rife and the fear to report it is high due to historical events."" ""Vehicles not fit for purpose.""

Glitter banned by children's nurseries,"This video can not be played Group manager Harriet Pacey said their nurseries already avoid a lot of single-use items Glitter has been banned by a chain of children's nurseries because of the ""terrible damage"" it does to the environment. The art material is washed into the water system and can end up in the food chain, Tops Day Nurseries insisted. It added glitter was a microplastic which was ""almost impossible to remove from the environment"". The Marine Conservation Society welcomed the nurseries' ""proactive approach"" towards reducing pollution. Glitter is ""almost impossible to remove from the environment"", the company said The nursery chain said it had only recently become aware of the ""dangers"" of glitter. Managing director Cheryl Hadland said ""You can see when the children are taking their bits of craft home and there's glitter on the cardboard, it blows off and into the air. ""There are 22,000 nurseries in the country, so if we're all getting through kilos and kilos of glitter, we're doing terrible damage."" Ms Hadland, who runs nurseries in Dorset, Hampshire, the Isle of Wight, Somerset and Wiltshire, said she ""loved glitter"" but was trying to source an alternative material from suppliers. Plastic waste in the oceans allows the material to enter the food chain, marine biologists say Nursery group manager Harriet Pacey said most parents would back the change. She said: ""I can imagine that, yes, initially it's going to be a bit of a 'what?' but I think they're going to be behind us."" Sue Kinsey from the Marine Conservation Society said most microplastics in the sea came from other products. She said: ""While glitter is only a small part of the microplastic load getting into watercourses and the sea, steps like these will all add up to something greater."" The United Nations has estimated that there are 46,000 pieces of waste plastic per square mile of sea. The international body's environment agency, UNEP, said plastic waste in the ocean was allowing the material to enter the food chain.

HS2 contractor's shares hit by profit alert,"Carillion is a member of the consortium that is building parts of the HS2 rail link Shares in Carillion, the UK's second-biggest construction firm, fell 48% on Friday after it issued its third profit warning since July and said it expected to breach its loan conditions. The firm blamed slower asset sales and delays to a Middle East project. Carillion is a major supplier to the government and helps to maintain schools and hospitals. It is also part of a consortium building the Â£56bn HS2 high-speed rail link. The latest announcement follows separate profit warnings issued inJuly,externalandSeptember,externalthis year. In its latest update,,externalthe company said it might need ""some form of recapitalisation"" in order to revive its fortunes. Simon Jack: Carillion is on government radar Interim chief executive Keith Cochrane said: ""Whilst we continue to target cash collections, reduce costs, execute disposals and focus on delivering for our customers, it is clear that significant challenges remain and more needs to be done to reduce net debt and rebuild the balance sheet."" Carillion said profits for this year would be ""materially lower than current market expectations"", and it now expected average net borrowing in 2017 to be between Â£875m and Â£925m. HS2 and Crossrail Battersea Power Station Hundreds of UK schools NHS services Library of Birmingham Aberdeen Bypass Projects across the Middle East and Canada The company said that based on its latest forecasts it expected it would breach its financial covenants - agreements with its lenders - at the end of the year. The Cabinet Office said it had been ""kept informed"" of steps taken by Carillion to restructure its business. ""We remain supportive of their ongoing discussions with their stakeholders and await future updates on their progress,"" a government spokesperson said. The contractor plays an integral role in the UK's services industry. As well as HS2, it has worked or is working onCrossrail,external, Battersea Power Station, the Library of Birmingham, and hundreds of schools, where it provides facility management services. It has also been involved in major projects across the Middle East that include the New York University in Abu Dhabi and the Royal Opera House of Oman. Shares in the company have now fallen by about 90% this year. ""The company is admitting what we've all already suspected: it will need some sort of debt restructuring,"" said Sam Bland of JP Morgan. ""More organic methods simply aren't going to be feasible"". ""If debt restructuring happens, you have to presume that current shareholders would be left with very little value,"" he added. In July this year, Carillion shares plunged after it had to set aside Â£845m in provisions and its chief executive, Richard Howson, stepped down. At the time, the government was forced to seek assurances from Carillion's partners on the HS2 project that they could step in to complete the work if necessary. A high profile bust would come at a bad time for a government keen to big up its economic dynamism. Next week's unveiling of its Industrial Strategy and the chancellor's Budget are expected to feature investment in housing and infrastructure. Having the UK's second biggest construction firm go under would not improve the economic mood music. The government is monitoring the situation but might find it hard to do more than that. Some have said that Carillion is ""too big to fail"" but Carillion is not RBS and the Treasury might take the view it is ""too small to save"" and would prefer to let the market do its work. Read Simon's blog in full Carillion has been scrambling to bolster its finances amid writedowns on some of its projects. Last month, it resorted to selling its UK healthcare arm to public-services provider Serco for Â£50m. The sale amounted to ""peanuts"" considering it was a high-margin business, said Neil Wilson, an analyst at ETX Capital. ""Disposals aren't enough, particularly as Carillion is selling things on the cheap"", he said. He added: ""Some investors might think this is the end, but Carillion is too big to fail. ""Government intervention is possible but this is a nightmare for ministers at such a sensitive moment for the economy"". Carillion has contracts in aviation, defence, retail, healthcare, education, oil and gas, and transport. On Wednesday, a Carillion joint venturesigned a deal,externalwith Oman's Ministry of Health for a new hospital in Salalah which was valued at about Â£240m. Other recent deals include a joint-venture contract withNetwork Rail,externalthat the company says could generate up to Â£260m in revenue over three years. Mr Bland of JP Morgan said contracts that have hurt Carillion include a hospital in Liverpool, a bypass in Aberdeen and a tramway in Sheffield. All three projects experienced delays of at least a year. ""I don't think anyone's hopeful about Carillion,"" he said. Jack: Carillion is on government radar Where did Carillion's problems come from?

UK explorer flown out of jungleBenedict Allen became disorientated with fever while trying to reach a remote tribe in Papua New Guinea.,"This video can not be played In a recent documentary Benedict Allen described his experiences of living in Papua New Guinea British explorer Benedict Allen has been flown out of the jungle in Papua New Guinea and is expected home on Sunday. Mr Allen became disorientated with fever while trying to reach a remote tribe and missed his flight home, the BBC's Frank Gardner said. The 57-year-old had taken no means of communication with him, prompting his family to mount a search on Monday. He was spotted""alive and well"" on Thursdaynear a remote airstrip. Mr Allen, who had been looked after by Christian missionaries after trekking large distances, was flown by helicopter to the Papua New Guinea capital of Port Moresby on Friday.

Mafia 'boss of bosses' Riina dies in jail,"""Toto"" Riina was finally captured in 1993 Notorious Sicilian Mafia ""boss of all bosses"" Salvatore ""Toto"" Riina has died from cancer in jail, aged 87. Riina was serving 26 life sentences and is believed to have ordered more than 150 murders. The head of the feared Cosa Nostra spent nearly a quarter of a century on the run before being jailed in 1993. He ordered more murders from jail. As well as kidney cancer, he was said to have been suffering from a heart condition and Parkinson's disease. Riina had been in a medically induced coma and his family had been given special permission to visit him in the prisoners' wing of the hospital in Parma, northern Italy. No Italy 'baby bonus' for Mafia boss's daughter Lucia Riina Mafia boss's son's interview sparks fury in Italy The secret lives of the Mafia hunters Riina was born in 1930 to poor farmers in Corleone, Sicily - the birthplace of Don Corleone, the fictional Godfather in Francis Ford Coppola's film trilogy. His father was killed when he was 13 and at 19 he joined the local Mafia, committing murder to gain entry. He spent six years in prison. When he got out, he helped local mobster Luciano Leggio kill Corleone's Mafia boss. Along with childhood friend Bernardo Provenzano, he then led a hit squad targeting Mafia boss Michele ""the Cobra"" Cavataio in Palermo, giving the Corleone clan a foothold in the Sicilian capital. When Leggio was arrested in 1974, Riina became boss. Under his leadership, the clan came to dominate the Cosa Nostra crime group in the 1970s, as its fortunes blossomed, buoyed by a booming trade trafficking heroin to North America. He was a wanted man, but evaded justice for 24 years, remaining all the while on the island of Sicily. The Mafia is notorious for brutality, but Riina was the most savage of all, earning him the nickname ""The Beast"". ""He was the fiercest and the nastiest mobster in the mafia probably in history,"" Francesco Bongarra, a journalist with Italian news agency Ansa, told the BBC. Judge Giovanni Falcone, second from left, earned Riina's wrath by jailing scores of mafiosos in the 1980s The judge was killed in a 1992 bombing that left this wreckage of a police car - ordered by Riina While his cruelty propelled him up the ranks it was also key to his downfall, and to a pivotal point in Mafia relations with the Italian state. In 1981, Riina began a two-year drive dubbed ""The Slaughter"" to eliminate his rivals, causing many mobsters to fear for their own lives and those of their families. Many broke their code of silence and began to co-operate with investigators, resulting in a breakthrough case which saw hundreds of mafiosos convicted. Riina did not take this lying down. In 1992, within two months the two leading judges in the case, Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, had been blown up. But six months later, Riina was arrested. What has happened since his incarceration? In detention, Riina's savagery continued. He ordered the murder of a 13-year-old boy kidnapped to try to prevent his father revealing information about the Mafia. The boy was strangled and his body dissolved in acid. And, partly in protest at his arrest, his associates carried out a series of bombings in Rome, Milan and Florence in 1993, leaving 10 people dead. Riina had been imprisoned under the ""Article 41-bis prison regime"" imposing tight security measures on Mafiosos intended to completely cut off prisoners from their criminal contacts. In his final days in jail, Riina was recorded saying he ""regrets nothing"" The regime includes strictly limited visits from his family. Petitions for him to be released into house arrest for his last days were met with angry protests from the relatives of some of his many victims. Earlier this year, Riina was recorded on a wiretap saying he ""regrets nothing... They'll never break me, even if they give me 3,000 years"" in jail, reported AFP news agency. And indeed he has never broken his silence. Riina leaves behind a wife, Antonietta, and four children, including his eldest son, Giovanni, who is serving a life sentence in jail for four murders.

What next for Robert Mugabe?,"Robert Mugabe has led Zimbabwe for 37 years Zimbabwe's ruling Zanu-PF party is planning to support impeachment proceedings against Robert Mugabe, after he ignored a deadline to stand down as president. Zimbabweans - and many watching around the world - were astounded on Sunday night when Mr Mugabe addressed the nation and said that far from stepping down, he was going to stay on and preside over the ruling party's congress in December. So with Mr Mugabe defiant, and the army insisting that it has not carried out a a coup, what are the options for getting him to vacate his position? Here are five possible scenarios: Zanu-PF members sang and danced as they sacked Mr Mugabe as leader Zanu-PF says it will launch impeachment proceedings against Mr Mugabe when parliament convenes on Tuesday. Impeachment is the process of removing a president via parliament. Both the National Assembly and the Senate can begin proceedings to remove the president if both pass simple majority votes against him. A two-thirds majority is needed in both houses in order for impeachment to succeed. Zanu-PF has a two-thirds majority in the House of Assembly, but not the Senate. The formal process is expected to start on Tuesday but it is not clear how long it would take. The benefit of this process for the military is that it allows the generals to say the removal of the president was done in accordance with the constitution, in keeping with their statement that this is not a coup. The downside for them is that it does not guarantee that the man widely thought to be their favourite for president will get the top job straight away. People in Harare celebrated Zanu-PF sacked Robert Mugabe as their leader Emmerson Mnangagwa, whose sacking prompted the military's action, could not immediately take over from Mr Mugabe, because constitutionally it is the current vice-president who should fill the vacancy. At the moment that person is Phelekezela Mphoko - a man whose sympathies are known to lie with Grace Mugabe, and who was expelled by Zanu-PF on Sunday. Whether the army can persuade Mr Mugabe to appoint their preferred candidate as vice-president before stepping down remains to be seen. Some analysts have argued that this may be what the generals were discussing with him - and it may also be his trump card. But given how difficult it has been to get Mr Mugabe to step down, the chances of getting him to concede further ground look increasingly slim. Five things you should know about Zimbabwe This video can not be played Robert Mugabe: ""The congress is due... I will preside over its processes"" President Mugabe was defiant when he made his televised address on Sunday. Despite having been sacked by Zanu-PF, he said ""the party congress is due in a few weeks and I will preside over its processes"". He suggested that he was willing to forgive the military action, and said ""whatever the pros and cons of how they [the army] went about their operation, I, as commander-in-chief, do acknowledge their concerns"". It had been reported that Mr Mugabe had agreed to resign. It is unclear whether he changed his mind, or if these reports were incorrect. But BBC Africa editor Fergal Keane says it makes the military look weak. Some suggest that there may be grounds within Zanu-PF's own rules which might allow Mr Mugabe to reject his sacking by the party. President Mugabe is known for both being shrewd and stubborn. So he may well have another ace up his sleeve. Robert Mugabe - hero or villain? There is growing speculation over the whereabouts of Grace Mugabe Initially it had been thought that the military was trying to reach a deal which would allow President Mugabe to stay in Zimbabwe once he had stood down. But the current stalemate makes that look less likely. From the point of view of Mr Mugabe, and his wife, there is a fear that even if he were to be promised immunity from prosecution now, that could be removed by a future government. So it might mean that Mr Mugabe is forced into exile. Until recently, neighbouring South Africa would have been a natural place for him to go. Mr Mugabe enjoys a high level of respect there, in large part because of his support for the fight against apartheid rule. Indeed, the opposition EFF party has called on the government to ""prepare to welcome President Mugabe for political asylum"". Allow Twitter content?

The Mugabes are reported to have a number of properties in South Africa. The sticking point would be what happens to Grace. She was granted diplomatic immunity after allegedly assaulting a model in a hotel room in Johannesburg in August. But model Gabriella Engels is trying to get the diplomatic immunity order set aside. If successful, it would mean Mrs Mugabe could face prosecution should she go to South Africa. So if not South Africa, then where? Other possible options are Singapore and Malaysia, where the Mugabes also have properties. 'Gucci Grace' The leader of the opposition Movement for Democratic Change-Tsvangirai (MDC-T) party is back in Harare after receiving treatment for cancer in South Africa, fuelling speculation about negotiations for a unity government. Morgan Tsvangirai is back in Harare This is the scenario that many in the West, and of course the opposition, would prefer. Another opposition leader, Tendai Biti, has said that he would join a national unity government if Mr Tsvangirai was also in it. But the military takeover was not a change of regime. It was an internal dispute within Zanu-PF, and that party is still very much in power. The military is to a large extent the armed wing of Zanu-PF. And the man it supports as leader - Emmerson Mnangagwa - helped Robert Mugabe carry out some of his most controversial policies. Emmerson Mnangagwa is the man the military wants to take over He is also, some say, more ruthless. So it is far from clear that the ousting of Mr Mugabe would improve the lives of ordinary Zimbabweans. Zimbabwe's next president?

Debunking false rumours,"After reports emerged of the military seizing control in Zimbabwe, social media was full of stories about what was happening during a stunning 24 hours, but not all were accurate. Robert Mugabe, the country's leader for more than three decades, was put under house arrest, and he wasn't the only government figure to be swept up in the military's action. The Finance Minister, Ignatius Chombo, had also been detained,a government source told the Reuters news agency,external. And it's beenreported,externalthat one Zimbabwean MP told al-Jazeera that $10m (Â£7.5m) had been recovered from Mr Chombo's house. This claim of a vast stash of cash in the home a politician in poverty-stricken Zimbabwe sparked anger in some corners of the online press, but it also led to the use of incorrect photos.

Mother 'could not go on' without son,"Kelly-Anne Carter suffered severe burns in the fire A woman whose eight-year-old son died in a house fire killed herself because she could not go on without him, an inquest has found. Kelly-Anne Carter, 35, suffered serious burns in the fire at the family home in Sandbach, Cheshire, on 30 October 2016. Lucas Carter died shortly after he was rescued from the blaze which was not treated as suspicious. Miss Carter's friend told the court the mother had described herself as a ""dead woman walking"". Midlands Live: Light aircraft crashes after overshooting runway; Trio forced girl, 14 into prostitution The inquest at Crewe Municipal Buildings on Thursday heard Miss Carter's partner found her hanged at his home on 12 November 2016. Sarah Blakey, Miss Carter's friend who was with her the night before she died, told the court: ""She didn't want to be here without Lucas, she couldn't forgive herself. ""He was her world. To her he was her greatest achievement and he was lovely, he was an absolute credit."" A verdict of suicide was recorded by coroner Claire Welch. The fire in Sandbach was not treated as suspicious by police Ms Welch said: ""I can't imagine the distress and trauma that she must have been going through at this time, having gone through such a traumatic experience and lost her only child."" The coroner for Cheshire also paid tribute to the ""dignity and calmness"" showed by Miss Carter's sister Gemma Williams during the inquest. ""To have lost Lucas and then Kelly in such short succession is unimaginable from my point of view so my heartfelt condolences really do go out to you and all your family,"" she said. The inquest heard medical notes recording Miss Carter's comments telling staff she would hang herself or overdose once she was home were not passed on when she was transferred to Macclesfield Hospital. But Ms Welch said the mistake did not cause or contribute to her death. She said she was satisfied that at the time of her discharge it was considered more appropriate to allow Miss Carter to be with her family and to plan Lucas's funeral. An inquest into Lucas's death has not yet been held.

Chicken supplier problems 'not a one-off',"MPs said their inquiry should act as a ""wake-up call"" for the wider food industry Problems at a major UK chicken supplier forced to suspend operations over hygiene concerns were ""not a one-off"", MPs have claimed. A site run by the 2 Sisters Food Group in the West Midlands had a ""far from pristine"" past record, the Environment, Food and Rural Affairs Committee said. Its month-long inquiry also raised concerns about how the production plant was being monitored by authorities. 2 Sisters, which has 12 UK sites, said it took safety ""extremely seriously"". Marks & Spencer, Aldi, Lidl and The Co-op stopped taking chickens from the West Bromwich site after the Guardian and ITV News claimedworkers were changing the slaughter dates to extend the shelf life of meat. Undercover reporters also alleged workers were repackaging chicken portions that had been returned by supermarkets - before sending them out to other retailers. MPs said their investigation looked at the ""apparently patchwork"" nature of the industry's accreditation process and how the 2 Sisters site had been checked for quality, rather than whether it breached food standards. MPs also looked at the role and performance of the Food Standards Agency (FSA), Sandwell Metropolitan Council and other bodies. Committee chairman Neil Parish said the inquiry should act as a ""wake-up call"" for food accreditation firms to ""improve their processes"". He said: ""Food supply chains are sensitive and easy to disrupt when retailers and consumers lose confidence in food quality or safety. ""Large producers and retailers have a responsibility to protect, rather than undermine, the UK's food producers."" The report said it was easy for processors to ""game the system and hide infractions"" from inspectors - for example by opting out of unannounced visits by accreditors. MPs said even unannounced visits were not truly a ""surprise"", because workers were given about 30 minutes and so they tend to be on their ""best behaviour"". The inquiry found that Assured Food Standards, which licenses the Red Tractor quality mark, did not ""immediately and especially"" inform the FSA when it briefly suspended the 2 Sisters accreditation between 2 and 9 October. Ranjit Singh Boparan, chief executive of 2 Sisters, gave evidence to MPs last month Ranjit Singh Boparan, 2 Sisters' chief executive, wrote to MPs, promising that he would make a number of changes - including placing a full-time FSA inspector at all plants. He also invited the committee to visit a 2 Sisters Food Group plant, unannounced if members wished. He said he would install CCTV with complete coverage in all plants within 120 days, and put ""mystery workers"" into all factories by the end of January 2018. The committee's report concluded: ""The problems identified at the 2 Sisters plant at West Bromwich were not a one-off."" It added: ""The past record of the 2 Sisters Food Group is far from pristine and there are valid questions to be asked of its corporate governance structure."" The FSA'sown investigation into the firm,externalhas been widened to 2 Sisters' poultry operations across England and Wales, which process about six million chickens a week, with Food Standards Scotland looking at its Coupar Angus site.

Jared Kushner 'withheld WikiLeaks emails',"White House senior aide Jared Kushner failed to disclose emails he received about WikiLeaks and ""a Russian backdoor overture"" in 2016, senators have said. Two senators sent Mr Kushner a letter demanding additional documents as part of an ongoing investigation into Russia's alleged election meddling. The lawmakers said they became aware of the documents through other witnesses. A lawyer for Mr Kushner, Donald Trump's son-in-law, said he was ""open to responding to any additional requests"". Senate Judiciary committee chairman Senator Charles Grassley, a Republican, and Senator Diane Feinstein, top Democrat on the panel, wrote that the emails were omitted from documents Mr Kushner was asked to turn over last month. ""We appreciate your voluntary cooperation with the Committee's investigation, but the production appears to have been incomplete,"" they wrote in a letter on Thursday to his attorney, Abbe Lowell. Mr Lowell said in a statement his client provided ""all relevant documents that had to do with Mr Kushner's calls, contacts or meetings with Russians during the campaign and transition, which was the request"". The pair claim Mr Kushner, who is married to President Trump's daughter Ivanka, received emails concerning WikiLeaks as well as ""documents concerning a 'Russia back door overture and dinner invite'"", which he forwarded to other campaign officials. Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? The 'cloud' over the Trump White House The Senate panel said there are ""several documents that are known to exist"" because other witnesses provided documents which Mr Kushner was copied on, but did not disclose. They claim Mr Kushner omitted some documents that mentioned individuals who were connected to the Russia inquiry. The senators are also are seeking his phone records. ""If, as you suggest, Mr Kushner was unaware of, for example, any attempts at Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, then presumably there would be few communications concerning many of the persons identified,"" the senators wrote. The letter also asked for any communications between Mr Kushner and ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn, who was forced to resign in February after he admitted to lying to Vice-President Mike Pence about a meeting with a Russian envoy. The two leaders discussed the Russian interference allegations at an Asia-Pacific summit in Vietnam Mr Kushner's lawyer has until 27 November to fulfil their request. The two senators said Mr Kushner has yet to hand over promised transcripts from his interviews with both the Senate and House intelligence committees, which are also investigating Russia's role in last year's election and allegations of collusion involving Mr Trump's campaign. 18 revelations from Wikileaks emails Russia's 'cyber war' against the West US intelligence agencies believe Russia tried to help Mr Trump win the presidency by hacking and releasing emails damaging to his opponent, Hillary Clinton. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied the charges. But the letter comes afterDonald Trump Jr revealed that he had direct communication with WikiLeaksthrough private Twitter messages during the campaign. Special counsel Robert Mueller is also leading an independent investigation into whether there were any links between Russia and the Trump campaign. Both deny there was any collusion. Last month, former Trump campaign adviserGeorge Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to having lied to the FBIabout the timing of meetings with alleged go-betweens for Russia. Mr Trump's former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, and an associate were also placed under house arrest on charges of money laundering as a result of the Mueller inquiry, but the charges do not relate to the election.

Davis: We have compromised in EU talks,"This video can not be played David Davis: ""Nothing comes for nothing"" in negotiations David Davis has said the EU must be willing to give ground too if further progress in Brexit talks is to be made. He told the BBC the UK has ""been offering some creative compromises and not always got them back"", insisting that ""nothing comes for nothing"". Many EU countries want to move on in the talks because they can see how important it is to their economies, he told political editor Laura Kuenssberg. But he said this needed support from 27 nations, including Germany and France. The EU says negotiations cannot move on to trade until questions about the UK ""divorce bill"", citizens' rights and Northern Ireland are resolved. Kuenssberg: Can 'bad cop' Davis reboot talks? Irish demand post-Brexit border promise Three things you need to know about talks Katya Adler: Parallel universes of UK and EU negotiators All you need to know about Brexit Theresa May is set to discuss Brexit with EU Council president Donald Tusk later on the margins of a jobs summit in Sweden amid growing pressure for a breakthrough before the end of the year. Downing Street has insisted an earlier meeting with Irish prime minister Leo Varadkar had been ""constructive"" despite the two countries appearing to be no closer to bridging the differences between them. Dublin wants binding guarantees there will be no return to a hard border with Northern Ireland after the UK's exit and Mr Varadkar has indicated he is prepared to ""wait for further concessions"". Arriving for the event in Gothenburg, he said the UK's verbal assurances that there would be no physical infrastructure at the border were not sufficient. Despite the smiles, Leo Varadkar and Theresa May have real differences over the Irish border ""I think it would be in all of our interests that we proceed to phase two in December,"" he said. ""But...sometimes it doesn't seem like they've thought all of this through."" UK Brexit secretary David Davis said he had already made concessions in areas such as the right of EU citizens to vote in local elections in the UK among other things. In a speech in Berlin on Thursday, he warned against ""putting politics above prosperity"" in Britain's post-Brexit relationship with the EU. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mr Davis's speech was delivered politely but implied ""pretty significant frustrations on the UK side with the EU's attitude"". The Brexit Secretary, she added, had not offered anything specific - including on what the EU regards as the vital issue of money - in his speech to ""move things on"". This video can not be played Davis: Other countries see the ""big benefit"" in future Brexit deal. Asked about reports Germany and France were standing in the way of the next phase of talks, Mr Davis said they clearly had the most influence but it was a decision for all 27 and ""many of them do want to move on"". ""It is very important to them, countries like Denmark, countries Holland, like Italy and Spain, countries like Poland can see there are big benefits in the future deal we are talking about."" He suggested there needed to be more give-and-take from the other side. ""I want them to compromise, surprise surprise, nothing comes for nothing in this world,"" he said. ""But so far, in this negotiation, we have made a lot of compromises. On the citizens' rights front, we have made all the running."" As he met his British counterpart Boris Johnson in Dublin, Irish foreign minister Simon Coveney said the two sides were ""not in place right now"" to begin talking about future relations. The Dutch are among those who want trade talks to begin, the UK has said Mr Coveney has floated the idea of a post-Brexit transition period of four or five years to allow both sides to adjust to the changes required. This would be twice as long as that envisaged by the UK government - which wants an implementation phase of around two years. Mr Johnson said while he understood the need to give maximum reassurance to businesses, he thought ""it was possible to do this within a much shorter timescale"", adding that ""we want to get on as fast as possible with the meat of the negotiations"". After a week dominated by talk of a potential Tory rebellion against attempts to fix the precise time of Brexit in the EU Withdrawal Bill, Mr Davis has suggested he will listen to concerns before it is voted on next month. Up to 20 Tory MPs are reported to be opposed to the move as they fear it could tie the hands of British negotiators if talks drag on to the last minute. Mr Davis told the BBC that setting the exact moment of Brexit - 23.00 GMT on 29th March 2019 - in law was a ""good idea"" but he would not pre-empt what ""form"" this would take. ""The whole of this bill is going to be debated through the House,"" he said. ""And there are parts which will change as we go through, undoubtedly. We'll debate it, we'll see where we go."" But No 10 suggested it would not back down, urging all MPs to support a move which it said would ""provide certainty over our position that we are leaving the EU"".

'Don't put politics above prosperity',"Mr Davis laughed off a question about the UK being prepared to pay 60bn euros for financial obligations David Davis has warned against ""putting politics above prosperity"" in Britain's post-Brexit relationship with the EU. In a speech in Berlin, the UK's Brexit Secretary outlined his hopes for a deal that ""allows for the freest possible trade in goods and services"". He also said he thought it ""incredibly unlikely"" there would be no deal. The EU says negotiations cannot move on to trade until questions about the UK ""divorce bill"", citizens' rights and Northern Ireland are resolved. All you need to know about Brexit Who does UK trade with on WTO rules? BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Mr Davis's speech was delivered politely but implied ""pretty significant frustrations on the UK side with the EU's attitude"". In a question and answer session following the speech, a German interviewer got a round of applause for suggesting the UK government looked to be ""in chaos"". Mr Davis replied: ""One of the issues in modern politics is that all governments have periods of turbulence. ""This is a period of turbulence, it will pass."" In his speech to an economic conference organised by the German newspaper SÃ¼ddeutsche Zeitung, he said trade between Germany and the UK was worth 176bn euros a year or ""more than a thousand euros to every man, woman and child in each of our countries"". He said the ""close economic ties"" with the EU ""should continue, if not strengthen"" after Brexit, and he warned: ""Putting politics above prosperity is never a smart choice"". The UK was seeking a ""deep and comprehensive free trade agreement"" of a scope the EU had never seen before as well as ""continued close co-operation in highly regulated areas such as transport, energy and data"", he said. Britain would use an independent trade policy to lead a ""race to the top on quality and standards"" rather than engage in a ""race to the bottom"" that would mean lower standards, he told the audience. He said the EU and UK needed to ""think creatively"" about their post-Brexit relationship but stressed the need for a ""time limited transition period"" to implement the new arrangements. ""And that would mean access to the UK and European markets would continue on current terms. Keeping both the rights of a European Union member and the obligations of one, such as the role of the European Court of Justice. ""That also means staying in all the EU regulators and agencies during that limited period. Which would be about two years."" He added that tariff-free trade should be maintained and there must be an ""effective dispute mechanism"" for any disputes that may arise, that should be neither the UK courts, nor the European Court of Justice. ""It must be appropriate for both sides so that it can give business the confidence it needs that this partnership will endure."" In a question and answer session following his speech, Mr Davis laughed off a question about whether the UK would be prepared to pay 60bn euros to settle its financial obligations. He said the UK's aim was that ""nobody will have to pay more ... nobody will receive less"" but would not give a figure that the UK would be prepared to pay. Asked if he thought the Brexit negotiations would end in ""no deal"", he said: ""I think that's incredibly unlikely."" While the UK government has not put a figure on the amount it is prepared to pay to settle the UK's obligations but it has been estimated at 20bn euros (about Â£18bn). The Sun newspaper reported on Thursday that the prime minister was preparing to offer an additional Â£20bn to the EU to clear the way for talks about a transitional and future trade deal. Downing Street described that as ""yet more speculation"". EU sources told the BBC last week that the UK had only two weeks left to make progress on the so-called withdrawal issues, including the amount the UK will pay as it leaves and Mr Davis's EU counterpart Michel Barnier said ""time is pressing"" to get agreement on the bill.

Tesla unveils first electric truck,"This video can not be played WATCH: See the new Tesla Semi and Roadster Tesla has unveiled its first electric articulated lorry, designed to challenge diesel trucks as king of the road. The long-anticipated Tesla Semi has a range of 500 miles on a single charge. Tesla says the vehicle - known in the US as a semi-trailer truck - will go into production in 2019. Chief executive Elon Musk also unexpectedly revealed a new Roadster, which he said would be ""the fastest production car ever"" made. The red sports car was driven out of the trailer of the electric lorry during Tesla's presentation on Thursday. The Roadster will have a range of close to 1,000km (620 miles) on a single charge and will do 0-100mph in 4.2 seconds. Mr Musk described it as ""a hardcore smackdown to gasoline cars"". He said riding in traditional cars would be like driving ""a steam engine with a side of quiche"". The new Roadster becomes available in 2020. The Tesla Semi  will achieve 0-60mph in 20 seconds when pulling 36,287kgs (80,000lbs), the maximum allowed on US roads. Speaking on stage at Tesla's facility in Los Angeles, chief executive Elon Musk said: ""It's not like any truck that you've ever driven."" However, the charismatic Mr Musk faces continued pressure from investors and customers as the firm struggles to meet demand for its Model 3 car. The Model 3 is behind schedule due to factory delays, a situation Mr Musk described recently as âproduction hellâ. The 46-year-old had been camping at Teslaâs Gigafactory in Reno, Nevada,  to oversee battery production for the new cars. However, while the company had predicted it would make 1,500 Model 3 cars in the third quarter of 2017, in reality it only managed 260. Tesla said it won't reach its production target of 5,000 Model 3 cars per week until 2018 Depending on your opinion of Mr Musk, launching a new truck at this time is either a bold statement of belief in his technology, and business as usual, or a foolish distraction from Teslaâs main goal of making its Model 3 a mainstream, affordable car. There are elements of the Model 3 in the Tesla Semi. Each of its wheels is powered by a Model 3 motor, and the cab features two of the touch screens displays found in the Model 3. With Tesla Semi, Mr Musk enters a competitive, demanding market. There are an estimated 3.5 million truck drivers in the US, the vast majority of whom drive diesel-powered engines. Tesla will not be able to compete on dieselâs range, and battery specialists doubt Tesla can produce a powerful enough battery at a reasonable price. âA 300-mile-capable battery pack costs about $200,000,â a Carnegie Mellon study concluded. âWhich is much higher than a diesel-powered semi-truck, which costs about $120,000, on average, for the entire vehicle.â Mr Musk said the Tesla Semi would be able to travel 643km (400 miles) after 30 minutes of charge at one of Tesla's new mega-chargers. As for cost, the company said that per mile the Tesla Semi would work out cheaper than a diesel equivalent when fuel and other maintenance is taken into consideration - but did not share the cost of an individual truck. The Diesel Technology Forum, a non-profit trade group that promotes the use of diesel, said Teslaâs announcement needed to be ""evaluated in the context of realityâ. ""Diesel is the most energy efficient internal combustion engine,â Allen Schaeffer, the forum's executive director. ""It has achieved dominance as the technology of choice in the trucking industry over many decades and challenges from many other fuel types. ""Still, today, diesel offers a unique combination of unmatched features: proven fuel efficiency, economical operation, power, reliability, durability, availability, easy access to fuelling and service facilities, and now near-zero emissions performance."" As well as coming up against diesel incumbents, Tesla also faces other electric rivals. Concept electric big rigs have been unveiled by Daimler, Volkswagen and Cummins - though all fall short on range, and none are currently on the roads. Where Tesla believes it can bring an added advantage is with on-board safety and comfort. A statement from Tesla boasted that âjackknifing is prevented due to the Semi's onboard sensors that detect instability and react with positive or negative torque to each wheel while independently actuating all brakes"". ""The surround cameras aid object detection and minimise blind spots, automatically alerting the driver to safety hazards and obstacles. ""With Enhanced Autopilot, the Tesla Semi features Automatic Emergency Braking, Automatic Lane Keeping and Lane Departure Warning.â Autopilot is Teslaâs autonomous driving function that offers several self-driving features, most importantly guiding the vehicle to stay within the lines on the road, and slowing down in keeping with traffic up ahead.

Sky Bet extends EFL sponsorship deal,"Sky Bet has extended its multi-million pound sponsorship deal with the English Football League until the summer of 2024. The gambling operation is the headline sponsor for the Championship, League One and League Two football divisions. It gets its logo on shirts, and rights for ""Bet and Watch"" for some matches. Sky Bet says it will try to discourage problem gambling through messaging on shirts, and that clubs will benefit through more money. The deal, which is worth tens of millions of pounds, has been in place since 2013. Sky Bet said it would be paying 20% more than it has done so far to extend the agreement from 2019 to 2024. This will make the 11-year deal one of the longest in professional sport, the firm said. The Leeds-based operation, which includes sites such as Sky Vegas and Sky Bingo,is owned by private equity group CVC Capital Partners,external. Broadcaster Sky holds a 20% stake in the firm. The betting industry has been under increasing scrutiny from the government, and from the regulator, the Gambling Commission. Earlier this year the Football Association, English football's governing body, announced it would end sponsorship deals with gambling firms. However, competition organisers, and the clubs themselves, are free to take sponsorship from gambling firms. The money from the Sky Bet deal will be divided among the 72 clubs in the English Football League, which covers the three divisions below the Premier League. The chief executive of Sky Bet, Richard Flint toldthe BBC's Wake up to Money podcastthat the English Football League used the revenue generated to help them run their day-to-day operations. He said: ""Without sponsorship from the betting industry there aren't a great number of sponsors willing to get involved in football."" However, there are fears that increasing numbers of young fans are being exposed to gambling adverts. One of the findings of the BBC's annual Price of Football survey was that more young football fans bet on games than play the sport. About 95% of TV ad breaks in live football matchesfeature at least one gambling advert,the BBC found in October. In some matches, 40% of the adverts were for gambling. Mr Flint told the BBC that Sky Bet and the English Football League were actively promoting awareness about problem gambling as part of the ""When the fun stops. Stop"" campaign. ""From the play offs and including next season every shirt will have a responsible gambling message on the shirt sleeve and we're tying that into a responsible gambling campaign starting today, which includes a TV advert and perimeter boards at EFL games,"" he said The ""When the fun stops. Stop"" campaign is orchestrated by the Senet Group, which was established in 2014 by some of Britain's leading bookmakers in response to public concerns about gambling and gambling addiction. The head of the GambleAware charity, Marc Etches, said that while it welcomed a commitment to do more to promote safer gambling, ""the messaging needs to be much more explicit about the risk involved than what the gambling industry currently proposes"".

Mafia boss 'Toto' Riina dies aged 87,"""Toto"" Riina was finally captured in 1993 Notorious Sicilian Mafia ""boss of all bosses"" Salvatore ""Toto"" Riina has died from cancer in jail, aged 87. Riina was serving 26 life sentences and is believed to have ordered more than 150 murders. The head of the feared Cosa Nostra spent nearly a quarter of a century on the run before being jailed in 1993. He ordered more murders from jail. As well as kidney cancer, he was said to have been suffering from a heart condition and Parkinson's disease. Riina had been in a medically induced coma and his family had been given special permission to visit him in the prisoners' wing of the hospital in Parma, northern Italy. No Italy 'baby bonus' for Mafia boss's daughter Lucia Riina Mafia boss's son's interview sparks fury in Italy The secret lives of the Mafia hunters Riina was born in 1930 to poor farmers in Corleone, Sicily - the birthplace of Don Corleone, the fictional Godfather in Francis Ford Coppola's film trilogy. His father was killed when he was 13 and at 19 he joined the local Mafia, committing murder to gain entry. He spent six years in prison. When he got out, he helped local mobster Luciano Leggio kill Corleone's Mafia boss. Along with childhood friend Bernardo Provenzano, he then led a hit squad targeting Mafia boss Michele ""the Cobra"" Cavataio in Palermo, giving the Corleone clan a foothold in the Sicilian capital. When Leggio was arrested in 1974, Riina became boss. Under his leadership, the clan came to dominate the Cosa Nostra crime group in the 1970s, as its fortunes blossomed, buoyed by a booming trade trafficking heroin to North America. He was a wanted man, but evaded justice for 24 years, remaining all the while on the island of Sicily. The Mafia is notorious for brutality, but Riina was the most savage of all, earning him the nickname ""The Beast"". ""He was the fiercest and the nastiest mobster in the mafia probably in history,"" Francesco Bongarra, a journalist with Italian news agency Ansa, told the BBC. Judge Giovanni Falcone, second from left, earned Riina's wrath by jailing scores of mafiosos in the 1980s The judge was killed in a 1992 bombing that left this wreckage of a police car - ordered by Riina While his cruelty propelled him up the ranks it was also key to his downfall, and to a pivotal point in Mafia relations with the Italian state. In 1981, Riina began a two-year drive dubbed ""The Slaughter"" to eliminate his rivals, causing many mobsters to fear for their own lives and those of their families. Many broke their code of silence and began to co-operate with investigators, resulting in a breakthrough case which saw hundreds of mafiosos convicted. Riina did not take this lying down. In 1992, within two months the two leading judges in the case, Giovanni Falcone and Paolo Borsellino, had been blown up. But six months later, Riina was arrested. What has happened since his incarceration? In detention, Riina's savagery continued. He ordered the murder of a 13-year-old boy kidnapped to try to prevent his father revealing information about the Mafia. The boy was strangled and his body dissolved in acid. And, partly in protest at his arrest, his associates carried out a series of bombings in Rome, Milan and Florence in 1993, leaving 10 people dead. Riina had been imprisoned under the ""Article 41-bis prison regime"" imposing tight security measures on Mafiosos intended to completely cut off prisoners from their criminal contacts. In his final days in jail, Riina was recorded saying he ""regrets nothing"" The regime includes strictly limited visits from his family. Petitions for him to be released into house arrest for his last days were met with angry protests from the relatives of some of his many victims. Earlier this year, Riina was recorded on a wiretap saying he ""regrets nothing... They'll never break me, even if they give me 3,000 years"" in jail, reported AFP news agency. And indeed he has never broken his silence. Riina leaves behind a wife, Antonietta, and four children, including his eldest son, Giovanni, who is serving a life sentence in jail for four murders.

"Third murder arrest over missing GaiaThe man is believed to be known to the teenager, who has been missing from Swanage since 7 November.12h12 hours agoDorset","This video can not be played Det Supt Paul Kessell said the 49-year-old is believed to be known to Gaia Police investigating the disappearance of teenager Gaia Pope have arrested a 49-year-old man on suspicion of murder. Paul Elsey, confirmed as the suspect to the BBC by his father, is from the Swanage area of Dorset. Mr Elsey, the third person to be held in the inquiry, is believed to be known to 19-year-old Gaia, who went missing from the town on Tuesday, 7 November. A search is continuing in an area where items of women's clothing were found earlier, Dorset Police said. Mr Elsey lives at the same property as his mother Rosemary Dinch, 71, who along with her 19-year-old grandson, Nathan Elsey, were arrested on suspicion of murdering Ms Pope on Monday. The pair were released on Tuesday while inquiries continue. Gaia Pope was last seen in Swanage on 7 November Det Supt Paul Kessell said the clothing was found on land near the Dorset coast path and ""a number of vehicles"" had also been seized. The officer said it was not clear who the clothes belonged to but they were ""similar"" to those which Gaia was wearing. Forensic officers are working in the area where items of clothing were found He added Gaia's family had been informed of the developments and were being supported. She was last seen nine days ago by family friend Ms Dinch in Swanage. Since Gaia's disappearance, extensive searches have been carried out in and around the resort, involving police, coastguard teams and local volunteers. Asked why the latest suspect had been arrested on suspicion of murder, Mr Kessell said: ""As you would expect, we have been conducting this inquiry for two weeks and it is our responsibility to investigate every avenue of inquiry that's open to us. ""In doing that, we continue to investigate whether Gaia has come to harm through an act of crime or whether she is missing and we will continue to do so."" He appealed directly to the public to come forward if they have any information or have had any contact with Gaia since she went missing. Police cordoned off an area of land, north of the coast path after items of women's clothing were found Gaia, who has severe epilepsy, is thought to have gone missing without her medication. Earlier, her father Richard Sutherland told the BBC the support from the community in the search had been ""heart warming"". ""It's been beautiful, it keeps us going. To feel that strength of everyone helping us - every bit of help is gratefully received and she's worth every bit of it,"" he said. On Wednesday police released CCTV images of Gaia at a petrol station shortly before she went missing.

Jared Kushner 'withheld WikiLeaks emails'Senators say Mr Kushner received emails about WikiLeaks in 2016 that he forwarded to the Trump team.3h3 hours agoUS & Canada,"White House senior aide Jared Kushner failed to disclose emails he received about WikiLeaks and ""a Russian backdoor overture"" in 2016, senators have said. Two senators sent Mr Kushner a letter demanding additional documents as part of an ongoing investigation into Russia's alleged election meddling. The lawmakers said they became aware of the documents through other witnesses. A lawyer for Mr Kushner, Donald Trump's son-in-law, said he was ""open to responding to any additional requests"". Senate Judiciary committee chairman Senator Charles Grassley, a Republican, and Senator Diane Feinstein, top Democrat on the panel, wrote that the emails were omitted from documents Mr Kushner was asked to turn over last month. ""We appreciate your voluntary cooperation with the Committee's investigation, but the production appears to have been incomplete,"" they wrote in a letter on Thursday to his attorney, Abbe Lowell. Mr Lowell said in a statement his client provided ""all relevant documents that had to do with Mr Kushner's calls, contacts or meetings with Russians during the campaign and transition, which was the request"". The pair claim Mr Kushner, who is married to President Trump's daughter Ivanka, received emails concerning WikiLeaks as well as ""documents concerning a 'Russia back door overture and dinner invite'"", which he forwarded to other campaign officials. Russia-Trump: Who's who in the drama to end all dramas? The 'cloud' over the Trump White House The Senate panel said there are ""several documents that are known to exist"" because other witnesses provided documents which Mr Kushner was copied on, but did not disclose. They claim Mr Kushner omitted some documents that mentioned individuals who were connected to the Russia inquiry. The senators are also are seeking his phone records. ""If, as you suggest, Mr Kushner was unaware of, for example, any attempts at Russian interference in the 2016 presidential election, then presumably there would be few communications concerning many of the persons identified,"" the senators wrote. The letter also asked for any communications between Mr Kushner and ex-national security adviser Michael Flynn, who was forced to resign in February after he admitted to lying to Vice-President Mike Pence about a meeting with a Russian envoy. The two leaders discussed the Russian interference allegations at an Asia-Pacific summit in Vietnam Mr Kushner's lawyer has until 27 November to fulfil their request. The two senators said Mr Kushner has yet to hand over promised transcripts from his interviews with both the Senate and House intelligence committees, which are also investigating Russia's role in last year's election and allegations of collusion involving Mr Trump's campaign. 18 revelations from Wikileaks emails Russia's 'cyber war' against the West US intelligence agencies believe Russia tried to help Mr Trump win the presidency by hacking and releasing emails damaging to his opponent, Hillary Clinton. The Kremlin has repeatedly denied the charges. But the letter comes afterDonald Trump Jr revealed that he had direct communication with WikiLeaksthrough private Twitter messages during the campaign. Special counsel Robert Mueller is also leading an independent investigation into whether there were any links between Russia and the Trump campaign. Both deny there was any collusion. Last month, former Trump campaign adviserGeorge Papadopoulos pleaded guilty to having lied to the FBIabout the timing of meetings with alleged go-betweens for Russia.

Credit card limits 'need control',"More than a million credit card users who are struggling financially have had their credit limits increased without asking, a charity has said. Such borrowing could make their financial problems worse, so Citizens Advice is calling for a ban on unsolicited increases in credit card limits. It wants Chancellor Philip Hammond to include such a move in the Budget. But providers say protection is being improved.

Credit card limits 'need control'More than a million struggling credit card users have had their credit limits increased without asking.4h4 hours agoBusiness,"More than a million credit card users who are struggling financially have had their credit limits increased without asking, a charity has said. Such borrowing could make their financial problems worse, so Citizens Advice is calling for a ban on unsolicited increases in credit card limits. It wants Chancellor Philip Hammond to include such a move in the Budget. But providers say protection is being improved.

'Disabled Airbnb' bought by AirbnbA London firm set up to help people with disabilities find appropriate accommodation is bought by Airbnb.,"Srin Madipalli says struggling to cope with inappropriate accommodation was ""humiliating and embarrassing"" A London firm sparked by two disabled people's frustration at hotels' inaccurate information on accessibility has been bought by Airbnb. Accomable was founded by two friends with spinal muscular atrophy in 2015. Former corporate lawyer Srin Madipalli came up with the idea after he quit his job to travel the world and found it difficult to find appropriate hotels. ""You'd turn up to places and the shower was tiny or there was a step to get in. It's just really humiliating,"" he says. He persuaded childhood friend Martyn Sibley to join him, and together they created a website aimed at making it easier for disabled people to travel. Like Airbnb, home owners are able to rent out rooms or entire properties via the website which only shows places which have step-free access and detailed information on accessibility adaptations. Airbnb said,externalAccomable would now be wound down over the next few months, with the listings incorporated into its own website, It said that the firm's  founders and most of its seven-person staff would stay on and help Airbnb improve the accuracy of its accessibility listings. ""While we have rules that prohibit discrimination against people with disabilities and an Open Doors policy that helps ensure everyone can find a place to stay, it's clear that we can do more to effectively serve people with disabilities,"" Airbnb said. The rental website said it was already working on new ""accessibility needs"" checklists for hosts. Most of Accomable's staff will now move to work for Airbnb Airbnb didn't say how much it had paid for Accomable, but Mr Madipalli said the sale would enable it to finally meet customers' demands. He said up until now the website had not had enough cash or staff, meaning it could only fulfil about 5 to 10% of booking requests. ""We see the need every day, which is why we wanted to team up with a bigger player,"" Mr Madipalli said. And the other change, Mr Madipalli said was that he would now start using Airbnb himself. Up until now the lack of wheelchair-accessible rentals had stopped him. ""But I look forward to trying it out,"" he says.

Reality Check: Zimbabwe's false rumours,"After reports emerged of the military seizing control in Zimbabwe, social media was full of stories about what was happening during a stunning 24 hours, but not all were accurate. Robert Mugabe, the country's leader for more than three decades, was put under house arrest, and he wasn't the only government figure to be swept up in the military's action. The Finance Minister, Ignatius Chombo, had also been detained,a government source told the Reuters news agency,external. And it's beenreported,externalthat one Zimbabwean MP told al-Jazeera that $10m (Â£7.5m) had been recovered from Mr Chombo's house. This claim of a vast stash of cash in the home a politician in poverty-stricken Zimbabwe sparked anger in some corners of the online press, but it also led to the use of incorrect photos.

Transport boss hit by Southern delays,"Delays on Southern services have disrupted commuters in the south east London's deputy mayor for transport struggles to get to early morning meetings because of disruption on Southern Rail, documents reveal. Val Shawcross's office said in an email that ""Val is a morning person but has to use Southern trains to get in to the office so we try not to have too many early starts"". Southern Rail has refused to comment. The train operator has been hit by repeated strikes and its ownersfined over its poor performance. The documents were revealed to the BBC under a Freedom of Information act request. Val Shawcross was unable to schedule early meetings due to Southern Rail disruptions A City Hall spokesman said: ""The deputy mayor for transport works her socks off to make the capital's transport network more affordable, reliable and accessible for all Londoners. ""Under Sadiq [Khan] and Val, TfL passengers have enjoyed frozen fares and seen a nearly 60 per cent reduction in the number of days lost to strikes. ""If the government shared their drive and gave TfL control of more suburban lines, rail passengers too would get the service they deserve."" Ms Shawcross did not comment personally. The email was among correspondence sent in September from Ms Shawcross's office to public relations firm Newington Communications, which was arranging a meeting between the deputy mayor and Licensed Taxi Drivers' Association (LTDA) general secretary Steve McNamara. The emails revealed that Sadiq Khan said he was too busy to meet Mr McNamara in June and arranged for him to meet Ms Shawcross instead. Ms Shawcross told the LTDA that she was unable to discuss the Uber relicensing decision with it, which it had requested to do, because doing so with a third party would prejudice TfL's role as regulator. On legal advice, she delayed the meeting until after the licensing decision. TfL took thedecision to withhold a new licence from Uberearlier this year.

"Third murder arrest over missing GaiaThe man is believed to be known to the teenager, who has been missing from Swanage since 7 November.7h7 hours agoDorset","This video can not be played Det Supt Paul Kessell said the 49-year-old is believed to be known to Gaia Police investigating the disappearance of teenager Gaia Pope have arrested a 49-year-old man on suspicion of murder. Paul Elsey, confirmed as the suspect to the BBC by his father, is from the Swanage area of Dorset. Mr Elsey, the third person to be held in the inquiry, is believed to be known to 19-year-old Gaia, who went missing from the town on Tuesday, 7 November. A search is continuing in an area where items of women's clothing were found earlier, Dorset Police said. Mr Elsey lives at the same property as his mother Rosemary Dinch, 71, who along with her 19-year-old grandson, Nathan Elsey, were arrested on suspicion of murdering Ms Pope on Monday. The pair were released on Tuesday while inquiries continue. Gaia Pope was last seen in Swanage on 7 November Det Supt Paul Kessell said the clothing was found on land near the Dorset coast path and ""a number of vehicles"" had also been seized. The officer said it was not clear who the clothes belonged to but they were ""similar"" to those which Gaia was wearing. Forensic officers are working in the area where items of clothing were found He added Gaia's family had been informed of the developments and were being supported. She was last seen nine days ago by family friend Ms Dinch in Swanage. Since Gaia's disappearance, extensive searches have been carried out in and around the resort, involving police, coastguard teams and local volunteers. Asked why the latest suspect had been arrested on suspicion of murder, Mr Kessell said: ""As you would expect, we have been conducting this inquiry for two weeks and it is our responsibility to investigate every avenue of inquiry that's open to us. ""In doing that, we continue to investigate whether Gaia has come to harm through an act of crime or whether she is missing and we will continue to do so."" He appealed directly to the public to come forward if they have any information or have had any contact with Gaia since she went missing. Police cordoned off an area of land, north of the coast path after items of women's clothing were found Gaia, who has severe epilepsy, is thought to have gone missing without her medication. Earlier, her father Richard Sutherland told the BBC the support from the community in the search had been ""heart warming"". ""It's been beautiful, it keeps us going. To feel that strength of everyone helping us - every bit of help is gratefully received and she's worth every bit of it,"" he said. On Wednesday police released CCTV images of Gaia at a petrol station shortly before she went missing.

Apology after train departs seconds early,"Japan has one of the world's most reliable railways and is known for its Shinkansen bullet trains (pictured) A rail company in Japan has apologised after one of its trains departed 20 seconds early. Management on the Tsukuba Express line between Tokyo and the city of Tsukuba say they ""sincerely apologise for the inconvenience"" caused. In a statement,the company said the train had been scheduled to leave at 9:44:40 local time but left at 9:44:20.,external Many social media users reacted to the company's apology with surprise.

The mistake happened because staff had not checked the timetable, the company statement said. ""The crew did not sufficiently check the departure time and performed the departure operation,"" it said. Cats invited on to local Japan train It added that no customers had complained about the early departure from Minami Nagareyama Station, which is just north of Tokyo. The Tsukuba Express line takes passengers from Akihabara in eastern Tokyo to Tsukuba in about 45 minutes. It is rare for trains in Japan, which has one of the world's most reliable railways, to depart at a different time to the one scheduled. The country's Tokaido line, which runs from Tokyo to the city of Kobe, is by far the world's busiest and carries nearly 150 million passengers a year.

Eviction threat over crying babyA family renting in London are threatened with eviction after complaints over a crying baby.4m4 minutes agoFamily & Education,"The Wurth family were told they might be evicted because their baby was crying A family renting in London have been threatened with eviction after complaints that their baby was crying. They were warned by the management firm that if the noise went on they could be given ""two weeks' notice to vacate"". The parents, with a 15-month-old daughter and a three-year-old son, say it is ""horrible discrimination"" against families renting with children. The management firm said neighbours were being disturbed by noisy children and ""other noise nuisance"". Neighbours had complained ""on a daily basis"" and the other tenants had a right not to be troubled by noise, the company said. Attila and Ildiko Wurth, with their two young children, are living in a privately rented top-floor flat in a converted house in Hammersmith, west London. They say they were shaken to receive an email from the managing agent, saying there had been a ""complaint stating that at 5.30am this morning a baby was crying and stamping and then further noise starting again at 6.45am, which woke one of the other tenants in the property"". ""We have subsequently liaised with your landlord and are instructed that we are to agree arrangements with you to vacate the property as soon as possible."" This video can not be played Attila Wurth says the family was shocked and upset by the idea of being evicted Attila says they were shocked by this ""heartless and harsh"" attitude and deeply upset by the idea of being thrown out of their home. Another email said there had been further complaints and ""if this continues we will have no choice but to issue a Section 8 notice, which will give you two weeks' notice to vacate"". The Wurths were told: ""Please ensure to keep all movement and noise to a minimum."" Uncertain about what to do next, they sought advice and were directed towards a housing helpline, which they said was always engaged. In the end it was social media that got them some support, putting their problem on to Facebook. ""We felt so scared. We didn't know what happens next. Will we come home and find our things in the road?"" Rising numbers of families are now living long-term in rented accommodation. While once couples with children might have bought their own place, more are renting into their 30s and 40s - and the case highlights the pressures facing ""generation rent"". Attila works as a vet, but says the couple can't afford to buy in London. ""We pay our own way, but we have no more to spare. ""You have to be extremely rich to have children in London,"" he says. The local authority, Hammersmith and Fulham, says that about a third of the residents in the borough are private renters. This year it extended a licensing scheme to try to give private renters more protection and to ensure their legal rights. The email to the Wurths warns of a ""Section 8"" eviction - referring to the Housing Act of 1988, which would allow a landlord to remove tenants before the end of their tenancy agreement. The housing charity Shelter says this would require grounds such as not paying rent, anti-social behaviour or a breach of the tenancy agreement. More families like the Wurths are staying in rented accommodation This could include being a ""nuisance"" to neighbours - but a court would have to decide whether such claims were reasonable. ""We have been very careful about noise,"" says Attila. But if landlords rent to a family with young children, he says, it is unrealistic to think that a baby won't cry sometimes. ""We don't even have a stereo or a TV to make noise with - and we have avoided making any noise with household activities,"" says Attila. The managing agent, Sheraton Management Ltd, says the Wurths ""were in breach of contract as they were causing disturbance to the other occupants of the building... not only relating to noisy children, but also other noise nuisance"". The agent says there had been ""banging, stamping, loud footsteps"". ""Reluctantly, as there was no remission in the problem, it was on this basis that we advised Mrs Wurth that we may be left with no alternative but to serve a notice for possession,"" it says. The management company says it has a responsibility to other tenants in the building - and to claims ""that their contractual right to quiet enjoyment has been breached"". Sheraton's statement says: ""We manage numerous properties lived in by families, some with very young children. Our policy is always to avoid the necessity for repossession proceedings."" The Wurths are waiting to hear what will happen next.

"Car tax evasion triples after disc scrappedThe government potentially lost out on Â£107m from 755,000 unlicensed vehicles in the past year, data shows.11h11 hours agoBusinessComments","The number of unlicensed vehicles on the road has tripled since the paper tax disc was abolished, government figures show. The data, published every two years, shows that the government potentially lost out on Â£107m from 755,000 unlicensed vehicles last year. The RAC said the decision to get rid of the paper tax disc three years ago has proved ""costly"". The measure was meant to have saved the Treasury Â£10m a year, the RAC said. Figures from the Department for Transport show that 1.8% of vehicles were unlicensed in 2017 compared with 0.6% on 2013. ""The principle of abolishing the tax disc to introduce greater efficiencies has, so far, evidently failed,"" said RAC public affairs manager Nicholas Lyes. ""It appears that having a visual reminder was an effective way to prompt drivers into renewing their car tax - arguably more drivers are now prepared to try their luck and see if they can get away with not paying any vehicle tax at all, or are simply forgetting to tax their vehicle when they are due to."" When the abolition of the paper tax disc was announced by then-Chancellor, George Osborne, the Treasury said it showed government was moving ""into the modern age"". Officials said the disc, introduced in 1921, was no longer needed with the DVLA and police relying on an electronic register. However, there is clear evidence that it has led to confusion, mistakes or open flouting of the rules by drivers. The RAC said a third of untaxed vehicles had changed hands since September 2016, indicating that many drivers were not aware that tax does not carry over when ownership changes. The DVLA also said that it was running a campaign warning the rising number of people still driving cars that had been declared as off the road to tax their vehicles. The seller receives a refund of any full months of remaining tax while the new owner must tax the vehicle immediately. Just over half had been unlicensed for two months or less, suggesting some of these drivers had forgotten about their renewal date, although reminders are sent before the expiry date by the DVLA. The highest levels of evasion were in the West Midlands (2.1% of vehicles) and the North West of England (2%). The East of England had the lowest rate at 0.8%, with all other areas ranging between 1.6% and 1.8%. These results are based on where vehicles were seen in traffic by enforcement officers or cameras, not where they are registered.
