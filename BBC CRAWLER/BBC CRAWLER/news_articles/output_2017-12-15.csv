Fire death family 'won't be broken',"This video can not be played The children's aunt Claire Pearson shared her memories of them The aunt of four children who died in a house fire in Salford says the family is trying to cope with their grief but ""nothing will ever break us"". Demi Pearson, 15, and siblings Brandon, eight, and Lacie, seven, died in the blaze in Walkden on Monday.  Lia, three, died in hospital on Wednesday. Claire Pearson said: ""What's happened is tragic but it won't separate this family. We are all very close."" Her sister and the children's mother, Michelle, 35, is in hospital in a coma. Two men and a womanappeared in court earlier charged with murdering the siblings.They were remanded in custody until 9 March for a plea and trial preparation hearing. Ms Pearson says her sister is ""an amazing woman"" and the house on Jackson Street ""was like a youth club with the amount of kids"" who would visit. ""She was such a mother to everybody else's kids as well as her own,"" she said. ""When it was family time they'd all cuddle up on the couch together, they were so close. ""Lacie was a little diva, she didn't stop dancing. Lia was obsessed with Peppa Pig. Brandon and Lacie were so close."" The family said they were ""dreading the day"" they have to tell Michelle ""the awful news about her babies"". Lia, Demi, Brandon and Lacie died following Monday's fire, while their mum Michelle is still in a coma Speaking of how the family feels, she said: ""You can't feel pain, you can't feel grief, you can't feel anything, you're so numb inside, it's too much to take in."" Mike Pearson, Michelle's father, said: ""The kids were just like any other kids. They were very supportive, very independent, but very tightly-knit. ""Demi was a little star. She'd been a diabetic and had problems in and out of hospital with that but nothing phased her, she was a beautiful girl. ""Brandon was quite funny, he was more like a school teacher, he was so intelligent."" Mike Pearson said Michelle Pearson is expected to be in a medically-induced coma for the next three or four weeks He described Michelle, who they said was in critical but stable condition, as ""fiercely independent"". ""Michelle would do things her way. She loved her kids to pieces, she'd look after anyone. She was a friend to everyone,"" he said. ""She didn't have a bad word to say about anyone. She had a heart of gold, but she was nobody's fool, she'd stand her corner."" He said the family has recently been to church to pray for her recovery. ""She's so badly burned, she's bandaged from head to foot, she looks like a mummy and she's going to be in the medically-induced coma for the next three or four weeks,"" he said. ""It's going to be a long road but hopefully she'll pull through. Whether she'll have the fight, I don't know. I'm hoping she'll get the strength from somewhere but she's lost all her babies and that's the heartbreaking thing. ""We've got to focus on Michelle and try and be there for her."" Claire Pearson said the house on Jackson Street ""was like a youth club with the amount of kids"" who visited He added he was ""gobsmacked"" at the support the family has received from the local community. ""The outpouring of love and support, it's been overwhelming. People have come from miles to leave flowers and teddy bears and messages of support,"" he said. ""They've been absolutely outstanding.

Disabled man's cancer care criticised,"This video can not be played Ian's family were told he was dying The failure to offer a learning disabled young man cancer treatment has been described as a shocking example of health inequalities by charities. Ian Shaw was sent home to die, but a doctor queried that decision afterseeing his story on the BBC. Ian, 35, who has since been given chemotherapy, is now doing well. The hospital involved has said his learning disabilities had not been a factor in the decision to put him on end-of-life care. Ian has learning disabilities, autism and epilepsy. In December 2016, he was diagnosed with testicular cancer. His parents say they were told by doctors nothing more could be done for him as the cancer had spread too far. In February, he arrived home for what his family believed would be his final few months. Ian, whose behaviour could at times be challenging, spent nearly a decade in secure units, moving between three different places. His family believe in the units he was over-medicated and his health neglected. They had to fight to get him moved to a supported home in the community, it was a few months after the move that the cancer was detected. His parents believe it could have been found the year before when he was treated for a testicular swelling, if there had been a thorough investigation. In July of this year, the BBC reported on Ian's case after it led to a call for the prime minister to appoint a commissioner to champion the rights of people with learning disabilities. Sir Stephen Bubb, who had written two reports for NHS England on secure units, described Ian's case as ""all too typical"" of the continuing failures vulnerable people faced. Dr Justin Wilson was watching the report on the BBC News at Six and Ten. He is a psychiatrist who has also studied treatment of cancer in people with learning disabilities. He asked to be put in touch with the family. Dr Justin Wilson queried Ian's diagnosis He says: ""Knowing that testicular cancer is one of the most treatable cancers that there is, I was surprised that the decision had been made not to provide treatment and I wanted to understand what that was about."" As a result, a second opinion was sought about Ian's treatment. ""My concern was that perhaps judgements were made about the quality of life that he has because of his severe learning disabilities and because of the physical impact of how the cancer has spread,"" says Dr Wilson. ""I'm also clearly aware that providing cancer treatment for someone with the problems that Ian has is a real challenge. ""It is really difficult to give the best possible treatment to somebody in that situation, but my view is those challenges can be overcome."" Ian is now undergoing chemotherapy at the Royal Marsden Hospital - and he is doing well. A scan at the end of November showed after four rounds of chemotherapy the tumour, which had spread to his stomach, had shrunk. Ian's mother, Jan, says: ""Especially when I thought there was no treatment and no cure, it was just a waiting game, but now there is hope."" Watch: Alternatives to the job interview Hundreds of 'restraint injuries' at special schools Patients with learning disabilities missing out on health checks Boost for 1,000 people with learning disability or autism Ian was a patient at Luton and Dunstable Hospital when his family were told last February that he was terminally ill and could not be treated. In a statement, the University Hospital Trust said a course of chemotherapy had been planned but Ian's condition had then worsened. A range of experts had been consulted and it had been decided he had been too ill to undergo treatment. It added: ""The decision was therefore taken, in consultation with his family, to start palliative care. ""The trust can confirm that Mr Shaw's learning difficulties were not a factor in the decision to move to a palliative care pathway."" Ian's family were told he was dying NHS England says it is working to reduce the health inequalities faced by people with learning disabilities. But neither it nor the Department of Health wanted to comment on Ian's case. NHS policy is that reasonable adjustments should be made to ensure that people with learning disabilities get the medical help they need. In Ian's case, he is put under an anaesthetic for a short time while he is given the chemotherapy. The tumour has affected Ian's spine so he is unable to walk, but after 10 months in bed, in November he was moved into a wheelchair. In a joint statement, the charities Mencap and Challenging Behaviour Foundation said: ""We know 1,200 people with a learning disability die every year when their lives could have been saved had they had access to good quality healthcare at the right time. ""Failures to train healthcare professionals on how to support patients with a learning disability and the refusal to involve families in key decisions about their loved one's health continue to contribute to this scandal of unequal health treatment.""

"'Shocking apathy' to fraternity drinkingPenn State allowed ""sadistic"" rituals and failed to protect its students, a blistering report finds.15m16 minutes agoUS & Canada","Several fraternity members are still facing charges related to the death of Tim Piazza (centre) A committee probing the Pennsylvania State University's response to drinking in fraternities has issued a blistering report following a student's death. A grand jury found on Friday that administrators displayed a ""shocking apathy"" to dangerous levels of drinking and hazing in university social clubs. The report claims officials knew of the dangers but did nothing. The report says Tim Piazza, a 19 year old who died last February after binge drinking, ""did not have to die"". Penn State officials have yet to comment on the damning report. The findings say officials ""were aware of the excessive and dangerous alcohol abuse indulged by fraternities, such that it was only a matter of time before a death would occur during a hazing event"". The deadly problem with US fraternities ""The university bears the ultimate responsibility for the failure to supervise the safety of its students involved in the fraternity system,"" the report says, adding that although the university's actions were not themselves illegal, their ""inaction set the table to allow these criminal acts to occur"", which caused Piazza's death. Tim Piazza, from New Jersey, was left unconscious for hours and suffered internal injuries after falling down steps during an initiation ritual. He later died in hospital. Other members of the fraternity waited nearly 12 hours to call an ambulance, and were charged with manslaughter, although the most serious charges were later dropped. Officials say he was fed 18 drinks in a period of one hour and 22 minutes, and that he never obtained the drinks on his own. Hazing at the school, the report found, is ""rampant and pervasive"" and encourages ""sadistic"" rituals that reach ""peaks of depravity"". The jury calls for ""profound changes on college campuses and communities in Pennsylvania"", and for universities to ensure protections for younger students wishing to join fraternities, and sororities - which together are known as campus Greek social life. Other US universities have taken measures recently to protect students who are seeking to join social clubs. On Thursday, a University of Houston fraternity in Texas was indicted for hazing, with officials charging that students were deprived of adequate food, water and sleep during a three-day initiation event. The president of Florida State University told the Associated Press on Thursday that there is currently no timeline for reinstating campus Greek activities there, after they were suspended in November following a student's death.

Pupils' sexual harassment 'isn't banter',"Teachers should be aware of the likelihood that that harassment can spread on social media Sexual harassment or violence at school should never be dismissed as ""banter"", new Department for Education guidance to schools and colleges has stressed. ""Sexting"" explicit images and videos of under-18s is illegal, it says, and girls are the most likely victims. Schools still have a duty to act if incidents outside school are reported. The Women and Equalities Committee described the issuing of the guidance as a ""belated, but critical, step in the right direction"". It adds that more still needs to be done to make sure girls - who are the most likely victims of sexual violence in schools according to the guidance - are ""safe and equal"" at school. Third of teen girls sexually harassed online 'My daughter had to share a classroom with her rapist' The guidance,published on the government's website,externalon Thursday, highlights ""best practice"" but says it is for individual schools and colleges to develop their own policies and procedures. It has alsolaunched a consultation,externalon changes to statutory guidance - which sets out the legal duty on schools and colleges. The new advice stresses that educational establishments should be making clear that sexual attacks and harassment ""will never be tolerated and is not an inevitable part of growing up"", warning that if it is allowed, then it can ""provide an environment that may lead to sexual violence"". Behaviour such as ""grabbing bottoms, breasts and genitalia"" is potentially criminal and must not be permitted, it says. Pupils reporting abuse say they don't feel supported. The advice says those accused of sexual attacks or misbehaviour also need support and may be victims of abuse and trauma themselves. Teachers should consider the ages of the pupils involved in deciding whether behaviour is harmful - particularly if there is more than two years between them, if one child is disabled or physically much smaller. In any case of reported rape, the child accused should be removed from any classes they share with the alleged victim, ""in the best interests of both children"". Schools or colleges should do ""everything they reasonably can to protect the victim from bullying and harassment as a result of any report they have made"". ""Schools and colleges should also consider the potential impact of social media in facilitating the spreading of rumours and exposing victims' identities,"" the guidance says. Child-on-child sex offence reports up Children suffer sex abuse in schools, MPs told The government says a ""whole school approach"" should be taken which might include teaching pupils about healthy and respectful relationships, gender stereotyping, self-esteem and prejudice. Social workers should be alerted if a child has been harmed and rape or assault allegations should be referred to the police. Parents should usually be informed, unless it is considered that this would put pupils at greater risk. BBC Panoramadiscovered that reports of sexual offences on school premises in England and Wales increased from 386 in 2013-14 to 922 in 2016-17, according to 31 police forces - including 225 rapes on school grounds over the four years. In itsreport,externallast year, the Women and Equalities Committee warned that harassment of girls in English schools was being ""accepted as part of daily life"" and must  be acted upon. Its chairman, Maria Miller, said it was important that the new advice was being well promoted: ""It is well over a year since the committee called for the government and schools to make girls' safety an immediate priority and this is a belated, but critical, step in the right direction. ""The advice addresses in detail important issues that we highlighted in our report, including the need to get support from specialist services and recognising the forms that sexual harassment in schools can take."" But she said more long-term work was needed ""so that future generations of girls are safe and equal at school"". For the government, Minister for Children Robert Goodwill said schools and colleges ""should be safe places"".

Met review after rape trial collapse,"Liam Allan had been on bail for two years before his trial collapsed The Met Police is to hold an ""urgent"" review of a rape case after being accused of failing to disclose vital evidence. Liam Allan, 22, was charged with 12 counts of rape and sexual assault but his trial collapsed after police were ordered to hand over phone records. A computer disk containing 40,000 messages revealed the alleged victim pestered Mr Allan for ""casual sex"". Prosecution barrister Jerry Hayes accused police of ""pure incompetence"". The charges against the criminology student were dropped three days into the trial at Croydon Crown Court when Mr Hayes took over the case. It is understood police had looked at thousands of phone messages when reviewing evidence in the case, but had failed to disclose to the prosecution and defence teams messages between the complainant and her friends which cast doubt on the allegations against Mr Allan. The CPS said it offered no evidence in the case on Thursday as there was ""no longer a realistic prospect of conviction"". Mr Allan told the BBC he was ""overwhelmed"" at the moment, adding: ""It's a huge amount of confusion to go from being the villain to being innocent."" He also toldThe Times,externalhe had suffered two years of ""mental torture... I feel betrayed by the system which I had believed would do the right thing â the system I want to work in."" This video can not be played Rape prosecutor: It's just sheer incompetence Mr Hayes said there had very nearly been ""a massive miscarriage of justice"" which could have led to Mr Allan being imprisoned for 12 years and being put on the sex offenders register for life. He said the disk contained information which ""completely blew the prosecution case out of the water"", although he believed the information had not been disclosed because of ""sheer incompetence"". ""The trouble is everyone is under pressure... This is a criminal justice system which is not just creaking, it's about to croak,"" he said. The BBC's Legal Correspondent Clive Coleman said he understood the defence had asked repeatedly for the phone messages to be disclosed, which included details saying how the alleged victim had spoken to friends about how much she enjoyed having sex with Mr Allan. This video can not be played The BBC's legal correspondent Clive Coleman gives his analysis of the case Mr Allan's solicitor Simone Meerabux said when her client was arrested he had told police about the existence of the messages but ""in spite of all that he was charged"". She said prior to the trial the CPS had told them there was ""nothing further to disclose"" and it was only after they reiterated their request on the first day in court that the information was made available. A Met spokesman said the force was ""urgently reviewing this investigation and will be working with the Crown Prosecution Service to understand exactly what has happened in this case. ""The Met understands the concerns that have been raised as a result of this case being dismissed from court and the ongoing review will seek to address those,"" he said. A spokesman for the CPS said: ""In November 2017, the police provided more material in the case of Liam Allan.

Collapsed rape trial accused 'betrayed',"This video can not be played Liam Allan talks about what it is like being falsely accused of rape A man whose rape trial collapsed after detectives failed to disclose vital evidence to the defence said he felt ""betrayed"" by police and the CPS. Liam Allan was charged with 12 counts of rape and sexual assault but his trial collapsed after police were ordered to hand over phone records.

Mr Allan faced a possible jail term of 12 years and being put on the sex offenders register for life had he been found guilty. He said he felt ""pure fear"" when he learned he had been accused of rape but would never be able to understand why the accusations were made. The 22-year-old student had been charged with 12 counts of rape and sexual assault ""There was no possible real gain from it other than destroying somebody else's life...

The man who is always laughing," “Ehe... ehehehehehe... eh-he-he-hee... ahahahahayeee.” The warm, rich, indulgent chuckle of South Africa’s President Jacob Gedleyihlekisa Zuma ripples through a solemn conference chamber in Pretoria. It’s his trademark - a disarming, seemingly unlimited well of good humour, deployed to break the ice, lighten the mood and wrong-foot his opponents. Many people who know him talk of Zuma’s extravagant charm. I remember watching him gleefully bounding on to a stage, one cold night in central Johannesburg in April 2009, to celebrate the election victory that had just elevated him to the post once occupied by President Nelson Mandela. His laughter, his dance moves, his raucous singing - all seemed to promise a new era of confidence and energy for a country finally being led by “one of us” - a charismatic, salt-of-the-earth man rather than his predecessor, the elitist “professor” Thabo Mbeki. Flawed, yes, the cheering crowds might have conceded. But aren’t we all? Redi Tlhabi, writer and broadcaster Today, after nearly a decade as South Africa’s leader, Jacob Zuma’s laughter has turned against him. To many in this country it has become a jarring, charmless cliche - the hollow mirth of a man whose presidency is widely blamed for the corruption, misrule andeconomic stagnation that now afflict a nation. “President Zuma represents a betrayal of the South African dream,” says Sipho Pitanya, a leading critic from within the ANC, the liberation movement that came to power a generation ago after the long struggle against racial apartheid. “Zuma lives up to his middle name. It’s a Zulu name that means, ‘I laugh at you as I destroy you.’ He is brazen and reckless,” says Redi Tlhabi, author of a book about the woman who accused Zuma of rape. And yet others argue that Zuma is a victim of outrageous prejudice, mocked for his lack of education and his rural upbringing - his genuine achievements in government overlooked by a biased “white media” in favour of a relentless focus on his personal failings. Zuma doesn’t have to do anything for him to be disliked. The prejudice is so ingrained” “The accusations against Zuma are clouded by suspicion, by prejudice, by conjecture... spun by a very aggressive media,” says Jessie Duarte, deputy secretary-general of the ANC and a former special assistant to Nelson Mandela. “You have a peasant, with no university degree... Zuma doesn’t have to do anything for him to be disliked. The prejudice is so ingrained,” says the political commentator Prof Sipho Seepe, who has in the past advised the Zuma administration. His supporters point to the successful fight against HIV/Aids and his efforts to push the government to focus more on tackling rural poverty. Under Zuma, higher education has become a priority, the civil service has expanded dramatically (for better and worse), ministries are more closely monitored, in theory at least, and a long-term National Development Plan has won support from across almost the entire political spectrum. But which is the real Jacob Zuma? Much of hislife storyis one of hardship overcome. He grew up as South Africa’s economy and society were being warped by the racist policies of a white-minority government that sought to separate, suppress and control the black majority. Zuma’s father was a rural policeman who died when his son was five. His mother struggled to earn a living as a domestic worker in Durban, unable to give her son a formal education. As a teenager, Jacob joined the ANC, and then its underground military wing, Umkhonto we Sizwe - formed to fight against the apartheid government both from within South Africa and from bases in neighbouring countries. He was considered a “bright, very keen” recruit - uneducated but with an obvious intelligence and leadership potential. In 1963, he was arrested by the apartheid police and sentenced to 10 years in prison on Robben Island along with Nelson Mandela and other prominent leaders in the liberation struggle. After his release he quickly resumed work in the ANC’s underground intelligence structures, mostly in exile in countries like Swaziland and Mozambique. “A very charming person, very grounded, a man of the people, charismatic. Not as sophisticated as Thabo Mbeki, but very strategic,” remembers Colin Coleman, who met him in exile and now runs Goldman Sachs in South Africa. But others were more wary. Ronnie Kasrils was initially won over by that “very engaging laugh... we got on famously”. But as the two worked closely together for the ANC in Mozambique, he came to see a different side. “Behind the facade of this simple man, he’s highly ambitious... very spiteful and even vindictive,” Kasrils - who would later become minister of intelligence in democratic South Africa - remembers thinking. But the ANC was engaged in a deadly struggle against apartheid. Flaws and mistakes had to be overlooked until the fight was over. Finally, in 1990, Jacob Zuma returned home to take up increasingly powerful positions in a South Africa that was shedding its apartheid past and transforming into the so-called “rainbow nation”. For Kasrils, Zuma’s true nature was now on show. “Power really reveals your character.” In an elegant, wood-panelled courtroom in Bloemfontein, on the high plains of central South Africa, earnest, gowned lawyers are arguing, respectfully, about a case that has mesmerised and frustrated this country for years. It is September 2017, and the matter before the Supreme Court of Appeal is the fate of allegations of corruption, fraud, racketeering, money-laundering and tax evasion. In all there are 18 charges relating to 783 payments. Their origins stretch back to the early 1990s when the newly democratic country was overhauling its military, and a 30bn rand ($5bn; £3bn in 1999) arms deal involving a number of European companies led to allegations of bribery. Zuma has always denied any wrongdoing. The charges have been challenged, dropped, changed, challenged again and reinstated over so many years, by so many different lawyers, judges and prosecutors, that they now carry about them a cobwebbed, Dickensian, aura of legend. The charges that will not die.The “zombie” case. The accused is Jacob Zuma. And the allegations against him have overshadowed his entire presidency. Zuma has never been good with money. Zuma was a good guy, warm guy, but, man, I don’t know what happened to him” In the early 1990s the political exiles rushed home not just to take up leadership positions but also to rebuild their shattered family lives and make up for so many lost years. Jacob Zuma in the 1990s Many were broke, some were profligate, and a few were inclined to believe that, having sacrificed so much for their country’s freedom and its peaceful transition to democracy, they were now entitled to something more. “Zuma was a good guy, warm guy, but, man, I don’t know what happened to him. Pure greed, for himself and his family,” says Bantu Holomisa, a former member of Nelson Mandela’s government but now an opposition MP. In Durban, Zuma quickly found himself targeted by businessmen eager to build contacts with those who seemed destined for high office in the new ANC government. “I don’t believe Jacob Zuma was a bad person, but he became surrounded by these people, and that's where the rot can effectively set in,” says Goldman Sachs’s Colin Coleman. This is a man who now feels the country owes him a livelihood Soon, Zuma was rising fast in the government of his home province, KwaZulu-Natal. He had a state salary, but before long, it is widely alleged, he was running up debts for groceries, cars, school fees and for the home he was building in his village of Nkandla. “Zuma had such a huge appetite. He comes back with numerous children and at least two wives. This is a man who now feels the country owes him a livelihood,” says Kasrils. The scandal appeared to come to a head in 2005, when a court found Durban businessman Schabir Shaikguilty of soliciting bribesfrom a French arms company “for the benefit of Zuma”. Schabir Shaik at his 2005 trial The Supreme Court of Appeal concludedthat “all the accused companies were used at one time or another to pay sums of money to Jacob Zuma in contravention of... the Corruption Act”. Shaik was sentenced to 15 years in prison and South Africa waited as prosecutors built up a seemingly formidable case against Zuma. But the trial never came. Instead, Zuma and his lawyers fought - andcontinue to fight- against the charges. “I don’t think he’s fighting to avoid court, but to ensure that there’s a measure of fairness. The charges... seem quite broad and quite nefarious,” insists Duarte. But to his critics, Zuma’s efforts showed he would stop at nothing. “He’s undermined the justice system. We’ve seen the best people sacked or eliminated from heading these investigative units and replaced by flunkies. In that sense he’s totally hollowed out key elements of the state,” says Kasrils. Zuma has been accused of benefiting from dirty tricks - the timely leak, for instance, ofmysterious wiretap recordingsof senior officials discussing the case led to it being dropped just days before he was due to become president. Once in power, he was criticised repeatedly for appearing to stack the criminal justice system with loyalists, allegedly in order to keep the “Zombie” case at bay. “That’s how Zuma operates. He has manipulated government institutions. Look [at] the National Prosecuting Authority,” says Bantu Holomisa. The National Prosecuting Authority (NPA) has experienced a high - and much criticised - turnover of senior staff. In December 2017, South Africa’s High Court orderedthe NPA boss, Shaun Abrahams, to step downand insisted that the president was too “compromised” to select his successor. Zuma is appealing against that ruling. 2005: Zuma with former South African President Thabo Mbeki Of course, in his day ex-President Thabo Mbeki was accused of using the NPA asa political tool against Zuma. But over the years, it's widely claimed, this case has fuelled Zuma’s taste for conspiracy, and victimhood. He has long blamed his legal troubles on political rivals in the ANC, on opposition parties, and on “former colonial” governments who, he argued in a recent television interview, “look at some leaders in Africa as their enemies, and I’m one of those”. Every new criticism, every allegation of corruption, now appears to reinforce Zuma’s apparent perception of himself as a target of racists and imperialists who are determined to thwart his struggle to free South Africa’s economy from the white businessmen who are still “monopolising every space of the economy”. There is no doubt that South Africa is a profoundly unequal country, and the legacy of apartheid continues to skew the economy in favour of white people, but many people suspect Zuma is now portraying himself as a champion of “radical economic transformation” and enemy of “white monopoly capital” for self-serving reasons. 2016: An anti-rape silent protest directed at Zuma while he delivers a speech in Pretoria It is standing room only inside Johannesburg’s upmarket Hyde Park shopping centre. Middle-class South Africans, black and white, are waiting in polite silence for an evening book talk. No-one can remember anything quite like it - the huge crowd, the sense that an old drama is being brought back to life. In 2006, Jacob Zuma was acquitted of rape. Of all the stories about him, and all the allegations against him, this is the most personal, the most vivid, and the one some South Africans believe exposes their president’s true character in the most damaging way. “This is a typical story of a young woman and a powerful man. And I just didn’t want Jacob Zuma to get away with it,” says the prominent local broadcaster Redi Thlabi. She has written a book about Fezekile “Khwezi” Kuzwayo, who went to court to try to prove that she’d been raped by her dead father’s old friend, a man she considered as an “uncle”. Fezekile “Khwezi” Kuzwayo accused Jacob Zuma of raping her Something close to a collective shudder ripples through the mall as Thlabi begins to explore the notion of consent in a patriarchal culture. A few weeks later the president's deputy and rival Cyril Ramaphosa brings more attention to the issue when he says that hebelieves Zuma’s accuser, prompting Zuma's office to state: ""The court acquitted the president of the rape charges."" During his trial, Zuma was supported by a raucous crowd shouting “burn the bitch” and “100% Zulu boy”. Inside the courthouse, he insisted he and Khwezi had had consensual sex, and that he’d behaved in accordance with his patriarchal Zulu culture when presented with a woman “at that state” - in other words, sexually aroused. South Africa is a violent country, and violence against women remains a national scandal, with more than 40,000 rapes reported to the police each year and a widespread assumption that the true figure is vastly higher. But the story of Zuma’s rape trial has come to underline the divisions between rural and urban communities in a country still wrestling with issues of culture and chauvinism. The judge acquitted him of rape, but condemned his behaviour as “unacceptable”. Zuma had told the court he’dhad a shower after sexto “minimise the risk” of contracting HIV - a comment that would stalk him in mocking cartoon-form for years afterwards. A political demonstrator mocks Zuma's “shower” comments From the start, Zuma chose to see the case as yet another attempt by President Mbeki and his elitist, urban allies to frustrate the ambitions of a country lad - part of a pattern to humiliate him. “Bring me my machine gun!” Zuma sang to his supporters outside court, immediately after the verdict. The words of the old struggle song were an explicit sign that he saw the trial in purely political terms. “The public condemnation of [Khwezi] was so gleeful,” says the writer Sisonke Msimang. “It’s so emblematic of the way women are treated here, and shamed here.” Khwezi was forced into hiding, fleeing abroad after her house was burnt down. She would return, quietly, a few years later onlyto fall ill and die, in 2016. Zuma was, it must be stressed, found not guilty of rape, and Khwezi struck many as anunreliable witness. But in the years since the trial, Zuma’s behaviour towards women has continued to trouble some South Africans. He is a proud polygamist - the practice is legal, but controversial, in South Africa - who has now been married six times, and currently has four wives and more than 20 children. Gertrude Sizakele Khumalo (m. 1973) In 2010 he admitted he’d fathered a child with the daughter of another old family friend, and subsequentlyapologisedto the nation. At the age of 75, Zuma continues to boast of his ability “to win fine-looking women”. Nompumelelo Ntuli (m. 2008) “There’s nothing funny about Zuma being a ‘ladies man’,” says Thlabi. But the well-heeled, liberal crowd at her book launch does not necessarily represent South Africa at large. There is still a huge rural population, with conservative views and a fierce loyalty to the ANC, which remains willing to give Zuma the benefit of the doubt. Thobeka Stacy Mabhija (m. 2010) “The thought of a Zuma presidency was once repugnant to me. He represented everything I was taught not to be,” says the commentator Sipho Seepe, who now argues that middle-class bias is to blame for much of the negative coverage of Zuma. “This is the prejudice of urban blacks. The middle class can never have an honest reading of him. You can’t hold it against people [like Zuma] who are victims of the poverty that was brought in by apartheid,” he says. Gloria Bongekile Ngema (m. 2012) The argument can be extended beyond the rape case, to include the belief, among some, that President Zuma's achievements are being deliberately ignored. “[There’s] quite a big list of achievements,” says Jessie Duarte. And the ANC remains the dominant party in South Africa, treasured by millions, and with a formidable track record of delivering homes and basic services to the poorest in society. And yet the statistics of the Zuma era make for grim reading. The economy is growing at just 1% a year, official unemployment is rising towards the 30% mark, and the credit ratings agencies are nudging the country towards “junk” status. A bloated and highly paid state bureaucracy swallows vastly more government revenue than similar-sized economies, and perhaps most shockingly of all, new education statistics suggest only 22% of 10-year-olds are able to read “for meaning”. On a pale green hillside in rural KwaZulu-Natal, a cluster of conspicuously well-thatched buildings emerges from the surrounding countryside. From a distance, it looks almost like a traditional African village, with round huts and an enclosure for the cattle nestling just below the brow of the hill. But if you approach the area on foot, you’ll quickly spot the high security fences and neatly paved roads, and if you look even closer, you’ll see a swimming pool, shaped like a spear tip, and a large amphitheatre surrounded by a maze of large buildings. It is like wandering into a luxury resort. This is Nkandla, Jacob Zuma’s private homestead, and the scene of an extraordinary scandal. “Nkaaaaaandla!” In 2012, a grinning Zuma told parliament that he and his family had paid for all the lavish upgrades to his home. He elongated Nkandla’s middle vowel to mimic and mock the accents of the white opposition MPs who were among those accusing him of illegally wasting taxpayers’ money on the refurbishments. “I am not guilty,” he insisted. It would take years of rival investigations, court cases, appeals and finally a damning statement from South Africa’s Constitutional Court to establish beyond doubt that many of the “security upgrades” - worth some 246 million rand ($23m; £13.8m in 2014) - that the government had paid for at Nkandla werenothing of the sort. Zuma stood accused of improperly benefiting from a building programme that turned a comfortable array of traditional rural buildings into something that more closely resembled a five-star hotel. It is Zuma’s Versailles. “The president has thusfailed to uphold, defend and respect the constitution,” South Africa’s Constitutional Court concluded, pointedly citing the “cattle kraal, chicken run, swimming pool, visitors’ centre and the amphitheatre”. Zuma’s allies in government and parliament had tried, with increasingly comical contortions, to argue that these were essential security features. Several officials described the swimming pool as a “fire pool”. “In order to eliminate or minimise potential risks and due to water supply which was erratic,a fire poolwas decided on as the most viable option for firefighting,” said Public Works Minister Thulas Nxesi. In protecting Zuma from proper scrutiny, parliament itself - the judges concluded - had “flouted its obligations” and broken the law. Unlike the giant but opaque arms deal, Nkandla was something that every South African could understand. Zuma finallyconcededthat unintentional mistakes had been made, andapologisedfor the “frustration and confusion” that had resulted. He reimbursed the state for some of the money spent. But Zuma didn’t stand down as president. The majority of his party stood by him - through gritted teeth - as blame was shifted towards more junior officials. “[President Zuma has] allowed the resources of the state to be used for the benefit of his family. He should stand down because he’s betrayed a constitutional responsibility that he swore to uphold,” says Sipho Pitanya, the prominent businessman, ANC stalwart and leader of the campaign group Save SA. Zuma faces parliamentary questions about his Nkandla home, September 2016 “It’s the politics of patronage,” fumes Bantu Holomisa. “He rewards the people who would have challenged him by giving them cabinet positions. Many of these people who would have [spoken out] have a bone in their mouth, so they’re unable to bark too much.” In private, Zuma’s closest aides still moan about their boss’s “stubbornness”, and about how a relatively minor issue - that might have been seen as a problem of inflated costs and a weak bureaucracy rather than overt greed - was allowed to turn into a festering, years-long controversy. Nkandla enabled the president’s critics to turn him into a caricature of a corrupt African “big man”. It was the perception of a cover-up, not the crime, that did so much of the damage. He could, right at the beginning, have blamed the security services, apologised immediately for any confusion and paid up what he owed. But some people admired his tenacity or saw him, yet again, as the rural chief being victimised by urban elites. “He fought back on Nkandla because of the manner in which it was intially presented to him. The people who do the upgrades are from the state security apparatus,” says Jessie Duarte. But in a country where many families wait for decades on government housing lists, or struggle in shoddy council homes or the ever-expanding tin shacks of South Africa’s “informal settlements”, Nkandla has become a byword for an increasingly pervasive culture of official entitlement and corruption. Homeless people in a Johannesburg township Nkandla was a prominent opposition slogan in the 2016 elections that saw the governing ANC’s share of the popular vote sink towards 50%, and key cities - Johannesburg, Pretoria, Port Elizabeth - join Cape Town by falling to opposition parties. But if Nkandla seemed like a presidency-defining scandal, an even more serious one was poised to eclipse it. Atul Gupta (left) and his brother Ajay speak in Johannesburg, 2011 In April 2013, a chartered Airbus A330 carrying 200 civilians touched down at the Waterkloof airbase south of Pretoria to an unusually extravagant VIP reception. The plane was carrying guests from India to a lavish wedding at the Sun City resort. The host family’s name was Gupta. Officials rolled out a red carpet and provided a huge police escort. They later told the media that they believed they were acting on instructions from, or anticipating the wishes of, the Guptas’ close friend “Number 1” -better known as Jacob Zuma. The Gupta brothers had arrived in South Africa from India in the early 1990s, looking for business opportunities. They started in computers, prospered spectacularly, and in a canny move, hired two of President Zuma’s children to work for them. The Johannesburg HQ of Sahara Computers, owned by the Gupta family For a while the Guptas, in their vast compound in the old-moneyed Johannesburg suburb of Saxonwold, struck many as sharp-elbowed but relatively unremarkable figures - just one more family trying to muscle its way into the world of lucrative state contracts. The Gupta family compound in the Johannesburg suburb of Saxonwold “Every human being has the right to have friends,” an indignant Zuma told parliament. Then, late in the evening, on Wednesday 9 December 2015, President Zuma appeared on television to make an unexpected announcement. Without explanation, Zuma informed South Africans that the highly respected Finance Minister, Nhlanhla Nene, was being removed. His replacement would be David Van Rooyen. Who? Almost no-one outside the corridors of parliament had ever heard of him. Zuma with his short-lived finance minister, David Van Rooyen Nothing about the announcement appeared to make any sense. And the country reacted accordingly. The South African rand immediately plummeted. Billions of dollars were wiped off the stock exchange. And powerful figures quietly began begging President Zuma to change his mind. The newcomer Van Rooyenlasted just four days. But the bizarre reshuffle remained unexplained until months later. Then Deputy Finance Minister Mcebisi Jonasissued his own explosive statement. He said he had been invited to the Guptas’ Saxonwold compound and offered the top job - finance minister. “I will have to agree to co-operate with the Guptas. They offered 600 million rand, and 600 later,” Jonas later told me. He turned it down. Mcebisi Jonas claims to have been offered money by the Guptas The Guptas were accused of seeking to buy control over one of the most important jobs in the country in a manner that strongly implied they had the president’s blessing. “Essentially what it said is that you have a shadow state,” run by the Guptas and Zuma, said Jonas. The Gupta family strongly denied the allegation and said they had never met Jonas. They later attacked an anti-corruption investigation. ""Our cursory reading of [the report] shows the evidence gathered is riddled with errors and is subject to rebuttal."" Jacob Zuma and his son Duduzane, who was allegedly at the Saxonwold meeting, also denied it. But before long, avast haul of leaked emails appeared- apparently from the Guptas’ business empire - and began adding substantial flesh to the claim that the Guptas now wielded outrageous power within the South African state. Some of those implicated have reportedly said the emailsare genuine, but others have raised doubts. The Guptashave said that the emails are not authenticand they strenuously deny any suggestion of corrupt behaviour.  They have submitted sworn affidavits to the contrary. The emails are ostensibly devastating. They appear to show that other ministers, and key figures at giant public companies like the power utility Eskom, were being groomed and co-opted by the Guptas. There were lavish foreign trips to Dubai and numerous other perks. To many in South Africa, it was obvious that a criminal investigation had to follow. But the NPA has seemed to drag its feet. Its most recent leader, Shaun Abrahams - now ordered to step down by the High Court - was routinely mocked as“Shaun the Sheep”by opposition politicians and commentators who felt his true loyalty was to the president, not justice. The NPA hasvehemently denied that Abrahams is a puppet. “Those perceptions are really unfair. People should at times come with empirical evidence and say this is what the national director has done for us to come to this conclusion,” said NPA spokesman Luvuyo Mfaku. New information on the extent of the Guptas’ alleged influence over Zuma has attracted the attention of investigators in the US and Europe. The FBI and Britain’s Serious Fraud Office arelooking into claims of links to the Guptas’ business empire. Zuma has angrily denied that the state has been “captured”. Instead he blames “foreign culprits” who have paid money to his political rivals “so they can help promote the interests” of Western governments and capital. It’s an explanation that has been enthusiastically endorsed by the Guptas themselves, and by some radical voices in South African politics now championing the drive against “white monopoly capital”. But Zuma’s rival Cyril Ramaphosa spoke openly of “a plan to implement grand-scale corruption, which was all-pervasive”. “This saga left me with a very deep sense of grief and anger,” says Murphy Morobe, an ANC veteran who’d once spent time, like Jacob Zuma, imprisoned on Robben Island. The impact on South Africa has gone far beyond the realm of politics. The allegations have damaged the economy and currency. Ratings agencies now cite political uncertainty as they downgrade the country’s investment prospects ever closer to“junk” status. White plastic chairs are flying back and forth across a crowded hall in Eastern Cape, hurled by rival members of the ANC. In the grainy footage of the incident, filmed on a mobile phone, the chairs almost remind one of birds swooping and fighting over a brightly coloured rubbish tip. Somehow that image feels appropriate for a grand liberation movement that is now tearing itself apart in what, to many, looks like an increasingly sordid, vicious, battle over the spoils of patronage and power. ANC officials have been shot dead - particularly in Zuma’s home province of KwaZulu-Natal - andwhistleblowers have been driven out of the party. “There is a war that is silent,” one ANC MP, Makhosi Khoza, told me earlier this year, soon after declaring she’d received death threats for backing a parliamentary motion to remove President Zuma from office. She has since left the party to form a new one. “South Africa is both a dictatorship and a kleptocracy. Maybe as a liberation movement we have reached a dead end,” she concluded. “I’m heartbroken,” says one of the ANC’s most senior officials, who often defends the president in public, but privately fears that the Zuma era will be remembered as a turning point for the party, and the country - a time when impunity became the norm, loyalty trumped ability, and the public lost faith in its hard-won democracy and attendant state institutions. The optimists believe that South Africa is still strong enough to weather these storms. They think that the struggle to overcome the legacy of racial apartheid was never going to be won in a few short decades, that the judiciary will fight back, and that in its own raucous, belligerent way, the country is slowly shifting from the monolithic ANC era into a more uncertain, confrontational but fundamentally positive era of multi-party democracy. Others fear that time is running out - that a struggling economy, the growing frustration of an impoverished underclass, and an increasingly polarised and racialised political climate will push South Africa towards some sort of dramatic reckoning. Inevitably, given its proximity and its history, the comparison is often made with Zimbabwe, and its spectacular economic collapse. “Ehe... ehehehehehe!” In early October 2017, President Zuma chuckled his way through some rambling, genial remarks to a visiting delegation in a Pretoria conference chamber. Sitting opposite him was Zimbabwe’s 93-year old President Robert Mugabe, still in power, slumped in his seat and smiling at Zuma. When it was his turn to speak, Mugabe drew parallels between his own liberation movement, Zanu-PF, and the ANC. Then, going off script, he worried out loud - and presciently, in terms of his own immediate political future - whether the “future is rendered into nothingness, torn apart”. Standing behind a velvet rope, watching the two elderly men flanked by their cabinets, I was struck by the over-riding sense of weariness emanating from the chamber. These were tired old men, trudging through another choreographed encounter, each approaching the end of his term - although Mugabe could have had no inkling of the dramas that November held in store for him. Both men have been rightly celebrated for remarkable achievements. Both are stubborn, courageous, and in their own ways, profoundly committed to their respective countries. And yet both men’s accomplishments are now overshadowed by their own individual flaws. With Mugabe it was his brittle arrogance, his ruthless determination to hold on to power and, ultimately, his crass and insecure attempt to install his wife as successor. Zuma is a warmer-blooded figure. But his profligacy, his philandering, his vanity, and his hard-learned habit of seeing a conspiracy behind every criticism, have turned him into democratic South Africa’s greatest cautionary tale. In a rare television interview, Zuma tried to flesh out his achievements as president. But as usual, he quickly found himself distracted by talk of plots and intrigue. “It is a reality - I was poisoned. Some people wanted me dead,” he said of a  mysterious incident. Zuma seemed to insinuate that unnamed “former colonial countries” might be behind the poisoning. “They’re trying every method to weaken the ANC,” he claimed. “There’s nothing, nothing factual. It’s just political... political propaganda,” he fumed of the mountain of allegations that have piled up at his door. “It’s easy to criticise.” It is indeed. It is tempting to wonder how Jacob Zuma will spend his retirement. Relaxing, perhaps, with his family at Nkandla. Or, as is beginning to seem more likely as he loses a string of court rulings, continuing the long legal battle to clear his name. Built with Shorthand"
Reality Check: What's phase two?,"The European Council has said that Brexit talks can enter the second phase following last week's agreement. As a result it haspublished its guidelines,externalfor the next stage of talks. Here are some of the key phrases from that document. Don't forget that there are plenty of crucial details that still need to be resolved before negotiations on a withdrawal agreement come to an end. That means the financial settlement, citizens' rights and of course, the Irish border. Sufficient progress is not the end of the story, but the text also makes it clear that there will be a concerted effort to lock in what has been agreed so far - and that if the EU detects any reluctance or backsliding from the UK then that will have a negative effect on discussions about the future. Theresa May has already agreed that a transition of about two years will take place under existing EU rules and regulations, but the EU's text makes crystal clear what it believes that means. The UK will have to accept all EU law (that's what the acquis means) including new laws passed during the transition itself. But it will no longer have a seat at the table when those laws are made. To put it brutally - the UK will, for a while, become a rule-taker rather than a rule-maker. Both sides talk of a strictly time-limited transition period, so there doesn't appear to be much appetite at the moment for extending it. Quite what happens if a future trade deal isn't ready by the end of the transition, a scenario many experts think is quite possible, will have to be debated in the future. During the transition, the UK will have to accept the full jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, and all four freedoms - including the freedom of movement of people. The EU says the UK will remain in the single market and the customs union during a transition, while the UK insists that it will leave both on Brexit day. This could become a semantic argument, because by accepting all rules and regulations - in other words, the status quo - the UK will remain in the single market and the customs union whether it likes it or not. The British government has suggested that some things - like dispute resolution mechanisms - could change during the transition as agreement is made on future co-operation. But there's little appetite in the EU for that - in its view, you're either in or you're out. The EU 27 stress that they want a close partnership with the UK in the future, but here they are setting out the limits of what they could mean. The further away the UK wants to be from the rules and regulations of the single market the less access it will have - there is no such thing as partial membership. This gets us back to the unresolved debate about what ""full alignment"" at the Irish border really means in practice. The phrase ""preserve a level playing field"" is important too. The EU is anxious to ensure that the UK doesn't try to undercut the EU in any way by having looser regulations in certain key areas, and, if it does, then there will be consequences. EU negotiators won't have the authority to start discussions with the UK on future relations (including trade and also things like security and foreign policy) until another set of guidelines is adopted in March 2018. That gives the two sides not much more than six months to agree the text of a broad political declaration on the outlines of the future relationship. The EU hopes to get that finalised by October 2018, but it emphasises that formal trade negotiations can only begin after the UK has left the EU. Informal contacts on what the future might look like are probably taking place already, but the EU is still waiting for greater clarity from London about what exactly the UK government hopes to achieve in the long term. The UK is trying to be as ambitious as possible about what can be done before Brexit actually happens. The EU, though, emphasises that trade talks will have to continue long after the UK has left.

Move to head off Brexit rebellion,"Tory rebels defeated the government on Wednesday The government looks likely to avoid another potential Commons defeat on Brexit, the BBC understands. Tory rebels have been concerned about plans to put the Brexit date and time - 11pm on 29 March 2019 - into law. But backbenchers have tabled an amendment to the EU Withdrawal Bill allowing some flexibility. Ministers are highly likely to accept the amendment in a vote next week, BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg said. It comes as EU leaders agreed to move to the next phase of Brexit talks. Brexit talks to move to next stage - EU Reality Check: Guidelines for Brexit negotiations Brexit: All you need to know Theresa May suffered her first Commons defeat as prime minister on Wednesday, as Tory rebels joined forces with Labour and the SNP to vote for a plan to give MPs a bigger say in any Brexit deal. Ministers feared they might be heading for a further defeat on Wednesday, when MPs vote on a plan to enshrine the Brexit date in law. A number of Conservative MPs had echoed Labour concerns the move could box Britain into a corner if negotiations with the EU go to the wire. Several Conservative MPs, including former Cabinet minister Oliver Letwin, have now tabled an amendment to the bill that would give the government more flexibility over the exit day. The new amendment seeks to allow the government to change the ""exit day"" through further legislation, if the negotiations are continuing. Ministers are likely to accept their plan, which is a change that some of the potential rebels have been asking for, the BBC understands. Senior sources are confident they can see off a defeat, after No 10 said there were no plans to take the date out of the bill. Conservative MP Dominic Grieve, who led Wednesday's rebellion, told BBC Three Counties Radio: ""I am aware that the government has, I think, this afternoon tabled a further amendment for next Wednesday, which very sensibly looks like it will resolve the issue that was troubling some of us. ""If that is the case, and I am fairly confident it is, then that issue will be satisfactorily resolved."" Bernard Jenkin, a leading Tory Brexiteer, said: ""The purpose of this amendment is to avoid needless division over matters of detail when we should be supporting the PM. ""Nothing that has occurred alters the determination of the government to achieved the kind of Brexit that the PM set out in her Lancaster House speech - which takes back control of our borders, our money and our laws and our our ability to do meaningful trade deals.""

Kuenssberg: A hard road ahead,"Phew. After the six months she has had, Theresa May might be entitled to breathe a sigh of relief, as the European Council officially declared that the first phase of our long goodbye from the European Union is over. Stand back from the daily dramas and perhaps it was always bound to happen. Both sides are committed to getting an agreement. The EU and the UK both want a deal to be done, and while there has, inevitably, been grumpiness on both sides, they have, in the main, dealt with each other in good faith. Brexit talks to move to next stage - EU But the fragility of the government, and the complexities of some of the issues, have meant that, on some occasions, it has felt like the prime minister might not get there. Had she not been able to get this far, there genuinely could have been questions about her future. The conventional wisdom is that the next phase will be more complicated, even more fraught. There are some optimists in government who believe it doesn't have to be that way - because the UK and the EU are already partners, it's a question of unpicking an existing relationship, rather than putting one together from scratch. But there are significant contradictions to iron out, contrasting motivations, conflicting views inside the Conservative Party as well as among the EU 27. The experience of the past few months suggests, in fact, that the way ahead will be extremely fraught and the prime minister's goal of a full agreement by March 2019 is hopeful, rather than grounded in reality. But for today, at least, Mrs May's team can be satisfied, if only for a moment or two, that they have managed even to come this far.

Britvic confirms factory closure,"Britvic co-owns the site with Unilever, which owns Colman's Mustard Britvic has confirmed it will leave its Norwich site, with the loss of hundreds of jobs in the city, in 2019. The drinks manufacturer, which co-owns Carrow Works with Unilever, said it would transfer production of Robinsons and Fruit Shoot to its other sites. It said it would offer employees redeployment and ""help to find alternative employment"". The Unite union said the announcement just before Christmas was a bid to ""bury bad news"". Britvic said it currently employed 249 people at the site, which it shares with Colman's Mustard. Manufacturing will instead take place at Rugby, east London and Leeds. ""Transferring production will improve efficiency and productivity and reduce our environmental impact,"" the company said. The decision follows a consultation with employee representatives, including the GMB and Unite unions. Britvic said it would transfer production of Robinsons and Fruit Shoot to other factories Chief executive Simon Litherland said: ""This was not a proposal that we made lightly and we understand that the outcome of the collective consultation process will be upsetting for our colleagues in Norwich. ""It is a sad and difficult time. ""I want to thank everyone at Norwich, past and present, for their dedication, hard work and commitment, and I would like to say again that this decision is in no way a reflection of their performance."" The Unite union criticised the timing of the announcement and described the closure as ""a hammer blow for the workers and the economy of Norwich in the run up Christmas"". Its national officer for the food and drink sector, Julia Long, branded the announcement as ""a classic case of trying to bury bad news"". The move by Britvic has been mooted for several months, with fears expressed for the future of Colman's Mustard, which has been manufactured at the site since 1860. Unilever, which owns Colman's, has previously said it could shut the site if Britvic closed operations.

Hillsborough horse claim pair not charged,"The scene unfolding at the Leppings Lane terrace where Liverpool fans were standing A mounted officer and a police worker who claimed Liverpool fans burned a horse with cigarettes during the Hillsborough disaster will not face criminal charges. The former South Yorkshire Police officer and the civilian farrier were accused of making up the story. Both men were referred to the Crown Prosecution Service (CPS) by the police watchdog. The CPS said the families of the 96 Hillsborough victims had been informed. TheIndependent Police Complaints Commission,external(IPCC) had submitted files on the two men following allegations about falsified evidence. Prosecutors said the mounted officer had been seen on camera before the FA Cup semi-final lashing out towards fans, whom he later claimed were burning his horse with cigarettes. The farrier, who was a friend of the officer, also described the injuries sustained by the horse. It was alleged that the accounts were false and given to protect the officer from disciplinary action. The CPS said the evidential threshold for a charge of perverting the course of justice had been met in relation to the farrier, but it was concluded that it was not in the public interest to charge him. It said the evidential threshold had not been met in relation to the officer. IPCC deputy chairwoman Rachel Cerfontyne said: ""It was vitally important that allegations of such a serious nature were investigated robustly."" Six men, including match commander David Duckenfield, are already facing prosecution for alleged offences related to the disaster on 15 April 1989 and its aftermath. Once all criminal proceedings have concluded, the IPCC will consider whether any former officers would have had cases to answer for misconduct. Evidence supporting these findings will be set out in a final investigation report. A total of 96 Liverpool fans were fatally crushed during the stadium disaster on 15 April as their FA Cup semi-final began against Nottingham Forest.

Unilever sells margarine business to KKR,"Unilever has agreed to sell its margarine and spreads business, which include Flora and ProActiv, to private equity giant KKR for â¬6.8bn ($8bn; Â£6bn). The move follows a wide-ranging review of its business which was prompted by a takeover attempt by rival Kraft. Unilever said it would look for a buyer of the spreads business in April. At the time, it said the firm would step up its cost-cutting, aiming for a 20% margin by 2020. It said the margarine business was a ""declining segment"" that could be ""better managed by others"". As well as Flora and ProActiv, it also owns I Can't Believe It's Not Butter and Bertolli. Paul Polman, chief executive of Unilever, said: ""The announcement today marks a further step in reshaping and sharpening our portfolio for long term growth. ""I am confident that under KKR's ownership, the spreads business, with its iconic brands, will be able to fulfil its full potential as well as societal responsibilities."" Unilever's other household names include Persil, Domestos and Hellman's mayonnaise. It operates across more than 190 countries.

Million Britons lack 'decent' broadband,"Decent broadband can be hard to find in some rural areas, said Ofcom The UK's digital divide has narrowed but more than one million homes and offices still struggle to get good broadband, says an Ofcom report. The Connected Nations report,externalfound that about 4% of properties cannot get a broadband speed fast enough to meet their needs. Last year, about 1.6 million UK properties were in this position. Smartphone access to the net also needed to improve, it said, as many only got weak signals when travelling. ""Broadband coverage is improving, but our findings show there's still urgent work required before people and businesses get the services they need,"" said Steve Unger, Ofcom's technology chief, in a statement. ""Everyone should have good access to the internet, wherever they live and work,"" he added. The UK's appetite for data has grown at a huge rate in the last 12 months, found the report. The average amount of data carried across UK networks grew by 52% during that period. The average home broadband connection now carries about 190 gigabytes of data every month, it found. Telecommunications watchdog Ofcom defines decent broadband as a speed of about 10 megabits per second (Mbps) to download and one mbps to upload. At these speeds, downloading a high-definition movie could take up to 90 minutes, said Ofcom, if no one else was using that link to the net. Ofcom said the 1Mbps upload speed was becoming more critical as small businesses and families make greater use of video-sharing and conferencing, which require good upload speeds. Ofcom said the problem of poor broadband was most pronounced in rural areas, where about 17% lack decent broadband. The 10 down/one up split is the specification for Ofcom's proposed universal service offering - which every property in the UK should be able to receive, it said. Many places cannot obtain these speeds because they are in rural areas that are far from telephone exchanges or street cabinets through which broadband is delivered. More broadly, said the report, access to superfast broadband services that run in excess of 30Mbps was improving. By May 2017, 91% of properties could receive such a service - a small increase from last year when the figure stood at 89%. The higher speeds were proving popular, suggested the report, with 38% of premises that can get it signing up for the service. Mobile signals are often weak on road and rail routes As well as fixed-line broadband, the Ofcom report also said mobile operators needed to work harder to give customers a better experience. Now, about 58% of premises can get a 4G signal indoors - up from 40% in 2016. However, it said, many people struggled to receive good coverage when they were out and about. Currently only 43% of the UK's landmass can get signals from all four mobile operators. Coverage was often poor on roads and railways, said Ofcom. It said it was engaged in work to measure mobile connectivity on travel routes to monitor if operators are improving services for customers. ""People have never relied so much on their phones in daily life,"" said Mr Unger, adding that Ofcom's work would help to give people a more accurate picture of the quality of the service they can expect. Matt Hancock, minister for digital, said there was a ""clear need"" for rapid improvements to mobile coverage. ""We've recently removed outdated restrictions, giving mobile operators more freedom to improve their networks including hard-to-reach rural areas,"" he said. ""But industry need to play their part too through continued investment and improvement in their networks, making sure that customers are not paying for services they don't receive.""

Sky and BT sign channel sharing deal,"The rising cost of sports rights is behind the agreement, analysts say Sky and BT have have signed a deal to sell their channels on each other's platforms. Under the deal, BT will now supply its sports channels - which show UEFA Champions League and Premier League football - to Sky. In addition, BT will be able to sell Sky's Now TV service - which includes Sky Sports, Sky Cinema and the Sky Atlantic channel - to its customers. The deal comes as the firms face growing competition from online rivals. Marc Allera, the chief executive of BT Consumer, told the BBC that the deal was partly so the firms could join forces against the potential online threat. ""A lot of technology companies are coming into the market with vast budgets, and changing the market. We need to ensure our customers get the best choice,"" he said. In a complex market, potential rivals can also be partners, he added. Walt Disney buys Murdoch's Fox for $52bn Five reasons why the Murdochs are selling Fox to Disney Amazon to broadcast ATP Tour from 2019 He said the Sky deal was a ""clear indication"" of the importance BT attached to how digital and TV markets were converging, adding the firm would bid fiercely for exclusive content. Bidding is due to begin in the next Premier League football rights auction in February, and digital giants such as Amazon and Facebook could throw their hats in the ring for streaming rights. However, Mr Allera said: ""I wouldn't say [the deal with Sky] takes the pressure off at all... we believe in holding exclusive rights."" BT has spent more than Â£3.5bn on Champions League and Premier League football rights since 2012 in an attempt to compete with Sky. For the 2016 to 2019 football seasons, BT agreed to pay Â£960m to show 42 Premier League games, and Sky agreed to pay Â£4.17bn to show 126 games. For the seasons from 2019 to 2021, the number of games shown could rise to 190. BT has exclusive TV rights for Champions League games until 2021 Sky boss Jeremy Darroch said,external: ""This is great news for Sky customers who will be able to access all matches on Sky and BT channels from the Premier League, UEFA Champions League and Europa League directly with a single Sky TV subscription."" The new services will be available to BT and Sky customers from early 2019. At present, BT customers can get BT TV via a box, an app, or online, and can only get a pared down version of Sky Sports. Sky customers can get BT Sport at present, but only if they subscribe through BT. Richard Broughton, research director at media analysts Ampere, called the deal ""very unusual"" because of the rivalry between the two firms, but said it was a consequence of the rising costs of sports rights. ""The new rights are up for renewal very soon and this is a pre-emptive shot from both companies to limit their exposure to damage should they not get key rights and also allow them to be a little less aggressive in their bidding."" Michael Hewson, an analyst with CMC Markets, said the BT-Sky deal seemed better for BT than Sky, ""given that Sky will take BT's sport content while BT gets Sky's sports, cinema and Sky Atlantic channel, and could even gain more access to content further down the road"". The big online firms have been part of a seismic shift in how people access content. On Thursday, Disney announced a deal to buy a large chunk of 21st Century Fox, including its 39% stake in Sky. Media mogul Rupert Murdochtold Sky News,externalhe was selling Fox's entertainment assets in part due to the rise of online giants. ""[Amazon and Netflix] are growth companies... Amazon, I don't know how much they want to do. They are spending $5bn or $6bn I believe on new programmes, but it's basically to widen the appeal of [Amazon] Prime. ""Anyone who joins Prime seems to spend about $3,000 immediately on retail... you know, they are a huge disruptor if you look at what they're doing."" He said the new Fox company that remained would have the strength to bid for sports rights, but that all companies could be ""threatened by big nonsensical bids from the likes of Facebook"".

Thousands lose water after pipe burst,"Bottled water is being distributed from a supermarket car park in Tewkesbury Some 10,000 homes and businesses have been left without water due to a burst main. Thirteen schools have also been closed in Tewkesbury, north Gloucestershire,,externalas engineers work to repair the burst. Severn Trent Water used a helicopter and drones to locate the problem. It apologised and confirmed ""water is gradually returning to normal for customers in Tewkesbury"" and added it ""aims to have everyone restored tonight as quickly as possible"". Tens of thousands of litres of bottled water are currently being distributed across three water handout sites. The firm said it was using tankers to inject water directly into pipes to help customers. A spokesperson said: ""As it's a wide area that's been affected, it's a complicated job to get the system back to normal and it will take a while for the pipes to refill, so please bear with us.

Condom use 'low among under-25s',"A new campaign's being launched by Public Health England to get more under-25s to use condoms to prevent sexually transmitted infections spreading. It's the first government sexual health campaign in eight years. It comes as a survey carried out by PHE and YouGov revealed that almost half of sexually active young people have had sex with someone new for the first time without using a condom. One in 10 had never even used one. STIs can cause infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease, swollen or painful testicles and even meningitis. Public Health England and YouGov spoke to more than than 2,000 16-24-year-olds about their sexual health. The main reason for not using a condom was because they said sex felt better without one. Jordan, who's 19 and from Wrexham, admits he only uses them around ""half the time"". He told Newsbeat that being drunk was one of the reasons he hadn't used one with a new partner. ""Drink definitely has an effect, because when you're drunk, you're more careless."" The poll found half the people who admitted to not using a condom had done so when drunk. We also spoke to Lydia who admits she's more cautious when sober. Lydia says when she's drunk she's less likely to practise safe sex But she adds the feeling is ""not as nice"" when a partner uses a condom. Both admit to feeling guilty the day after having unprotected sex and have visited an STI clinic to get tested. Other reasons given in the survey for not using a condom during sex included one of a couple being on the pill or having a contraceptive implant. That's something student Ellie says is common. The 20-year-old admits some men she's slept with are far more worried about getting her pregnant than getting an STI. Ellie says men she's slept with are far more concerned about pregnancy than STIs ""It's on them then, isn't it? If it's a baby, it's them too. ""If it's an STI, it's your responsibility."" Jordan adds: ""If a girl's on the pill, then it's another way of saying 'you don't need to use a condom then'."" In 2016, there were more than 141,000 chlamydia and gonorrhoea diagnoses in people aged between 15 and 24 in England. Jesse, who's 24, told Newsbeat he contracted both because he didn't use a condom. Jesse admits he used to sleep around and didn't use protection ""It wasn't a nice experience. They caused pain in my groin and discomfort when urinating. ""The worst of it though was having to tell my previous and current sexual partner that I had contracted the STIs, so they also needed to get checked and treated. Symptoms vary but some, like chlamydia, may not even show any. ""I had symptoms, but I know there are so many people who don't have symptoms,"" says Jesse. ""Now when having sex with someone new I will definitely use a condom."" Doctors are worried because gonorrhoea is becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics, andmay become untreatable in the future. GP Dr Sara Kayat says the only way to avoid getting an STI is to use a condom. Dr Sara Kayat is supporting Public Health England's campaign ""Whilst many STIs are symptomless, contracting them can have serious health consequences if left untreated and even lead to infertility. ""As I tell patients in my clinic every week, it's just not worth putting yourself at risk by not using a condom.""

Reality Check: Phase two guidelines,"The European Council has said that Brexit talks can enter the second phase following last week's agreement. As a result it haspublished its guidelines,externalfor the next stage of talks. Here are some of the key phrases from that document. Don't forget that there are plenty of crucial details that still need to be resolved before negotiations on a withdrawal agreement come to an end. That means the financial settlement, citizens' rights and of course, the Irish border. Sufficient progress is not the end of the story, but the text also makes it clear that there will be a concerted effort to lock in what has been agreed so far - and that if the EU detects any reluctance or backsliding from the UK then that will have a negative effect on discussions about the future. Theresa May has already agreed that a transition of about two years will take place under existing EU rules and regulations, but the EU's text makes crystal clear what it believes that means. The UK will have to accept all EU law (that's what the acquis means) including new laws passed during the transition itself. But it will no longer have a seat at the table when those laws are made. To put it brutally - the UK will, for a while, become a rule-taker rather than a rule-maker. Both sides talk of a strictly time-limited transition period, so there doesn't appear to be much appetite at the moment for extending it. Quite what happens if a future trade deal isn't ready by the end of the transition, a scenario many experts think is quite possible, will have to be debated in the future. During the transition, the UK will have to accept the full jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice, and all four freedoms - including the freedom of movement of people. The EU says the UK will remain in the single market and the customs union during a transition, while the UK insists that it will leave both on Brexit day. This could become a semantic argument, because by accepting all rules and regulations - in other words, the status quo - the UK will remain in the single market and the customs union whether it likes it or not. The British government has suggested that some things - like dispute resolution mechanisms - could change during the transition as agreement is made on future co-operation. But there's little appetite in the EU for that - in its view, you're either in or you're out. The EU 27 stress that they want a close partnership with the UK in the future, but here they are setting out the limits of what they could mean. The further away the UK wants to be from the rules and regulations of the single market the less access it will have - there is no such thing as partial membership. This gets us back to the unresolved debate about what ""full alignment"" at the Irish border really means in practice. The phrase ""preserve a level playing field"" is important too. The EU is anxious to ensure that the UK doesn't try to undercut the EU in any way by having looser regulations in certain key areas, and, if it does, then there will be consequences. EU negotiators won't have the authority to start discussions with the UK on future relations (including trade and also things like security and foreign policy) until another set of guidelines is adopted in March 2018. That gives the two sides not much more than six months to agree the text of a broad political declaration on the outlines of the future relationship. The EU hopes to get that finalised by October 2018, but it emphasises that formal trade negotiations can only begin after the UK has left the EU. Informal contacts on what the future might look like are probably taking place already, but the EU is still waiting for greater clarity from London about what exactly the UK government hopes to achieve in the long term. The UK is trying to be as ambitious as possible about what can be done before Brexit actually happens. The EU, though, emphasises that trade talks will have to continue long after the UK has left.

Ryanair in union offer to avoid strikes,"Ryanair has said it is prepared to recognise pilot unions as it seeks to avoid strike disruption over the Christmas period. Earlier this week, 79 Dublin-based Ryanair pilots said they would strike for one day on 20 December. The airline was also facing action by pilots elsewhere in Europe. Ryanair has never recognised unions, but it said it would change this policy in order to avoid disruption to flights and passengers in Christmas week. It has written to pilot unions in Ireland, the UK, Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal inviting them for talks. On Friday afternoon,Irish union Impact, which represents pilots,,externalsaid it had ""made contact with"" Ryanair management after receiving a letter from the airline. ""Impact has indicated its belief that an immediate meeting, between management and the union, is now necessary to clarify issues and make progress."" The union said its officials were available ""today or at any time over the coming weekend"". However, they have not called off next week's strike action in Ireland. The UK pilots' union Balpa, which was not planning to strike next week, said it had written to Ryanair to accept the offer of talks. This video can not be played Ryanair tells Today the airline is moving to recognise unions as it's ""time for change"" The carrier said it would recognise unions ""as the representative body for pilots in Ryanair in each of these countries, as long as they establish committees of Ryanair pilots to deal with Ryanair issues, as Ryanair will not engage with pilots who fly for competitor airlines in Ireland or elsewhere"". Ryanair chief operations officer Peter Bellew told the BBC there were ""no strings"" attached to the offer. ""The basis of what we've asked to do is the same as other airlines do around the world and within Europe, so I don't believe there's any strings there."" Ryanair called on the unions to cancel the planned strike on 20 December. However, Mr Bellew said the offer to hold talks about collective bargaining was not just about next week's planned strikes. ""This is about the long term. We have 4,500 pilots working for Ryanair at the moment, great aviation professionals, we need to get a basis with them to work going forward. ""We feel it's the best grounds to move forward with our workforce for the next 10/20 years where we intend to grow to be the biggest airline in the world."" Ryanair's share price fell 8.6% after the invitation to talks became public, amid investors' fears that any change could push up costs. Mr Bellew said: ""I think there might be some minor changes but I don't think it's going to be material in the overall cost of the company."" Pilots in Italy had been due to strike on Friday for four hours, between 13:00 and 17:00 CET (12:00-16:00 GMT). However, following receipt of the letter from Ryanair, the main pilots' union, Anpac, said it had suspended its walkout. Chief executive Michael O'Leary admitted union recognition would be a ""significant change"" for the airline. ""Christmas flights are very important to our customers and we wish to remove any worry or concern that they may be disrupted by pilot industrial action next week,"" he said. ""If the best way to achieve this is to talk to our pilots through a recognised union process, then we are prepared to do so."" In October, Mr O'Leary wrote to the Ryanair's pilots to offer them better pay and conditions after the airline was forced to cancel thousands of flights. At the time of the cancellations the airline admitted it had ""messed up"" the planning of its pilots' holidays. In his letter, Mr O'Leary also apologised for changes that caused disruptions to their rotas and urged them not to leave the airline. Aviation expert John Strickland of JLS Consulting said the idea of Ryanair recognising unions was ""revolutionary"" for the company. ""I think the company realises they need to pay more, they recognise it's a labour group who they cannot do without, they cannot simply replace pilots off the street on a short-term basis. ""There's a global pilot shortage and Ryanair is actually pretty well placed in the pecking order for pilot jobs but they have to make sure these people are on side and not inflame personal feelings with that part of the workforce,"" he added.

Russia a 'new risk' to undersea cables,"This video can not be played Sir Stuart Peach: Russia poses a ""new risk"" to economy and ways of living The UK's most senior military officer has warned of a new threat posed by Russia to communications and internet cables that run under the sea. Air Chief Marshal Sir Stuart Peach, the chief of the defence staff, said Britain and Nato needed to prioritise protecting the lines of communication. He said it would ""immediately and potentially catastrophically"" hit the economy if they were cut or disrupted. The cables criss-cross the seabed, connecting up countries and continents. Could Russian submarines cut off the internet? How much of a threat does Russia pose? Four facts about undersea cables The world's submarine network comprises an estimated 213 independent cable systems and 545,018 miles (877,121 km) of fibre, according to a recent report for thePolicy Exchange think tank,external. But it said a lack of formal state ownership meant cables do not have strong protection in international law. Despite that, an estimated 97% of global communications and $10 trillion in daily financial transactions are transmitted by cables under the ocean. Speaking to the Royal United Services Institute defence think tank, Sir Stuart said the vulnerability of undersea lines posed a ""new risk to our way of life"". He said Nato had prioritised the protection of the cables ""in response to the threat posed by the modernisation of the Russian navy, both nuclear and conventional submarines and ships"". He said it was ""very, very important"" to understand how crucial that mission was for Nato, ""because Russia in addition to new ships and submarines continues to perfect both unconventional capabilities and information warfare."" The UK and its allies needed to ""match and understand Russian fleet modernisation"", he added. An RAF Typhoon escorting Russian warships away from UK waters By Jonathan Beale, BBC defence correspondent Fears of Russia cutting, disrupting or ""wire tapping"" undersea communication lines are growing. Defence and intelligence chiefs see not just increased Russian submarine activity, but its willingness to use unconventional asymmetric warfare. In highlighting this threat, Air Chief Marshall Peach was admitting Britain and its Nato allies were ill-prepared to deal with the prospect of such an attack. There's been a significant increase in Russian submarine activity in the North Atlantic, particularly the GIUK (Greenland, Iceland and the UK) gap. Britain certainly doesn't have enough ships, submarines and aircraft to mount a constant watch. The UK will be getting new maritime patrol aircraft in the next decade, but for now has had to rely on the help of other Nato aircraft to hunt down submarines. Nato's former top military Chief Admiral Stavridis recently said: ""We've allowed this vital infrastructure to grow increasingly vulnerable and this should worry us all."" Sir Stuart said: ""There is a new risk to our way of life, which is the vulnerability of the cables that criss-cross the seabeds. ""Can you imagine a scenario where those cables are cut or disrupted, which would immediately and potentially catastrophically affect both our economy and other ways of living."" According to the Policy Exchange report - published earlier this month - many cable systems are potentially at risk. ""Undersea cables are the indispensable infrastructure of our time, essential to our modern life and digital economy, yet they are inadequately protected and highly vulnerable to attack at sea and on land, from both hostile states and terrorists,"" the report concluded. Conservative MP Rishi Sunak, author of the report, warned a successful attack on the UK's network of undersea communications cables could deal a ""crippling blow"" to the country's security and economy. He said the locations of the cables were ""both isolated and publicly available"" and a successful attack would be an ""existential threat to our security"". There are more than 545,018 miles of fibre cables under the sea - enough to wrap around the Earth almost 22 times Writing a foreword to the document, Admiral James Stavridis, a former US Navy officer and ex-Nato supreme allied commander, said: ""It is not satellites in the sky, but pipes on the ocean floor that form the backbone of the world's economy."" He also warned of a potential threat from China and Iran, as well as Russia. He called for the creation of more ""dark cables"", to be kept in reserve, and said Nato must be prepared to defend global submarine cables, if necessary. It comes aftera ship dragging its anchor cut three undersea internet cablesconnecting the Channel Islands to the UK last year. It resulted in slower internet connections and phone problems across the islands. The laying of the first transatlantic cable was depicted in an 1877 wood engraving The internet has been the driving innovation of 21st Century life but the world started to become ""connected"" more than 160 years ago. The race to lay an undersea or ""submarine"" cable began soon after the first telegraph signal was sent in the 1830s. By 1850 Britain and France were linked. Archaeologist Cassie Newland, who last year curated an exhibition at London's Guildhall Art Gallery on the laying of a transatlantic cable in 1856, hasdescribed the efforts,externalas the ""talk of the age, the Victorian equivalent of the Apollo mission"". The London-based Atlantic Telegraph Company had backing from the British and US governments and two Navy vessels started to lay a copper cable insulated in the natural plastic gutta-percha on a 2,300 miles route between the west coast of Ireland and Newfoundland. It was not until August 1858 that they were successful, an achievement marked by Queen Victoria sending the first transatlantic message to US President James Buchanan. By 1870, there was a cable between Britain and India, and Australia followed two years later. The whole world was connected in 1902 with the laying of cables spanning the 6,000 miles between Manila and San Francisco. Investment in undersea cables did not, of course, stop and the fibre-optic lines of today carry more than 97% of all communication traffic.

Church apology over bishop abuse inquiryFormer Bishop of Chichester George Bell was accused of sexual abuse decades after his death in 1958.1han hour agoSussex,"George Bell was Bishop of Chichester from 1929 until his death in 1958 The Church of England has apologised to the relatives of a bishop for the way it investigated child abuse claims made against him decades after his death. Former Bishop of Chichester George Bell, who died in 1958, was alleged to have repeatedly abused a young girl. She made a formal complaint in 1995 and, 10 years later, won an apology and compensation from the Church. Areport,externalinto the handling of the case has criticised the Church's actions, describing its process as ""deficient"". The current Bishop of Chichester the Right Reverend Martin Warner praised the ""dignity and integrity"" of Bishop Bell's accuser, but said the Church inquiry paid ""inadequate attention to the rights of those who are dead"". In his review, Lord Carlile said the Church ""failed to follow a process that was fair and equitable to both sides"". The allegations against George Bell were first made by the victim, known as ""Carol"", in 1995, but were not investigated or referred to the police. She said the bishop began abusing her when she was five andmolested her in Chichester Cathedralas she sat listening to stories. Carol said the abuse continued for about four years. In 2013, she wrote to the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, at which point the matter was referred to police. Two years later the Church paid Â£16,800 in an out of court settlement and apologised to Carol. However, the ""George Bell Group"" of supporters of the former bishop sought and gained a review into how the Church arrived at that decision. 'Rights of the bishop' Lord Carlile criticised the Church response as ""deficient"" in a number of respects and said the most significant was that ""it failed to follow a process that was fair and equitable to both sides"". He said the Church should be ready to acknowledge sexual abuse committed by the clergy - but that did not mean the reputations of the dead were without value. The independent reviewer said even when alleged perpetrators had died there should be methodical and sufficient investigations. He said in this case it was ""clear that the Crown Prosecution Service evidential charging standard... would not have been met"". Making 15 recommendations, Lord Carlile concluded the Church, feeling it should be supportive of the complainant and transparent in its dealings, failed to engage in a process that gave proper consideration to the rights of the bishop. The review recommended alleged perpetrators, living or dead, should not be identified unless adverse findings of fact are found, or it is in the public interest. It said: ""Whereas in this case the settlement is without admission of liability, the settlement generally should be with a confidentiality provision."" But the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said: ""The decision to publish his name was taken with immense reluctance, and all involved recognised the deep tragedy involved. However, we have to differ from Lord Carlile's point. ""The Church of England is committed to transparency and therefore we would take a different approach."" Bishop Warner said: ""We welcome Lord Carlile's assessment of our processes, and apologise for failures in the work of the Core Group of national and diocesan officers and its inadequate attention to the rights of those who are dead. ""The emotive principle of innocent until proven guilty is a standard by which our actions are judged and we have to ensure as best we can that justice is seen to be done. ""Irrespective of whether she is technically a complainant, survivor, or victim, 'Carol' emerges from this report as a person of dignity and integrity. ""It is essential that her right to privacy continues to be fully respected."" The Church also repeated its apology for failing to report Carol's allegations to the police when she first came forward in 1995.

BBC appoints next head of news,"Fran Unsworth has been appointed the new BBC director of news and current affairs, replacing James Harding, who is leaving at the beginning of 2018. Unsworth is currently director of the BBC World Service Group and deputy director of news and current affairs. She started her BBC career in local radio, before moving to Newsbeat. She went on to become head of political programmes and then newsgathering. After four years at the BBC,Harding is setting up his own news media venture. Amol Rajan: Fran Unsworth's hellish new job BBC director general Tony Hall described the role as ""one of the most demanding of any in broadcasting"", saying he was ""delighted she is taking up the role"". ""She brings a combination of excellent news judgement, authority, management knowhow, and the trust of her colleagues both in news and across the BBC,"" he added. The job of director for news and current affairs, which has been accepted by Fran Unsworth, is undoubtedly one of the biggest in British, some would say international, journalism. It is also, by all accounts, an invitation to hell. Despite being one of the most powerful jobs in journalism, the job is not wholly, or even mainly, editorial. If you are in charge of a particular programme, or publication, the idea is that as editor you get to focus on the exciting business of editorial judgement: what stories, pictures, campaigns, headlines to use and so on. Unfortunately, the sorry financial state of much modern media means that editors' time is increasingly spent doing less fun things, like begging advertisers for money, or sacking people. At the BBC, however, there is a whole other world of pain, and rightly too: as an organisation owned by the public, every penny has to be accounted for, and most of the decision making too. Read the blog in full. James Harding came to the BBC from The Times newspaper Unsworth said she was ""delighted"", adding: ""We are living through a period of significant change at home and abroad. In a complex world, the BBC's journalism matters more than ever. ""I am proud to lead a team of such dedicated and talented people."" Unsworth, who will sit on theBBC's executive committee, will take up the role at the start of the new year. In the past year she has overseen thebiggest expansionof theWorld Servicesince the 1940s, adding 12 new global language services includingKoreanandPidgin.

Smith frustrates England on second day,"This video can not be played Pint-sized Ashes: Australia strike back on day two Third Ashes Test, Waca (day two of five) England 403 (115.1 overs):Malan 140, Bairstow 119, Starc 4-91 Australia 203-3 (62 overs):Smith 92*, Khawaja 50, Overton 2-46 Scorecard Captain Steve Smith made an unbeaten 92 as Australia forced their way back into the third Ashes Test on day two in Perth. Smith's chanceless and controlled knock took the home side to 203-3, 200 behind England. Jonny Bairstow earlier completed a century for the tourists, but after Dawid Malan fell for 140, they lost their last six wickets for 35 runs in 51 balls to be 403 all out. Though Craig Overton removed both openers to leave Australia 55-2, Smith shared 124 with Usman Khawaja, who was dropped twice in his 50. Khawaja was eventually trapped lbw by Chris Woakes, but Smith remained, making batting look quite effortless in perfect conditions. England's lead is healthy and Australia will have to bat last on a surface showing occasional signs of variable bounce - yet Smith's continuing presence leaves the hosts with a chance of gaining first-innings parity at least. With Australia 2-0 up, England must not be beaten at the Waca - a ground where they have not won since 1978 - in order to avoid surrendering the Ashes at the earliest opportunity. Their efforts in the last hour were hampered by an injury to Overton, who took a blow to the ribs in trying to take a return catch off Khawaja. Reaction and analysis to second day's play Headbutt celebration was light-hearted fun - Bairstow Smith had seen David Warner caught behind and Cameron Bancroft pinned leg before, both by the increasingly impressive Overton, when he made his way to the crease with Australia 348 runs behind. The captain's unbeaten 141 was the difference between the sides in the hosts' first Test win in Brisbane and though he was kept relatively quiet at the Adelaide Oval, this was Smith again looking every inch the number one Test batsman in the world. At the Gabba he favoured the leg side; here he played handsome drives through the off side to go with one pull for six off Overton. Khawaja, scoring square of the wicket, played the supporting role until he was undone by one from Woakes that skidded and nipped off the seam. There seemed every chance that Smith would complete a century before the close, but England stopped him from reaching three figures and it is his wicket that they will prize over all others when play gets back under way at 02:30 GMT on Saturday. He will be joined by Shaun Marsh, who took 18 balls to get off the mark, but is coming off the back of a century of his own in Adelaide. England celebrate a successful review to remove Cameron Bancroft As well as Malan batted, the moment that he danced at off-spinner Nathan Lyon, miscued to point and was well held by diving substitute fielder Peter Handscomb can be pinpointed as when Australia began to get back in the game. From there, the England lower order meekly surrendered - as they have in three of the four previous innings in this series. Moeen Ali limply poked Pat Cummins to second slip, Woakes helped Josh Hazlewood to long leg and Bairstow played across the line to be bowled by Starc. Overton patted Hazlewood to short leg and a swiping Stuart Broad top-edged Starc, who ended with 4-91. The final six wickets fell in a little over 45 minutes. With the ball, England needed Overton to show them the correct length, while James Anderson curiously did not deliver a single ball to Smith until the skipper had reached 47. Moeen has not taken a wicket with his off-breaks since the third day of the first Test. More costly were the lives given to Khawaja - first by a diving Overton attempting a return catch when the left-hander had not scored, then by second slip Joe Root, who appeared not to see an edge off Woakes when he was on 28. And, late on, Marsh could have been held off Moeen by either wicketkeeper Bairstow or short leg Mark Stoneman, when the ball flew off the latter's boot but could not be gathered as both dived for it. Feature: Meet Dawid Malan - England's Ashes batting star This video can not be played Bairstow explains his Ashes hundred celebration The early progress of Malan and Bairstow was as serene as the first evening, when Malan reached his maiden Test century. From 305-4 overnight, it took them 27 balls to score the first run of the day, after which Malan was once again into his trademark cover-driving. As he did on Thursday, Bairstow ignored short deliveries and instead waited for anything overpitched to score on both sides of the wicket. When he reached three figures with a single off Mitchell Marsh, the wicketkeeper celebrated his fourth Test century with a 'headbutt' of his helmet, referencing the accusation that he did the same to Bancroft at the beginning of the tour. The Malan-Bairstow partnership of 237 is an England record for the fifth wicket against Australia and, when they were together, the tourists had the chance to bat themselves into an unbeatable position. Malan was furious with himself when he gave his wicket to Lyon - rightly so, considering how Australia then turned the tide. England's Jonny Bairstow, speaking to Test Match Special:""We've got 400 on the board. From 100-4, we could have been out for a lot less than that. ""For us to get 400 from that position was a great effort from the guys. ""We're happy so far. Tomorrow the first couple of sessions are massive for us. There's no reason why we can't come out and take a couple of wickets. ""If we can take a lead into that second innings, who knows what can happen down the line?"" Jonny Bairstow has also scored Test centuries against South Africa and Sri Lanka Former England captain Michael Vaughan:""That was Jonny Bairstow's best Test innings. He ducked and swayed away from the short stuff and had so much balance on the front foot. It was as good as I have seen him. ""England bowled too short again - especially Chris Woakes. He's struggling on this tour. ""England have to take every chance they get tomorrow. Concentration is key.""

Boy who slept on bus tried to walk home,"Schoolboy John Robertson relaxing at home following his ordeal last week A four-year-old boy tried to walk home from a bus depot after being left on his school bus. John Robertson was travelling home to North Kessock from Munlochy Primary School on the Black Isle last Friday. But he did not get off at his stop and ended up, unnoticed, in the bus in D&E Coaches' Inverness Longman depot, about three miles and across the A9's Kessock Bridge from where he lives. The boy was spotted close to Inverness Caledonian Thistle's stadium. He told his parents he had waited onboard the mini bus after it stopped at the depot, expecting the driver to come and find him. After a time, still on his own inside the bus unnoticed, he managed to open the door and set out to find his way home. D&E Coaches said it was ""extremely disappointed"" by the circumstances of the incident. It has dismissed the driver for gross misconduct. Highland Council, which contracts D&E Coaches as a provider of its school transport, and Police Scotland have begun investigations into the incident. John's parents, Nikki and John, had thought he was late home because the school bus had been delayed by bad weather, which included snow showers. His father was waiting for John at home where the boy should have been dropped off. John Robertson snr had expected his son to be dropped off at home John tried to make his way home after being left on a bus in a coach depot It was the boy's fifth time taking the school bus, which takes about eight children to and from Munlochy Primary. John's parents usually take him to and from school by car, but the car had broken down. On the previous four days, John was dropped off near the door of his home.  But the bus did not appear near the flats that Friday. John's father initially believed this may have been because of the snow and that John had been dropped off a short distance away. When John still had not come home, his family called the bus company and were told that John had been dropped off. In a follow up call they were told that he had not got on the bus. John's parents began calling friends, family and police in an effort to find him. Family and friends also made searches of North Kessock and Munlochy for the youngster. Mr Robertson toldBBC Radio Scotland's John Beattie programmehe was half way through a call to police when officers received information that John had been found and was being taken to a police station. John told his parents that he had sat on the bus in the depot for a time thinking the bus driver would come back and find him. Mr Robertson said: ""It was a mini bus, so he was able to open the door. ""He decided to get to the Kessock Bridge to get home. He said he crossed a couple of roads. Luckily two teachers found him. ""They said he was shaken up, cold and after some persuasion, because we've taught him not to talk to strangers, they managed to get him into their warm car."" Mr Robertson said he was proud of his son's actions. John has been getting a lift to and from school from a family friend since the incident. The four-year-old thought the driver would come to find him A spokeswoman for Highland Council said: ""We are extremely concerned about this incident and we are carrying out a full investigation into the circumstances with our contracted school transport provider. ""The incident is also the subject of an ongoing police investigation."" Earlier Black Isle councillor Gordon Adam told BBC Alba it was a concerning incident. He said he thought the boy had fallen asleep and woke up at the depot and was not seen by the driver. ""Somehow he got himself to the stadium, which in itself is very worrying as it would have involved crossing a main road,"" he added. D&E Coaches said it had carried out its own investigation of the incident. A spokesman said: ""We are extremely disappointed at the circumstances in which a child was left on one of our minibuses going from Munlochy Primary School to North Kessock last Friday when it was parked in a yard in Inverness. ""A full internal investigation has been conducted and the driver concerned has been dismissed for gross misconduct. ""Relying on an assurance from another pupil that this child was not on the bus is unacceptable. ""All drivers are expected to check their buses at the end of the journey but this clearly did not occur in this instance."" John ended up in the D&E Coaches' Inverness Longman depot In a response to the incident, the company has introduced a new course on Driver Awareness in School Contracts as part of the accreditation process for a driver licence. Long-term employees were being given refresher courses. The spokesman added: ""We wish to express our sincere apologies to the family of the child for the distress caused and we are extremely relieved that the child was safe and sound. ""D&E Coaches have been running school contracts for over 20 years and currently have 58 school contracts conveying 3,000 children a day to and from school. ""This is the first time anything of this nature has occurred to mar our excellent record and the new measures will enhance driver vigilance to try to ensure there is never a repeat.""

Fatal hit-and-run CCTV images issued,"The victim was hit on a pedestrian crossing on the South Circular Road near Norwood Road Police investigating a fatal hit-and-run in which a woman was struck four times have released CCTV images of vehicles they believe were involved. The victim, 29, was""left to die""on the pedestrian crossing, when all four drivers failed to stop, on Monday. She was hit as she crossed Norwood Road in Tulse Hill, in south London, as the traffic went through on a green light. The images show a white lorry - possibly a Mercedes, and a black car, similar to a Vauxhall SUV. Detectiveshave traced two driversallegedly involved but are still looking for the other two. One of the vehicles believed to be involved in the hit-and-run was a white lorry Police are urging the driver to come forward Two of the four drivers have been traced so far The victim, who was Polish and staying with family in Wandsworth, was struck by one lorry, before being hit by a second lorry and two cars, the Metropolitan Police believe. She was treated by paramedics but died from her injuries, less than an hour after she was fatally injured at about 06:45 GMT on Monday. Her family is due in the UK later, to enable her to be formally identified. Police interviewed the 49-year-old male driver of the first lorry under caution and arrested the 52-year-old male driver of the second car on Tuesday. He was detained on suspicion of causing death by careless driving and later released under investigation. The Met said it was ""grateful for all those witnesses who have come forward"". But, they are still seeking any dashcam footage from drivers who were in the Norwood Road area between 06:30 and 07:00 GMT. Acting Det Sgt Alastair Middleton, of the Met Police, said: ""We continue to appeal for anyone who was passing and witnessed the collision and the moments afterwards to contact us immediately. ""Enquiries are continuing to trace the two outstanding vehicles involved. A number of actions, including the recovery of local CCTV footage are in hand. I would urge the two drivers we are yet to trace come forward and speak with my team.""

A Brexit truce for Christmas?,"This video can not be played A ""ceasefire"" on insults is needed in arguments on Brexit, says Archbishop Justin Welby Brexit continues to divide the nation 18 months on from the EU referendum. So, in the spirit of the season - and after the Archbishop of Canterbury called for one - we decided to arrange a Christmas truce. Sir Vince Cable- the Liberal Democrat leader wants an ""exit from Brexit"" through a referendum on the final deal. ""Houses are going to lose so much value that millennials might actually be able to get their foot on the ladder in Brexit Britain."" Caroline Lucas- the Green Party's co-leader and its only MP is a former member of the European Parliament. ""Aside from seeing the UKIP MEPs lose their EU salaries, there really isn't much to celebrate about Brexit. If I had to pick one potential benefit it would be the chance to upgrade our farming policy to focus more on environmental protection, rather than the support for large scale agribusiness that has been central to the Common Agricultural Policy. ""British governments' record on the issue doesn't exactly inspire confidence - but I live in hope that we can reconfigure the subsidy system to support small scale and organic farmers more than before."" Chris Leslie -the Labour MP and former shadow chancellor is a leading member of Open Britain, the cross-party group campaigning for a ""soft Brexit"". ""If there is a silver lining, I'd say that Brexit has brought together politicians from across the traditional party political divide who weren't working together previously - but are now. ""There is a growing alliance between moderate politicians from all parties who are finding new common ground, defending values of pro-European free trade and internationalism, something that wasn't so evident before Brexit. ""In terms of the wider public debate, Brexit has also provoked a wider awareness of international trade and global economics which many people weren't familiar with until recently."" Gisela Stuart- As co-chair of the Vote Leave campaign, the Labour MP toured the UK with Boris Johnson and Michael Gove. She converted to the Eurosceptic cause after helping to draft an EU constitution in Brussels. ""I shall miss the European Council meetings - seeing all the European politicians sitting around a table trying to thrash things out and seek common solutions. They don't always achieve it but it's good that they keep trying. ""I will also miss hearing Beethoven's 9th Symphony (the EU anthem), the finest piece of music ever written."" Steven Woolfe- the Mancunian was once touted as the man most likely to succeed Nigel Farage as the next UKIP leader until a spectacular falling out with the party. He now sits as an independent in the European Parliament. ""The EU actually tried to create the removal of all barriers to trade and therefore it has helped ambitious UK companies to expand and grow their exports. I don't think we should shy away from the positive influence of this, which supported the growth of companies in the UK. I hope now we can carry on building that and go global. ""But the EU wasn't just about trade, it was also about political unification and I think if that hadn't happened we would still be in."" Patrick O'Flynn -the UKIP MEP gave up a career as the Daily Express's political correspondent to fight for Brexit. ""I will miss the very many lovely people who work in the Parliament, including colleagues in the EFDD group, from other countries. ""Leaving is nothing personal, it's just that the British public have reached the end of their tolerance for political integration and building a super-state. We can keep the things that we need. We might be able to opt into a number of programmes if it is decided they are good value for money. ""The EU was useful in the middle of the 20th Century to prevent war between France and Germany but I don't suppose the UK leaving is going to make that a concern now.""

Parents give children alcohol 'too young',"Some parents give their children alcohol from an early age Parents could be storing up problems for their children by introducing them to alcohol too young and ordering takeaways too often, researchers warn. Two universities found that one in six parents gives their children alcohol by the age of 14,,externalwhen their body and brain are not yet fully developed. Many parents may believe they are acting responsibly - but that's not backed up by research, experts said. Regular takeaways were a risk to the heart,a separate study said.,external A team of researchers from St George's, University of London, surveyed nearly 2,000 nine and 10-year-olds on their diets and found that one in four ate takeaways at least once a week. This group had higher body fat composition from consuming too many calories, and lower levels of vitamins and minerals than children who ate food cooked at home. Eating too many takeaway meals increases children's calorie intake Continuing on this kind of diet could increase the risk of heart disease and other health problems later in life, the research team warned, saying takeaways should be ""actively discouraged"". When it comes to giving adolescents a taste of alcohol, well-educated parents of white children are the main culprits, research published in the Journal of Adolescent Health suggests. But very few ethnic minority parents said they allowed early drinking - only 2%. Booze calculator: What's your drinking nationality? Who are the parents who let their children drink alcohol at home? Does glass size matter to wine drinkers? Using data on 10,000 children from theMillennium Cohort Study,,externalresearchers from from University College London and Pennsylvania State University found that light or moderate-drinking parents were just as likely to let their children drink alcohol as heavy-drinking parents. Prof Jennifer Maggs, lead study author, said: ""Parents of socially advantaged children may believe that allowing children to drink will teach them responsible use or may in fact inoculate them against dangerous drinking. ""However, there is little research to support these ideas."" Previous research has shown that those who start drinking early are more likely to do badly at school, have behaviour issues, and develop alcohol problems in adulthood. Official medical advice recommends that children don't drink alcohol until they are at least 15. Set clear rules for teenagers and booze, experts say In the survey, 14-year-olds themselves were asked whether they had ever tried more than a few sips of alcohol, with almost half saying yes. When they were 11, about 14% had done so. Katherine Brown, chief executive of the Institute of Alcohol Studies, said an alcohol-free childhood was best and this advice may not be getting to parents. ""We need to see better guidance offered to parents via social marketing campaigns and advice from doctors and schools. ""Parents deserve to know they can have a positive impact, and can reduce health harms associated with young people drinking."" Dr John Larsen, from the charity Drinkaware, said parents and guardians had an important role to play in helping children learn about alcohol. ""While each parent or carer may choose to approach talking to their teenagers about alcohol in different ways, it is helpful to have clear rules and that the conversations are open and honest."" Get the tone right - make it a conversation, not a lecture Get the timing right - don't wait until they are going out of the door to meet friends Find a hook - like a recent film or TV storyline to start the conversation Be honest - it's far better to confess to what you did at their age Set rules - teenagers feel safer if there are guidelines and boundaries Drinkaware has more tips onstrategies to prevent underage drinking.,external Does glass size matter to wine drinkers?

Church apology over bishop abuse inquiryFormer Bishop of Chichester George Bell was accused of sexual abuse decades after his death in 1958.,"George Bell was Bishop of Chichester from 1929 until his death in 1958 The Church of England has apologised to the relatives of a bishop for the way it investigated child abuse claims made against him decades after his death. Former Bishop of Chichester George Bell, who died in 1958, was alleged to have repeatedly abused a young girl. She made a formal complaint in 1995 and, 10 years later, won an apology and compensation from the Church. Areport,externalinto the handling of the case has criticised the Church's actions, describing its process as ""deficient"". The current Bishop of Chichester the Right Reverend Martin Warner praised the ""dignity and integrity"" of Bishop Bell's accuser, but said the Church inquiry paid ""inadequate attention to the rights of those who are dead"". In his review, Lord Carlile said the Church ""failed to follow a process that was fair and equitable to both sides"". The allegations against George Bell were first made by the victim, known as ""Carol"", in 1995, but were not investigated or referred to the police. She said the bishop began abusing her when she was five andmolested her in Chichester Cathedralas she sat listening to stories. Carol said the abuse continued for about four years. In 2013, she wrote to the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, at which point the matter was referred to police. Two years later the Church paid Â£16,800 in an out of court settlement and apologised to Carol. However, the ""George Bell Group"" of supporters of the former bishop sought and gained a review into how the Church arrived at that decision. 'Rights of the bishop' Lord Carlile criticised the Church response as ""deficient"" in a number of respects and said the most significant was that ""it failed to follow a process that was fair and equitable to both sides"". He said the Church should be ready to acknowledge sexual abuse committed by the clergy - but that did not mean the reputations of the dead were without value. The independent reviewer said even when alleged perpetrators had died there should be methodical and sufficient investigations. He said in this case it was ""clear that the Crown Prosecution Service evidential charging standard... would not have been met"". Making 15 recommendations, Lord Carlile concluded the Church, feeling it should be supportive of the complainant and transparent in its dealings, failed to engage in a process that gave proper consideration to the rights of the bishop. The review recommended alleged perpetrators, living or dead, should not be identified unless adverse findings of fact are found, or it is in the public interest. It said: ""Whereas in this case the settlement is without admission of liability, the settlement generally should be with a confidentiality provision."" But the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said: ""The decision to publish his name was taken with immense reluctance, and all involved recognised the deep tragedy involved. However, we have to differ from Lord Carlile's point. ""The Church of England is committed to transparency and therefore we would take a different approach."" Bishop Warner said: ""We welcome Lord Carlile's assessment of our processes, and apologise for failures in the work of the Core Group of national and diocesan officers and its inadequate attention to the rights of those who are dead.

"Minimum price 'will affect 70% of alcohol'There will be sharp increase in the cost of alcohol if a minimum price is introduced, say researchers.2h2 hours agoBusinessComments","Introducing a minimum price per unit of alcohol would push up the cost to consumers of most alcohol, not just the cheapest strong drinks, according to researchers. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said a floor of 50p per unit would raise the cost of 70% of alcohol bought in shops. It said there was a ""strong case"" for reforming alcohol duties instead. The Scottish government is due to bring in a minimum price for alcohol in May. It is consulting on its preferred rate of 50p per unit. A similar policy is being considered by the Welsh National Assembly. Parents giving children alcohol too young, say researchers Booze calculator: What's your drinking nationality? The IFS looked at what the impact on prices would be if a compulsory minimum price of at least 50p per alcohol unit were introduced, meaning that drinks that currently cost less than that would have to go up in price. It found the average price rise would be about 35%, but low-cost lagers would increase by 44%, while most ciders would cost 90% more. Will Scots go on 'booze cruises' to England? Watch: Minimum pricing won't put off dependent people, says recovering alcoholic Minimum alcohol price 'could hit drinkers on low incomes' About 85% of lager and 80% of cider (measured by units of alcohol) are priced below 50p per unit. The IFS said most wines, fortified wines and spirits also cost less than 50p per unit and would see their prices go up. For example, a bottle of sherry containing 17.5 units of alcohol and sold for Â£7.15 by a supermarket would have to be sold for Â£8.75 if a minimum price of 50p per unit were introduced. Twenty cans of cider containing 44 units of alcohol, currently available for Â£11, would double in price to Â£22. The researchers concluded that a minimum price of 50p would have a financial impact on heavy drinkers who tend to buy cheaper and stronger alcohol. But it would also affect a large number of moderate drinkers. However, the IFS said ""it may be better to reform duties and not have a minimum price at all"". It said minimum unit pricing had a ""substantial disadvantage"" because the policy was ""likely to dampen competition in the retail market, resulting in increases in profits to the alcohol industry. ""In contrast, reform of alcohol duties that act to raise the price of strong products, as well as cider, is likely to raise tax revenue,"" it added. Anomalies in the current UK alcohol duty system made it ""chaotic"", it said. At the moment, for example, EU rules mean wine and cider have to be taxed per litre, with the result they are taxed less per unit of alcohol than stronger drinks. Separately, the tax on a litre of 7.5% beer is three times that on a litre of 7.5 % cider. ""A sensible reform that would substantially improve the system of alcohol duties would entail taxing directly the alcohol in wine and cider (a move which exiting the European Union will presumably make legally feasible) and increasing the tax on cider to bring it in line with that levied on beer,"" it said. Any change to the system of alcohol duty would be under the control of government in Westminster.

Australia sexual abuse 'a national tragedy',"This video can not be played Abuse survivor Andrew Collins recounts his story A five-year inquiry into sexual abuse in Australia has released its final report, saying institutions had ""seriously failed"" to protect children. The royal commission, Australia's highest form of public inquiry, heard more than 8,000 testimonies from victims of abuse. The accusations covered churches, schools and sports clubs over decades. Among more than 400 recommendations, the report calls on the Catholic Church to overhaul its celibacy rules. ""Tens of thousands of children have been sexually abused in many Australian institutions. We will never know the true number,"" the report said. ""It is not a case of a few 'rotten apples'. Society's major institutions have seriously failed."" Since 2013, the royal commission has referred more than 2,500 allegations to authorities. The final report, released on Friday, added 189 recommendations to 220 that had already been made public. The proposals will now be considered by legislators. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said ""a national tragedy"" had been exposed. 'I can now pick up the pieces of my life': read what survivors have to say The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse had the power to look at any private, public or non-government body involved with children. It was contacted by more than 15,000 people. More than 8,000 victims told their stories, many for the first time in private sessions. The commission also received more than 1,300 written accounts and held 57 public hearings across the nation. Allegations were raised against more than 4,000 institutions. Religious ministers and school teachers were the most commonly reported perpetrators, the report said. The greatest number were in Catholic institutions. Catholic Church 'abused 4,400 children' in Australia Anglican Church receives 1,115 abuse complaints Jehovah's Witness church 'hid 1,000 alleged abusers' The commission had previously recommended thatCatholic clerics should face criminal charges if they fail to report sexual abusedisclosed to them during confession. The final report on Friday urged Australian Catholic bishops to petition the Vatican to amend canon law to allow priests to report such disclosures. It also said the Catholic Church should consider making celibacy voluntary for priests because while it was ""not a direct cause of child sexual abuse"", it had ""contributed to the occurrence of child sexual abuse, especially when combined with other risk factors"". The BBC's Hywel Griffith in Sydney said applying mandatory reporting to confession would trigger debate across the Catholic world, and has raised questions for bodies far beyond Australia's borders. Read more: Acting on Australia's landmark abuse inquiry Among its other major findings, the inquiry recommended: A nationally implemented strategy to prevent child sex abuse A system of preventative training for children in schools and early childhood centres A national office for child safety, overseen by a government minister Making it mandatory for more occupations, such as religious ministers, early childhood workers and registered psychologists, to report abuse. Supporters of the inquiry gather in Canberra on Friday Throughout the inquiry, many leaders of institutions admitted failures and apologised to victims on behalf of their groups. On Friday, the president of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference, Archbishop Denis Hart, offered an ""unconditional"" apology. ""This is a shameful past, in which a prevailing culture of secrecy and self-protection led to unnecessary suffering for many victims and their families,"" he said. However, he rejected changing the rules on confession. ""The seal of the confessional, or the relationship with God that's carried through the priest and with the person, is inviolable,"" he said. Spotlight on the secrecy of confession On the call for voluntary celibacy, he said it was up to the Vatican to decide. ""It's a discipline which the church can change,""he told Fairfax Media.,external But Sydney's Catholic Archbishop Antony Fisher told reporters that child sexual abuse was ""an issue for everyone, celibate or not"", saying the problem also occurred in families and institutions with non-celibate clergy. Australia's most senior Anglican figure, Melbourne Archbishop Dr Philip Freier, apologised for ""our failures and by the shameful way we sometimes actively worked against and discouraged those who came to us and reported abuse"". ""Gerry Ann"" said she ""lived in a climate of fear"" at the orphanage where she grew up. ""My time at [the orphanage] robbed me of my innocence, and set the benchmark of who I would become: frightened, petrified, scared, fearful, not worthy, introverted, isolated, segregated, sad and constantly suicidal."" ""Toby"" shared a cabin with four other boys at a primary school camp. During shower time he was sexually abused by two of the boys he was sharing his cabin with. He told his mother that the abuse had involved ""putting penises in his bottom"", and that he had told this to the deputy principal at camp. ""Brianna"" has spent her childhood in out-of-home care. She said at age five, she remembered being physically beaten. Her foster father, ""Sherman"", beat her with a pool cue as her sister hid under the table. He began sexually abusing her soon after she moved in. Brianna said that on at least one occasion, her foster mother encouraged Brianna's sister to sleep in Sherman's bed. Like many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander survivors in out-of-home care, ""Raquel"" was subjected to harsh treatment by the foster family, describing them as ""cruel pigs"". She said she was whipped with a bamboo stick among other physical and emotional abuses. *Names have been changed in the report to protect the identities of the survivors.

Ryanair moves towards recognising unions,"Ryanair has said it is prepared to recognise pilot unions as it seeks to avoid strike disruption over the Christmas period. Earlier this week, 79 Dublin-based Ryanair pilots said they would strike for one day on 20 December. The airline was also facing action by pilots elsewhere in Europe. Ryanair has never recognised unions, but it said it would change this policy in order to avoid disruption to flights and passengers in Christmas week. It has written to pilot unions in Ireland, the UK, Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal inviting them for talks. On Friday afternoon,Irish union Impact, which represents pilots,,externalsaid it had ""made contact with"" Ryanair management after receiving a letter from the airline. ""Impact has indicated its belief that an immediate meeting, between management and the union, is now necessary to clarify issues and make progress."" The union said its officials were available ""today or at any time over the coming weekend"". However, they have not called off next week's strike action in Ireland. The UK pilots' union Balpa, which was not planning to strike next week, said it had written to Ryanair to accept the offer of talks. This video can not be played Ryanair tells Today the airline is moving to recognise unions as it's ""time for change"" The carrier said it would recognise unions ""as the representative body for pilots in Ryanair in each of these countries, as long as they establish committees of Ryanair pilots to deal with Ryanair issues, as Ryanair will not engage with pilots who fly for competitor airlines in Ireland or elsewhere"". Ryanair chief operations officer Peter Bellew told the BBC there were ""no strings"" attached to the offer. ""The basis of what we've asked to do is the same as other airlines do around the world and within Europe, so I don't believe there's any strings there."" Ryanair called on the unions to cancel the planned strike on 20 December. However, Mr Bellew said the offer to hold talks about collective bargaining was not just about next week's planned strikes. ""This is about the long term. We have 4,500 pilots working for Ryanair at the moment, great aviation professionals, we need to get a basis with them to work going forward. ""We feel it's the best grounds to move forward with our workforce for the next 10/20 years where we intend to grow to be the biggest airline in the world."" Ryanair's share price fell 8.6% after the invitation to talks became public, amid investors' fears that any change could push up costs. Mr Bellew said: ""I think there might be some minor changes but I don't think it's going to be material in the overall cost of the company."" Pilots in Italy had been due to strike on Friday for four hours, between 13:00 and 17:00 CET (12:00-16:00 GMT). However, following receipt of the letter from Ryanair, the main pilots' union, Anpac, said it had suspended its walkout. Chief executive Michael O'Leary admitted union recognition would be a ""significant change"" for the airline. ""Christmas flights are very important to our customers and we wish to remove any worry or concern that they may be disrupted by pilot industrial action next week,"" he said. ""If the best way to achieve this is to talk to our pilots through a recognised union process, then we are prepared to do so."" In October, Mr O'Leary wrote to the Ryanair's pilots to offer them better pay and conditions after the airline was forced to cancel thousands of flights. At the time of the cancellations the airline admitted it had ""messed up"" the planning of its pilots' holidays. In his letter, Mr O'Leary also apologised for changes that caused disruptions to their rotas and urged them not to leave the airline. Aviation expert John Strickland of JLS Consulting said the idea of Ryanair recognising unions was ""revolutionary"" for the company. ""I think the company realises they need to pay more, they recognise it's a labour group who they cannot do without, they cannot simply replace pilots off the street on a short-term basis. ""There's a global pilot shortage and Ryanair is actually pretty well placed in the pecking order for pilot jobs but they have to make sure these people are on side and not inflame personal feelings with that part of the workforce,"" he added.

BBC appoints new head of news,"Fran Unsworth has been appointed the new BBC director of news and current affairs, replacing James Harding, who is leaving at the beginning of 2018. Unsworth is currently director of the BBC World Service Group and deputy director of news and current affairs. She started her BBC career in local radio, before moving to Newsbeat. She went on to become head of political programmes and then newsgathering. After four years at the BBC,Harding is setting up his own news media venture. Amol Rajan: Fran Unsworth's hellish new job BBC director general Tony Hall described the role as ""one of the most demanding of any in broadcasting"", saying he was ""delighted she is taking up the role"". ""She brings a combination of excellent news judgement, authority, management knowhow, and the trust of her colleagues both in news and across the BBC,"" he added. The job of director for news and current affairs, which has been accepted by Fran Unsworth, is undoubtedly one of the biggest in British, some would say international, journalism. It is also, by all accounts, an invitation to hell. Despite being one of the most powerful jobs in journalism, the job is not wholly, or even mainly, editorial. If you are in charge of a particular programme, or publication, the idea is that as editor you get to focus on the exciting business of editorial judgement: what stories, pictures, campaigns, headlines to use and so on. Unfortunately, the sorry financial state of much modern media means that editors' time is increasingly spent doing less fun things, like begging advertisers for money, or sacking people. At the BBC, however, there is a whole other world of pain, and rightly too: as an organisation owned by the public, every penny has to be accounted for, and most of the decision making too. Read the blog in full. James Harding came to the BBC from The Times newspaper Unsworth said she was ""delighted"", adding: ""We are living through a period of significant change at home and abroad. In a complex world, the BBC's journalism matters more than ever. ""I am proud to lead a team of such dedicated and talented people."" Unsworth, who will sit on theBBC's executive committee, will take up the role at the start of the new year. In the past year she has overseen thebiggest expansionof theWorld Servicesince the 1940s, adding 12 new global language services includingKoreanandPidgin.

HS2 redundancy pay 'a shocking waste',"A computer generated image of an HS2 train on the Birmingham and Fazeley viaduct Unauthorised redundancy payments made by the state-owned company managing the HS2 rail project were a ""shocking waste of taxpayers' money"", MPs have said. The Public Accounts Committee said the firm overseeing construction of a high-speed rail line offered staff terms ""well in excess"" of authorised levels. The MPs blamed ""weak internal processes"" at HS2 for overpayments to 94 people totalling Â£1.76m. An HS2 spokesperson acknowledged ""a serious error"" had been made. The company made the payments in 2016-17 after shedding 94 staff in a move from London to Birmingham. A combination of compulsory and voluntary redundancy schemes were offered on enhanced terms, resulting in a total bill of Â£2.76m, despite instructions from the Department of Transport that they should be at statutory rates, which would have incurred payments of Â£1m, MPs on the committee said. The MPs' report says that HS2's chief executive at the time, Simon Kirby, had an email from the government telling him that he wasn't allowed to offer staff larger, enhanced redundancy payments when the firm relocated. But it says Mr Kirby didn't pass that email on to anyone else. However, Mr Kirby - who now works at Rolls Royce - said in a statement that he had not been responsible for the decision to approve more generous severance packages. ""I did not approve the payments at issue and deny any allegation of wrongdoing,"" he said. ""I left HS2 in December last year and the decision to make senior managers redundant, and under what terms, was not made until after I left."" MPs concluded a lack of basic financial controls at HS2 Ltd heightened the risk of fraud and financial errors, a situation it said was exacerbated by high rates of staff turnover. ""The unauthorised schemes were able to proceed because weak internal processes at HS2 Ltd prevented key decision-making and scrutiny bodies from receiving accurate information,"" the committee said. The HS2 rail link being built between London, Manchester and Leeds, via Birmingham has already proved controversial for its impact on communities in the path of the new line, over its environmental impact and for its Â£55.7bn price tag. What do we know about HS2? The HS2 spokesperson said: ""HS2 is on track and has achieved a lot in its short lifespan. It has been able to do so because of our ability to have the right people in the right jobs at the right time. ""But while that was the reason for these payments it is clear that we got the process wrong and we are now putting the right systems in place to make sure that does not happen again."" A Department for Transport spokesperson said: ""We have made clear to HS2 Ltd in the strongest terms that we expect them to always meet their obligations and responsibilities to the taxpayer. ""As the NAO said this was a failure in the internal process at HS2 Ltd that resulted in these payments being made without approval in place. ""The Department has received legal advice that bringing a claim against Mr Kirby for breaching his duties and responsibilities as CEO and director of HS2 Ltd would not be justified.""

UK to stay in Erasmus scheme,"The UK will continue to take part in the Erasmus student exchange programme until at least the end of 2020, the prime minister has said. Theresa May praised Erasmus+ and confirmed the UK would still be involved after Brexit in March 2019. Whether it is involved long term is among issues likely to be discussed during the next stage of negotiations. Erasmus+ sees students study in another European country for between three and 12 months as part of their degree. The prime minister is in Brussels where she will have dinner with EU leaders on Thursday. May: We're on course to deliver Brexit On Friday, without Mrs May, they are expected to formally approve a recommendation that ""sufficient progress"" has been made in Brexit negotiations so far to move them onto the next stage. Mrs May agreed a draft deal with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker last week which would mean the UK would continue its funding of EU projects, including Erasmus, until the end of this EU budget period in 2020. If EU leaders approve the draft deal, Brexit negotiations can begin on the next phase, covering the future relationship between the UK and EU and a two-year transition or implementation deal from March 2019. It is not clear whether this would include Erasmus+. Mrs May said that British students benefitted from studying in the EU while UK universities were a popular choice for European students. Speaking during a discussion on education and culture at the summit in Brussels, she added: ""I welcome the opportunity to provide clarity to young people and the education sector and reaffirm our commitment to the deep and special relationship we want to build with the EU.""

US woman 'laundered bitcoin for IS',"Bitcoin can be purchased online or via special ATMs A New York woman has been accused of laundering bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and wiring the money to help the so-called Islamic State. Zoobia Shahnaz, 27, was charged with bank fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering and money laundering and is being held without bail. Ms Shahnaz was born in Pakistan and worked as a lab technician in the US. Prosecutors say she took out fraudulent loans of $85,000 (Â£63,000) in order to buy the bitcoin online. Bitcoin is an online currency. Despite not being legal tender, the value of bitcoin has rocketed this year. What is Bitcoin? It has been exploited by criminals to launder money. British authorities are pushing to increase regulation of the currency. According to court records, Ms Shahnaz, who lives in Brentwood on Long Island, was a lab technician at a Manhattan hospital until June. Prosecutors said that Ms Shahnaz obtained a Pakistani passport in July and booked a flight to Pakistan with a layover in Istanbul, intending to travel to Syria. She was arrested at John F Kennedy airport carrying $9,500 in cash, just under the limit of $10,000 that a person can legally take out of the country without declaring the funds. Searches of her electronic devices showed numerous searches for Islamic State-related material. Ms Shahnaz faces up to 20 years in prison on each of the money laundering charges and up to 30 years for the bank fraud charge. Her lawyer, Steve Zissou, said she was sending money overseas to help Syrian refugees. ""What she saw made her devoted to lessening the suffering of a lot of the Syrian refugees and everything she does is for that purpose,"" Mr Zissou said outside the courthouse. What is Bitcoin?

Ryanair moves towards recognise pilot unions,"Ryanair has said it is prepared to recognise pilot unions as it seeks to avoid strike disruption over the Christmas period. Earlier this week, 79 Dublin-based Ryanair pilots said they would strike for one day on 20 December. The airline was also facing action by pilots elsewhere in Europe. Ryanair has never recognised unions, but it said it would change this policy in order to avoid disruption to flights and passengers in Christmas week. It has written to pilot unions in Ireland, the UK, Germany, Italy, Spain and Portugal inviting them for talks. On Friday afternoon,Irish union Impact, which represents pilots,,externalsaid it had ""made contact with"" Ryanair management after receiving a letter from the airline. ""Impact has indicated its belief that an immediate meeting, between management and the union, is now necessary to clarify issues and make progress."" The union said its officials were available ""today or at any time over the coming weekend"". However, they have not called off next week's strike action in Ireland. The UK pilots' union Balpa, which was not planning to strike next week, said it had written to Ryanair to accept the offer of talks. This video can not be played Ryanair tells Today the airline is moving to recognise unions as it's ""time for change"" The carrier said it would recognise unions ""as the representative body for pilots in Ryanair in each of these countries, as long as they establish committees of Ryanair pilots to deal with Ryanair issues, as Ryanair will not engage with pilots who fly for competitor airlines in Ireland or elsewhere"". Ryanair chief operations officer Peter Bellew told the BBC there were ""no strings"" attached to the offer. ""The basis of what we've asked to do is the same as other airlines do around the world and within Europe, so I don't believe there's any strings there."" Ryanair called on the unions to cancel the planned strike on 20 December. However, Mr Bellew said the offer to hold talks about collective bargaining was not just about next week's planned strikes. ""This is about the long term. We have 4,500 pilots working for Ryanair at the moment, great aviation professionals, we need to get a basis with them to work going forward. ""We feel it's the best grounds to move forward with our workforce for the next 10/20 years where we intend to grow to be the biggest airline in the world."" Ryanair's share price fell 8.6% after the invitation to talks became public, amid investors' fears that any change could push up costs. Mr Bellew said: ""I think there might be some minor changes but I don't think it's going to be material in the overall cost of the company."" Pilots in Italy had been due to strike on Friday for four hours, between 13:00 and 17:00 CET (12:00-16:00 GMT). However, following receipt of the letter from Ryanair, the main pilots' union, Anpac, said it had suspended its walkout. Chief executive Michael O'Leary admitted union recognition would be a ""significant change"" for the airline. ""Christmas flights are very important to our customers and we wish to remove any worry or concern that they may be disrupted by pilot industrial action next week,"" he said. ""If the best way to achieve this is to talk to our pilots through a recognised union process, then we are prepared to do so."" In October, Mr O'Leary wrote to the Ryanair's pilots to offer them better pay and conditions after the airline was forced to cancel thousands of flights. At the time of the cancellations the airline admitted it had ""messed up"" the planning of its pilots' holidays. In his letter, Mr O'Leary also apologised for changes that caused disruptions to their rotas and urged them not to leave the airline. Aviation expert John Strickland of JLS Consulting said the idea of Ryanair recognising unions was ""revolutionary"" for the company. ""I think the company realises they need to pay more, they recognise it's a labour group who they cannot do without, they cannot simply replace pilots off the street on a short-term basis. ""There's a global pilot shortage and Ryanair is actually pretty well placed in the pecking order for pilot jobs but they have to make sure these people are on side and not inflame personal feelings with that part of the workforce,"" he added.

Star system has record eight exoplanets,"Artwork: the Kepler-90 system is the first to tie with our Solar System in number of planets Nasa has found a distant star circled by eight planets, equal to the complement in our own Solar System. It's the largest number of worlds ever discovered in a planetary system outside our own. The star known as Kepler-90, is just a bit hotter and larger than the Sun; astronomers already knew of seven planets around it. The newly discovered world is small enough to be rocky, according to scientists. ""This makes Kepler-90 the first star to host as many planets as our own Solar System,"" said Christopher Shallue, a software engineer at Google, which contributed to the discovery. Star's seven Earth-sized worlds set record Engineers from Google used a type of artificial intelligence called machine learning to find planets that were missed by previous searches. Kepler-90 and our Solar System compared Artwork: The Kepler telescope was launched to detect new worlds using the ""transit method"" The discovery was based on observations gathered by Nasa's Kepler Space Telescope. Its parent star is very distant, lying 2,545 light-years away. But its planetary system appears to be ordered in a similar way to our own. Andrew Vanderburg, a co-discoverer at the University of Texas at Austin, said: ""The Kepler-90 star system is like a mini version of our Solar System. You have small planets inside and big planets outside, but everything is scrunched in much closer."" To give a sense of how close, the outermost planet in the system orbits at around the same distance the Earth does from the Sun. Because the new world, dubbed Kepler-90i, is so much further in - it completes one circuit of its star every 14.4 days - it's estimated to have a scorching hot surface temperature of around 425C. The machine learning technique was also used to find a new Earth-sized planet, called Kepler 80g, around a different star. Some 3,500 exoplanets - worlds circling other stars - have been documented in recent decades.

Minimum price 'will affect 70% of alcohol',"Introducing a minimum price per unit of alcohol would push up the cost to consumers of most alcohol, not just the cheapest strong drinks, according to researchers. The Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) said a floor of 50p per unit would raise the cost of 70% of alcohol bought in shops. It said there was a ""strong case"" for reforming alcohol duties instead. The Scottish government is due to bring in a minimum price for alcohol in May. It is consulting on its preferred rate of 50p per unit. A similar policy is being considered by the Welsh National Assembly. Parents giving children alcohol too young, say researchers Booze calculator: What's your drinking nationality? The IFS looked at what the impact on prices would be if a compulsory minimum price of at least 50p per alcohol unit were introduced, meaning that drinks that currently cost less than that would have to go up in price. It found the average price rise would be about 35%, but low-cost lagers would increase by 44%, while most ciders would cost 90% more. Will Scots go on 'booze cruises' to England? Watch: Minimum pricing won't put off dependent people, says recovering alcoholic Minimum alcohol price 'could hit drinkers on low incomes' About 85% of lager and 80% of cider (measured by units of alcohol) are priced below 50p per unit. The IFS said most wines, fortified wines and spirits also cost less than 50p per unit and would see their prices go up. For example, a bottle of sherry containing 17.5 units of alcohol and sold for Â£7.15 by a supermarket would have to be sold for Â£8.75 if a minimum price of 50p per unit were introduced. Twenty cans of cider containing 44 units of alcohol, currently available for Â£11, would double in price to Â£22. The researchers concluded that a minimum price of 50p would have a financial impact on heavy drinkers who tend to buy cheaper and stronger alcohol. But it would also affect a large number of moderate drinkers. However, the IFS said ""it may be better to reform duties and not have a minimum price at all"". It said minimum unit pricing had a ""substantial disadvantage"" because the policy was ""likely to dampen competition in the retail market, resulting in increases in profits to the alcohol industry. ""In contrast, reform of alcohol duties that act to raise the price of strong products, as well as cider, is likely to raise tax revenue,"" it added. Anomalies in the current UK alcohol duty system made it ""chaotic"", it said. At the moment, for example, EU rules mean wine and cider have to be taxed per litre, with the result they are taxed less per unit of alcohol than stronger drinks. Separately, the tax on a litre of 7.5% beer is three times that on a litre of 7.5 % cider. ""A sensible reform that would substantially improve the system of alcohol duties would entail taxing directly the alcohol in wine and cider (a move which exiting the European Union will presumably make legally feasible) and increasing the tax on cider to bring it in line with that levied on beer,"" it said. Any change to the system of alcohol duty would be under the control of government in Westminster.

'Youthquake' is 2017 word of the year,"Jeremy Corbyn was said to have benefited from a ""youthquake"" after a surge in support from millennials Oxford Dictionaries has deemed ""youthquake"" the 2017 word of the year, reflecting what it calls a ""political awakening"" among millennial voters. It was first coined in the 1960s by Vogue editor Diana Vreeland, who used it to describe sudden changes in fashion, music and attitudes. Oxford Dictionaries said its use had seen a recent resurgence, to describe young people driving political change. Oxford Dictionaries' Casper Grathwohl said it was ""not an obvious choice"". But he said Youthquake's use in everyday speech had increased five-fold during 2017. ""In the UK, where it rose to prominence as a descriptor of the impact of the country's young people on its general election, calls it out as a word on the move,"" he said. Mr Grathwohl said youthquake's use in Britain peaked during the June general election, after polls delivered a better-than-expected result for the Labour party. Antifa- a short word for ""anti-fascist"" Broflake- a man who is readily upset by progressive attitudes, from the derogatory use of ""snowflake"" Kompromat- the Russian term for material used in blackmail Unicorn- adding rainbow colours to things - especially food Milkshake duck- a person or character on social media that appears to be endearing at first, but is found to have an unappealing back story Oxford Dictionaries said the word sounded a note of hope after what it described as a ""difficult and divisive year"". The word of the year is a word, or expression, that Oxford Dictionaries deems has ""attracted a great deal of interest during the year to date"" and is drawn from newspapers, books, blogs and transcripts of spoken English. Last year's word,""post-truth"", was chosen after the 2016 Brexit vote and Donald Trump's victory in the US presidential election. The Oxford English Dictionary has updated its definition of youthquake to: ""A significant cultural, political, or social change arising from the actions or influence of young."" It was previously defined as the ""series of radical political and cultural upheavals occurring among students and young people in the 1960s"".

Condom use 'low among under 25s'Public Health England launches a new campaign to get more people thinking about using condoms.2h2 hours agoNewsbeat,"A new campaign's being launched by Public Health England to get more under-25s to use condoms to prevent sexually transmitted infections spreading. It's the first government sexual health campaign in eight years. It comes as a survey carried out by PHE and YouGov revealed that almost half of sexually active young people have had sex with someone new for the first time without using a condom. One in 10 had never even used one. STIs can cause infertility, pelvic inflammatory disease, swollen or painful testicles and even meningitis. Public Health England and YouGov spoke to more than than 2,000 16-24-year-olds about their sexual health. The main reason for not using a condom was because they said sex felt better without one. Jordan, who's 19 and from Wrexham, admits he only uses them around ""half the time"". He told Newsbeat that being drunk was one of the reasons he hadn't used one with a new partner. ""Drink definitely has an effect, because when you're drunk, you're more careless."" The poll found half the people who admitted to not using a condom had done so when drunk. We also spoke to Lydia who admits she's more cautious when sober. Lydia says when she's drunk she's less likely to practise safe sex But she adds the feeling is ""not as nice"" when a partner uses a condom. Both admit to feeling guilty the day after having unprotected sex and have visited an STI clinic to get tested. Other reasons given in the survey for not using a condom during sex included one of a couple being on the pill or having a contraceptive implant. That's something student Ellie says is common. The 20-year-old admits some men she's slept with are far more worried about getting her pregnant than getting an STI. Ellie says men she's slept with are far more concerned about pregnancy than STIs ""It's on them then, isn't it? If it's a baby, it's them too. ""If it's an STI, it's your responsibility."" Jordan adds: ""If a girl's on the pill, then it's another way of saying 'you don't need to use a condom then'."" In 2016, there were more than 141,000 chlamydia and gonorrhoea diagnoses in people aged between 15 and 24 in England. Jesse, who's 24, told Newsbeat he contracted both because he didn't use a condom. Jesse admits he used to sleep around and didn't use protection ""It wasn't a nice experience. They caused pain in my groin and discomfort when urinating. ""The worst of it though was having to tell my previous and current sexual partner that I had contracted the STIs, so they also needed to get checked and treated. Symptoms vary but some, like chlamydia, may not even show any. ""I had symptoms, but I know there are so many people who don't have symptoms,"" says Jesse. ""Now when having sex with someone new I will definitely use a condom."" Doctors are worried because gonorrhoea is becoming increasingly resistant to antibiotics, andmay become untreatable in the future. GP Dr Sara Kayat says the only way to avoid getting an STI is to use a condom. Dr Sara Kayat is supporting Public Health England's campaign ""Whilst many STIs are symptomless, contracting them can have serious health consequences if left untreated and even lead to infertility. ""As I tell patients in my clinic every week, it's just not worth putting yourself at risk by not using a condom.""

"UK must tackle loneliness, says reportCommission set up by murdered MP Jo Cox says nine million adults in the UK are affected.9h9 hours agoUK","The government should create a national strategy to combat loneliness, says a report by a commission set up by the murdered MP Jo Cox. Thecommission,external, formed by the MP before she was killed in her constituency in 2016, calls for the appointment of a minister to lead action on the issue. It says loneliness is as harmful to health as smoking 15 cigarettes a day and affects nine million UK people. The government says new initiatives will be announced next year. The report acknowledges that government action alone cannot solve the problem. However, it says: ""Tackling loneliness is a generational challenge that can only be met by concerted action by everyone - governments, employers, businesses, civil society organisations, families, communities and individuals all have a role to play. ""Working together we can make a difference."" The report is calling for theFamily Test,external, a measure of assessing the effect of government policies on stable families, to become a family and relationships test. Remembering Jo Cox: Her family one year on Daughter's poem wins Jo Cox contest The cross-party commission was established by Mrs Cox when she was Labour MP for Batley and Spen. It continued its work after she was murdered outside her constituency office in Birstall, West Yorkshire in June 2016. The commission has been working with 13 charities including Age UK and Action for Children to come up with ideas for change. The report will be presented in Birstall on Friday by the joint commission chairs, Labour MP Rachel Reeves and the Conservative's Seema Kennedy, They will be joined by Mrs Cox's sister, Kim Leadbeater. Mrs Cox set up the commission before she was killed in 2016 The joint chairs said: ""We know that loneliness will not end until we all recognise the role we can play in making that happen. ""Jo always looked forwards, not back. She would have said that what matters most now are the actions, big and small, that people take in response to the commission's work."" The report's release will coincide with the launch of three Royal Voluntary Service projects set to tackle loneliness and isolation in Mrs Cox's former constituency. The schemes - partly financed by theJo Cox Fund,externalset up in her memory - will include lunch clubs, activities, and workshops as well as a new Community Connections Programme. This will ""match up volunteers with lonely people in the area"" according to Royal Voluntary Service's Chief Executive Catherine Johnstone, acting as a practical template for the commission's recommendations. The government said it welcomed the commission's work and tackling social isolation and loneliness is of ""huge importance"". A spokeswoman added: ""A number of government initiatives already help to reduce loneliness, such as improved mental health support and funding to create new green spaces for communities, but we are committed to doing more and look forward to setting out plans in the new year,"" she added.

French school bus cut in two in rail crash,"This video can not be played Footage of emergency vehicles at the scene of the crash A train and a school bus have collided near Perpignan in southern France, leaving at least four children dead. At least 18 people were injured, some of them critically, after the crash on a level crossing between Millas and Saint-FÃ©liu-d'Amont. The bus had picked up pupils from a nearby secondary school before it was hit by a train travelling at about 80km/h (50mph). Pictures from the scene showed the bus split in two by the force of the crash. Train operator SNCF said witnesses had reported seeing the barriers at the level crossing down at the time of the collision, although that was not confirmed. The bus, which had left the Christian Bourquin College in Millas, was on the crossing when it was hit by the train, which was travelling from Perpignan. Visibility was described as good. Four children died at the scene on Thursday. At one point local authorities said two 11-year-old girls had succumbed to their injuries on Friday morning, but later denied this report. A witness who was on the train told local news website l'IndÃ©pendant that ""it was a very violent crash - it seemed as if the train would derail"".,external Some 30 people were on the regional train at the time. Pictures from the scene showed the school bus sheared in two Investigators are waiting to interview the driver of the bus. She was slightly injured in the crash. The train driver also escaped serous injury. Carole Delga, president of the Occitanie regional council, said the level crossing had been upgraded recently and appeared to have been in very good condition.

EU leaders set to move Brexit to next stage,"The 27 other EU leaders have stressed there is still a long way to go EU leaders are expected to formally agree to start the next phase of Brexit negotiations later. It means talks can move on to the long-term relationship between the UK and EU, days after Theresa May suffered her first defeat in the House of Commons. The next round of talks on a transition period after the UK leaves in March 2019 could begin as early as next week. European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said this process would be ""significantly harder"". Mrs May was applauded by other leaders at dinner in Brussels on Thursday night after she made a speech urging the two sides to embrace the way ahead with ""creativity and ambition"". Brexitcast: What next? Can Leavers and Remainers call Christmas truce? What the EU Withdrawal Bill will do UK to stay in Erasmus scheme until at least 2020 The European Commission has said ""sufficient progress"" has been made on the first phase to move onto discussing the framework of a future relationship - including issues such as security and trade. Mr Juncker said the EU's initial priority was to ""formalise the agreement we have now"" on issues such as citizens' rights before starting negotiations on a future relationship after the UK leaves in March 2019. ""The second phase will be significantly harder than the first and the first was very difficult,"" he warned. This video can not be played May: We've won 35 out of 36 votes Speaking to reporters, German Chancellor Angela Merkel said progress had been made but there was ""much more work to be done and time is of the essence"". Under EU rules, the prime minister will not attend the meeting where the decision is formally confirmed. She has now returned to the UK.

She said she made ""no secret"" of wanting to move on to the next phase and to approaching it with ""ambition and creativity"". ""A particular priority should be agreement on the implementation period so that we can bring greater certainty to businesses in the UK and across the 27,"" she said. German chancellor Angela Merkel has warned ""time is of the essence"" In applauding Mrs May, Mr Juncker said her EU colleagues ""felt that she did make a big effort and this has to be recognised"" while Austrian Chancellor Christian Kern said he appreciated ""her efforts and engagement"". But Maltese PM Joseph Muscat said the UK must spell out ""very clearly"" what it wanted from its post-Brexit relationship with the EU for the talks to proceed smoothly. The text likely to be rubber-stamped by the leaders will promise to work towards a ""framework"" for a trade deal - with a wait until March before guidelines for the way ahead are produced. The document states that a formal free trade agreement cannot be signed until after the UK has left the EU. The talks will first prioritise translatingrecent headway on the issues of citizens' rights, the Irish border and the ""divorce bill""into a legally-binding withdrawal agreement - as well as to work out the terms for a transition period to follow the official date of Brexit.

The EU leaders will stay on to discuss the eurozone as the two-day summit draws to a close - having alsodebated the flow of migrants over the Mediterraneanand sanctions on Russia. Mrs May has said the Brexit process is still ""on course"" despite her defeat in a Parliamentary vote on Wednesday night. Speaking in Brussels, Mrs May said she was ""disappointed"" at the vote on the EU Withdrawal Bill, but the legislation was making ""good progress"". MPs backed an amendment giving them a legal guarantee of a vote on the final Brexit deal struck with Brussels. Ministers are due to have their first discussion of the ""end state"" relationship between UK and the EU in a cabinet meeting on Tuesday. Meanwhile, Mrs May is facing a further challenge next week when MPs vote on a government amendment to enshrine the Brexit date of 29 March 2019 in law. The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said there was no sign so far that Mrs May was going to budge on the issue but further compromises could be ""forced on her"".

Grenfell victims remembered at St Paul'sRoyal Family members joined the bereaved at the London memorial to pay tribute to the 71 victims.6h6 hours agoUK,"This video can not be played Grenfell memorial: Key moments Survivors of the Grenfell Tower fire have attended a memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral, alongside members of the Royal Family and PM Theresa May. Bereaved families, survivors and rescue workers were joined by the Prince of Wales, the Duchess of Cornwall, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and Prince Harry. Bishop of Kensington Graham Tomlin said he hoped the tragedy would represent a ""time we learnt a new, better way"". The fire, on 14 June, claimed 71 lives. Grief still raw as service remembers Grenfell Key moments as the fire spread Priceless pictures that survived the blaze Families' 'hotel prison' Memorial service as it happened The commemoration, marking six months since the tragedy, also gave thanks to all those who assisted at the time of the fire and since - including the emergency services, recovery teams, the community, public support workers and volunteers. Archbishop of Canterbury Justin Welby, Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn and singer Adele were also among the more than 1,500 guests. The families of victims held photographs of their loved ones outside the cathedral Singer Adele attended the service, among more than 1,500 guests As the memorial began, a Green For Grenfell banner adorned with a heart was carried into the cathedral. Opening the service ahead of a minute's silence, Dean of St Paul's Dr David Ison said: ""We come together as different faiths as we remember those whose lives were lost."" ""Be united in the face of suffering and sorrow,"" he added. He said the UK grieved ""at the unspeakable tragedy, loss and hurt of that June day"". The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge, Prince Harry, Prince Charles and the Duchess of Cornwall joined the congregation By Thomas Mackintosh, BBC News, at St Paul's Cathedral Six months on from the Grenfell Tower fire, the grief and anger of those affected is still visibly raw. Underneath the sadness there was dismay that many of the survivors attending the national memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral are still homeless. And while those who died in the fire were remembered, there was also comment on what has taken place since - and what more importantly still needs to be done. Grief still raw as service remembers Grenfell Families held photographs of victims of the fire, while voice recordings from people at the scene of the fire were played to the congregation. The Al-Sadiq and Al-Zahra Schools Girls' Choir then sang out the words: ""Never lose hope."" Graham Tomlin, Bishop of Kensington and organiser of the memorial, told the congregation: ""Today we ask why warnings were not heeded, why a community was left feeling neglected, uncared for, not listened to."" But he said he looked ahead to the New Year with ""hope"" of change from ""a city that didn't listen"". He said he hoped the word ""Grenfell"" would change from a symbol of ""sorrow, grief or injustice"" to ""a symbol of the time we learnt a new and better way - to listen and to love"". This video can not be played Ebony Steel band plays at Grenfell Memorial Choirs featuring local children performed during the service Before the service, Bishop Tomlin told the BBC: ""There was a very strong desire within the local community to have the service here, because faith is very important to a lot of people in the local area, and that can bring a real sense of strength to people."" One of those in attendance was Tiago Alves, who escaped the blaze with his family. He told BBC Breakfast his thoughts would be with bereaved families during the ""emotional"" memorial: ""Today is a day not about survivors; today is purely about the bereaved, their families and the loved ones they have lost."" He said the memorial would bring back a lot of awful memories for many people, but added: ""The reason we are doing this today is so that people never forget - we want people to remember."" Families stood on the steps of St Paul's after the service Many held white roses along with photographs of loved ones The Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall also attended the service A young girl lights a memorial candle among tributes laid for the victims Firefighters also paid respects Portobello Road Salvation Army Band and St Paul's Cathedral Choir performed during the service, and the Ebony Steel Band, frequent performers at the Notting Hill Carnival, played a verse of Leonard Cohen's Hallelujah. At the end of the service, bereaved families and survivors left the cathedral in silence, holding white roses. Clarrie Mendy, who lost her cousin Mary and Mary's daughter, Khadija Saye, in the fire, said the memorial was ""what the community needs, what the survivors need"". ""It is a very emotional day,"" she said. ""I just hope everybody will get something from it."" Councillor Elizabeth Campbell, leader of Royal Borough of Kensington and Chelsea, did not attend the service, after some families said they did not want the council there in an official capacity. However, a minute's silence was held outside the town hall in High Street Kensington as the memorial service began.

French school bus cut in two in rail crashAt least four children died and another 20 people were hurt in the collision in southern France.,"This video can not be played Footage of emergency vehicles at the scene of the crash A train and a school bus have collided near Perpignan in southern France, leaving at least four children dead. At least 18 people were injured, some of them critically, after the crash on a level crossing between Millas and Saint-FÃ©liu-d'Amont. The bus had picked up pupils from a nearby secondary school before it was hit by a train travelling at about 80km/h (50mph). Pictures from the scene showed the bus split in two by the force of the crash. Train operator SNCF said witnesses had reported seeing the barriers at the level crossing down at the time of the collision, although that was not confirmed. The bus, which had left the Christian Bourquin College in Millas, was on the crossing when it was hit by the train, which was travelling from Perpignan. Visibility was described as good. Four children died at the scene on Thursday. At one point local authorities said two 11-year-old girls had succumbed to their injuries on Friday morning, but later denied this report. A witness who was on the train told local news website l'IndÃ©pendant that ""it was a very violent crash - it seemed as if the train would derail"".,external Some 30 people were on the regional train at the time. Pictures from the scene showed the school bus sheared in two Investigators are waiting to interview the driver of the bus. She was slightly injured in the crash. The train driver also escaped serous injury. Carole Delga, president of the Occitanie regional council, said the level crossing had been upgraded recently and appeared to have been in very good condition. ""The level crossing was very visible,"" she said. SNCF said it had an automatic barrier with standard signals and was not considered particularly dangerous. But the grandmother of an injured 11-year-old girl who had been on the bus told a very different story. The girl said the barrier had not come down but remained raised.

US woman 'laundered bitcoin for IS'She is accused of taking out fraudulent bank loans and buying bitcoin to funnel cash to IS.11m11 minutes agoUS & Canada,"Bitcoin can be purchased online or via special ATMs A New York woman has been accused of laundering bitcoin and other cryptocurrencies and wiring the money to help the so-called Islamic State. Zoobia Shahnaz, 27, was charged with bank fraud, conspiracy to commit money laundering and money laundering and is being held without bail. Ms Shahnaz was born in Pakistan and worked as a lab technician in the US. Prosecutors say she took out fraudulent loans of $85,000 (Â£63,000) in order to buy the bitcoin online. Bitcoin is an online currency. Despite not being legal tender, the value of bitcoin has rocketed this year. What is Bitcoin? It has been exploited by criminals to launder money. British authorities are pushing to increase regulation of the currency. According to court records, Ms Shahnaz, who lives in Brentwood on Long Island, was a lab technician at a Manhattan hospital until June. Prosecutors said that Ms Shahnaz obtained a Pakistani passport in July and booked a flight to Pakistan with a layover in Istanbul, intending to travel to Syria. She was arrested at John F Kennedy airport carrying $9,500 in cash, just under the limit of $10,000 that a person can legally take out of the country without declaring the funds. Searches of her electronic devices showed numerous searches for Islamic State-related material. Ms Shahnaz faces up to 20 years in prison on each of the money laundering charges and up to 30 years for the bank fraud charge. Her lawyer, Steve Zissou, said she was sending money overseas to help Syrian refugees. ""What she saw made her devoted to lessening the suffering of a lot of the Syrian refugees and everything she does is for that purpose,"" Mr Zissou said outside the courthouse. What is Bitcoin?

Church apology over bishop abuse inquiryFormer Bishop of Chichester George Bell was accused of sexual abuse decades after his death in 1958.5m6 minutes agoSussex,"George Bell was Bishop of Chichester from 1929 until his death in 1958 The Church of England has apologised to the relatives of a bishop for the way it investigated child abuse claims made against him decades after his death. Former Bishop of Chichester George Bell, who died in 1958, was alleged to have repeatedly abused a young girl. She made a formal complaint in 1995 and, 10 years later, won an apology and compensation from the Church. Areport,externalinto the handling of the case has criticised the Church's actions, describing its process as ""deficient"". The current Bishop of Chichester the Right Reverend Martin Warner praised the ""dignity and integrity"" of Bishop Bell's accuser, but said the Church inquiry paid ""inadequate attention to the rights of those who are dead"". In his review, Lord Carlile said the Church ""failed to follow a process that was fair and equitable to both sides"". The allegations against George Bell were first made by the victim, known as ""Carol"", in 1995, but were not investigated or referred to the police. She said the bishop began abusing her when she was five andmolested her in Chichester Cathedralas she sat listening to stories. Carol said the abuse continued for about four years. In 2013, she wrote to the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, at which point the matter was referred to police. Two years later the Church paid Â£16,800 in an out of court settlement and apologised to Carol. However, the ""George Bell Group"" of supporters of the former bishop sought and gained a review into how the Church arrived at that decision. 'Rights of the bishop' Lord Carlile criticised the Church response as ""deficient"" in a number of respects and said the most significant was that ""it failed to follow a process that was fair and equitable to both sides"". He said the Church should be ready to acknowledge sexual abuse committed by the clergy - but that did not mean the reputations of the dead were without value. The independent reviewer said even when alleged perpetrators had died there should be methodical and sufficient investigations. He said in this case it was ""clear that the Crown Prosecution Service evidential charging standard... would not have been met"". Making 15 recommendations, Lord Carlile concluded the Church, feeling it should be supportive of the complainant and transparent in its dealings, failed to engage in a process that gave proper consideration to the rights of the bishop. The review recommended alleged perpetrators, living or dead, should not be identified unless adverse findings of fact are found, or it is in the public interest. It said: ""Whereas in this case the settlement is without admission of liability, the settlement generally should be with a confidentiality provision."" But the Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, said: ""The decision to publish his name was taken with immense reluctance, and all involved recognised the deep tragedy involved. However, we have to differ from Lord Carlile's point. ""The Church of England is committed to transparency and therefore we would take a different approach."" Bishop Warner said: ""We welcome Lord Carlile's assessment of our processes, and apologise for failures in the work of the Core Group of national and diocesan officers and its inadequate attention to the rights of those who are dead. ""The emotive principle of innocent until proven guilty is a standard by which our actions are judged and we have to ensure as best we can that justice is seen to be done. ""Irrespective of whether she is technically a complainant, survivor, or victim, 'Carol' emerges from this report as a person of dignity and integrity. ""It is essential that her right to privacy continues to be fully respected."" The Church also repeated its apology for failing to report Carol's allegations to the police when she first came forward in 1995.

"Scottish income tax changes unveiledHigher and middle earners will pay more than elsewhere in the UK, but lower earners will pay less.5h5 hours agoScotland politicsComments","Derek Mackay arrived in the Holyrood chamber alongside First Minister Nicola Sturgeon ahead of his budget speech The Scottish government has announced income tax changes that will see higher earners pay more than elsewhere in the UK - and lower earners pay less. The country's finance secretary, Derek Mackay, announced a new tax band of 21p for those earning more than Â£24,000. The higher rate of tax will be increased from 40p to 41p and the top rate from 45p to 46p. But a starter rate of 19p in the pound will also be introduced, Mr Mackay confirmed in his draft budget. Mr Mackay said the move to a five-band income tax system will mean no one earning less than Â£33,000 in Scotland will pay more tax than they do now. Scots budget: what does it mean for me? Mischievous Mackay's taxing budget Report: How was the budget unveiled? Scottish draft budget: At a glance Scottish economy facing 'subdued' growth And he told the Scottish Parliament that those earning above that figure would only pay a ""proportionate amount more"" than they currently do. His figures showed that 55% of Scottish taxpayers will pay less compared to south of the border under the new system - with 45% of people paying more. Someone in Scotland earning Â£150,000 will pay Â£1,774 more than if they lived elsewhere in the UK, with someone earning Â£40,000 paying Â£140 more. Accountancy body ICAS calculated that, of the 2.2 million basic rate taxpayers in Scotland, 1.4 million will be marginally better off than those in the rest of the UK whereas the remaining 800,000 will have a slightly increased tax bill. All 346,000 higher and 20,000 additional rate taxpayers will pay more. Mr Mackay also outlined how lifting the public-sector pay cap would allow for a 3% pay rise for public sector workers earning less than Â£30,000, and a 2% rise for those earning more than that - with a cap of Â£1,600 for those earning Â£80,000 or more. And he pledged a further Â£600m to provide superfast broadband to all premises in Scotland by 2021. The Scottish government was given powers over income tax rates and bands last year, with the new rates being paid by anyone who lives in Scotland. Mr Mackay had faced warnings from business leaders and the Scottish Conservatives ahead of his budget statement that Scotland could not afford to be associated with higher taxation than the rest of the UK. The finance secretary insisted the changes - which he said would raise an additional Â£164m - were necessary to ""mitigate UK budget cuts, protect our NHS and other public services, support our economy and tackle inequality in our society."" He said the tax reforms would make ""Scotland's income tax system even fairer and more progressive"". And he said a bigger increase in the top rate of tax for those earning more than Â£150,000 - which some opposition parties had called for - would actually reduce revenue as high earners would find ways to avoid paying it. Among the other measures in the budget were: Full relief from LBTT - the Scottish equivalent of stamp duty - on up to Â£175,000 for first time home buyers Funding to reduce the attainment gap in Scottish schools increased from Â£170m to Â£179m An increase in health funding of more than Â£400m - double the amount needed for NHS spending to keep pace with inflation Â£243m towards the expansion of free nursery education and childcare Local government resource budget will be protected in cash terms with the capital budget increased in real terms ""resulting in a total increase in local authority core funding of Â£94m"" Private schools will no longer be eligible for charitable relief from business rates, but universities and council arm's length bodies will be. Income tax. Public spending. Employment. Pay. The NHS. Schools. Indisputably, serious stuff. But there was more than a touch of mischief about Derek Mackay's demeanour as he got to the tax bits of his budget. Normally, he exudes gravitas, solemnity even. But he could not help playing to the gallery with a declaratory grin when he insisted that, for most people, Scotland would now be the lowest taxed part of the UK.

"Scottish income tax changes unveiledHigher and middle earners will pay more than elsewhere in the UK, but lower earners will pay less.","Derek Mackay arrived in the Holyrood chamber alongside First Minister Nicola Sturgeon ahead of his budget speech The Scottish government has announced income tax changes that will see higher earners pay more than elsewhere in the UK - and lower earners pay less. The country's finance secretary, Derek Mackay, announced a new tax band of 21p for those earning more than Â£24,000. The higher rate of tax will be increased from 40p to 41p and the top rate from 45p to 46p. But a starter rate of 19p in the pound will also be introduced, Mr Mackay confirmed in his draft budget. Mr Mackay said the move to a five-band income tax system will mean no one earning less than Â£33,000 in Scotland will pay more tax than they do now. Scots budget: what does it mean for me? Mischievous Mackay's taxing budget Report: How was the budget unveiled? Scottish draft budget: At a glance Scottish economy facing 'subdued' growth And he told the Scottish Parliament that those earning above that figure would only pay a ""proportionate amount more"" than they currently do. His figures showed that 55% of Scottish taxpayers will pay less compared to south of the border under the new system - with 45% of people paying more. Someone in Scotland earning Â£150,000 will pay Â£1,774 more than if they lived elsewhere in the UK, with someone earning Â£40,000 paying Â£140 more. Accountancy body ICAS calculated that, of the 2.2 million basic rate taxpayers in Scotland, 1.4 million will be marginally better off than those in the rest of the UK whereas the remaining 800,000 will have a slightly increased tax bill. All 346,000 higher and 20,000 additional rate taxpayers will pay more. Mr Mackay also outlined how lifting the public-sector pay cap would allow for a 3% pay rise for public sector workers earning less than Â£30,000, and a 2% rise for those earning more than that - with a cap of Â£1,600 for those earning Â£80,000 or more. And he pledged a further Â£600m to provide superfast broadband to all premises in Scotland by 2021. The Scottish government was given powers over income tax rates and bands last year, with the new rates being paid by anyone who lives in Scotland. Mr Mackay had faced warnings from business leaders and the Scottish Conservatives ahead of his budget statement that Scotland could not afford to be associated with higher taxation than the rest of the UK. The finance secretary insisted the changes - which he said would raise an additional Â£164m - were necessary to ""mitigate UK budget cuts, protect our NHS and other public services, support our economy and tackle inequality in our society."" He said the tax reforms would make ""Scotland's income tax system even fairer and more progressive"". And he said a bigger increase in the top rate of tax for those earning more than Â£150,000 - which some opposition parties had called for - would actually reduce revenue as high earners would find ways to avoid paying it. Among the other measures in the budget were: Full relief from LBTT - the Scottish equivalent of stamp duty - on up to Â£175,000 for first time home buyers Funding to reduce the attainment gap in Scottish schools increased from Â£170m to Â£179m An increase in health funding of more than Â£400m - double the amount needed for NHS spending to keep pace with inflation Â£243m towards the expansion of free nursery education and childcare Local government resource budget will be protected in cash terms with the capital budget increased in real terms ""resulting in a total increase in local authority core funding of Â£94m"" Private schools will no longer be eligible for charitable relief from business rates, but universities and council arm's length bodies will be. Income tax. Public spending. Employment. Pay. The NHS. Schools. Indisputably, serious stuff. But there was more than a touch of mischief about Derek Mackay's demeanour as he got to the tax bits of his budget. Normally, he exudes gravitas, solemnity even. But he could not help playing to the gallery with a declaratory grin when he insisted that, for most people, Scotland would now be the lowest taxed part of the UK. Said gallery - led enthusiastically by Mr Mackay's predecessor, John Swinney - applauded loudly. The reason for this glee? Politically, the claim is a direct and precise retort to Conservative attacks that Scotland is taxed more highly. But, of course, when the dust dies down, the Tories will return to that attack.

Walt Disney buys Murdoch's Fox for $52bn,"This video can not be played Andrew Neil tells us five things the $52.4bn (Â£39bn) tie-up could mean. Walt Disney has agreed to buy the bulk of 21st Century Fox's business for $52.4bn (Â£39bn), in a deal both companies said position them to compete in the rapidly changing media industry. The purchase includes Fox's film and television studios, as well as its 39% stake in satellite broadcaster Sky. Fox will form a news-focused company with its remaining assets. The move is a sharp shift for 86-year-old Fox owner Rupert Murdoch after more than half a century of media expansion. Simon Jack: Why is Disney buying Fox? Five reasons why the Murdochs are selling Fox to Disney Media Editor Amol Rajan: Cunning Fox and mighty Mouse Mr Murdoch turned a single Australian newspaper he inherited from his father at the age of 21 into one of the world's largest news and film empires. He said the break-up makes sense amid new threats from online advertising and competitors who are streaming entertainment into homes via the internet. Disney's long-standing chief executive Bob Iger struck the deal with Rupert Murdoch Fox shareholders, who include the Murdochs, will get a 25% stake in the larger Disney. ""With today's announcement, we launch the next great leg of our journey,"" Rupert Murdoch said on Thursday in a call for investors. He added later: ""Are we retreating? Absolutely not."" Disney will scoop up Fox's movie and television studios, regional sports network and international holdings, among other investments. The move adds to Disney's back catalogue high-grossing films such as the original Star Wars movies, the Marvel superhero pictures, Avatar and Deadpool, as well as TV hits such as Modern Family and The Simpsons. The Star Wars franchise will fall under one roof if the merger is completed It expands Disney's offerings with the FX and National Geographic cable channels, and Fox's regional sports network in the US. The purchase also extends Disney's global reach, adding media company Star India and Fox's interests in Sky plc and Tata Sky to its portfolio. Disney will also get majority control of the video streaming service Hulu, which is also partially owned by Comcast and Time Warner. Disney will assume $13.7bn in Fox debt as part of the stock deal, taking the total value of the transaction to more than $66bn. Disney already owns a vast array of news, film and leisure companies. But the media landscape is changing as technology companies like Amazon and Netflix attract customers to new ways of viewing. Disney is investing heavily in online streaming platforms, as a way to counter a downturn in its pay-TV business and threats from these new rivals. The firm believes this deal will give it the scale to compete, and expects to wring ""at least"" $2bn in cost-savings out of the new company to boot. David Yelland, former editor of the Murdoch owned Sun newspaper in the UK, told the BBC the transaction puts Disney in pole position to compete with California's tech giants. ""In ten years time there'll be two Chinese giants and four US giants and [of the current entertainment companies] the only one that'll survive will be Disney."" A 2011 interview on the FOX Business Network, part of what will remain at Fox Fox is creating a smaller firm focused on news and major live sports events in the US. It will hold onto its flagship Fox News Channel, Fox Business Network, Fox Broadcasting Company, Fox Sports, Fox Television Stations Group, and sports cable networks FS1, FS2, Fox Deportes and Big Ten Network. Lachlan Murdoch said: ""While the merged business is about scale, the new Fox is about returning to our roots as a lean, aggressive, challenger brand."" There has been speculation the deal opens the opportunity to reunite Fox with the news businesses which were spun-off in 2013 following a scandal over phone tapping in the UK. That prompted the creation of a separate news publishing group, News Corp., which owns the Times and the Sun newspapers and remains controlled by the Murdochs. Rupert Murdoch said the firm hasn't looked at that possibility and any move along those lines is ""way ahead"" in the future. As part of the deal Fox shareholders will receive Disney stock, representing about 25% of the enlarged company. In the UK, Fox is in the midst of a bid to buy the part of the broadcaster Sky that it doesn't already own. That bid is being investigated by the Competition and Markets Authority (CMA), which is due to publish provisional findings in January. The BBC understands that the Disney deal will not alter that CMA investigation. If the Sky purchase is approved, that deal would probably go through before the Disney purchase of Fox assets. So the whole of Sky would then be likely to transfer to Disney's ownership. If not, then just the 39% of Sky currently in Fox's stable passes to Disney. Rupert Murdoch said: ""If things go wrong, the existing [Sky] shares go to Disney. It will be up to them to decide what to do."" Either way Sky's future will lie primarily in Disney's hands. Most observers expected Rupert Murdoch to hand over his vast media empire to his two sons James and Lachlan. So the decision to break it up came as something of a surprise. The management of the new Fox company is still being discussed. But Rupert Murdoch told Sky he hopes his elder son, Lachlan, will become chief executive. James has been widely tipped to take on a senior role at Disney. On Thursday, Disney boss Bob Iger, who is staying in his role running Disney until the end of 2021, said James will be involved in the integration of the two firms. As for the future he said: ""He and I will continue to discuss whether there's a role for him here or not, but I look forward to talking to him about it."" Rupert Murdoch with sons Lachlan (l) and James (r) The companies said they expect to complete the transaction in 12 to 18 months. But it is not clear how the deal - which increases consolidation in the movie and sports media industries - will be received by US competition regulators. The US Department of Justice recently sued to block AT&T's $85.4bn deal to buy Time Warner, on the basis that it will raise prices for consumers and competitors. It is possible officials would take a similarly dim view of a Disney-Fox tie up, in which case Disney would pay Fox a $2.5bn break-up fee. The Writers Guild of America West, a union that represents writers for television and movies, said it opposes the deal on the grounds that it would increase Disney's already sizeable power. It said: ""The antitrust concerns raised by this deal are obvious and significant."" The Simpsons would become part of Disney's catalogue Five reasons for the Fox-Disney deal Would Rupert Murdoch break up his empire?

Scottish income tax changes unveiled,"Derek Mackay arrived in the Holyrood chamber alongside First Minister Nicola Sturgeon ahead of his budget speech The Scottish government has announced income tax changes that will see higher earners pay more than elsewhere in the UK - and lower earners pay less. The country's finance secretary, Derek Mackay, announced a new tax band of 21p for those earning more than Â£24,000. The higher rate of tax will be increased from 40p to 41p and the top rate from 45p to 46p. But a starter rate of 19p in the pound will also be introduced, Mr Mackay confirmed in his draft budget. Mr Mackay said the move to a five-band income tax system will mean no one earning less than Â£33,000 in Scotland will pay more tax than they do now. Scots budget: what does it mean for me? Mischievous Mackay's taxing budget Report: How was the budget unveiled? Scottish draft budget: At a glance Scottish economy facing 'subdued' growth And he told the Scottish Parliament that those earning above that figure would only pay a ""proportionate amount more"" than they currently do. His figures showed that 55% of Scottish taxpayers will pay less compared to south of the border under the new system - with 45% of people paying more. Someone in Scotland earning Â£150,000 will pay Â£1,774 more than if they lived elsewhere in the UK, with someone earning Â£40,000 paying Â£140 more. Accountancy body ICAS calculated that, of the 2.2 million basic rate taxpayers in Scotland, 1.4 million will be marginally better off than those in the rest of the UK whereas the remaining 800,000 will have a slightly increased tax bill. All 346,000 higher and 20,000 additional rate taxpayers will pay more. Mr Mackay also outlined how lifting the public-sector pay cap would allow for a 3% pay rise for public sector workers earning less than Â£30,000, and a 2% rise for those earning more than that - with a cap of Â£1,600 for those earning Â£80,000 or more. And he pledged a further Â£600m to provide superfast broadband to all premises in Scotland by 2021. The Scottish government was given powers over income tax rates and bands last year, with the new rates being paid by anyone who lives in Scotland. Mr Mackay had faced warnings from business leaders and the Scottish Conservatives ahead of his budget statement that Scotland could not afford to be associated with higher taxation than the rest of the UK. The finance secretary insisted the changes - which he said would raise an additional Â£164m - were necessary to ""mitigate UK budget cuts, protect our NHS and other public services, support our economy and tackle inequality in our society."" He said the tax reforms would make ""Scotland's income tax system even fairer and more progressive"". And he said a bigger increase in the top rate of tax for those earning more than Â£150,000 - which some opposition parties had called for - would actually reduce revenue as high earners would find ways to avoid paying it. Among the other measures in the budget were: Full relief from LBTT - the Scottish equivalent of stamp duty - on up to Â£175,000 for first time home buyers Funding to reduce the attainment gap in Scottish schools increased from Â£170m to Â£179m An increase in health funding of more than Â£400m - double the amount needed for NHS spending to keep pace with inflation Â£243m towards the expansion of free nursery education and childcare Local government resource budget will be protected in cash terms with the capital budget increased in real terms ""resulting in a total increase in local authority core funding of Â£94m"" Private schools will no longer be eligible for charitable relief from business rates, but universities and council arm's length bodies will be. Income tax. Public spending. Employment. Pay. The NHS. Schools. Indisputably, serious stuff. But there was more than a touch of mischief about Derek Mackay's demeanour as he got to the tax bits of his budget. Normally, he exudes gravitas, solemnity even. But he could not help playing to the gallery with a declaratory grin when he insisted that, for most people, Scotland would now be the lowest taxed part of the UK. Said gallery - led enthusiastically by Mr Mackay's predecessor, John Swinney - applauded loudly. The reason for this glee? Politically, the claim is a direct and precise retort to Conservative attacks that Scotland is taxed more highly. But, of course, when the dust dies down, the Tories will return to that attack. Read more from Brian Mr Mackay's budget statement was accompanied by the first economic estimates from the newScottish Fiscal Commission, which said the country is facing ""subdued"" growthover the next five years. The independent body predicted the Scottish economy will grow at less than 1% per year until 2022 - lower than that predicted by other economists. Its five-year forecast suggests GDP growth will be 0.7% in both 2017 and 2018, rising to 1.1% in 2022. It said the outlook was ""driven by slow productivity growth and exacerbated by demographic challenges"". Scottish Conservativefinance spokesman Murdo Fraser branded the creation of a new basic rate the ""Nat tax"". He accused the SNP of breaking a 2016 manifesto promise pledging not to increase the basic rate of income tax for those on low or middle incomes, and claimed the real reason was that Scottish economic growth is lagging behind the UK. Scottish Labourleader Richard Leonard said the Scottish government's tax and spending plans had ""tinkered round the edges"" instead of implementing radical change and delivering a genuine alternative to ""Tory austerity"". Scottish Greensco-convener Patrick Harvie said he was ""delighted that the argument for a more progressive tax structure appears to have won the day"", but said Mr Mackay should have gone further. AndScottish Liberal Democratleader Willie Rennie said the budget was a ""missed opportunity"" and ""does not do enough to meet the long term needs in the economy"". Elsewhere, theFederation of Small Businessessaid a majority of its members were against income tax rises, and that the Scottish government was steering the country into ""uncharted economic waters"". TheScottish Chambers of Commercewelcomed much of the budget as being positive for business, but repeated its concerns about ""Scotland's new status as the highest-taxed part of the UK."" And local government bodyCoslasaid councils would continue to face ""really difficult times"" in the future, despite the ""more measured approach"" by the Scottish government.

"NatWest security spat prompts changesThe bank told a security expert ""sorry you feel this way"" when a potential vulnerability was found.10h10 hours agoTechnology","The Natwest website shows as ""not secure"" in some web browsers NatWest bank has enhanced the security of its website, following a spat with security experts who spotted a vulnerability. Several researchers had asked why some banks used encrypted HTTPS connections for online banking, but not on their main customer-facing websites. When security expertTroy Hunt,externaltold NatWest its site ""needed fixing"", the bank replied ""sorry you feel this way"". But the bank told the BBC it would make changes within 48 hours. The changes were implemented on Thursday night. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a blog post, Mr Hunt suggested attackers could redirect visitors trying to access NatWest's online banking service, from the official address nwolb.com to something visually similar such as nuuolb.com. Shortly afterwards, NatWest registered the nuuolb.com web address. But Mr Hunt, who has previously testified before US Congress on matters of cyber-security, said the bank had missed the point. ""We're seeing 'Not secure' next to the address bar,"" he said. ""I would opine that 'Not secure' is not what you want to see on your bank."" A spokesman for RBS, which owns NatWest, told the BBC: ""We take the security of our services extremely seriously. While we do not currently enforce HTTPS on some of our websites, we are working towards upgrading this in the next 48 hours. ""Our online banking channel is secured with HTTPS."" Security researchers found several other major banks did not use HTTPS on their homepages. First Direct told the BBC: ""This functionality is something we're currently reviewing."" Lloyds Banking Group said the websites for Lloyds and Halifax did typically use HTTPS, but had also ""allowed HTTP access"" if people typed in the web address manually. ""We are in the final stages of correcting this,"" a spokesman told the BBC.  It implemented changes on Thursday evening. Tesco Bank has not responded to the BBC's request for comment. Online banking websites use HTTPS connections to help keep customer data private. When a website uses HTTPS (Hyper Text Transfer Protocol Secure), any information sent between your device and the website is encrypted, so it cannot be read if it is intercepted. However, security researchers found several banks did not use HTTPS on the rest of their websites, including the homepage on which visitors land. NatWest originally tweeted that it did not use HTTPS on its homepage because it only contained ""general information"". But the researchers suggested that without HTTPS an attacker could theoretically modify elements of a bank's website. They could send victims to a fake online banking site and steal their information. ""The homepage is insecure so you can't trust anything on it,"" said Mr Hunt. ""This is a banking website. No excuses,"" added Stephen Kellett, from security firm Software Verify. ""All pages, whether performing transactions, the homepage, the about page, the whole lot, they should all be secure. Why? Because they all launch the login page."" ""There are various ways this can be exploited, to lure the client on to a phishing website,"" said Dr Mark Manulis, from the Surrey Centre for Cyber-security. A phishing page is designed to look like a legitimate website to trick people into handing over personal information. ""It's possible to spoof the website and create a fake login button. Phishing attacks for a long time have been a major threat and can be quite sophisticated.  This makes such attacks easier.""

"Star system has record eight exoplanetsNasa finds a distant star circled by eight planets, equal to the complement in our own Solar System.8h8 hours agoScience & Environment","Artwork: the Kepler-90 system is the first to tie with our Solar System in number of planets Nasa has found a distant star circled by eight planets, equal to the complement in our own Solar System. It's the largest number of worlds ever discovered in a planetary system outside our own. The star known as Kepler-90, is just a bit hotter and larger than the Sun; astronomers already knew of seven planets around it. The newly discovered world is small enough to be rocky, according to scientists. ""This makes Kepler-90 the first star to host as many planets as our own Solar System,"" said Christopher Shallue, a software engineer at Google, which contributed to the discovery. Star's seven Earth-sized worlds set record Engineers from Google used a type of artificial intelligence called machine learning to find planets that were missed by previous searches. Kepler-90 and our Solar System compared Artwork: The Kepler telescope was launched to detect new worlds using the ""transit method"" The discovery was based on observations gathered by Nasa's Kepler Space Telescope. Its parent star is very distant, lying 2,545 light-years away. But its planetary system appears to be ordered in a similar way to our own. Andrew Vanderburg, a co-discoverer at the University of Texas at Austin, said: ""The Kepler-90 star system is like a mini version of our Solar System. You have small planets inside and big planets outside, but everything is scrunched in much closer."" To give a sense of how close, the outermost planet in the system orbits at around the same distance the Earth does from the Sun. Because the new world, dubbed Kepler-90i, is so much further in - it completes one circuit of its star every 14.4 days - it's estimated to have a scorching hot surface temperature of around 425C. The machine learning technique was also used to find a new Earth-sized planet, called Kepler 80g, around a different star. Some 3,500 exoplanets - worlds circling other stars - have been documented in recent decades.

Australia sexual abuse 'a national tragedy'A landmark inquiry makes more than 400 recommendations aimed at protecting children.6m7 minutes agoAustralia,"This video can not be played Abuse survivor Andrew Collins recounts his story A five-year inquiry into sexual abuse in Australia has released its final report, saying institutions had ""seriously failed"" to protect children. The royal commission, Australia's highest form of public inquiry, heard more than 8,000 testimonies from victims of abuse. The accusations covered churches, schools and sports clubs over decades. Among more than 400 recommendations, the report calls on the Catholic Church to overhaul its celibacy rules. ""Tens of thousands of children have been sexually abused in many Australian institutions. We will never know the true number,"" the report said. ""It is not a case of a few 'rotten apples'. Society's major institutions have seriously failed."" Since 2013, the royal commission has referred more than 2,500 allegations to authorities. The final report, released on Friday, added 189 recommendations to 220 that had already been made public. The proposals will now be considered by legislators. Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull said ""a national tragedy"" had been exposed. 'I can now pick up the pieces of my life': read what survivors have to say The Royal Commission into Institutional Responses to Child Sexual Abuse had the power to look at any private, public or non-government body involved with children. It was contacted by more than 15,000 people. More than 8,000 victims told their stories, many for the first time in private sessions. The commission also received more than 1,300 written accounts and held 57 public hearings across the nation. Allegations were raised against more than 4,000 institutions. Religious ministers and school teachers were the most commonly reported perpetrators, the report said. The greatest number were in Catholic institutions. Catholic Church 'abused 4,400 children' in Australia Anglican Church receives 1,115 abuse complaints Jehovah's Witness church 'hid 1,000 alleged abusers' The commission had previously recommended thatCatholic clerics should face criminal charges if they fail to report sexual abusedisclosed to them during confession. The final report on Friday urged Australian Catholic bishops to petition the Vatican to amend canon law to allow priests to report such disclosures. It also said the Catholic Church should consider making celibacy voluntary for priests because while it was ""not a direct cause of child sexual abuse"", it had ""contributed to the occurrence of child sexual abuse, especially when combined with other risk factors"". The BBC's Hywel Griffith in Sydney said applying mandatory reporting to confession would trigger debate across the Catholic world, and has raised questions for bodies far beyond Australia's borders. Read more: Acting on Australia's landmark abuse inquiry Among its other major findings, the inquiry recommended: A nationally implemented strategy to prevent child sex abuse A system of preventative training for children in schools and early childhood centres A national office for child safety, overseen by a government minister Making it mandatory for more occupations, such as religious ministers, early childhood workers and registered psychologists, to report abuse. Supporters of the inquiry gather in Canberra on Friday Throughout the inquiry, many leaders of institutions admitted failures and apologised to victims on behalf of their groups. On Friday, the president of the Australian Catholic Bishops Conference, Archbishop Denis Hart, offered an ""unconditional"" apology. ""This is a shameful past, in which a prevailing culture of secrecy and self-protection led to unnecessary suffering for many victims and their families,"" he said. However, he rejected changing the rules on confession. ""The seal of the confessional, or the relationship with God that's carried through the priest and with the person, is inviolable,"" he said. Spotlight on the secrecy of confession On the call for voluntary celibacy, he said it was up to the Vatican to decide. ""It's a discipline which the church can change,""he told Fairfax Media.,external But Sydney's Catholic Archbishop Antony Fisher told reporters that child sexual abuse was ""an issue for everyone, celibate or not"", saying the problem also occurred in families and institutions with non-celibate clergy. Australia's most senior Anglican figure, Melbourne Archbishop Dr Philip Freier, apologised for ""our failures and by the shameful way we sometimes actively worked against and discouraged those who came to us and reported abuse"". ""Gerry Ann"" said she ""lived in a climate of fear"" at the orphanage where she grew up. ""My time at [the orphanage] robbed me of my innocence, and set the benchmark of who I would become: frightened, petrified, scared, fearful, not worthy, introverted, isolated, segregated, sad and constantly suicidal."" ""Toby"" shared a cabin with four other boys at a primary school camp. During shower time he was sexually abused by two of the boys he was sharing his cabin with. He told his mother that the abuse had involved ""putting penises in his bottom"", and that he had told this to the deputy principal at camp. ""Brianna"" has spent her childhood in out-of-home care. She said at age five, she remembered being physically beaten. Her foster father, ""Sherman"", beat her with a pool cue as her sister hid under the table. He began sexually abusing her soon after she moved in. Brianna said that on at least one occasion, her foster mother encouraged Brianna's sister to sleep in Sherman's bed. Like many Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander survivors in out-of-home care, ""Raquel"" was subjected to harsh treatment by the foster family, describing them as ""cruel pigs"". She said she was whipped with a bamboo stick among other physical and emotional abuses. *Names have been changed in the report to protect the identities of the survivors.

Inside the 21st floorGrief still raw as service remembers victimsWorrying number of PTSD casesVideoVideo," Warning: This article contains content that some readers may find distressing The fire at Grenfell Tower in west London on 14 June killed scores of people and left the block a charred ruin. It stands as a reminder of one of the most tragic days in modern British history. Each floor of the tower tells a story - about London and its inhabitants, about immigration and gentrification, about lives lived and tragically lost. It was a microcosm of life in the capital. Like most of Grenfell, the 21st floor housed four two-bedroom flats and two one-bedroom flats arranged around a central hallway, with the lifts on one side and the staircase on the other. We used to play in the hallways because it was pretty big. We’d play football. And ‘it’. We had a nice little group on that floor” Marcio Gomes, former Grenfell Tower resident Marcio and Andreia Gomes, both 38, are originally from Portugal.  Marcio’s parents moved to the UK in search of a better life when he was five. He grew up in west London near Grenfell Tower.  Andreia arrived from Madeira when she was 21, looking for a change of scene. She had come on holiday to England every year with her family. The couple lived with their daughters, 12-year-old Luana and 10-year-old Megan. They’d moved into their council flat 10 years before, but still considered themselves “babies in the tower - a lot of friends had been there 20 years plus”. They loved life in the tower - the amazing views of London and the close-knit community. Marcio Gomes “It was great.  The rooms were big,” says Marcio. “There were kids on every floor, of all different ages. The corridor space in between the flats, even though it was very small, they would play tag, or ride their scooters or play football. We’ve seen a lot of those kids grow up and become young women and men, and move on and get a job.” He works in IT and Andreia is a supervisor in a clothes shop. Seven months pregnant at the time of the fire, she was about to go on maternity leave.  Their son was to be called Logan. They believe that, since the fire, Grenfell has too often been portrayed in a one-dimensional way, as a place full of poor people, living on benefits, but they point out the majority were working. Before the fire, Marcio had done some renovations in preparation for Logan’s arrival, transforming a recessed storage area into a snug nursery. His daughters shared a big bedroom and were making plans to welcome their new brother.  “They were very excited,” says Marcio. “The diversity was great, you’d meet all sorts of different people – Irish, English, Arabic, Muslim, Portuguese, Spanish, Italians. You’d get to see different cultures.  You’d go up in the lift with lots of different people, you’d talk, the kids would play. The tower itself was a community, it was very family orientated.  It’s been portrayed as a poor tower, a broken tower.  It was far from that.” On the night of the fire, the Gomes family had been out for dinner, but had been asleep for several hours when they were woken up by Helen Gebremeskel and her daughter Lulya, 12, who lived across the corridor in Flat 186. Helen and Lulya had already tried to get out of the building and had met the El Wahabis from flat 182 on the way. By the time they knocked on the Gomeses' door, it was between 01:30 and 02:00. “[Helen] was panicking a little bit.  I closed the door to stop the smoke.  It was already thick, black smoke,” says Marcio. These two families - the Gomes family of four with Helen, her daughter, Lulya, and two dogs - spent the next two terrifying hours waiting as smoke started to fill the flat. Marcio filled the bath with water and ran the shower.  With all the windows open, the two families stayed low to the ground to try to keep beneath the smoke. All of the adults had conversations with the emergency services and were told to stay put, that firefighters would come to rescue them. They had friends outside the tower who were watching the building burn and were calling them to say they must get out, including Miguel and Fatima Alves who lived on the 13th floor.  They’re also from Portugal and Miguel and Marcio play football together every week. Once the Alves family had escaped from the building, they began to call Marcio to tell him he must get his family out. Tension grew as the fire spread and people became trapped by dense smoke, especially those residents on the top floors of the tower. “I’m very religious and I kneeled down and I begged our lady of Fatima to protect them, to protect everybody in the building, but especially them because they are Portuguese and we knew them,"" says Fatima Alves. Helen was increasingly anxious. “At one point I think I asked one of my friends, ‘Can we speak to the fire people or the police you know?’ And she let me talk to them and we asked them, ‘What shall we do?’ And they say to us, ‘Someone is going to come and take you out,’” says Helen. “That's what they say to us from two to three o'clock. So we've been waiting and waiting and waiting. And then we call again and we asked them. And they said, ‘No, stay in, do not come out. Don't come out, don't come out.’” So the Gomes family and the Gebremeskels waited. At about 03:30, Marcio and Andreia’s bedroom caught fire. “My room is on fire.  Just like that.  My curtains are on fire.  My Moses basket is on fire.  All that side of the window is on fire,” says Marcio. “I looked at them and I said, ‘We have to go now.  There’s no turning back.  It’s now or never.’” Marcio tied wet tea towels around everyone's faces, wrapped wet sheets around them and gave specific instructions about the order in which they should leave.  They began the descent in the pitch black, gagging as they attempted to get down 21 floors of smoke-filled stairs. They found themselves treading on the dead and the dying - other Grenfell residents who, like them, had tried to get out of the building before passing out on the stairs. “We were just going, just going and going, because if we don’t keep going, we’re going to die,” says Helen. Helen, Andreia and Megan, who were at the front, managed to get out.  But when they turned around, Marcio, Luana and Lulya weren’t behind them.  The girls had been overcome by smoke at about the 10th floor and Marcio was desperately trying to find them in the darkness. ""I said, 'I’m here, follow my voice.’ I tried to climb up. She said, ‘I can’t, Dad.’ Then she didn’t talk any more. The smoke was so heavy you couldn’t see.  I kept trying to shout, ‘I’m waiting.’” Marcio saw a light. Two firefighters were on their way upstairs.  They rescued the girls and brought them down to safety. All three children and Andreia Gomes were put into induced comas and treated for cyanide poisoning.  Logan, the Gomeses’ son-to-be, was stillborn in hospital.  It has been difficult to cope with his death - and the deaths of other close friends and neighbours. Andreia Gomes “To me, it’s like yesterday.  Sleeping is horrible.  It’s good to talk about it.  We do that every day,” says Andreia. Marcio is angry that concerns about safety were ignored by the council and the tenants' management organisation before the fire. “Yes, it was an accident, but it could have been avoided.  The residents never wanted cladding, we wanted sprinklers.  We said to them many times it didn’t feel safe after the regeneration work they spent three years doing.  They kept saying, ‘Be quiet, it’s fine.’” But Marcio and Andreia are clear they don’t blame the firefighters for any of what happened. And they are intensely grateful to the two who picked their way through the darkness to rescue Luana and Lulya. The London Fire Brigade rescued 65 people during the fire. Due to ongoing investigations and the public inquiry, it says it cannot go into details of what happened on the night. Now the Gomes family home is just ash.  Detectives showed them a 360-degree view of the flat. “It’s pretty much all gone. The only thing that remained was the metal frames of the beds,” says Marcio.  “There’s a huge crack in the floor.  The fire must have been so intense in that area.  It was difficult for me and my wife to see, but it was important, to close that chapter in the book.” Both the dogs that the Gomeses and Gebremeskels tried to rescue died - after the girls passed out, both dogs ran back to their flats. As for the material possessions they have lost, though everything is gone, it’s the sentimental things “you can’t put a price on” that are missed. “The first thing I thought of was the nursery books my daughters had done, and pictures of course,” says Andreia. “I had photos of my mum who passed away.  The negatives were there, but we lost them as well.” Three months on from the fire, the family are still living in a hotel. They’ve only been shown one potential new flat in all that time and the strain is beginning to show. Marcio believes they can rebuild their lives. “We have to for the sake of the girls,” says Andreia. But they are haunted by what happened and by the fine line between death and survival. “I am not sleeping too well at the moment and that’s because all those things keep running through my head,” says Marcio. But his actions on the night were key to their escape.  He was calm and organised, filling the bath, wetting towels, giving clear instructions to the others about how they might make it out of the building.  Six of the seven people who escaped from the 21st floor that night did so under his guidance. Helen Gebremeskel Born in Ethiopia, Helen Gebremeskel, 45, came to the UK as a political asylum seeker when she was a child.  She moved into Grenfell Tower 20 years ago. For 17 years she lived in a one-bedroom council flat and then in 2014 she moved down a floor, to the two-bed council flat on the 21st floor she shared with her daughter Lulya – Flat 186. “It was a very special building, Grenfell Tower, very special,” says Helen. Lulya misses the flat. “Like when I walk through, I open the door and I hear my dog bark.  And then I miss my friends that I would play with.” Lulya: “I miss my friends” Helen’s flat was painstakingly decorated - a haven of white with a few splashes of purple in the form of cushions and carpet. She was proud of the home she’d created with its corner sofa in the living room, its large television and its designed feel. “It was very nice.  Whoever comes in that house is shocked.  It was a beautiful house.  The living room was very big.  And the kitchen, it’s very big.  I have never seen a council flat that big.” Off the entrance corridor, Helen had created a prayer room - a quiet place for someone with a hectic working life. Every day Helen went to the beauty salon she ran in west London. “I’m always working, I always go home late.  The only day I have a day off is Sunday which is to spend time with my daughter.” Helen was always close to her neighbours, the Gomes family. Lulya often spent time with their daughters. The night of the fire began like many other evenings for the family in Grenfell.  Lulya had a shower and watched a movie while Helen cooked their dinner.  They ate together and then went to bed.  But Helen was woken just before 01:30 by her fire alarm and immediately smelled smoke.  When she looked out of her kitchen window, she could see the fire. She woke Lulya, who grabbed their dog, and they tried to go down the staircase. That attempt failed but ultimately they were to be successful. Helen talks wistfully of the community she’s lost. “It’s my home. I know a lot of the people there, my neighbours, and everyone there.   When you live somewhere for 20 years, it’s your home. It’s very difficult for us.” As well as her neighbours on the 21st floor, her best friends in the tower were the Choucair family - Nadia Choucair, her husband Bassem and their three children, Mierna, 13, Fatima, 11, and Zainab who was three.  They lived on the 22nd floor and were her neighbours for 17 years. Helen spoke to them a lot on the night of the fire as they sheltered in their flat one floor up. “The last time I called them and I say to them, ‘You need to get out, you need to get out.  No-one’s coming to rescue us, you need to get out.’ I explained to them, ‘Just cover them with a wet towel, just wet it and just get out.’ I wouldn’t have done it if it wasn’t for Marcio. Her husband Bassem was crying.  He was crying and that was the last time I spoke to them.” Helen is devastated by their loss. “It’s very emotional, thinking you’ve got friends there who support you, is always there with you, you know. And then, all of a sudden, they’re not there.” Flat 182 was the home of NHS worker Abdulaziz El Wahabi, 52, and charity volunteer Faouzia El Wahabi, 42. They lived with their children Yasin, 20, Nur Huda, 15, and Mehdi, eight. Abdulaziz worked long hours as a hospital porter. He was dedicated, with a great sense of fun, says his brother-in-law Chris Jones. “You have to have a sense of humour to work in the NHS.  He never complained, he got on with the job.  Being a porter, you’re someone who goes to the operating theatre, to X-rays.  It’s a very important job - you just don’t get well paid for it.” Abdulaziz at work in University College Hospital Faouzia volunteered at the Westway Trust, teaching people to knit and crochet. She was also an involved parent at her youngest son’s school. “His mum always came on our visits. She’d accompany the class.  The children got to know her very well.  She had a wonderful smile.  She was a lovely lady,” says Sara Cooper, head teacher at the Oxford Gardens primary school. Originally from the harbour town of Larache in northern Morocco, Abdulaziz moved to the UK when he was nine.  His father, who was also a hospital porter, came on a visit to London and liked it so much, he stayed and got a job.  Soon after, he brought his family over to live with him.  His son, Abdulaziz, had two brothers and six sisters who all live in Britain. Abdulaziz and Faouzia had three children, all born in the UK. The family moved to Grenfell  shortly after the birth of their oldest son Yasin, 20 years ago. “That flat was their home.  It was like they took Morocco and it was in the flat,” says Chris Jones. Flat 182 was full of Moroccan artefacts including carpets and ceramics gathered on the family’s trips back to north Africa. There were Moroccan paintings on the walls and mirrors with Moroccan frames. There was even a miniature electrically operated water fountain with ceramic tiles. “Abdulaziz loved plants,” says sister Hanan Wahabi, who lived in another part of the tower. “He had a range of plants and he took pride in how much they would grow. “Abdulaziz and Faouzia were both proud of their children and liked having their photos displayed showing the progression of how they had grown.” The couple had just finished redecorating their bedroom. They changed the flooring from carpet to laminate wood and bought new cupboards and drawers from Ikea which the older two children helped to put together. The oldest child, Yasin, was studying accountancy part-time at Greenwich University.  He’d also completed a course as a referee at football tournaments, worked in Subway and helped one of his uncles on his stall in Portobello market selling Moroccan rugs. “Yasin was a grafter.  He had lots of friends.  Everybody loved Yasin,” says Chris. Yasin on holiday in Morocco Nur Huda, their only daughter, was described by her teachers at Holland Park School as a “warm and good-spirited 15-year-old”. She loved playing football. Nur Huda had finished some of her GCSEs just before the fire. Her aunt, Hanan, picked up the results when they came.  Nur Huda got an A in additional science and Bs in core science, history, PE, maths, English language and literature. “Her parents would have been proud of her,” says Hanan. Nur Huda was taking her GCSEs in June Eight-year-old Mehdi was in year three at Oxford Gardens Primary School.  A keen judo fan, his friends made a collage to describe him.  It included the words “funny”, “loving”, “warm”, “beautiful person”. Mehdi, dressed for World Book Day The El Wahabis, the Gomes family say, were at the heart of the 21st floor community.   The children were in and out of each other’s homes and the adults often knocked on each other’s doors for a chat or to borrow something when they’d run out.  Faouzia’s generosity stands out. “I remember one Christmas, she came to knock on our door, with this huge chicken.  She said, ‘This is for you, it’s Christmas,’” says Andreia Gomes. On the night of the fire, the El Wahabis ate together as a family.  It was Ramadan and Yasin went to the mosque to perform the specific prayer that follows the fast.  He then went out with some cousins and friends to an American diner in west London before returning home.  Abdulaziz and the rest of the family stayed and prayed in their flat.  Nur Huda was revising for her GCSE exams. Helen Gebremeskel and her daughter Lulya saw the El Wahabis at about 01:30 as they all tried to escape the building.  But as they attempted to go downstairs, they were turned back by other Grenfell residents who were coming up the staircase. “People were telling us to go back up.  Because the firefighters had told them to go back up, to go to the top,” says Lulya. Relatives of the El Wahabis spoke to them by phone that night. Abdulaziz’s sister Hanan lived with her family on the ninth floor.  She escaped from the building at about 01:20 and then spoke to her brother at 01:25.  He said he was going to try and get out with his family.  They spoke again at about 01:30 and Abdulaziz told her they hadn’t been able to get out because it was pitch black and they were struggling to breathe outside the flat. When Hanan called again, the family said they’d been told by the emergency services to stay put and await rescue.  Another sister spoke to Faouzia El Wahabi at about 02:00.  Faouzia told her that the emergency services had advised the family to move into the bedroom and put towels under the door. Chris Jones and his wife also spoke to Abdulaziz that night. “He said, ‘There’s a lot of smoke, we’re not leaving.’  After that, that was it.  We tried ringing and ringing, but there was no answer,” says Chris. “I’ve thought a few times about being put in the position where you’ve made a decision for the family around you.  The last thing you would do is what we call the Shahada [prayer]. They would have got comfort out of that.” The surviving relatives have endured a long wait to find the remains of their loved ones.  All five members of the family - Abdulaziz, Faouzia, Yasin, Nur Huda and Mehdi - have now been identified in the flat.  Relatives received the news about Nur Huda only in the middle of September. The tragedy of the family’s demise has rippled out into the community. Head teacher Sara Cooper had to break the news to Mehdi’s class. “It was incredibly hard.  There was lots of sobbing, but I think it was important because they were ready – they were at the point where they could cry, because of all the amazing work their teachers had done. We all cried together.” A week after the fire, University College Hospital paid tribute to its missing porter.  The chief executive, Marcel Levi, said: “Abdulaziz is an extremely dedicated and hugely popular member of staff.  He is a larger than life character who never fails to show kindness and compassion to patients and colleagues.” Chris Jones is still trying to deal with what has happened. “If there was a good way to die, it would be among people who loved you and cared for you and would do anything on this earth to be with you.” “I can’t believe we won’t see them any more,” says Andreia Gomes. “The youngest one used to come and knock on our door every Sunday to play with our youngest. She used to go there as well to have dinner with them.  We used to see them every day, if not one of the children then the mum or dad.  I think I’m still just expecting to bump into one of them in the road.” Only 14 flats in Grenfell Tower were not in council hands - two were owned by housing associations and 12 had private owners. One of those was on the 21st floor. Flat 185 had been bought from the council in 2000 under right- to-buy rules by its tenant, Nigerian-born Tunde Adoweru. He had moved out a few years before and begun to rent out his property. The listing on the rental website described “a fabulous, bright two-bedroom flat, with panoramic views of London landmarks - 77 square metres in size, includes a contemporary fully fitted kitchen and open plan living room, two double bedrooms with fitted wardrobes, limestone bathroom and separate toilet.” Management consultant Julian Ng, 30, and IT platforms engineer Lee Stewart, 29, both British-born, had moved in 11 days before the fire. Their rent was more than £400 a week.  But the flat’s spacious rooms, chrome kitchen and surround sound stereo system immediately attracted them. “When you stepped into the flat itself, it was beautiful, tasteful, modern and because it was on the 21st floor, it had amazing views,” says Julian. “How do you describe London?  It’s very diverse.  And that’s what we got from this place.  It was a very nice place to live in.” Lee also liked the building. “It’s been painted as a very, kind of, poverty-stricken building.  Maybe parts of it were.  But that’s not the impression we had when viewing it.” The couple had started to plan for dinner parties. “We had a huge glass dining table, loads of windows.  You could take advantage of the views from so high up,” says Lee. They had a lucky escape on the night of the fire.  It was Lee’s birthday.  Julian was away for work and had invited his partner to spend the night in his hotel. They heard about the fire when their landlord called them at about 03:00. They watched the blaze on TV, horrified by what was happening and wondering about their new neighbours. “My last morning in there, I was late for work, it was 8.55.  The lifts took a really long time to get down - they were stopping at most floors and kids were piling in, going to the school just outside.  There were so many families and children in there.  You have a hazy memory of who you’ve seen, knowing not all of them will be OK,” says Lee. Julian and Lee have had moments of overwhelming sadness. “There’s a huge sense of loss,” says Lee. “It was my first night away from the flat.  I should have been home.  If I had been, when would I have heard?  Would I have been able to get out?  Would I have got messages to my family?  I keep thinking about the ‘what ifs’.  We were very lucky.” The couple have lost all their possessions and, like the Gomes family, it’s the more personal belongings that matter. “I had a stupid plant I carried around for 10 years,” says Lee. “It had a name, it is really daft. I’m terrible at gardening and can’t keep anything alive.  But this plant lived for 10 years.  It’s just stuff like that that’s irreplaceable.” Julian lost old photos from university and childhood.  “One of the things Lee liked was a T-shirt I had.  That’s lost.  OK, I can replace it, but not that specific T-shirt. [Or] the cuddly toy you had for 10 years.” Ligaya Moore’s friend, Nenita Bungay In one of the one-bedroom flats lived Ligaya Moore, who came to Britain from the Philippines about 45 years ago. Her friend Nenita Bungay says Ligaya had always dreamed of living in the UK. She came to work as a nanny and later was a waitress, and had married a British man, James Moore.  He died of cancer a decade ago and Ligaya, by then retired, continued to live in their council flat.  She was a keen ballroom dancer back in the day. A photo of Ligaya's wedding “She was an active person, she loved to dance, even at her age.  That’s why she loved our church because she loved dancing,” says Pastor Emil from the Jesus is Lord Church. Ligaya was well known to her neighbours on the 21st floor. “She was always sweet after school, because sometimes I’d come home by myself.  I’d see her in the lift and she would always offer me a sweet,” says Lulya. “She was lovely, she always played with the kids.  She was 80, something like that I think, and she used to use the stairs for exercise!  It was amazing.  From the 21st floor to the ground is a lot of steps,” says Marcio Gomes. On the night of the fire, none of the surviving neighbours saw Ligaya at all. Nenita was the last person to see her. “We had a wonderful dinner that night.  She peeled avocado.  We had a wonderful salad.  I brought some porridge.  She brought chocolate.  She was so happy.” After the meal, they went their separate ways at about 22:30.  Nenita got a call that night from another friend to say Ligaya’s building was on fire. “I call her every minute, no answer,” says Nenita. Nenita Bungay hopes her friend died peacefully in her sleep “I am thinking she was in a deep sleep, maybe in a deep sleep and being suffocated with fire and smoke.” The police showed Nenita footage of Ligaya’s burnt- out flat. “The ceiling, the walls, everything is rubble… everything is collapsed. The bed is only coils, the fridge is only a skeleton.” Forensic teams have located human remains inside Ligaya’s flat.  They haven’t yet been identified as hers. Very sadly, on 14 June, rescue never came for Ligaya Moore, or the El Wahabis in flat 182. Their neighbours will never forget them. “We used to see them every day,” says Andreia Gomes. “I can’t believe I won’t see them any more.” The occupant of Flat 184, who escaped the fire, chose not to take part in this report. Apart from the permanent residents, there have been reports of a woman from the Philippines, illegally in Britain, who claimed to live on the 21st floor. On contacting her, she said she was homeless and had spent time between two flats in Grenfell Tower - sometimes staying on the 21st floor but not on the night of the fire. She chose not to take part in this report. Built with Shorthand"
Grief still raw as service remembers victimsWorrying number of PTSD casesVideoVideo,"This video can not be played Grenfell memorial: Key moments Six months on from the Grenfell Tower fire, the grief and anger of those affected is still visibly raw. Underneath the sadness there was dismay that many of the survivors attending the national memorial service at St Paul's Cathedral are still homeless. And while those who died in the fire were remembered, there was also comment on what has taken place since - and what more importantly still needs to be done. Grenfell victims remembered at St Paul's Key moments as the fire spread Priceless pictures that survived the blaze Families' 'hotel prison' Memorial service as it happened On a cold and crisp December morning, there was a noticeable silence around St Paul's as people stopped to reflect. The poignant lull continued as survivors, friends and families of those affected by the fire quietly began to make their way into the cathedral. This silence was only broken when the majestic bells of St Paul's tolled across the City of London at 10:30. At the same time a spontaneous ripple of applause broke out from the crowd as firefighters made their way up the cathedral steps. Many held white roses along with photographs of loved ones It was a sign of the gratitude for the efforts of the emergency services on the night of 14 June. The bells continued to chime for 30 minutes, a mark of respect to the 71 who died in Grenfell Tower. And it is clear why the survivors chose St Paul's, a cathedral where so many services of national significance have taken place over the years. One mourner, Damel Carayol, 55, who lost his 44-year-old cousin Mary Mandy in the fire, said the service was needed and the venue fitting. The service was held at St Paul's Cathedral, in central London ""It recognises the tragedy on a national level,"" he said. ""It's a step, but the biggest step will be accountability."" And while the service was being held it became apparent that the anger and uncertainty on display in the aftermath of the fire remained. There are currentlydozens of households still stuck in hotels. Outside St Paul's, Prof Chris Imafidon said he knows of 20 people who lost everything in the fire. ""It is a very sad day,"" he said. ""But the families want a service from the council, not a church service. ""This is just a big distraction from the fact that six months on many families are still homeless and will be spending Christmas in a hotel,"" he said. There was another moment of reflection after the service finished. Hundreds of relatives and survivors gathered on the steps of St Paul's, displaying single white roses and photographs of those who perished. Some survivors then went straight back to their hotels. But there was then a range of emotions on display as others moved on to St Paul's churchyard. Visibly upset, they hugged and consoled each other, while some continued to vent their anger and speak of feeling neglected.

Worrying number of PTSD casesVideoVideo,"A large proportion of the people living in buildings close to Grenfell Tower show signs of post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), six months after the tragedy, which killed 71 people, the NHS says. Caused by very stressful or distressing events, PTSD can lead to nightmares and flashbacks, with sufferers often feeling isolated, irritable and guilty. So far, about 1,000 people have been screened for symptoms, with the number of PTSD sufferers at the highest end of a range of expectations after comparing it to other recent tragedies such as terror attacks. Overall, the NHS believes that as many as 11,000 people - including survivors, witnesses and the bereaved - could be suffering from the psychological impact of the fire, which took many hours to be brought under control. It anticipates that thousands of these people will need therapy. What happened at Grenfell Tower? Who were the Grenfell victims? Grenfell fire: Police say 255 people survived the blaze A special team of more than 50 therapists and 20 outreach workers has been established, called the Grenfell Health and Wellbeing Service, in what the NHS says is its largest ever mental health response to a traumatic event. More than 500 people have already attended sessions with NHS therapists to treat symptoms of anxiety and PTSD. So far, 150 children have completed or are having continuing therapy. ""I'm not coping,"" one woman told an outreach worker. She lives in a flat in what is known as the walkways - right next to the burnt-out shell of Grenfell Tower, a potent and ever-present symbol of the fire. Her eyes filling with tears, she said she was having flashbacks and was struggling to sleep but had begun to get therapy, which was helping. ""I thought I would cope, but I can't because the tower is still there. It's a big reminder, which you can't forget."" Inside the 21st floor of Grenfell Tower Messages from the tower The outreach work involves teams of NHS staff going door to door, working outwards from Grenfell Tower. They ask each person how they are feeling and look for signs of trauma. If appropriate, they complete an on-the-spot PTSD questionnaire. They call it ""street-screening"", and so far staff have screened about 1,000 people living close to the tower. The rates of PTSD picked up by the screening range from 75% of those screened in the buildings nearest the tower to 40% in buildings a little further away. But rates vary considerably from building to building. The plan is to continue street-screening outwards from the tower until the PTSD rate drops. But there are dozens of high-rise buildings, some miles away from Grenfell Tower, that had a clear line of sight to the burning building, and whose residents may also have been affected. The teams have also screened survivors from Grenfell Tower, most of whom are still living in hotels. I joined two outreach workers as they spoke to one survivor. ""Feeling down, depressed, or helpless?"" ""I'm feeling down, not depressed, but down."" ""Is that every day, every other day, or for several days?"" ""It's every day, yes."" ""Feeling irritable, or angry?"" ""Yes."" ""Difficulty concentrating?"" ""Yes."" The man lived on the 13th floor, with his wife, son and daughter. The whole family survived. The other family members are getting counselling, but he felt he didn't need help. Six months on, he's now changed his mind. The family owned a leasehold flat in the tower, and he says the continuing process of seeking compensation from Kensington and Chelsea Council has made him feel increasingly anxious. ""I tried to prove to myself that I can manage without [counselling], but I think it's the right time now to ask for help. ""I've felt a bit sad, and I don't want to give up just because I'm not well. I have the feeling it's better to give up - that's the reason I'm going to accept some help."" You can listen to Andrew Bomford's reports forWorld at Oneprogramme on the BBC Radio 4 websitehereandhere. Kensington and Chelsea Council says it is doing all it can to ensure survivors and local residents have access to the mental health support they need. The outreach team is dealing with numerous logistical challenges, including incomplete lists of survivors living in temporary accommodation and frequently changing council key-workers who are meant to be the main point of contact with survivors. Grenfell Tower: 131 families are in hotels, MPs hear The team has even had to provide therapy to key-workers who have themselves become traumatised by their work. The Grenfell Health and Wellbeing Service is the first response of its kind It's all been an unusual challenge for the NHS. ""I think the outreach model is completely unique,"" said Emma Kennedy, from the Grenfell Health and Wellbeing Service. ""Seeking out people, bringing them in, and walking through the journey of therapy with them, hasn't been tried in any other service in terms of disaster response."" People who score highly enough under the street-screening tool for PTSD or anxiety are referred to therapists for counselling, often a course of cognitive behavioural therapy (CBT) or another talking therapy. Therapist Claire Gibson is treating a number of survivors. She said many had not been able to process their memories of what had happened on the night of the fire, because of the extreme stress they had been under as they had tried to escape the burning building. ""The memory evolves like a multi-sensory video which can be re-triggered at any time."" ""People might start to get clips of what they saw, what they heard - even smelt, tasted, felt - on that night coming back to them in the months and years afterwards, and that can be very distressing."" One Grenfell resident now experiences those feelings whenever he goes downstairs. ""They actually smell smoke, and have the same fear they felt that night."" Treating PTSD of this type involves a process known as reliving - having the patient talk through these experiences in minute detail in order to update the memory in a safe environment. I joined one patient, who asked to remain anonymous, during a CBT session. He witnessed the fire and lost three close family members in it. ""When doing therapy, you're basically writing down what you've got in your head, but you're also re-writing what you've got in your head in a way that you're able to deal with,"" he said. ""It most definitely put things into perspective for me, in terms of filtering the important thoughts and using them to move forward with my life."" Many people living in the area say the constant physical presence of the gutted shell of the tower itself triggers flashbacks. Alastair Bailey, a consultant clinical psychologist who runs the adult part of the service, says it's a very difficult reminder for people. ""There's been a lot of support in the local community, and that's a really helpful thing. ""But there's another thing which is not so helpful in terms of developing trauma, and that's called rumination, which is going over what's happened to you again and again. Both things have occurred."" The service expects to continue offering therapy for years to come, as PTSD can sometimes take years to develop. About Â£7m has been budgeted for the NHS health response this year, and up to Â£10m will be needed next year. The Grenfell Health and Wellbeing Service is a free and confidential NHS service for children and adults  affected by the Grenfell Tower fire. You can access the service at The Curve, 4 Bard Road, W10 6TP between 10:00 and 20:00 every day. You can also call 0800 0234 650 (lines open 24/7), email cnw-tr.spa@nhs.net or if you are deaf or have a hearing impairment, you can use the Next Generation Text Service on 18001 0800 0234 650.

Barrowman panto 'too smutty for kids',"The theatre said there was no intention to offend A mum has called for a ""lewd and offensive"" pantomime starring the Krankies, and former Doctor Who star John Barrowman, to be axed. Natalie Wood has made an official complaint about Dick Whittington at Manchester Opera House, saying it was ""too smutty"" for children. During the show, she said, Barrowman fondled co-star Janette Krankie's breasts, and also invited audience members to chant ""Alice loves Dick"". The venue said no offence was intended. Ms Wood, who attended the show with 10 family members - including six children aged three to 12 - told the BBC the show crossed the line from innuendo to ""raw"" vulgarity. Among the moments she took issue with was one where Wee Jimmy Krankie, played by Janette Krankie, poked her finger out of her trousers, emulating a penis. ""The main issue for us was the actual fondling of Jimmy Krankie's breasts and all the different cheap smutty jokes,"" she said. ""Normally we share the jokes from the show afterwards - these kind of jokes you would have to discourage the children from repeating and or acting out,"" she said. A local primary school teacher, who wants to remain anonymous, told the BBC she was also concerned about the play after seeing it with her class. ""I've seen a lot of pantos in my time but this was a step too far - all the staff agreed it was wholly inappropriate,"" she said. ""I felt really uncomfortable watching it with my class. ""They were all gasping and saying 'this is really rude'."" In her letter to the theatre, Ms Wood said her children had copied some of the jokes in the show. ""My children were repeating Alice loves Dick and sticking their fingers out of their trousers for a pretend penis throughout the evening. ""This is not acceptable and my children required far too much explaining about adult humour for a family show.""
