Going green could save world 'trillions' - study,"The cost of green energy like wind and solar has been falling for decades Switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy could save the world as much as $12tn (Â£10.2tn) by 2050, an Oxford University study says. The report,externalsaid it was wrong and pessimistic to claim that moving quickly towards cleaner energy sources was expensive. Gas prices have soared on mounting concerns over energy supplies. But the researchers say that going green now makes economic sense because of the falling cost of renewables. ""Even if you're a climate denier, you should be on board with what we're advocating,"" Prof Doyne Farmer from the Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School told BBC News. ""Our central conclusion is that we should go full speed ahead with the green energy transition because it's going to save us money,"" he said. Will new government stick to climate targets? PM will explore energy market reform to cut bills What is climate change? A really simple guide The report's findings are based on looking at historic price data for renewables and fossil fuels and then modelling how they're likely to change in the future. The data for fossil fuels goes from 2020 back more than 100 years and shows that after accounting for inflation, and market volatility, the price hasn't changed much. Renewables have only been around for a few decades, so there's less data. But in that time continual improvements in technology have meant the cost of solar and wind power have fallen rapidly, at a rate approaching 10% a year. The report's expectation that the price of renewables will continue to fall is based on ""probabilistic"" modelling, using data on how massive investment and economies of scale have made other similar technologies cheaper. ""Our latest research shows scaling-up key green technologies will continue to drive their costs down, and the faster we go, the more we will save,"" says Dr Rupert Way, the report's lead author from the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment. Wind and solar are already the cheapest option for new power projects, but questions remain over how to best store power and balance the grid when the changes in the weather leads to fall in renewable output. Back in 2019 Philip Hammond, then Chancellor of the Exchequerwrote to the prime minister,externalto say that the cost of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 in the UK would be more than Â£1tn. This report says the likely costs have been over-estimated and have deterred investment. It also sayspredictions by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,external(IPCC) that the cost of keeping global temperatures rises under 2 degrees would correspond to a loss of GDP by 2050 were too pessimistic. The transition to renewables was, it says, likely to turn out to be a ""net economic benefit"". The research,externalhas been published in the journal Joule and is a collaboration between the Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School, the Oxford Martin Programme on the Post-Carbon Transition, the Smith School of Enterprise & Environment at the University of Oxford, and SoDa Labs at Monash University.

China's Xi makes first foreign trip since pandemic,"It's the first time Xi Jinping, seen here arriving in the Kazakh capital, has left China since early 2020 China's leader Xi Jinping and Russia's Vladimir Putin will discuss the war in Ukraine and other ""international and regional topics"" at their meeting later this week, the Kremlin says. The two will meet in Uzbekistan at a summit that will show an ""alternative"" to the Western world, the Kremlin said. Mr Xi is making his first trip overseas since the start of the pandemic. He is seeking a historic third term whileMr Putin's relations with the West are at rock bottomover Ukraine. Mr Xi made his first stop in Kazakhstan on Wednesday, where he landed in the capital Nursultan for the first leg of his three-day trip. He then travelled to Uzbekistan to meet Mr Putin at the Shanghai Cooperation Organisation (SCO) Summit in Samarkand, which will run from 15-16 September. Mr Putin will also meet other leaders including those of India, Pakistan, Turkey and Iran - but his meeting with China's leader ""is of particular importance"", said Kremlin foreign policy spokesman Yuri Ushakov. He said the summit was taking place ""against the background of large-scale political changes"". China and Russia have long sought to position the SCO, founded in 2001 with four ex-Soviet Central Asian nations, as an alternative to Western multilateral groups. Mr Putin (left) and Mr Xi last met in person in Beijing in February The SCO meeting comes amid fresh clashes on the border between two of its members, Kyrgyzstan and Tajikistan. Reports say at least one border guard was killed and two injured - their nationalities are not known. Sporadic clashes between the two countries, over a water dispute and other issues, broke out last year. Mr Xi's visit comes amid afresh set of lockdownsin China, where his zero Covid policy is still in place. While the rest of the world has opened up, Beijing continues to shut down entire cities and provinces every time there is a rise in cases. Mr Xilast left China in January 2020 to visit Myanmar- just days before the first lockdown came into effect in Wuhan. He has remained in China since then, leaving the mainland only once - in July this year to visit Hong Kong. India-China ties under spotlight at SCO summit Russian oil is turning to new Asian markets Zero Covid holds danger for China's Xi Mr Putinis also making a rare foray abroad. His meeting with Turkish and Iranian leaders in Tehran in July was only his second foreign trip since Russian troops invaded Ukraine. This is the two leaders' second meeting this year - they last met at the Winter Olympics in Beijing in February. Following that meeting, the two leaders issued a joint statement saying the friendship between their countries had ""no limits"". Russia invaded Ukraine days later - an action China has neither condemned nor voiced support for. Beijing, in fact, has said both sides are to blame. China is not part of the international sanctions against Russia and trade between the two countries has continued to grow. Indian and Chinese imports of Russian oil have soared since the Ukraine invasion. China too has seen its relations with the West and especially the US sour in recent months following tensions over self-ruled Taiwan. China claims the island as part of its territory. Last month, Beijing staged a five-day military blockade around the island in response to US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's visit. China watchers say Mr Xi's decision to leave China after more than two years, despite significant domestic challenges - crippling lockdowns and a faltering economy - show his confidence in his leadership. Analysts expect him to be re-elected for an unprecedented third term at the upcoming Chinese Communist Party Congress in October. China's leader significantly reduced the risk that he would catch the coronavirus by not travelling internationally for more than two years (assuming, of course, that he has not already been infected and we don't know about it). Keeping Xi Jinping at home also served a propaganda purpose - it got the message out to Chinese people that they too should not travel abroad during this time of crisis. Now that Mr Xi has decided to start travelling again, does it mean the Party considers it safer for him to do so? Another question: if it wasn't safe a year ago, why is it safe now? Also, will images of Mr Xi in other countries lead to expectations that travel restrictions should be eased further to smooth the path for Chinese people to go overseas again? In China, the government doesn't feel the need to spell out its reasoning when making such decisions, so we never know exactly what the thinking is behind them. However, this trip will be seen in China as a small indication that the country may soon see a reduction in its ""zero Covid"" measures. I say ""may"" because, if the government has a plan to eventually bring an end to its strict coronavirus strategies, it's certainly not sharing it with the public. The SCO is a Eurasian political, economic and security organisation that was founded by China, Russia, Kazakhstan, Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan and Uzbekistan in 2001. Iran is currently looking to join the group. Members will discuss trade at the summit, with China being a major investor in the region through its Belt and Road projects. Beijing has long looked to open up new rail routes for its trade to Europe, while Central Asian countries are eager for more connections to China. Earlier this year, Kyrgyzstan announced it would begin construction in 2023 on a new line connecting it to China and Uzbekistan.

Twitter shareholders approve $44bn Musk deal,"Twitter's shareholders have voted to approve a deal with Elon Musk to buy the company for $44bn (Â£38bn). The decision was made in a short conference call with investors from the company's San Francisco headquarters. It means Twitter will now try to force Elon Musk to buy the company in the courts. The meeting followed explosive testimony from Twitter's former head of security Peiter Zatko in front of the US Senate. In April, Twitter agreed to sell the company to the world's richest person, Elon Musk. However, the deal soured after Mr Musk alleged he was misled by Twitter about the number of spam and bot accounts on the platform. He said he no longer wished to purchase the company in May, but Twitter argues that Mr Musk cannot back out of the deal. Twitter misleading the public, whistleblower says Twitter spent $33m in three months on Musk deal The social media platform says that fewer than 5% of its monetizable daily active users (those who are able to look at adverts) are bots. Mr Musk argues it could be many times higher. Twitter is currently valued at $32bn, considerably below the $44bn offer from Mr Musk. Today's vote could have spelled the end of Twitter's legal pursuit, but shareholders have now given the company the green light to pursue Mr Musk in court. The two are set to meet in front of a Delaware state court in October. During the hearing a judge will decide whether or not Mr Musk has to buy the company. Just before the shareholder decision, Twitter whistle-blower Pieter Zatko was in Washington testifying before the Senate Judiciary Committee about alleged security flaws. He told US lawmakers the firm was ""misleading the public""about how secure the platform is. The firm's former head of security went on to say that Twitter was ""a decade behind"" security standards. Twitter says Mr Zatko was fired from his job, and that the claims are inaccurate. Mr Zatko has previously supported Elon Musk's claim that the platform has more spam and fake accounts than it has admitted - though he didn't elaborate on this on Tuesday. Last week, a judge said that Mr Musk's lawyers would be allowed to use the Twitter whistle-blower'stestimony in court,external. It largely focussed on national security issues - and is not officially connected with Mr Musk's attempt to pull out of the deal to buy Twitter.

Clarence House staff told jobs are at risk,"The household of the former Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall - now King Charles III and Queen Consort - has ceased operations Some staff at Clarence House have been warned their jobs are at risk following King Charles III's accession to the throne. TheGuardian,externalsaid dozens of staff were told during the thanksgiving service for the Queen in Edinburgh on Monday. Clarence House said some redundancies were ""unavoidable"" because of the change in role for Charles and his wife Camilla, now Queen Consort. They were working to find alternative roles for employees, a spokesman said. The Guardian reported that private secretaries, the finance office, the communications team and household staff were among those who had been warned of redundancies, as the offices of King Charles III and the Queen Consort move to Buckingham Palace. The King's top aide, his principal private secretary Sir Clive Alderton, said in the letter to staff that the change in role for the former Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall meant Clarence House would be ""closed down"". He said the former Prince of Wales's personal interests and former activities would no longer be carried out. ""It is therefore expected that the need for the posts principally based at Clarence House whose work supports these areas, will no longer be needed."" Staff were left livid and shaken by the announcement, the newspaper said. King Charles III, the new monarch The Clarence House spokesman said: ""Following last week's accession, the operations of the household of the former Prince of Wales and Duchess of Cornwall have ceased and, as required by law, a consultation process has begun. ""Our staff have given long and loyal service and, while some redundancies will be unavoidable, we are working urgently to identify alternative roles for the greatest possible number of staff."" The Public and Commercial Services Union (PCS) condemned the decision to announce redundancies during the period of mourning as ""nothing short of heartless"". ""While some changes across the households were to be expected, as roles across the Royal Family change, the scale and speed at which this has been announced is callous in the extreme,"" said general secretary Mark Serwotka. ""Least of all because we do not know what staffing the incoming Prince of Wales and his family might need. Mr Serwotka said the union would ""continue to work with the Royal Households to ensure that those staff have full job security"". ""We remain committed to supporting those colleagues across the wider Royal Family's estates, whose futures are thrown into turmoil by this announcement at this already difficult time."" It is understood legal advice taken by the household required the information to be shared with staff at the earliest opportunity, despite efforts to delay until after the Queen's funeral. However, Grant Harrold, former butler to King Charles when he was the Prince of Wales, said the news would not have come as a shock to staff. He told the BBC: ""Trust me, it's not a shock for the household."" ""When I joined, I was fully aware that if the Queen passed I would be redundant because my boss is no longer the Prince of Wales."" Mr Harrold, who previously worked at Highgrove House, the King's family residence in Gloucestershire, added: ""The good thing is, I know they will do everything possible to make sure that people are put into positions where possible - and, as I said, there will be people that want to retire or want a change of career."" Clarence House, which stands alongside St James's Palace, was the official London residence of the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall. It has not yet been confirmed whether the King and Queen Consort will live at Buckingham Palace. The households of the Queen Mother and the Duke of Edinburgh were closed after their deaths. Any Clarence House staff being made redundant will be offered ""enhanced"" redundancy payments, it is understood. No staff will be affected for at least three months.

Where do I join the queue to see the Queen's coffin?,"There were huge queues along the banks of the River Thames, where people waited to pay their respects to the Queen. People were told not to set off to see the lying-in-state on Sunday, as the queue reached full capacity. Just after 22:40, the queue was closed to new entrants. At 06:30 BST on Monday the lying-in-state ended. Here's what else you need you to know about the queue. At its longest, the wait time was more than 24 hours. The queue's maximum length was 10 miles - with 6.9 miles from Westminster to Southwark, and a three-mile zigzag queue in Southwark Park. For updates, the government published alive queue tracker for people to follow on YouTube,external. YouTube: DCMS,external Twitter: DCMS,external Facebook: DCMS,external People were warned they would need to stand for many hours with little opportunity to sit down, as the queue is constantly moving. On Sunday morning, thegovernment tracker,externaladvised people not to set off to join the queue as the entry point might soon close. The queue finally closed late on Sunday evening. People in the queue received coloured wristbands so they could leave for a drink, or go to the toilet, and then return. Those in the queue were asked not to attempt to save a place for someone else, or leave personal items unattended, or put up tents. Watch live: The Queen's lying-in-state What is lying in state? As people passed through Albert Embankment they were directed across Lambeth Bridge, into Victoria Tower Gardens, towards Parliament. They went through airport-style security before entering Westminster Hall, inside the Palace of Westminster. There were more than 500 portable toilets at various points along the route. Local venues and museums - including the Southbank Centre, the National Theatre, BFI Southbank and Shakespeare's Globe - stayed open for extended hours and in some cases for 24 hours, for people to use their facilities. This video can not be played People have queued through the night for the chance to pay their respects to the Queen lying in state Anyone hoping to pay their respects had until 06:30 BST on Monday when the lying-in-state ended. But organisers warned the queue would be closed well before this so that people did not join the line and fail to reach Westminster Hall in time. The announcement was published on government social media accounts at 22:41 on Sunday. What's a state funeral? Will shops close? And other questions How can I pay my respects to the Queen? What next? A day-by-day guide from now to the funeral The accessible queue reached full capacity at 16:44 on Saturday and was permanently closed, according to the organisers. The Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said that all time slots for the accessible queue had been allocated and it was permanently shut. It also asked people not to attempt to join it.

Transport bosses confirmed extra train serviceswould be running. Transport for London said the Westminster area of London would be ""exceptionally busy"". People were asked to avoid driving into London if possible. Some roads were closed, especially around Westminster itself, which disrupted bus services. Travel providers said the best way to get around central London was by using London Underground and rail services, although there was the possibility of temporary Tube station closures at short notice, along with special queuing arrangements. Network Rail said that some London train stations, including King's Cross and London Victoria,would remain open for 24 hours,externalto provide shelter for mourners waiting to take the train home. It added that many toilets, shops and restaurants within the stations would also stay open during this time. Visitors were advised toplan ahead,external, check real-time travel information, and consider walking instead wherever possible. People were also asked to avoid Green Park Tube station unless they needed step-free access. There was no ticketing system. There were a number of rules about what you could take into Westminster Hall, and how visitors should behave - there was further informationon the Houses of Parliament website,external. People did not need to show formal identification to enter the hall, but airport-style security checks were in place. People were advised tocheck the weather conditions in advance, and dress accordingly. They were also advised to bring: food and drink - although these would need to be consumed or thrown away before reaching the security checks any essential medication or equipment a portable mobile phone charger There wasdetailed guidance about what cannot be brought into the hall,external, which included: flasks or non-clear bottles - only clear water bottles were allowed in flowers or other tribute items - flowers could be taken to the dedicated area in Green Park any sharp items including knives coolers, hampers, sleeping bags and other camping equipment non-foldable pushchairs banners, placards, flags, advertising or marketing messages Any prohibited items would be confiscated and not returned. Police could also conduct security checks along parts of the queue. Each person was only allowed to take in one small bag with a single opening or zip. There was a bag-drop facility with limited capacity. People were asked to respect the dignity of the event, and to remain silent while inside the Palace of Westminster and dress appropriately, Anyone wearing clothes with ""political or offensive slogans"" would not be allowed in. Mobile phones and other electrical devices had to be turned off or put on silent mode. Once inside Westminster Hall, the queue was divided to pass on either side of the catafalque, which is the raised platform where the closed coffin lies. Visitors were asked to keep moving forward at all times while in line, until they have exited into Parliament Square. Not inside. Filming, photography and the use of mobile phones or other devices was not allowed in the security search area or once inside the Palace of Westminster. There were eight first aid stations run by St John Ambulance along the route. They were at Southwark Park, Potters Fields Park, the Tate Modern, the Southbank Centre, Belvedere Road, Archbishop's Park, Lambeth Palace and Victoria Tower Gardens. And more than 1,000 volunteers, stewards and police officers were on hand to help anyone who needed it. Volunteers were from the Scouts, Girlguiding, Samaritans, the British Red Cross, First Aid Nursing Yeomanry and the Salvation Army. There were water stations along the route, and venues and museums will provide refreshments. A one-minute silence was held across the UK at 20:00 BST on Sunday 18 September, the night before the Queen's funeral. A two-minute silence will then be observed at the end of the Queen's funeral, at about 11:55 BST on Monday 19 September.

Princess Anne: The can-do will-do royal,"The Princess Royal, observing her late mother's coffin There is one great final duty that many children feel towards their parents: the duty to see them safely and peacefully to their last rest. Almost all who take on that emotional task do so out of the public glare. But it was always going to be different for Princess Anne amid an extraordinary moment of history. In the last few days, it's emerged that the late Queen wished that her only daughter, officially the Princess Royal, should take the primary role in escorting her coffin - an echo of the role she herself played for her father King George VI's final journey from Sandringham in 1952. Her wish reflects the princess's reputation for hard work and duty, and the practical burdens faced by King Charles in the first days of his reign. Within 24 hours of Elizabeth's death, the new king's life had become a whirlwind, requiring him to balance personal grief with his duties of state. His 72-year-old sister - younger by 21 months - was at Balmoral, preparing to escort the Queen's coffin from that private family space into the public realm. The first stage was to accompany the coffin on its six-hour journey to the Palace of Holyroodhouse. The long road from Balmoral: The Princess Royal's car following the hearse in Scotland The journey would have required a degree of stoicism. By the time she had performed a deep curtsey as the coffin was carried into the Edinburgh palace, the emotion was showing. On Monday, her duties continued. This time, she walked behind the pallbearers to St Giles' Cathedral. Later, at the lying-in-rest, the princess became the first female member of the Royal Family to take part in the traditional vigil. Princess Anne curtseys as her mother's coffin is brought to Edinburgh The symbolism and message of Anne, standing solemnly in her honorary Royal Navy ceremonial uniform, was clear. Here was a princess raised in the modern era: an equal to her brothers. On Tuesday evening she accompanied the coffin, on the farewell to Scotland, escorting it all the way to Buckingham Palace, where the full protocol and formalities of a state funeral would begin. Nobody should be surprised by the prominent role of Princess Anne. She is hardly someone to baulk at duty and service. Charles and Anne, less than two years between them, with their parents For years, she and Charles have been measured by watchers for the annual title of Most Hardworking Royal. In 2021 she undertook 387 official engagements - two more than the then-Prince of Wales - a number that had been growing for both of them in the later years of her mother's reign. She has completed almost 500 overseas visits - 49 to Germany alone - and is patron of a 300 charities. Her association with Save The Children dates back to 1970. Even during the pandemic she was at work, visiting and raising the profile of a mobile testing centre. As her public presence developed over the decades, it was clear she had inherited her late father's reputation for no-nonsense and, on occasion, blunt-speaking. That dogged refusal to play the role of a meek fairy tale princess stood her in good stead during a botched 1974 attempt to kidnap her. She recalled to TV chat show host Michael Parkinson her refusal to go with the kidnapper amid the shoot-out which had left her protection officer and two others wounded, ""We had a discussion about where - or where not - we were going to go,"" she recalled. ""I was scrupulously polite because I thought it would be silly to be too rude at that stage."" An official government report available at the National Archives reports that her actual words to the assailant had been: ""Not bloody likely."" Her formal title of Princess Royal is a customary honour dating from the 17th Century. Notwithstanding that tradition, its award in 1987 has long been considered a symbol of how her work was so valued within what her parents - and grandfather King George VI - called ""The Firm"". That hard work has long been balanced with an independence of spirit - often difficult to achieve as a working Royal. Competing in horse trials in 1976, the year she made the Olympic squad In 1971, the then-21-year-old took the gold medal at the European eventing championships - and she was named BBC Sports Personality Of The Year. Five years later she made the Team GB for the Montreal Olympics. ""I certainly saw it as a way of proving that you had something that was not dependent on your family,"" she later said. ""It was down to you to succeed or fail."" Clearly, she had that approach to life in mind when she passed her heavy goods vehicle test, allowing her to drive horse lorries without the help of a royal retinue. As competitive equine sports receded with age, other work that brought her personal satisfaction took over - including overseeing her Gloucestershire farm. When she guest-edited Country Life magazine for her 70th birthday, she critiqued what had gone wrong in some rural areas - calling for more to be done to provide housing for local people who are ""priced out of the market"". ""All of them could make the difference,""she wrote,external. When Charles, as Prince of Wales, spoke his mind, his interventions regularly raised constitutional eyebrows. For Anne-watchers it was more a mark of a practical solutions-focused woman who has spent her life wanting to get things done - so focused on getting things done that she raised her own children without royal titles, in the hope that they could have a relatively normal life. That can-do will-do attitude will continue to be seen in the days ahead - an attitude first seen in September 1969. Back then, just 18-years-old, she undertook her first official engagement for Queen Elizabeth, when she opened a double-decker bus training centre near Shrewsbury. The Birmingham Post reported she was a ""most modern Miss"", taking to the wheel of an Albion Viking bus and laughing that it was easier to handle than a Balmoral Land Rover. It was the first of thousands of duties on behalf of Queen Elizabeth. Her last duties for her late mother are now before her. The princess herself says it has been an ""honour and a privilege"" to accompany her mother on her final journeys. There is no doubt that a new chapter in her public life is about to begin as she counsels and supports the King - and carries on rolling up her sleeves and getting on with it.

Center Parcs U-turns on Queen's funeral closure plans,"Previous plans announced by Center Parcs drew criticism online Center Parcs has backtracked over a decision to ask guests to leave its sites on the day of the Queen's funeral. The holiday firm said it had made the decision ""as a mark of respect"" and to allow employees to ""be part of this historic moment"". But the move prompted complaints from angry holidaymakers online. It would have meant some guests would have had to leave part-way through their break and return afterwards. One holidaymaker the BBC spoke to described the previous plans as ""ridiculous"". Others took to Center Parcs' Facebook page to express their anger, with one saying the last-minute change showed no respect to guests. Center Parcs had said that guests would have to leave its five UK sites for 24 hours from 10:00 BST on Monday 19 September. The company has now changed its decision, saying that it will no longer require guests who are not due to depart on Monday to leave. Those due to arrive on Monday, however, will still not be able to check in until 10:00 BST Tuesday. In a statement on Tuesday evening, it said: ""The vast majority of our guests are either due to arrive or depart on Monday 19 September. ""We have however, reviewed our position regarding the very small number of guests who are not due to depart on Monday, and we will be allowing them to stay on our villages rather than having to leave and return on Tuesday."" The five locations of its holiday parks include: Elveden Forest, Suffolk; Longleat Forest, Wiltshire; Sherwood Forest, Nottinghamshire; Woburn Forest, Bedfordshire; and Whinfell Forest, Cumbria. Facilities on-site, including restaurants, will still remain closed on Monday too. Center Parcs said it would be offering a discount for the lack of facilities available on that day. Asda and Odeon cinemas among businesses closing for Queen's funeral David Tomlinson from Solihull, is two days into a two-week break with his wife at the Sherwood Forest site. He said the company had the opportunity to inform guests of the decision before they checked in on Monday. Guests also took to Center Parcs' Facebook page to vent their frustration before the update was made. ""You're closing your sites at very short notice as a mark of respect, while showing very little respect for your customers,"" one wrote. Another said: ""We were five related families getting together for our annual family holiday - with two small children and two dogs, three hours from home! ""Sorry, but this is an awful decision that has left us devastated."" They pleaded: ""By all means close the restaurants and activities, but let us stay on the park!"" Rival holiday company Butlin's has said that its resorts will be staying open on Monday, with some changes to arrival times. According togovernment guidance,external, businesses are under no obligation to close during the period of national mourning, which includes the Queen's funeral on Monday 19 September. However, a number of firmshave said they will close all or some of their storeson Monday, including supermarket chains Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda and retailers such as Primark and John Lewis.

Archie Battersbee's funeral held in home city,"Family and friends gathered at St Mary's Church in Prittlewell, Southend, for Archie's funeral Family and friends of Archie Battersbee, who died following a legal battle over his life support, have paid tribute to him at his funeral in Essex. The 12-year-old boy died in August after his parents, Hollie Dance and Paul Battersbee, lost a series of legal hearings around his medical treatment. Mourners at the service at St Mary's Church in Southend were asked to wear purple ribbons or ties to remember him. Ms Dance told the congregation ""he was the best little boy ever"". Speaking through tears, she said Archie had lived a ""fulfilled, happy life"" and was ""moulding into such a perfect young man"". The song Someone You Loved by Lewis Capaldi was played over speakers and there was poetry, hymns, a bible reading and a video montage of photographs and film of Archie. Hollie Dance told the service her son was ""the best little boy ever"" ""There was nothing run-of-the-mill about Archie,"" said Matt Badcock, head teacher at Earls Hall Primary School, which Archie attended. He also praised Archie's loyalty and ""strong friendships"". Another tribute came from Verity Adams of South Essex Gymnastics Club. She said Archie was a keen gymnast and scaled every piece of equipment and had ""no fear"". ""I've never seen that level of confidence in someone so young,"" she said. Archie's coffin was brought to the church by horse and carriage A gymnastics coach praised Archie's athleticism, saying he had ""no fear"" The colour purple became associated with Archie's Army - the name given to people who supported his parents' legal fight. Ahead of the service, his mother said the 12-year-old had wanted to be a world champion fighter and the funeral would honour that wish. ""He's still going out a champ,"" she said. Archie Battersbee suffered brain damage in an incident at home on 7 April and did not regain consciousness In April, Ms Dance found her son unconscious at home in Southend, Essex, and she believed he may have been taking part in an online challenge when he was injured. Archie suffered severe brain injuries and needed life-sustaining support, including mechanical ventilation and drug treatment. He never regained consciousness. How did Archie Battersbee's case end up in court? Archie Battersbee: Who decides when life support ends? Ms Dance and Archie's father had fought Barts NHS Health Trust, which runs the Royal London Hospital in east London where he was treated, about the care of their son. Doctors believed it was in his best interests for life support to be withdrawn - a decision supported by various courts over a number of months. Treatment was stopped in August. Following the service, a private burial took place and a memorial bench was unveiled in Southend's Priory Park, with a plaque that reads ""Make the most of your life, live and be happy"". Archie's family unveiled a memorial bench at Priory Park after the funeral Hollie Dance said the service would be a celebration of her son's life It was a moving service for Archie in Southend, punctuated with music, from his arrival to The Notorious BIG's Hypnotize to a gospel performance of Amazing Grace. The church was packed with people of all ages. But perhaps the greatest reminder of Archie's youth were the schoolboys who sat arm-in-arm comforting one another throughout the service. Archie's gymnastics coach Verity Adams spoke of how full of life he was, how he would scale the equipment in seconds and how, from her very first meeting with him, she knew he had something special. The 447 mourners wore black and purple in Archie's memory. There was laughter and nods of agreement when they were told Archie was happiest ""when upside down"". His tearful mum Hollie spoke briefly, telling those gathered that Archie would poke fun at her cooking, that he would tell people he knew his dinner was done when the ""fire alarm went off"". When her voice cracked, shouts of ""we love you Hollie"" and ""we're so proud of you"" came from the pews before the church erupted into applause. Archie's family went on from the church to a private burial, his glittery silver coffin placed in a horse-drawn carriage.

Google faces â¬25bn legal action in UK and the EU,"Google is facing two legal cases which could result in the tech giant paying out damages of up to â¬25bn (Â£19.5bn) over its digital advertising practices. The company is accused of anti-competitive conduct, and of abusing its dominant place in the ad tech market. Separate legal cases, in the UK and in the Netherlands, are being filed in the coming weeks on behalf of publishers seeking ""compensation"" from Google. Google has recently drawn scrutiny from anti-trust regulators after complaints. Ad tech powers the online adverts that people see on their smartphones or when using the web. Google is the largest, and most important, ad tech vendor - with a market share reaching over 90%. Selling digital advertising space has become a valuable source of income for publishers including global news websites, as well as smaller operators, such as independent bloggers - all of whom agree to carry advertising on their sites for a fee. The European Commission and its UK equivalent are investigating whether Google's dominance in the ad tech business gives it an unfair advantage over rivals and advertisers. The French competition watchdog imposed a â¬220m fine on the company last year. Johnny Ryan, from the Irish Council for Civil Liberties, told the BBC: ""Google is under pressure on two big issues - one is anti-trust and the other is data protection."" Mr Ryan said more cases were coming to light as competition enforcers around the world ""increasingly put demands on Google"". But he added ""the fines we have seen so far from competition authorities have had absolutely no consequence whatsoever"". Damien Geradin, of the Belgian law firm Geradin Partners - which is involved in the Dutch case - said, ""Publishers, including local and national news media, who play a vital role in our society, have long been harmed by Google's anti-competitive conduct. ""It is time that Google owns up to its responsibilities and pays back the damages it has caused to this important industry. ""That is why today we are announcing these actions across two jurisdictions to obtain compensation for EU and UK publishers."" The British claim, at the UK Competition Appeal Tribunal, will seek to recover compensation for owners of websites carrying banner advertising. If successful, this would mean a wide and diverse group could get compensation - from major media sites down to small and medium-sized businesses who produce their own online content. Businesses which do not wish to be included in the legal action can opt out. UK law firm Humphries Kerstetter is planning to bring its case with Geradin Partners to the Tribunal next month, although the process could take years to reach a conclusion. Toby Starr, of Humphries Kerstetter, told the BBC, it was important to bring the claim because of the reasonable expectation that the tech giant might change practices as a result. He said the claim represented ""victims of Google's anti-competitive conduct in ad tech who have collectively lost an estimated Â£7 billion"". ""This includes news websites up and down the country with large daily readerships, as well as the thousands of small business-owners who depend on advertising revenue - be it from their fishing website, food blog, football fanzine or other online content [which] they have spent time creating and publishing."" The UK competition watchdog is also investigating Google's power in the digital advertising technology market. The Dutch case is open to European publishers affected by Google's actions. Geradin Partners has teamed up with Dutch law firm Stek to bring the collective claim. Jan Bart van de Hel, from Stek, said: ""Many publishers have suffered damages as result of Google's wrongful actions. ""It is important to take action against this, not only to make sure that the damages of the publishers are fully compensated, but also to make sure that Google's anti-competitive conduct is prevented for the future."" UK litigation funder Harbour is funding both lawsuits. Harbour is a privately-owned company which  pays legal costs upfront ""and helps manage the costs and risks of litigation"" in return for a pre-agreed share of the amount recovered if the legal action is successful.

Queen's grandchildren greet coffin at palace,"This video can not be played Watch: The Queen's coffin arrives at Buckingham Palace The Queen's children and grandchildren greeted her coffin on its arrival at Buckingham Palace. The King was there with Royal Family members including his wife Camilla, the Queen Consort, Princes William and Harry and their wives, Catherine and Meghan. The hearse, accompanied by the Queen's daughter Princess Anne, travelled by road after a flight from Edinburgh. Despite the rain, crowds gathered along the route to pay their respects. There was applause from the thousands gathered outside as the hearse arrived at the palace. Shouts of ""hip, hip hooray"" were heard as the sombre mood gave way to respectful celebration of the late Queen. Many people lining the street put down their umbrellas as a sign of respect while phone cameras lit up the crowds as people documented the historic moment. The King and Queen Consort have since left Buckingham Palace after witnessing the arrival of the coffin. The procession to the palace marks one of the final stages of a solemn journey, which began on Sunday at the Queen's Balmoral estate where she diedaged 96 on Thursday. In a statement released on Tuesday evening, the Princess Royal, Princess Anne, said it had been an ""honour and a privilege"" to accompany the Queen on her final journeys, having travelled with her mother's coffin from Balmoral to London. ""Witnessing the love and respect shown by so many on these journeys has been both humbling and uplifting,"" she said. ""We will all share unique memories. I offer my thanks to each and every one who share our sense of loss. ""We may have been reminded how much of her presence and contribution to our national identity we took for granted."" Princess Anne said it had been an ""honour and a privilege"" to accompany her mother's coffin on its journey to London Thousands paid their respects as the Queen lay at rest in St Giles' Cathedral, in Edinburgh overnight, before her coffin was flown to RAF Northolt, in north-west London this evening. The national anthem was played as the RAF plane, which has previously been used to evacuate people from Afghanistan and deliver weapons to Ukraine, prepared to take off. The number of people outside the palace began to swell this afternoon - although it thinned slightly as the rain became heavier, with most of those gathered wearing raincoats and carrying umbrellas - creating a subdued atmosphere. But there were still several thousand waiting along the barriers outside Buckingham Palace. Among them was Londoner Alex Myers, and her dog Minnie, who decided to take a detour to the palace after hearing the Queen's coffin was on its way. She said the atmosphere when the hearse arrived was ""incredible and inspiring and very moving"". ""I think the outpouring of love has been a really amazing thing,"" she said, as both her and Minnie headed home slightly wetter than when they arrived, hours before. The Queen's coffin was in a bespoke new hearse designed in consultation with her, to allow the public a clear view of her casket. The Queen's coffin will rest in the Bow Room of the palace overnight before it is borne in procession on a gun carriage departing the palace for Westminster at exactly 14:22 BST on Wednesday. In the past, the Queen has hosted foreign royalty and dignitaries in the room, including King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, former US president George Bush, and Premier League footballers. It is in the palace's west wing, was formerly known as the Bow Library and was named after the window that runs along one side. The Queen made her last appearance at Buckingham Palace in June alongside three generations of her family On Wednesday, the Queen's coffin will be taken via The Mall, Horse Guards Parade, Whitehall and Parliament Square to Westminster Hall. Flights from Heathrow could face disruption to ensure silence over central London as the Queen's coffin is moved, the airport said. The coffin will lie in state in the hall until the morning of the funeral next Monday. More than 400,000 people are expected to be able to file past it there. From 17:00 BST on Wednesday, people will be able to pay their respects, althoughmourners have been warned to expect long queues. There will be some assistance for those unable to stand for a long time, Downing Street said, with the Prime Minister's official spokesman adding that ""everything possible"" would be done to facilitate those who could not wait for extended periods. Barriers for the queue were being placed as far out as Southwark Park, in south-east London, about three miles from Westminster, and about 50 people had already begun queuing to see the Queen lying in state by 20:30 BST on Tuesday. The Queen's final public appearance at Buckingham Palace was on the east front balcony on 5 June, where she stood alongside family members during Platinum Jubilee celebrations. Earlier, after standing vigil by his mother's coffin in Edinburgh on Monday, King Charlestravelled to Northern Irelandalongside Camilla, the Queen Consort, where he met politicians and officials. He said the Queen had ""never ceased to pray for the best of times for this place and its people"" and said she had felt deeply ""the significance of the role she herself played in bringing together those whom history had separated"". The King pledged to ""seek the welfare of all the inhabitants of Northern Ireland"". He received a message of condolence from the speaker of the assembly Alex Maskey, a member of Sinn FÃ©in, who said the Queen recognised how a ""small but significant gesture can make a huge difference in changing attitudes"". More than 26,000 mournersfiled past the Queen's coffin at St Giles', where she lay at rest before being taken to Edinburgh airport and flown to RAF Northolt, in West London. People queued for hours with the final wristbands granting access being given out at 13:00 BST, leaving some of those turned away in tears. What next?

Queen's grandchildren to receive coffin at palace,"This video can not be played Watch: The Queen's coffin arrives at Buckingham Palace The Queen's children and grandchildren greeted her coffin on its arrival at Buckingham Palace. The King was there with Royal Family members including his wife Camilla, the Queen Consort, Princes William and Harry and their wives, Catherine and Meghan. The hearse, accompanied by the Queen's daughter Princess Anne, travelled by road after a flight from Edinburgh. Despite the rain, crowds gathered along the route to pay their respects. There was applause from the thousands gathered outside as the hearse arrived at the palace. Shouts of ""hip, hip hooray"" were heard as the sombre mood gave way to respectful celebration of the late Queen. Many people lining the street put down their umbrellas as a sign of respect while phone cameras lit up the crowds as people documented the historic moment.

Fury as Center Parcs to close for Queen's funeral,"Previous plans announced by Center Parcs drew criticism online Center Parcs has backtracked over a decision to ask guests to leave its sites on the day of the Queen's funeral. The holiday firm said it had made the decision ""as a mark of respect"" and to allow employees to ""be part of this historic moment"". But the move prompted complaints from angry holidaymakers online. It would have meant some guests would have had to leave part-way through their break and return afterwards. One holidaymaker the BBC spoke to described the previous plans as ""ridiculous"". Others took to Center Parcs' Facebook page to express their anger, with one saying the last-minute change showed no respect to guests. Center Parcs had said that guests would have to leave its five UK sites for 24 hours from 10:00 BST on Monday 19 September. The company has now changed its decision, saying that it will no longer require guests who are not due to depart on Monday to leave. Those due to arrive on Monday, however, will still not be able to check in until 10:00 BST Tuesday. In a statement on Tuesday evening, it said: ""The vast majority of our guests are either due to arrive or depart on Monday 19 September. ""We have however, reviewed our position regarding the very small number of guests who are not due to depart on Monday, and we will be allowing them to stay on our villages rather than having to leave and return on Tuesday."" The five locations of its holiday parks include: Elveden Forest, Suffolk; Longleat Forest, Wiltshire; Sherwood Forest, Nottinghamshire; Woburn Forest, Bedfordshire; and Whinfell Forest, Cumbria. Facilities on-site, including restaurants, will still remain closed on Monday too. Center Parcs said it would be offering a discount for the lack of facilities available on that day. Asda and Odeon cinemas among businesses closing for Queen's funeral David Tomlinson from Solihull, is two days into a two-week break with his wife at the Sherwood Forest site. He said the company had the opportunity to inform guests of the decision before they checked in on Monday. Guests also took to Center Parcs' Facebook page to vent their frustration before the update was made. ""You're closing your sites at very short notice as a mark of respect, while showing very little respect for your customers,"" one wrote. Another said: ""We were five related families getting together for our annual family holiday - with two small children and two dogs, three hours from home! ""Sorry, but this is an awful decision that has left us devastated."" They pleaded: ""By all means close the restaurants and activities, but let us stay on the park!"" Rival holiday company Butlin's has said that its resorts will be staying open on Monday, with some changes to arrival times. According togovernment guidance,external, businesses are under no obligation to close during the period of national mourning, which includes the Queen's funeral on Monday 19 September. However, a number of firmshave said they will close all or some of their storeson Monday, including supermarket chains Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda and retailers such as Primark and John Lewis.

Aldi becomes Britainâs fourth-largest supermarket,"Aldi has overtaken Morrisons to become the fourth-largest UK supermarket for the first time, according to data from research firm Kantar. Discounters are grabbing more market share as shoppers take steps to manage their budgets, Kantar said. Food prices are rising quickly as energy and fuel costs soar, and the war in Ukraine squeezes grain production and pushes up fertiliser costs. Kantar said food price inflation hit a record 12.4% in August. Milk, butter and dog food prices were rising especially quickly. Inflation in the UK has been rising at its fastest rate for 40 years as food prices climb with living costs eating into household budgets. What is the UK inflation rate and why is the cost of living rising? UK inflation: Food costs push price rises to new 40-year high ""It seems there's no end in sight to grocery inflation as the rate at which food and drink prices are increasing continues to accelerate,""said Kantar head of retail and consumer insight Fraser McKevitt,external. ""Shoppers are taking steps to manage their budgets including broadening the range of stores they visit, with the discount grocers benefiting."" Shoppers are also cutting back on spending by buying more own-brand products, with sales of the very cheapest value own-label products up by a third compared to last year. Nevertheless, Kantar said food price rises will push up the average annual grocery bill by Â£571 to Â£5,181. Kantar said Aldi's sales rose by almost a fifth in the 12 weeks to 4 September compared with a year earlier, giving it a market share of 9.3%. Aldi UK and Ireland chief executive Giles Hurley said shoppers were ""voting with their feet by choosing Aldi over full price traditional supermarkets"". Meanwhile, Morrisons' sales dropped by 4.1% over the same period, with its market share falling to 9.1%. Morrisons said market share was ""partly a function of new store openings"". ""Although Morrisons has not put on any significant new space for a while, some competitors are still opening many new stores,"" it said. However, it added that ""customers don't really care about market share statistics - they care about value, quality, provenance and service and that is where our focus is going to remain."" This feels like a real moment in the supermarket aisles. Aldi and Lidl have been steadily stealing customers and growing market share driven by hundreds of new store openings. And they're still expanding, unlike their bigger rivals. With no grocery home delivery service, the discounters didn't have a great pandemic, but they're now clearly back on form. According to Kantar, the grocery market is worth around Â£131bn, and both chains together have now nabbed 16% of it. Aldi is adding more than a billion pounds of sales a year at this current rate of growth. They don't have it all their own way though. The price gap isn't as big as it used to be. Tesco and Sainsbury's are price matching Aldi on many key products. But in these challenging times, Aldi and Lidl are benefiting from cash-strapped shoppers trying to manage their budgets, and they are on the march again. 1 - Tesco (26.9% market share) 2 - Sainsbury's (14.6%) 3 - Asda (14.1%) 4 - Aldi  (9.3%) 5 - Morrisons (9.1%) 6 - Lidl (7.1%) 7 - Co-op (6.5%) 8 - Waitrose (4.7%) 9 - Iceland (2.4%) 10 - Ocado (1.7%) Source: Kantar Data relates to the 12 weeks to 4 September 2022 Mr McKevitt said: ""Back at the start of the 2010s, Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons together accounted for over three quarters of the sector but that traditional big four is no more. ""The discounters have seen dramatic sales increases in recent months, bringing more and more customers through their doors."" He said Aldi had consistently been opening stores, and that 14.2 million people had shopped at the grocer in the past three months. Aldi and Lidl have been expanding and growing their market share in the UK over the past decade. However, online grocer Ocado, which has also been growing, said it expected to see a small drop in sales this year as customers buy less and and look for cheaper items. Previously the company, which is a joint venture between Ocado Group and Marks & Spencer, had predicted a small increase in sales. In a trading update, Ocado said it expected earnings to be ""close to break-even"" this year as rising costs, including energy and dry ice, and the lower average value of people's shopping baskets offset a growth in the number of customers.

'Mourning but celebrating' during King's NI visit,"King Charles waved to members of the public outside St Anne's Cathedral ""We're mourning but also celebrating"" was how one fan of the Royal Family described the mood in Royal Hillsborough. The village hosted the new King Charles III and Camilla, the Queen Consort. The royal couple then travelled to Belfast where thousands of people lined the streets hoping to catch a glimpse of them. Hillsborough wasgiven the prefix ""Royal"" in 2021to recognise its long connection with the Royal Family. People began lining its streets at 05:00 BST, hoping to see the royal couple on their way to and from Hillsborough Castle, the official royal residence in Northern Ireland. Some people sensibly brought camp chairs, picnics and thermal flasks of hot drinks, anticipating a long wait before seeing the King. Mother and daughter, Valerie and Hayley Stokes, have attended a number of royal events ""It's difficult, he's been in training for this all his life,"" said Valerie Stokes, who was in Royal Hillsborough since early morning with her daughter, Hayley. ""He has been handling it with grace,"" added Hayley. How can I see King Charles III in Northern Ireland? Royal events are nothing new to Valerie and Hayley, from Ballynahinch, County Down. They have attended several royal weddings - Charles and Diana; Charles and Camilla; William and Kate - and can now add the King's maiden Northern Ireland visit to their list. ""It was very important to us,"" said Hayley, but Valerie added that the reason for the occasion was ""bittersweet"". Queen Elizabeth II, pictured at the Giant's Causeway in 2016, visited Northern Ireland many times during her reign While it was the 19th time the royal couple had visited Northern Ireland together, it was the first since Charles became King followingthe death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, on Thursday. Unusually, the monarch's visit was announced in advance: Details are often kept under wraps, due to security concerns. But crowds were accommodated outside Hillsborough Castle and in front of Belfast City Hall, where the King's cavalcade passed on Tuesday afternoon. The visit caused some congestion and traffic delays. In Northern Ireland, people's attitudes to the monarchy tend to be linked to their national identity. For unionists - who want Northern Ireland to remain in the United Kingdom - the sovereign is the personhood of Britishness, embodying the authority of the crown as a unifying force across the UK's four nations. Nationalists - who want Northern Ireland to become part of the Republic of Ireland - generally do not recognise the sovereignty of the crown here. Unionists feel the loss of the late Queen most profoundly - and welcomed the new King most enthusiastically. Nationalist sentiment is reflected in the main parties' words during the last few days - focusing on paying tribute to the late Queen's role in the peace process, and remaining detached from ceremonies to mark the King's accession. While Northern Ireland is known for its divisions, there was little anti-royal sentiment among the crowds, both outside Hillsborough Castle and Belfast City Hall. Union flags were being waved proudly by many royal supporters. Rita Martin, Gertie Lorimour and Jean Sands travelled from Mountvale Nursing Home with their carers For Rita Martin and her friends, the royal visit was a chance to be a part of history, though the death of the Queen was a sad backdrop to the King's first visit to Northern Ireland as monarch. ""We wouldn't have missed it,"" said Rita, who travelled with Gertie Lorimour, Jean Sands and their carers from Mountvale Nursing Home in Dromore, County Down, to see the King. They were in place, front and centre at the entrance of Hillsborough Castle, from 07:10. While Barbara Green, from Hillsborough, didn't have far to travel, that didn't stop her from getting up early: She was in position at 05:00. She brought with her a picture of when King Charles - who was Prince of Wales at the time - awarded her an MBE for services to special education five years ago. Barbara Green met King Charles, who was then a prince, in 2017 ""It just means everything to me to be here today,"" said the former school principal. ""The people of Northern Ireland feel for him, and wish him and the Queen Consort well. ""We want to give strength to carry on - he needs our support."" Gail Hutchinson and Sally McCambley (right) are regular visitors to Hillsborough Castle For 84-year-old Sally, the Queen had been a constant in her life and she fondly remembered the Queen's many visits to Northern Ireland and how, in the early days, she would come in an open-top car. ""She was greatly loved,"" she said. ""She never put a foot wrong, but Charles will be a tremendous King. He has seen her do it up close."" In the end, it was a swift departure for the King and Camilla, after their engagements in Hillsborough Castle, with the cavalcade travelling to Belfast for a strict schedule of events - but those who stayed gave a big cheer and the occasional chant of God Save the King. Hundreds gathered at Belfast City Hall with smartphones in hand, eager to catch a glimpse of King Charles III At Belfast City Hall, Eleanor Neill, who is originally from Glasgow but now lives in Belfast's Sandy Row, dressed up for the occasion. Eleanor Neill first saw the King in Scotland Ms Neill described the new King as ""an honourable man"". She first met him in Scotland about 30 years ago and said: ""He loves this, coming out and seeing the people."" Four nurses, originally from the Philippines, were in Belfast to show their support for the Royal Family. ""We've been here for five years - we feel like we share in your culture, she was our Queen,"" said Justine Gudes. ""It's very sad, especially for anyone from the United Kingdom. ""She was a global icon."" Marilyn Reyes, Raynel Amora, Justine Gudes and Nicole Felix set up near Belfast City Hall Healthcare workers Jacqueline Harrison and Jacqueline Kell were in a celebratory mood, having rushed straight from their jobs eager to welcome the new King. Ms Harrison said: ""It's sad for him, we'll never see the likes of this again, but it's celebratory as well -  I'll be having a few drinks tonight!"" Healthcare workers, Jacqueline Kell (left) and Jacqueline Harrison (right) were joined by Aaliyah Wasson (centre) as they welcomed the King Emma Ellingham had travelled from Cookstown in County Tyrone and said that attending was a display of her Britishness. ""I feel very sorry for [the King], people forget they're only human. We all deal with it, their grief is very public and they deal with it really well,"" she said. ""Today's crowds... It's a lovely touch to see the level of respect he deserves."" For those hoping for a brief handshake, some were left slightly disappointed as the royal couple briskly drove past to meet time constraints. With a deafening roar of applause, a few cheers and the sound of Amazing Grace being piped across Donegall Square West, the fleeting display lasted mere seconds. ""Although it's lovely, all the same,"" smiled one onlooker. Onlookers watched along as the Royals attended a service at St Anne's Cathedral The lawn in front of City Hall was busy with people viewing the big screen Hazelwood Integrated College pupils Jo and James, both 15, are history students The King and Queen Consort arrived to St Anne's Cathedral to tumultuous applause and cheers and shouts of ""God save the King"". As more and more dignitaries, including Irish President Michael D Higgins, Prime Minister Liz Truss and Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister), arrived at Writers' Square the anticipation in the crowd grew with loud chatter and a helicopter circling overhead. North Belfast history students Jo, from Cliftonville, and James, from Rathcoole, wanted to see history being made. ""I was a wee bit heartbroken when the Queen died - I'm not going to lie,"" said James. ""I had never really thought about the Queen as a force in my life until she died and then it felt like something was missing,"" added Jo, who said it meant things were changing. Members of the Army benevolent fund visited Writers' Square on Tuesday Gail Adamson, Brian Hyndman and Brian Adamson, all from the Army benevolent fund, were among those in Writers' Square. Gail said it seemed very surreal to say that the UK now has a King. ""It's a real privilege to be here today to meet him,"" she added. Lucy McConville from Bloomfield Collegiate was delighted to have shaken hands with King Charles III For some of the crowd at Writers' Square, a long wait paid off with a short audience with the King. Some of the children who met him had the day off school and had and managed to get a handshake with him. Lucy McConville, from Bloomfield Collegiate in east Belfast, said: ""I got to shake his hand - I was trying to budge my way up the big crowd and I just stuck my hand out and shook his hand - now I can say I've met a royal!""

"Going green could save world ""trillions"" - study","The cost of green energy like wind and solar has been falling for decades Switching from fossil fuels to renewable energy could save the world as much as $12tn (Â£10.2tn) by 2050, an Oxford University study says. The report,externalsaid it was wrong and pessimistic to claim that moving quickly towards cleaner energy sources was expensive. Gas prices have soared on mounting concerns over energy supplies. But the researchers say that going green now makes economic sense because of the falling cost of renewables. ""Even if you're a climate denier, you should be on board with what we're advocating,"" Prof Doyne Farmer from the Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School told BBC News. ""Our central conclusion is that we should go full speed ahead with the green energy transition because it's going to save us money,"" he said. Will new government stick to climate targets? PM will explore energy market reform to cut bills What is climate change? A really simple guide The report's findings are based on looking at historic price data for renewables and fossil fuels and then modelling how they're likely to change in the future. The data for fossil fuels goes from 2020 back more than 100 years and shows that after accounting for inflation, and market volatility, the price hasn't changed much. Renewables have only been around for a few decades, so there's less data. But in that time continual improvements in technology have meant the cost of solar and wind power have fallen rapidly, at a rate approaching 10% a year. The report's expectation that the price of renewables will continue to fall is based on ""probabilistic"" modelling, using data on how massive investment and economies of scale have made other similar technologies cheaper. ""Our latest research shows scaling-up key green technologies will continue to drive their costs down, and the faster we go, the more we will save,"" says Dr Rupert Way, the report's lead author from the Smith School of Enterprise and the Environment. Wind and solar are already the cheapest option for new power projects, but questions remain over how to best store power and balance the grid when the changes in the weather leads to fall in renewable output. Back in 2019 Philip Hammond, then Chancellor of the Exchequerwrote to the prime minister,externalto say that the cost of reaching net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050 in the UK would be more than Â£1tn. This report says the likely costs have been over-estimated and have deterred investment. It also sayspredictions by the Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change,external(IPCC) that the cost of keeping global temperatures rises under 2 degrees would correspond to a loss of GDP by 2050 were too pessimistic. The transition to renewables was, it says, likely to turn out to be a ""net economic benefit"". The research,externalhas been published in the journal Joule and is a collaboration between the Institute for New Economic Thinking at the Oxford Martin School, the Oxford Martin Programme on the Post-Carbon Transition, the Smith School of Enterprise & Environment at the University of Oxford, and SoDa Labs at Monash University.

Warning that post-lockdown jobs boom is ending,"The UK's jobs market, which has been buoyant since the economy began to recover from the pandemic, might be starting to turn, experts have warned. Although the unemployment rate fell to 3.6% in the three months to July - the lowest since 1974 - the employment rate and number of vacancies also fell. Rises in regular pay are also failing to keep up with rising living costs. ""The jobs boom that began six months after the pandemic is probably coming to an end now,"" said the boss of Reed. Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, James Reed, who chairs the recruitment business, said: ""There are still very large numbers of vacancies and people are still advertising a lot of jobs, and that's why we've seen unemployment continue to go down. ""The question is, what happens next? Will there be a jobs slump? That's a concern clearly but our data at the moment doesn't suggest that, because we've still got a large number of vacancies and a lot of employers are still struggling to recruit."" What is the UK inflation rate and why is it rising? Where the boss-worker power struggle goes next One reason for the fall in the unemployment rate is a rise in the number of people who are no longer looking for work, and so not counted in the figure. The inactivity rate rose to 21.7%,the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said,external, the highest since 2017. The squeeze on pay also remains, with rises in regular pay lagging behind inflation. When taking the rise in prices into account, the value of regular pay fell by 2.8%, the ONS said. Inflation - a measure of price rises - remains at a 40-year high of 10.1% and the latest figure, due out on Wednesday, is forecast to be higher. The continued gap between private and public sector pay growth was also visible from the ONS's figures. Average regular pay growth for the private sector was 6% in May to July, compared with 2% for the public sector. According to the ONS, that is the largest ever difference between private and public sector, outside of the height of the pandemic period. UK economy grew more slowly than expected in July Despite the jobless rate falling to its lowest rate for 48 years, other measures suggested that the jobs market might be beginning to turn. The number of job vacancies fell by the most in two years, down 34,000 between June and August, although the overall number of vacancies still remains historically high. The employment rate also slipped to 75.4%, a small drop from the previous three-month period. The EY Item Club said the fall in the unemployment rate masked some job market weakness. ""The decline in joblessness disguised what was only a modest 40,000 rise in employment, the smallest since January to March, with a rise in inactivity playing a bigger role in pushing unemployment down,"" said Martin Beck, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club. ""Moreover, the single-month data showed the number in work in July falling on three months earlier to the greatest extent since January 2021. This suggests that the weak economy is starting to have an adverse effect on the jobs market."" While the headline jobs numbers remain strong, with the unemployment rate at its lowest in nearly half a century and long-term joblessness down, there are some signs of a turn here. Firstly the lower unemployment rate is not really about a jobs boom, it is more reflective of fewer people actively looking for work. That in turn, in the very latest figures, arises out of record numbers of long-term sick. There could be an economic impact here from record NHS waiting lists. So the latest jobs numbers remain the silver lining on some dark economic clouds. Other elements here reflect the wider cost of living pressures. Real pay continues to fall sharply, especially for public sector workers. This is despite some high cash-terms pay growth. And despite a slowing economy, vacancies remain high. Labour shortages are in turn restraining businesses, and in particular could mean inflation remains higher for longer. There is one unemployed person per vacancy, a record low, and the jobs are not being filled. But if the government wants to ""go for growth"" that will have to change. Rob Sutton is facing challenges trying to recruit staff for his business. Rob Sutton is founder of RKW, the UK's largest manufacturer, distributor and designer of small domestic appliances. He employs 500 people in Stoke-on-Trent in the West Midlands and said his wage bill has gone up by more than Â£2.5m in the past two years. ""We are having to review our wage costs on a monthly basis because it is moving at that fast a speed,"" he said. ""It has been an absolute nightmare, where we are having to increase [wages] all the time so all our costs are going up and nothing is coming down at the moment. His business is expanding and trying to recruit more staff, but it has been a challenge. ""We've probably got around 20 vacancies that we cannot fill,"" he says. ""We've had examples where recruitment agencies have come onto our car park where our employees are parked and they put letters on the windscreens saying 'we will give you Â£1,000 to come and join the company' to entice them away because there has been a massive shortage of order picking and warehouse operators. ""That's mainly because a lot of the European workers have gone home pre-Covid."" Businesses have warned that the squeezed labour market is having a detrimental effect. ""With firms doing their best to keep afloat during a period of spiralling costs, they are also facing an extremely tight labour market which is further impacting their ability to invest and grow,"" said Jane Gratton from the British Chambers of Commerce. ""During a period of increasing inflation, and a stagnant economy, we cannot afford to let recruitment problems further dampen growth."" Tony Wilson, director at the Institute for Employment Studies, also warned that ""firms simply can't find the workers to fill their jobs"". ""This is holding back growth but also pushing up inflation, with pay growth in the private sector now running above 6% and contributing to even higher prices.""

The quiet symbolism of the Queen's farewell to Scotland,"King Charles has spoken about his mother's love of Scotland - saying she had ""found in the hills of this land, and the hearts of its people, a haven and a home"". Today she will leave that Scotland for the last time. In life, Queen Elizabeth came to embody that deep and abiding bond the King evoked on Monday in the chamber at Holyrood - the bond of a shared history and a common identity across the United Kingdom. Scotland today has, arguably, been diverging from the rest of the UK politically for 40 years. Support for independence remains below 50% - but not by much - and among the young it is much higher than that. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon wants an independent Scotland - but if that comes to pass, to retain the monarchy with King Charles and his heirs on the Scottish throne. As King, Charles will have to keep his views on that prospect to himself. But he begins a reign that will be very finely attuned to the sensibilities of Scotland and the distinctiveness of its traditions and institutions. That he has chosen to begin his reign with visits to Edinburgh, Belfast and Cardiff is telling. It suggests that the future of the Union is at the heart of his concerns. The early decades of his late mother's reign were characterised by the long slow contraction of British Imperial power overseas. He will be alert to the possibility that his own reign could come to be defined by the continuation of that process here, and the eventual dissolution of the United Kingdom itself. The Queen and Prince Philip But all that is for another day. On Monday, kilted soldiers of the Royal Regiment of Scotland formed a bearer party and carried the coffin of the Queen from the privacy of the Throne Room at Holyrood Palace. Her four children walked slowly up the steep incline of that ancient thoroughfare known as the Royal Mile, following their mother's hearse. The eyes of the world intrude on their private sorrow. They must subordinate their own grief to the imperatives of public ritual. It is the way they have lived their lives. The Queen's coffin was carried into St Giles Cathedral, the High Kirk of Edinburgh, where the Queen had sometimes worshipped, not as head of the Church here, but simply as a member. Here, they placed on the coffin the Crown of Scotland, made in the 16th Century for her ancestor James V. It is the centre-piece of the Scottish crown jewels - also known as the Honours of Scotland. Consider the quiet symbolism of this - it is a gesture toward the distinctive character of Scotland's historic nationhood. ""Here at St Giles,"" said the parish minister, the Reverend Calum MacLeod, ""John Knox confronted Mary Queen of Scots, King James VI argued about liturgy, Oliver Cromwell preached, and our late Queen received the Honours of Scotland,"" on her accession to the throne 70 years ago. The Scottish parliament she opened 23 years ago is the centre of public and political life here now. The King and Queen Consort were escorted into the chamber by the King's bodyguard in Scotland, the Royal Company of Archers. The MSPs stood for a two-minute silence. Each party leader spoke in support of a motion of condolence, beginning with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon. ""Our nation is in mourning for a Queen whose loss we have not yet begun to come to terms with,"" Ms Sturgeon told the chamber. ""We are deeply honoured by the presence today of His Majesty King Charles III and the Queen Consort. Your Majesty, we stand ready to support you as you continue your own life of service and as you build on the extraordinary legacy of your beloved mother, our Queen. Queen Elizabeth, Queen of Scots, we are grateful for her life. May she now rest in peace."" The King replied: ""My mother felt as I did the greatest admiration for the Scottish people,"" he said. ""For their magnificent achievements, and their indomitable spirit, and it was the greatest comfort to her to know in turn the true affection in which she was held. The knowledge of that deep and abiding bond must be, to us, as solid, as we mourn the end of a life of incomparable service."" The Queen's coffin will today be taken to London to lie in state at Westminster Great Hall. What will remain of that legacy, when this period of mourning is over and she recedes into the middle distance of our collective memory? That question will be at the heart of the new reign that began when she died. What next?

The monarchy's delicate Scottish balancing act,"Thousands of people watched the Queen's coffin on the Royal Mile in Edinburgh In the heart of Edinburgh this week we witnessed an ancient ritual in the modern age. As the Queen's cortege made its way up the Royal Mile from the Palace of Holyroodhouse to St Giles' Cathedral, the streets were a sea of smartphones. It was a vivid reminder that this nation changed beyond measure in the time of Elizabeth, a monarch whose affection for Scotland was, in her own words, deep and abiding. Descended from Stewart kings and Scottish aristocracy, Elizabeth's roots here ran deep. From childhood summers at her mother's ancestral home, Glamis Castle in Angus, to formal duties at the Palace of Holyroodhouse in Edinburgh, she spent a great deal of her long life in Scotland. The future Queen (right) at Glamis Castle in the early 1930s, with her mother and sister Margaret Staff on the Balmoral estate recall a woman with a love of horses, hunting and hurtling around in Land Rovers. Historian Prof Sir Tom Devine says the late monarch showed respect for Scotland as a nation and many Scots, in return, showed respect for the Crown. The long queues and lengthy waits to view the Queen's coffin in Edinburgh's St Giles' Cathedral, and the huge crowds her cortege drew in as it travelled from Balmoral Castle, underline that affection. Sir Tom says the late Queen's clear ""love of the land"" - a blood relationship running all the way back to the 14th century King Robert the Bruce - and her evident pride in being ""Queen of Scots as well as Queen of the UK"", helped to sustain support for Elizabeth in her lifetime. At times though there were complications. Within weeks of the coronation in 1953, the newly-enthroned monarch and her husband arrived in the Scottish capital where 30,000 people packed into Murrayfield stadium. Although the welcome was warm, her title - Elizabeth II - left some cold. She was in fact the first Elizabeth to rule Scotland. It was only on the death of Elizabeth I in 1603 that the crowns of Scotland and England had been united. King Charles, the Princess Royal, Prince Andrew and Prince Edward held a vigil at St Giles' Cathedral on Monday evening The Tudor queen was succeeded by the first Stuart monarch who was styled James I of England and James VI of Scotland. And so when the young princess became Elizabeth II on the death of her father there was slightly unusual trouble. Post-boxes in Scotland bearing the inscription EIIR were vandalised, even blown up, until the Royal Mail switched the design to a crown emblem instead. It was an early hint of constitutional tension which would resurface a quarter of a century later. The UK monarch is supposed to be politically neutral which made the Queen's 1977 silver jubilee address to MPs and peers in London's Westminster Hall controversial, even shocking to some. Hint of constitutional tension resurfaced during the Queen's silver jubilee The issue of the day was Labour's plan to devolve power to Scotland and Wales. Perceptively perhaps the Queen spoke of a growing ""awareness of historic national identities in these islands"", which she described as driving discussion about devolution. ""I number Kings and Queens of England and of Scotland, and Princes of Wales among my ancestors and so I can readily understand these aspirations..."" she explained. Then came the controversial caveat: ""...but I cannot forget that I was crowned Queen of the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Northern Ireland. Perhaps this jubilee is a time to remind ourselves of the benefits which union has conferred, at home and in our international dealings, on the inhabitants of all parts of this United Kingdom."" Sir Tom Devine says: ""I think it's almost certain that she must have been a unionist, emotionally."" He describes the Queen as probably ""the most significant and influential British monarch since the union of 1707"" when Scotland and England's parliaments were united to form Great Britain. Opinion polls often suggested that Elizabeth was more popular than the institution she led. King Charles III and the Queen Consort during a visit to the Scottish Parliament Now under King Charles III, argues Sir Tom, it is ""almost inevitable"" that Scotland's relationship with the monarchy will change. The new king, he says, ""will have the hardest of hard tasks to follow the Queen"". The polling expert and professor of politics at Strathclyde University, Sir John Curtice, says polling conducted before her death indicated a clear majority in England and Wales would choose retaining the monarchy over setting up a republic. In Scotland, however, while monarchy was still the preferred option of the two, support for it was below 50%. The institution could not be described as unpopular north of the border, says Sir John, but it is ""definitely less popular in Scotland"" than it is in England. That, combined with a feeling that the constitution may now be in flux, must surely be a concern for King Charles. Perhaps he will follow the example of his mother who demonstrated flexibility when faced with public support for political change. The Queen arrives to open the new Scottish Parliament in Edinburgh in 1999 By the end of the century the devolved Scottish Parliament which Labour had failed to secure in the late 1970s had become a reality and this time the monarch enthusiastically embraced it. As she inaugurated the new institution in 1999 she spoke with warmth and affection in praise of the national character of the Scots, a people with whom she made clear she strongly identified. By now it was obvious that the revival of separate national identities which the Queen had discerned in her realm two decades earlier was transforming politics. Within eight years of devolving powers over many domestic policy areas to the new parliament and executive in Edinburgh, the nation entered a period of Scottish National Party hegemony, Scottish Labour began to wander into the political wilderness, and a date was fixed for a referendum on independence - 18 September 2014. The monarch was hosting Tory prime minister David Cameron at Balmoral less than two weeks before the vote when a poll in the Sunday Times suggested Scotland was on the brink of seceding from England, Wales and Northern Ireland. It was apparently an awkward meal. The Queen with former prime minister David Cameron A week later, just days before polling stations opened to consider the question ""Should Scotland be an independent country?"", the Queen was reported to have told an onlooker at Crathie Kirk near Balmoral: ""Well, I hope people will think very carefully about the future."" The Palace denied the comment was political but those denials were later undermined by Mr Cameron in aBBC documentary when he recalled feeling a ""mounting sense of panic"" on seeing the poll. The former PM admitted that he then asked Buckingham Palace for ""just a raising of the eyebrow even...a quarter of an inch,"" because he and his team believed the Queen could ""make a difference"". If she did, the SNP leadership was careful not to blame her. In fact it was a mark of her relative popularity in Scotland, at least in comparison to the monarchy as an institution, that the party abandoned, or at least played down, republican tendencies. The SNP plan for an independent Scotland set out before the referendum involved retaining the British monarch as head of state. It still does. It's a position which appears to be aimed more at winning over supporters of other parties to the nationalist cause than keeping its own voters happy. A Lion Rampant and a Saltire are carried into St Giles' Cathedral in Edinburgh ahead of the thanksgiving service for Queen Elizabeth As Prof Ailsa Henderson, of Edinburgh University, points out support for the monarchy in Scotland varies depending on voting preferences. Among Conservatives support is in the high 70s in percentage terms, for Labour and Liberal Democrat voters it is in the 60s, and for SNP supporters it is ""much lower"" - in the high 20s. ""There's a distinction between what the party leadership has said and what supporters of independence actually want and there you find more tepid support for the monarchy,"" she explains. But even some republicans, such as the former deputy leader of the SNP, Jim Sillars, are comfortable with the party's position on the topic. Does Charles's accession to the throne affect the constitutional debate in Scotland? ""Not one bit,"" says Mr Sillars. Economic difficulties and political divergence with England are the key factors, he argues, adding ""no disrespect to the new King but he's irrelevant in the constitutional issue"". ""My advice to the independence movement is put that aside, that is not the most relevant matter that faces us at the present time,"" he adds. King Charles sits with First Minister Nicola Sturgeon during an audience at the Palace of Holyroodhouse But if the United Kingdom as we know it is to be preserved, argues Sir Tom Devine, who has previously expressed support for independence himself, then the sovereign does have a role to play. ""The monarch will obviously want to try to maintain what has been there for centuries,"" he argues. That may be harder after the death of the Queen, a moment which represents the unravelling of one thread which bound the nation together. In many ways Elizabeth embodied stability and national unity, both in her wartime service and survival of the Blitz, and in her link to a shared - and controversial - imperial enterprise which many Scots enthusiastically joined or supported. In the decade of her birth, her grandfather King George V still ruled over the widest empire the world had ever known, an empire on which it was said the sun never set. Nearly a century later she dies in a time of uncertainty about the UK's future relationship with Europe and the wider world and amid enormous economic and social turmoil. All around us there are reminders of the changes the nation underwent in the Elizabethan Age, and reminders too that as King Charles III ascends to the throne, it is changing still.

Queen's coffin vigil in Edinburgh comes to a close,"Thousands of people filed past the Queen's coffin in St Giles' Cathedral, Edinburgh The public viewing of the Queen's coffin in Edinburgh has ended. About 33,000 people filed through St Giles' Cathedral where Her Majesty lay at rest for 24 hours. Many of them had queued through the night for the opportunity to pay their last respects to the Queen. The coffin left the cathedral at about 16:20 on Tuesday and was taken by road to Edinburgh Airport, before being flown on a C-17 Globemaster to RAF Northolt, near London. It will go on to Buckingham Palace ahead of lying in state at Westminster Hall for four days. Crowds line streets for Queen's farewell to Scotland St Giles' vigil: 'She asked if the Queen was with mummy in heaven' What next? A day-by-day guide from now to the funeral The Scottish government said ""people across the country"" had paid their respects, attended remembrance events and reflected ""on a life of service"". ""This has been a very special part of history for Scotland,"" a statement added. Mourners started filing into the cathedral on Monday evening to be part of the historic moment. Thousands waited through the night, joining the line at The Meadows, which is south of the cathedral where the coffin lay. A steady stream of people joined the queue at The Meadows on Tuesday Those wanting to attend the vigil were required to pick up wristbands at the start of the queue, more than a mile away from the church. The last of those were handed out at 13:00 and the doors to the cathedral were closed to the public just before 15:00. It is understand that everyone who had picked up an official wristband managed to file past the coffin. Officials had earlier warned that the wristband did not guarantee entry. Charlie, 68, and his mother Janet, 89, were the last two people allowed to join the queue in Edinburgh's Meadows. Huge crowds gathered outside St Giles' Cathedral as the Queen's coffin began its journey to Edinburgh Airport Having travelled from Cathcart in Glasgow, Charlie - pushing his mother in a wheelchair - said he was ""very honoured"" to be in the city for this ""very sombre occasion"". It was important for his mother Janet to see the Queen's coffin, he added. She married in 1952 and the first television set she bought was to watch the late monarch's coronation the following year. The final opportunity for people to pay their respects to Her Majesty in Scotland came along the route her cortege travelled to Edinburgh Airport. There is also still a floral tribute at the Palace of Holyroodhouse. Heavy traffic congestion and disruption was expected in the city after a series of road closures along the route to the airport.

"Warning that post-lockdown jobs boom is endingThe jobless rate falls to its lowest since 1974, but the employment rate and number of vacancies also drop.","The UK's jobs market, which has been buoyant since the economy began to recover from the pandemic, might be starting to turn, experts have warned. Although the unemployment rate fell to 3.6% in the three months to July - the lowest since 1974 - the employment rate and number of vacancies also fell. Rises in regular pay are also failing to keep up with rising living costs. ""The jobs boom that began six months after the pandemic is probably coming to an end now,"" said the boss of Reed. Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, James Reed, who chairs the recruitment business, said: ""There are still very large numbers of vacancies and people are still advertising a lot of jobs, and that's why we've seen unemployment continue to go down. ""The question is, what happens next? Will there be a jobs slump? That's a concern clearly but our data at the moment doesn't suggest that, because we've still got a large number of vacancies and a lot of employers are still struggling to recruit."" What is the UK inflation rate and why is it rising? Where the boss-worker power struggle goes next One reason for the fall in the unemployment rate is a rise in the number of people who are no longer looking for work, and so not counted in the figure. The inactivity rate rose to 21.7%,the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said,external, the highest since 2017. The squeeze on pay also remains, with rises in regular pay lagging behind inflation. When taking the rise in prices into account, the value of regular pay fell by 2.8%, the ONS said. Inflation - a measure of price rises - remains at a 40-year high of 10.1% and the latest figure, due out on Wednesday, is forecast to be higher. The continued gap between private and public sector pay growth was also visible from the ONS's figures. Average regular pay growth for the private sector was 6% in May to July, compared with 2% for the public sector. According to the ONS, that is the largest ever difference between private and public sector, outside of the height of the pandemic period. UK economy grew more slowly than expected in July Despite the jobless rate falling to its lowest rate for 48 years, other measures suggested that the jobs market might be beginning to turn. The number of job vacancies fell by the most in two years, down 34,000 between June and August, although the overall number of vacancies still remains historically high. The employment rate also slipped to 75.4%, a small drop from the previous three-month period. The EY Item Club said the fall in the unemployment rate masked some job market weakness. ""The decline in joblessness disguised what was only a modest 40,000 rise in employment, the smallest since January to March, with a rise in inactivity playing a bigger role in pushing unemployment down,"" said Martin Beck, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club. ""Moreover, the single-month data showed the number in work in July falling on three months earlier to the greatest extent since January 2021. This suggests that the weak economy is starting to have an adverse effect on the jobs market."" While the headline jobs numbers remain strong, with the unemployment rate at its lowest in nearly half a century and long-term joblessness down, there are some signs of a turn here. Firstly the lower unemployment rate is not really about a jobs boom, it is more reflective of fewer people actively looking for work. That in turn, in the very latest figures, arises out of record numbers of long-term sick. There could be an economic impact here from record NHS waiting lists. So the latest jobs numbers remain the silver lining on some dark economic clouds. Other elements here reflect the wider cost of living pressures. Real pay continues to fall sharply, especially for public sector workers. This is despite some high cash-terms pay growth. And despite a slowing economy, vacancies remain high. Labour shortages are in turn restraining businesses, and in particular could mean inflation remains higher for longer. There is one unemployed person per vacancy, a record low, and the jobs are not being filled. But if the government wants to ""go for growth"" that will have to change. Rob Sutton is facing challenges trying to recruit staff for his business. Rob Sutton is founder of RKW, the UK's largest manufacturer, distributor and designer of small domestic appliances. He employs 500 people in Stoke-on-Trent in the West Midlands and said his wage bill has gone up by more than Â£2.5m in the past two years. ""We are having to review our wage costs on a monthly basis because it is moving at that fast a speed,"" he said. ""It has been an absolute nightmare, where we are having to increase [wages] all the time so all our costs are going up and nothing is coming down at the moment. His business is expanding and trying to recruit more staff, but it has been a challenge. ""We've probably got around 20 vacancies that we cannot fill,"" he says. ""We've had examples where recruitment agencies have come onto our car park where our employees are parked and they put letters on the windscreens saying 'we will give you Â£1,000 to come and join the company' to entice them away because there has been a massive shortage of order picking and warehouse operators. ""That's mainly because a lot of the European workers have gone home pre-Covid."" Businesses have warned that the squeezed labour market is having a detrimental effect. ""With firms doing their best to keep afloat during a period of spiralling costs, they are also facing an extremely tight labour market which is further impacting their ability to invest and grow,"" said Jane Gratton from the British Chambers of Commerce. ""During a period of increasing inflation, and a stagnant economy, we cannot afford to let recruitment problems further dampen growth."" Tony Wilson, director at the Institute for Employment Studies, also warned that ""firms simply can't find the workers to fill their jobs"". ""This is holding back growth but also pushing up inflation, with pay growth in the private sector now running above 6% and contributing to even higher prices.""

A successful surprise - but danger looms,"The Ukrainian military has released these pictures of seemingly-abandoned Russian vehicles in a river Ukraine says it has made significant gains in pushing back Russian troops, retaking more than 3,000 sq km (1,158 sq miles) of territory in recent days. Jonathan Beale, the BBC's defence correspondent, takes a closer look at why they have been so successful - and what hurdles Ukraine's forces may still face in winning the war. ""Don't underestimate the Ukrainian's ability to surprise,"" a senior US military officer told me early this summer, just as Russia was continuing to make  advances in the Donbas. Ukraine's ability to surprise has become a hallmark of this war: from the Russian retreat from Kyiv, to recent attacks in Crimea. Now there's another surprise happening in the east of the country. Until now, it was Russia making most of the advances here - albeit a slow and grinding affair that was proving costly to its army. Now it's Ukraine making the gains,taking back thousands of square miles of territory in just a matter of days. The biggest gains for Ukraine have been in the east around the city of Kharkiv. The UK's latest defence intelligence report says that Ukraine has now liberated an area twice the size of Greater London - though it's difficult to establish the level of advances and continuing fighting with journalists kept well away from the frontline. Ukraine says it has captured the strategically important cities of Izyum and Kupiansk - military hubs used by Russia to resupply its forces in the Donbas. Those losses alone would be a major blow to the Russian army. Surprise has been the key to Ukraine's advances. That and the intelligent use of western weapons - including US and UK long-range multiple rocket launchers, used to destroy Russian supply lines, ammunition dumps and command posts. Last week, the US Secretary of Defence Lloyd Austin said long range artillery had hit more than 400 key targets over the summer period. Before the arrival of these weapons, Russia had always had a numeric advantage in terms of artillery. But now, the tables appear to have turned: US intelligence officials claim Russia is having to seek the help of North Korea to resupply them with millions of artillery shells, suggesting their stocks have been seriously depleted in the six months of fighting. That impact of those western weapons - combined with Ukraine's determination to take back territory - has forced Russian forces and their proxies into what looks like a chaotic retreat. Images on social media show tanks, armoured vehicles, weapons and ammunition left behind in a rush and abandoned. Shock and joy in Ukraine's liberated villages Why Russia wants to seize Ukraine's eastern Donbas Interestingly, the advance in the east has been much faster than the Ukrainians' well-publicised offensive in the south towards the city of Kherson. Ukraine had telegraphed that offensive long before it got under way, while keeping quiet about its plans for the east. It all now appears to have been part of its plan: if not a diversion, then a screen to hide what it was preparing in the east. It's clear it successfully wrong-footed Russia. Over the past few months, Russia's been redeploying forces from the east to bolster its defences in the south. Both fronts are now vulnerable. But Ukraine is finding it harder to make gains in the south where they're more exposed, having to fight in mostly open countryside. An advancing army needs more troops and firepower to overcome a defending army. Russian troops have left behind equipment in their rush to pull back from the frontlines The danger for Ukraine may now be similar to the one Russia faced in the early stages of the war. Trying to advance on multiple fronts can prove costly - in terms of ammunition, equipment, and troops.  The bigger the gains the longer the supply lines - which can then be targeted by a defender. There's also the risk that those forces that have advanced furthest - creating a bulge in the defensive line - could become surrounded. Despite the optimism, Ukrainian Defence Minister Oleksii Reznikov has warned that Ukraine's forces in the east could now be more vulnerable to a Russian counter-attack. Seizing territory is not enough. An army has to hold the ground too. That might prove easier if the local population are behind you. Ukraine's double-pronged offensive is still risky. It could easily suffer setbacks. But this is much more than simply seizing back land - even if that is the ultimate goal. Ukraine is sending a signal to the world that it really believes it can win this war. It's already using these gains to appeal for more western weapons. And the offensive comes at a critical time - just before winter when it'll be harder to fight and the will of the west will be tested. The war is far from over. But Ukraine is once again showing the world its ability to surprise and overcome the odds.

Squid Game star makes history at the Emmys,"Squid Game actor Lee Jung-jae (left) and creator Hwang Dong-hyuk with their Emmy awards Squid Game's Lee Jung-jae has become the first Asian star to win the Emmy award for best male actor in a drama. The South Korean won for playing the main role of the increasingly desperate Seong Gi-hun in the hit Netflix show. The show's creator, Hwang Dong-hyuk, won the best drama series director prize, also the first Asian to do so. Ted Lasso won best comedy series for the second year in a row, while outstanding drama went to Succession, also for a second year running. The drama's British creator Jesse Armstrong made a jibe about the monarchy during his acceptance speech at the US TV industry's most prestigious ceremony of the year. ""It's a big week for successions - new King in the UK, this for us,"" he joked. ""Evidently a bit more voting involved in our winning than Prince Charles."" ""Keep it royalist, keep it royalist,"" the show's star Brian Cox, who was also on stage, told him after the audience went fairly quiet. Succession's Brian Cox (left) told creator Jesse Armstrong (right) to ""keep it royalist"" on stage Armstrong then added: ""I'm not saying that we're any more legitimate in our position than he is. We'll leave that to other people."" Another Succession cast member, Matthew Macfadyen, won best supporting drama actor for his portrayal of ambitious interloper Tom Wambsgans, which he said was a ""bonkers gift of a role"". However, Cox could not replicate last year's best actor win, losing out to Squid Game's Lee.

Lizzo was tearful as she collected her award, saying: ""When I was a little girl, all I wanted to see was me in the media. Someone fat like me, black like me, beautiful like me."" There was a muted build-up to the event, with some pre-show festivities called off following the death of Queen Elizabeth II last week. The British Film and Television Academy cancelled its traditional Hollywood tea party for nominees, while the Canadian consulate postponed its celebrations. But beyond the Succession speech, it was not mentioned during the ceremony, which was hosted by Saturday Night Live comedian Kenan Thompson and was the first full-scale Emmys since the pandemic. The Emmys are voted for by more than 25,000 members of the US Television Academy, which represents those in front of and behind the cameras.

'Mourning but celebrating' King Charles's NI visitIt is a bittersweet day for fans of the Royal Family in Northern Ireland as they await the new King.Northern Ireland,"King Charles waved to members of the public outside St Anne's Cathedral ""We're mourning but also celebrating"" was how one fan of the Royal Family described the mood in Royal Hillsborough. The village hosted the new King Charles III and Camilla, the Queen Consort. The royal couple then travelled to Belfast where thousands of people lined the streets hoping to catch a glimpse of them. Hillsborough wasgiven the prefix ""Royal"" in 2021to recognise its long connection with the Royal Family. People began lining its streets at 05:00 BST, hoping to see the royal couple on their way to and from Hillsborough Castle, the official royal residence in Northern Ireland. Some people sensibly brought camp chairs, picnics and thermal flasks of hot drinks, anticipating a long wait before seeing the King. Mother and daughter, Valerie and Hayley Stokes, have attended a number of royal events ""It's difficult, he's been in training for this all his life,"" said Valerie Stokes, who was in Royal Hillsborough since early morning with her daughter, Hayley. ""He has been handling it with grace,"" added Hayley. How can I see King Charles III in Northern Ireland? Royal events are nothing new to Valerie and Hayley, from Ballynahinch, County Down. They have attended several royal weddings - Charles and Diana; Charles and Camilla; William and Kate - and can now add the King's maiden Northern Ireland visit to their list. ""It was very important to us,"" said Hayley, but Valerie added that the reason for the occasion was ""bittersweet"". Queen Elizabeth II, pictured at the Giant's Causeway in 2016, visited Northern Ireland many times during her reign While it was the 19th time the royal couple had visited Northern Ireland together, it was the first since Charles became King followingthe death of his mother, Queen Elizabeth II, on Thursday. Unusually, the monarch's visit was announced in advance: Details are often kept under wraps, due to security concerns. But crowds were accommodated outside Hillsborough Castle and in front of Belfast City Hall, where the King's cavalcade passed on Tuesday afternoon. The visit caused some congestion and traffic delays. In Northern Ireland, people's attitudes to the monarchy tend to be linked to their national identity. For unionists - who want Northern Ireland to remain in the United Kingdom - the sovereign is the personhood of Britishness, embodying the authority of the crown as a unifying force across the UK's four nations. Nationalists - who want Northern Ireland to become part of the Republic of Ireland - generally do not recognise the sovereignty of the crown here. Unionists feel the loss of the late Queen most profoundly - and welcomed the new King most enthusiastically. Nationalist sentiment is reflected in the main parties' words during the last few days - focusing on paying tribute to the late Queen's role in the peace process, and remaining detached from ceremonies to mark the King's accession. While Northern Ireland is known for its divisions, there was little anti-royal sentiment among the crowds, both outside Hillsborough Castle and Belfast City Hall. Union flags were being waved proudly by many royal supporters. Rita Martin, Gertie Lorimour and Jean Sands travelled from Mountvale Nursing Home with their carers For Rita Martin and her friends, the royal visit was a chance to be a part of history, though the death of the Queen was a sad backdrop to the King's first visit to Northern Ireland as monarch. ""We wouldn't have missed it,"" said Rita, who travelled with Gertie Lorimour, Jean Sands and their carers from Mountvale Nursing Home in Dromore, County Down, to see the King. They were in place, front and centre at the entrance of Hillsborough Castle, from 07:10. While Barbara Green, from Hillsborough, didn't have far to travel, that didn't stop her from getting up early: She was in position at 05:00. She brought with her a picture of when King Charles - who was Prince of Wales at the time - awarded her an MBE for services to special education five years ago. Barbara Green met King Charles, who was then a prince, in 2017 ""It just means everything to me to be here today,"" said the former school principal. ""The people of Northern Ireland feel for him, and wish him and the Queen Consort well. ""We want to give strength to carry on - he needs our support."" Gail Hutchinson and Sally McCambley (right) are regular visitors to Hillsborough Castle For 84-year-old Sally, the Queen had been a constant in her life and she fondly remembered the Queen's many visits to Northern Ireland and how, in the early days, she would come in an open-top car. ""She was greatly loved,"" she said. ""She never put a foot wrong, but Charles will be a tremendous King. He has seen her do it up close."" In the end, it was a swift departure for the King and Camilla, after their engagements in Hillsborough Castle, with the cavalcade travelling to Belfast for a strict schedule of events - but those who stayed gave a big cheer and the occasional chant of God Save the King. Hundreds gathered at Belfast City Hall with smartphones in hand, eager to catch a glimpse of King Charles III At Belfast City Hall, Eleanor Neill, who is originally from Glasgow but now lives in Belfast's Sandy Row, dressed up for the occasion. Eleanor Neill first saw the King in Scotland Ms Neill described the new King as ""an honourable man"". She first met him in Scotland about 30 years ago and said: ""He loves this, coming out and seeing the people."" Four nurses, originally from the Philippines, were in Belfast to show their support for the Royal Family. ""We've been here for five years - we feel like we share in your culture, she was our Queen,"" said Justine Gudes. ""It's very sad, especially for anyone from the United Kingdom. ""She was a global icon."" Marilyn Reyes, Raynel Amora, Justine Gudes and Nicole Felix set up near Belfast City Hall Healthcare workers Jacqueline Harrison and Jacqueline Kell were in a celebratory mood, having rushed straight from their jobs eager to welcome the new King. Ms Harrison said: ""It's sad for him, we'll never see the likes of this again, but it's celebratory as well -  I'll be having a few drinks tonight!"" Healthcare workers, Jacqueline Kell (left) and Jacqueline Harrison (right) were joined by Aaliyah Wasson (centre) as they welcomed the King Emma Ellingham had travelled from Cookstown in County Tyrone and said that attending was a display of her Britishness. ""I feel very sorry for [the King], people forget they're only human. We all deal with it, their grief is very public and they deal with it really well,"" she said. ""Today's crowds... It's a lovely touch to see the level of respect he deserves."" For those hoping for a brief handshake, some were left slightly disappointed as the royal couple briskly drove past to meet time constraints. With a deafening roar of applause, a few cheers and the sound of Amazing Grace being piped across Donegall Square West, the fleeting display lasted mere seconds. ""Although it's lovely, all the same,"" smiled one onlooker. Onlookers watched along as the Royals attended a service at St Anne's Cathedral The lawn in front of City Hall was busy with people viewing the big screen Hazelwood Integrated College pupils Jo and James, both 15, are history students The King and Queen Consort arrived to St Anne's Cathedral to tumultuous applause and cheers and shouts of ""God save the King"". As more and more dignitaries, including Irish President Michael D Higgins, Prime Minister Liz Truss and Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister), arrived at Writers' Square the anticipation in the crowd grew with loud chatter and a helicopter circling overhead. North Belfast history students Jo, from Cliftonville, and James, from Rathcoole, wanted to see history being made. ""I was a wee bit heartbroken when the Queen died - I'm not going to lie,"" said James. ""I had never really thought about the Queen as a force in my life until she died and then it felt like something was missing,"" added Jo, who said it meant things were changing. Members of the Army benevolent fund visited Writers' Square on Tuesday Gail Adamson, Brian Hyndman and Brian Adamson, all from the Army benevolent fund, were among those in Writers' Square. Gail said it seemed very surreal to say that the UK now has a King. ""It's a real privilege to be here today to meet him,"" she added. Lucy McConville from Bloomfield Collegiate was delighted to have shaken hands with King Charles III For some of the crowd at Writers' Square, a long wait paid off with a short audience with the King. Some of the children who met him had the day off school and had and managed to get a handshake with him. Lucy McConville, from Bloomfield Collegiate in east Belfast, said: ""I got to shake his hand - I was trying to budge my way up the big crowd and I just stuck my hand out and shook his hand - now I can say I've met a royal!""

UK unemployment at lowest rate for 48 years,"The UK's jobs market, which has been buoyant since the economy began to recover from the pandemic, might be starting to turn, experts have warned. Although the unemployment rate fell to 3.6% in the three months to July - the lowest since 1974 - the employment rate and number of vacancies also fell. Rises in regular pay are also failing to keep up with rising living costs. ""The jobs boom that began six months after the pandemic is probably coming to an end now,"" said the boss of Reed. Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, James Reed, who chairs the recruitment business, said: ""There are still very large numbers of vacancies and people are still advertising a lot of jobs, and that's why we've seen unemployment continue to go down. ""The question is, what happens next? Will there be a jobs slump? That's a concern clearly but our data at the moment doesn't suggest that, because we've still got a large number of vacancies and a lot of employers are still struggling to recruit."" What is the UK inflation rate and why is it rising? Where the boss-worker power struggle goes next One reason for the fall in the unemployment rate is a rise in the number of people who are no longer looking for work, and so not counted in the figure. The inactivity rate rose to 21.7%,the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said,external, the highest since 2017. The squeeze on pay also remains, with rises in regular pay lagging behind inflation. When taking the rise in prices into account, the value of regular pay fell by 2.8%, the ONS said. Inflation - a measure of price rises - remains at a 40-year high of 10.1% and the latest figure, due out on Wednesday, is forecast to be higher. The continued gap between private and public sector pay growth was also visible from the ONS's figures. Average regular pay growth for the private sector was 6% in May to July, compared with 2% for the public sector. According to the ONS, that is the largest ever difference between private and public sector, outside of the height of the pandemic period. UK economy grew more slowly than expected in July Despite the jobless rate falling to its lowest rate for 48 years, other measures suggested that the jobs market might be beginning to turn. The number of job vacancies fell by the most in two years, down 34,000 between June and August, although the overall number of vacancies still remains historically high. The employment rate also slipped to 75.4%, a small drop from the previous three-month period. The EY Item Club said the fall in the unemployment rate masked some job market weakness. ""The decline in joblessness disguised what was only a modest 40,000 rise in employment, the smallest since January to March, with a rise in inactivity playing a bigger role in pushing unemployment down,"" said Martin Beck, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club. ""Moreover, the single-month data showed the number in work in July falling on three months earlier to the greatest extent since January 2021. This suggests that the weak economy is starting to have an adverse effect on the jobs market."" While the headline jobs numbers remain strong, with the unemployment rate at its lowest in nearly half a century and long-term joblessness down, there are some signs of a turn here. Firstly the lower unemployment rate is not really about a jobs boom, it is more reflective of fewer people actively looking for work. That in turn, in the very latest figures, arises out of record numbers of long-term sick. There could be an economic impact here from record NHS waiting lists. So the latest jobs numbers remain the silver lining on some dark economic clouds. Other elements here reflect the wider cost of living pressures. Real pay continues to fall sharply, especially for public sector workers. This is despite some high cash-terms pay growth. And despite a slowing economy, vacancies remain high. Labour shortages are in turn restraining businesses, and in particular could mean inflation remains higher for longer. There is one unemployed person per vacancy, a record low, and the jobs are not being filled. But if the government wants to ""go for growth"" that will have to change. Rob Sutton is facing challenges trying to recruit staff for his business. Rob Sutton is founder of RKW, the UK's largest manufacturer, distributor and designer of small domestic appliances. He employs 500 people in Stoke-on-Trent in the West Midlands and said his wage bill has gone up by more than Â£2.5m in the past two years. ""We are having to review our wage costs on a monthly basis because it is moving at that fast a speed,"" he said. ""It has been an absolute nightmare, where we are having to increase [wages] all the time so all our costs are going up and nothing is coming down at the moment. His business is expanding and trying to recruit more staff, but it has been a challenge. ""We've probably got around 20 vacancies that we cannot fill,"" he says. ""We've had examples where recruitment agencies have come onto our car park where our employees are parked and they put letters on the windscreens saying 'we will give you Â£1,000 to come and join the company' to entice them away because there has been a massive shortage of order picking and warehouse operators. ""That's mainly because a lot of the European workers have gone home pre-Covid."" Businesses have warned that the squeezed labour market is having a detrimental effect. ""With firms doing their best to keep afloat during a period of spiralling costs, they are also facing an extremely tight labour market which is further impacting their ability to invest and grow,"" said Jane Gratton from the British Chambers of Commerce. ""During a period of increasing inflation, and a stagnant economy, we cannot afford to let recruitment problems further dampen growth."" Tony Wilson, director at the Institute for Employment Studies, also warned that ""firms simply can't find the workers to fill their jobs"". ""This is holding back growth but also pushing up inflation, with pay growth in the private sector now running above 6% and contributing to even higher prices.""

Night trains planned for mourners headed to London,"Transport bosses have confirmed that extra train services will be running for people travelling to London to pay respects to the Queen. A limited service will run through the night on some routes. Demand is expected to be particularly heavy from Wednesday, when the public can attend the lying-in-state at Westminster Hall from 17:00 BST. The Rail Delivery Group said it was doing ""all it can"" to ensure smooth journeys during the period of mourning. The Queen, who died on Thursday aged 96, will lie in state in Westminster Hall for four full days before her funeral, meaning the public will be allowed to view her coffin. Hundreds of thousands, if not millions, are expected to travel to the capital. Only a handful of operators will be putting on night trains and they are expected to be very limited. For example, there will be an extra train per hour on some routes, and every two hours on some others. Avanti West Coast, which is still running a dramatically reduced timetable amid a staff shortage, will put on some more train services this week to help people travel to the capital. Services on Avanti's busiest route between Manchester and London are currently reduced to one per hour. From Tuesday until Thursday, between 9.35am and 5.55pm there will be four further trains from Manchester to London Euston, and four extra trains north from London to Manchester between 12.40pm and 8.40pm. On Friday, Avanti will be running three extra trains each way, between the same times. The Rail Delivery Group, which represents train companies, told customers to check journey planners for the most up-to-date information. It also warned that services to, and stations in, London would be ""extremely busy"" as a result and has urged passengers to leave plenty of time for travel during the official mourning period, which ends the day of the Queen's state funeral on Monday 19 September. Transport for London (TfL) and Network Rail said there were plans to ensure people could travel ""as easily as possible"". ""The transport industry is working hard to help people pay their respects in London and across the UK,"" said Sir Peter Hendy, chair of Network Rail. ""Please make sure you check before you travel as we expect the road and transport networks to be busy."" Network Rail said a normal timetable would be running on the day of the funeral, rather than a reduced one that might operate on a regular bank holiday, along with some additional services. What next? A day-by-day guide from now to the funeral Waiting in line during the night: Why I wanted to see the Queen's coffin When is the state funeral? Will shops close? And other questions Andy Byford, TfL's transport commissioner, said that while normal services were scheduled on the London Underground, ""there may be short notice changes and diversions as a result of the large number of people travelling and necessary road closures"". Some underground stations will be busier than normal, TfL said, with some disruption expected due to some stations being temporarily closed, or normal routes in and around stations being changed. People have been told to avoid Green Park tube station if possible, and to use others such as Victoria, Piccadilly Circus and St James' Park. The Elizabeth Line does not usually operate any services on a Sunday on the central section between Paddington and Abbey Wood, but this Sunday it will operate 12 trains an hour. Some bus services will be diverted because of road closures, including night buses, and some taxi ranks will be closed as cabs and coaches will be affected by road closures. National Express said London Victoria Coach station will be closed on 19 September. All of its London services will be diverted via Wembley Stadium, with the exception of journeys between London and Dover, Ramsgate and Luton and Stansted Airports. These services will be diverted via Stratford and Baker Street instead. For those travelling from further afield, Heathrow Airport has said some flights will be disrupted on Friday. Journeys could be cancelled or rescheduled in order to ensure silence over central London as the Queen's coffin is moved to Westminster Hall. Are you travelling to pay your respects to the Queen?

Aldi becomes Britainâs fourth largest supermarket,"Aldi has overtaken Morrisons to become the fourth-largest UK supermarket for the first time, according to data from research firm Kantar. Discounters are grabbing more market share as shoppers take steps to manage their budgets, Kantar said. Food prices are rising quickly as energy and fuel costs soar, and the war in Ukraine squeezes grain production and pushes up fertiliser costs. Kantar said food price inflation hit a record 12.4% in August. Milk, butter and dog food prices were rising especially quickly. Inflation in the UK has been rising at its fastest rate for 40 years as food prices climb with living costs eating into household budgets. What is the UK inflation rate and why is the cost of living rising? UK inflation: Food costs push price rises to new 40-year high ""It seems there's no end in sight to grocery inflation as the rate at which food and drink prices are increasing continues to accelerate,""said Kantar head of retail and consumer insight Fraser McKevitt,external. ""Shoppers are taking steps to manage their budgets including broadening the range of stores they visit, with the discount grocers benefiting."" Shoppers are also cutting back on spending by buying more own-brand products, with sales of the very cheapest value own-label products up by a third compared to last year. Nevertheless, Kantar said food price rises will push up the average annual grocery bill by Â£571 to Â£5,181. Kantar said Aldi's sales rose by almost a fifth in the 12 weeks to 4 September compared with a year earlier, giving it a market share of 9.3%. Aldi UK and Ireland chief executive Giles Hurley said shoppers were ""voting with their feet by choosing Aldi over full price traditional supermarkets"". Meanwhile, Morrisons' sales dropped by 4.1% over the same period, with its market share falling to 9.1%. Morrisons said market share was ""partly a function of new store openings"". ""Although Morrisons has not put on any significant new space for a while, some competitors are still opening many new stores,"" it said. However, it added that ""customers don't really care about market share statistics - they care about value, quality, provenance and service and that is where our focus is going to remain."" This feels like a real moment in the supermarket aisles. Aldi and Lidl have been steadily stealing customers and growing market share driven by hundreds of new store openings. And they're still expanding, unlike their bigger rivals. With no grocery home delivery service, the discounters didn't have a great pandemic, but they're now clearly back on form. According to Kantar, the grocery market is worth around Â£131bn, and both chains together have now nabbed 16% of it. Aldi is adding more than a billion pounds of sales a year at this current rate of growth. They don't have it all their own way though. The price gap isn't as big as it used to be. Tesco and Sainsbury's are price matching Aldi on many key products. But in these challenging times, Aldi and Lidl are benefiting from cash-strapped shoppers trying to manage their budgets, and they are on the march again. 1 - Tesco (26.9% market share) 2 - Sainsbury's (14.6%) 3 - Asda (14.1%) 4 - Aldi  (9.3%) 5 - Morrisons (9.1%) 6 - Lidl (7.1%) 7 - Co-op (6.5%) 8 - Waitrose (4.7%) 9 - Iceland (2.4%) 10 - Ocado (1.7%) Source: Kantar Data relates to the 12 weeks to 4 September 2022 Mr McKevitt said: ""Back at the start of the 2010s, Tesco, Sainsbury's, Asda and Morrisons together accounted for over three quarters of the sector but that traditional big four is no more. ""The discounters have seen dramatic sales increases in recent months, bringing more and more customers through their doors."" He said Aldi had consistently been opening stores, and that 14.2 million people had shopped at the grocer in the past three months. Aldi and Lidl have been expanding and growing their market share in the UK over the past decade. However, online grocer Ocado, which has also been growing, said it expected to see a small drop in sales this year as customers buy less and and look for cheaper items. Previously the company, which is a joint venture between Ocado Group and Marks & Spencer, had predicted a small increase in sales. In a trading update, Ocado said it expected earnings to be ""close to break-even"" this year as rising costs, including energy and dry ice, and the lower average value of people's shopping baskets offset a growth in the number of customers.

Rich to get twice as much support on bills - think tank,"Rich households will receive twice as much support aimed at reducing the cost of living than poorer households next year, a think tank has claimed. The Resolution Foundation said if the government cuts National Insurance and limits energy bill rises, richer homes will get support worth Â£4,700 in 2023, compared to Â£2,200 for the poorest. A typical household energy bill will be limited to Â£2,500 annually until 2024. The think tank said ""details and costings"" were missing from the plan. Support for the richest tenth of households will ""far exceed the level of support for the poorest tenth of households despite the latter being most exposed to high energy bills"", the Resolution Foundation, which focuses on low to middle income households, said. The huge support scheme could cost up to Â£150bn, but Prime Minister Liz Truss has refused to put a figure on it, saying ""extraordinary times call for extraordinary measures"". The Department for Business could not offer a comment when contacted by the BBC, due to the period of national mourning. What the new energy plan means for you Truss spends billions to cap soaring energy bills Under the government's Energy Price Guarantee, suppliers are limited in the amount that can be charged for each unit of energy. For a typical household - one that uses 12,000 kWh (kilowatt hours) of gas a year, and 2,900 kWh of electricity a year - it means they will pay an average of Â£2,500 a year on their energy bill for the next two years. Without this intervention, that annual bill would have been Â£3,549 a year. Last winter it was Â£1,277 a year. The support with energy bills will be available for households in England, Scotland and Wales with equivalent assistance for Northern Ireland. Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation and former Labour adviser, said the government's support was ""colossal"" and ""bold"", but warned families should ""still expect a tough winter ahead"", but still said limiting bills was ""absolutely the right thing to do in terms of providing support where it's needed."" The Resolution Foundation said the ""near-universalist intervention"" fitted with previous support offered in the form of a Â£150 council tax rebate and a Â£400 energy bill discount. The think tank added that targeted help had also been provided for lower income households through the benefits system, but said tax cuts benefitting the richest half of households meant ""the total package of government support now in place to support incomes in 2022-23 provides no more support to poorer than richer households"". The Energy Price Guarantee comes with an enormous price tag for the government. Although they won't state how much it may total, this report suggests it could be bigger than the banking bailout during the financial crisis. Think about that for a second. Although welcomed as some action after a summer of stasis, there are plenty of organisations saying that this huge sum of money is flowing in the wrong direction. Although most households had been facing the same huge price increase in October, those price rises do not affect everyone in the same way. Those with less money spend proportionately more of their income on energy, and are likely to have smaller properties to heat, which means they won't save as much with this guarantee, and will still struggle to pay bills at the current rate. There will be what the government is calling a ""fiscal event"" this month, and the pressure is mounting on the government to provide more detail and more targeted help for the poorest households. Although this was the first announcement of Liz Truss's premiership, the scale and the repercussions mean that it is likely to be the economically defining one. Paul Johnson, director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) recently described the support package as ""very poorly targeted"". ""Finding a way of targeting [support] to the many, many millions who really need it, without giving it to the many, many millions who don't, appears to be something that has stumped the Treasury and the government for finding a mechanism of achieving that,"" he said. The state intervention will be funded by government borrowing, adding to the UK's already large debt pile. The total cost of the support will depend on the cost of energy on the international energy markets, which can be volatile. Mr Johnson questioned: ""Is it the best way of spending the money? ""I rather suspect it is an inevitable way in the short run if everybody who needs help is to get that help, but I do think it's incredibly important that the government thinks through and gets to a better or more targeted way of supporting us as we get through to next winter."" Ms Truss has rejected calls to extend a windfall tax on gas and oil company profits to pay for the package, after calls from the Labour party, the Liberal Democrats and the SNP to do so. A windfall tax is a one-off tax imposed by a government on a company. The idea is to target firms that have benefitted from something they were not responsible for - in other words, a windfall. Mr Bell said that by ruling out ""any attempt"" to fund the government's new support through further windfall taxes, ""the welcome support today could have a nasty sting in terms of higher mortgage payments and higher taxes tomorrow"". A mini-Budget outlining how the government intends to payfor measures to tackle the cost-of-living crisis is set to take place this month. Other plans include lifting the ban on fracking and new licences for North Sea oil and gas, to boost domestic energy supplies.

Public urged to queue now to see coffin in Edinburgh,"Thousands of people filed past the Queen's coffin in St Giles' Cathedral, Edinburgh The public viewing of the Queen's coffin in Edinburgh has ended. About 33,000 people filed through St Giles' Cathedral where Her Majesty lay at rest for 24 hours. Many of them had queued through the night for the opportunity to pay their last respects to the Queen. The coffin left the cathedral at about 16:20 on Tuesday and was taken by road to Edinburgh Airport, before being flown on a C-17 Globemaster to RAF Northolt, near London. It will go on to Buckingham Palace ahead of lying in state at Westminster Hall for four days. Crowds line streets for Queen's farewell to Scotland St Giles' vigil: 'She asked if the Queen was with mummy in heaven' What next? A day-by-day guide from now to the funeral The Scottish government said ""people across the country"" had paid their respects, attended remembrance events and reflected ""on a life of service"". ""This has been a very special part of history for Scotland,"" a statement added. Mourners started filing into the cathedral on Monday evening to be part of the historic moment. Thousands waited through the night, joining the line at The Meadows, which is south of the cathedral where the coffin lay. A steady stream of people joined the queue at The Meadows on Tuesday Those wanting to attend the vigil were required to pick up wristbands at the start of the queue, more than a mile away from the church. The last of those were handed out at 13:00 and the doors to the cathedral were closed to the public just before 15:00. It is understand that everyone who had picked up an official wristband managed to file past the coffin. Officials had earlier warned that the wristband did not guarantee entry. Charlie, 68, and his mother Janet, 89, were the last two people allowed to join the queue in Edinburgh's Meadows. Huge crowds gathered outside St Giles' Cathedral as the Queen's coffin began its journey to Edinburgh Airport Having travelled from Cathcart in Glasgow, Charlie - pushing his mother in a wheelchair - said he was ""very honoured"" to be in the city for this ""very sombre occasion"". It was important for his mother Janet to see the Queen's coffin, he added. She married in 1952 and the first television set she bought was to watch the late monarch's coronation the following year. The final opportunity for people to pay their respects to Her Majesty in Scotland came along the route her cortege travelled to Edinburgh Airport. There is also still a floral tribute at the Palace of Holyroodhouse. Heavy traffic congestion and disruption was expected in the city after a series of road closures along the route to the airport.

India ad on road safety sparks dowry debate,"The government says the ad is meant to encourage the use of cars with six airbags An Indian government advertisement on road safety is being criticised for allegedly promoting dowry. The ad, which features Bollywood star Akshay Kumar, was tweeted by federal transport minister Nitin Gadkari. It shows Kumar scolding a father for sending away his newly-wed daughter in a car that has just two airbags. While some social media users praised the ad for highlighting safety, others felt it promoted dowry by hinting that the car was given by the father. Paying and accepting dowry is a centuries-old tradition in South Asia where the bride's parents gift cash, cars, clothes and jewellery to the groom's family. The practice is a punishable offence in India, but it continues to thrive - leaving women vulnerable to domestic violence and even death. Last year,a study found that dowry was paid in 95% of the marriagesin the country even though it's been illegal since 1961. The ad featuring Kumar was first shared on Twitter last week and it has since been watched more than a million times. It shows a teary eyed bride leaving with the groom as her family sees her off. The actor, who plays a policeman and a friend of the father, intervenes to say that the newly-wed couple would be a lot safer in a car with six airbags instead of just two. Allow Twitter content?

Several people pointed out that the ad was ill-conceived as it promoted making dowry payments instead of encouraging road safety practices. ""This ad promotes dowry; [it] should be removed and banned immediately,"" one social media user wrote on Twitter. Another user wrote, ""This ad is the pits. Lost the plot completely. Is this about the wedding, the bride or that dowry should be 6 airbag car-what is it? They couldn't talk about safety any other way?"". The campaign comes in the backdrop of a national conversation on road safety after the death of Indian billionaire Cyrus Mistry, who was killed in a car cash on 5 September. Some reports have suggested that he wasn't wearing the seat belt in the rear seat of his car. Indian law mandates seat belts for all car occupants, but this was rarely enforced for people in the rear seats. Every year, hundreds of thousands of people die in accidents on India's roads - in 2021, the toll was more than 150,000, an average of 18 per hour, according to government data. India insists on seat belts after tycoon's death Remembering India billionaire who died in car crash After Mistry's death, transport minister Mr Gadkari announced that people sitting in rear seats without seat belts would be fined. He also said that the government would make it compulsory for carmakers to install alarms for rear seat belts. Mr Gadkari's efforts have been praised by many on Twitter. However, some on Twitter have also asked the minister to pay attention to the poor condition of roads and faulty designs. Many have shared photos of poorly maintained roads and potholes found on national highways in recent days. Saket Gokhale, a spokesperson of the Trinamool Congress party, tweeted that the latest ad was an ""amazing way to deflect responsibility by pushing for 6 air bags (& expensive cars) instead of fixing roads"". Some have also pointed out that a car with six airbags was unaffordable for most people in India. The government should ""instead try to improve the road safety, design, lights, and [road] signs,"" a user wrote on Twitter. Mr Gadkari, however, has criticised carmakers for resisting the move, saying the cost of adding more airbags would not be significant when produced in high volumes.

Her coffin will move in a procession from Buckingham Palace to Westminster on Wednesday afternoon. Her son King Charles III will take part alongside her grandchildren, Princes William and Harry. The US House of Representatives has just observed a momentâs silence for the Queen. The lower chamber of Congress passed a bereavement resolution in honour of the late British sovereign, before adjourning for the day. Congressional leaders from both parties last week issued statements of tribute to the Queen. Speaker Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat, said the monarch âwas a pillar of leadership in the global arena and a devoted friend of freedomâ. House Republican leader Kevin McCarthy said the Queen ârepresented what it means to lead with conviction, selflessness, and faith in God and in her peopleâ. The former Archbishop of Canterbury, Dr
Rowan Williams, has been discussing the challenges facing the King and the UK as
the country enters a new phase in its history. Dr Williams told the BBCâs Newscast
podcast: âWeâre a society staring into a little bit of an abyss in the next few
months, where poverty and deprivation for quite a lot of people, are going to
be a major issue.â Talking about the role of King Charles
III, he said: âI think it is crucial that the new King give the message... that
he's committed to a society where nobody gets forgotten.â He went on to say: âLots of communities
are faced with really impossible choices about energy, about food, about their
general security. Itâs the biggest thing I know on the agenda of the new prime
minister and the new government. Itâs a watershed moment for them just as much
as for the monarchy.â Dr Williams said: âIf we can get through
this winter without collapse, we can manage with all those pressures, we will
have sent a very important message to the other end of Europe that we are
prepared to face some constraints for the sake of Ukraine.â Last Thursday, the government set
out its energy support plan which included limiting energy bill rises for all
households for two years, and six months for businesses. Newscastâs full interview with Dr Williams
is available on BBC Sounds. This video can not be played Energy, policing and Ukraine â news you may have missed. Kristian Johnsonreporting from London Truus Nayman is spending the night sat on a bench A small but extremely dedicated crowd are already waiting at the front
of the queue for the Queen's lying-in-state in London - and I have joined them. The group has grown to around 100 people and we will
be the first to enter Westminster Hall on Thursday evening. For now though, we
are waiting on the Albert Embankment Path near Lambeth Bridge, huddling
underneath umbrellas and wearing ponchos to shelter from the rain. Some have been here all day, including 85-year-old
Truus Nayman, who is spending the night sat on a bench. âItâs a very special atmosphere,â she said. Despite the rain, spirits remain high as people swap
stories about the Queen. There is a real sense of camaraderie as strangers
strike up close friendships to support one another as we wait - including
holding a spot in the line while neighbours go to the toilet or grab a coffee. âIâve got two friends and we will be doing a rota,"" said
Monica Farag. âThese will be my friends forever.â Westminster Hall is where King Charles III addressed members of parliament and peers on Monday - and where the Queen's coffin will lie in state from Wednesday. Built in 1097, the building has played a significant role in British history for centuries. It has hosted the trials of Charles I and Guy Fawkes, Henry VIII's coronation banquet, and speeches by well-known figures such as Nelson Mandela, French President Charles de Gaulle, Pope Benedict, and US President Barack Obama. The last member of the Royal Family to lie in state at Westminster was the Queen Mother in 2002, when more than 200,000 people queued to view her coffin. But it is not only royals who have lain in state in Westminster Hall. The same honour was extended to former Prime Minister Winston Churchill following his death in 1965 and to the victims of theR101 airship disaster of 1930. From Wednesday, the Queen's closed coffin will rest on a raised platform, known as a catafalque, beneath the 11th Century hall's medieval timber roof. Each corner of the platform will be guarded in a continuous vigil by soldiers that serve the Royal Household. The coffin will be draped in the Royal Standard and once in Westminster Hall it will be topped with the Imperial State Crown, orb and sceptre. Westminster Hall during Barack Obama's address in 2011 The Queen's coffin is now at rest at Buckingham Palace. The 775-room palace was her primary residence from the year of her coronation in 1953 until the beginning of the Covid pandemic in 2020. But the late monarch is said to have held mixed feelings towards the grand home. According to royal biographer Penny Junor in her book The Firm, the Queen had originally wanted to settle in Clarence House in London - where she had lived with her late husband Prince Philip after they were married in 1947. But following her coronation in 1953, Sir Winston Churchill, the prime minister at the time, pushed for the couple to move to Buckingham Palace, according to Junor. The Queen went onto live in Buckingham Palace's private quarters until 2020, when she made the move to Windsor Castle at the start of the pandemic. The Queen's coffin will travel from Buckingham Palace to Westminster Hall on Wednesday afternoon, where she will lie in state for four days. The King, his two sons Princes William and Harry, and other senior royals will walk behind the coffin. Watch the route the procession will take below: This video can not be played The King will be joined by his sons Princes William and Harry in a procession accompanying the Queenâs coffin from Buckingham Palace to
Parliament on Wednesday. The procession will leave the palace just after lunchtime and will arrive at Westminster Hall, where the Queen will lie in state for four days. The King will also be joined by his siblings Prince Andrew, the Princess Royal, and the Earl of Wessex. Peter Phillips, vice admiral Sir
Tim Laurence, the Duke of Gloucester and the Earl of Snowdon will also walk behind the coffin. Camilla, the Queen Consort, the Princess of Wales, the Countess of
Wessex and the Duchess of Sussex will travel to the hall by car. A short service lasting around 20 minutes will be led by the Archbishop of Canterbury accompanied by the Dean of Westminster. Toby LuckhurstReporting in London Barriers are being erected outside Parliament ahead of the Queen lying in state at Westminster Hall Authorities in London are preparing for huge numbers of people to pay their respects to the Queen as she lies in state in Westminster Hall for four days from Wednesday. Dozens of people in hi-vis jackets lined the
queueing route, snaking along the South Bank past St Thomasâ Hospital and
across Lambeth Bridge to the Palace of Westminster. Poorna was one of those working on the
bridge. He arrived at 6am for a 13 hour shift. ""There's a
night shift too,"" he said. ""It's going to be a long one."" On the north side of the river, rope lines are staked out in the grass of Victoria Tower Gardens, south of the Palace of
Westminster. Forklifts drop off portable toilet blocks in the
garden while security stand guard. Police have arrived from across the country
to help with the operation - with vans from the Lancashire Constabulary sitting just off
Parliament Square. The route for people queuing to see the Queen lying in state at Westminster Hall in Parliament has been released by the government. The line will start at Albert Embankment near Lambeth Bridge, and could stretch all the way to Southwark Park in south-east London. Those queuing are asked not to attempt to save a place for someone else, or leave personal items unattended, or put up tents. Once people reach the front of the queue, they will have to go through airport-style security before entering Parliament. Get more detailshere. The Queen with members of the Arsenal team in 2007 The Queen's coffin will rest in Buckingham Palace's Bow Room tonight, where it will be watched over by a rota of chaplains. The red-carpeted room in the west wing of the palace is named after the window that runs along its side. The late Queen hosted various distinguished guests in the Bow Room, including former US president George Bush, Premier League footballers, King Abdullah of Saudi Arabia, and the New Zealand All Blacks rugby team. George Bush being hosted at Buckingham Palace in 2003 Earlier today, the Queen's coffin was flown from Edinburgh to RAF Northolt in west London. From there, with thousands of people lining almost every part of the route, her hearse made its way to the palace in central London.

Wages still failing to keep up with rising prices,"The UK's jobs market, which has been buoyant since the economy began to recover from the pandemic, might be starting to turn, experts have warned. Although the unemployment rate fell to 3.6% in the three months to July - the lowest since 1974 - the employment rate and number of vacancies also fell. Rises in regular pay are also failing to keep up with rising living costs. ""The jobs boom that began six months after the pandemic is probably coming to an end now,"" said the boss of Reed. Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, James Reed, who chairs the recruitment business, said: ""There are still very large numbers of vacancies and people are still advertising a lot of jobs, and that's why we've seen unemployment continue to go down. ""The question is, what happens next? Will there be a jobs slump? That's a concern clearly but our data at the moment doesn't suggest that, because we've still got a large number of vacancies and a lot of employers are still struggling to recruit."" What is the UK inflation rate and why is it rising? Where the boss-worker power struggle goes next One reason for the fall in the unemployment rate is a rise in the number of people who are no longer looking for work, and so not counted in the figure. The inactivity rate rose to 21.7%,the Office for National Statistics (ONS) said,external, the highest since 2017. The squeeze on pay also remains, with rises in regular pay lagging behind inflation. When taking the rise in prices into account, the value of regular pay fell by 2.8%, the ONS said. Inflation - a measure of price rises - remains at a 40-year high of 10.1% and the latest figure, due out on Wednesday, is forecast to be higher. The continued gap between private and public sector pay growth was also visible from the ONS's figures. Average regular pay growth for the private sector was 6% in May to July, compared with 2% for the public sector. According to the ONS, that is the largest ever difference between private and public sector, outside of the height of the pandemic period. UK economy grew more slowly than expected in July Despite the jobless rate falling to its lowest rate for 48 years, other measures suggested that the jobs market might be beginning to turn. The number of job vacancies fell by the most in two years, down 34,000 between June and August, although the overall number of vacancies still remains historically high. The employment rate also slipped to 75.4%, a small drop from the previous three-month period. The EY Item Club said the fall in the unemployment rate masked some job market weakness. ""The decline in joblessness disguised what was only a modest 40,000 rise in employment, the smallest since January to March, with a rise in inactivity playing a bigger role in pushing unemployment down,"" said Martin Beck, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club. ""Moreover, the single-month data showed the number in work in July falling on three months earlier to the greatest extent since January 2021. This suggests that the weak economy is starting to have an adverse effect on the jobs market."" While the headline jobs numbers remain strong, with the unemployment rate at its lowest in nearly half a century and long-term joblessness down, there are some signs of a turn here. Firstly the lower unemployment rate is not really about a jobs boom, it is more reflective of fewer people actively looking for work. That in turn, in the very latest figures, arises out of record numbers of long-term sick. There could be an economic impact here from record NHS waiting lists. So the latest jobs numbers remain the silver lining on some dark economic clouds. Other elements here reflect the wider cost of living pressures. Real pay continues to fall sharply, especially for public sector workers. This is despite some high cash-terms pay growth. And despite a slowing economy, vacancies remain high. Labour shortages are in turn restraining businesses, and in particular could mean inflation remains higher for longer. There is one unemployed person per vacancy, a record low, and the jobs are not being filled. But if the government wants to ""go for growth"" that will have to change. Rob Sutton is facing challenges trying to recruit staff for his business. Rob Sutton is founder of RKW, the UK's largest manufacturer, distributor and designer of small domestic appliances. He employs 500 people in Stoke-on-Trent in the West Midlands and said his wage bill has gone up by more than Â£2.5m in the past two years. ""We are having to review our wage costs on a monthly basis because it is moving at that fast a speed,"" he said. ""It has been an absolute nightmare, where we are having to increase [wages] all the time so all our costs are going up and nothing is coming down at the moment. His business is expanding and trying to recruit more staff, but it has been a challenge. ""We've probably got around 20 vacancies that we cannot fill,"" he says. ""We've had examples where recruitment agencies have come onto our car park where our employees are parked and they put letters on the windscreens saying 'we will give you Â£1,000 to come and join the company' to entice them away because there has been a massive shortage of order picking and warehouse operators. ""That's mainly because a lot of the European workers have gone home pre-Covid."" Businesses have warned that the squeezed labour market is having a detrimental effect. ""With firms doing their best to keep afloat during a period of spiralling costs, they are also facing an extremely tight labour market which is further impacting their ability to invest and grow,"" said Jane Gratton from the British Chambers of Commerce. ""During a period of increasing inflation, and a stagnant economy, we cannot afford to let recruitment problems further dampen growth."" Tony Wilson, director at the Institute for Employment Studies, also warned that ""firms simply can't find the workers to fill their jobs"". ""This is holding back growth but also pushing up inflation, with pay growth in the private sector now running above 6% and contributing to even higher prices.""

The South Korean won for playing the main role of the increasingly desperate Seong Gi-hun in the hit Netflix show. The show's creator, Hwang Dong-hyuk, won the best drama series director prize, also the first Asian to do so. Ted Lasso won best comedy series for the second year in a row, while outstanding drama went to Succession, also for a second year running. The drama's British creator Jesse Armstrong made a jibe about the monarchy during his acceptance speech at the US TV industry's most prestigious ceremony of the year. ""It's a big week for successions - new King in the UK, this for us,"" he joked. ""Evidently a bit more voting involved in our winning than Prince Charles."" ""Keep it royalist, keep it royalist,"" the show's star Brian Cox, who was also on stage, told him after the audience went fairly quiet. Succession's Brian Cox (left) told creator Jesse Armstrong (right) to ""keep it royalist"" on stage Armstrong then added: ""I'm not saying that we're any more legitimate in our position than he is. We'll leave that to other people."" Another Succession cast member, Matthew Macfadyen, won best supporting drama actor for his portrayal of ambitious interloper Tom Wambsgans, which he said was a ""bonkers gift of a role"". However, Cox could not replicate last year's best actor win, losing out to Squid Game's Lee. Fellow Briton Brett Goldstein was among the night's other acting winners, alongside Zendaya, Amanda Seyfried, Michael Keaton, Julia Garner and Jean Smart. Euphoria star Zendaya won her second Emmy for best lead drama actress in three years Zendaya won best drama actress for a second time for playing teenage drug addict Rue in Euphoria, following her win in 2020. ""Anyone who has loved a Rue or feels like they are a Rue - I want you to know I'm so grateful for your stories, and I carry them with me, and I carry them with her,"" she said on stage. Ted Lasso star Jason Sudeikis repeated his 2021 success by winning best leading comedy actor for playing the titular football coach. His win was mirrored by his co-star Goldstein, who won best supporting actor in a comedy series for playing Lasso's assistant coach Roy Kent for the second year running. Sheryl Lee Ralph sang during her acceptance speech Emmy TV awards 2022: The key winners Adele: I officially have an EGO Obama wins Emmy for narrating Netflix documentary Popular newcomer Abbott Elementary, a mockumentary set in a US primary school, also had a share of the success when Sheryl Lee Ralph won best supporting actress in a comedy. She plays no-nonsense teacher Barbara Howard and isthe first black actress to win in this category since 1987.,external She sang the opening lines of Dianne Reeves' song Endangered Species after accepting her award, adding in an impassioned speech afterwards: ""This is what believing looks like."" Her co-star and the show's creator Quinta Brunson won the award for comedy series writing, although her acceptance speech was partly overshadowed by talk show host Jimmy Kimmel lying down on the stage in an apparently comic moment after he lost a previous award.

Julia Garner's character Ruth was a fan favourite on Ozark Keaton won his first Emmy for his role as a small-town doctor in opioid crisis drama Dopesick, replicating his Golden Globe win earlier this year. Keaton, who took time out of the industry for a few years, referred to his ""doubters"" and ""believers"" during his speech. ""There have been some doubters. I've had some doubters. You know what? We're cool,"" he said. Singer Lizzo won her first Emmy for best reality competition for Watch Out For The Big Grrrls, a category recently dominated by RuPaul's Drag Race. The show offers plus-size dancers the chance to compete to join the About Damn Time singer on tour. Lizzo got teary during her speech and asked the audience to ""Make some noise for my big girrrls!"" Lizzo was tearful as she collected her award, saying: ""When I was a little girl, all I wanted to see was me in the media. Someone fat like me, black like me, beautiful like me."" There was a muted build-up to the event, with some pre-show festivities called off following the death of Queen Elizabeth II last week. The British Film and Television Academy cancelled its traditional Hollywood tea party for nominees, while the Canadian consulate postponed its celebrations. But beyond the Succession speech, it was not mentioned during the ceremony, which was hosted by Saturday Night Live comedian Kenan Thompson and was the first full-scale Emmys since the pandemic. The Emmys are voted for by more than 25,000 members of the US Television Academy, which represents those in front of and behind the cameras. This year's awards honour the best TV shows that premiered or streamed between 1 June 2021 and 31 May 2022.
