A million more will struggle to pay energy bills,"More than a million extra British households won't be able to afford to heat and power their homes next spring, according to a charity. Energy bills are expected to rise again in April to reflect the rising wholesale price of gas. National Energy Action says 1.2 million to 1.5 million additional households will be plunged into fuel poverty. Households that spend a high proportion of their income on energy bills are considered to be in fuel poverty. At the start of October the energy price cap, which limits the impact of rising energy prices on households in England, Scotland and Wales, was raised to take the sharply rising wholesale gas price into account. But Ofgem, the energy regulator, said the price cap would have to rise again next year if wholesale gas prices continue to go up. Analysts said this could mean a typical customer paying between Â£400 and Â£600 more per year. Households in Northern Ireland have also seen a recent sharp rise in their bills, but they aren't protected by the energy price cap for Great Britain. If you feel powerless against international business and politics when watching your domestic energy bill go up, you are in good company. Normally, customers are urged to get active, search and switch to save money - but not now. Until recently, the energy price cap was a backstop, protecting the vulnerable. Now it is the most competitive tariff available. The cap is shielding households from the wild fluctuation in prices seen on the wholesale markets, but that is only a crumb of comfort when bills and prices across the board are still expected to see a sharp increase. So for now, experts simply advise customers to find ways to save energy, brace themselves and budget for bigger bills. Wrap up for a financial chill that could last longer than the winter. National Energy Action (NEA) said this month's price rises had already pushed half a million more households into fuel poverty. ""It's building into a brutal and bleak winter for millions. If the price cap goes up by Â£400 to Â£600 a year it could plunge 1.2 to 1.5 million households into fuel poverty, leaving almost 5.5 million households struggling to keep their homes warm and safe,"" said NEA chief executive Adam Scorer. NEA is calling for more support to be put in place for low income households. Ofgem, the energy regulator, said it expected prices would rise further in April. Its chief executive Jonathan Brearley said the energy cap was ""designed to reflect fair costs and therefore will need to adjust over time"". Natural gas prices are at record highs as economies around the world begin to recover from the Covid crisis. As a result, firms that supply gas to householders are running into trouble because they have agreed to sell energy at less than the price it now costs them to buy it. Even with the raising of the cap this month Mr Brearley said more energy firms could run into difficulties. ""Given the continued volatility in the market, it is likely more suppliers will exit the market,"" he told an energy conference on Thursday. Nine firms have already gone out of business, forcing 1.7 million customers to move to new suppliers. Those households have already seen annual bill increases of hundreds of pounds, since new providers aren't able to match lower-rate fixed deals that were on offer when gas prices were lower. What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? Energy price cap: Why are fuel bills rising? UK gas prices fall from record high after Russia steps in Firms warn of price rises as energy costs soar Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, who was also attending the conference, said the right response to rising gas prices was to renew the UK's commitment to renewable energy. The government recently pledged to shift electricity generation away from fossil fuels entirely by 2035. ""The UK so far, as many of you know, has made great progress in diversifying our energy mix. But we are still very dependent, perhaps too dependent, on fossil fuels and their volatile prices,"" he said. Decarbonising heating and power would mean lower prices he said. ""Our homes and businesses will be powered by affordable, clean and secure electricity generated here in the UK, for people in the UK,"" Mr Kwarteng said. However, customers will question whether the cost of the making the transition to lower carbon energy could push bills higher in the short term. The next revision to the energy price cap will be decided by Ofgem in February but will come into force in April. Analysts Cornwall Insight said that the cap could go up by Â£400 meaning that a household with typical energy use would pay around Â£1,660 a year. However the Energy Shop - a price comparison site - warned people to prepare themselves for even greater increases in household bills. It said that the next increase in the price cap could be Â£500 or even higher. Founder Joe Malinowski warned: ""If things don't settle down soon, increases of Â£600, Â£700 or even Â£800 cannot be ruled out."" Businesses are also feeling the impact of rising energy costs. Firms are warning that could lead tohigher prices for their goodsas increases are passed on to consumers. Richard Walker, managing director of supermarket chain Iceland, said steep rises in energy bills and other costs meant price rises were now ""inevitable"". ""The UK supermarket industry is one of the most competitive in the world,"" he told the BBC. ""Our margins are very tight and we're not an endless sponge that can just absorb all of these different cost increases."" Mark Nicholson and his business partner set up their firm Harvey George Furniture four years ago in Hull. Today they employ about 30 people making bespoke bathroom and bedroom furniture. The past 18 months have been so good that they've moved premises to expand - and invested about Â£500,000 in new technology and machinery to keep up with demand. ""It's a gas guzzler - unfortunately for us it's a big gas guzzler,"" he says of their new painting machine, which is piped into the mains and is able to produce colourful furniture much faster. ""Any business, it's about cost and quite a big component for us is energy, so it's quite a scary thought. Our last bill was Â£8,000 - it was a shock. ""We'll keep going. But we could just do with some stability on our costs. It feels like everything - rates, recruitment, materials, shipping - now energy... feels very up and down."" The energy price cap sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff. That includes the fixed daily amount customers pay, plus the price per unit they pay for electricity and gas. When the cap was increased on 1 October, about 15 million households faced a 12% rise in energy bills, the biggest jump, to the highest amount, seen since the backstop was introduced in January 2019. Those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, saw an increase of Â£139 - from Â£1,138 to Â£1,277 a year. Prepayment meter customers with average energy use saw a Â£153 increase. That is a far cry from a year previously when on 1 October 2020, the energy price cap was cut by Â£84, to Â£1,042.

Nightclubs to reopen as social distancing scrapped,"Nightclubs have been closed in Northern Ireland since March 2021 The legal requirement for social distancing in bars and restaurants is to be removed. Nightclubs are also to be allowed to reopen, meaning legal restrictions on dancing in venues will be scrapped. Restrictions will be lifted from 31 October. A number of mitigations have been agreed and it is thought businesses will be asked to check for vaccine certificates, but this will not be a legal requirement. Ministers have also agreed to retain the mandatory wearing of face coverings in certain settings. It is understood ministers were advised that moving legal regulations on face coverings into guidance would lead to a 30% decline in their use. The industry had argued that social distancing requirements were damaging trade. The new rules mean people will be able to move around pubs and restaurants and to eat and drink while standing up. Changes were also announced tothe UK travel red list, which has been cut from 54 countriesto seven. Michelle O'Neill and Paul Givan announced the rule changes at Stormont First Minister Paul Givan welcomed the easing of restrictions, particularly for the the hospitality sector, which he said had been hit hard during the pandemic. ""I'm pleased that at the end of this month they will be able to operate in a much more sustainable and viable way,"" he said. Mr Givan said the sector benefitted from ""a high level of adherence"" to coronavirus restrictions, adding that he believed this would continue. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she was pleased progress had been made at Thursday's executive meeting, but that people should remain cautious. ""We're in for an uncertain period ahead and we have to work our way through that as best we can,"" she said. Ms O'Neill said continuing increasing vaccination rates would also be a ""crucially important"" part of the executive's winter planning. Under existing rules, social distancing of at least 1m (3ft) remains a legal requirement in pubs, bars and restaurants in Northern Ireland. From Thursday 14 October the restrictions on the number of people allowed to meet inside a home is to be increased from 15 from four households to 30 from an unlimited number of households. From that date, people attending performances at indoor venues will not have to be seated during the performance. The executive is now moving to unlock the final stage of pandemic recovery. Nightclubs will finally get to reopen on Halloween and social distancing - something we've lived with as the norm for the past 18 months - will be scrapped. It's perhaps no surprise given how that's already the case in Great Britain and the rules south of the Irish border will end this month too. But not everything is changing - face coverings will remain - a sign that for some, caution is still needed with Covid. The executive has also warned that if things begin to go in the wrong direction again, vaccine passports could then be deployed. The Department of Health will now progress work on the system after agreement with Executive Office officials - but the onus on hospitality businesses will be to prove that a mandatory scheme isn't needed. John Leighton, owner of Bennigan's Bar, Londonderry, said easing restrictions for hospitality was fantastic news, which the sector ""had been waiting on for some time"". He said it had been a challenging and stressful time for the sector and that the timing to ease restrictions on 31 October was particularly good for Derry's annual Halloween festival. ""It means we can get back to enjoying ourselves and not having so many things to think about,"" he said. ""We can get back to a bit more normality."" Janice Gault from the Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said the restrictions which are being removed had presented ""significant challenges"" for businesses which were trying to become fully operational again. She said: ""The industry has traded well to date and our primary focus remains the health and well-being of our staff and customers. ""Winter trade, in a viable manner within a sustainable framework and without further lockdown, is our aim."" In September, the executive agreed toend social distancing restrictionsfor shops, theatres and a number of other indoor settings. They asked some sectors to put in place mitigations including proof of double vaccination or a negative lateral flow test. But this is advice and is not legally enforceable. Robin Swann is frustrated over plans to introduce a vaccine passport Last week,Health Minister Robin Swann warnedthat a delay by the executive in agreeing a vaccine passport policy had limited options for easing more restrictions. The Department of Health will now progress work to develop the digital scheme, but ministers will have to decide whether to deploy it. Ms O'Neill said she did not want things to reach that point and hoped businesses would voluntarily comply with executive advice and demonstrate they could work safely. Ministers also discusseda bid from Communities Minister Deirdre Hargeyfor Â£55m in funding to mitigate the end of a Â£20 weekly uplift for people claiming universal credit. Stormont received an extra Â£180m from the Treasury in September and that money has yet to be distributed. The expectation was that most if not all of that money would go on health spending. Mr Givan and Ms O'Neill made clear that Stormont would face major difficulties - both financially and logistically - of stepping in to top up payments Mr Givan said the Executive had to be ""honest"" with the public about the financial position. ""Now is not the time to be removing this uplift,"" he said. ""That is happening though this week and the ability, even if the executive had the funding, to do this [top up the payments] isn't there because we don't have the systems, this is administered directly through the Department for Work and Pensions in London. ""So we don't have the system. And the ability to finance it - we have to be honest with the public.""

Labour shortage human disaster for pig farms - NFU,"Pig farmers are facing a ""human disaster"" due to a shortage of abattoir workers, the National Farmer's Union has said. Farmers are already having to destroy healthy pigs due to a backlog on farms, the union said. Time is running out for the UK pig sector, the National Pig Association (NPA) warned. But a government minister said businesses should pay higher wages and invest in skills. The industry blames the shortage of people to slaughter pigs in abattoirs on factors including Covid and Brexit. The chronic labour shortage has led to an estimated backlog of 85,000 pigs on farms, with an extra 15,000 being added per week, according to NPA figures. The industry association warned on Thursday,externalthat ""empty retail shelves and product shortages are becoming increasingly commonplace and Christmas specialities, such as pigs in blankets are already under threat"". ""The knock-on effect of the staff shortages is having a devastating effect on the country's pig farmers,"" the NPA said. Pig cull threat not being taken seriously by PM, says vet Abattoir labour shortage sees Yorkshire farmer kill piglets ""We are already seeing producers up and down the country getting out of pigs or cutting down on numbers because they cannot sustain these losses any longer,"" NPA chief executive Zoe Davies said. ""Without immediate government intervention, more producers will be pushed over the edge."" ""Sadly we are expecting a serious contraction of the UK pig industry,"" she added, saying mainly smaller independent farmers were affected. Around 600 pigs have already been killed to deal with overcrowding, and a mass cull is the next stage,the industry association has said. Speaking on BBC Question Time, National Farmers Union president Minette Batters said the UK is the ""first country in the world facing a cull of healthy livestock"". She said pigs were having to be destroyed using either a bolt gun or lethal injection, and added: ""As far as I'm concerned this is the start and it has to be resolved. ""This is livelihoods and this is people's businesses. ""This has been a human disaster for those pig farmers who are absolutely distraught."" She said that the government must address labour shortages unless we ""don't want a pig industry in this country"" which she argued would mean ""we will import pig meat that is produced to lower standards."" Ms Batters said Environment Secretary George Eustice and Cabinet Office minister Stephen Barclay were doing ""everything"" they can, but said she had not been able to see Home Secretary Priti Patel to discuss more migrant visas to address shortages. But Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said the government was working with the industry to find sustainable solutions and that issuing temporary visas was ""not enough"". He also said shortages were happening elsewhere in the world. Mr Zahawi added that Prime Minister Boris Johnson was ""right"" to challenge businesses to pay higher wages and invest in skills. But a top vet said on Wednesday that Mr Johnson wasnot taking the prospect of a national pig cull seriously.

State and private schools cash gap doubles - study,"The gap between private-school fees and state-school per-pupil spending in England has more than doubled over the past decade, the Institute for Fiscal Studies says. Average fees, of Â£13,600, were more than 90% higher than the Â£7,100 spent on state-school pupils in 2020-21, compared with a gap of 39% in 2009-10. For sixth-formers, fees are about three times higher than per-student funding. The government says schools are having the biggest funding uplift in a decade. Could Labour really ban private schools? School funding warning as pupils return to class Heads warn of Â£5.7bn school funding gap While private-school fees have grown by more than 20% above inflation since 2009-10, state-school per-pupil spending has fallen by 9% in real terms. And the gap in resource levels is probably even larger, the IFS researchers say, as the figures do not include other forms of income for private schools, such as account investment and endowments or gifts. ""Longstanding concerns about inequalities between private- and state-school pupils, which have come into sharp focus during the pandemic, will not begin to be easily addressed while the sectors enjoy such different levels of resourcing,"" Luke Sibieta said. Labour's shadow education secretary, Kate Green, said: ""School budgets have been hammered over the last decade, which is holding children back. ""As state-school class sizes have soared and enriching activities - art, sport, music, drama - have been cut back, the gap with private schools has grown ever wider."" Association of School and College Leaders general secretary Geoff Barton said: ""It is pretty outrageous that the government has cut funding in real terms to schools and colleges over the past decade, while independent school fees have increased over the same period. ""The funding gap between the two sectors has always been there of course but the fact it has widened to such a huge extent does stick in the throat. ""Surely the government should want the same opportunities for all children and young people. ""It may be naive to think that state education funding could match the independent sector but it surely shouldn't actually go into reverse."" A Department for Education spokesman said: ""This government is providing the biggest uplift to school funding in a decade - Â£14bn in total over the three years to 2022-23. ""This includes a Â£7.1bn increase in funding for schools by 2022-23, compared to 2019-20 funding levels. ""Next year, funding through the schools national funding formula (NFF) is increasing by 2.8% per pupil compared to 2021-22. ""The NFF continues to distribute this fairly, based on the needs of schools and their pupil cohorts.""

Saudi-led takeover of Newcastle completed,"This video can not be played Newcastle co-owner Amanda Staveley speaks to BBC Sports Editor Dan Roan on day Saudi takeover was completed A Saudi Arabian-backed Â£305m takeover of Newcastle United has been completed. The Premier League has approved the takeover after receiving ""legally binding assurances"" that the Saudi state would not control the club. Instead the Public Investment Fund (PIF), which will provide 80% of funds for the deal, is seen as separate to the state. This is despite the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, being listed as chair of PIF. The sale went through after the deal passed the Premier League owners' and directors' test. The takeover brings to an end Mike Ashley's 14-year spell as Newcastle United owner. Fans gathered outside Newcastle's St James' Park stadium on Thursday to celebrate the takeover being approved. PIF have assets of Â£250bn, making Newcastle one of the richest clubs in the world. Financier Amanda Staveley, who fronted the consortium, said the new owners are making a ""long-term investment"" to ensure Newcastle are ""regularly competing for major trophies"". Newcastle's last major domestic trophy was the 1955 FA Cup. Football Daily: New era for Newcastle United What's next for Newcastle after Â£305m takeover? Newcastle's 14 years of lost hope under Ashley This video can not be played Alan Shearer speaks to BBC Breakfast about Newcastle United takeover A Premier League statement said: ""The Premier League, Newcastle United Football Club and St James Holdings Limited have today settled the dispute over the takeover of the club by the consortium of PIF, PCP Capital Partners and RB Sports & Media. ""The legal disputes concerned which entities would own and/or have the ability to control the club following the takeover. All parties have agreed the settlement is necessary to end the long uncertainty for fans over the club's ownership. ""The Premier League has now received legally binding assurances that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will not control Newcastle United Football Club. ""All parties are pleased to have concluded this process which gives certainty and clarity to Newcastle United Football Club and their fans."" A deal was initially agreed in April 2020, but the buyers walked away four months later when the Premier League offered arbitration to settle a disagreement on who would control the club. It is believed that a resolution came after Saudi Arabia settled an alleged piracy dispute with Qatar-based broadcaster beIN Sports, which own rights to show Premier League matches in the Middle East. But sources have told BBC Sport that an agreement between the Premier League and the consortium was reached prior to news emerging on Wednesday that the piracy dispute had been resolved. The Saudi Arabian state has been accused of human rights abuses, but with the majority owner PIF deemed a separate entity, that, and any piracy issues, were no longer an impediment to the takeover, in the Premier League's view. Western intelligence agencies believe the crown prince ordered the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 - which he denies. PCP Capital chief executive Amanda Staveley will take a seat on Newcastle's board, while Yasir Al-Rumayyan, the governor of PIF, will act as the club's non-executive chairman. Staveley told BBC sports editor Dan Roan that PCP Capital took concerns over Saudi Arabia's human rights record ""very seriously"" but reiterated that their partner ""is not that Saudi state, it's PIF"". When asked if this was a case of 'sportswashing' by Saudi Arabia, she said: ""No, not at all, this is very much about the PIF's investment into a fantastic football team and we look forward to growing the club.""

Saudi Arabia has been accused of human rights abuses and women's rights campaigners have been imprisoned, despite some reform under Mohammed bin Salman, such as an end to the ban on women driving. Homosexuality is outlawed in the countryand the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association says the death penalty is the legally prescribed punishment for same-sex sexual acts in Saudi Arabia. Amnesty International UK said the takeover is ""an extremely bitter blow for human rights defenders"". ""We can understand that this will be seen as a great day by many Newcastle United fans,"" said chief executive Sacha Deshmukh. ""But it's also a very worrying day for anyone who cares about the ownership of English football clubs and whether these great clubs are being used to sportswash human rights abuse."" Deshmukh reiterated Amnesty International's call for the Premier League to ""change their owners' and directors' test to address human rights issues"". Khashoggi's fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, previously urged the Premier League not to allow the move to go through, citing the involvement of the crown prince. This video can not be played Newcastle United takeover: Mike Ashley's turbulent 14 years Sports Direct chief executive Ashley bought Newcastle for Â£134m in May 2007. He first put the club up for sale in September 2008 amid a series of protests from fans following the resignation of popular manager Kevin Keegan. Newcastle were relegated from the Premier League that season and again in 2015-16, although returned to the top flight at the first opportunity both times by winning the Championship. The Magpies' highest Premier League finish during Ashley's ownership was fifth in 2011-12 under Alan Pardew. Ashley put Newcastle up for sale again in October 2017. The club are 19th and winless after seven games this season, with boss Steve Bruce under pressure - a Newcastle United Supporters' Trust (NUST) survey said this week 94% of fans want Bruce to leave.

UK public now eating significantly less meat,"Daily meat consumption in the UK has fallen by 17% in the last decade, a study has shown. That reduction though is not happening quickly enough to meet a key national target, according to scientists. The aim is to reduce the environmental impact of our diets. This goal, set by theNational Food Strategy,external, is based on a review of the whole UK food system - from farming and production to hunger and sustainability. It recommends meat consumption in the UK fall by 30% over the next 10 years. Climate change food calculator: What's your diet's carbon footprint? Should there be a tax on red meat? Cows trained to use special 'MooLoo' toilet ""We now know we need a more substantial reduction,"" said lead researcher Cristina Stewart from the University of Oxford. The new study,published in the journal the Lancet Planetary Health,external, revealed that while most people are eating less red and processed meat compared to a decade ago, they are eating more white meat. High consumption of red and processed meat can increase the risk of health problems including cardiovascular disease, type 2 diabetes, and even certain cancers. Meat production also has a higher environmental impact - producing more planet-warming greenhouse gas emissions - than other types of agriculture and food production. The environmental impact of raising livestock varies hugely and locally produced meat is generally more sustainable This Oxford-based research team used data from the National Diet and Nutrition Survey - a detailed survey of the dietary habits of more than 15,000 people across the country. This showed that daily meat consumption had reduced by about 17g per person per day. What it did not reveal was the reason people were changing their diets. But market research in 2019 suggested that almost 40% of meat-eaters were actively trying to reduce their consumption, with many citing either health or environmental reasons. Dr Stewart stresses that, for those who want to reduce the environmental impact of what they eat, ""any reduction in meat will have an impact"". ""You don't have to be vegetarian,"" she said. ""Although, in general, meat-free dishes will have a lower impact. ""But if you're someone that eats meat every day, reducing your meat consumption by 30% just looks like having two meat-free days per week."" There is huge variation in the environmental impact of meat; it depends on what livestock are fed and where and how the meat is produced. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives. Why the COP26 climate summit is important What will climate change look like for you? Will the UK meet its climate targets? Simple guide to climate change ""Locally produced meat has a much lower impact than meat that has been imported,"" Dr Stewart pointed out. She and her colleagues have also been studying the effect of ""environmental impact labelling"" on consumer choices. They have designed experimental labels that score a product based on its greenhouse gas emissions, biodiversity loss, water-use and water pollution. ""When you don't have the information about environmental impact of food, it's really hard to shop with that in mind,"" she pointed out. Having the support of those we eat our meals with, the Oxford researchers say, makes it easier for us to change our diets. And the availability and prominence of meat-free food options has an effect on people's food choices, too. ""So, for example, if you're at a restaurant, you often see a vegetarian options 'box of shame' at the bottom of the menu rather than at the top with chef's specials,"" Dr Stewart explained. The team's ongoing study of what drives people to reduce their meat consumption,externalhas revealed some simple strategies that participants have found helpful, including: Trying one new vegetarian recipe; Making one meal in a day vegetarian, rather than going a whole day without meat; Reducing portion size: In a recipe that includes meat, like a bolognese, reduce the amount of meat and supplement that with lentils and vegetables. ""Hopefully this paper will help us understand the patterns and trends so we can tailor public health policies and behavioural nudges to help people choose more sustainable options,"" said Dr Stewart.

Child poverty fears as Â£20 top-up ends - Rashford,"This video can not be played Rashford told BBC Breakfast the situation many now found themselves in ""reminds me of... when I was younger"" Manchester United star Marcus Rashford said receiving an honorary doctorate for his work to tackle child poverty was ""bittersweet"" as it came as the Â£20 top-up to universal credit ended. Accepting the award from the University of Manchester, he said removing the temporary increase ""could see child poverty rise to one-in-three children"". Mr Rashford called for an end towhat he said was a ""child hunger pandemic"". No 10 said the top-up was designed to help in the pandemic's toughest times. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer praised Mr Rashford's ""very, very powerful"" comments and said the government was now ""effectively turning on the poorest"". He promised a Labour government would retain the Â£20 uplift pending an overhaul of the benefits system, including the abolition of universal credit. ""It would stay, we wouldn't make the cut, we would then replace it with something better,"" he said. This video can not be played Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer: ""This is going to drive families and children into poverty"" Mr Rashford, 23, became the university's youngest recipient of an honorary award at a special ceremony at his club's Old Trafford stadium on Thursday. Speaking toBBC Breakfast, he said the situation many now found themselves in ""reminds me of... when I was younger"". The England forward added: ""You've got to decide between - are you going to eat or are you going to be warm in the house? ""These are decisions that you don't want people to go through, never mind children. ""And there's other stuff, the price of fuel and electricity and there's actually a shortage of food at the moment... as some of the food banks I work with are experiencing. ""So there's other things that people are worrying about and, if we can take one less stress off them, it's important."" GCSE pupils to study Rashford as campaigner How Rashford resolved to make change happen Universal credit: End of the Â£20 boost explained Mr Rashford said receiving the honorary doctorate was ""bittersweet"" since it came as ""millions of families across the UK lost a lifeline and a means of staying afloat"". The Â£20-a-week increase to universal credit, which was brought in to support those on low incomes during the pandemic,was withdrawn on Tuesday. Mr Rashford urged MPs to meet those who had been receiving the increased benefit. ""It's time that representatives got out into communities like mine,"" he said. ""It's time they saw first-hand the true measure of struggle. ""Covid-19 can no longer be used as an excuse."" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps told BBC Breakfast: ""If you want to carry on with that uplift you need to find Â£6bn from somewhere. ""Inevitably that means taxing people on their PAYE, maybe putting the cost of fuel up even more, even though it's at record levels or something else. ""Nothing is free when you're making these decisions."" Manchester United's chief operating officer Collette Roche said the club was ""so proud"" of Rashford In June 2020, Mr Rashfordcalled on the government to reverse a decisionnot to provide free school meal vouchers, saying that ""the system isn't built for families like mine to succeed"". He was later made an MBE for services to vulnerable children. In September, it was announcedpupils starting media studies GCSEswould study the impact of his campaigning. Author and broadcaster Lemn Sissay, the university's chancellor, said Mr Rashford being honoured was a ""highlight"" of his tenure. Allow Twitter content?

Manchester United's chief operating officer Collette Roche said the club was ""so proud"". ""He is a young man who embodies everything which this club stands for,"" she said. ""He is humble, he is passionate and he is driven to succeed in everything he does."" A Downing Street spokesperson said the universal credit top-up was always a ""temporary measure, designed to help claimants through the toughest stages of the pandemic"". ""But we are now seeing our economy starting to bounce back so our focus is rightly on helping people back into high-quality, well-paid jobs,"" they said.

Bottomley stands by MP pay rise comments,"Peter Bottomley says MPs are underpaid Tory MP Peter Bottomley has stood by comments he made about MPs struggling to get by and needing more pay. The MP faced an angry backlash over the claims, with Labour accusing him of being out of touch. But Sir Peter said the comments were part of abroader interview,externalin which he also expressed concern about universal credit cuts. The Â£20-a-week top up to the benefit officially ended on Wednesday, despite warnings about rising living costs. Universal credit: End of the Â£20 boost explained Universal credit reduction: 'I feel overwhelmed' Firms warn of price rises as energy bills soar Labour's shadow child poverty secretary Wes Streeting said he was ""genuinely infuriated"" by Sir Peter's comments. ""We are perfectly well paid, and unfortunately too many MPs on the Conservative side, at the same time as whingeing about very high - relatively high - levels of pay that MPs get in this country, at the same time they are clobbering people who are losing over Â£1,000 a year, which is 10% of their income in some cases,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. He added: ""This is my problem with the Tories - it's not that they're evil, bad people who go into work every day thinking 'How can we plunge more kids into poverty?' ""But, as Peter Bottomley's comments show, they just don't know what life is like for a hell of a lot of people in this country and they make policies that are actively hurting people who are going out, working hard, trying to make the best for their family and are really struggling."" But Sir Peter told the BBC he was not arguing for MP pay rises until after the next general election ""which is probably in three years' time"". He said he was trying to make the point that increasing MPs' salaries from the current average of just over Â£80,000 a year would make it easier to widen the pool of people interested in changing careers to become parliamentarians, without having to take a pay cut. ""If people can't switch across to being an MP, you're going to exclude a whole lot of people"" he said, such as headteachers and public sector executives. The 77-year-old Worthing West MP - the longest serving MP in the Commons - said he also shared concernsexpressed by other Tory MPsabout the government's benefit cuts although he is not arguing for the universal credit uplift to be made permanent. He ""would have agreed to increase universal credit temporarily"" as Chancellor Rishi Sunak did, he said, because it was a way to ""support those hurt most by the pandemic"". But he expressed concern at the speed with which it has been removed and said it would have been better to taper the extra money down to ""avoid cutting it off at a cliff-edge"". Concerns are growing over cost of living rises Conservative peer, Philippa Stroud, a former adviser to Iain Duncan Smith when he was work and pensions secretary, has threatened to force a vote on the universal credit cut in the House of Lords. And speaking on the BBC News Channel, Shadow Business Secretary, Ed Miliband said Labour was ""not giving up"" on attempts to reverse the reduction. ""It beggars belief"" he said ,that in the context of escalating energy prices and tax rises, ""the government is ploughing ahead"" with the cut to the benefit. People are facing a ""double whammy"" and the situation is going to be ""unbearable for so many families"" he added and targeting support through the social security system is the best way to help them.

US agrees to extend debt ceiling to avoid default,"Treasury Secretary Janet Yellen had warned that the US could fall into a recession if an agreement was not reached The US Senate has voted to temporarily raise the nation's debt limit, avoiding a historic default that experts say would have devastated the economy. Senators agreed to increase the limit by $480bn (Â£352bn), which will cover the US until early December. The bill was approved in a 50-48 vote, following weeks of partisan fighting. The breakthrough came less than two weeks before the US was set to be unable to borrow money or pay off loans for the first time ever. The bill now has to be approved by the House of Representatives, and will then be sent to President Joe Biden to be signed into law. The vote in the upper house of Congress came after Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell offered his support for a short-term extension. Senate Republicans have previously said that raising the debt limit is the ""sole responsibility"" of Democrats because they hold power in the White House and both chambers of Congress. They are frustrated by new spending proposals the Democrats are trying to push through without Republican support, and Mr McConnell tweeted last month that his party would ""not facilitate another reckless, partisan taxing and spending spree"". EXPLAINED:What's next for the US debt limit? Speaking after the vote, the Democrats' Senate Majority leader Chuck Schumer said Republicans had ""played a dangerous and risky partisan game"". ""What is needed now is a long-term solution so we don't go through this risky drama every few months,"" he added. But several senior Republicans attacked Mr McConnell's decision to strike a deal with Mr Schumer. South Carolina Senator Lindsey Graham called the move ""a complete capitulation"". US lawmakers will still have to address this issue near the new December deadline to avert a default. If the US defaults on debts, experts say it will severely hurt the country's credit rating, plunge the global financial system into turmoil, and possibly lead to a self-inflicted recession. Mitch McConnell said Republicans and Democrats negotiated through the night ""in good faith"" The US government spends more money than it collects in taxes, so it borrows to make up for the shortfall. Borrowing is done via the US Treasury, through the issuing of bonds. US government bonds are seen as among the world's safest and most reliable investments. In 1939, Congress established an aggregate limit or ""ceiling"" on how much debt the government could accumulate. The ceiling has been lifted on more than 100 occasions to allow the government to borrow more. Congress often acts on it in a bipartisan manner and it is rarely the subject of a political standoff. But some Republicans have voiced frustration about new Democrat spending proposals. Democrats have pointed out that raising the debt ceiling is about paying off existing obligations rather than paying for new ones, and that President Biden's policies have only contributed to 3% of existing debts.

"Pig labour shortage a human disaster, says NFU","Pig farmers are facing a ""human disaster"" due to a shortage of abattoir workers, the National Farmer's Union has said. Farmers are already having to destroy healthy pigs due to a backlog on farms, the union said. Time is running out for the UK pig sector, the National Pig Association (NPA) warned. But a government minister said businesses should pay higher wages and invest in skills. The industry blames the shortage of people to slaughter pigs in abattoirs on factors including Covid and Brexit. The chronic labour shortage has led to an estimated backlog of 85,000 pigs on farms, with an extra 15,000 being added per week, according to NPA figures. The industry association warned on Thursday,externalthat ""empty retail shelves and product shortages are becoming increasingly commonplace and Christmas specialities, such as pigs in blankets are already under threat"". ""The knock-on effect of the staff shortages is having a devastating effect on the country's pig farmers,"" the NPA said. Pig cull threat not being taken seriously by PM, says vet Abattoir labour shortage sees Yorkshire farmer kill piglets ""We are already seeing producers up and down the country getting out of pigs or cutting down on numbers because they cannot sustain these losses any longer,"" NPA chief executive Zoe Davies said. ""Without immediate government intervention, more producers will be pushed over the edge."" ""Sadly we are expecting a serious contraction of the UK pig industry,"" she added, saying mainly smaller independent farmers were affected. Around 600 pigs have already been killed to deal with overcrowding, and a mass cull is the next stage,the industry association has said. Speaking on BBC Question Time, National Farmers Union president Minette Batters said the UK is the ""first country in the world facing a cull of healthy livestock"". She said pigs were having to be destroyed using either a bolt gun or lethal injection, and added: ""As far as I'm concerned this is the start and it has to be resolved. ""This is livelihoods and this is people's businesses. ""This has been a human disaster for those pig farmers who are absolutely distraught."" She said that the government must address labour shortages unless we ""don't want a pig industry in this country"" which she argued would mean ""we will import pig meat that is produced to lower standards."" Ms Batters said Environment Secretary George Eustice and Cabinet Office minister Stephen Barclay were doing ""everything"" they can, but said she had not been able to see Home Secretary Priti Patel to discuss more migrant visas to address shortages. But Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said the government was working with the industry to find sustainable solutions and that issuing temporary visas was ""not enough"". He also said shortages were happening elsewhere in the world. Mr Zahawi added that Prime Minister Boris Johnson was ""right"" to challenge businesses to pay higher wages and invest in skills. But a top vet said on Wednesday that Mr Johnson wasnot taking the prospect of a national pig cull seriously.

Navy head to be new British armed forces chief,"Admiral Sir Tony Radakin will take over the position on 30 November The head of the navy has been selected as the next chief of Britain's armed forces - the first in 20 years. Boris Johnson has chosen Admiral Sir Tony Radakin, 55, to take over the position from General Sir Nick Carter. The prime minister said the new Chief of Defence Staff had proved himself as an ""outstanding military leader"". He is credited with ""overseeing a period of transformation"" in the navy, that has seen ""more ships deployed, for longer, all over the world"". Sir Tony will be responsible for leading and setting strategy for defence, as well as conducting operations and maintaining relationships with other military leaders. This year, he oversaw thedeployment of the HMS Queen Elizabeth aircraft carrierand a string of supporting vessels into the Pacific as part of a more aggressive posture towards China. Sir Tony was appointed First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff in June 2019 Mr Johnson said: ""Admiral Tony will lead the armed forces at a time of incredible change while upholding the values and standards that they are respected for around the world. ""I know he will bring drive and dedication to the job and I look forward to working with him."" The PM thanked Sir Nick, whose term had come to an end, for his ""decades of steadfast duty spent keeping the UK, its citizens and our allies safe"". He added: ""I have valued his wisdom and support through moments of national crisis, including the Covid pandemic. ""He leaves his post at the end of November with the armed forces in excellent health, ready to face whatever challenges tomorrow brings."" Jonathan Beale, defence correspondent The appointment of Admiral Sir Tony Radakin marks a shift. When Boris Johnson announced extra investment in defence last November, he promised to restore Britain's position as the ""foremost naval power in Europe"". The Integrated Defence Review also signalled a ""tilt"" to the Indo Pacific region in recognition of the rising power of China. Maritime power is seen as key to that. Hence the current deployment of the Aircraft Carrier HMS Queen Elizabeth to the region. Sir Tony was also involved in the early discussions that led to the Aukus agreement - the commitment by the US and UK to help Australia build a new fleet of nuclear powered submarines. UK defence is also investing heavily in its two new aircraft carriers; four new nuclear armed submarines and a fleet of new frigates. The fact that Sir Tony is politically and media savvy has helped. Some question his lack of operational experience - he's spent more time behind a desk than driving ships. But he has delivered for the navy, cutting the number of admirals and increasing the navy's days at sea. The prime minister believes he's the man who can help transform the armed forces, and just as important to Boris Johnson, help boost British defence exports. Sir Tony was appointed First Sea Lord and Chief of the Naval Staff in June 2019. Commissioned in 1990, his operational service has included responding to tanker disputes in Gulf, security duties in the Falklands, countering smuggling in Hong Kong and the Caribbean, and three command tours in Iraq. Sir Tony said he was ""humbled"" to be selected as the new head of the armed forces. ""It will be an immense privilege to lead our outstanding people who defend and protect the United Kingdom,"" he added.

Businesses likely to stay open over winter,"This video can not be played Care home visits will be easier, says first minister Christmas this year is likely to be more normal than in 2020, First Minister Mark Drakeford has said. He said if nothing unexpected happens Wales can look forward to a holiday season ""much more like the ones we are used to"". The Welsh government said that all businesses are likely to be able to stay open this winter. But it has drawn up a""Covid Urgent"" plan,externalif a new variant risks overwhelming the NHS. In a statement setting out Wales'autumn and winter plan,external, the government said such a scenario could be the emergence of a new, fast-spreading variant or if vaccine immunity levels fall, causing a rise in pandemic pressures. But it is more likely the country will slowly move out of the pandemic, where coronavirus becomes a seasonal illness, and that businesses can stay open. Mr Drakeford said Wales remains at alert level zero, with no changes likely in the next three weeks beyond those already announced. Figuring out the stats on coronavirus in Wales Q&A: What Covid rules will stay in Wales? Fines for faking Covid passes and tests in Wales At a briefing on Friday he also said it would now be easier to visit a loved one in a care home. It comes as Wales' case rates dip below 500 per 100,000 for the first time since mid-September. Mr Drakeford said in the most probable scenario ""we ought to be able to get through the autumn and the winter with restrictions at the sort of level we have at the moment. ""That would be very different to last Christmas, far more like the sort of Christmasses we were used to."" ""If nothing unexpected arises, and we've got to plan for the unexpected as well, then we can look forward to a Christmas much more like the ones that we are used to."" Wales went into lockdown days before Christmas last year, curtailing plans to allow more mixing over the period. Business owner Neil Collier said the news was ""reassuring"" Businesses said the news they would probably not be facing another winter lockdown was ""reassuring"". Neil Collier, owner of Colliers Photo Imaging in Uplands, Swansea, said he faced ""quite a hit"" last Christmas with ""panicked customers wondering if they were going to get their orders"". ""I think it's more security for business trade going into the winter months which is potentially our busiest period,"" he added. Last winter, Nicki Collier, who manages Bluebell Coffee and Kitchen in Tycoch, also Swansea, faced having to cancel bookings and process refunds. ""It's really reassuring to hear some good news finally. Shutting overnight last year was a really big shock,"" she said. ""Fingers crossed now this is good news for this Christmas."" Nikki Collier is optimistic about the months ahead Dr Richard Stanton, a virologist at Cardiff University, said the Welsh government should stick with current restrictions to ""keep a lid on transmission rates"" ahead of the winter. He said Covid-19 was now not the only concern, with other respiratory viruses such as flu and respiratory syncytial virus (RSV) - a common winter bug that can cause lung problems - likely to spread too. ""All those things will put pressure on the NHS and could result in further hospitalisations,"" he added.p What is a Covid pass and how do I get one? Clubbers and businesses torn over Wales Covid pass Should my child have a Covid vaccine? Mr Drakeford confirmed there would be no changes to the current regulations for the next three weeks, beyond those already announced. Rules around care home visits will be reduced, however. Mr Drakeford said providers can now allow visitors to take lateral flow tests at home and will no longer have to socially distance in a resident's room or in a designated visiting room. Restrictions around gifts, including food and drink, will also be eased. The first minister set outtwo planning scenarios for the pandemic over the winter.,external In the first, calledCovid Stable,external, Wales remains at alert level zero through the autumn and winter, with all businesses able to open. The second,Covid Urgent,external, is designed to deal with any sudden changes to the situation. If that happens previously drawn up ""alert levels"" - including lockdown at level four - could be used as an option of last resort. ""While we do not think measures under a Covid Urgent scenario will be necessary this autumn or winter, we cannot completely rule them out,"" the plan added. All businesses are likely to be able to stay open this winter, according to the Welsh government Mr Drakeford told journalists that, should demand for PCR tests outstrip the ability to provide them during the winter, then some less-vulnerable groups would be offered lateral flow strips in the first instance. He told journalists there was no plan to charge for PCR tests, but said after the winter Wales will begin to move into an era where ""mass testing will play a less important part in the way we manage the virus"". ""We will be reserving the tests for the purposes for which they are most important"", he added. Prior to the press conference the first minister said Wales was ""facing a challenging winter ahead - coronavirus hasn't gone away and flu is forecast to return this winter."" ""Vaccination is the best defence we have against coronavirus - the more people who are fully vaccinated, the better our chances of controlling the spread of this awful virus."" He encouraged everyone who was eligible ""to have their flu jab this year"". He said he believed Wales was now past the peak of the third wave, following a decline in cases over the last few days. Mr Drakeford asked everyone to continue to wash hands and meet outdoors to reduce the transmission of coronavirus In other measures to keep Wales safe,Covid passes in nightclubs and large events will be introducedfrom Monday, following a narrow victory for the Welsh government in a knife-edge Senedd vote this week. The public will be expected to show evidence of being fully vaccinated or having a recent negative Covid test. Mr Drakeford told the BBC's Dros Frecwast programme event organisers were responsible for checking people were carrying the correct Covid passes through a spot check system,as fines were being introduced for fake ones from Monday. ""When there are lots and lots of people trying to go in, for example, there will be no need to check each one,"" he said. At the briefing, he said he expected the introduction of Covid passes would be ""relatively smooth,"" but admitted it would not be without ""teething trouble"". ""I think that the system is easy to use,"" he added. Professor of epidemiology and biostatistics Mike Gravenor, of Swansea University Medical School, has been part of the team looking at the modelling of Covid-19 in Wales. He toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast:""We're still under a situation of uncertainty. A new variant is one factor and our understanding of how long immunity lasts for, in natural immunity and in vaccinated individuals."" All the indicators are pointing to an improving position with regards to Covid - case rates have been falling for the last nine days. The spike we saw in recent weeks was driven by high numbers of under-19s, especially secondary school-age children, testing positive, ahead of vaccinations being available for this age group. The character of this third wave spike was also influenced by record numbers of lateral flow tests coming back positive, so young people were being found to have Covid, even if not displaying symptoms. Because so many infections have involved young people, while many older and vulnerable people have been double-vaccinated, we have not seen anything like the Covid cases in hospital beds. Admissions have been higher in recent weeks than some early modelling predicted as likely, but numbers of patients with Covid are coming down. On Wednesday, there were 14% fewer Covid patients in hospital beds on average than two weeks ago. We have been seeing similar numbers in critical care for more than a month and those in ICU with non-Covid conditions outnumber Covid patients by more than two to one. But hospital managers will still be concerned that there are more than 420 Covid patients in beds across Wales and bed occupancy is at 90% in acute hospitals, with the winter to come. Sadly, there are still people dying of Covid and figures from the ONS this week showed 88 deaths in Wales in the latest week. But numbers are down considerably on earlier waves - and after a spike in September, they are back within the range expected by scientists.

'Being Scottish helped me win Nobel Prize',"Prof David MacMillan was awarded the prize for developing a new way of building molecules A Nobel Prize-winning scientist says his success is down to being Scottish and knowing how to get to a punchline. Prof David MacMillan, who is from North Lanarkshire, told the BBC that growing up in Scotland meant he learned how to convey ideas quickly. The professor said he was ""very, very proud"" of his ""working class"" upbringing in New Stevenston. He wasjointly awarded a Nobel Prize for chemistrywith German Scientist Benjamin List earlier this week. They were honoured by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which organises the awards, after developing a new way of building molecules. Prof MacMillan, of Princeton University in the United States, said the concept has been used to make medicines faster and has helped with the development of drugs for Alzheimer's, cancer and heart disease. Two women share chemistry Nobel in historic win Climate science breakthroughs win physics Nobel Sense of touch and heat research wins Nobel Prize He grew up in New Stevenston, near Bellshill, and gained his undergraduate degree in chemistry at the University of Glasgow before moving to the US for postgraduate studies. The scientist said his Scottish upbringing helped him learn how to tell a story and explain concepts quickly. ""Growing up in Scotland, you learn how to talk and you learn how to tell a joke and you can get to a punchline,"" he said. ""You can convey ideas quickly from growing up in Scotland - you're good at it. ""So we were able to convey to people that this was actually a pretty interesting and valuable concept that people could use in science and it certainly helped my career and certainly helped the science move forward, but it wouldn't have happened if I was not Scottish."" Prof MacMillan moved to the United States after completing his undergraduate studies at the University of Glasgow Prof MacMillan attended New Stevenston Primary School and Bellshill Academy and he praised the ""brilliant"" education he received. He said: ""I am one of those people who's incredibly lucky to have come through that system."" The scientist gained his undergraduate degree in chemistry at the University of Glasgow in 1991, before being awarded a PhD in organic chemistry at the University of California, Irvine, in 1996. He studied at Harvard University before beginning his career at the University of California, Berkeley, moving to Caltech and then Princeton in 2006. Asked to explain his discovery in layman's terms, he told BBCRadio Good Morning Scotland programme: ""If you look around yourself right now, in the studio or at home, everything around you, stuff, is all made by chemical reactions, and how those chemical reactions work is based on this thing called catalysis. ""We invented these new types of catalysis that allowed you to do things you couldn't do before, to make new materials, new stuff around you. ""But probably the most important thing immediately is how to make medicines even faster so that's been a great thing."" The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said on Wednesday: ""Building molecules is a difficult art. Benjamin List and David MacMillan are awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2021 for their development of a precise new tool for molecular construction: organocatalysis. ""This has had a great impact on pharmaceutical research, and has made chemistry greener."" Prof List and Prof MacMillan, who are both 53, will share the prize money of 10 million krona (Â£842,611).

Schools warned about hoax Covid vaccine letters,"The PHA has told schools the email contains ""a number of important inaccuracies"" about the vaccine. The Public Health Agency (PHA) has warned post primary schools in Northern Ireland about hoax Covid vaccine consent letters. Some schools have received emails claiming to come from the NHS, which contain a ""consent checklist"" for vaccination. The email asks them to share the checklist with parents and pupils. But the PHA said ""the false email and 'consent form' content contains a number of important inaccuracies"". It should ""not be forwarded to parents,"" the PHA said. BBC News NI has been contacted by some principals in Northern Ireland whose schools have received the hoax consent forms. They are presented as a form with information to be sent to parents ahead of pupils being given Covid vaccinations. Below an ""NHS Vaccines"" logo, the consent form includes claims such as the vaccine being a risk for ""strokes, blindness, deafness, clotting, miscarriages, anaphylaxis and cardiovascular disorders"". About 100,000 12 to 15 year olds in Northern Ireland will be offered a jab by the start of December As a result, the PHA has written to schools in Northern Ireland warning them that the material is false. ""Materials include a branded 'consent form' has the look and feel of authoritative NHS communications using a made up NHS vaccines logo,"" the PHA letter said. The agency said that some schools elsewhere in the UKhad mistakenly circulated the hoax checklist to parents. ""Please only forward to parents materials that have come from the PHA or your own Trust school nursing teams,"" the PHA told principals. The agency has published guidance on theimminent rollout of the vaccine to 12 to 15 year oldsin Northern Ireland. Single Covid jab recommended for 12 to 15-year-olds What difference will jabbing young teens make? Will children's Covid jabs be compulsory? About 100,000 children and young people in Northern Ireland will be offered a jab by the start of December. The PHA said that information packs for children and parents would ""be delivered to schools in the second to third week of October to make sure that individuals, or those giving consent on their behalf, have enough information to enable them to make a decision before they give consent"". ""In Northern Ireland, Covid-19 vaccine for school children is being offered at school by the usual Trust school health nursing arrangements,"" the PHA letter to principals said. ""Schools will be receiving an information pack with more details from the PHA via the Education Authority school systems very shortly.""

NatWest faces fine over money laundering failings,"Chief executive Alison Rose said NatWest took financial crime extremely seriously NatWest bank has pleaded guilty to failing to prevent alleged money laundering of nearly Â£400m by one customer. NatWest said ""we deeply regret"" failing to ""adequately monitor and therefore prevent money laundering by one of our customers between 2012 and 2016"". The state-backed bank, formerly Royal Bank of Scotland, is the first British lender to admit such an offence. Lawyers told a court hearing that NatWest faces a large fine. The case was brought by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) which alleged the bank failed to monitor suspect activity by a client that deposited about Â£365m in its accounts over five years, of which Â£264m was in cash. The criminal action, first announced by the FCA in March, was the first against a bank under a 2007 money laundering law. The FCA said NatWest failed to adhere to the requirements of anti-money laundering legislation in relation to Fowler Oldfield Ltd's account between 7 November 2013 and 23 June 2016. Fowler Oldfield was a century-old jeweller based in Bradford, and was shut down following a police raid in 2016. FCA prosecutor Clare Montgomery QC told Westminster magistrates that when Fowler Oldfield was taken on as a client by NatWest, its predicted turnover was said to be Â£15m per annum. However, it deposited Â£365m over the space of almost five years. She said: ""It was agreed that the bank would not handle cash deposits. However, it deposited Â£365m, with around Â£264m in cash."" She said that at its height, Fowler Oldfield deposited up to Â£1.8m a day. The court was told the ""likely sentence is a very large fine"". NatWest remains 55% taxpayer-owned after receiving a Â£45bn bailout at the height of the 2008 financial crisis. Chief executive Alison Rose said: ""NatWest has a vital part to play in detecting and preventing financial crime and we take extremely seriously our responsibility to prevent money laundering by third parties. ""In the years since this case, we have invested significant resources and continue to enhance our efforts to effectively combat financial crime."" Jonathan Fisher, a senior lawyer at Bright Line Law specialising in money laundering cases, said the FCA had claimed ""a big scalp"". ""The message sent to financial institutions is clear. If there are failings in your money laundering systems, criminal prosecution may follow. NatWest was sensible to take the hit, and it must now move on.""

Abdulrazak Gurnah wins Nobel Prize for Literature,"This video can not be played ""Come on, get out of here! Leave me alone"" â why Abdulrazak Gurnah didn't believe the news at first Tanzanian novelist Abdulrazak Gurnah has said he was ""surprised and humbled"" to be awarded the 2021 Nobel Prize for Literature. The Swedish Academy praised Gurnah for his ""uncompromising and compassionate penetration of the effects of colonialism"". The prize is awarded by the Swedish Academy and is worth 10 million Swedish crowns ($1.14m / Â£840,000). Gurnah, 73, is the author of 10 novels, including Paradise and Desertion. He said how grateful he was to the academy, adding: ""It's just great - its just a big prize, and such a huge list of wonderful writers - I am still taking it in. ""It was such a complete surprise that I really had to wait until I heard it announced before I could believe it."" Paradise, published in 1994, told the story of a boy growing up in Tanzania in the early 20th Century and was nominated for the Booker Prize, marking his breakthrough as a novelist. ""Abdulrazak Gurnah's dedication to truth and his aversion to simplification are striking,"" the Nobel Committee for Literature said in a statement. ""His novels recoil from stereotypical descriptions and open our gaze to a culturally diversified East Africa unfamiliar to many in other parts of the world."" ""[His] characters find themselves in a hiatus between cultures and continents, between a life that was and a life emerging; it is an insecure state that can never be resolved."" Books written by Gurnah were displayed as the Academy announced him as the winner in Stockholm Born in Zanzibar in 1948, Gurnah arrived in England as a refugee in the late 1960s. He was Professor of English and Postcolonial Literatures at the University of Kent, Canterbury, until his recent retirement. Gurnah is the first black African author to have won the award since Wole Soyinka in 1986. He said his award would mean issues such as the refugee crisis and colonialism, which he has experienced, will be ""discussed"". ""These are things that are with us every day. People are dying, people are being hurt around the world - we must deal with these issues in the most kind way,"" he said. ""I came to England when these words, such as asylum-seeker, were not quite the same - more people are struggling and running from terror states. ""The world is much more violent than it was in the 1960s, so there is now greater pressure on the countries that are safe, they inevitably draw more people."" In an interview in 2016,,externalwhen asked if he would call himself an ""author of postcolonial and/or world literature"", Gurnah replied: ""I would not use any of those words. I wouldn't call myself a something writer of any kind. ""In fact, I am not sure that I would call myself anything apart from my name. I guess, if somebody challenges me, that would be another way of saying, 'Are you a... one of these...?' I would probably say 'no'. Precisely, I don't want that part of me having a reductive name."" The Nobel Prizes, which have been awarded since 1901, recognise achievement in literature, science, peace and latterly economics. Past winners have included novelists such as Ernest Hemingway, Gabriel Garcia Marquez and Toni Morrison, poets such as Pablo Neruda, Joseph Brodsky and Rabindranath Tagore, and playwrights including Harold Pinter and Eugene O'Neill.

Bottomley stands by MP pay rise commentsThe Conservative MP has been accused of being out of touch with hard-pressed families.UK Politics,"Peter Bottomley says MPs are underpaid Tory MP Peter Bottomley has stood by comments he made about MPs struggling to get by and needing more pay. The MP faced an angry backlash over the claims, with Labour accusing him of being out of touch. But Sir Peter said the comments were part of abroader interview,externalin which he also expressed concern about universal credit cuts. The Â£20-a-week top up to the benefit officially ended on Wednesday, despite warnings about rising living costs. Universal credit: End of the Â£20 boost explained Universal credit reduction: 'I feel overwhelmed' Firms warn of price rises as energy bills soar Labour's shadow child poverty secretary Wes Streeting said he was ""genuinely infuriated"" by Sir Peter's comments. ""We are perfectly well paid, and unfortunately too many MPs on the Conservative side, at the same time as whingeing about very high - relatively high - levels of pay that MPs get in this country, at the same time they are clobbering people who are losing over Â£1,000 a year, which is 10% of their income in some cases,"" he told BBC Radio 5 Live. He added: ""This is my problem with the Tories - it's not that they're evil, bad people who go into work every day thinking 'How can we plunge more kids into poverty?' ""But, as Peter Bottomley's comments show, they just don't know what life is like for a hell of a lot of people in this country and they make policies that are actively hurting people who are going out, working hard, trying to make the best for their family and are really struggling."" But Sir Peter told the BBC he was not arguing for MP pay rises until after the next general election ""which is probably in three years' time"". He said he was trying to make the point that increasing MPs' salaries from the current average of just over Â£80,000 a year would make it easier to widen the pool of people interested in changing careers to become parliamentarians, without having to take a pay cut. ""If people can't switch across to being an MP, you're going to exclude a whole lot of people"" he said, such as headteachers and public sector executives. The 77-year-old Worthing West MP - the longest serving MP in the Commons - said he also shared concernsexpressed by other Tory MPsabout the government's benefit cuts although he is not arguing for the universal credit uplift to be made permanent. He ""would have agreed to increase universal credit temporarily"" as Chancellor Rishi Sunak did, he said, because it was a way to ""support those hurt most by the pandemic"". But he expressed concern at the speed with which it has been removed and said it would have been better to taper the extra money down to ""avoid cutting it off at a cliff-edge"". Concerns are growing over cost of living rises Conservative peer, Philippa Stroud, a former adviser to Iain Duncan Smith when he was work and pensions secretary, has threatened to force a vote on the universal credit cut in the House of Lords. And speaking on the BBC News Channel, Shadow Business Secretary, Ed Miliband said Labour was ""not giving up"" on attempts to reverse the reduction. ""It beggars belief"" he said ,that in the context of escalating energy prices and tax rises, ""the government is ploughing ahead"" with the cut to the benefit. People are facing a ""double whammy"" and the situation is going to be ""unbearable for so many families"" he added and targeting support through the social security system is the best way to help them.

More than a million more face fuel poverty,"More than a million extra British households won't be able to afford to heat and power their homes next spring, according to a charity. Energy bills are expected to rise again in April to reflect the rising wholesale price of gas. National Energy Action says 1.2 million to 1.5 million additional households will be plunged into fuel poverty. Households that spend a high proportion of their income on energy bills are considered to be in fuel poverty. At the start of October the energy price cap, which limits the impact of rising energy prices on households in England, Scotland and Wales, was raised to take the sharply rising wholesale gas price into account. But Ofgem, the energy regulator, said the price cap would have to rise again next year if wholesale gas prices continue to go up. Analysts said this could mean a typical customer paying between Â£400 and Â£600 more per year. Households in Northern Ireland have also seen a recent sharp rise in their bills, but they aren't protected by the energy price cap for Great Britain. If you feel powerless against international business and politics when watching your domestic energy bill go up, you are in good company. Normally, customers are urged to get active, search and switch to save money - but not now. Until recently, the energy price cap was a backstop, protecting the vulnerable. Now it is the most competitive tariff available. The cap is shielding households from the wild fluctuation in prices seen on the wholesale markets, but that is only a crumb of comfort when bills and prices across the board are still expected to see a sharp increase. So for now, experts simply advise customers to find ways to save energy, brace themselves and budget for bigger bills. Wrap up for a financial chill that could last longer than the winter. National Energy Action (NEA) said this month's price rises had already pushed half a million more households into fuel poverty. ""It's building into a brutal and bleak winter for millions. If the price cap goes up by Â£400 to Â£600 a year it could plunge 1.2 to 1.5 million households into fuel poverty, leaving almost 5.5 million households struggling to keep their homes warm and safe,"" said NEA chief executive Adam Scorer. NEA is calling for more support to be put in place for low income households. Ofgem, the energy regulator, said it expected prices would rise further in April. Its chief executive Jonathan Brearley said the energy cap was ""designed to reflect fair costs and therefore will need to adjust over time"". Natural gas prices are at record highs as economies around the world begin to recover from the Covid crisis. As a result, firms that supply gas to householders are running into trouble because they have agreed to sell energy at less than the price it now costs them to buy it. Even with the raising of the cap this month Mr Brearley said more energy firms could run into difficulties. ""Given the continued volatility in the market, it is likely more suppliers will exit the market,"" he told an energy conference on Thursday. Nine firms have already gone out of business, forcing 1.7 million customers to move to new suppliers. Those households have already seen annual bill increases of hundreds of pounds, since new providers aren't able to match lower-rate fixed deals that were on offer when gas prices were lower. What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? Energy price cap: Why are fuel bills rising? UK gas prices fall from record high after Russia steps in Firms warn of price rises as energy costs soar Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, who was also attending the conference, said the right response to rising gas prices was to renew the UK's commitment to renewable energy. The government recently pledged to shift electricity generation away from fossil fuels entirely by 2035. ""The UK so far, as many of you know, has made great progress in diversifying our energy mix. But we are still very dependent, perhaps too dependent, on fossil fuels and their volatile prices,"" he said. Decarbonising heating and power would mean lower prices he said. ""Our homes and businesses will be powered by affordable, clean and secure electricity generated here in the UK, for people in the UK,"" Mr Kwarteng said. However, customers will question whether the cost of the making the transition to lower carbon energy could push bills higher in the short term. The next revision to the energy price cap will be decided by Ofgem in February but will come into force in April. Analysts Cornwall Insight said that the cap could go up by Â£400 meaning that a household with typical energy use would pay around Â£1,660 a year. However the Energy Shop - a price comparison site - warned people to prepare themselves for even greater increases in household bills. It said that the next increase in the price cap could be Â£500 or even higher. Founder Joe Malinowski warned: ""If things don't settle down soon, increases of Â£600, Â£700 or even Â£800 cannot be ruled out."" Businesses are also feeling the impact of rising energy costs. Firms are warning that could lead tohigher prices for their goodsas increases are passed on to consumers. Richard Walker, managing director of supermarket chain Iceland, said steep rises in energy bills and other costs meant price rises were now ""inevitable"". ""The UK supermarket industry is one of the most competitive in the world,"" he told the BBC. ""Our margins are very tight and we're not an endless sponge that can just absorb all of these different cost increases."" Mark Nicholson and his business partner set up their firm Harvey George Furniture four years ago in Hull. Today they employ about 30 people making bespoke bathroom and bedroom furniture. The past 18 months have been so good that they've moved premises to expand - and invested about Â£500,000 in new technology and machinery to keep up with demand. ""It's a gas guzzler - unfortunately for us it's a big gas guzzler,"" he says of their new painting machine, which is piped into the mains and is able to produce colourful furniture much faster. ""Any business, it's about cost and quite a big component for us is energy, so it's quite a scary thought. Our last bill was Â£8,000 - it was a shock. ""We'll keep going. But we could just do with some stability on our costs. It feels like everything - rates, recruitment, materials, shipping - now energy... feels very up and down."" The energy price cap sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff. That includes the fixed daily amount customers pay, plus the price per unit they pay for electricity and gas. When the cap was increased on 1 October, about 15 million households faced a 12% rise in energy bills, the biggest jump, to the highest amount, seen since the backstop was introduced in January 2019. Those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, saw an increase of Â£139 - from Â£1,138 to Â£1,277 a year. Prepayment meter customers with average energy use saw a Â£153 increase. That is a far cry from a year previously when on 1 October 2020, the energy price cap was cut by Â£84, to Â£1,042.

Fines for faking Covid passes and tests in Wales,"Anyone using a fake pass or test result will be fined, says the Welsh government Anyone caught using a fake Covid pass or lateral flow test result in Wales will be fined from Monday, the Welsh government has confirmed. Following a Senedd vote,anyone attending a nightclub or large-scale event must carry a Covid pass. Proof of being double-vaccinated or a negative lateral flow test within the last 48 hours will be needed to download the NHS Covid pass. It will be an offence to fake a test result or use a counterfeit pass. What is a Covid pass and how do I get one? Vaccine passports in Wales: Are you for or against? Clubbers and businesses torn over Wales Covid pass The fixed penalty notice can be reduced to Â£30 if paid within 14 days. However, if it is not a first offence then the fine will double. The fine will double if the person caught with a fake pass is not a first-time offender There is no charge to obtain a Covid pass or a lateral flow test - but some people in Wales have been caught out by scams. The Welsh government warned people to be on the look out for scams related to Covid passes in a tweet last month. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Alison Farrar, lead officer for Trading Standards Wales, toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast: ""Scammers are so quick these days at getting onto anything that sounds legitimate.

Ms Farrar said people had already been scammed into paying for a pass after receiving a text or email from a scammer. ""The warning signs are when they look like they're going to start asking you for your card details, even if they claim they're not going to take any money. Why would they need your banking details otherwise?"" She urged people to ""think it through properly"" before clicking links and responding to ""urgent"" requests received from unknown senders.

Twitch blames server error for massive data leak,"Livestreaming site Twitch says an ""error"" caused the unprecedented leak that posted vast amounts of sensitive data online this week. The data appeared to include Twitch's internal code and documents, as well as the payments made to thousands of top streamers. Twitch now says the breach was caused by a ""server configuration change"" that ""exposed"" some data. But it has not confirmed if all the data posted online is genuine. The Amazon-owned company said the breach had involved ""a Twitch server configuration change that was subsequently accessed by a malicious third party"". ""As the investigation is ongoing, we are still in the process of understanding the impact in detail,"" it said. But as Twitch streamers and viewers alike scrambled to change passwords, the company also said it: had ""no indication"" login details were compromised ""at this time"" did not store users' credit-card information, so that kind of financial information could not have been exposed was resetting all users' stream keys - the unique code used by streaming software to broadcast to the right Twitch account Twitch's short statement shows the company is in full crisis mode. Information-technology (IT) teams and security experts are still trying to understand just how bad the data leak is. The explanation for the hack is there was some sort of human error with a ""server configuration"". In other words, someone set up the computers that store Twitch's private data incorrectly, making it findable and downloadable to hackers. What the company has not said is when this mistake was made. Some of the stolen data goes back three years, so there is a chance the servers could have been sitting ducks for some time - or the mistake could have left the door open for only a few days or weeks. Hackers are always searching and scanning for open databases online - or it is even possible someone may have tipped off hackers about the internal IT blunder. But making these sorts of mistakes is costly - particularly when you are a target as big as Twitch. Wednesday's leak took the form of a torrent file posted to online forums by an anonymous user. Its file structure contains folders labelled as containing payout information, business documents, under-the-hood software files and code, and even details of unreleased projects. And the payouts folder contains what appear to be records of payments made to thousands of the biggest streamers on the platform over two years - showing many of the biggest brands are earning millions of dollars. TikTok and Twitch face fines under new Ofcom rules Twitch announces new tools to fight harassment Several streamers told BBC Newsthe payment data was accurate for their own earnings. And that poses problems for the company. ""A lot more damage is now in store for Twitch,"" Candid Wuest from cyber-security company Acronis, said. ""The breach is already harming Twitch on all the fronts that count."" The leaked data ""could contain nearly the full digital footprint of Twitch, making it one of the most severe data breaches of late"", he said. ""Releasing payout reports for streaming clients will not make the influencers happy either,"" Mr Wuest added. The download released online is also labelled ""part one"" - suggesting there may be more material yet to be posted to the internet.

Amber list scrapped,"New simplified travel rules have come into force in the UK, with the traffic light system replaced by a single red list. Most fully vaccinated travellers arriving from non-red list countries will no longer have to take a test before setting off for the UK. Airlines UK said it would make travelling abroad easier and cheaper. But those coming from red list destinations must still pay to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days. Under the changes, which came into force at 04:00 BST, the green and amber lists have been scrapped. Testing rules are also being eased for people travelling from non-red list destinations who have been vaccinated in the UK, the EU, the US, or any of 18 other recognised countries. Anyone under 18 who is resident in those countries can also travel to the UK without testing. These groups were already able to avoid self-isolating on their arrival back in the UK. How are the green and amber lists changing on Monday? Plan A or Plan B - what could happen this winter? Covid map: Where are cases the highest? All travellers - except children under five years old - will still have to pay for a PCR test two days after arrival. People who are not fully vaccinated will need a pre-departure test and a PCR test on days two and eight after they return, and must self-isolate for 10 days at home. And those arriving from red list countries, including Brazil, Mexico, the Philippines and South Africa, must quarantine for 10 days in a government-approved hotel, at a cost of Â£2,285 for one adult. Only UK or Irish nationals, or UK residents, are allowed to enter the UK if they have been in a red country in the previous 10 days. The red list is due to be updated later this week. The government may also announce additions to the list of countries whose vaccination certificates are recognised by the UK. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said: ""We are accelerating towards a future where travel continues to reopen safely and remains open for good, and today's rule changes are good news for families, businesses and the travel sector. ""Our priority remains to protect public health but, with more than eight in 10 people now fully vaccinated, we are able to take these steps to lower the cost of testing and help the sector to continue in its recovery."" There was a surge in holiday bookings after the government announced the changes last month andthe travel sector has welcomed the move. The industry previously criticised the government for being too slow to ease and simplify rules on testing and quarantine. From later in October, the government has said fully vaccinated people coming to England will no longer have to take a PCR test two days after arrival and can take a cheaper lateral flow test instead. No date has been set for this change but ministers are aiming to have it in place for the half-term school break. So far, no other UK nation has followed suit. Scotland has said it will ""align with the UK post-arrival testing regime"" but has not announced further details. The Welsh government said it had ""concerns"" about easing its testing regime. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, which represents UK carriers, said: ""Things are moving in the right direction and the removal of these restrictions will make it easier and cheaper for people to travel."" However, he said the UK remained ""an outlier on arrivals testing for vaccinated passengers"". Airlines UK hopes to see more countries removed from the red list at the next update and further mutual recognition of vaccine status for those jabbed in other countries, he added. Willie Walsh, head of industry body the International Air Transport Association, welcomed the change as a ""positive step"", saying the government's testing and quarantine restrictions had been both unscientific and costly. ""People have been led to believe that the risk is people flying into the country. The risk was inside the country,"" he said. Alan French, chief executive at Thomas Cook, said more options would now be available for travellers. ""They will be more confident if they book the holiday, they can travel safely there and be able to return in a transparent way, which is something they've not been able to do,"" he said. Mr French said since the government announced the changes, three weeks ago, his company had seen bookings more than double. The UK recorded 30,439 cases on Sunday, with the total number of cases in the past seven days up one per cent on the previous week. However, the number of Covid deaths and hospital admissions are falling, with 43 deaths within 28 days of a positive test reported on Sunday.

Nightclubs to reopen as social distancing scrappedThe legal requirement for social distancing in hospitality will be lifted from 31 October.,"Nightclubs have been closed in Northern Ireland since March 2021 The legal requirement for social distancing in bars and restaurants is to be removed. Nightclubs are also to be allowed to reopen, meaning legal restrictions on dancing in venues will be scrapped. Restrictions will be lifted from 31 October. A number of mitigations have been agreed and it is thought businesses will be asked to check for vaccine certificates, but this will not be a legal requirement. Ministers have also agreed to retain the mandatory wearing of face coverings in certain settings. It is understood ministers were advised that moving legal regulations on face coverings into guidance would lead to a 30% decline in their use. The industry had argued that social distancing requirements were damaging trade. The new rules mean people will be able to move around pubs and restaurants and to eat and drink while standing up. Changes were also announced tothe UK travel red list, which has been cut from 54 countriesto seven. Michelle O'Neill and Paul Givan announced the rule changes at Stormont First Minister Paul Givan welcomed the easing of restrictions, particularly for the the hospitality sector, which he said had been hit hard during the pandemic. ""I'm pleased that at the end of this month they will be able to operate in a much more sustainable and viable way,"" he said. Mr Givan said the sector benefitted from ""a high level of adherence"" to coronavirus restrictions, adding that he believed this would continue. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she was pleased progress had been made at Thursday's executive meeting, but that people should remain cautious. ""We're in for an uncertain period ahead and we have to work our way through that as best we can,"" she said. Ms O'Neill said continuing increasing vaccination rates would also be a ""crucially important"" part of the executive's winter planning. Under existing rules, social distancing of at least 1m (3ft) remains a legal requirement in pubs, bars and restaurants in Northern Ireland. From Thursday 14 October the restrictions on the number of people allowed to meet inside a home is to be increased from 15 from four households to 30 from an unlimited number of households. From that date, people attending performances at indoor venues will not have to be seated during the performance. The executive is now moving to unlock the final stage of pandemic recovery. Nightclubs will finally get to reopen on Halloween and social distancing - something we've lived with as the norm for the past 18 months - will be scrapped. It's perhaps no surprise given how that's already the case in Great Britain and the rules south of the Irish border will end this month too. But not everything is changing - face coverings will remain - a sign that for some, caution is still needed with Covid. The executive has also warned that if things begin to go in the wrong direction again, vaccine passports could then be deployed. The Department of Health will now progress work on the system after agreement with Executive Office officials - but the onus on hospitality businesses will be to prove that a mandatory scheme isn't needed. John Leighton, owner of Bennigan's Bar, Londonderry, said easing restrictions for hospitality was fantastic news, which the sector ""had been waiting on for some time"". He said it had been a challenging and stressful time for the sector and that the timing to ease restrictions on 31 October was particularly good for Derry's annual Halloween festival. ""It means we can get back to enjoying ourselves and not having so many things to think about,"" he said. ""We can get back to a bit more normality."" Janice Gault from the Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said the restrictions which are being removed had presented ""significant challenges"" for businesses which were trying to become fully operational again. She said: ""The industry has traded well to date and our primary focus remains the health and well-being of our staff and customers. ""Winter trade, in a viable manner within a sustainable framework and without further lockdown, is our aim."" In September, the executive agreed toend social distancing restrictionsfor shops, theatres and a number of other indoor settings. They asked some sectors to put in place mitigations including proof of double vaccination or a negative lateral flow test. But this is advice and is not legally enforceable. Robin Swann is frustrated over plans to introduce a vaccine passport Last week,Health Minister Robin Swann warnedthat a delay by the executive in agreeing a vaccine passport policy had limited options for easing more restrictions. The Department of Health will now progress work to develop the digital scheme, but ministers will have to decide whether to deploy it. Ms O'Neill said she did not want things to reach that point and hoped businesses would voluntarily comply with executive advice and demonstrate they could work safely. Ministers also discusseda bid from Communities Minister Deirdre Hargeyfor Â£55m in funding to mitigate the end of a Â£20 weekly uplift for people claiming universal credit. Stormont received an extra Â£180m from the Treasury in September and that money has yet to be distributed. The expectation was that most if not all of that money would go on health spending. Mr Givan and Ms O'Neill made clear that Stormont would face major difficulties - both financially and logistically - of stepping in to top up payments Mr Givan said the Executive had to be ""honest"" with the public about the financial position. ""Now is not the time to be removing this uplift,"" he said. ""That is happening though this week and the ability, even if the executive had the funding, to do this [top up the payments] isn't there because we don't have the systems, this is administered directly through the Department for Work and Pensions in London. ""So we don't have the system. And the ability to finance it - we have to be honest with the public.""

Saudi-led takeover of Newcastle completedA Â£300m Saudi Arabian-backed takeover of Premier League club Newcastle United is completed.,"This video can not be played Newcastle co-owner Amanda Staveley speaks to BBC Sports Editor Dan Roan on day Saudi takeover was completed A Saudi Arabian-backed Â£305m takeover of Newcastle United has been completed. The Premier League has approved the takeover after receiving ""legally binding assurances"" that the Saudi state would not control the club. Instead the Public Investment Fund (PIF), which will provide 80% of funds for the deal, is seen as separate to the state. This is despite the Crown Prince of Saudi Arabia, Mohammed bin Salman, being listed as chair of PIF. The sale went through after the deal passed the Premier League owners' and directors' test. The takeover brings to an end Mike Ashley's 14-year spell as Newcastle United owner. Fans gathered outside Newcastle's St James' Park stadium on Thursday to celebrate the takeover being approved. PIF have assets of Â£250bn, making Newcastle one of the richest clubs in the world. Financier Amanda Staveley, who fronted the consortium, said the new owners are making a ""long-term investment"" to ensure Newcastle are ""regularly competing for major trophies"". Newcastle's last major domestic trophy was the 1955 FA Cup. Football Daily: New era for Newcastle United What's next for Newcastle after Â£305m takeover? Newcastle's 14 years of lost hope under Ashley This video can not be played Alan Shearer speaks to BBC Breakfast about Newcastle United takeover A Premier League statement said: ""The Premier League, Newcastle United Football Club and St James Holdings Limited have today settled the dispute over the takeover of the club by the consortium of PIF, PCP Capital Partners and RB Sports & Media. ""The legal disputes concerned which entities would own and/or have the ability to control the club following the takeover. All parties have agreed the settlement is necessary to end the long uncertainty for fans over the club's ownership. ""The Premier League has now received legally binding assurances that the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia will not control Newcastle United Football Club. ""All parties are pleased to have concluded this process which gives certainty and clarity to Newcastle United Football Club and their fans."" A deal was initially agreed in April 2020, but the buyers walked away four months later when the Premier League offered arbitration to settle a disagreement on who would control the club. It is believed that a resolution came after Saudi Arabia settled an alleged piracy dispute with Qatar-based broadcaster beIN Sports, which own rights to show Premier League matches in the Middle East. But sources have told BBC Sport that an agreement between the Premier League and the consortium was reached prior to news emerging on Wednesday that the piracy dispute had been resolved. The Saudi Arabian state has been accused of human rights abuses, but with the majority owner PIF deemed a separate entity, that, and any piracy issues, were no longer an impediment to the takeover, in the Premier League's view. Western intelligence agencies believe the crown prince ordered the murder of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in 2018 - which he denies. PCP Capital chief executive Amanda Staveley will take a seat on Newcastle's board, while Yasir Al-Rumayyan, the governor of PIF, will act as the club's non-executive chairman. Staveley told BBC sports editor Dan Roan that PCP Capital took concerns over Saudi Arabia's human rights record ""very seriously"" but reiterated that their partner ""is not that Saudi state, it's PIF"". When asked if this was a case of 'sportswashing' by Saudi Arabia, she said: ""No, not at all, this is very much about the PIF's investment into a fantastic football team and we look forward to growing the club.""

Saudi Arabia has been accused of human rights abuses and women's rights campaigners have been imprisoned, despite some reform under Mohammed bin Salman, such as an end to the ban on women driving. Homosexuality is outlawed in the countryand the International Lesbian, Gay, Bisexual, Trans and Intersex Association says the death penalty is the legally prescribed punishment for same-sex sexual acts in Saudi Arabia. Amnesty International UK said the takeover is ""an extremely bitter blow for human rights defenders"". ""We can understand that this will be seen as a great day by many Newcastle United fans,"" said chief executive Sacha Deshmukh. ""But it's also a very worrying day for anyone who cares about the ownership of English football clubs and whether these great clubs are being used to sportswash human rights abuse."" Deshmukh reiterated Amnesty International's call for the Premier League to ""change their owners' and directors' test to address human rights issues"". Khashoggi's fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, previously urged the Premier League not to allow the move to go through, citing the involvement of the crown prince.

He first put the club up for sale in September 2008 amid a series of protests from fans following the resignation of popular manager Kevin Keegan. Newcastle were relegated from the Premier League that season and again in 2015-16, although returned to the top flight at the first opportunity both times by winning the Championship. The Magpies' highest Premier League finish during Ashley's ownership was fifth in 2011-12 under Alan Pardew. Ashley put Newcastle up for sale again in October 2017. The club are 19th and winless after seven games this season, with boss Steve Bruce under pressure - a Newcastle United Supporters' Trust (NUST) survey said this week 94% of fans want Bruce to leave. The same survey said 93.8% of its members are in favour of the takeover and NUST said in a statement that the sale brought ""the first real hope"" of success to the club ""for many years"".

Firms warn of price rises as energy costs soar,"High energy costs are forcing manufacturers to warn of higher prices for their goods as they pass on increases to consumers. Iceland boss Richard Walker said higher energy bills and other costs meant price rises were now ""inevitable"". The warning came as analysts predicted that household energy bills could rise by hundreds of pounds next year. They said the energy price cap, which protects domestic consumers, could soar by Â£400 in the spring. Cornwall Insight forecasts that the energy price cap will rise to about Â£1,660 by next summer. That is about 30% higher than the record Â£1,277 level for the cap set for winter 2021-22, which began at the start of October. ""With wholesale gas and electricity prices continuing to reach new records, successive supplier exits during September 2021 and a new level for the default tariff cap, the Great British energy market remains on edge for fresh volatility and further consolidation,"" said Craig Lowrey, senior consultant at Cornwall Insight. Energy regulator Ofgem said the price cap ""will ensure that consumers don't pay more than is absolutely necessary this winter"". But if gas prices stay high, the price cap will rise, Ofgem said. The regulator said its ""number one priority is to protect customers"", but acknowledged ""this is a worrying time for many people"". What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? Energy price cap: Why are fuel bills rising? UK gas prices fall from record high after Russia steps in But while the price cap helps households, there is no such safeguard for businesses, which have to absorb the full impact of rising global energy prices. Mr Walker warned that Iceland's energy bill would go up by Â£20m next year. Alongside higher salaries to address lorry driver shortages and other new costs, he said grocery prices would have to increase. ""It's inevitable that we will see price rises,"" he told the BBC. ""The UK supermarket industry is one of the most competitive in the world. ""Our margins are very very tight and we're not an endless sponge that can just absorb all of these different cost increases."" Andrew Large, director general of the Confederation of Paper Industries, said: ""This is a highly inflationary situation for the British economy and members will clearly be in a position where they do try to pass those costs on to consumers where they can."" One paper manufacturer, the Northwood Group, said the industry had been ""left to fend for itself"" in the face of ""horrendous"" knock-on effects from the gas price rise. ""The spike [in gas prices] that we have seen since January is equivalent to a 550% price increase, which of course destroys any industrial planning,"" said chairman Paul Fecher. Laura Cohen, chief executive of the British Ceramic Confederation, said many of her member firms could even be forced to stop production ""due to uneconomic higher energy costs"". This could cause ""severe damage"" to production facilities such as brick kilns, which could not easily be turned off at short notice, she said. Meanwhile, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has said that by decarbonising the UK's power supply, the country will protect customers from volatile fossil fuel prices. ""The UK so far, as many of you know, has made great progress in diversifying our energy mix. But we are still very dependent, perhaps too dependent, on fossil fuels and their volatile prices,"" he told a conference organised by trade body Energy UK. He said that the government's recent pledge to decarbonise the electricity grid by 2035 - 15 years ahead of the previous target - would help. ""Our homes and businesses will be powered by affordable, clean and secure electricity generated here in the UK, for people in the UK,"" Mr Kwarteng said. The Energy Shop - a price comparison site - warned people to prepare themselves for even greater increases in household bills. It said that the next increase in the price cap, due to come in from 1 April 2022, could be Â£500 or even higher. Founder Joe Malinowski warned: ""If things don't settle down soon, increases of Â£600, Â£700 or even Â£800 cannot be ruled out."" Nine energy suppliers have already collapsed in recent weeks and more could be facing the same fate. They were unable to keep their price promises as the wholesale price of gas soared. Their customers have already seen annual bill increases of hundreds of pounds when they moved to a new provider and away from whichever low-rate fixed deal their supplier had offered. Some of the heat was drawn from the crisis on Wednesday when Russia said it would increase gas supplies to Europe. UK wholesale gas prices hit a record high during the day before falling after the Russian intervention. But price volatility could continue as investors remain nervous about low stockpiles of gas across Europe. If you feel powerless against international business and politics when watching your domestic energy bill go up, you are in good company. Normally, customers are urged to get active, search and switch to save money - but not now. Until recently, the energy price cap was a backstop, protecting the vulnerable. Now it is the most competitive tariff available. The cap is shielding households from the wild fluctuation in prices seen on the wholesale markets, but that is only a crumb of comfort when bills and prices across the board are still expected to see a sharp increase. So for now, experts simply advise customers to find ways to save energy, brace themselves and budget for bigger bills. Wrap up for a financial chill that could last longer than the winter. The energy price cap sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff. That includes the fixed daily amount customers pay, plus the price per unit they pay for electricity and gas. The cap was increased on 1 October, with about 15 million households facing a 12% rise in energy bills, the biggest jump, to the highest amount, seen since the backstop was introduced in January 2019. Those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, saw an increase of Â£139 - from Â£1,138 to Â£1,277 a year. Prepayment meter customers with average energy use saw a Â£153 increase. That's a far cry from a year previously when on 1 October 2020, the energy price cap was cut by Â£84, to Â£1,042.

What can I do if my supplier folds?,"Thirty energy companies have stopped trading in the UK since August 2021, including Bulb, which is being managed separately because of its size. What happens when a supplier goes bust, and what should consumers do? More than four million households have seen their energy firm collapse since the summer, though most suppliers are tiny compared to Bulb. Ofgem automatically moves customers to a new provider, and their supply will continue without interruption. The companies which have gone out of business are: Ampoweruk, Avro, Bluegreen, CNG Energy, Colorado Energy, Daligas, Enstroga, Entice Energy, Goto Energy, Green, Green Network Energy, Hub, Igloo Energy, MA Energy, MoneyPlus, Neon Reef, Omni Energy, Orbit Energy, People's Energy, PFP, Pure Planet, Simplicity, Social Energy Supply, Symbio Energy, Together Energy, Utility Point, Whoop Energy, Xcel Power, Zebra Power and Zog Energy. Firms have struggled because they offered customers cheap fixed deals. That meant they couldn't pass on the cost of soaring gas prices, which have risen dramatically because of a worldwide squeeze on energy supplies. The wholesale price of gas - the price that UK fuel companies pay gas suppliers - has also gone up further because of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. How high could my energy bills go? Why are prices rising so quickly? Could the world cope without Russian oil and gas? If your energy provider goes bust, you still receive gas and electricity. Because of its size, Bulbwas put into an arrangement called ""special administration"". The company is being run as normal by administrators Teneo, until a buyer can be found or its customers can be moved elsewhere. In the short-term, it meansBulb customers haven't been been transferred to another provider, and don't have to do anything,external. The accounts held by the other failed firmsare automatically moved to a new supplier by energy regulator Ofgem.,external You can't choose the provider and may end up on a more expensive tariff. Ofgemhas sent customers,externalto the following suppliers: British Gas:Bluegreen Energy Services, MoneyPlus Energy, Neon Reef, People's Energy, PFP Energy, Social Energy Supply, Together Energy and Zebra Power British Gas Evolve: Simplicity Energy EDF:Green Network, Utility Point, Zog Energy Eon:Enstroga, Hub Energy, Igloo and Symbio Octopus:Avro Energy Pozitive Energy:CNG Energy Scottish Power:Entice Energy, Orbit Energy Shell:Colorado Energy, Daligas, Goto Energy, Green, Pure Planet SmartestEnergy:MA Energy Utilita:Omni Energy YÃ¼ Energy:Ampoweruk, Xcel Power, Whoop Energy Ofgem andCitizens Advice,externalboth recommend making a note or taking a photo of your meter reading and downloading any bills, while waiting for your new supplier to get in touch. There's no need to cancel direct debits. If you're in credit, the balance will be added to your account with your new supplier. However, this may take several weeks. If you're in debt to a company which has stopped trading, you still have to pay the money you owe. You will be contacted by its administrators, or the supplier which takes over its business. It's unlikely. Usually, consumers are encouraged to shop around when energy bills rise. But at the moment better offers simply aren't available. In particular, people already on fixed deals are advised to stay put. Those coming to the end of fixed deals will be moved on to higher standard tariffs. A tariff set at the price cap limit - the maximum price suppliers can charge customers on a standard deal - will be the most competitive. Instead of searching for a cheaper deal, the Energy Saving Trust sayssimple changes to our homes and energy habits,externalcould help offset the current price rises. How to save energy at home and help the planet The price cap sets the maximum price suppliers can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff. The level of the cap is reviewed every six months. It's the reason energy suppliers haven't been able to pass on all of the recent wholesale gas price increases. The energy cap rose sharply in October 2021 and again in April 2022. Ofgem has warned thata typical energy is likely to rise by a further Â£800 in Octoberwhen the cap is next reviewed. After reviewing the cap,the regulator has also proposed that in future the cap should be updated quarterly,externalrather than every six months. The price cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market, buta number of suppliers there have also announced price increases. How much are energy bills going up?

NatWest faces fine over money laundering failingsThe state-backed bank pleads guilty to offences and could now be hit with a large penalty.Business,"Chief executive Alison Rose said NatWest took financial crime extremely seriously NatWest bank has pleaded guilty to failing to prevent alleged money laundering of nearly Â£400m by one customer. NatWest said ""we deeply regret"" failing to ""adequately monitor and therefore prevent money laundering by one of our customers between 2012 and 2016"". The state-backed bank, formerly Royal Bank of Scotland, is the first British lender to admit such an offence. Lawyers told a court hearing that NatWest faces a large fine. The case was brought by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) which alleged the bank failed to monitor suspect activity by a client that deposited about Â£365m in its accounts over five years, of which Â£264m was in cash. The criminal action, first announced by the FCA in March, was the first against a bank under a 2007 money laundering law. The FCA said NatWest failed to adhere to the requirements of anti-money laundering legislation in relation to Fowler Oldfield Ltd's account between 7 November 2013 and 23 June 2016. Fowler Oldfield was a century-old jeweller based in Bradford, and was shut down following a police raid in 2016. FCA prosecutor Clare Montgomery QC told Westminster magistrates that when Fowler Oldfield was taken on as a client by NatWest, its predicted turnover was said to be Â£15m per annum. However, it deposited Â£365m over the space of almost five years. She said: ""It was agreed that the bank would not handle cash deposits. However, it deposited Â£365m, with around Â£264m in cash."" She said that at its height, Fowler Oldfield deposited up to Â£1.8m a day. The court was told the ""likely sentence is a very large fine"". NatWest remains 55% taxpayer-owned after receiving a Â£45bn bailout at the height of the 2008 financial crisis. Chief executive Alison Rose said: ""NatWest has a vital part to play in detecting and preventing financial crime and we take extremely seriously our responsibility to prevent money laundering by third parties. ""In the years since this case, we have invested significant resources and continue to enhance our efforts to effectively combat financial crime."" Jonathan Fisher, a senior lawyer at Bright Line Law specialising in money laundering cases, said the FCA had claimed ""a big scalp"". ""The message sent to financial institutions is clear. If there are failings in your money laundering systems, criminal prosecution may follow. NatWest was sensible to take the hit, and it must now move on.""

"Likely Newcastle takeover prompts call for owners' testAmnesty International urges the Premier League to change its owners' and directors' test ""to address human rights issues"" amid the Saudi Arabian-backed takeover of Newcastle United.BBC Sport","Mike Ashley has owned Newcastle United since 2007 Amnesty International has urged the Premier League to change its owners' and directors' test ""to address human rights issues"" amid the Saudi Arabian-backed takeover of Newcastle United. Approval for the takeoverfrom the Premier League could come on Thursday. A consortium would be in control of the club, not the Saudi state. The state has been accused of human rights abuses, which Amnesty International says must be a factor in deciding whether the takeover proceeds. ""Instead of allowing those implicated in serious human rights violations to walk into English football simply because they have deep pockets, we've urged the Premier League to change their owners' and directors' test to address human rights issues,"" said Sacha Deshmukh, Amnesty International chief executive. ""The phrase 'human rights' doesn't even appear in the owners' and directors' test despite English football supposedly adhering to Fifa standards. We've sent the Premier League a suggested new human rights-compliant test and we reiterate our call on them to overhaul their standards on this. ""As with Formula One, elite boxing, golf or tennis, an association with top-tier football is a very attractive means of rebranding a country or person with a tarnished reputation. The Premier League needs to better understand the dynamic of sportswashing and tighten its ownership rules."" The Public Investment Fund (PIF), which is set to provide 80% of funds for the Â£300m deal and would be the majority owner, will be seen as separate to the state and therefore allow the takeover to pass the Premier League owners' and directors' test. However, Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman is also the chair of PIF - he was accused of ordering the death of journalist Jamal Khashoggi, which the Kingdom's leader denies. Khashoggi's fiancee, Hatice Cengiz, has also urged the Premier League not to allow the move to go through, citing the involvement of the crown prince. It is believed a resolution came after Saudi Arabia settled an alleged piracy dispute with Qatar-based broadcaster beIN Sports, which owns rights to show Premier League matches in the Middle East. But sources have told BBC Sport that an agreement between the Premier League and the consortium was found prior to the news emerging on Wednesday. With PIF deemed a separate entity, that, and any piracy issues, are no longer an impediment to the takeover in the Premier League's view. Many Newcastle fans want current owner Mike Ashley to leave the club after a 14-year reign, which they believe has been plagued by a lack of investment and ambition.

Can I get a fixed deal?,"Gas and electricity bills are going up again on 1 January, when the latest energy price cap takes effect. Customers are encouraged to submit a meter reading to ensure they are charged the correct amount. The energy price cap covers 26 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is setevery three months,externalby the energy regulator Ofgem. It fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit. Between 1 January and 31 March 2025,gas prices will be capped at 6.34p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 24.86 per kWh.,external This means the annual bill for a dual-fuel direct debit household using a typical amount of energywill go up to Â£1,738 per year, an increase of Â£21 from the previous cap. Those who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque will pay Â£1,851. Analysts at forecaster Cornwall Insight, which tracks the energy market, expect prices to fall slightly in April and October 2025, but says thathigh domestic energy prices are likely to be ""the new normal"". The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. Your energy bill depends on the overall amount of gas and electricity you use, and how you pay for it. The type of property you live in, how energy efficient it is, how many people live there and the weather all make a difference. The Ofgem cap is based on a ""typical household"" using 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit. The vast majority of people pay their bill this way to help spread payments across the year. Those who pay every three months by cash or cheque are charged more. Energy prices could vary at different times of day Submitting a meter reading when the cap changes means you will not be charged for estimated usage at the wrong rate. This is especially important when prices go up. Customers withworking smart metersdo not need to submit a reading as their bill is calculated automatically. Fixed-priced deals offer certainty for a set period - often a year, or longer - but if prices drop, you could be stuck at a higher price. Ofgem says customers who want the security of a set price should consider fixed deals. However, it recommends getting independent advice. The price comparison site Uswitch says it is important to check whether fixed deals have exit fees before signing up and to make sure you fully understand the terms of the contract. Because the price cap changes every three months, it is difficult to know with any certainty whether a fixed tariff is a good deal. The longer the fixed term, the greater the uncertainty. Between January and March, households on prepayment meters will pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of Â£1,690, a rise of Â£21 from the previous quarter. About four million households had prepayment meters in April 2024, according to Ofgem. Many have been in place for years, but some were installed more recently after customers struggled to pay higher bills. Rulesintroduced in November 2023,externalmean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts before switching them to a meter. They cannot be installed at all in certain households. Energy firms pay out over force-fitting of meters Standing charges are a fixed daily fee to cover the costs of connecting to a supply. They are typically 61p a day for electricity and 32p a day for gas, although they vary slightly by region. Under the energy price cap, they have risen by 43% since 2019. Campaigners argue standing charges are unfair because they make up a larger proportion of the bill of low energy users. Ofgem has proposed thatenergy firms must provide a choice of price-capped tariffsfrom winter 2025, one which has a standing charge and unit rate - as is the case now - and another with no standing charge but a higher unit rate. Customers would be able to choose which suits them best. Separately, it wants a consistent approach from suppliers on how to deal with unpaid bills totalling Â£3.8bn. Changes to the winter fuel payment mean more than 10 million pensioners are not receiving the money this winter. Previously, it was paid to all pensioners in England and Wales born before 25 September 1957. However, in July, the government said future payments would be made only to those on low incomes who receivedcertain benefits, including pension credit. The 2024 payment - worth Â£200 or Â£300 depending on individual circumstances - is paid automatically to eligible pensioners. However, hundreds of thousands of people who are entitled to pension credit do not claim it, which means they will miss out on the winter fuel payment too. How much is the winter fuel payment and who can still get it? TheÂ£500m Household Support Fund,,externalwhich was introduced in September 2021 to help vulnerable customershas been extended until March 2025. TheWarm Home Discount scheme,externalcontinues to offer a discount to eligible pensioners and low income households. The government'sFuel Direct Scheme,externalcan help people to repay an energy debt directly from their benefit payments.

"Nightclubs to reopen as social distancing scrappedThe legal requirement for social distancing in hospitality will be lifted from 31 October, the BBC understands.Northern IrelandComments","Nightclubs have been closed in Northern Ireland since March 2021 The legal requirement for social distancing in bars and restaurants is to be removed. Nightclubs are also to be allowed to reopen, meaning legal restrictions on dancing in venues will be scrapped. Restrictions will be lifted from 31 October. A number of mitigations have been agreed and it is thought businesses will be asked to check for vaccine certificates, but this will not be a legal requirement. Ministers have also agreed to retain the mandatory wearing of face coverings in certain settings. It is understood ministers were advised that moving legal regulations on face coverings into guidance would lead to a 30% decline in their use. The industry had argued that social distancing requirements were damaging trade. The new rules mean people will be able to move around pubs and restaurants and to eat and drink while standing up. Changes were also announced tothe UK travel red list, which has been cut from 54 countriesto seven. Michelle O'Neill and Paul Givan announced the rule changes at Stormont First Minister Paul Givan welcomed the easing of restrictions, particularly for the the hospitality sector, which he said had been hit hard during the pandemic. ""I'm pleased that at the end of this month they will be able to operate in a much more sustainable and viable way,"" he said. Mr Givan said the sector benefitted from ""a high level of adherence"" to coronavirus restrictions, adding that he believed this would continue. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she was pleased progress had been made at Thursday's executive meeting, but that people should remain cautious. ""We're in for an uncertain period ahead and we have to work our way through that as best we can,"" she said. Ms O'Neill said continuing increasing vaccination rates would also be a ""crucially important"" part of the executive's winter planning. Under existing rules, social distancing of at least 1m (3ft) remains a legal requirement in pubs, bars and restaurants in Northern Ireland. From Thursday 14 October the restrictions on the number of people allowed to meet inside a home is to be increased from 15 from four households to 30 from an unlimited number of households. From that date, people attending performances at indoor venues will not have to be seated during the performance. The executive is now moving to unlock the final stage of pandemic recovery. Nightclubs will finally get to reopen on Halloween and social distancing - something we've lived with as the norm for the past 18 months - will be scrapped. It's perhaps no surprise given how that's already the case in Great Britain and the rules south of the Irish border will end this month too. But not everything is changing - face coverings will remain - a sign that for some, caution is still needed with Covid. The executive has also warned that if things begin to go in the wrong direction again, vaccine passports could then be deployed. The Department of Health will now progress work on the system after agreement with Executive Office officials - but the onus on hospitality businesses will be to prove that a mandatory scheme isn't needed. John Leighton, owner of Bennigan's Bar, Londonderry, said easing restrictions for hospitality was fantastic news, which the sector ""had been waiting on for some time"". He said it had been a challenging and stressful time for the sector and that the timing to ease restrictions on 31 October was particularly good for Derry's annual Halloween festival. ""It means we can get back to enjoying ourselves and not having so many things to think about,"" he said. ""We can get back to a bit more normality."" Janice Gault from the Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said the restrictions which are being removed had presented ""significant challenges"" for businesses which were trying to become fully operational again. She said: ""The industry has traded well to date and our primary focus remains the health and well-being of our staff and customers. ""Winter trade, in a viable manner within a sustainable framework and without further lockdown, is our aim."" In September, the executive agreed toend social distancing restrictionsfor shops, theatres and a number of other indoor settings. They asked some sectors to put in place mitigations including proof of double vaccination or a negative lateral flow test. But this is advice and is not legally enforceable. Robin Swann is frustrated over plans to introduce a vaccine passport Last week,Health Minister Robin Swann warnedthat a delay by the executive in agreeing a vaccine passport policy had limited options for easing more restrictions. The Department of Health will now progress work to develop the digital scheme, but ministers will have to decide whether to deploy it. Ms O'Neill said she did not want things to reach that point and hoped businesses would voluntarily comply with executive advice and demonstrate they could work safely. Ministers also discusseda bid from Communities Minister Deirdre Hargeyfor Â£55m in funding to mitigate the end of a Â£20 weekly uplift for people claiming universal credit. Stormont received an extra Â£180m from the Treasury in September and that money has yet to be distributed. The expectation was that most if not all of that money would go on health spending. Mr Givan and Ms O'Neill made clear that Stormont would face major difficulties - both financially and logistically - of stepping in to top up payments Mr Givan said the Executive had to be ""honest"" with the public about the financial position. ""Now is not the time to be removing this uplift,"" he said. ""That is happening though this week and the ability, even if the executive had the funding, to do this [top up the payments] isn't there because we don't have the systems, this is administered directly through the Department for Work and Pensions in London. ""So we don't have the system. And the ability to finance it - we have to be honest with the public.""

EU to table new proposals for NI Protocol,"This video can not be played NI Protocol: ""We have to move from the tough political rhetoric"" The EU will bring forward new proposals for the Northern Ireland Protocol next week, European Commission Vice President Maros Å efÄoviÄ has said. He said he hopes they would form the basis for intensive talks with the UK. The protocol avoids a hard border on the island of Ireland by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. But unionists argue it creates a trade border between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. They say it undermines Northern Ireland's constitutional position as part of the UK. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Boris Johnson says NI Protocol could work if it was 'fixed' Mr Å efÄoviÄ told an event in Dublin that he hoped talks would begin before the end of October. He said his proposals would be ""very far reaching"" and that he hoped they would be seen as such. A UK government spokesperson said: ""Significant changes are needed to the Protocol in order to protect the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement and the peace process. ""We await a formal response from the EU to the proposals set out in our command paper. Any proposals must be subject to genuine negotiation and the commission mustn't take a 'take it or leave it' approach. ""If solutions cannot be agreed soon, we will need to act using the Article 16 safeguard mechanism to address the disruption that the protocol is causing on the ground"". Triggering Article 16 would suspend part of the protocol. Speaking to the BBC in Brussels,United States national security adviser Jake Sullivan warned the British governmentthat suspending the protocol would be a ""serious risk to stability"". He said any possibility of a return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland was ""of serious concern to the United States"". Mr Sullivan said both the UK and the EU should work together ""in a constructive way to find a deal and a way forward"". Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) - Northern Ireland's largest unionist party - had warned that itmay quit Stormontif its demands over the protocol were not met. Speaking on Thursday, the DUP leader said he was ""pleased"" that the EU was to table new proposals, adding that he believed pressure from unionists had ""opened up the protocol"". Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), warned that it may quit Stormont if its demands over the protocol were not met ""We were told weeks ago that the EU were not in a position where they were ever going to reopen negotiations, so I think we've breached the first wall,"" Sir Jeffrey said. ""And I think that is the result of unionists standing together and saying: 'Look, we cannot support this protocol; we cannot support an Irish Sea border'."" The DUP leader added: ""I think the pressure we have brought to bear and the steps that have been taken in the last few weeks have focused minds both in London and Brussels and I'm pleased that we've made this level of progress, but we still have a long way to go."" Mr Å efÄoviÄ said the EU was going to ""enormous lengths"". ""I believe the package of practical solutions that we are putting on the table would be attractive for Northern Ireland and would be, I hope, supported by a majority of stakeholders in Northern Ireland,"" he told the Institute of International and European Affairs (IIEA) in Dublin. He said the commitment of the EU to the Good Friday Agreement was ""absolute"" and that the avoidance of a hard border on the island was a ""prerequisite"". Earlier this weekUK Brexit Minister Lord Frost said he was expecting a short, intense negotiation with the EU. He told the Conservative party conference that the protocol was ""not working and needs to change"". In July, Lord Frost put forward radical proposals for changes to the protocol. Triggering Article 16, may end up as ""the only way"" forward, he warned. What is Article 16 and what exactly does it say? Mr Å efÄoviÄ said threats to trigger Article 16 were not helpful. He said his proposals were not presented on a ""take it or leave it"" basis and that both the UK and EU would need to get out of their comfort zones.

"Energy bills will rise further, warns regulator","More than a million extra British households won't be able to afford to heat and power their homes next spring, according to a charity. Energy bills are expected to rise again in April to reflect the rising wholesale price of gas. National Energy Action says 1.2 million to 1.5 million additional households will be plunged into fuel poverty. Households that spend a high proportion of their income on energy bills are considered to be in fuel poverty. At the start of October the energy price cap, which limits the impact of rising energy prices on households in England, Scotland and Wales, was raised to take the sharply rising wholesale gas price into account. But Ofgem, the energy regulator, said the price cap would have to rise again next year if wholesale gas prices continue to go up. Analysts said this could mean a typical customer paying between Â£400 and Â£600 more per year. Households in Northern Ireland have also seen a recent sharp rise in their bills, but they aren't protected by the energy price cap for Great Britain. If you feel powerless against international business and politics when watching your domestic energy bill go up, you are in good company. Normally, customers are urged to get active, search and switch to save money - but not now. Until recently, the energy price cap was a backstop, protecting the vulnerable. Now it is the most competitive tariff available. The cap is shielding households from the wild fluctuation in prices seen on the wholesale markets, but that is only a crumb of comfort when bills and prices across the board are still expected to see a sharp increase. So for now, experts simply advise customers to find ways to save energy, brace themselves and budget for bigger bills. Wrap up for a financial chill that could last longer than the winter. National Energy Action (NEA) said this month's price rises had already pushed half a million more households into fuel poverty. ""It's building into a brutal and bleak winter for millions. If the price cap goes up by Â£400 to Â£600 a year it could plunge 1.2 to 1.5 million households into fuel poverty, leaving almost 5.5 million households struggling to keep their homes warm and safe,"" said NEA chief executive Adam Scorer. NEA is calling for more support to be put in place for low income households. Ofgem, the energy regulator, said it expected prices would rise further in April. Its chief executive Jonathan Brearley said the energy cap was ""designed to reflect fair costs and therefore will need to adjust over time"". Natural gas prices are at record highs as economies around the world begin to recover from the Covid crisis. As a result, firms that supply gas to householders are running into trouble because they have agreed to sell energy at less than the price it now costs them to buy it. Even with the raising of the cap this month Mr Brearley said more energy firms could run into difficulties. ""Given the continued volatility in the market, it is likely more suppliers will exit the market,"" he told an energy conference on Thursday. Nine firms have already gone out of business, forcing 1.7 million customers to move to new suppliers. Those households have already seen annual bill increases of hundreds of pounds, since new providers aren't able to match lower-rate fixed deals that were on offer when gas prices were lower. What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? Energy price cap: Why are fuel bills rising? UK gas prices fall from record high after Russia steps in Firms warn of price rises as energy costs soar Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng, who was also attending the conference, said the right response to rising gas prices was to renew the UK's commitment to renewable energy. The government recently pledged to shift electricity generation away from fossil fuels entirely by 2035. ""The UK so far, as many of you know, has made great progress in diversifying our energy mix. But we are still very dependent, perhaps too dependent, on fossil fuels and their volatile prices,"" he said. Decarbonising heating and power would mean lower prices he said. ""Our homes and businesses will be powered by affordable, clean and secure electricity generated here in the UK, for people in the UK,"" Mr Kwarteng said. However, customers will question whether the cost of the making the transition to lower carbon energy could push bills higher in the short term. The next revision to the energy price cap will be decided by Ofgem in February but will come into force in April. Analysts Cornwall Insight said that the cap could go up by Â£400 meaning that a household with typical energy use would pay around Â£1,660 a year. However the Energy Shop - a price comparison site - warned people to prepare themselves for even greater increases in household bills. It said that the next increase in the price cap could be Â£500 or even higher. Founder Joe Malinowski warned: ""If things don't settle down soon, increases of Â£600, Â£700 or even Â£800 cannot be ruled out."" Businesses are also feeling the impact of rising energy costs. Firms are warning that could lead tohigher prices for their goodsas increases are passed on to consumers. Richard Walker, managing director of supermarket chain Iceland, said steep rises in energy bills and other costs meant price rises were now ""inevitable"". ""The UK supermarket industry is one of the most competitive in the world,"" he told the BBC. ""Our margins are very tight and we're not an endless sponge that can just absorb all of these different cost increases."" Mark Nicholson and his business partner set up their firm Harvey George Furniture four years ago in Hull. Today they employ about 30 people making bespoke bathroom and bedroom furniture. The past 18 months have been so good that they've moved premises to expand - and invested about Â£500,000 in new technology and machinery to keep up with demand. ""It's a gas guzzler - unfortunately for us it's a big gas guzzler,"" he says of their new painting machine, which is piped into the mains and is able to produce colourful furniture much faster. ""Any business, it's about cost and quite a big component for us is energy, so it's quite a scary thought. Our last bill was Â£8,000 - it was a shock. ""We'll keep going. But we could just do with some stability on our costs. It feels like everything - rates, recruitment, materials, shipping - now energy... feels very up and down."" The energy price cap sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff. That includes the fixed daily amount customers pay, plus the price per unit they pay for electricity and gas. When the cap was increased on 1 October, about 15 million households faced a 12% rise in energy bills, the biggest jump, to the highest amount, seen since the backstop was introduced in January 2019. Those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, saw an increase of Â£139 - from Â£1,138 to Â£1,277 a year. Prepayment meter customers with average energy use saw a Â£153 increase. That is a far cry from a year previously when on 1 October 2020, the energy price cap was cut by Â£84, to Â£1,042.

Find more money for universal credit - senior Tory,"The government should find Â£10bn a year to boost universal credit, former Tory minister Steve Baker has said. The Â£20-a-week increase to the benefit officially ended on Wednesday despite warnings about a squeeze on living standards and rising prices. Mr Baker said it should be an ""absolute priority"" to find extra funds as part of the upcomingspending review. The government says the benefit boost was always meant to be temporary and it is helping the most needy. Universal credit: End of the Â£20 boost explained Universal credit reduction: 'I feel overwhelmed' Firms warn of price rises as energy bills soar Claims the government is out of touch with the plight of low-income families were fuelled byan interview with the New Statesman,externalon Wednesday by Tory grandee, Sir Peter Bottomley. He said MPs need a pay rise as some were struggling financially to cope on an annual salary of just over Â£80,000. Peter Bottomley says MPs are underpaid ""I don't know how they manage. It's really grim,"" he said, arguing that a salary of around Â£110-Â£115,000 a year was needed to bring them in to line with GPs. Speaking to LBC radio, Mr Bottomley explained he was not arguing for pay rises. He said he was trying to make the point that increasing MPs' salaries would make it easier to widen the pool of people interested in switching their careers to become parliamentarians. Higher wages would make it possible for headteachers and senior executives in nursing to come to sit in Parliament rather than it being the preserve of the independently wealthy, he said. His comments come as asocial media film,externalemerged of Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey singing (I've Had) The Time of My Life at this week's Conservative conference in Manchester.

But Education Secretary Nadhim Zahawi said it was ""unfair"" to link the two. He told ITV's Good Morning Britain that ""parties and dance-offs and singing is a feature of all party conferences"", and Ms Coffey had also announced the hardship fund at Manchester. Ministers have admitted that many UK households could face""a very difficult winter"". Energy prices are surging at the same time as the universal credit top-up being withdrawn and taxes are rising to fund the NHS and social care. Butasked during the Conservative Party conferenceabout the pressure on family incomes, the prime minister told the BBC he was ""not worried""  because supply chain issues will sort themselves out ""rapidly"". And he said the economy was facing the ""stresses and strains"" of a post-Covid recovery as it moves to a ""new approach"" with higher wages and lower immigration. He said government schemes, such as a Â£500m hardship fund, would help those on the lowest incomes. Speaking to ITV's Peston, Mr Baker - an influential figure on the right of the Conservative Party - said the government should find Â£10bn a year to improve universal credit. Steve Baker says universal credit needs to be reformed He said the Â£20-a-week top-up, which was introduced to help people on low incomes through the pandemic, should be retained. He also said he had urged the government to improve the taper rate, which reduces the amount individuals can claim for every extra pound they earn, as an ""absolute priority"". But he added that he will vote for whatever the government decides in its Spending Review at the end of this month. Currently for every Â£1 claimants earn over their work allowance their benefit is reduced by 63p. Speaking on the BBC News Channel, Shadow Business Secretary, Ed Miliband said Labour was ""not giving up"" on attempts to reverse the cut to universal credit. ""It beggars belief"" he said ,that in the context of escalating energy prices and tax rises, ""the government is ploughing ahead"" with the cut to the benefit. People are facing a ""double whammy"" and the situation is going to be ""unbearable for so many families"" he added and targeting support through the social security system is the best way to help them.

'Being Scottish helped me win Nobel Prize'Prof David MacMillan says growing up in Scotland meant he learned how to communicate ideas quickly.Scotland,"Prof David MacMillan was awarded the prize for developing a new way of building molecules A Nobel Prize-winning scientist says his success is down to being Scottish and knowing how to get to a punchline. Prof David MacMillan, who is from North Lanarkshire, told the BBC that growing up in Scotland meant he learned how to convey ideas quickly. The professor said he was ""very, very proud"" of his ""working class"" upbringing in New Stevenston. He wasjointly awarded a Nobel Prize for chemistrywith German Scientist Benjamin List earlier this week. They were honoured by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences, which organises the awards, after developing a new way of building molecules. Prof MacMillan, of Princeton University in the United States, said the concept has been used to make medicines faster and has helped with the development of drugs for Alzheimer's, cancer and heart disease. Two women share chemistry Nobel in historic win Climate science breakthroughs win physics Nobel Sense of touch and heat research wins Nobel Prize He grew up in New Stevenston, near Bellshill, and gained his undergraduate degree in chemistry at the University of Glasgow before moving to the US for postgraduate studies. The scientist said his Scottish upbringing helped him learn how to tell a story and explain concepts quickly. ""Growing up in Scotland, you learn how to talk and you learn how to tell a joke and you can get to a punchline,"" he said. ""You can convey ideas quickly from growing up in Scotland - you're good at it. ""So we were able to convey to people that this was actually a pretty interesting and valuable concept that people could use in science and it certainly helped my career and certainly helped the science move forward, but it wouldn't have happened if I was not Scottish."" Prof MacMillan moved to the United States after completing his undergraduate studies at the University of Glasgow Prof MacMillan attended New Stevenston Primary School and Bellshill Academy and he praised the ""brilliant"" education he received. He said: ""I am one of those people who's incredibly lucky to have come through that system."" The scientist gained his undergraduate degree in chemistry at the University of Glasgow in 1991, before being awarded a PhD in organic chemistry at the University of California, Irvine, in 1996. He studied at Harvard University before beginning his career at the University of California, Berkeley, moving to Caltech and then Princeton in 2006. Asked to explain his discovery in layman's terms, he told BBCRadio Good Morning Scotland programme: ""If you look around yourself right now, in the studio or at home, everything around you, stuff, is all made by chemical reactions, and how those chemical reactions work is based on this thing called catalysis. ""We invented these new types of catalysis that allowed you to do things you couldn't do before, to make new materials, new stuff around you. ""But probably the most important thing immediately is how to make medicines even faster so that's been a great thing."" The Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences said on Wednesday: ""Building molecules is a difficult art. Benjamin List and David MacMillan are awarded the Nobel Prize in Chemistry 2021 for their development of a precise new tool for molecular construction: organocatalysis. ""This has had a great impact on pharmaceutical research, and has made chemistry greener."" Prof List and Prof MacMillan, who are both 53, will share the prize money of 10 million krona (Â£842,611).

"Business is not the bogeyman, firms tell Johnson","Firms and business groups have criticised the government for what they see as a lack of action to help fix supply chain shortages. During his speech at the Conservative Party, Boris Johnson said a high-wage, high-skilled economy was being created in the wake of Brexit and the pandemic. But one business group said firms had been ""left wanting"" on details of a clear plan. Retailer Iceland said it was ""not helpful"" to make firms the bogeymen. Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Iceland's managing director, Richard Walker, said ambitions on wages ""need to be backed up by action"" to help firms with wider cost increases. ""It's inevitable that we will see price rises... our margins are very tight and we're not just an endless sponge. ""Pointing the finger and choosing us as the bogeymen for issues such as HGV driver shortages... is simply not helpful."" PM: UK in period of adjustment after Brexit Greggs warns of staff shortages and rising costs Next: Overseas workers only way to solve shortages Responding to Mr Johnson's conference speech, Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) national chair Mike Cherry said that the prime minister's vision did not ""match the current lived realities of small businesses and sole traders"". Mr Cherry said that ""ambitious"" policies to drive growth and reduce tax at the autumn Budget were needed. Small firms who face supply chain disruptions, staff shortages and business taxes, Mr Cherry said, had been hoping to hear a ""practical, clear action plan"" from the government, but ""been left wanting"". ""You have to start with reducing upfront business taxes and costs to unlock investment in training, recruitment and innovation. If you think that process works in reverse, you're putting the cart before the horse"", Mr Cherry added. Shevaun Haviland, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, agreed that what businesses ""urgently"" needed were answers to the problems they are facing ""in the here and now"". ""The economic recovery is on shaky ground and if it stalls then the private sector investment and tax revenues that the prime minister wants to fuel his vision will be in short supply."" Addressing the issue of staff shortages, Ms Haviland said firms ""need much more flexibility"" for people to access training and qualifications. Tony Danker, the head of the CBI business lobby group, said that while the prime minister set out a ""compelling vision"" for the country's economic future, ""ambition"" on wages ""without action on investment and productivity is ultimately just a pathway for higher prices"". He added that at a ""fragile moment"" for the economy, companies need ""action on skills, on investment and on productivity"". ""It's time to get around the table, roll up our sleeves and get things done."" Boris Johnson's alleged four-lettered response to those businesses which had concerns about his plans for Brexit ispretty infamous. His Conservative Party conference speech was much longer (and expletive-free) but it seems that for some business leaders, it amounted to the same message. Strikingly, bosses who backed Brexit are now among those most loudly criticising the PM's approach. Mr Johnson is a politician who really doesn't mind ruffling feathers and clearly believes he has the voters on his side. It is a risky strategy though for a party which sees itself as the natural home for enterprise and for a government which is likely need private business on side to deliver much of the change it is promising.

Refund probe into Ryanair and BA dropped,"Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary always insisted the airline acted within the law over refunds Ryanair and British Airways customers who say they are owed refunds because of Covid restrictions on travel could miss out because the competition regulator says the law is unclear. The Competition and Markets Authority (CMA) has closed an investigation into the two airlines, saying there is a ""lack of [legal] clarity"". Instead of offering refunds, the carriers offered vouchers or rebooking. This, the CMA believed, probably broke the law, and a probe was launched. Although some flights went ahead, many customers were prevented from taking them because of restrictions. The CMA said the law needed clarifying. ""After a thorough examination of relevant law, and the evidence it had gathered during its investigation, the CMA has concluded that the law does not provide passengers with a sufficiently clear right to a refund in these unusual circumstances to justify continuing with the case,"" the regulator said. ""Consumer protection law sets out that passengers are entitled to refunds when an airline cancels a flight, because the firm cannot provide its contracted services. However, it does not clearly cover whether people should be refunded when their flight goes ahead but they are legally prohibited from taking it."" Global lockdown restrictions on air travel left many customers claiming ticket refunds and looking to the law for the protection. But the CMA said prolonging the case through the courts ""could not be justified given the length of time it would take"". Travel firms warned over summer holiday refunds Airlines investigated over lockdown refund cases CMA chief executive Andrea Coscelli has now called for a change in the law, adding he strongly believes people prevented from taking flights due to lockdown should get a full refund. ""Given the importance of this to many passengers who have unfairly lost out, we hope that the law in this area will be clarified,"" he said. The CMA's statement highlighted it had already secured commitments to refund hundreds of millions of pounds for people whose holidays were cancelled due to the pandemic, including from LoveHolidays, Lastminute.com, Virgin Holidays, TUI UK, Sykes Cottages, and Vacation Rentals. Both Ryanair and BA welcomed the CMA's move and defended their actions. Ryanair said: ""We operated a limited schedule during UK lockdowns for customers who travelled for essential reasons. Passengers had the option to change their bookings without paying the flight change fee and many availed of this option."" And BA said: ""During this unprecedented crisis we have acted lawfully at all times, issuing nearly 4 million refunds and offering highly flexible booking policies enabling millions of our customers to change their travel dates or destinations.""

"NatWest pleads guilty to money laundering offencesThe state-backed bank ""deeply regrets"" its failings, but now faces a large fine.Business","Chief executive Alison Rose said NatWest took financial crime extremely seriously NatWest bank has pleaded guilty to failing to prevent alleged money laundering of nearly Â£400m by one customer. NatWest said ""we deeply regret"" failing to ""adequately monitor and therefore prevent money laundering by one of our customers between 2012 and 2016"". The state-backed bank, formerly Royal Bank of Scotland, is the first British lender to admit such an offence. Lawyers told a court hearing that NatWest faces a large fine. The case was brought by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) which alleged the bank failed to monitor suspect activity by a client that deposited about Â£365m in its accounts over five years, of which Â£264m was in cash. The criminal action, first announced by the FCA in March, was the first against a bank under a 2007 money laundering law. The FCA said NatWest failed to adhere to the requirements of anti-money laundering legislation in relation to Fowler Oldfield Ltd's account between 7 November 2013 and 23 June 2016. Fowler Oldfield was a century-old jeweller based in Bradford, and was shut down following a police raid in 2016. FCA prosecutor Clare Montgomery QC told Westminster magistrates that when Fowler Oldfield was taken on as a client by NatWest, its predicted turnover was said to be Â£15m per annum. However, it deposited Â£365m over the space of almost five years. She said: ""It was agreed that the bank would not handle cash deposits. However, it deposited Â£365m, with around Â£264m in cash."" She said that at its height, Fowler Oldfield deposited up to Â£1.8m a day. The court was told the ""likely sentence is a very large fine"". NatWest remains 55% taxpayer-owned after receiving a Â£45bn bailout at the height of the 2008 financial crisis. Chief executive Alison Rose said: ""NatWest has a vital part to play in detecting and preventing financial crime and we take extremely seriously our responsibility to prevent money laundering by third parties. ""In the years since this case, we have invested significant resources and continue to enhance our efforts to effectively combat financial crime."" Jonathan Fisher, a senior lawyer at Bright Line Law specialising in money laundering cases, said the FCA had claimed ""a big scalp"". ""The message sent to financial institutions is clear. If there are failings in your money laundering systems, criminal prosecution may follow. NatWest was sensible to take the hit, and it must now move on.""

"EU to table new proposals for NI ProtocolThe proposals will be ""very far reaching"", says European Commission Vice President Maros Å efÄoviÄ.Northern Ireland","This video can not be played NI Protocol: ""We have to move from the tough political rhetoric"" The EU will bring forward new proposals for the Northern Ireland Protocol next week, European Commission Vice President Maros Å efÄoviÄ has said. He said he hopes they would form the basis for intensive talks with the UK. The protocol avoids a hard border on the island of Ireland by keeping Northern Ireland in the EU's single market for goods. But unionists argue it creates a trade border between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. They say it undermines Northern Ireland's constitutional position as part of the UK. What is the Northern Ireland Protocol? Boris Johnson says NI Protocol could work if it was 'fixed' Mr Å efÄoviÄ told an event in Dublin that he hoped talks would begin before the end of October. He said his proposals would be ""very far reaching"" and that he hoped they would be seen as such. A UK government spokesperson said: ""Significant changes are needed to the Protocol in order to protect the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement and the peace process. ""We await a formal response from the EU to the proposals set out in our command paper. Any proposals must be subject to genuine negotiation and the commission mustn't take a 'take it or leave it' approach. ""If solutions cannot be agreed soon, we will need to act using the Article 16 safeguard mechanism to address the disruption that the protocol is causing on the ground"". Triggering Article 16 would suspend part of the protocol. Speaking to the BBC in Brussels,United States national security adviser Jake Sullivan warned the British governmentthat suspending the protocol would be a ""serious risk to stability"". He said any possibility of a return to a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland was ""of serious concern to the United States"". Mr Sullivan said both the UK and the EU should work together ""in a constructive way to find a deal and a way forward"". Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) - Northern Ireland's largest unionist party - had warned that itmay quit Stormontif its demands over the protocol were not met. Speaking on Thursday, the DUP leader said he was ""pleased"" that the EU was to table new proposals, adding that he believed pressure from unionists had ""opened up the protocol"". Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), warned that it may quit Stormont if its demands over the protocol were not met ""We were told weeks ago that the EU were not in a position where they were ever going to reopen negotiations, so I think we've breached the first wall,"" Sir Jeffrey said. ""And I think that is the result of unionists standing together and saying: 'Look, we cannot support this protocol; we cannot support an Irish Sea border'."" The DUP leader added: ""I think the pressure we have brought to bear and the steps that have been taken in the last few weeks have focused minds both in London and Brussels and I'm pleased that we've made this level of progress, but we still have a long way to go."" Mr Å efÄoviÄ said the EU was going to ""enormous lengths"". ""I believe the package of practical solutions that we are putting on the table would be attractive for Northern Ireland and would be, I hope, supported by a majority of stakeholders in Northern Ireland,"" he told the Institute of International and European Affairs (IIEA) in Dublin. He said the commitment of the EU to the Good Friday Agreement was ""absolute"" and that the avoidance of a hard border on the island was a ""prerequisite"". Earlier this weekUK Brexit Minister Lord Frost said he was expecting a short, intense negotiation with the EU. He told the Conservative party conference that the protocol was ""not working and needs to change"". In July, Lord Frost put forward radical proposals for changes to the protocol. Triggering Article 16, may end up as ""the only way"" forward, he warned. What is Article 16 and what exactly does it say? Mr Å efÄoviÄ said threats to trigger Article 16 were not helpful. He said his proposals were not presented on a ""take it or leave it"" basis and that both the UK and EU would need to get out of their comfort zones.

"Business is not the bogeyman, firms tell JohnsonThe boss of Iceland says blaming business for supply shortages is ""simply not helpful"".Business","Firms and business groups have criticised the government for what they see as a lack of action to help fix supply chain shortages. During his speech at the Conservative Party, Boris Johnson said a high-wage, high-skilled economy was being created in the wake of Brexit and the pandemic. But one business group said firms had been ""left wanting"" on details of a clear plan. Retailer Iceland said it was ""not helpful"" to make firms the bogeymen. Speaking to the BBC's Today programme, Iceland's managing director, Richard Walker, said ambitions on wages ""need to be backed up by action"" to help firms with wider cost increases. ""It's inevitable that we will see price rises... our margins are very tight and we're not just an endless sponge. ""Pointing the finger and choosing us as the bogeymen for issues such as HGV driver shortages... is simply not helpful."" PM: UK in period of adjustment after Brexit Greggs warns of staff shortages and rising costs Next: Overseas workers only way to solve shortages Responding to Mr Johnson's conference speech, Federation of Small Businesses (FSB) national chair Mike Cherry said that the prime minister's vision did not ""match the current lived realities of small businesses and sole traders"". Mr Cherry said that ""ambitious"" policies to drive growth and reduce tax at the autumn Budget were needed. Small firms who face supply chain disruptions, staff shortages and business taxes, Mr Cherry said, had been hoping to hear a ""practical, clear action plan"" from the government, but ""been left wanting"". ""You have to start with reducing upfront business taxes and costs to unlock investment in training, recruitment and innovation. If you think that process works in reverse, you're putting the cart before the horse"", Mr Cherry added. Shevaun Haviland, director general of the British Chambers of Commerce, agreed that what businesses ""urgently"" needed were answers to the problems they are facing ""in the here and now"". ""The economic recovery is on shaky ground and if it stalls then the private sector investment and tax revenues that the prime minister wants to fuel his vision will be in short supply."" Addressing the issue of staff shortages, Ms Haviland said firms ""need much more flexibility"" for people to access training and qualifications. Tony Danker, the head of the CBI business lobby group, said that while the prime minister set out a ""compelling vision"" for the country's economic future, ""ambition"" on wages ""without action on investment and productivity is ultimately just a pathway for higher prices"". He added that at a ""fragile moment"" for the economy, companies need ""action on skills, on investment and on productivity"". ""It's time to get around the table, roll up our sleeves and get things done."" Boris Johnson's alleged four-lettered response to those businesses which had concerns about his plans for Brexit ispretty infamous. His Conservative Party conference speech was much longer (and expletive-free) but it seems that for some business leaders, it amounted to the same message. Strikingly, bosses who backed Brexit are now among those most loudly criticising the PM's approach. Mr Johnson is a politician who really doesn't mind ruffling feathers and clearly believes he has the voters on his side. It is a risky strategy though for a party which sees itself as the natural home for enterprise and for a government which is likely need private business on side to deliver much of the change it is promising.

"NatWest pleads guilty to money laundering offencesThe state-backed bank ""deeply regrets"" its failings, but now faces a large fine.Business'Build affordable homes in second homes hotspot'""Young people still haven't got a hope in hell of buying a local home,"" says local councillor.Wales","Chief executive Alison Rose said NatWest took financial crime extremely seriously NatWest bank has pleaded guilty to failing to prevent alleged money laundering of nearly Â£400m by one customer. NatWest said ""we deeply regret"" failing to ""adequately monitor and therefore prevent money laundering by one of our customers between 2012 and 2016"". The state-backed bank, formerly Royal Bank of Scotland, is the first British lender to admit such an offence. Lawyers told a court hearing that NatWest faces a large fine. The case was brought by the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) which alleged the bank failed to monitor suspect activity by a client that deposited about Â£365m in its accounts over five years, of which Â£264m was in cash. The criminal action, first announced by the FCA in March, was the first against a bank under a 2007 money laundering law. The FCA said NatWest failed to adhere to the requirements of anti-money laundering legislation in relation to Fowler Oldfield Ltd's account between 7 November 2013 and 23 June 2016. Fowler Oldfield was a century-old jeweller based in Bradford, and was shut down following a police raid in 2016. FCA prosecutor Clare Montgomery QC told Westminster magistrates that when Fowler Oldfield was taken on as a client by NatWest, its predicted turnover was said to be Â£15m per annum. However, it deposited Â£365m over the space of almost five years. She said: ""It was agreed that the bank would not handle cash deposits. However, it deposited Â£365m, with around Â£264m in cash."" She said that at its height, Fowler Oldfield deposited up to Â£1.8m a day. The court was told the ""likely sentence is a very large fine"". NatWest remains 55% taxpayer-owned after receiving a Â£45bn bailout at the height of the 2008 financial crisis. Chief executive Alison Rose said: ""NatWest has a vital part to play in detecting and preventing financial crime and we take extremely seriously our responsibility to prevent money laundering by third parties. ""In the years since this case, we have invested significant resources and continue to enhance our efforts to effectively combat financial crime."" Jonathan Fisher, a senior lawyer at Bright Line Law specialising in money laundering cases, said the FCA had claimed ""a big scalp"". ""The message sent to financial institutions is clear. If there are failings in your money laundering systems, criminal prosecution may follow. NatWest was sensible to take the hit, and it must now move on.""

Scotland's students face accommodation 'nightmare',"Scotland is facing a ""student housing emergency"" driven by a shortage of available accommodation and soaring rents. NUS Scotland has warned unprecedented demand has left some homeless and others considering dropping out. Anecdotal evidence suggests some landlords are asking for six months' rent upfront while others are holding off to make a profit fromCOP26. The Scottish government said it was concerned by the reports. A spokesman also confirmed it was carrying out a review of purpose-built student accommodation. Studentsreturned to campusesacross the country last month after a year in which many subjects were taught entirely online due to the pandemic. Kyle MacKinnon has been struggling to find a new property with his old flatmate since he returned to Edinburgh from Harris last month. The final year student at Edinburgh Napier University told BBC Scotland: ""So far it has been an absolute nightmare. ""There has been very few people getting back to us and even fewer viewings."" Kyle MacKinnon is in the final year of his degree course at Napier University in Edinburgh Mr MacKinnon said when he does get a reply it is to inform him viewings are fully booked or the property is no longer available. Asked about his current situation, he said: ""Right now I am on my friend's sofa in the west end of Edinburgh. ""It is a nice area but not very comfortable and not very good for the long term for studying."" Mr MacKinnon said a lot of his friends and fellow undergraduates have struggled as well. He said: ""I have seen jokes on Facebook groups that finding a flat has been harder than their degrees so far."" Many find themselves priced out of the market which currently offers, for example, a two-bedroom flat in the Dalry area for Â£1,300 a month. Mr MacKinnon said students are either targeting private halls as a solution or turning to more affordable areas, such as Leith, despite the longer commute involved. Last year was a write-off for most when it came to the full ""university experience"". Online learning was the norm and there was limited socialising. Now things are getting slightly closer to normal, this situation with housing is causing concern. Students unions say they have never had this many requests for support to help people find places to live. We are hearing stories of students sofa-surfing and of those who have nowhere to go at all. The long-term plan is to build more accommodation but the short-term solution is less clear. NUS Scotland president Matt Crilly said he was ""deeply concerned"" about reports students are struggling to find accommodation for the current academic, year. He has written to the Scottish government to highlight his concerns. ""For many students, particularly those studying in the central belt of Scotland, there is currently a lack of safe and affordable accommodation,"" Mr Crilly said. ""With purpose-built student accommodation full, shortages in the private rented sector, and landlords holding off to make a profit from COP26, I am concerned we have a student housing emergency."" Mr Crilly said he was aware of some landlords increasing rent for new tenants by hundreds of pounds extra per month. Anecdotal evidence also suggests some students are being expected to pay six months of rent upfront. Matt Crilly, president of the National Union of Students in Scotland, wants the Scottish government to intervene The NUS president added: ""It is completely unacceptable that any student would be experiencing homelessness and left without accommodation when classes have already started. ""However, this issue is not unique to the current academic year. Scotland has been dragging its heels on providing adequate and affordable accommodation for students for years, which is why we see large areas with substandard housing dominated by intimidating landlords."" Mr Crilly urged ministers to ""urgently intervene"" to address the situation and introduce a student housing strategy to ensure no student is left without a roof over their head. He also called for rents to be brought under control and for a points-based rent controls system, which is tied to the property rather than the lease, in a bid to stop landlords being able to hike rents between tenancies. The Scottish Green's education spokesman Ross Greer described the current situation as ""really grim"". He told BBC Radio Scotland'sDrivetimeprogramme: ""I am aware of one case of a mature student who, with her child at the moment, is in a homeless shelter because she has been unable to find accommodation."" Mr Greer said it was the result of a ""perfect storm"" of factors including house in multiple occupation (HMO) licence delays in Scotland, the popularity of short-term Airbnb-style lets and rent increases that have far outstripped the growth in wages. Earlier this week the programme heard from the parents of students who are struggling to find accommodation. One said his son spoke to an estate agent who revealed one flat attracted 600 inquiries. And a mother said her son was currently commuting from Edinburgh to Glasgow for lectures as flat viewings in the city are typically full ""within five minutes."" John Blackwood, chief executive of the Scottish Association of Landlords (SAL), said: ""We are seeing a chronic shortage of private rented accommodation across Scotland, partly as a result of landlords leaving the sector over the past couple of years which has reduced supply. ""In addition, landlords warned  in 2017 that an unintended consequence of the Private Residential Tenancy (PRT) could be a reduction in accommodation available to students as landlords were no longer able to offer fixed-term leases which matched with term times. ""As a result, properties which landlords would hold back and market specifically for students are now rented by people as their primary home on a longer-term basis.  One of the key aims of the PRT has been achieved but it is students who are suffering."" Jamie Hepburn, the minister for higher and further education, said the government was concerned about the issues raised by NUS Scotland. ""While the Scottish Government has no direct role in the provision of student residential accommodation, we would strongly encourage students with those concerns to speak with their college or university,"" he added. ""We are determined to improve accessibility, affordability and standards across the rented sector and are carrying out a review of purpose built student accommodation. ""We are also working to deliver a new deal for tenants giving them more secure, stable, affordable tenancies with improved standards of accommodation, new controls on rent and more flexibility to personalise homes.""

"Council tax could rise by Â£220, say researchers","Council tax in England could rise by as much as Â£220 per year within three years, researchers have said. This is to keep local services running and help pay for social care reforms, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank said. It comes amid warnings that councils continue to face severe funding pressures due to the pandemic and must find new sources of income. The government said it had given them Â£12bn since the start of the crisis. Under current government spending plans, council tax bills will need to rise by at least 3.6% a year just to keep services running at pre-pandemic levels, the IFS said. That would mean bills would have to rise by Â£160 by 2024-25, it said. But extra cost pressures that eat into central government grants could easily push up council tax by 5% a year, or Â£220 by 2024-25, it said. Social care changes at-a-glance Covid: What is council tax and should it go up in the pandemic? In addition,the government's plans for social care, which include capping costs, won't be completely paid for by a planned rise in National Insurance contributions, the IFS said. The plans are likely to cost Â£5bn per year eventually, it said, nearly three times the funding currently allocated. The government has made much of the idea that after decades of governments neglecting the increasingly pressing issue of underfunded social care, this was a nettle it was determined to grasp. What's concerning in the IFS report is who might get stung. A large part of the goal of the social care reforms was to address unfairness in the means-testing system. But the IFS report highlights the risk that, without further funding, it could create new unfairness elsewhere. To extend publicly-funded care to those who've spent Â£86,000 of their own money on fees will cost extra, and local authorities may only be able to recoup that by tightening eligibility criteria - so many poorer people lose access. Second, the way the funds are allocated to local authorities dates back to 2013. Because some areas like Blackpool have seen their populations fall, but others, like Tower Hamlets have seen them jump since then, the risk is that the money won't go where it needs to. IFS research economist Kate Ogden said: ""The government has stepped up with billions in additional funding for councils to support them through the last 18 months. ""It is likely to have to find billions more for councils over the next couple of years if they are to avoid cutting back on services, even if they increase council tax by 4% a year or more."" She said that the coming financial year is ""likely to be especially tough"", with ongoing Covid-19-related pressures and squeezes on budgets She added that the local government funding system was ""hopelessly out of date"", being based on 2013 population levels, leading to ""unfairness"" in the distribution of resources between councils. Council tax goes towards funding local services such as policing, the fire service and street cleaning. The funding is topped up with grants from central government and business taxes. However, these central government grants were slashed between 2009-10 and 2019-20, especially in areas such as public transport, housing and planning. The Local Government Association said councils ""continue to face severe funding and demand pressures that will stretch the local services our communities rely on to the limit"". ""The significant financial pressures facing local services cannot be met by council tax income alone,"" said LGA chairman James Jamieson. ""Councils are particularly alarmed that the government's solution for tackling social care's core existing pressures appears to be solely through the use of council tax, and the social care precept."" Mr Jamieson called for local services to be ""the top priority"" in the upcoming Spending Review. A government spokesperson said: ""The government has allocated more than Â£12bn directly to councils since the start of the pandemic - with more than Â£6bn available to spend as they see fit - recognising that councils are best placed to deal with local issues. ""We have also taken historic action to fix the social care crisis - the Health and Social Care Levy will raise Â£12bn a year to fund the NHS and social care. ""The Spending Review will continue to focus on supporting jobs and delivering the public's key priorities.""

"Prince Andrew to receive Epstein-Giuffre agreementHis legal team believes the sealed document will end a case brought by his accuser, Virginia Giuffre.","Virginia Giuffre, then Roberts, was pictured with Prince Andrew in London in 2001 Prince Andrew has been granted access to a sealed document his lawyers believe could help end the sexual abuse case being brought by Virginia Giuffre. A US judge gave permission for the agreement between Ms Giuffre and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein to be shared with the prince's lawyers. Ms Giuffre's lawyers had made the offer to release the document but believe it will be ""irrelevant"" to the civil case. The Duke of York, 61, has consistently denied Ms Giuffre's allegations. Ms Giuffre, 38, claims she was sexually assaulted by the prince at three locations including New York City. Prince accepts being served with US lawsuit papers Post, courier, e-mail - the saga to serve papers on Andrew Andrew B Brettler, who represents Prince Andrew, had argued at a previous hearing that Ms Giuffre had entered into a ""settlement agreement"" with Epstein that would end her current legal action, During the first pre-trial hearing of the case last month, Prince Andrew's lawyer said the agreement ""releases the duke and others from any and all potential liability"". The prince's lawyers have said in court that Ms Giuffre agreed in 2009 not to sue anyone else connected to Epstein when she settled her damages claim against the billionaire sex offender, who died in prison in 2019. The precise wording of that deal is currently confidential - sealed by a court. In a court document filed on Wednesday, US Judge Loretta Preska agreed to a request from Ms Giuffre's lawyer, David Boies, to provide the duke's legal team with the document. Mr Boies previously said about the document: ""Although we believe that the release is irrelevant to the case against Prince Andrew, now that service has been accepted and the case is proceeding to a determination on the merits, we believe that counsel for Prince Andrew have a right to review the release and to make whatever arguments they believe appropriate based on it."" Then known as Virginia Roberts, Ms Giuffre claims she was assaulted by the prince at the London home of Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, and at Epstein's homes in Manhattan and Little Saint James, in the US Virgin Islands. Her case claims Prince Andrew engaged in sexual acts without Ms Giuffre's consent, including when she was 17, knowing how old she was, and ""that she was a sex-trafficking victim"". The prince has consistently denied the claims and, in 2019, told BBC Two's Newsnight programme: ""It didn't happen.""

Stormont to decide on relaxing more Covid-19 rules,"Nightclubs have been closed in Northern Ireland since March 2021 The legal requirement for social distancing in bars and restaurants is to be removed. Nightclubs are also to be allowed to reopen, meaning legal restrictions on dancing in venues will be scrapped. Restrictions will be lifted from 31 October. A number of mitigations have been agreed and it is thought businesses will be asked to check for vaccine certificates, but this will not be a legal requirement. Ministers have also agreed to retain the mandatory wearing of face coverings in certain settings. It is understood ministers were advised that moving legal regulations on face coverings into guidance would lead to a 30% decline in their use. The industry had argued that social distancing requirements were damaging trade. The new rules mean people will be able to move around pubs and restaurants and to eat and drink while standing up. Changes were also announced tothe UK travel red list, which has been cut from 54 countriesto seven. Michelle O'Neill and Paul Givan announced the rule changes at Stormont First Minister Paul Givan welcomed the easing of restrictions, particularly for the the hospitality sector, which he said had been hit hard during the pandemic. ""I'm pleased that at the end of this month they will be able to operate in a much more sustainable and viable way,"" he said. Mr Givan said the sector benefitted from ""a high level of adherence"" to coronavirus restrictions, adding that he believed this would continue. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said she was pleased progress had been made at Thursday's executive meeting, but that people should remain cautious. ""We're in for an uncertain period ahead and we have to work our way through that as best we can,"" she said. Ms O'Neill said continuing increasing vaccination rates would also be a ""crucially important"" part of the executive's winter planning. Under existing rules, social distancing of at least 1m (3ft) remains a legal requirement in pubs, bars and restaurants in Northern Ireland. From Thursday 14 October the restrictions on the number of people allowed to meet inside a home is to be increased from 15 from four households to 30 from an unlimited number of households. From that date, people attending performances at indoor venues will not have to be seated during the performance. The executive is now moving to unlock the final stage of pandemic recovery. Nightclubs will finally get to reopen on Halloween and social distancing - something we've lived with as the norm for the past 18 months - will be scrapped. It's perhaps no surprise given how that's already the case in Great Britain and the rules south of the Irish border will end this month too. But not everything is changing - face coverings will remain - a sign that for some, caution is still needed with Covid. The executive has also warned that if things begin to go in the wrong direction again, vaccine passports could then be deployed. The Department of Health will now progress work on the system after agreement with Executive Office officials - but the onus on hospitality businesses will be to prove that a mandatory scheme isn't needed. John Leighton, owner of Bennigan's Bar, Londonderry, said easing restrictions for hospitality was fantastic news, which the sector ""had been waiting on for some time"". He said it had been a challenging and stressful time for the sector and that the timing to ease restrictions on 31 October was particularly good for Derry's annual Halloween festival. ""It means we can get back to enjoying ourselves and not having so many things to think about,"" he said. ""We can get back to a bit more normality."" Janice Gault from the Northern Ireland Hotels Federation said the restrictions which are being removed had presented ""significant challenges"" for businesses which were trying to become fully operational again. She said: ""The industry has traded well to date and our primary focus remains the health and well-being of our staff and customers. ""Winter trade, in a viable manner within a sustainable framework and without further lockdown, is our aim."" In September, the executive agreed toend social distancing restrictionsfor shops, theatres and a number of other indoor settings. They asked some sectors to put in place mitigations including proof of double vaccination or a negative lateral flow test. But this is advice and is not legally enforceable. Robin Swann is frustrated over plans to introduce a vaccine passport Last week,Health Minister Robin Swann warnedthat a delay by the executive in agreeing a vaccine passport policy had limited options for easing more restrictions. The Department of Health will now progress work to develop the digital scheme, but ministers will have to decide whether to deploy it. Ms O'Neill said she did not want things to reach that point and hoped businesses would voluntarily comply with executive advice and demonstrate they could work safely. Ministers also discusseda bid from Communities Minister Deirdre Hargeyfor Â£55m in funding to mitigate the end of a Â£20 weekly uplift for people claiming universal credit. Stormont received an extra Â£180m from the Treasury in September and that money has yet to be distributed. The expectation was that most if not all of that money would go on health spending. Mr Givan and Ms O'Neill made clear that Stormont would face major difficulties - both financially and logistically - of stepping in to top up payments Mr Givan said the Executive had to be ""honest"" with the public about the financial position. ""Now is not the time to be removing this uplift,"" he said. ""That is happening though this week and the ability, even if the executive had the funding, to do this [top up the payments] isn't there because we don't have the systems, this is administered directly through the Department for Work and Pensions in London. ""So we don't have the system. And the ability to finance it - we have to be honest with the public.""

France sends ambassador back to Australia amid row,"Scott Morrison (right) did not warn Emmanuel Macron of Australia's plans during a meeting in June France will send its ambassador back to Australia to ""redefine"" relations, after Canberra reneged on a deal to buy French submarines and sparked a row. Last month, Australia formed the Aukus security pact with the US and the UK - aimed at maintaining Western influence in the Asia-Pacific. That saw Australia end a $65bn (Â£48bn) deal with France to instead access US nuclear-powered submarine technology. Paris called the deal a ""stab in the back"". Soon after the shock announcement, France recalled its ambassadors from Canberra and Washington DC in protest. But whileit has sought to mend the rift with the US, France has continued to freeze out Australia. Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison has said French President Emmanuel Macron has refused to take his calls. Australia's trade minister has also been shunned by his French counterpart. Aukus pact delivers France some hard truths Australia's big gamble on the US over China Johnson and Macron speak after military pact row Last week,negotiations over an Australia-EU trade deal were also pushed back, in what was widely interpreted as a result of the row. French officials have said they were blindsided by Canberra, which had maintained talks about the French submarines while working to secure an alternative deal. France's contract to build a fleet of conventionally powered submarines for Australia, dating to 2016, was to be a key part of France's regional engagement. This video can not be played Australiaâs ârisky betâ to side with US over China Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian said on Wednesday that while his country would ""start afresh"" with Australian relations, it would ""not have an impact in our determination to remain engaged in the Pacific"". The returning ambassador to Australia would also ""defend our interests"" over the scrapped submarine contract. Canberra has already spent over $900m on the French programme and is expected to pay a minimum $288m exit fee for breaking the contract. Australia has said it understands France's ""deep disappointment"". ""Australia values its relationship with France, which is an important partner and a vital contributor to stability, particularly in the Indo-Pacific. This will not change,"" Australian Foreign Minister Marise Payne said last month. Aukus is widely seen as a response to the growing power of China.

New parents still struggling to access support,"New parents are struggling to access health and family support services for their children a year-and-a-half after the Covid pandemic started, MPs say. A Commons Petitions Committee report called on the government to urgently put support in place for parents who missed out during lockdown. The committee urged the government to publish a ""dedicated Covid-19 recovery strategy for new parents"". The government says it recognises the challenges and has increased support. The report, the second on the issue from the committee, found the Covid-19 pandemic ""continues to have a significant impact"" on new parents' access to support services and childcare availability. The report is called Impact of Covid-19 on new parents: one year on. It said that rather than implementing the committee's recommendations from its first report a year ago - the government ""refused to act on nearly all of them"". Parents 'must get right to furlough' for childcare 'I couldn't hold my baby without permission' Parents' stress levels 'rise with lockdowns' Committee chair Catherine McKinnell said: ""We have continued to receive petitions highlighting the difficulties new parents, and the services they rely on during the vital early months of their child's life, have continued to face over the last year. ""It is clear that the impact of the pandemic is still being felt. ""The government must now reconsider its response and urgently take action to put in place support."" She said it was particularly concerning that no extra funds had been made available to help new parents with mental health issues. She added: ""It has been incredibly valuable to hear from petitioners and experts on this subject, and the committee will continue to challenge the government to bring forward the changes we have concluded need to be made."" The committee report calls for: extra funding and resources to allow catch-up mental health support for new parents and to boost perinatal mental health services funding for local authorities to arrange in-person visits to new parents by councils, voluntary organisations or health visiting staff by the end of the year a review of monitoring and enforcement activity relating to employers' health and safety obligations to pregnant women legislation on the planned extension of redundancy protections for new and expectant mothers a review into the funding, affordability and provision of childcare, and the sustainability of the childcare sector The committee also sought the views of 8,700 new parents and childcare providers. The vast majority of respondents, 93%, said they had not been able to access crucial baby and toddler groups over the past year. And three-quarters said they had not been able to find childcare they could afford. Stacey, a mum from Kent, struggled when health visitor appointments for her newborn baby were mainly held online during lockdown. Stacey says she found it difficult during lockdown with her son, Bellamy She had one appointment on the phone but says: ""That level of support I think is severely diminished because you can't physically be there. What if it then leads to problems?"" Speaking to BBC Newsbeat, she said: ""All of that on top of new mum stress and figuring out this baby who you thought you knew and at every step changes. That was really difficult."" Stacey thinks there should have been more support for young mums including seminars online to watch if there is a problem, but says they're still not widely available. ""It's like they haven't learnt from those past 18 months, how difficult it is."" Ros Bragg, director of charity Maternity Action, commented: ""The situation for new and expectant mothers is really quite desperate in the aftermath of Covid. ""It's clear from the Petitions Committee report that this group has been disproportionately affected by the fallout from the pandemic - but the government has consistently failed to act. ""Our helplines are struggling to cope with the volume of calls from pregnant women and new mothers facing unfair redundancies, as maternity discrimination continues to increase sharply."" Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance which represents childcare providers, says the committee is right to call for a review into early years funding. ""Substantial further investment into the early years is needed to ensure that providers can deliver affordable, accessible - and crucially, sustainable - early care and education,"" he said. ""If the government is truly committed to helping families recover from the impact of Covid-19, it must ensure that this includes helping parents of babies and young children to access the services and support they need."" A government spokesperson said: ""We recognise the challenges faced by new parents during the pandemic, which is why we have increased support for them. ""This includes expanding specialist mental-health services, making an unprecedented investment in childcare, and introducing parental bereavement leave. ""We will respond to the committee's recommendations in full in due course.""

Intel not considering UK chip factory after Brexit,"Pat Gelsinger became chief executive of Intel in February The boss of Intel says the US chipmaker is no longer considering building a factory in the UK because of Brexit. Pat Gelsinger told the BBC that before the UK left the EU, the country ""would have been a site that we would have considered"". But he added: ""Post-Brexit... we're looking at EU countries and getting support from the EU"". Intel wants to boost its output amid a global chip shortage that has hit the supply of cars and other goods. The firm - which is one of the world's largest makers of semiconductors - says the crisis has shown that the US and Europe are too reliant on Asia for its chip-making needs. Intel is investing up to $95bn (Â£70bn) on opening and upgrading semiconductor plants in Europe over the next 10 years, as well as boosting its US output. But while Mr Gelsinger said the firm ""absolutely would have been seeking sites for consideration"" in the UK, he said Brexit had changed this. ""I have no idea whether we would have had a superior site from the UK,"" he said. ""But we now have about 70 proposals for sites across Europe from maybe 10 different countries. ""We're hopeful that we'll get to agreement on a site, as well as support from the EU... before the end of this year."" Chip shortage could last into 2023, says car boss Why is there a chip shortage? Microchips are vital components in millions of products from cars to washing machines, but they have been in short supply this year due to surging demand and supply chain issues. It has led to shortages of popular goods like cars and computers and driven up prices - issues Mr Gelsinger said were set to continue into Christmas. ""There is some possibility that there may be a few IOUs under the Christmas trees around the world this year,"" he said. ""Just everything is short right now. And even as I and my peers in the industry are working like crazy to catch up, it's going to be a while."" He said things would ""incrementally"" improve next year but were unlikely to stabilise until 2023. Intel's expansion comes as the overall market for semi-conductors is set more than double in the next seven years to around $800bn. The firm also hopes to secure subsidies from US and European politicians, who feel their reliance on Asia for chips could threaten national security. Today the US only produces around 12% of the world's semiconductors, while Korea's Samsung and Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing Company (TSMC) account for 70% of global supply. ""It is clearly part of the motivation of a globally balanced supply chain that nobody should be too dependent on somebody else,"" Mr Gelsinger told the BBC. Intel will continue outsourcing some of its chip-making but eventually hopes to make most of its products in-house. Competing won't be easy, though. Chip-making is still far cheaper in Asia and Intel's rivals continue to expand. TSMC, the world's largest contract maker of semi-conductors, will spend $100bn on increasing capacity over the next three years while Samsung invests $205bn. Mr Gelsinger said he is confident Intel can still regain its leading edge. ""This is an industry that we created in the US, Intel's the company that puts silicon into Silicon Valley,"" he said. ""But we realise these are good companies, they're well capitalised, they're investing, they're innovating together. So we have to re-earn that right of unquestioned leadership.""
