Trump blocks postal funds to stymie mail-in voting,"The coronavirus pandemic has hit the US Postal Service hard President Donald Trump says he opposes additional funds for the US Postal Service as it would boost mail-in voting he claims would help Democrats. Mr Trump has previously claimed that mail-in voting would hurt his campaign, which polls show to be in a tight race with Democratic candidate Joe Biden. Democrats denounced Mr Trump's comment, saying his position is an attempt to prevent Americans from voting him out. A record number of people are expected to vote by mail due to the pandemic. On Wednesday, Mr Trump told reporters he refused to sign off on $25bn (Â£19bn) in emergency funding for the Postal Service or $3.5bn for election security due to the high price tag. Mr Trump has repeatedly condemned mail-in voting as an opportunity for fraud and election interference. Does US postal voting lead to âtremendous fraudâ? Democrats call for probe into US postal service On Thursday, he said his reason for blocking the funds was due to his opposition to mail-in ballots. ""They want $3.5bn for something that will turn out to be fraudulent. That's election money, basically,"" Mr Trump said in a telephone interview with Fox Business Network. ""Now they need that money in order to make the post office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots,"" he continued. He added: ""Now, if we don't make a deal, that means they don't get the money. That means they can't have universal mail-in voting, they just can't have it."" Despite Mr Trump's claims, there is little evidence that mail-in voting - which the US military uses - is rife with fraud or that it favours one political party more than another. A spokesman for Mr Biden condemned the comment, saying: ""The president of the United States is sabotaging a basic service that hundreds of millions of people rely upon, cutting a critical lifeline for rural economies and for delivery of medicines, because he wants to deprive Americans of their fundamental right to vote safely during the most catastrophic public health crisis in over 100 years."" How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? How you can be US president without winning most votes ""This is an assault on our democracy and economy by a desperate man who's terrified that the American people will force him to confront what he's done everything in his power to escape for months - responsibility for his own actions,"" added spokesman Andrew Bates. The US postal system is currently experiencing a slowdown in mail deliveries, which critics say is due to policies put in place by Mr Trump's selection to run the service. Postmaster General Louis DeJoy, who donated millions to Mr Trump's campaign and to other Republicans, has been accused of deliberately undermining public confidence in the service to deter people from mail-in voting. Mr DeJoy is the first postmaster general in 20 years to not be appointed from within the agency's own ranks. Does US postal voting lead to fraud?

Call for migrants' free school meals extension,"Free school meals should be permanently extended to the children of migrants in England who are currently ineligible for public support, charities say. During the coronavirus outbreak the meal scheme has temporarily included some pupils whosefamilies have ""no recourse to public funds"" (NRPF).,external Sixty organisations have written to the education secretary asking him to permanently extend the scheme. The government said it would continue while Covid-19 ""impacts schools"". NRPF status is given to some migrants as a condition of their right to remain in the UK - generally those who have not yet qualified for permanent residency - and prevents them from receiving most government-funded benefits. Who gets free school meals? The government has already made a U-turn on providing free school meals outside of term-time. That came afteran intervention in June by Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford,who campaigned for the government to offer free school meal vouchers over the summer holidays in England. Now charities and trade unions have demanded ministers change their policy again, ensuring children from low-income migrant families with no recourse to public funds are added to the list of those eligible for free meals when schools reopen. In a letter to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson,,externalthe 60 organisations, which includes the Children's Society, Unison, and Action for Children, said they ""applauded"" the decision to extend free school meals to some NRPF families in April. However, they said they were ""extremely concerned by the government's intention to stop providing free school meals to these children in the near future"". ""The progress the government has made by extending this vital lifeline to NRPF families will be lost unless you make this change permanent,"" the letter says. ""We ask that you urgently provide clarity to these families ahead of the return to school in September by confirming that they will continue to be eligible for free school meals - fully and permanently."" Analysis by Oxford University's Migration Observatory, published on Friday, suggests more than 175,000 children in the UK are from NRPF families. Sam Royston, director of policy and research for the Children's Society, said that those figures showed the number of children affected was rising, adding that ""whether a child is able to eat should not depend on their parents' immigration status"". A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""We have temporarily extended free school meal eligibility to include some children of groups who have no recourse to public funds in light of the current unique circumstances many families face at this time. ""This will continue for the duration of the summer holidays and while the outbreak impacts schools."" This video can not be played Marcus Rashford: ""I'm grateful the prime minister changed his decision"" Meanwhile, a law firm has also prepared a possible legal challenge, arguing that excluding poor children from free school meals because of immigration status is discriminatory and a breach of human rights. Matthew Gold & Co Ltd. Solicitors has been instructed to challenge the eligibility criteria for free school meals. In England, about 1.3 million children claimed for free school meals in 2019 - about 15% of state-educated pupils. Children of all ages living in households on income-related benefits may be eligible, from government-maintained nurseries through to sixth forms. Eligibility varies slightly between England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland because the nations set their own rules. During the coronavirus lockdown the government provided vouchers to families in England whose children qualified for free meals, which it then extended over the summer holidays. Children eligible could receive a Â£90 food voucher to cover the six-week summer holiday, or Â£105 if their school had a seven-week break. Will my child get free school meals this summer holiday?

Hundreds test positive for Covid at M&S supplier,"Greencore produces sandwiches for M&S at its factory in Northampton Almost 300 people have tested positive for Covid-19 following an outbreak at a factory which makes M&S sandwiches. Greencore in Northampton started ""proactively testing"" workers due to rising numbers of cases in the town. Lucy Wightman, Director of Public Health at Northamptonshire County Council, said 299 workers had tested positive. A spokesman for the company, which employs 2,100 people, said those who tested positive were self-isolating. He added that in each case it had ""conducted contact tracing"". Mrs Wightman said 220 people had tested positive as part of Greencore's testing and another 79 ""through the national process"" and all were employees at the site. She said 1,300 employees had been tested but there might be up to 100 more cases as between 300 and 400 results are yet to come back. The first four cases were identified on 28 July, with a further nine cases on 3 August leading Public Health Northamptonshire to ask workers to get tested. Once the 79 positive results came back, Greencore began mass testing over the last three days. Greencore said production at the plant was ""continuing as usual"" and it had no concerns about its products. By Peter Sherlock, BBC England Data Unit Northampton has been on a watchlist as an area of concern since 23 July after infection rates began rising in the town. It had the 12th highest rate of coronavirus infections in England - with the equivalent of 38 positive cases for every 100,000 people. That is still significantly below the levels of infection seen in north-west England, where council leaders have introduced stricter lockdown measures.  In Oldham and Pendle, for example, the infection rate is around 100 cases for every 100,000 people. But the confirmation of almost 300 new cases at the Greencore factory takes things to a worrying new level, and will heighten fears of a local lockdown. Northampton hadalready been identified as potentially facing a local lockdown. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the town increased from 67 in the week ending 1 August up to 85 for the week ending 8 August. Jonathan Nunn leader of Northampton Borough Council said the outbreak was ""dreadful"" and ""disappointing"". He said the council ""hopes that it is still the case"" Northampton would avoid a local lockdown. Public Health Northamptonshire said things such as car sharing and workers behaviour outside work led to the outbreak at Greencore One of those to test positive was Bakers' Union's branch secretary for the factory, Nicolae Macari. He said he tested positive on 4 August, along with his mother and father - who also work at Greencore - and his wife. ""When suddenly three or four people are pulled out of a line because they have tested positive, people are terrified,"" he said. Mrs Wightman said Greencore had ""highly effective measures in place and they continue to work extremely hard to exceed the requirements needed to be Covid-19 secure within the workplace"". She said the outbreak was ""about how people behave outside of Greencore, not at work,"" adding if people failed to follow the rules ""a possible local lockdown will follow"".

Trump stokes Kamala Harris 'birther' theory,"President Donald Trump says he has ""heard"" Democratic candidate Kamala Harris ""doesn't qualify"" to serve as US vice-president, amplifying a fringe legal theory critics decry as racist. She was born in the US to a Jamaican father and Indian mother in Oakland, California, on 20 October 1964. As such, she is eligible to serve as president or vice-president. For years, Mr Trump promoted a false ""birther"" theory that ex-President Barack Obama was not born in the US. Ms Harris, a California senator, was named on Tuesday as the first woman of colour to serve as running mate on a main-party US presidential ticket. Profile: Who is Kamala Harris? Why Kamala Harris embraces her biracial roots How Kamala Harris could help - or hurt - Joe Biden She is deputy to Democratic White House candidate Joe Biden, who will challenge Mr Trump, a Republican, in November's general election. ""The VP has the same eligibility requirements as the president,"" Juliet Sorensen, a law professor at Northwestern University, told the Associated Press (AP) news agency. ""Kamala Harris, she has to be a natural-born citizen, at least 35 years old, and a resident in the United States for at least 14 years. She is. That's really the end of the inquiry."" Anyone born in the US and subject to its jurisdiction is a natural born citizen, regardless of the citizenship of their parents, says the Cornell Legal Information Institute. The Biden campaign sent a scathing statement in response to the president stoking the false conspiracy theory. ""Donald Trump was the national leader of the grotesque, racist birther movement with respect to President Obama and has sought to fuel racism and tear our nation apart on every single day of his presidency,"" a Biden campaign spokesman said in an email. ""So it's unsurprising, but no less abhorrent, that as Trump makes a fool of himself straining to distract the American people from the horrific toll of his failed coronavirus response that his campaign and their allies would resort to wretched, demonstrably false lies in their pathetic desperation."" After a conservative law professor questioned Ms Harris' eligibility based on her parents' immigration status at the time of her birth, Mr Trump was asked about the argument at a press conference on Thursday. The president said: ""I just heard it today that she doesn't meet the requirements and by the way the lawyer that wrote that piece is a very highly qualified, very talented lawyer. This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? ""I have no idea if that's right. I would have assumed the Democrats would have checked that out before she gets chosen to run for vice-president. ""But that's a very serious, you're saying that, they're saying that she doesn't qualify because she wasn't born in this country."" The reporter replied there was no question that Ms Harris was born in the US, simply that her parents might not have been permanent US residents at the time. Earlier on Thursday, a Trump campaign adviser, Jenna Ellis, reposted a tweet from the head of conservative group Judicial Watch, Tim Fitton. This video can not be played Kamala Harris' childhood home reacts to Biden pick In that tweet, Mr Fitton questioned whether Ms Harris was ""ineligible to be vice-president under the US constitution's 'citizenship clause'"". He also sharedthe opinion piece published in Newsweek,externalmagazine by John Eastman, a law professor at Chapman University in California, that Mr Trump was asked about. Prof Eastman cites Article II of the US Constitution's wording that ""no person except a natural born citizenâ¦ shall be eligible to the office of president"". He also points out that the 14th Amendment to the constitution says ""all persons bornâ¦ in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens"". This video can not be played A look back at Joe Biden's life and political career Prof Eastman's argument, which he claims is also being made by other ""commentators"", hinges on the idea that Ms Harris may not have been subject to US jurisdiction if her parents were, for example, on student visas at the time of their daughter's birth in California. ""Her father was (and is) a Jamaican national, her mother was from India, and neither was a naturalized US citizen at the time of Harris' birth in 1964. That, according to these commentators, makes her not a 'natural born citizen' - and therefore ineligible for the office of the president and, hence, ineligible for the office of the vice president."" In 2010, Prof Eastman ran to be the Republican candidate for California attorney general. He lost to Steve Cooley, who went on to be defeated by Ms Harris, the Democratic candidate, in the general election. Following furious backlash to the Newsweek op-ed, its editor-in-chief Nancy Cooper stood by the decision to publish, arguing on Thursday that Prof Eastman's article had ""nothing to do with racist birtherism"" and was instead ""focusing on a long-standing, somewhat arcane legal debate"". Berkeley Law School Dean Erwin Chemerinsky told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that Prof Eastman's argument about Ms Harris' eligibility was ""truly silly"". He wrote in an email: ""Under section 1 of the 14th Amendment, anyone born in the United States is a United States citizen. ""The Supreme Court has held this since the 1890s. Kamala Harris was born in the United States."" Laurence Tribe, a constitutional law professor at Harvard University and frequent critic of President Trump, called Prof Eastman's argument ""garbage"" and ""racist birtherism redux"". Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School, told AP: ""Let's just be honest about what it is: It's just a racist trope we trot out when we have a candidate of colour whose parents were not citizens."" Back in 2011, Mr Trump began stoking right-wing theories that President Obama might have been born in Kenya. Even when Mr Obama produced a copy of his birth certificate in April that year showing he was born in Hawaii, Mr Trump continued to claim it was a ""fraud"". This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""Hillary Clinton... started the ""birther"" controversy During a September 2016 press conference, Mr Trump, then the Republican White House candidate, was asked about the matter. He sought to take credit for dispelling doubts over Mr Obama's eligibility, telling reporters: ""I finished it. President Obama was born in the United States. Period."" Mr Trump also argued in 2016 that his Republican rival Ted Cruz was not eligible to run for president because he was born in Canada to a US citizen mother and a Cuban-born father.

Israel and UAE strike historic peace deal,"Benjamin Netanyahu and Prince Mohammed Al Nahyan brokered the agreement with US help Israel and the United Arab Emirates have reached a deal to normalise relations, with Israel agreeing to suspend its controversial plans to annex parts of the occupied West Bank. In a surprise statement by US President Donald Trump, who helped broker it, the countries called the accord ""historic"" and a breakthrough toward peace. Until now Israel has had no diplomatic relations with Gulf Arab countries. But shared worries over Iran have led to unofficial contacts between them. Palestinian leaders were reportedly taken by surprise. A spokesman for President Mahmoud Abbas said the deal amounted to ""treason"", and the Palestinian ambassador to the UAE was being recalled. President Trump called the deal between Prime Minister Netanyahu and Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan ""a truly historic moment"". It marks only the third Israel-Arab peace deal since Israel's declaration of independence in 1948, after Egypt and Jordan. ""Now that the ice has been broken I expect more Arab and Muslim countries will follow the United Arab Emirates,"" he told reporters in the Oval Office, saying there would be a signing ceremony at the White House in the coming weeks. Earlier, in response to a President Trump's tweeted announcement, Mr Netanyahu wrote in Hebrew: ""Historic day."" In a TV address Mr Netanyahu said he had ""delayed"" West Bank annexation plans, but those plans remain ""on the table"". Annexation would make some West Bank areas officially part of Israel. ""There is no change in my plan to apply our sovereignty to Judea and Samaria [West Bank] in full co-ordination with the US. I'm committed to it. That hasn't changed. I remind you that I was the one who put the issue of sovereignty over Judea and Samaria on the table. This issue remains on the table,"" he said. Mr Netanyahu said Israel would co-operate with the UAE in developing a coronavirus vaccine, in energy, water, environmental protection and many other fields. Analysts say the deal could mean a foreign policy victory for President Trump, who will seek re-election in November, and give a personal boost to Prime Minister Netanyahu, who is on trial for alleged corruption. Both leaders have seen their approval ratings drop because of their response to the coronavirus pandemic. And in Israel, some on the right who want to annex the West Bank expressed anger over the announcement. This video can not be played Israel annexation: What is the West Bank? The UAE's ambassador to the US, Yousef Al Otaiba, said the deal with Israel was""a win for diplomacy and for the region"",external, adding: ""It is a significant advance in Arab-Israeli relations that lowers tensions and creates new energy for positive change"". Senior Trump adviser Jared Kushner said he did not think Israel would move ahead with any annexation before discussing it first with the US. He said he expected to see interactions ""very quickly"" between Israel and the UAE. Egypt signed a deal with Israel in 1979, and Jordan in 1994. Mauritania also established diplomatic ties with Israel in 1999, but froze the deal in 2009. The establishment of full diplomatic relations; the exchange of embassies; and normal trade ties between Israel and the UAE is a significant diplomatic step forward. But inevitably it raises questions. Will the full promise of this agreement be realised? And might other Gulf countries follow a similar path? It is also important to see what it is not. This is far from the comprehensive peace plan to resolve the Palestinian question that President Trump has long promoted. However, there are short-term benefits for all sides. The White House was first off the mark in announcing the deal; it is perhaps a small diplomatic feather in President Trump's cap at a time when his re-election prospects are looking more difficult. For Israel's embattled Prime Minister Netanyahu, it gets him off a hook of his own making; his much-vaunted promise to annex key parts of the occupied West Bank. This has proved undeliverable, not least due to US ambivalence and significant international opposition. Mr Netanyahu may see this ""peace initiative"" with the UAE as something that could bolster his chances if he precipitates a further Israeli general election. For the UAE, it is harder to say precisely what the immediate benefits are, though its relations with Washington will be strengthened and the deal with Israel may yield significant economic, security and scientific benefits. Overall this is an agreement that potentially could offer both more and less than might first appear. And as far as the Palestinians are concerned, it is hard to see this news creating anything other than frustration, that they have once again been pushed to the sidelines. In the coming weeks delegations from Israel and the UAE will meet to sign bilateral deals,externalregarding investment, tourism, direct flights, security, telecommunications, technology, energy, healthcare, culture, the environment, the establishment of reciprocal embassies, and other areas of mutual benefit. ""Opening direct ties between two of the Middle East's most dynamic societies and advanced economies will transform the region by spurring economic growth, enhancing technological innovation, and forging closer people-to-people relations,"" the joint statement says. Israel will also ""suspend declaring sovereignty over areas outlined"" in President Trump's Vision for Peace between Israel and the Palestinians, in which he backed an Israeli plan to annex Jewish settlements in the West Bank and the strategic Jordan Valley. What does Trumpâs Mid-East plan say on key issues? Explainer: Israel, annexation and the West Bank The Palestinians have warned that such a move would destroy their hopes of a viable future independent state and violate international law - a stance supported by much of the international community. The UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Anwar Gargash, said the UAE's recognition of Israel was ""a very bold step"" to stop the ""ticking time bomb"" of Israel's annexation of the West Bank. He said the UAE saw this as ""a stoppage of the annexation, not a suspension"". Asked about Palestinian criticism of the UAE move, he recognised that the region was very polarised and he expected to hear ""the usual noise"".  ""We agonised over this,"" he said, but eventually decided ""let's do it"". The joint statement says Israel will ""focus its efforts now on expanding ties with other countries in the Arab and Muslim world"", and that the US and UAE will work to achieve that goal. The UAE and Israel will also join the US to launch a ""Strategic Agenda for the Middle East"", with the three leaders noting that they ""share a similar outlook regarding the threats and opportunities in the region, as well as a shared commitment to promoting stability through diplomatic engagement, increased economic integration, and closer security co-ordination"". UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said ""it was my profound hope that annexation did not go ahead in the West Bank and today's agreement to suspend those plans is a welcome step on the road to a more peaceful Middle East"". Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi welcomed the deal while Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said the agreement could help push ahead stalled peace negotiations. But a senior Palestinian official, Hanan Ashrawi, condemned the deal, saying the UAE had ""come out in the open on its secret dealings/normalisation with Israel"" and telling Prince Mohammed: ""May you never be sold out by your 'friends'."" Iran's foreign ministry called the accord ""shameful"", according to state news agency IRNA. And in Gaza, the Hamas militant group called the deal a ""stabbing in the back of our people.""

Tributes paid to three killed in train derailment,"Family tributes have been paid to Brett McCullough, Donald Dinnie and Chris Stuchbury The families of three men killed in a train derailment in Aberdeenshire have told of their devastation at their deaths. Train driver Brett McCullough, conductor Donald Dinnie and a passenger now named as Christopher Stuchbury, 62, died in the incident near Stonehaven. A major investigation has begun into the derailment, believed to have been caused by a landslip after heavy rain. Mr Stuchbury, from Aberdeen, worked for a marine services firm in the city. In a statement his family said: ""Chris was a much adored husband, son, dad, stepdad, grandad, brother and uncle and was a treasured and loved friend to many."" What we know about the Stonehaven derailment Three dead after passenger train derails Mr Stuchbury worked for Targe Towing and volunteered at Roxburghe House hospice in Aberdeen in his spare time. Earlier, the family of Mr McCullough described how his death had left a ""huge void"" in their lives. His wife Stephanie said: ""Words cannot describe the utterly devastating effect of Brett's death on his family and friends. ""We have lost a wonderful husband, father and son in the most awful of circumstances. ""Brett was the most decent and loving human being we have ever known and his passing leaves a huge void in all our lives. ""We would like to thank the emergency services for their heroic efforts in helping everyone affected by this tragedy and for all the messages of support and condolence we have received."" Investigation work continues at the scene of the derailment The 45-year-old father-of-three was originally from Bromley in London. He worked out of the Aberdeen rail depot and lived near the scene of the derailment. The third victim was 58-year-old conductor Donald Dinnie, whose family said they were devastated by the loss of a ""loving and proud dad, son, partner, brother, uncle and friend"". ""No words could ever describe how much he will be missed by us all and there will always be a missing piece in our hearts,"" they said in a statement. ""It is so heart warming to see how many people have fond memories of Donald and I am sure they have plenty of happy and funny stories to tell. He was a kind, caring and genuine person who was never found without a smile on his face. We know he will be deeply missed by all."" Mr Dinnie had also worked as a driver and guard during his railway career. It is thought that the 06:38 Aberdeen to Glasgow Queen Street service was derailed by a landslide afterheavy rainin the area. The alarm was raised at about 09:40 on Wednesday morning. Six others who were on the train were taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. NHS Grampian said four of them had been discharged, while the other two patients were in a stable condition. A section of the train fell down a steep embankment Emergency services remained at the scene of the accident on Thursday First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the ""hearts of a nation"" were with those affected. Scottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson, UK Transport Minister Grant Shapps and Network Rail chief executive Andrew Haines all visited the site of the crash on Thursday. Mr Shapps has asked Network Rail to produce an interim report by 1 September on the ""wider issues"" that may have led to the derailment. He said he wanted to see resilience checks carried out in ""the next few days, few hours"", given the concern about flash floods in the area.

He also said he spoke with PC Liam Mercer, the first officer on the scene, and commended him for his bravery. And he understood an off-duty conductor managed to get off a carriage and run to alert operators, while a member of the public raised the alarm having seen smoke billowing from the trees. Mr Matheson said he did not want to speculate about what had caused the incident. ""What I think we can assess, though, is that weather has had an impact,"" he said. Mr Matheson visited Aberdeenshire on Thursday morning ""We are seeing increasingly a higher level of what are localised intense weather events that are having an impact on the transport network, including the rail network. ""What we need to do as part of the investigation is identify to what extent it had an impact and also to see what lessons can be learned."" He said some parts of the country had seen a month's rainfall in just a couple of hours on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning. He added that the derailment happened as the train driver was heading north, trying to return to Aberdeen, and that one crew member got out of the derailed train to prevent any other trains coming down the track. This video can not be played Aerial footage shows the passenger train derailment in Aberdeenshire Mr Haines said he did not want to pre-empt the outcome of the investigation. But he added: ""It is clear the weather was appalling and there were floods and landslips in the area. ""Our climate is changing and it is increasingly challenging the performance and reliability of the railway, but incidents like yesterday's devastating accident are incredibly rare, and our railway remains the safest major railway in Europe. ""Yesterday was a tragedy, a truly horrific event, and my thoughts remain with everyone affected. Understanding what happened is the key to making sure it never occurs again."" Network Rail said it would carry out detailed inspections of high-risk trackside slopes with similar characteristics to the site of the Aberdeenshire crash. Dozens of sites across Britain will be assessed using in-house engineers, specialist contractors and helicopter surveys. Scotland's Lord Advocate has asked Police Scotland, British Transport Police and the Office of Rail and Road, the independent regulator, to conduct a joint investigation into the accident. It will be carried out under the direction of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, and will run in parallel to the independent safety investigation being carried out by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch.

Anger over 'unfair' A-level results,"This year's exams were cancelled because of the Covid-19 pandemic There is anger among schools, colleges and students, after nearly 40% of A-level grades awarded on Thursday were lower than teachers' predictions. In England, 36% of entries had a lower grade than teachers predicted and 3% were down two grades, in results after exams were cancelled by the pandemic. School and college leaders are calling for a review and say all fees for appeals should be waived. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the results were a ""robust set of grades"". The overall results, across England, Northern Ireland and Wales, show record highs for A* and A grades. But David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, said he had heard from a number of colleges where more than half of their school-assessment grades have been adjusted downwards following moderation. Paul Whiteman leader of the heads' union  NAHT said: ""The government must make sure that there is no financial barrier to a school or college making an appeal."" Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union said: ""While there had been an overall increase in top grades, there was a ""great deal of volatility among the results at school and student level."" He said students felt grades had been pulled down ""in a way that they feel to be utterly unfair and unfathomable"". This video can not be played How does the class of 2020 feel about finishing college during a pandemic? He called on the government and exams watchdog Ofqual to review the moderation process in England ""as a matter of urgency"". ""We would warn them against simply digging in their heels, and insisting all is well. ""This results day must have been an absolute nightmare for many schools, colleges, and young people - it is a shambles."" For the top  A* and A grades, independent schools in England saw the greatest improvement on last year - up 4.7 percentage points. This compares with a 1.7, 2 and 0.3 percentage points improvement for top grades for England's academies, comprehensives and colleges respectively. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said pupils would be able to sit exams if they feel they could have done better. ""Where pupils are disappointed, where they feel that they could have done better, where they feel that there's an injustice been done to them, there is the possibility of appeal and they can re-sit, they can take a re-sit this autumn as well."" What's next in the arguments over exam results? A third of NI A-level grades lower than predicted 'Unfair' A-level results claim as grades lowered Will the exam 'triple lock' affect me? And other questions ""But looking at the big picture, I think overall we've got a very robust set of grades, plus you've got the situation in which more pupils than ever before are getting their first choice course at university and more kids from disadvantaged backgrounds going to university."" Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said the ""majority of young people will have received a calculated grade today that enables them to progress to the destination they deserve, with the added safety net of being able to appeal on the basis of their mock results, as well as the chance of sitting autumn exams"". But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""Something has obviously gone horribly wrong with this year's exam results. ""Nearly 40% of young people have had their grades marked down and that's thousands of young people whose opportunities could have been dashed."" Many students went back into school or college to receive their results The exam results show: for A-levels: 9% of entries were A* (up from 7.8% in 2019) 27.9% were A* and A (up from 25.5% in 2019) these are the highest ever levels of A* and As - up from a previous high of 27% in 2011 78.4% of entries were A*-C (up from 75.8% in 2019) Psychology now the second most popular subject, after maths girls outperform boys, except in A*s in England, the moderation means that 36% of results have been lowered by one grade, 3% by two grades, 2% have increased there will be 25,000 university courses available in clearing, including 4,500 in top Russell Group universities for vocational qualifications, the Department for Education says results ""broadly in line with previous years"" The proportion of entries getting an A* or A grade is at a record high this year - with the 27.9% above the previous highest of 27% in 2011. And there are increases in those getting A* to C - as the exam regulator had promised a more lenient approach. At Wilberforce Sixth Form College in Hull, while some students were celebrating, others were very disappointed. Abbi is one of those students who is not happy with her results, saying she had missed out on her place at Durham University to study engineering. She said she would now have to consider retakes or finding a clearing place at another university. ""It seems like some unfair grading. When I opened them I had a bit of a cry,"" she told the BBC. Abbi's grades mean she has missed out on a place to study engineering at Durham University ""My future has been set back completely,"" she said. ""I had my heart set on Durham and it's now not an option for clearing because there's no clearing for my course."" ""I would have happily sat the exams but it was up to the government,"" she said, adding that she was angry her results had been affected by something out of her control. BTec students 'hopeful for the future' Students warn that using mocks 'makes mockery' of exams Exam rituals put on hold this year In Wales students promised no A-levels lower than AS-level grades Scottish pupils to have exam results upgraded Principal Colin Peaks said he had never seen ""such a negative feeling"" on results day in all his years of teaching. Mr Peaks said there was ""something worrying across the board"", with many good students not getting the grades they would have expected. ""The anomalies within the system aren't right - I'm seeing anomalies across the piece that do not make sense to me."" He said basing results, in part, on last year's students' results was wrong because ""they're different"". ""We are going to see lots of appeals,"" he added. Students taking vocational exams have been getting estimated results over recent weeks - with more than 250,000 receiving their grades in BTec and Cambridge Technical qualifications which are equivalent to A-levels and strong GCSE passes. The Department for Education says vocational results are ""broadly in line with previous years"". Brenda Irabor from Ark Academy in Brixton, south London, achieved three A* grades Figures from the admissions service, Ucas, show that more students have been accepted onto UK degree courses this year. Among UK applicants, 358,860 have been accepted - a 2.9% rise compared with 2019. Of these, 316,730 have been accepted on to their first choice, up 2.7% on the same point last year. Clearing is an increasingly popular route for students to find a degree course, with leading universities among those offering last-minute places through the system, Ucas said. By Sean Coughlan, education correspondent This is a strange year for A-level results in every way, with grades arriving for exams that were never taken. In more usual times the headlines would have been about this being a record year for top grades - with almost 28% getting A*s or As. But instead this has been an exam results day full of uncertainty, with head teachers warning about volatility below the surface of rising grades. Almost two out of every five results were lower than the grades predicted by their teachers - and heads are warning of a confusing pattern of where results have gone down. But, at the same time, those trying to get to university might find that they're able to get in with lower grades than in previous years, with the promise of ""super-flexible"" admissions. The confusion extends to what happens next. Because for those getting bad news today, it could still be good news through the appeals process. Have you got your A-level or BTec results today?

Lockdown to ease further in England from Saturday,"Newlyweds will be able to celebrate their nuptials with a wedding reception in the form of a sit down meal for up to 30 guests More beauty treatments, small wedding receptions and live indoor performances will be able to resume in England from Saturday, as lockdown rules are eased. Bowling alleys, casinos and soft play centres will also be able to reopen, PM Boris Johnson has announced. It comes as the government introduces bigger fines for failing to wear a mask in places where it is compulsory. Meanwhile, quarantine measures have been imposed on more countries,including France and the Netherlands. The easing of lockdown rules is now due to come into force on Saturday, after being postponed from 1 August due to concerns about a slight increase in the number of people testing positive for coronavirus in England. Last week, figures from the Office for National Statistics showed thismay be levelling off. However,the latest government figures released on Friday,externalshowed the number of daily positive tests in the UK was the highest it has been since 14 June. In the 24-hour period up to 09:00 BST, there were a further 1,441 confirmed cases, taking the total number to 316,367. Under the latest changes: Indoor theatre, music and performance venues will be able to reopen with socially distanced audiences Wedding receptions in the form of a sit-down meal for up to 30 guests will be permitted The piloting of a small number of sporting events to test the safe return of spectators will resume, commencing with the final of the World Snooker Championship at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre over the weekend Casinos, bowling alleys, skating rinks and soft play centres will be allowed to reopen ""Close contact"" beauty services such as facials, eyebrow threading, eyelash treatments, make up application and microblading will resume Pilots will take place at conference venues ahead of the expected resumption of business events from 1 October at the earliest The new guidance will not apply in areas where local lockdown measures are in place, the government said. Local lockdown rules vary from place to place, but since July measures have been introduced in Leicester, Preston, East Lancashire, parts of West Yorkshire. Greater Manchester, and Aberdeen. What are the rules for face masks or face coverings? How to stay cool in a face mask What can't I do in the local lockdowns?,external The Department of Health said restrictions on household gatherings in parts of the North West, West Yorkshire, East Lancashire and Leicester will continue. The latest data does not show a decrease in the number of cases per 100,000 people in the area and shows a continued rise in cases in Oldham and Pendle, while numbers remain high in Blackburn with Darwen, the department said. The measures will be reviewed again next week. Soft play centres are among the venues able to reopen from 15 August Devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the power to set their own timings for the easing of restrictions. The prime minister said that plans to open up more of the economy this weekend ""will allow more people to return to work and the public to get back to more of the things they have missed"". But Mr Johnson reiterated a warning that the government ""will not hesitate to put on the brakes if required, or to continue to implement local measures to help to control the spread of the virus"". Salon's phone 'ringing off hook' as lockdown eases 'Mixed emotions' as soft play gets green light New guidance will also mean that staff offering ""close contact"" services, including hairdressers, will now have to wear a face mask as well as a clear visor. The government said the move, which follows new evidence from the scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) is aimed at protecting customers and staff from respiratory droplets caused by sneezing, coughing, or speaking. It also applies to businesses that operate remotely, such as massage therapists working in people's homes, and those learning in vocational training environments. Nightclubs and discos are among the venues that remain closed in law. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic On Thursday, France reported 2,524 new coronavirus cases in 24 hours, the highest daily increase since its lockdown was lifted in May. Under current guidance, people who refuse to wear a face covering where it is required face a Â£100 fine, which can be reduced to Â£50 if paid within 14 days. The new enforcement measures will see that penalty repeatedly doubled for subsequent offences, up to a maximum of Â£3,200. ""Most people in this country are following the rules and doing their bit to control the virus, but we must remain focused and we cannot be complacent,"" Mr Johnson said. ""That is why we are strengthening the enforcement powers available to use against those who repeatedly flout the rules."" By Tom Symonds, home affairs correspondent Just as cases of Covid-19 rose in the spring, peaked and fell, so has the use by police of fines to enforce social distancing restrictions. This means that instead, officers have increasingly preferred to ""engage, explain and encourage"" in the police jargon. It is difficult and sometimes risky work. ""Encouraging"" large groups of young people to leave illegal parties has led to violence. Senior officers say they are prepared to prosecute the organisers. However, in general, police believe they have got people to follow the rules hundreds of thousands of times without handing out fines. The question is whether local breakouts of the virus, and the risk of a ""second wave"" will increase the pressure for a tougher approach. As countries are added to the list of those from which returning travellers have to quarantine, there could also be questions about whether there is a realistic risk of catching people who refuse to do so. In England, face coverings are mandatory in many indoor settings, including public transport, shops and museums, with some exemptions for children or on medical grounds. Transport for London and British Transport Police have already made 91,501 interventions based on present face coverings guidance, the government said - preventing 4,397 from boarding, asking 3,030 to leave the network and issuing 341 penalty notices. There will also be a clampdown on illegal gatherings of more than 30 people, which could see those responsible hit with spot fines of up to Â£10,000. This video can not be played Face coverings are mandatory in England in all shops According to the government, forces across England and Wales have already stepped up patrols to prevent illegal gatherings in areas of concern, such as Leicester and Greater Manchester, where it said deployments have sometimes been larger than on New Year's Eve. Last weekend, West Midlands Police shut down 125 parties and raves - and closed a pub - taking action to stop illegal gatherings and anti-social behaviour across the region. Further detail on the new enforcement measures is to be set out in the coming week. Home Secretary Priti Patel said she would not allow progress against the virus to be undermined by ""a small minority of senseless individuals"". ""These measures send a clear message - if you don't cooperate with the police and if you put our health at risk, action will follow.""

BTec students 'hopeful for future',"Anyone leaving college, school or university and hoping to work this summer faces an uncertain jobs market, with the economy experiencing biggest fall in employment for a decade. But are some careers more ""pandemic proof"" than others? BTec student Harry Baker, 20 certainly hopes so. He studied for a Level 3 BTec in  health and social care at Sheffield College, has achieved three distinction star grades and will go to Sheffield Hallam University to study biomedical science. ""I'm hoping to work in some sort of laboratory to do research into diseases, and I imagine there'll be a lot more focus on lab work now in the future."" Harry says his course meant he had to complete assessed modules throughout the two years of study, making it a ""very hands-on way of learning"". Harry hopes to research diseases in his future career In terms of results day, he feels the continuous assessment throughout his course means students like him ""have less pressure than those doing A-levels, because we've being doing assessments all the time and have a good idea of what we'll get"". Health and social care is one of the subjects seeing a surge in applications for next year, according to staff at Barking and Dagenham College in Essex. The rise in applications for courses include: health and social care, up 56% on last year electrical installation, up 15% finance, up 74% Barking and Dagenham student Antonela Rosewarne, 18, has just completed the first year of her Level 3 BTec in public services at the college, and thinks her best chance of getting her dream job in the fire service is to continue studying and do the second or ""extended"" year. Antonela went on a course team-building expedition before the pandemic At the start of lockdown, her tutors worked hard to put the course online as best they could. Some parts of it worked well, particularly the citizenship, psychology, criminology and diversity parts of the training. But the course also focuses on team building, communication and physical fitness, taught through team sports, trekking expeditions and gym work, and there was little the tutors could do apart from advising the students to keep up their fitness by walking or running. ""I was pretty stressed at first,"" she says. ""A lot of the course is practical, so I was worried about how it was going to go when we couldn't do the practical activities."" Why one in five university students hasn't done A-levels What will happen on A-level results day? She says that having missed out on so much of the practical side of the course ""dampens the achievement"", as teamwork and communication in particular ""are key skills for people wanting to work in the public services"". But despite coronavirus she is optimistic about the future: ""There's going to be a lot of changes with Covid-19, but I'm excited to meet new people and do new things."" Do you have a question about your results? Send your questions toyourquestions@bbc.co.uk,external Please read ourterms & conditionsandprivacy policy BTecs are vocational courses designed to develop practical skills - subjects like business, sport, and health and social care are popular. They are awarded by a private organisation, the education and training company Pearson. About 20% of university students in England are accepted after studying only BTecs, and another 10% are accepted into higher education with a combination of A-levels and BTecs. They can be taken by any age group - in fact,most are taken by those over the age of 22,external, andresearch,externalby the Social Market Foundation found these qualifications were particularly popular among white working-class students. While England, Wales and Northern Ireland have BTecs, Scotland has its own Scottish Vocational Qualifications. There are other vocational qualifications available - such as City and Guilds and Cambridge Technicals offered by OCR - offering a wide range of courses. There are changes afoot in the world of vocational learning, with this September seeing the introduction of a new qualification in England - the Technical or T-level - in subjects such as accountancy, catering, finance, hair and beauty, and manufacturing. What will teenagers study for the new T-levels? T-level study to be worth three A-levels T-level courses will be available to students after GCSEs and be equivalent to three A-levels - with a starred distinction being the same as three As at A-level.

Do I have a right to know my child's results? And other questions,"A-level and GCSE students in England will be given grades estimated by their teachers, rather than by an algorithm, after a government U-turn. Experts Eddie Playfair and Catherine Sezen, senior policy managers at theAssociation of Colleges,,externalare answering your questions. Williamson 'incredibly sorry' for exam distress U-turn on A-levels and GCSEs as teacher grades used How have exam results been decided this year? Catherine Sezen and Eddie Playfair offer personalised advice on what to do next Now that we know that the grades predicted by teachers - also known as centre assessment grades, or CAGs for short - will stand, this means that there will be a five-point increase in A* grades and a 10-point increase in A grades or above. University courses may well be able to manage the increased demand for high tariff courses, particularly if there is a relaxation of the cap on growth - called the student number controls. Health Secretary Matthew Hancock has saidthe government is also considering lifting the cap on medical places. I'm so sorry you missed your firm offer. First of all it may be worth revisiting this with Durham in case the position has changed. Universities are working hard to honour the offers they've made, whether UK or international, and Covid-19 has disrupted education for students across the world. UK and international applicants are not really competing for the same places though, as the admissions and funding systems are different. For example, the removal of Student Number Controls means that many universities could now offer more places to their UK students, and this does not apply to international students. I'm afraid the triple lock system has been overtaken by events and your son's D will stand, since it is higher than the CAG. There may be some grounds for an appeal and it's worth discussing this with his college or school. There's no reason to expect that this year's higher-than-usual grades will impact the opportunities for next year's students. Universities will be aware of the different grade profiles in different years and are likely to adjust their offers and decision-making accordingly. If your daughter's offer has been confirmed this shouldn't be withdrawn. Students may have some opportunity to change their minds but confirmed offers should stand. The government's announcement thatit is considering lifting the cap on the number of medical student placesmay also help. As far we are aware, students awaiting their GCSE grades on Thursday will receive their CAG from their school or college - and students who received their A or AS-level results last Thursday will be reissued their CAG. If students' calculated grades were higher than the CAG, their calculated grade will stand. If you received results last Thursday, the best thing to do is to contact your school or college. If you are expecting results this week, your school or college should confirm the process. Schools and colleges have very thorough quality assurance systems in place to ensure that results are not biased. The grades given by teachers are moderated at department and centre level to ensure that they are as fair as possible. Pupils protesting outside Education Secretary Gavin Williamson's constituency office BTecs are structured very differently to A-levels, and so the approach to awarding them is also different. BTecs were not subject to the same statistical moderation process as A-levels. They comprise modular units that students complete and are assessed at regular stages during their course of study, so prior to March 2020, students had already ""banked"" graded units for their qualification. These formed part of the evidence used to award grades for the externally assessed units and the final overall qualification grade. If you have individual concerns about BTec or other technical and vocational qualifications, the best thing to do is to contact your school or college. Universities are used to dealing with fluctuations in numbers between years but at this stage it's impossible to tell whether the number of university places in 2021 will be affected at all. Students taking exams next summer will certainly have been impacted by the disruption this year - and of course further disruption can't be ruled out. There have been some adaptations made to assessment and content for 2021 but the assumption is that public exams will go ahead next summer - the public health situation permitting. If exams take place next year, the grading system should be more like a normal year, but there will be a case for some ""leniency"" to allow for disruption. You are absolutely right - this summer's Centre Assessed Grades are separate from the predicted grades used for UCAS or other purposes and they may not be the same. The process for producing CAGs was careful and rigorous, and was subjected to internal moderation. It is these CAGs and rankings which were submitted to awarding organisations as part of this summer's process. The ""calculated"" grades which were issued last week had been statistically adjusted resulting in 39% of them being downgraded. These have now mostly been superseded by the original CAGs where they are higher. It's been a bit of a rollercoaster - but no one will have lower A-level grades than they got last week and many will have higher grades. If your son has accepted this place and is happy with it he doesn't need to do anything more except perhaps confirm that decision with the university concerned. We can't give a legal opinion on that, but universities are doing their best to honour all the offers they made - including where a student's grade has now changed. They will need a few days to sort this out but they will have been helped by the lifting of student number controls which would have limited how many places they could fill. As far as we know, the autumn series is still going ahead so students will have the opportunity to take exams this autumn as well as next summer - so the ""resit"" option is still available where it makes sense. These are questions which should be raised directly with the IB Organisation. We know that Ofqual has asked it to scrutinise the grades awarded this summer to ensure they have been delivered in line with Ofqual's new process. I'm sure that receiving universities will want to be as flexible and helpful in responding to candidates with IB Diplomas as they were with A-level candidates. We gather that there have been some delays with some BTec awards and we know that Pearson - the company which runs BTecs - is working to resolve this. We think that only 0.5% of BTec centre assessed grades were adjusted downwards and it's not clear whether they will now be moved up. Will BTec students have their grades changed? Ofqual has just published an update on vocational and technical qualifications. Although calculated results have been issued for many vocational and technical qualifications, in only a very few cases has the same kind of statistical standardisation process of CAGs been used and so Monday's announcement shouldn't impact on the majority of vocational qualifications. You can findmore information on the Ofqual website.,externalIf you still have any questions about your result I would suggest that you speak to your school or college. It's possible that more students with Scottish Highers might have a small impact on places available in English universities, but the difference in scale between the two countries probably means this will not be significant overall. I am sure universities will want to honour the offers they've made. This was the year of the results without any exams being taken It's been clear from the start that unfortunately some private candidates would not be able to receive CAGs, and this is obviously far from ideal. It may be possible for them to progress on to the course they want if they can be assessed by the institution they wish to join. There is also the option of taking exams in the autumn which will result in grades which can be used for progression. You will need to discuss this with both your firm and insurance universities as soon as possible, now that you know that your CAG will be your final grade. Now that your son knows what his final grade is, he should discuss this with both his first choice university and also with the university he applied to through clearing. Calculated grades were higher than CAGs for 2.3% of all entries, and these will be honoured. Yes, it is possible to accept an offer and take the exam. Your school or college will be able to advise you on the best option. If your son or daughter is 18 then the college cannot share information with you unless your child agrees, as they are now classified as an adult. They should be able to tell you how results will be sent out, or whether your son or daughter can collect them from the college. The college will be able to provide information, advice and guidance to your son or daughter to help them think about next steps. This might help as the basis of a chat with your child. The best thing to do is to ask the university how long they will keep the place open while you weigh up the options. Universities are being very flexible this year. The alternative offer from your firm choice, including a foundation year, is of course an extra year. If you really want to go to that university it is a good option, but the other university course may also be right for you. Give the university a call and then you will know how long you have got to consider both. Your daughter might get results if the school or college that was going to enter her had sufficient evidence (course work for example) to give her a centre assessed grade. If not there will be an opportunity for your daughter to take an exam in the autumn. The school or college will have more details about that. You need to discuss this with the college or school you attended in 2019-20 to consider the various options open to you. Simply repeating a year is not generally recommended unless there are exceptional circumstances - but of course 2020 has been pretty exceptional! If you have the possibility of progressing to a higher level - for example university - that might be the best option, but don't make any final decisions without getting support and advice from your college or school first. When producing CAGs, centres will have predicted how a student would have performed assuming they had received all the additional support and access arrangements which they require because of a disability. Hopefully, any mock processes would also have included that additional support and this is definitely worth discussing with your centre. The system this year was designed to make sure that the class of 2020 was not disadvantaged, and to produce outcomes which are broadly similar to previous years. So we expect the national grade profile to reflect this. This should provide reassurance for employers, universities and colleges that this year's grades have an equivalent value to those of previous years. How can I find a new job? The autumn exams are an opportunity for students entered this summer to take an exam. The grade they are awarded will have equal value and so this can inform any applications they are making to university in 2021. The current plan is for exams next summer to go ahead as normal, with a few alterations, and they should be seen as equivalent to any other year. In the future this is certainly worth exploring, but given the timeframe this year it would have been very difficult to ensure that all students would have been adequately prepared to undertake exams online. Not all students will have had appropriate equipment or spaces to undertake exams. Do you have a question about your exam results? Use the form to send it to us.

France to be added to UK quarantine countries,"This video can not be played Transport Secretary Grant Shapps explains decision behind France quarantine rules Thousands of holidaymakers have seen their plans thrown into chaos after UK quarantine measures were imposed on France from Saturday. The 14-day isolation requirement from 04:00 BST also now applies to people arriving from the Netherlands, Monaco, Malta, Turks and Caicos, and Aruba. It comes after France's prime minister acknowledged infection numbers were going ""the wrong way"". France warned it would take ""reciprocal measures"". Clement Beaune, France's secretary of state for European affairs,tweeted that the UK's decision was a matter of ""regret"" for the French,external. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the decision was triggered when the rate of infection in the affected countries exceeded 20 cases per 100,000 people over seven days. The quarantine requirement was previously applied to Spain, another popular destination for UK holidaymakers, at the end of July. ""We've worked so hard in this country to get our level of infections down, the last thing we want do is to have people returning and bringing the infection with them. It's to protect everybody,"" Mr Shapps told BBC Breakfast. There are about 160,000 British holidaymakers currently in France, he said. The deadline is expected to induce a rush to ports and airports, with thousands of tourists desperate to avoid quarantine. I'm in France right now - what do I do? Lockdown to ease further in England from Saturday European countries fight coronavirus surge Where are the world's coronavirus hotspots? Others who cannot return in time face disruption to work or schooling. Katie, a teacher on holiday in the south of France, told the BBC that the 12-hour drive to the Channel crossing means she has no chance to return in time, so she and her children will miss the start of term. ""We have done everything the government has asked of us for months but I really think they need to treat us all with a little respect and give us time to organise ourselves so that we can continue with our jobs, and our children with their lives,"" she said. Eurotunnel said its Channel Tunnel trains were fully booked until Saturday. Earlier, customers had faced long queues to access the website. Mariana Fabricante, who is trying to return from the mountain resort of Tignes with her family, said: ""Every time I try to change the ticket, the website is busy. People would be able to make informed decisions if they had been told in advance. It's annoying and frustrating."" John Keefe, director of public affairs at Getlink, which operates the Channel Tunnel,warned people not to travel to the terminal without a confirmed booking. ""There is no space available,"" he said. Eurostar passengers arriving at St Pancras, having beaten the quarantine deadline Prices of some flights to the UK from Paris were more than Â£450, compared to Â£66 on Saturday. Many direct flights from the south of France are sold out. The cheapest Eurostar tickets were Â£210, compared with Â£165 on Saturday. But DFDS Ferries said it had added an extra four departures from Calais to help Britons return in time. It said bookings must be made before arriving at port. Some holidaymakers said they would accept the quarantine restrictions on their return instead. Jonathan Fieldsend from Woodbridge in Suffolk, who is not due to return from France with his family until 18 August, said: ""We came fully accepting the risk we were taking of quarantine being introduced. We are not going to be rushing back."" Airlines UK described the quarantine restrictions as ""another devastating blow to the travel industry already reeling from the worst crisis in its history"". The UK's ambassador to France, Lord Llewellyn,acknowledged that the new quarantine rule would be ""unwelcome news"" for Britons in the country,external, but stressed that people could continue with their holidays as long as they follow safety precautions and self-isolate on their return. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said while the Labour party supports ""evidence based measures"" at the border, it was ""vital"" that No 10 had a ""joined-up strategy"" and ""urgently"" puts in place a specific deal to support the heavily impacted travel sector. The MP added: ""That the government has still not put in place an effective track, trace and isolate system has made matters far worse and made it more likely that we are reliant on the blunt tool of 14-day quarantine."" He called on Downing Street to publish science behind its decisions, ""and details of any work being done to reduce the time needed to isolate through increased testing and other measures"".

The Foreign Office is now warning against ""all but essential travel"" to France - the quarantine measure was imposed for Spain on 25 July. A list of more than 50 so-called travel corridors - allowing movement between the UK and the other countries without the need to self-isolate on return - waspublished at the start of last monthand later expanded. But the ending of some of the exemptions on the list follows a ""significant change"" in the risk of contracting Covid-19, the Department for Transport said. It added that there had been a 66% increaseâ¯in newly reported cases per 100,000 people in France since last Friday. For the Netherlands, it was up 52%. And the increase for Malta was 105%, while it was 273% for Turks and Caicos and 1,106% for Aruba. Ahead of a government meeting on the new measures, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised to be ""absolutely ruthless"" in deciding on rules for holidaymakers from abroad. ""We can't be remotely complacent about our own situation. Everybody understands that in a pandemic you don't allow our population to be re-infected or the disease to come back in,"" he added.

Fortnite sues Apple over App Store ban,"Apple has removed Fortnite from its App Store, preventing players from installing one of the world's most popular games on iPhones. It came after a Fortnite update that let players buy in-game currency at a lower rate if they bought direct from maker Epic Games - bypassing Apple. Epic appeared to know the ban would come, announcing it had filed a legal complaint minutes after the removal. Apple takes a standard 30% cut of sales from its compulsory payment system. Hours later, Google also appeared to remove the app from its Google Play Store - though it remains available on Android phones through other means, such as Epic Games' own launcher. Epic promised cheaper in-game items if players bypassed Apple's payments On iOS, the App Store is the only way to legitimately load apps. But Apple said Epic had taken the ""unfortunate step of violating the App Store guidelines"". Those guidelines ban any payment system apart from Apple's own, and has been the subject of several high-profile rows between developers and Apple. Epic said any iPhone players who already have the app installed should be able to continue playing until the game's next update rolls out. After that, they will lose some features. Those on an Apple Mac computer will not be affected, since that version does not use the iOS App Store. In addition to tweeting the legal complaint it filed in a California court, Epic also announced the imminent in-game screening of a short film titled Nineteen Eighty-Fortnite - a play on George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. The novel is about a dystopian society that controls its citizens and tolerates no dissent - and was itself referenced by Apple in a famous television ad in the year 1984, when the young company styled itself as taking on then-dominant IBM.

You may want to readGoogleâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Epic Games directly referenced that advertisement in its legal complaint,external, writing: ""Apple has become what it once railed against: the behemoth seeking to control markets, block competition, and stifle innovation."" The court documents allege that Apple effectively runs a monopoly in both deciding what apps can appear on iPhones and demanding its own payment system - with the relatively high 30% cut - is used. Piers Harding-Rolls, games research director at Ampere Analysis, said Epic's update breaking the rules ""was done to make Apple remove the app"". ""Removing Fortnite from the App Store helps to deliver a groundswell of support for Epic, something it is trying to achieve."" And he added that iPhones are not the biggest platform for Fortnite, but Epic will still notice its ban - the iOS version ""generates tens of millions of dollars in revenue every month on Apple platforms"", he said. Developers really, really don't like this charge. For many, a 30% cut of profits is akin to a shakedown. Last month, one app developer likened Apple to the mafia. The criticism is essentially an anti-competition one. Apple and Google run the operating systems of pretty much all of the phones in the world. That means they get to choose who can run apps on their stores, and who can't. They also get to set the charges. This is duopoly, say some developers. Apple claims 'half a trillion dollars' app economy Apple digs in over its App Store fees In Epic Games though, Apple has an unwanted foe. Fortnite is ludicrously profitable, Epic Games has the money to take Apple on. And the way this has been done - passing the savings on the consumer - is clearly tactical. Epic Games wants to take this fight out into the open. And with the EU and US Congress looking closely at Apple's business practices, this is attention the company could do without. In its court filing, Epic said it was not seeking financial compensation. ""Epic is seeking injunctive relief to allow fair competition in these two key markets that directly affect hundreds of millions of consumers and tens of thousands, if not more, of third-party app developers,"" it said. The documents also hint at a possible larger goal. This video can not be played Jaden âWolfiezâ Ashman became the youngest esports player ever to win a million dollars ""But for Apple's illegal restraints, Epic would provide a competing app store on iOS devices,"" it says. Epic Games has already attempted to disrupt the PC gaming market with the launch of its Epic Games Store, taking on the dominant player, Steam, in an attempt to lure players away with free games, which have often been popular, top-rated titles. Piers Harding-Rolls said the row is reminiscent of that challenge - Epic's store charges game developers 12% on PC games, compared to Steam's 30%. ""Apple and Google have been a long term target of Epic CEO Tim Sweeney's ire, as he believes the 30% revenue share they charge for app sales and in-game monetisation is too high,"" he said. ""However, taking on Apple is a different challenge than in the PC market as it's impossible to build a third-party storefront on iOS, or monetise apps outside of the App Store."" Google's Android system also uses Google's payment system for app store purchases, from which Google takes a cut - but Android allows developers to point users to other payment options. In a statement, Apple said the rules were applied equally to every developer, and that Epic had updated their game ""with the express intent of violating the App Store guidelines"". ""Epic has had apps on the App Store for a decade, and have benefited from the App Store ecosystem,"" it said. ""The fact that their business interests now lead them to push for a special arrangement does not change the fact that these guidelines create a level playing field for all developers and make the store safe for all users."" It added that it would try to work with Epic to bring Fortnite back.

Education secretary survives no-confidence vote,"John Swinney has apologised for the anguish caused by the grades controversy Education Secretary John Swinney has survived a no-confidence vote at Holyrood over the school results row. The Conservatives, Labour and the Lib Dems called for his resignation after thousands of teacher estimates of grades were initially marked down. But Mr Swinney's U-turn on the issue was enough for the Scottish Greens to back the SNP in the vote. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said Mr Swinney was ""one of the most decent and dedicated people in Scottish politics"". The motion, tabled by Labour, was defeated by 67 votes to 58. How did Swinney survive the school results row? This year's grades were based on teacher assessments because exams were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. When the results were published last week 125,000 of those estimates were downgraded by the Scottish Qualifications Authority, which said it wanted to ensure the results were comparable with previous years. But there were claims this system unfairly penalised pupils at schools which had historically not performed so well. On Tuesday, after an outcry and protests by students, Mr Swinney apologised and said he would direct the SQA to reissue grades ""based solely on teacher or lecturer judgement"". Nicola Sturgeon said Mr Swinney was ""one of the most decent and dedicated people in Scottish politics"" Leading the debate at Holyrood, Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard said Mr Swinney ""only jumped to action when his own job was on the line"". He said the education secretary had presided over a series of failures, and that that the ""fiasco"" over exam results ""must be his last"". Scottish Conservative group leader Ruth Davidson said there had been ""repeated warnings"" about the exams moderation issue, saying Mr Swinney ""could see the car crash coming and didn't act"". She said leadership ""means taking ultimate responsibility for failings in your brief"", adding: ""This failure is so great it demands a resignation"". And Scottish Lib Dem leader Willie Rennie said the education secretary had made a ""massive error of judgement"" and had ""undermined"" his department, saying: ""John Swinney knows in his quieter moments that he should go."" Opposition parties needed the votes of the Greens to pass the motion, but the party had already said they would not support it. MSP Ross Greer said he had warned for months about the ""fundamentally broken nature of the assessment system"", saying ""it should never, ever have been put into operation"" - but said among opposition parties ""only the Greens were actually interested in actually fixing the problem"". Ms Sturgeon, defending Mr Swinney, said he was ""probably the most honourable individual I have known in my life"". She said that when the education secretary got something wrong ""he has the humility to say so"" - and that he had fixed the problem while there was ""no comprehensive solution in England"" to a similar row over A-level results. The Greens (who have an affinity with the SNP over independence) demanded a high price for their support - a dramatic and complete u-turn on exam results from the Scottish government. Mr Swinney acceded to all their demands by cancelling 125,000 downgrades, allowing upgraded students to keep their awards, ordering an independent review into the debacle and promising a wider look at the best way to assess pupil performance. That amounts to the most spectacular change of policy by any minister, in any Scottish administration, in the short history of devolution since 1999. Throughout all of this, Mr Swinney has retained the confidence and support of the first minister, Nicola Sturgeon, who relies on him heavily. As her chosen deputy in government, he is a close and trusted ally and one of her most experienced ministers. Not someone she would want to lose or could easily replace.

Teenage murderer named as judge lifts restrictions,"Price previously could not be named due to reporting restrictions The 17-year-old boy convicted of murdering teaching assistant Lindsay Birbeck has been named as Rocky Marciano Price. The 47-year-old mother-of-two's body was found in a shallow grave in Accrington Cemetery two weeks after she went missing while walking in 2019. Price, who previously could not be named due to reporting restrictions,was found guilty of her murderat Preston Crown Court on Wednesday. He will be sentenced on Friday. Trial judge Mrs Justice Yip ruled the public interest in knowing Price's identity outweighed concerns over his welfare. ""This was a dreadful crime which understandably generated strong public interest,"" she said. ""The public will naturally want to know who this person was as they come to terms with something that rocked the local community."" This video can not be played Police released CCTV footage of Price as part of an appeal for information Price had admitted moving Mrs Birbeck's body in a wheelie bin, but had claimed he buried her for a stranger who had promised him money. His parents, Creddy, 47, and Martina, 39, took him to a local police station after a CCTV clip used by police in an appeal showed a young male pulling the wheelie bin on Burnley Road. His conviction came a year to the day that Mrs Birbeck went missing. The trial heard Price had no previous convictions or cautions and had lived all his life with his parents and at their home off Whinney Hill Road, near the cemetery, where several members of his family had been laid to rest. The court heard he was an exceptionally quiet teenager with learning difficulties who attended a local specialist school after he was diagnosed with autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It can also now be reported that Price faced two trials, as an initial case was halted in March. It was stopped after an unconnected police investigation into false imprisonment found mobile phone footage of a man claiming he was involved in Mrs Birbeck's murder and the disposal of her body. Price's defence team successfully argued that the jury should be discharged on the basis he could not receive a fair trial and they needed time to explore the footage. At the time, Mrs Justice Yip said it was ""unusual and unfortunate that the evidence has emerged during the trial"", adding that if the case had continued, the matter ""would have been pursued to the Court of Appeal on grounds of possible fresh evidence"". An investigation by more than 20 police officers later concluded that the information in the footage was false, allowing a second trial to proceed.

Three hurt in blast at St Ives waterfront bar,"Police, ambulance and fire crew attended Three people have been hurt in a kitchen explosion at a bar on the waterfront in St Ives. A member of staff has been airlifted to hospital following the blast at the Balcony Bar and Kitchen in Wharf Road. Police said one person had ""potentially serious burns"". Two other members of staff were also injured, but none of the diners in the bar was hurt. One witness described hearing an explosion then seeing ""a massive plume of smoke"" at the popular tourist spot. It happened at about 15:20 BST. The harbour front was temporarily closed by emergency services but has since reopened. Firefighters said they discovered an ""industrial fryer unit"" inside the property and used a hose reel jet and thermal imaging camera to extinguish the fire. A member of kitchen staff was taken to hospital by air ambulance with ""potentially serious burns"" John Chard told the BBC he was on his boat when he witnessed ""what appeared to be some sort of explosion"".

Nick Cave compares cancel culture to 'bad religion',"Nick Cave has said cancel culture is akin to ""bad religion run amuck"". Writing on his website, the Australian rock star suggested that political correctness has an ""asphyxiating effect on the creative soul of a society"". ""Cancel culture"" is the term for when individuals or companies face swift public backlash and boycott over statements or actions perceived by some as offensive. It ""embodies all the worst aspects that religion has to offer"", said Cave. Answering a question from a fan, in the latest of hisRed Hand Files series,externalof correspondences, the 62-year-old wrote: ""As far as I can see, cancel culture is mercy's antithesis. Political correctness has grown to become the unhappiest religion in the world. ""Its once honourable attempt to reimagine our society in a more equitable way now embodies all the worst aspects that religion has to offer (and none of the beauty) - moral certainty and self-righteousness shorn even of the capacity for redemption. It has become quite literally, bad religion run amuck. Cancel culture: What unites young people against Obama and Trump Nick Cave performing for fans at Glastonbury Festival in 2013 ""Cancel culture's refusal to engage with uncomfortable ideas has an asphyxiating effect on the creative soul of a society."" He added: ""Compassion is the primary experience - the heart event - out of which emerges the genius and generosity of the imagination."" Cave has previously used the platform to answer questions from fans on a range of topics, including  his break-up with PJ Harvey, the death of his teenage son Arthur, and how to deal with writer's block. In the latest one, entitled ""What do you think of cancel culture?"" - apparently a question from a fan in America - he went on to say that ""creativity is an act of love that can knock up against our most foundational beliefs, and in doing so brings forth fresh ways of seeing the world."" ""This is both the function and glory of art and ideas,"" he continued. ""A force that finds its meaning in the cancellation of these difficult ideas hampers the creative spirit of a society and strikes at the complex and diverse nature of its culture. ""But this is where we are. We are a culture in transition, and it may be that we are heading toward a more equal society - I don't know - but what essential values will we forfeit in the process?"" Many people, includingcomic actor Ricky Gervais,external, appear to agree with the Red Right Hand singer about cancel culture, going as far to say that it is a potential threat to free speech. Lots of others, however, do not, and view political correctness as a force for good. In response to Cave's musings, music journalistOsman Faruqi posted,externalthat he ""would love to know what the 'uncomfortable ideas' are that Nick Cave wants to grapple with but apparently can't because of cancel culture"". Another music journalist, Shaun Curran, felt Cave made ""a fundamental mistake"" in thinking cancel culture is specifically and only targeted at the art itself. ""That's the case sometimes,""tweeted Curran,external. ""But I'd say the majority of it is actually about the behaviour of the artist which he doesn't seem to grasp"". He pointed to Michaela Coel's recent comedy-drama show I May Destroy You as an example of ""challenging art"". Artist and photographer Alex Boyd applauded Cave's sentiments, however. ""I can hear the fingers of the neo-puritans striking their keyboards in rage,""he tweeted,external. ""Tonight Nick Cave shall be cancelled for cancelling cancel culture,"" he joked. JK Rowling joins warning over free speech In July, some 150 writers, academics and activists - including authors JK Rowling, Salman Rushdie and Margaret Atwood - signed an open letter denouncing the ""restriction of debate"".

"Anger over 'unfair' A-level resultsThere are calls for a review and free appeals as concern grows over ""volatility"" in this year's results.","This year's exams were cancelled because of the Covid-19 pandemic There is anger among schools, colleges and students, after nearly 40% of A-level grades awarded on Thursday were lower than teachers' predictions. In England, 36% of entries had a lower grade than teachers predicted and 3% were down two grades, in results after exams were cancelled by the pandemic. School and college leaders are calling for a review and say all fees for appeals should be waived. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the results were a ""robust set of grades"". The overall results, across England, Northern Ireland and Wales, show record highs for A* and A grades. But David Hughes, chief executive of the Association of Colleges, said he had heard from a number of colleges where more than half of their school-assessment grades have been adjusted downwards following moderation. Paul Whiteman leader of the heads' union  NAHT said: ""The government must make sure that there is no financial barrier to a school or college making an appeal."" Geoff Barton, leader of the ASCL head teachers' union said: ""While there had been an overall increase in top grades, there was a ""great deal of volatility among the results at school and student level."" He said students felt grades had been pulled down ""in a way that they feel to be utterly unfair and unfathomable"". This video can not be played How does the class of 2020 feel about finishing college during a pandemic? He called on the government and exams watchdog Ofqual to review the moderation process in England ""as a matter of urgency"". ""We would warn them against simply digging in their heels, and insisting all is well. ""This results day must have been an absolute nightmare for many schools, colleges, and young people - it is a shambles."" For the top  A* and A grades, independent schools in England saw the greatest improvement on last year - up 4.7 percentage points. This compares with a 1.7, 2 and 0.3 percentage points improvement for top grades for England's academies, comprehensives and colleges respectively. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said pupils would be able to sit exams if they feel they could have done better. ""Where pupils are disappointed, where they feel that they could have done better, where they feel that there's an injustice been done to them, there is the possibility of appeal and they can re-sit, they can take a re-sit this autumn as well."" What's next in the arguments over exam results? A third of NI A-level grades lower than predicted 'Unfair' A-level results claim as grades lowered Will the exam 'triple lock' affect me? And other questions ""But looking at the big picture, I think overall we've got a very robust set of grades, plus you've got the situation in which more pupils than ever before are getting their first choice course at university and more kids from disadvantaged backgrounds going to university."" Education Secretary Gavin Williamson said the ""majority of young people will have received a calculated grade today that enables them to progress to the destination they deserve, with the added safety net of being able to appeal on the basis of their mock results, as well as the chance of sitting autumn exams"". But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""Something has obviously gone horribly wrong with this year's exam results. ""Nearly 40% of young people have had their grades marked down and that's thousands of young people whose opportunities could have been dashed."" Many students went back into school or college to receive their results The exam results show: for A-levels: 9% of entries were A* (up from 7.8% in 2019) 27.9% were A* and A (up from 25.5% in 2019) these are the highest ever levels of A* and As - up from a previous high of 27% in 2011 78.4% of entries were A*-C (up from 75.8% in 2019) Psychology now the second most popular subject, after maths girls outperform boys, except in A*s in England, the moderation means that 36% of results have been lowered by one grade, 3% by two grades, 2% have increased there will be 25,000 university courses available in clearing, including 4,500 in top Russell Group universities for vocational qualifications, the Department for Education says results ""broadly in line with previous years"" The proportion of entries getting an A* or A grade is at a record high this year - with the 27.9% above the previous highest of 27% in 2011. And there are increases in those getting A* to C - as the exam regulator had promised a more lenient approach. At Wilberforce Sixth Form College in Hull, while some students were celebrating, others were very disappointed. Abbi is one of those students who is not happy with her results, saying she had missed out on her place at Durham University to study engineering. She said she would now have to consider retakes or finding a clearing place at another university. ""It seems like some unfair grading. When I opened them I had a bit of a cry,"" she told the BBC. Abbi's grades mean she has missed out on a place to study engineering at Durham University ""My future has been set back completely,"" she said. ""I had my heart set on Durham and it's now not an option for clearing because there's no clearing for my course."" ""I would have happily sat the exams but it was up to the government,"" she said, adding that she was angry her results had been affected by something out of her control. BTec students 'hopeful for the future' Students warn that using mocks 'makes mockery' of exams Exam rituals put on hold this year In Wales students promised no A-levels lower than AS-level grades Scottish pupils to have exam results upgraded Principal Colin Peaks said he had never seen ""such a negative feeling"" on results day in all his years of teaching. Mr Peaks said there was ""something worrying across the board"", with many good students not getting the grades they would have expected. ""The anomalies within the system aren't right - I'm seeing anomalies across the piece that do not make sense to me."" He said basing results, in part, on last year's students' results was wrong because ""they're different"". ""We are going to see lots of appeals,"" he added. Students taking vocational exams have been getting estimated results over recent weeks - with more than 250,000 receiving their grades in BTec and Cambridge Technical qualifications which are equivalent to A-levels and strong GCSE passes. The Department for Education says vocational results are ""broadly in line with previous years"". Brenda Irabor from Ark Academy in Brixton, south London, achieved three A* grades Figures from the admissions service, Ucas, show that more students have been accepted onto UK degree courses this year. Among UK applicants, 358,860 have been accepted - a 2.9% rise compared with 2019. Of these, 316,730 have been accepted on to their first choice, up 2.7% on the same point last year. Clearing is an increasingly popular route for students to find a degree course, with leading universities among those offering last-minute places through the system, Ucas said. By Sean Coughlan, education correspondent This is a strange year for A-level results in every way, with grades arriving for exams that were never taken. In more usual times the headlines would have been about this being a record year for top grades - with almost 28% getting A*s or As. But instead this has been an exam results day full of uncertainty, with head teachers warning about volatility below the surface of rising grades. Almost two out of every five results were lower than the grades predicted by their teachers - and heads are warning of a confusing pattern of where results have gone down. But, at the same time, those trying to get to university might find that they're able to get in with lower grades than in previous years, with the promise of ""super-flexible"" admissions. The confusion extends to what happens next. Because for those getting bad news today, it could still be good news through the appeals process. Have you got your A-level or BTec results today?

Thunderstorms and flash floods after hot weather,"A woman shields from rain on Oxford Street in London Thunderstorms are moving across parts of the UK, after some areas saw the longest stretch of high temperatures since the 1960s. The severe weather caused flash floods in parts of southern England on Thursday, bringing travel disruption. The Met Office has issued yellow thunderstorm warnings for the next five days in much of England and Wales, with flooding, lightning and hail expected. It comes after torrential rain and lightninglashed parts of Scotland. Part of the M25 motorway in Surrey was closed because of flash flooding, while in Kent 19 people have been evacuated from a train which became stuck after a landslide. A motorist recorded footage of some of the flooding on the M25 The motorway is closed completely between two junctions in Surrey The Met Office has warned that while some areas could stay dry, others could see as much as 40mm of rain falling in less than an hour amid severe thunderstorms. There were thundery showers across southern England on Thursday afternoon, including the counties between Devon and Kent. This video can not be played Why are we having so many thunderstorms? BBC Weather said about 12,000 lightning strikes were detected across parts of southern Britain in the hours leading up to 18:00 BST. A wooden pavilion caught fire after a suspected lightning strike in the village of Barton Stacey in Hampshire, with eyewitness Donna Stokes saying there was a ""horrendously loud bang of thunder"". ""The pavilion has been on the playing fields for somewhere in the region of 80 years,"" said Donna In Devon, homes were flooded following a collection of thunderstorms across south-west England on Thursday. Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service said on Twitter it had received numerous calls relating to properties in Devon, with some residents reporting up to 18 inches of water inside their homes.

'Unfair' A-level results claim as grades loweredRecord A-level results are reported but unions say there is a real concern at grades for some pupils.,"This video can not be played Bradley Desmier was predicted a B, C and a merit but got a D, E and a pass A-level results day in Wales has been overshadowed by claims that results for some pupils are ""utterly unfair and unfathomable"". Top grades have risen despite a chaotic summer when exams were cancelled. But more than 42% of final grades were lowered from those estimated by teachers, after the exams watchdog called them ""too generous"". The education minister has pledgedgrades would be no lower than pupils' earlier AS results. Up to 4,500 may now be given improved grades, which exam board officials have promised to do as soon as possible. There has still been strong criticism by teaching unions and some head teachers, who claim pupils were being ""short changed"" and the calculations had placed an over-emphasis on last year's AS-levels. One further education organisation has called for a review of the process. But Education Minister Kirsty Williams said she was confident the system was fair and ""very robust"". ""In any year under normal circumstances, sometimes the grades of a student... do not meet the expectations of maybe the teacher, or maybe the student and that's not different this year,"" she said. ""Clearly, I wish we had not been in a position to make last-minute changes but [students] can be absolutely confident that the exams that they have achieved today are as good as exams that were taken last year."" A pupil from Swansea looks at her results, a situation experienced by thousands around Wales How it happened: Students receive their coronavirus-hit A-level results Heads warn of 'unfair' grades for A-level students The late intervention by Ms Williams on Wednesday followed an outcry in Scotland after thousands of results were initially downgraded,sparking changes in other parts of the UK. WJEC chief executive, Ian Morgan, said he thought the system had been ""fair and balanced."" ""We probably looked at a dozen different models and it was felt, from a WJEC perspective, and signed off by Qualifications Wales, that the approach we took was the fairest in the circumstances,"" he said. Mr Morgan said there would ""inevitably"" be appeals. ""It's about ensuring that we are fair and consistent in that appeals process,"" he said. He said his organisation had done ""the best that we possibly can in the circumstances."" A record proportion of A and A* grades - 29.9%, up 2.9 percentage points from 2019. But this is less than the 40.4% estimated after the initial teacher assessments 42.2% of final A-level grades are lower than the predicted grades based on assessment, 53.7% are the same and 4.1% are higher The proportion achieving A* is 10.8% - adjusted downwards from the original estimate of 15.4% More pupils on free school meals saw their A-levels downgraded - 48.1%, compared to 45.3% for pupils not eligible 98.6% achieved passes A*-E, up 1% on 2019 The gap between boys and girls is slightly wider than last year - with A* to C grades for 76.5% of boys and 82.3% of girls 22.2% achieved an A* or A for AS-levels, up 1.9 percentage points from last year. Education Minister Kirsty Williams meets students at Merthyr College The qualifications watchdog found that the estimated grades by teachers had been too generous in Wales. If you look at the last 10 years, usually about a quarter of grades are at the very top -last year it was around 27%, when record numbers of pupils got A and A*s. But Qualifications Wales found if it had gone along with the estimates for this summer then more than 40% would have been A and A* grades. Results day rituals put on hold How will I get my exam results this year? Following the revision, the majority of students (53.7%) have been given their original assessment grade while the remainder (42.2%) get a lower grade. A small proportion get a higher grade. Altogether, 37% were downgraded by a single grade and 5% were dropped two grades. But once ministers in England and Scotland had stepped in to overrule the usual exam moderation practices it was inevitable that Wales would have to follow suit. Students who get their grades today are being told if their results are lower than their earlier AS-level grades, they will be issued with revised ones by the WJEC as soon as possible. Student's 'terrifying experience' during pandemic Paralympic ambitions for injured horse-riding teen Student's grief and Ramadan in lockdown Education expert Gareth Evans, from the University of Wales Trinity Saint David, said some students would still wonder if they might have performed better than expected. ""While it will doubtless be of some comfort to those who performed well at the halfway stage of their A-levels, it will be of scant consolation to those pinning their hopes on boosting scores at the end of the course,"" he said. ""Issues with the artificial moderation of grades allocated by teachers remains. The right of pupils to challenge their grades as appropriate is absolutely essential."" Eithne Hughes, director of theÂ ASCL Cymru union said:  ""We have received many calls from school leaders expressing their frustration, confusion, and disappointment at the results awarded to their students. ""They report that grades have been pulled down in a way that they feel to be utterly unfair and unfathomable, and they are extremely concerned about the detrimental impact on the young people concerned.""Â Â Neil Foden, a north Wales-based member of the national executive of the National Education Union, said that from his contact with schools, more than 90% of headteachers were unhappy with the grades. ""There is real concern in schools about the number of learners whose results have been downgraded from the teacher estimates,"" he said. Dilwyn Roberts-Young, of Welsh teaching union Ucac, said: ""There remains serious concern that there are many discrepancies at individual and centre level, in spite of the education minister's pledge last night. ""The last-minute changes and the results of individuals are inevitably going to create anxiety and we hope we will not see this repeated next week."" Colegau Cymru - an education charity representing further education providers - has called for an urgent review of the awarding process. It said there had been ""considerable inequalities"" in the results of individual learners. Director of development Kelly Edwards said: ""We must ensure that the grades awarded are fair and accurate so that learners can progress on their chosen path."" Qualifications Wales chief executive Philip Blaker said this year's process had not disadvantaged particular groups of pupils and the grades were ""meaningful and robust"". ""We have analysed attainment gaps this year relative to previous years - looking at aspects such as gender, age and eligibility for free school meals"", he said. ""Our analysis shows no statistically significant differences this year relative to other years."" The results show Wales has proportionately more pupils with top grades and grades A* to C than in England, but fewer than in Northern Ireland. There had also been a 3.3% rise in the proportion of A* to C grades in Wales, higher than elsewhere. And the performance at both A* to C and A*-A grades in Wales is higher than in all regions of England, apart from the south east, which is only slightly higher. Sophie Price, 18, from Bassaleg, Newport, is aiming to start a fashion buying course in London but was told online that she did not have the right grades. ""I was freaking out, I didn't know what to do,"" she said.Â ""There's not a lot of guidance on what to do - you're just left there. You can't really ring them, you have to email them and then you're waiting for an email back.Â ""Quite a lot of people I know have got lower than they were predicted.Â  Lots of people have been predicted Cs and got Us."" Sophie passed her Welsh Bac and got a D in business and E in art; she was predicted two Cs. Her art mark will be upgraded because of her AS grade last year but she will now need to appeal against her business grade, although her university said it will keep her place open for now. ""I don't have a back-up plan - I was so set on the one thing.Â ""It's a bit heart-breaking, you don't really know what else to do.Â  It's hard when your future's in the hands of other people and you have no control over it."" Caitlyn Foley said she had a ""faint idea but it went better than I was expecting"" At Merthyr College, Caitlyn Foley got an A* and three As. ""It's been a bit weird having to deal with all the changes so last minute,"" she said. ""We thought the teacher's predicted grades were final but then we found out that there was a bit more than that,"" she said. ""Obviously the announcement last night that we wouldn't get less than what we got in AS, that was a bit reassuring."" Fellow student Tom Bush, who got an A and two Bs, added: ""I've actually got lower now than I had at AS in Psychology which is odd but hopefully I'll go up."" Zac Evans may appeal his design and technology grade Zac Evans, a pupil at Ysgol Glan Clwyd, St Asaph, said he got Cs in art, design and technology, and an E in PE. ""I'm going to look into an appeal with the hope of getting a higher grade in DT because I was hoping for a B but it will all be OK in the long run. ""I've just had advice from the headmaster and they'll be releasing how the application process works on Monday because they say it's changing and I'll be looking into it."" The Welsh Joint Education Committee (WJEC) in Cardiff is the main exam board and will handle appeals Qualifications Wales has been asked to quickly make any relevant adjustments to the appeals process and liaise with other exam regulators. The advice to pupils getting results is: If your A-level grade is the same or higher than your AS-level, then no action is required. If the grade is lower it will be replaced with the same grade as that received for the AS-level - and revised grades will be issued by WJEC as soon as possible. It is believed this could involve between 3,000 and 4,500 grades. If needed, students can contact their prospective university to advise them of the change. As things stand, appeals have to be made through a school or college, rather than direct to the WJEC exam board - and there are limited grounds. These are restricted to the process - such as the exam board using the wrong data to calculate a final grade. It will not allow schools and colleges to rethink their estimated grades or ranking of pupils. If other mistakes are highlighted through an appeal, the other pupils affected will not see their grades lowered, the exam board has said. Students pose for a photograph with their A-level results at Ffynone House School in Swansea Jackie Parker, head of Crickhowell School in Powys said: ""We will all be working to look through every individual child's performance data to look at what results they've achieved and to ensure if appeals are necessary they are going forward positively. ""I think the WJEC and others have tried to be as fair as they can but I personally think there's more work to do here. ""For me, the moral purpose of leadership is to ensure that our young people are not disadvantaged in any way."" Lisa Thomas, principal of Merthyr College, said it had been a very unsettling time and results would now be closely scrutinised. ""If we feel that there are learners that have been disadvantaged in any way then we would be looking to use the appeals process,"" she said. Exams were cancelled after schools were closed in March Is there a fair way to award grades without exams? Even exams can be unfair. Some of us perform badly under exam pressure, and two people marking the same paper can give different grades. But this year's assessment had left many people feeling their future chances have been harmed by a computer model. The awarding body put in place a system that led to more than 40% of grades being downgraded to stop grade inflation. But on the eve of results day thousands of students were rescued when the Welsh Government announced students that achieved higher AS grades are entitled to have their A-level result upgraded to match. Information available to calculate grades differs across the UK: like in Northern Ireland, AS results contribute to overall A-level results in Wales and therefore can be taken into account. However, this doesn't happen in England - where AS grades have no bearing to A-level results. Research suggests that using AS performance can improve the overall accuracy of grades. It still means that if a school has a stronger year group than last year, or if teaching has improved, that might not be fully recognised this year. Grades could be calculated using a range of evidence including work to date, mock exams and teacher assessed grades, but even experts can't agree on a perfect way to navigate yet another difficult problem caused by the coronavirus. There has been concern about how the ""standardisation"" process looks at schools and colleges' previous results. In Wales, this does not apply to the process for A-levels, the Welsh Bacc and some GCSEs where you already have a lot of hard data from previous assessment - such as AS-levels - to work from. But average results from 2017-19 are taken into account when standardising most GCSEs. Schools could appeal to the WJEC if they think there were significant circumstances or events in those previous years which might bring the average down. However, currently there is no scope for pupils to appeal against the grade they were given by their school or college - the Centre Assessment Grade (CAG). If pupils have concerns about bias or discrimination in allocating those grades, they can appeal to the WJEC and a process similar to a malpractice complaint would be followed, but those are expected to be rare. In other years there can be requests for exam scripts to be reviewed, but this is obviously not an option when no exams have been taken. The minister has announced, however, that the appeal process will be free for all students. Qualifications Wales has set a 17 September deadline for initial reviews andthen a 42-day deadline for appeals to be dealt with by the WJEC exam board,external. A further independent review is possible.

Student's grief and Ramadan in lockdown,"Athika, pictured with one of her teachers, says lockdown gave her the opportunity to grieve for her grandfather ""Losing my grandad before Covid, I used my studies to mask the pain but lockdown meant I had to grieve for him'"" says 18-year-old Athika Ahmed. Like many young people, the spread of coronavirus meant Athika's life changed instantly. From going to school to study her A-levels, she went to spending a lot of time in the house. ""The biggest thing that's changed for me is not having that consistency. The lack of schedule in my daily life and not going to school has been really difficult,"" she says. A-level pupils in Wales find out 'cancelled summer' results A-levels in Wales: Minister makes pledge on this year's grades Coronavirus: A-level results to arrive in year with no exams Without having that routine Athika, from Grangetown in Cardiff, found herself being quite lazy and not having the motivation to get up and be productive and felt that this has had an impact on her mental health. Athika Ahmed (right) celebrated Eid in May The routine that many young people find mundane and quite boring she found herself needing in order for her to feel like she could focus and push on through the months that she was in lockdown. Alongside dealing with the uncertainty of what was to come with her grades having been told she wasn't going to sit her exams, the Fitzalan High School pupil was also having to cope with observing Ramadan in lockdown. ""Ramadan is one of the most important months in the Islamic calendar, and I was worried about what it was going to be like during Covid and particularly in lockdown,"" Athika says. Athika with her friends For Athika and many other Muslims, it isn't just about not eating and drinking, but abstaining from bad habits, like swearing and being angry. It's a time to reflect. ""What was particularly difficult was going through that struggle of Ramadan, and not being able to celebrate, firstly on an evening, with friends and family as you open your fast together, and then at the end, celebrating Eid, after successfully fasting for the whole month,"" she says. This year's celebrations were low key, with immediate family living in the same household, which for Athika, was her mum, dad, and two sisters. She says: ""It was a small party, but we all got dressed up and made some food. It wasn't as exciting as normal with loads of dishes and people, but next year will be better."" With both Eids being celebrated in lockdown, it has been a difficult time for Muslims, but for Athika it hasn't been completely negative. Having nothing to do, and just her thoughts, the time in lockdown allowed Athika to process feelings about the death of her grandad. ""I never really had the time to grief for my grandad, or maybe it was just that I didn't want to, and chucked myself into my A-levels, studying and revising, but this time in lockdown has really allowed me come to terms with his loss,"" Athika says. Thinking about the current situation, the uncertainty of what was happening next with her studies, she realised that her grandad wouldn't want her worrying, but would want her to make the most of her life, and she did just that, volunteering to help others in her community. The volunteering has also allowed her to not get stressed about her A-level results. With students not sitting exams and marks being based on mock exams and teachers' grades, Athika had been nervous about what is going to happen. ""I tried hard in my mock so I feel happy that I did the best I could, but looking at what happened in Scotland and me not coming from an affluent area it does make me really worried about what is going to happen,"" she says. Despite being disappointed with her results, Athika managed to secure her place at university. And the Covid crisis has made her all the more determined to aspire to become a doctor. She says ""Covid has highlighted the importance of the NHS and how much I can do to help people during really difficult times like this.""

Paralympic ambitions for injured horse-riding teen,"The fall has not dented Leonie's confidence or desire to get back on a horse An ""incredibly inspiring"" student who completed her A-levels just months after a serious horse-riding accident hopes to compete at the Paralympics. Leonie Saffy, 18, from Ruabon, Wrexham, shattered her pelvis and hip and fractured a thigh bone in the fall. The Coleg Cambria student was left in a wheelchair but continued her studies online in lockdown, and now hopes to study biochemistry at Keele University. Leonie has been awarded a place on the British dressage development programme. ""The accident hasn't put me off riding, I've injured myself plenty of times over the years,"" said the former Ysgol Rhiwabon pupil, who also suffers with multiple pterygium syndrome, a rare genetic disorder. ""We still don't really know what happened during my fall - there was some bucking and a rear,"" she said. ""I lost my reins and came off and, luckily, I missed the fence, as that could have made the fall much worse. ""I couldn't move my legs, so mum called the ambulance."" Leonie shattered her pelvis and hip and fractured a thigh bone in the fall But the fall has not dented her confidence or desire to get back on a horse. ""Horse riding is a high-risk sport and it's something you have to be willing to risk if you want to participate in, especially at a higher level,"" Leonie explained. ""I have 20 screws and rods in my spine from a previous surgery due to multiple pterygium syndrome, so the worry was that I had snapped a spinal rod."" But a scan at Wrexham Maelor Hospital revealed her pelvis had taken the brunt of the fall rather than her back, and she was allowed home in a wheelchair after a week. Leonie has been awarded a place on the British dressage development programme On Thursday Leonie received her A-level results. She got an A in biology, a B in English language and literature, a C in chemistry, and an A in her Welsh baccalaureate. She now hopes to combine a degree in biochemistry with her place on the Podium Potential P3 dressage squad for Team GB, and pursue her dream of participating at the 2024 Paralympics in Paris. Leonie, who has been through a long period of recuperation from her injuries, said she was committed to achieving medals on the international stage while pursuing a career as a biochemist. Simon Woodward, head of sixth form at Coleg Cambria Yale, believes ""inspiring"" Leonie has a very bright future ahead of her.

Women form 'solidarity chains' in Belarus protests,"Many women have been wearing white as they protest against the disputed election result and police violence Women have formed human chains in Belarus to condemn a crackdown on protests as demonstrations over the disputed election entered a fifth day. Many dressed in white and carried flowers as they called for an end to police brutality. Unrest erupted after long-time leader Alexander Lukashenko was declared winner in a vote condemned by the EU and US as neither free nor fair. Thousands of people have been arrested and at least two have died. In the latest official figures, the interior ministry said police had detained 700 people during protests on Wednesday, bringing the total number to 6,700. Some detainees were released on Thursday. Tearful relatives gathered outside a jail north of the capital Minsk, hoping to be reunited with their loved ones or for information on their whereabouts. Several strikes have been reported at state-owned factories, where workers object to the violent treatment of protesters. Hundreds of employees were seen walking out at truck-maker Belaz, in Zhodino to the north-east of the capital. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Ms Tikhanovskaya, 37, released a video saying she made the ""very difficult decision"" to leave because of her children. This video can not be played Svetlana Tikhanovskaya: ""Not one life is worth what is happening now"" The opposition candidate was a stay-at-home mother until she entered the race after her husband was arrested and blocked from registering for the vote. She became Mr Lukashenko's toughest opposition challenge in years, leading large rallies in the lead up to the vote. But Mr Lukashenko dismissed her bid, saying a woman could not lead Belarus. ""Our constitution is not for women,"" he said earlier this year. ""Our society has not matured enough to vote for a woman. This is because by constitution the president handles a lot of power."" The stay-at-home mum challenging Belarus's longtime ruler Challenger fled Belarus 'for sake of her children' Nobel literature laureate Svetlana Alexievich accused the authorities of declaring war on their own people and urged Mr Lukashenko to stand down.

Medics walked out of hospitals for a second day to join the demonstrations and performers from the Belarusian State Philharmonic held up a message saying ""Philharmonia prays for the people"". Some of the performers covered their mouths with crosses to say their voices had been stolen Russian internet giant Yandex said armed individuals had entered two of its offices in Minsk and barred employees inside from leaving. They left some hours later. By Olga Ivshina, BBC Russian The body of evidence of police brutality, both in the streets and inside remand prisons, is mounting. Detainees include not only opposition activists, but also many journalists and accidental passers-by. One of the released journalists, Nikita Telizhenko of the Russian Znak.com news website, published a harrowing account of three days inside prison. Now back in Russia, he describes people lying on the floor of a detention centre, piled on top of each other, in a pool of blood and excrement. Not allowed to use the toilet for hours on end or even change position. He says he saw seriously injured people, with broken limbs and severe bruising, not only left without medical help, but kicked and beaten by the guards more. Telizhenko's testimony is confirmed by countless posts on social media - photos, videos, stories. I spoke to an American woman who was visiting her Belarusian boyfriend in Minsk - he got detained for no apparent reason. Not only had he not been protesting, but he was asleep in bed when the police came to his flat, kicked down the door and took him away. Election officials said Mr Lukashenko won 80% of the vote on Sunday, but protests erupted amid widespread allegations of vote rigging. Hundreds of people have been injured in a police crackdown on protests, some seriously. A BBC crew was attacked by police on Tuesday evening. Officials have confirmed the deaths of two people. One demonstrator died during a protest in the capital Minsk on Monday. The Belarusian interior ministry alleged an explosive device had gone off in his hand. Ambassadors from European countries laid flowers on Thursday where he died, a day before EU foreign ministers were due to consider imposing sanctions on Belarus. A 25-year-old man alsodied in the south-eastern city of Gomel. His mother told Radio Free Europe that her son had not taken part in any protests and was arrested as he was going to see his girlfriend. She said he had heart problems and was kept for hours in a police van. People have been shouting the words ""get out"" from their balconies, the same slogan used by protesters on the ground. Police responded by firing rubber bullets. The United Nations has condemned the use of violence by authorities. Video footage shared on social media has shown ex-special forces officers throwing their uniforms into bins in disgust at the actions of their former colleagues. ""I was proud of the unit I served [in]. Now I am ashamed. Shame on everyone who follows such orders,"" one former officer said.

"France to be added to UK quarantine countriesPeople arriving in the UK from France after 04:00 BST on Saturday will have to quarantine for 14 days, minister saysUK Politics","This video can not be played Transport Secretary Grant Shapps explains decision behind France quarantine rules Thousands of holidaymakers have seen their plans thrown into chaos after UK quarantine measures were imposed on France from Saturday. The 14-day isolation requirement from 04:00 BST also now applies to people arriving from the Netherlands, Monaco, Malta, Turks and Caicos, and Aruba. It comes after France's prime minister acknowledged infection numbers were going ""the wrong way"". France warned it would take ""reciprocal measures"". Clement Beaune, France's secretary of state for European affairs,tweeted that the UK's decision was a matter of ""regret"" for the French,external. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the decision was triggered when the rate of infection in the affected countries exceeded 20 cases per 100,000 people over seven days. The quarantine requirement was previously applied to Spain, another popular destination for UK holidaymakers, at the end of July. ""We've worked so hard in this country to get our level of infections down, the last thing we want do is to have people returning and bringing the infection with them. It's to protect everybody,"" Mr Shapps told BBC Breakfast. There are about 160,000 British holidaymakers currently in France, he said. The deadline is expected to induce a rush to ports and airports, with thousands of tourists desperate to avoid quarantine. I'm in France right now - what do I do? Lockdown to ease further in England from Saturday European countries fight coronavirus surge Where are the world's coronavirus hotspots? Others who cannot return in time face disruption to work or schooling. Katie, a teacher on holiday in the south of France, told the BBC that the 12-hour drive to the Channel crossing means she has no chance to return in time, so she and her children will miss the start of term. ""We have done everything the government has asked of us for months but I really think they need to treat us all with a little respect and give us time to organise ourselves so that we can continue with our jobs, and our children with their lives,"" she said. Eurotunnel said its Channel Tunnel trains were fully booked until Saturday. Earlier, customers had faced long queues to access the website. Mariana Fabricante, who is trying to return from the mountain resort of Tignes with her family, said: ""Every time I try to change the ticket, the website is busy. People would be able to make informed decisions if they had been told in advance. It's annoying and frustrating."" John Keefe, director of public affairs at Getlink, which operates the Channel Tunnel,warned people not to travel to the terminal without a confirmed booking. ""There is no space available,"" he said. Eurostar passengers arriving at St Pancras, having beaten the quarantine deadline Prices of some flights to the UK from Paris were more than Â£450, compared to Â£66 on Saturday. Many direct flights from the south of France are sold out. The cheapest Eurostar tickets were Â£210, compared with Â£165 on Saturday. But DFDS Ferries said it had added an extra four departures from Calais to help Britons return in time. It said bookings must be made before arriving at port. Some holidaymakers said they would accept the quarantine restrictions on their return instead. Jonathan Fieldsend from Woodbridge in Suffolk, who is not due to return from France with his family until 18 August, said: ""We came fully accepting the risk we were taking of quarantine being introduced. We are not going to be rushing back."" Airlines UK described the quarantine restrictions as ""another devastating blow to the travel industry already reeling from the worst crisis in its history"". The UK's ambassador to France, Lord Llewellyn,acknowledged that the new quarantine rule would be ""unwelcome news"" for Britons in the country,external, but stressed that people could continue with their holidays as long as they follow safety precautions and self-isolate on their return. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said while the Labour party supports ""evidence based measures"" at the border, it was ""vital"" that No 10 had a ""joined-up strategy"" and ""urgently"" puts in place a specific deal to support the heavily impacted travel sector. The MP added: ""That the government has still not put in place an effective track, trace and isolate system has made matters far worse and made it more likely that we are reliant on the blunt tool of 14-day quarantine."" He called on Downing Street to publish science behind its decisions, ""and details of any work being done to reduce the time needed to isolate through increased testing and other measures"".

The Foreign Office is now warning against ""all but essential travel"" to France - the quarantine measure was imposed for Spain on 25 July. A list of more than 50 so-called travel corridors - allowing movement between the UK and the other countries without the need to self-isolate on return - waspublished at the start of last monthand later expanded. But the ending of some of the exemptions on the list follows a ""significant change"" in the risk of contracting Covid-19, the Department for Transport said. It added that there had been a 66% increaseâ¯in newly reported cases per 100,000 people in France since last Friday. For the Netherlands, it was up 52%. And the increase for Malta was 105%, while it was 273% for Turks and Caicos and 1,106% for Aruba. Ahead of a government meeting on the new measures, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised to be ""absolutely ruthless"" in deciding on rules for holidaymakers from abroad. ""We can't be remotely complacent about our own situation. Everybody understands that in a pandemic you don't allow our population to be re-infected or the disease to come back in,"" he added.

Paddleboarders rescued after 15 hours in the seaSara Feeney and her cousin Ellen Glynn were found clinging to a lobster pot by a fisherman.Europe,"Volunteers helped search for the pair after they went missing off the County Galway coast A woman and a teenage girl have been found clinging to a lobster pot off the Irish coast after going missing for almost 15 hours while paddleboarding. The pair, aged 17 and 23, were found alive by a fisherman, about 17 miles (27km) from where they first set out, the RNLI said. Sara Feeney and her cousin Ellen Glynn are well and being treated at University Hospital Galway. Sara's mother Helen Feeney told RTÃ they were ""overwhelmed and grateful"". She also said paddleboards would ""never darken the doors of our houses again"" . The cousins went missing after setting out from a beach at Furbo, County Galway, on Wednesday evening. Ms Feeney said she was walking the dog on the beach when the pair went out on the paddleboards. She said everybody was in good spirits on what was a ""fabulous evening"". However when the pair did not return, she alerted the coastguard. A major search operation began after the alarm was raised at 22:00 local time. An air and sea search rescue began overnight and continued until their discovery. The Irish coastguard and local volunteers were also involved. Despite bad weather overnight, the pair - who had life jackets, but no wetsuits - were found by the fisherman. The fisherman who found them told Irish broadcaster RTÃ that he was prepared to go as far as was necessary to rescue them because otherwise they would have drifted further out to sea. Patrick Oliver and his son Morgan, 18, left the docks and headed west across the bay after he heard they were missing. Mr Oliver was able to predict where they could be, by calculating the wind speed and direction. ""They travelled there about 20 miles from the beach to the side of Inis OÃ­rr [one of the Aran Islands],"" he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Fortnite removed from iPhone App Store,"Apple has removed Fortnite from its App Store, preventing players from installing one of the world's most popular games on iPhones. It came after a Fortnite update that let players buy in-game currency at a lower rate if they bought direct from maker Epic Games - bypassing Apple. Epic appeared to know the ban would come, announcing it had filed a legal complaint minutes after the removal. Apple takes a standard 30% cut of sales from its compulsory payment system. Hours later, Google also appeared to remove the app from its Google Play Store - though it remains available on Android phones through other means, such as Epic Games' own launcher. Epic promised cheaper in-game items if players bypassed Apple's payments On iOS, the App Store is the only way to legitimately load apps. But Apple said Epic had taken the ""unfortunate step of violating the App Store guidelines"". Those guidelines ban any payment system apart from Apple's own, and has been the subject of several high-profile rows between developers and Apple. Epic said any iPhone players who already have the app installed should be able to continue playing until the game's next update rolls out. After that, they will lose some features. Those on an Apple Mac computer will not be affected, since that version does not use the iOS App Store. In addition to tweeting the legal complaint it filed in a California court, Epic also announced the imminent in-game screening of a short film titled Nineteen Eighty-Fortnite - a play on George Orwell's novel Nineteen Eighty-Four. The novel is about a dystopian society that controls its citizens and tolerates no dissent - and was itself referenced by Apple in a famous television ad in the year 1984, when the young company styled itself as taking on then-dominant IBM.

Epic Games directly referenced that advertisement in its legal complaint,external, writing: ""Apple has become what it once railed against: the behemoth seeking to control markets, block competition, and stifle innovation."" The court documents allege that Apple effectively runs a monopoly in both deciding what apps can appear on iPhones and demanding its own payment system - with the relatively high 30% cut - is used. Piers Harding-Rolls, games research director at Ampere Analysis, said Epic's update breaking the rules ""was done to make Apple remove the app"". ""Removing Fortnite from the App Store helps to deliver a groundswell of support for Epic, something it is trying to achieve."" And he added that iPhones are not the biggest platform for Fortnite, but Epic will still notice its ban - the iOS version ""generates tens of millions of dollars in revenue every month on Apple platforms"", he said. Developers really, really don't like this charge. For many, a 30% cut of profits is akin to a shakedown. Last month, one app developer likened Apple to the mafia. The criticism is essentially an anti-competition one. Apple and Google run the operating systems of pretty much all of the phones in the world. That means they get to choose who can run apps on their stores, and who can't. They also get to set the charges. This is duopoly, say some developers. Apple claims 'half a trillion dollars' app economy Apple digs in over its App Store fees In Epic Games though, Apple has an unwanted foe. Fortnite is ludicrously profitable, Epic Games has the money to take Apple on. And the way this has been done - passing the savings on the consumer - is clearly tactical. Epic Games wants to take this fight out into the open. And with the EU and US Congress looking closely at Apple's business practices, this is attention the company could do without. In its court filing, Epic said it was not seeking financial compensation. ""Epic is seeking injunctive relief to allow fair competition in these two key markets that directly affect hundreds of millions of consumers and tens of thousands, if not more, of third-party app developers,"" it said. The documents also hint at a possible larger goal. This video can not be played Jaden âWolfiezâ Ashman became the youngest esports player ever to win a million dollars ""But for Apple's illegal restraints, Epic would provide a competing app store on iOS devices,"" it says. Epic Games has already attempted to disrupt the PC gaming market with the launch of its Epic Games Store, taking on the dominant player, Steam, in an attempt to lure players away with free games, which have often been popular, top-rated titles. Piers Harding-Rolls said the row is reminiscent of that challenge - Epic's store charges game developers 12% on PC games, compared to Steam's 30%. ""Apple and Google have been a long term target of Epic CEO Tim Sweeney's ire, as he believes the 30% revenue share they charge for app sales and in-game monetisation is too high,"" he said. ""However, taking on Apple is a different challenge than in the PC market as it's impossible to build a third-party storefront on iOS, or monetise apps outside of the App Store."" Google's Android system also uses Google's payment system for app store purchases, from which Google takes a cut - but Android allows developers to point users to other payment options. In a statement, Apple said the rules were applied equally to every developer, and that Epic had updated their game ""with the express intent of violating the App Store guidelines"". ""Epic has had apps on the App Store for a decade, and have benefited from the App Store ecosystem,"" it said. ""The fact that their business interests now lead them to push for a special arrangement does not change the fact that these guidelines create a level playing field for all developers and make the store safe for all users.""

Tui sees surge in holiday bookings for next year,"Travel firm Tui has seen a sharp jump in bookings for 2021 as customers make early plans for next year. The UK's largest tour operator said bookings for next summer were up by a ""very promising"" 145%. News of a bounce-back came as Tui posted a â¬1.1bn (Â£995m) loss for the three months to June as lockdown brought the travel industry to a halt. Tui's travel operations restarted in Europe, Mexico, the Caribbean and Egypt in mid-May. Some of the new holiday bookings for 2021 are either amended bookings or holiday voucher bookings made by customers whose trips were cancelled as a result of the coronavirus lockdown. In late July, Tui said it wouldshut 166 High Street stores in the UK and Ireland. Bookings plunged 81% for this summer and are 40% lower for a scaled-back winter programme. And the industry's hopes of saving the rest of this summer were dealt a blow with new restrictions travel to Spain, and growing worries that France could be put on a quarantine list. But Tui said on Thursday,externalit was now seeing ""encouraging signs of customer demand"" as travel restrictions globally start to ease. Some travellers who have skipped holidays this summer or opted for staycations have said they intend to splash out on foreign breaks this Christmas and next summer. Last month, travel firm Kuoni said bookings for December departures to Barbados were 30% up on the same point last year, while demand for the Maldives has increased by 20%. Holiday firm Tui to shut 166 High Street shops Travel bosses demand end to blanket quarantine 'We were stopped from boarding our Greece flight' Tui also said it had agreed compensation with aircraft maker Boeing over the prolonged grounding of 737 Max planes. The travel firm is to receive ""staggered"" compensation over the next two years, credits against future orders and a deferral of 61 aircraft deliveries. The exact amount of compensation has not been disclosed. Tui also said on Thursday it had raised more money to help it weather the coronavirus crisis and cope with the winter, when travel bookings typically drop. The Germany-based travel firm said it had agreed a second loan package with the German government worth â¬1.2bn, which would give it a total cash flow of â¬2.4bn. Tui's flights and package holidays have now resumed, following easing of coronavirus restrictions At the same time, Tui said it was also looking to cut costs by 30% across the firm. Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said it will be a ""difficult path to recovery"" for the travel industry. ""The travel giant has been forced to put its hand out for a bailout from the German government to help stay afloat, but it will need to address the concerns that consumers will have when travelling again, while trying to offer a unique experience amidst social distancing measures if it's going to stand any chance of recovery,"" she said. ""Costs reductions must be a focus for the board over the next few months if the business is to have any chance of survival, which will likely add to the growing number of redundancies being made by UK firms."" Tui and other firms were this week criticised by consumer group Which? for being slow to refund travellers for flights and package holidays cancelled since March. And in July, the airline regulator, the Civil Aviation Authority (CAA), said it was ""not satisfied"" that Tui, Virgin Atlantic and Ryanair were processing refunds quickly enough.

Trump says low-pressure shower heads won't wash,"Mr Trump said his hair had to be ""perfect"" The US government has proposed changing the definition of a showerhead to allow increased water flow, following complaints from President Donald Trump about his hair routine. Under a 1992 law, showerheads in the US are not allowed to produce more than 2.5 gallons (9.5l) of water per minute. The Trump administration wants this limit to apply to each nozzle, rather than the overall fixture. Consumer and conservation groups argue that it is wasteful and unnecessary. The changes were proposed by the Department of Energy on Wednesday following complaints by Mr Trump at the White House last month. ""So showerheads - you take a shower, the water doesn't come out. You want to wash your hands, the water doesn't come out. So what do you do? You just stand there longer or you take a shower longer? Because my hair - I don't know about you, but it has to be perfect. Perfect,"" he said. How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? US president gets new hairdo and the internet went wild Trump weighs plan to keep Americans out over virus Andrew deLaski, executive director of the energy conservation group Appliance Standards Awareness Project, said the proposal was ""silly"". With four or five or more nozzles, ""you could have 10, 15 gallons per minute powering out of the showerhead, literally probably washing you out of the bathroom,"" he told the Associated Press news agency. ""If the president needs help finding a good shower, we can point him to some great consumer websites that help you identify a good showerhead that provides a dense soak and a good shower,"" he added. David Friedman, vice president of advocacy at the organisation Consumer Reports, said showerheads in the US already ""achieve high levels of customer satisfaction"", while saving people money. The proposal could face court battles if it advances, Reuters news agency reports.

"Tributes paid to three killed in train derailmentBrett McCullough, Donald Dinnie and Christopher Stuchbury died when the train left the track near Stonehaven.NE Scotland, Orkney & Shetland","Family tributes have been paid to Brett McCullough, Donald Dinnie and Chris Stuchbury The families of three men killed in a train derailment in Aberdeenshire have told of their devastation at their deaths. Train driver Brett McCullough, conductor Donald Dinnie and a passenger now named as Christopher Stuchbury, 62, died in the incident near Stonehaven. A major investigation has begun into the derailment, believed to have been caused by a landslip after heavy rain. Mr Stuchbury, from Aberdeen, worked for a marine services firm in the city. In a statement his family said: ""Chris was a much adored husband, son, dad, stepdad, grandad, brother and uncle and was a treasured and loved friend to many."" What we know about the Stonehaven derailment Three dead after passenger train derails Mr Stuchbury worked for Targe Towing and volunteered at Roxburghe House hospice in Aberdeen in his spare time. Earlier, the family of Mr McCullough described how his death had left a ""huge void"" in their lives. His wife Stephanie said: ""Words cannot describe the utterly devastating effect of Brett's death on his family and friends. ""We have lost a wonderful husband, father and son in the most awful of circumstances. ""Brett was the most decent and loving human being we have ever known and his passing leaves a huge void in all our lives. ""We would like to thank the emergency services for their heroic efforts in helping everyone affected by this tragedy and for all the messages of support and condolence we have received."" Investigation work continues at the scene of the derailment The 45-year-old father-of-three was originally from Bromley in London. He worked out of the Aberdeen rail depot and lived near the scene of the derailment. The third victim was 58-year-old conductor Donald Dinnie, whose family said they were devastated by the loss of a ""loving and proud dad, son, partner, brother, uncle and friend"". ""No words could ever describe how much he will be missed by us all and there will always be a missing piece in our hearts,"" they said in a statement. ""It is so heart warming to see how many people have fond memories of Donald and I am sure they have plenty of happy and funny stories to tell. He was a kind, caring and genuine person who was never found without a smile on his face. We know he will be deeply missed by all."" Mr Dinnie had also worked as a driver and guard during his railway career. It is thought that the 06:38 Aberdeen to Glasgow Queen Street service was derailed by a landslide afterheavy rainin the area. The alarm was raised at about 09:40 on Wednesday morning. Six others who were on the train were taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. NHS Grampian said four of them had been discharged, while the other two patients were in a stable condition. A section of the train fell down a steep embankment Emergency services remained at the scene of the accident on Thursday First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the ""hearts of a nation"" were with those affected. Scottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson, UK Transport Minister Grant Shapps and Network Rail chief executive Andrew Haines all visited the site of the crash on Thursday. Mr Shapps has asked Network Rail to produce an interim report by 1 September on the ""wider issues"" that may have led to the derailment. He said he wanted to see resilience checks carried out in ""the next few days, few hours"", given the concern about flash floods in the area. This video can not be played Grant Shapps: Stonehaven derailment site is ""completely harrowing"" ""We absolutely need to make sure it doesn't happen again and that's why I've asked Network Rail to deliver that report to me so quickly,"" he said. He also said he spoke with PC Liam Mercer, the first officer on the scene, and commended him for his bravery. And he understood an off-duty conductor managed to get off a carriage and run to alert operators, while a member of the public raised the alarm having seen smoke billowing from the trees. Mr Matheson said he did not want to speculate about what had caused the incident. ""What I think we can assess, though, is that weather has had an impact,"" he said. Mr Matheson visited Aberdeenshire on Thursday morning ""We are seeing increasingly a higher level of what are localised intense weather events that are having an impact on the transport network, including the rail network. ""What we need to do as part of the investigation is identify to what extent it had an impact and also to see what lessons can be learned."" He said some parts of the country had seen a month's rainfall in just a couple of hours on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning. He added that the derailment happened as the train driver was heading north, trying to return to Aberdeen, and that one crew member got out of the derailed train to prevent any other trains coming down the track. This video can not be played Aerial footage shows the passenger train derailment in Aberdeenshire Mr Haines said he did not want to pre-empt the outcome of the investigation. But he added: ""It is clear the weather was appalling and there were floods and landslips in the area. ""Our climate is changing and it is increasingly challenging the performance and reliability of the railway, but incidents like yesterday's devastating accident are incredibly rare, and our railway remains the safest major railway in Europe. ""Yesterday was a tragedy, a truly horrific event, and my thoughts remain with everyone affected. Understanding what happened is the key to making sure it never occurs again."" Network Rail said it would carry out detailed inspections of high-risk trackside slopes with similar characteristics to the site of the Aberdeenshire crash. Dozens of sites across Britain will be assessed using in-house engineers, specialist contractors and helicopter surveys. Scotland's Lord Advocate has asked Police Scotland, British Transport Police and the Office of Rail and Road, the independent regulator, to conduct a joint investigation into the accident. It will be carried out under the direction of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, and will run in parallel to the independent safety investigation being carried out by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch.

"Nick Cave compares cancel culture to 'bad religion'The musician believes political correctness online is having an ""asphyxiating effect"" on society.","Nick Cave has said cancel culture is akin to ""bad religion run amuck"". Writing on his website, the Australian rock star suggested that political correctness has an ""asphyxiating effect on the creative soul of a society"". ""Cancel culture"" is the term for when individuals or companies face swift public backlash and boycott over statements or actions perceived by some as offensive. It ""embodies all the worst aspects that religion has to offer"", said Cave. Answering a question from a fan, in the latest of hisRed Hand Files series,externalof correspondences, the 62-year-old wrote: ""As far as I can see, cancel culture is mercy's antithesis. Political correctness has grown to become the unhappiest religion in the world. ""Its once honourable attempt to reimagine our society in a more equitable way now embodies all the worst aspects that religion has to offer (and none of the beauty) - moral certainty and self-righteousness shorn even of the capacity for redemption. It has become quite literally, bad religion run amuck. Cancel culture: What unites young people against Obama and Trump Nick Cave performing for fans at Glastonbury Festival in 2013 ""Cancel culture's refusal to engage with uncomfortable ideas has an asphyxiating effect on the creative soul of a society."" He added: ""Compassion is the primary experience - the heart event - out of which emerges the genius and generosity of the imagination."" Cave has previously used the platform to answer questions from fans on a range of topics, including  his break-up with PJ Harvey, the death of his teenage son Arthur, and how to deal with writer's block. In the latest one, entitled ""What do you think of cancel culture?"" - apparently a question from a fan in America - he went on to say that ""creativity is an act of love that can knock up against our most foundational beliefs, and in doing so brings forth fresh ways of seeing the world."" ""This is both the function and glory of art and ideas,"" he continued. ""A force that finds its meaning in the cancellation of these difficult ideas hampers the creative spirit of a society and strikes at the complex and diverse nature of its culture. ""But this is where we are. We are a culture in transition, and it may be that we are heading toward a more equal society - I don't know - but what essential values will we forfeit in the process?"" Many people, includingcomic actor Ricky Gervais,external, appear to agree with the Red Right Hand singer about cancel culture, going as far to say that it is a potential threat to free speech. Lots of others, however, do not, and view political correctness as a force for good. In response to Cave's musings, music journalistOsman Faruqi posted,externalthat he ""would love to know what the 'uncomfortable ideas' are that Nick Cave wants to grapple with but apparently can't because of cancel culture"". Another music journalist, Shaun Curran, felt Cave made ""a fundamental mistake"" in thinking cancel culture is specifically and only targeted at the art itself. ""That's the case sometimes,""tweeted Curran,external. ""But I'd say the majority of it is actually about the behaviour of the artist which he doesn't seem to grasp"". He pointed to Michaela Coel's recent comedy-drama show I May Destroy You as an example of ""challenging art"". Artist and photographer Alex Boyd applauded Cave's sentiments, however. ""I can hear the fingers of the neo-puritans striking their keyboards in rage,""he tweeted,external. ""Tonight Nick Cave shall be cancelled for cancelling cancel culture,"" he joked. JK Rowling joins warning over free speech In July, some 150 writers, academics and activists - including authors JK Rowling, Salman Rushdie and Margaret Atwood - signed an open letter denouncing the ""restriction of debate"".

Student's 'terrifying experience' during pandemic,"This video can not be played ""I don't know what the year ahead will bring,"" says A-level student Gwenllian Griffiths ""It's all been a terrifying experience,"" is one 18-year-old's assessment of the past few months. Like thousands of other A-level students across Wales, Gwenllian Griffiths received results on Thursday. But the backdrop is different to that experienced by most other year groups - her dad became very ill with Covid-19 in March and she has been helping to care for him. ""Unfortunately I didn't get in to do medicine"" she said. Gwenllian, from Bethel near Caernarfon, Gwynedd, had hoped to study medicine at Cardiff University, but did not get the grades required after achieving an A* in the Welsh Baccalaureate, an A for Welsh, B for biology and B for Chemistry - it was one of the Bs that lost her the place. ""I'm a bit gutted to be honest. But I have an unconditional offer to study medical pharmacology at Cardiff University and that's a feeder course, so I would only have to do four years in medicine afterwards."" She said the day had been a ""rollercoaster of emotions"". ""A lot of my friends were a bit confused with grades and it was a shock at the beginning, but now we're just glad it's over and are looking to future,"" she said. A-level pupils find out 'cancelled summer' results Student's grief and Ramadan in lockdown Paralympic ambitions for injured horse-riding teen Reflecting over the past few months, she said: ""Dad was so strong and healthy, so seeing him so weak and ill made me feel that nobody is safe at the moment. ""I was lucky because of my family - we all helped each other through it."" Gwenllian's dad Gareth became very ill with coronavirus during the pandemic The build-up to results day was different than she expected as her mother nursed her dad, and her brother looked after the house, cooking and cleaning. She added: ""It's affected me mentally, the way I look at life now. ""I've realised that I don't have control over everything in my life."" Life has been different this year for Gwenllian, her dad, two brothers and the rest of the family As the country eases out of lockdown, Gwenllian believes young people fall into two categories - those that are happy to go out, and those that do not want to go out at all. She said it has been a ""really difficult"" time for those who should have spent the summer turning 18, finishing school and going out with friends. Mal Martin due home after 'miracle' recovery Choir keeps 'spirit alive' rehearsing online Turning 18 is an important time for anyone - but it has been slightly different this year The last few months has given Gwenllian a new perspective and made her think differently about things. ""It's not the end of the world,"" she said. ""We've come through a pandemic, I've seen my father very ill, and we've come through it okay. ""If that's the only thing I get out of this year, then I'm perfectly happy with that. I don't think we fully realise what we've been through these last few months."" Gwenllian also believes there should be more professional support for young people to help them come to terms with what they have experienced. ""There are so many young people, like me, who don't know what's coming next,"" she added. ""If we think about leaving school, we're leaving the web that has supported us for so long. ""It's not school who should be looking after us now."" Gwenllian believes people her age are ""on our own in a way"" and not everyone has family to help.

Thunderstorms roll in after scorching temperatures,"A woman shields from rain on Oxford Street in London Thunderstorms are moving across parts of the UK, after some areas saw the longest stretch of high temperatures since the 1960s. The severe weather caused flash floods in parts of southern England on Thursday, bringing travel disruption. The Met Office has issued yellow thunderstorm warnings for the next five days in much of England and Wales, with flooding, lightning and hail expected. It comes after torrential rain and lightninglashed parts of Scotland. Part of the M25 motorway in Surrey was closed because of flash flooding, while in Kent 19 people have been evacuated from a train which became stuck after a landslide. A motorist recorded footage of some of the flooding on the M25 The motorway is closed completely between two junctions in Surrey The Met Office has warned that while some areas could stay dry, others could see as much as 40mm of rain falling in less than an hour amid severe thunderstorms. There were thundery showers across southern England on Thursday afternoon, including the counties between Devon and Kent. This video can not be played Why are we having so many thunderstorms? BBC Weather said about 12,000 lightning strikes were detected across parts of southern Britain in the hours leading up to 18:00 BST. A wooden pavilion caught fire after a suspected lightning strike in the village of Barton Stacey in Hampshire, with eyewitness Donna Stokes saying there was a ""horrendously loud bang of thunder"". ""The pavilion has been on the playing fields for somewhere in the region of 80 years,"" said Donna In Devon, homes were flooded following a collection of thunderstorms across south-west England on Thursday. Devon and Somerset Fire and Rescue Service said on Twitter it had received numerous calls relating to properties in Devon, with some residents reporting up to 18 inches of water inside their homes. The Environment Agency hasissued flood alerts for certain areas in England and Scotland, which are separate from the weather warnings issued by the Met Office. Torrential rain and thunderstorms bring flooding South west England full to capacity, say police In pictures: Storms light up skies Thursday's heavy downpours also sparked travel disruption on rail and roads in southern England. There are closures in both directions on the M25 between junctions seven and eight near Reigate in Surrey due to flooding, according to Highways England. Motorists have been urged to allow additional time for journeys, as the disruption has caused delays of one hour and about seven miles of congestion. One motorist reported ""biblical"" rain and hail on the M25 near junction seven, as he shared a video of the flooding. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Train operator Southeastern said the line between Otford and Maidstone East was expected to remain closed. Atweet by Network Rail Kent and Sussex,externalsaid teams would be working overnight to clear mud which was washed onto the railway by torrential rain in the area. Network Rail warned of continuing disruption across the entire Southern and Thameslink networks due to severe weather conditions. It said reports of a landslip in the Merstham area in Surrey had closed the railway line via Redhill between East Croydon and Gatwick. Flooding had also shut the railway between Tattenham Corner in Surrey and Coulsdon Town in Croydon. Temperatures reached highs of 29C on Thursday, marking the first time the mercury remained below 30C in seven days Forecasters have warned severe thunderstorms could continue to bring flooding and disruption into next week. Met Office meteorologist Matthew Box said there was a risk of thunderstorms ""right through to the start of next week, and maybe even beyond that"". But he added that temperatures were cooler on Thursday, following days of scorching weather in parts of the UK. A high of 29.6C (85.3F) was recorded in the village of Frittenden in Kent, Mr Box said. It comes after temperatures surpassed 34C in central London for the sixth day in a row on Wednesday - the first time that has happened since at least 1961.

The force said it saw an increase in anti-social behaviour and public order offences on Saturday and Sunday. Assistant Chief Constable Jim Colwell said the weekend's events, spurred on by the hot weather, had forced officers to attend a ""plethora of different incidents"". And in Sussex,more homeowners had water supplies cut off or restricted on Wednesday. At least 300 householders had already been without tap water since Friday.

England's coronavirus app trial gets under way,"A trial of the English coronavirus app is getting under way. It will be limited to residents in the Isle of Wight, the London Borough of Newham andNHS volunteer responders,externalto begin with. The app will be available in Apple and Google's online stores, but users will need to enter a code to activate it. The software will tell users to self-isolate for a fortnight if the app detects they have been close to someone else diagnosed with the virus. Baroness Dido Harding - who heads up the wider Test and Trace initiative - had earlier voiced concern about implementing the automated contact-tracing feature because of fears many people who had been falsely flagged might be told to go into quarantine. The app has several other functions, including: An alert system that informs users of the coronavirus risk level close to their home, with the area defined by the first part of their postcode A QR barcode scanner, so users can check in when they visit a venue and be told if others there later tested positive A symptom-checking tool, which allows users to book a free test and get the results via the app A countdown function that comes into effect if they are told to self-isolate, so users can keep track of how long to stay at home It initially works in five languages, with plans to add more soon. The app will allow people to see their local risk level and log when they have been to a venue The contact-tracing element of the software is based on Google and Apple's privacy-centric system. The developers acknowledge there are still issues with measuring the distance between handsets, meaning some people will be incorrectly logged as being at high risk. Official social distancing guidance,externalsays that two people should not be within 2m (6.6ft) of each other for 15 minutes or more. But when trying to detect this, lab tests indicate: 31% of cases are missed when the handsets were within range 45% of cases are incorrectly flagged when the two handsets were in fact further apart However, if the boundary is set at 5m, the accuracy rates radically improve. Then the handsets detect each other in more than 99% of all cases, regardless of whether iPhones or Android devices were involved. This is not useful in practice, but indicates the flaw that caused the original NHS Covid-19 app to be cancelled has been solved. That product often failed to detect cases involving two iPhones because of restrictions imposed on third-party software by Apple. The pilot is underway on the Isle of Wight and will extend to Newham next week The team behind the new app acknowledges more work needs to be done to reduce the number of false positives and false negatives that occur at 2m, but is optimistic they can achieve this. Part of the problem at present is that Apple and Google refuse to share the raw Bluetooth signal data involved. While the two show no signs of backing down, they will shortly release a new version of their tool that should improve matters. This development has also been welcomed by those involved with Switzerland's SwissCovid app. ""While the updated Google/Apple exposure notification API [application programming interface] still aggregates and shuffles data for privacy reasons, it will expose more information needed by the app to compute exposure more precisely,"" explained Prof Mathias Payer from the EPFL university in Lausanne. The pilot comes at time when clusters of people testing positivehave led to local lockdowns, and major changes are being made to the way England'smanual contact-tracing system is run. Test and Trace officials say the motivation for the app is to give ""maximum freedom at minimum risk"", but acknowledge it is not a ""silver bullet"". ""By launching an app that supports our integrated localised approach to NHS Test and Trace, anyone with a smartphone will be able to find out if they are at risk of having caught the virus, quickly and easily order a test, and access the right guidance and advice,"" said Baroness Harding. Those involved in the trial must enter a code to begin, and will then be told if they should self-isolate and for how long - based on when their symptoms started However, she is not yet ready to say when a national rollout could occur. An academic who had served as an ethical advisor to the original scrapped app was positive about the fact that the trial was not limited to the Isle of Wight this time. ""This time it's a more diverse area - and not just one full of older white people - because it was clear that before very little could be gained from analysis of the demographics"" said Prof Lillian Edwards. But she added that the government still had a ""battle to persuade people"" to install the software. ""The evidence from Italy is that people aren't installing their Immuni contact-tracing app, but they might when the number of infections rises again."" Another public health expert was even more sceptical. ""Even if they have got it working, the app is unlikely to make a difference,"" said Prof Allyson Pollock from Newcastle University. ""The issue is not just the contact tracing but the ability to get people to isolate and quarantine. And that means financial support needs to be provided by the government.""

Teenage murderer named as judge lifts restrictionsThe 17-year-old boy who murdered Lindsay Birbeck is named as Rocky Marciano Price.Lancashire,"Price previously could not be named due to reporting restrictions The 17-year-old boy convicted of murdering teaching assistant Lindsay Birbeck has been named as Rocky Marciano Price. The 47-year-old mother-of-two's body was found in a shallow grave in Accrington Cemetery two weeks after she went missing while walking in 2019. Price, who previously could not be named due to reporting restrictions,was found guilty of her murderat Preston Crown Court on Wednesday. He will be sentenced on Friday. Trial judge Mrs Justice Yip ruled the public interest in knowing Price's identity outweighed concerns over his welfare. ""This was a dreadful crime which understandably generated strong public interest,"" she said. ""The public will naturally want to know who this person was as they come to terms with something that rocked the local community."" This video can not be played Police released CCTV footage of Price as part of an appeal for information Price had admitted moving Mrs Birbeck's body in a wheelie bin, but had claimed he buried her for a stranger who had promised him money. His parents, Creddy, 47, and Martina, 39, took him to a local police station after a CCTV clip used by police in an appeal showed a young male pulling the wheelie bin on Burnley Road. His conviction came a year to the day that Mrs Birbeck went missing. The trial heard Price had no previous convictions or cautions and had lived all his life with his parents and at their home off Whinney Hill Road, near the cemetery, where several members of his family had been laid to rest. The court heard he was an exceptionally quiet teenager with learning difficulties who attended a local specialist school after he was diagnosed with autism and attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD). It can also now be reported that Price faced two trials, as an initial case was halted in March. It was stopped after an unconnected police investigation into false imprisonment found mobile phone footage of a man claiming he was involved in Mrs Birbeck's murder and the disposal of her body. Price's defence team successfully argued that the jury should be discharged on the basis he could not receive a fair trial and they needed time to explore the footage. At the time, Mrs Justice Yip said it was ""unusual and unfortunate that the evidence has emerged during the trial"", adding that if the case had continued, the matter ""would have been pursued to the Court of Appeal on grounds of possible fresh evidence"". An investigation by more than 20 police officers later concluded that the information in the footage was false, allowing a second trial to proceed.

The Crown casts its final Prince Philip,"Jonathan Pryce will play the Duke of Edinburgh in the 1990s and early 2000s After playing kings, a Pope, a cardinal - and The High Sparrow in Game of Thrones - actor Jonathan Pryce is adding a prince to his repertoire of high-ranking roles, taking over as Prince Philip in Netflix's The Crown. The Welsh actor was nominated for an Oscar earlier this year for his role in The Two Popes, also for Netflix. He will now star opposite Imelda Staunton's Queen Elizabeth II in the final two seasons of the royal drama, which is expected to cover the 1990s and early 2000s. ""The positive experience I had making The Two Popes has given me the confidence to tackle the daunting prospect of playing Prince Philip,"" said Pryce via The Crown's official Twitter page.

Pryce in a very different regal role - as King Lear in 2014 The 73-year-old made his name on stage, winning the first of his two Tony Awards in 1977 for The Comedians, and an Olivier Award in 1980 for Hamlet. He has said,externalplaying Hamlet helped him process the violent death of his own father, a grocer, who had been attacked with a hammer. He died when Pryce was about to open The Comedians on Broadway, meaning he was unable to come home for the funeral. His Hamlet is regarded asone of the greatest modern interpretations,external, and he also earned acclaim as Shakespeare's King Lear 30 years later. Pryce moved into film with roles in Brazil, Evita, Tomorrow Never Dies and Pirates of the Caribbean. His first Oscar nomination arrived this January for playing Pope Francis in The Two Popes. He has said he also based The High Sparrow on the pontiff, while his other TV roles have included Cardinal Wolsey in the BBC adaptation of Hilary Mantel's Wolf Hall. ""The Queen has the quality of tolerance in abundance,"" the Duke said in 1997 The 1990s saw no shortage of royal drama. The decade included the break-up of Prince Charles and Princess Diana, the collapse of Prince Andrew's marriage to Sarah Ferguson, the devastating fire at Windsor Castle, and the death of Diana, Princess of Wales - which plunged the Royal Family into crisis. The drama may also go as far as the deaths of Princess Margaret and the Queen Mother, seven weeks apart in 2002, and the Queen's Golden Jubilee that summer. Matt Smith (left) and Tobias Menzies previously played Prince Philip in The Crown The Duke of Edinburgh is known for his decades of dutiful service at the side of the Queen, but during the 1990s was also often in the headlines for makingforthright or indiscreet remarks, such as the time in 1995 when he asked a Scottish driving instructor: ""How do you keep the natives off the booze long enough to pass the test?"" In 1997, the Queen and Duke marked their golden wedding anniversary. Explaining the secret of a happy marriage,he said,external: ""Tolerance is the one essential ingredient. It may not be quite so important when things are going well, but it is absolutely vital when the going gets difficult. You can take it from me that the Queen has the quality of tolerance in abundance."" Imelda Staunton (left) and Lesley Manville will play the Queen and Princess Margaret respectively Pryce will follow in the footsteps of Matt Smith and Tobias Menzies, who have played the prince in previous series. Pryce and Staunton - who will take over from Olivia Colman as the monarch - have shared screen time before, in the 1994 film Deadly Advice. Lesley Manville will play Princess Margaret. Josh O'Connor and Emma Corrin are playing Charles and Diana in the forthcoming fourth season, but it's not known whether they will stay beyond that.

"Hundreds test positive for Covid at M&S supplierHealth officials are working with the sandwich makers in Northampton, where 299 tested positive.","Greencore produces sandwiches for M&S at its factory in Northampton Almost 300 people have tested positive for Covid-19 following an outbreak at a factory which makes M&S sandwiches. Greencore in Northampton started ""proactively testing"" workers due to rising numbers of cases in the town. Lucy Wightman, Director of Public Health at Northamptonshire County Council, said 299 workers had tested positive. A spokesman for the company, which employs 2,100 people, said those who tested positive were self-isolating. He added that in each case it had ""conducted contact tracing"". Mrs Wightman said 220 people had tested positive as part of Greencore's testing and another 79 ""through the national process"" and all were employees at the site. She said 1,300 employees had been tested but there might be up to 100 more cases as between 300 and 400 results are yet to come back. The first four cases were identified on 28 July, with a further nine cases on 3 August leading Public Health Northamptonshire to ask workers to get tested. Once the 79 positive results came back, Greencore began mass testing over the last three days. Greencore said production at the plant was ""continuing as usual"" and it had no concerns about its products. By Peter Sherlock, BBC England Data Unit Northampton has been on a watchlist as an area of concern since 23 July after infection rates began rising in the town. It had the 12th highest rate of coronavirus infections in England - with the equivalent of 38 positive cases for every 100,000 people. That is still significantly below the levels of infection seen in north-west England, where council leaders have introduced stricter lockdown measures.  In Oldham and Pendle, for example, the infection rate is around 100 cases for every 100,000 people. But the confirmation of almost 300 new cases at the Greencore factory takes things to a worrying new level, and will heighten fears of a local lockdown. Northampton hadalready been identified as potentially facing a local lockdown. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the town increased from 67 in the week ending 1 August up to 85 for the week ending 8 August. Jonathan Nunn leader of Northampton Borough Council said the outbreak was ""dreadful"" and ""disappointing"". He said the council ""hopes that it is still the case"" Northampton would avoid a local lockdown. Public Health Northamptonshire said things such as car sharing and workers behaviour outside work led to the outbreak at Greencore One of those to test positive was Bakers' Union's branch secretary for the factory, Nicolae Macari. He said he tested positive on 4 August, along with his mother and father - who also work at Greencore - and his wife. ""When suddenly three or four people are pulled out of a line because they have tested positive, people are terrified,"" he said. Mrs Wightman said Greencore had ""highly effective measures in place and they continue to work extremely hard to exceed the requirements needed to be Covid-19 secure within the workplace"".

Paddleboarders rescued after 15 hours in the seaA woman and a teenager are being treated in hospital after they were found clinging to a lobster pot.Europe,"Volunteers helped search for the pair after they went missing off the County Galway coast A woman and a teenage girl have been found clinging to a lobster pot off the Irish coast after going missing for almost 15 hours while paddleboarding. The pair, aged 17 and 23, were found alive by a fisherman, about 17 miles (27km) from where they first set out, the RNLI said. Sara Feeney and her cousin Ellen Glynn are well and being treated at University Hospital Galway. Sara's mother Helen Feeney told RTÃ they were ""overwhelmed and grateful"". She also said paddleboards would ""never darken the doors of our houses again"" . The cousins went missing after setting out from a beach at Furbo, County Galway, on Wednesday evening. Ms Feeney said she was walking the dog on the beach when the pair went out on the paddleboards. She said everybody was in good spirits on what was a ""fabulous evening"". However when the pair did not return, she alerted the coastguard. A major search operation began after the alarm was raised at 22:00 local time. An air and sea search rescue began overnight and continued until their discovery. The Irish coastguard and local volunteers were also involved. Despite bad weather overnight, the pair - who had life jackets, but no wetsuits - were found by the fisherman. The fisherman who found them told Irish broadcaster RTÃ that he was prepared to go as far as was necessary to rescue them because otherwise they would have drifted further out to sea. Patrick Oliver and his son Morgan, 18, left the docks and headed west across the bay after he heard they were missing. Mr Oliver was able to predict where they could be, by calculating the wind speed and direction. ""They travelled there about 20 miles from the beach to the side of Inis OÃ­rr [one of the Aran Islands],"" he said. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

He also said he was ""delighted for their parents"" and he had thought about their ""poor mother on the beach all night looking out for them"". He said the women had survived by not panicking, keeping their heads clear and by hanging on to a buoy. ""They were definitely in shock but the weather is warm so they were lucky,"" he said. He said the pair were ""waving their paddles up in the air"" when they spotted the fishermen. They gave the women oilskin jackets and hats to help them warm up after they were rescued. He said they had been ""weak and tired"" but were able to sit up and make a ""little bit of chat"". ""They were in shock but they were thankful,"" he added. ""We got them in the boat and we brought them into the island and the chopper landed there."" Ms Feeney said the situation was ""the stuff of nightmares"". She said the family was ""forever indebted"" to the Olivers for rescuing the women. She also thanked all those who took part in the search and rescue operation. The pair had been wearing buoyancy aids and she urged people who intend to go paddleboarding to wear them. On social media, the coastguard thanked everyone who assisted. Barry Heskin, from the RNLI, said tears were shed and his team was ""jumping around the station"" when news came back that the rescue had been successful.

Figures reveal long waits for routine ops in England,"Attendances at A&E in England were 30% lower last month than in July 2019 The number of patients admitted for routine treatment in hospitals in England was down 67% in June compared with the same time last year, NHS figures show. The number of people going to accident and emergency units in England in July was also down on last year, by 30%. The coronavirus pandemic has caused disruption to many areas of the health service. But patients are being urged to seek help from the NHS when they need it. NHS England said local staff were working hard to restore non-Covid services and record numbers had received help during the pandemic through NHS 111. Meanwhile, the number of people going to their GP with symptoms of cancer and being urgently referred to a specialist is rising but still nearly 20% lower than the same time last year. A total of 153,134 urgent cancer referrals were made by GPs in England in June, compared with 194,047 in the same month last year. NHS England said more than 92% of people were having their cancer symptoms investigated within two weeks and 85,000 people had started treatment for cancer since the pandemic began. But Macmillan Cancer Support said the figures were ""still worryingly low"". Head of policy Sara Bainbridge said: ""These results from June suggest an alarming backlog of undiagnosed cancer and a growing number of people who are yet to start treatment. ""This could directly impact on many of these people's chances of survival."" In June, more people than ever before - 1.85 million - were waiting longer than 18 weeks for planned hospital surgery, such as knee and hip operations. NHS England figures also show the number of people waiting more than a year for hospital treatment rose from just over 1,000 in June last year to 50,500 for the same month this year. And a total of 94,354 patients were admitted for routine treatment in June, down from 289,203 in June 2019. The Health Foundation charity said the data showed the NHS was still ""nowhere close to business as usual following the first outbreak of Covid-19"". It said there was a risk people experiencing long waits with serious conditions would see their health deteriorate, leaving the NHS to deal with more patients needing urgent care.

Covid-19 outbreak at sandwich firm,"Greencore produces sandwiches for M&S at its factory in Northampton Almost 300 people have tested positive for Covid-19 following an outbreak at a factory which makes M&S sandwiches. Greencore in Northampton started ""proactively testing"" workers due to rising numbers of cases in the town. Lucy Wightman, Director of Public Health at Northamptonshire County Council, said 299 workers had tested positive. A spokesman for the company, which employs 2,100 people, said those who tested positive were self-isolating. He added that in each case it had ""conducted contact tracing"". Mrs Wightman said 220 people had tested positive as part of Greencore's testing and another 79 ""through the national process"" and all were employees at the site. She said 1,300 employees had been tested but there might be up to 100 more cases as between 300 and 400 results are yet to come back. The first four cases were identified on 28 July, with a further nine cases on 3 August leading Public Health Northamptonshire to ask workers to get tested. Once the 79 positive results came back, Greencore began mass testing over the last three days. Greencore said production at the plant was ""continuing as usual"" and it had no concerns about its products. By Peter Sherlock, BBC England Data Unit Northampton has been on a watchlist as an area of concern since 23 July after infection rates began rising in the town. It had the 12th highest rate of coronavirus infections in England - with the equivalent of 38 positive cases for every 100,000 people. That is still significantly below the levels of infection seen in north-west England, where council leaders have introduced stricter lockdown measures.  In Oldham and Pendle, for example, the infection rate is around 100 cases for every 100,000 people. But the confirmation of almost 300 new cases at the Greencore factory takes things to a worrying new level, and will heighten fears of a local lockdown. Northampton hadalready been identified as potentially facing a local lockdown. The number of confirmed coronavirus cases in the town increased from 67 in the week ending 1 August up to 85 for the week ending 8 August. Jonathan Nunn leader of Northampton Borough Council said the outbreak was ""dreadful"" and ""disappointing"". He said the council ""hopes that it is still the case"" Northampton would avoid a local lockdown. Public Health Northamptonshire said things such as car sharing and workers behaviour outside work led to the outbreak at Greencore One of those to test positive was Bakers' Union's branch secretary for the factory, Nicolae Macari. He said he tested positive on 4 August, along with his mother and father - who also work at Greencore - and his wife. ""When suddenly three or four people are pulled out of a line because they have tested positive, people are terrified,"" he said. Mrs Wightman said Greencore had ""highly effective measures in place and they continue to work extremely hard to exceed the requirements needed to be Covid-19 secure within the workplace"". She said the outbreak was ""about how people behave outside of Greencore, not at work,"" adding if people failed to follow the rules ""a possible local lockdown will follow"".

New Zealand reports 14 new Covid-19 cases,"New Zealand has reported 14 new Covid-19 cases a day after its biggest city, Auckland, went back into lockdown. The detection of four new infected family members earlier this week shocked a country that had recorded no locally transmitted cases for more than three months. Of the new cases, 13 have been linked back to this family, while one is an overseas arrival who was in quarantine. A three-day lockdown was imposed in Auckland on Wednesday. ""We can see the seriousness of the situation we are in,"" Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said in a news conference. ""Itâs being dealt with in an urgent but calm and methodical way."" All the confirmed cases will now go into quarantine, said officials. Some of their contacts may also be quarantined. New Zealand has been internationally praised for its early response to the pandemic. This video can not be played Epidemiologist Prof Michael Baker: ""New Zealand will get rid of the virus again"" It has again moved swiftly to reimpose strict movement restrictions in Auckland and social distancing measures across the country. Before Tuesday, New Zealand went 102 days without recording a locally transmitted case of Covid-19, one of the few countries to reach such a milestone. Ms Ardern has also said she expects the outbreak to grow further before it slows down. Health workers have been racing to find the origin of this latest cluster, testing family and work contacts of the newly infected. The 13 new infections traced to four family members include: Employees of an Auckland storage facility where one of the four infected relatives worked Relatives of those colleagues A pupil at a local school An employee of a loan company linked to the family and one of the employee's relatives Testing is being stepped up Rotorua, a spa town about 230km south-east of Auckland, which the family visited last weekend. ""We are working flat out to do the contact-tracing we need to do and trace back to find out what the source of this infection is,"" national health chief Ashley Bloomfield told Newstalk ZB radio. Other countries that had lifted Covid-19 lockdowns after seeing a drop in new cases have also seen infections rise again. The mysterious resurgence of Covid-19 in Vietnam How New Zealand went 'hard and early' to beat Covid-19 Vietnam recorded 99 days without any community transmission before a wave of new infections hit the central city of Da Nang in late July. Researchers there are also searching for the source of the latest outbreak to help contain the disease. Some health experts in New Zealand, like in Vietnam, have suggested that the virus may have been circulating in the community for several weeks before the new cases were detected. There were now familiar pre-lockdown scenes in Auckland of people rushing to the supermarkets to stock up on food. Local media also reported others in the city waiting hours to be tested for the virus. The spike in new cases has raised the possibility of an extended lockdown in the city, as New Zealand is just weeks away from a scheduled election. Ms Ardern is due to announce next steps on the lockdown on Friday and a decision on the poll before Monday.

Netflix to stream Diana musical before Broadway,"Jeanna de Waal stars as Diana and Roe Hartrampf as Prince Charles Diana the musical will be streamed on Netflix next year before it makes its official Broadway debut. This is an unprecedented move for the entertainment industry which is dealing with coronavirus restrictions. Broadway theatres remain closed during the pandemic and may not reopen this year, according to experts. The musical, based on the life story of Princess Diana, is now not scheduled to open on Broadway until 25 May next year. A filmed version of the musical, featuring the original Broadway cast, will be made without an audience in New York. Netflix hasn't given a date for when this will be streamed on its site. ""Though there is no substitute for the live theatre, we are honoured to be a part of the quality entertainment that Netflix provides its subscribers worldwide,"" the producers of Diana said in a joint statement. The production, which was originally set to open this March, had been running in previews at the time of theatre shutdowns in the US. Venues signal 'red alert' for live events West End's Les Mis and Hamilton off until 2021 Vue announces phased reopening date for cinemas This is the first time a Broadway show has gone straight to the small screen before its theatrical debut. Other Broadway shows have also been streamed but only after they were performed to live audiences. The Disney+ service began streaming a filmed version of Hamilton, the runaway Broadway hit, earlier this summer. Production companies have been reluctant to release filmed versions of shows while productions are still running in theatres, let alone before they have started their run. The concern is that once audiences have seen the movie version at home, they might not want to watch the live version in a theatre. But the industry is changing its views and adapting to theatre shutdowns by looking at online alternatives. Experts say the film version can put a show on an audience's radar and gain global exposure. The film industry faces the same dilemma with many studios opting to release movies straight to streaming services rather than cinemas. Disney decided to do this for its summer blockbuster Mulan which will debut on its Disney+ TV platform bypassing US movie theatres.

Trump says low-pressure shower heads won't washThe US calls for rules to be eased after Donald Trump complained of issues washing his hair.,"Mr Trump said his hair had to be ""perfect"" The US government has proposed changing the definition of a showerhead to allow increased water flow, following complaints from President Donald Trump about his hair routine. Under a 1992 law, showerheads in the US are not allowed to produce more than 2.5 gallons (9.5l) of water per minute. The Trump administration wants this limit to apply to each nozzle, rather than the overall fixture. Consumer and conservation groups argue that it is wasteful and unnecessary. The changes were proposed by the Department of Energy on Wednesday following complaints by Mr Trump at the White House last month. ""So showerheads - you take a shower, the water doesn't come out. You want to wash your hands, the water doesn't come out. So what do you do? You just stand there longer or you take a shower longer? Because my hair - I don't know about you, but it has to be perfect. Perfect,"" he said. How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? US president gets new hairdo and the internet went wild Trump weighs plan to keep Americans out over virus Andrew deLaski, executive director of the energy conservation group Appliance Standards Awareness Project, said the proposal was ""silly"". With four or five or more nozzles, ""you could have 10, 15 gallons per minute powering out of the showerhead, literally probably washing you out of the bathroom,"" he told the Associated Press news agency. ""If the president needs help finding a good shower, we can point him to some great consumer websites that help you identify a good showerhead that provides a dense soak and a good shower,"" he added. David Friedman, vice president of advocacy at the organisation Consumer Reports, said showerheads in the US already ""achieve high levels of customer satisfaction"", while saving people money. The proposal could face court battles if it advances, Reuters news agency reports.

"Biden and Harris say Trump has left US 'in tatters'Joe Biden and running mate Kamala Harris call President Donald Trump a ""whining"" incompetent leader.US Election 2020","This video can not be played Harris: 'America is crying out for leadership' Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and running mate Kamala Harris have attacked ""whining"" President Donald Trump as an incompetent leader who has left the US ""in tatters"". The pair held their first campaign event together, a day after Mr Biden unveiled Ms Harris as his number two. President Trump hit back, saying Ms Harris had ""dropped like a rock"" in her own presidential bid. Mr Biden will face Mr Trump, a Republican, in November's election. Profile: Who is Kamala Harris? Why Kamala Harris embraces her biracial roots Wednesday's event at a school in Wilmington, Delaware, was not open to the public, with Mr Biden, 77, citing coronavirus prevention needs. Both candidates walked on stage wearing masks to address a group of masked journalists. Mr Biden noted that Ms Harris, a US senator from California, was the first woman of colour to serve as a presidential running mate for a major US party. Mr Biden said: ""The choice we make this November is going to decide the future of America for a very, very long time."" He continued: ""Donald Trump has already started his attacks, calling Kamala, quote, nasty, whining about how she is, quote, mean to his appointees. ""It's not a surprise because whining is what Donald Trump does best, better than any president in American history. This video can not be played Kamala Harris' childhood home reacts to Biden pick ""Is anybody surprised that Donald Trump has a problem with a strong woman, or strong women across the board?"" He also attacked Mr Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, climate change, the unemployment rate and ""his politics of racist rhetoric that appeals to division"". Coming to the podium next, Ms Harris said: ""I am ready to get to work."" This video can not be played A look back at Joe Biden's life and political career The 55-year-old former prosecutor told reporters: ""Everything we care about, our economy, our health, our children, the kind of country we live in, it's all on the line."" Ms Harris -  the daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica - continued: ""America is crying out for leadership, yet we have a president who cares more about himself than the people who elected him. ""He inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden. And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground."" Viewpoint: Harris pick 'symbolic and substantive' Countries pile in on Kamala Harris celebrations Much has been made of the differences between Joe Biden and Kamala Harris since he announced her as his running mate on Tuesday afternoon. Biden is more than 20 years her senior. He's a white man, son of working-class parents in Pennsylvania. She's a multiracial woman from California, daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India. In their first joint appearance on Wednesday, however, they both spoke about what they had in common. ""Her story is America's story,"" Mr Biden said. ""Different from mine in many particulars, but also not so different in the essentials."" Ms Harris echoed this, saying that the two candidates are ""cut from the same cloth"". It's the kind of message you'd imagine would come from a campaign that's calling for national healing and unity. Of course, that didn't stop either candidate from going on the attack against their general election opponents. It's the first salvo for this ticket in what is sure to be a bare-knuckle fight for the White House. How Kamala Harris could help - or hurt - Joe Biden At a White House news conference, Mr Trump disparaged Ms Harris' failed bid for the Democratic party's presidential nomination, during which she fiercely attacked Mr Biden's record on race. Mr Trump said: ""I watched her poll numbers go boom, boom, boom, down to almost nothing, and she left angry, she left mad. This video can not be played Harris and Biden clash over his race record ""She said horrible things about him, including accusations made about him by a woman, where she, I guess, believed the woman. ""Now all of a sudden she's running to be vice-president saying how wonderful he is."" Last year Mr Biden was accused by a number of women of unwelcome contact, including touching and kissing. Mr Biden acknowledged at the time that he must respect personal space. This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? A more serious allegation surfaced this year from a former aide who accused Mr Biden of sexually assaulting her in the halls of Congress in 1993. He denied the claim. Ms Harris, who had dropped out of the presidential race at that point, said Tara Reade ""has a right to tell her story"". Whatâs behind the Biden sexual harassment allegation The sexual allegations against Donald Trump California state records,externalalso show Mr Trump donated to Ms Harris when she was a candidate for the state's attorney general in 2011 and 2013, while he was still a private citizen. Shortly before the Biden-Harris event, Mr Trump goaded Mr Biden for remaining at home for much of the campaign so far amid the pandemic lockdown. During a White House meeting with teachers who said that children learnt better in class than remotely, the president asked a asked: ""So if you're a presidential candidate and you're sitting in a basement and you're looking at a computer, that's not a good thing?"" He also tweeted an attack on the Biden-Harris ticket, saying they would put Senator Cory Booker, who is black, in charge of low-income housing. Critics said the tweet was racist. Mr Biden will formally accept the Democratic presidential nomination at next week's convention, which will largely be a virtual event because of the pandemic. He became the party's presumptive nominee in April after Bernie Sanders, his only remaining competitor, ended his own campaign. Meanwhile Mr Trump will be nominated for a second four-year term in the White House by his fellow Republicans at their party convention a week later. A 10-week campaign will follow before voters deliver their verdict in the general election on 3 November. Mr Trump and Mr Biden will hold three debates in September and October.

Netflix to stream Diana musical before BroadwayThe life story of the princess will become the first Broadway show to premiere on the small screen.Business,"Jeanna de Waal stars as Diana and Roe Hartrampf as Prince Charles Diana the musical will be streamed on Netflix next year before it makes its official Broadway debut. This is an unprecedented move for the entertainment industry which is dealing with coronavirus restrictions. Broadway theatres remain closed during the pandemic and may not reopen this year, according to experts. The musical, based on the life story of Princess Diana, is now not scheduled to open on Broadway until 25 May next year. A filmed version of the musical, featuring the original Broadway cast, will be made without an audience in New York. Netflix hasn't given a date for when this will be streamed on its site. ""Though there is no substitute for the live theatre, we are honoured to be a part of the quality entertainment that Netflix provides its subscribers worldwide,"" the producers of Diana said in a joint statement. The production, which was originally set to open this March, had been running in previews at the time of theatre shutdowns in the US. Venues signal 'red alert' for live events West End's Les Mis and Hamilton off until 2021 Vue announces phased reopening date for cinemas This is the first time a Broadway show has gone straight to the small screen before its theatrical debut. Other Broadway shows have also been streamed but only after they were performed to live audiences. The Disney+ service began streaming a filmed version of Hamilton, the runaway Broadway hit, earlier this summer. Production companies have been reluctant to release filmed versions of shows while productions are still running in theatres, let alone before they have started their run. The concern is that once audiences have seen the movie version at home, they might not want to watch the live version in a theatre. But the industry is changing its views and adapting to theatre shutdowns by looking at online alternatives. Experts say the film version can put a show on an audience's radar and gain global exposure. The film industry faces the same dilemma with many studios opting to release movies straight to streaming services rather than cinemas. Disney decided to do this for its summer blockbuster Mulan which will debut on its Disney+ TV platform bypassing US movie theatres.

Will the exam 'triple lock' affect me? And other questions,"A-level and GCSE students in England will be given grades estimated by their teachers, rather than by an algorithm, after a government U-turn. Experts Eddie Playfair and Catherine Sezen, senior policy managers at theAssociation of Colleges,,externalare answering your questions. Williamson 'incredibly sorry' for exam distress U-turn on A-levels and GCSEs as teacher grades used How have exam results been decided this year? Catherine Sezen and Eddie Playfair offer personalised advice on what to do next Now that we know that the grades predicted by teachers - also known as centre assessment grades, or CAGs for short - will stand, this means that there will be a five-point increase in A* grades and a 10-point increase in A grades or above. University courses may well be able to manage the increased demand for high tariff courses, particularly if there is a relaxation of the cap on growth - called the student number controls. Health Secretary Matthew Hancock has saidthe government is also considering lifting the cap on medical places. I'm so sorry you missed your firm offer. First of all it may be worth revisiting this with Durham in case the position has changed. Universities are working hard to honour the offers they've made, whether UK or international, and Covid-19 has disrupted education for students across the world. UK and international applicants are not really competing for the same places though, as the admissions and funding systems are different. For example, the removal of Student Number Controls means that many universities could now offer more places to their UK students, and this does not apply to international students. I'm afraid the triple lock system has been overtaken by events and your son's D will stand, since it is higher than the CAG. There may be some grounds for an appeal and it's worth discussing this with his college or school. There's no reason to expect that this year's higher-than-usual grades will impact the opportunities for next year's students. Universities will be aware of the different grade profiles in different years and are likely to adjust their offers and decision-making accordingly. If your daughter's offer has been confirmed this shouldn't be withdrawn. Students may have some opportunity to change their minds but confirmed offers should stand. The government's announcement thatit is considering lifting the cap on the number of medical student placesmay also help. As far we are aware, students awaiting their GCSE grades on Thursday will receive their CAG from their school or college - and students who received their A or AS-level results last Thursday will be reissued their CAG. If students' calculated grades were higher than the CAG, their calculated grade will stand. If you received results last Thursday, the best thing to do is to contact your school or college. If you are expecting results this week, your school or college should confirm the process. Schools and colleges have very thorough quality assurance systems in place to ensure that results are not biased. The grades given by teachers are moderated at department and centre level to ensure that they are as fair as possible. Pupils protesting outside Education Secretary Gavin Williamson's constituency office BTecs are structured very differently to A-levels, and so the approach to awarding them is also different. BTecs were not subject to the same statistical moderation process as A-levels. They comprise modular units that students complete and are assessed at regular stages during their course of study, so prior to March 2020, students had already ""banked"" graded units for their qualification. These formed part of the evidence used to award grades for the externally assessed units and the final overall qualification grade. If you have individual concerns about BTec or other technical and vocational qualifications, the best thing to do is to contact your school or college. Universities are used to dealing with fluctuations in numbers between years but at this stage it's impossible to tell whether the number of university places in 2021 will be affected at all. Students taking exams next summer will certainly have been impacted by the disruption this year - and of course further disruption can't be ruled out. There have been some adaptations made to assessment and content for 2021 but the assumption is that public exams will go ahead next summer - the public health situation permitting. If exams take place next year, the grading system should be more like a normal year, but there will be a case for some ""leniency"" to allow for disruption. You are absolutely right - this summer's Centre Assessed Grades are separate from the predicted grades used for UCAS or other purposes and they may not be the same. The process for producing CAGs was careful and rigorous, and was subjected to internal moderation. It is these CAGs and rankings which were submitted to awarding organisations as part of this summer's process. The ""calculated"" grades which were issued last week had been statistically adjusted resulting in 39% of them being downgraded. These have now mostly been superseded by the original CAGs where they are higher. It's been a bit of a rollercoaster - but no one will have lower A-level grades than they got last week and many will have higher grades. If your son has accepted this place and is happy with it he doesn't need to do anything more except perhaps confirm that decision with the university concerned. We can't give a legal opinion on that, but universities are doing their best to honour all the offers they made - including where a student's grade has now changed. They will need a few days to sort this out but they will have been helped by the lifting of student number controls which would have limited how many places they could fill. As far as we know, the autumn series is still going ahead so students will have the opportunity to take exams this autumn as well as next summer - so the ""resit"" option is still available where it makes sense. These are questions which should be raised directly with the IB Organisation. We know that Ofqual has asked it to scrutinise the grades awarded this summer to ensure they have been delivered in line with Ofqual's new process. I'm sure that receiving universities will want to be as flexible and helpful in responding to candidates with IB Diplomas as they were with A-level candidates. We gather that there have been some delays with some BTec awards and we know that Pearson - the company which runs BTecs - is working to resolve this. We think that only 0.5% of BTec centre assessed grades were adjusted downwards and it's not clear whether they will now be moved up. Will BTec students have their grades changed? Ofqual has just published an update on vocational and technical qualifications. Although calculated results have been issued for many vocational and technical qualifications, in only a very few cases has the same kind of statistical standardisation process of CAGs been used and so Monday's announcement shouldn't impact on the majority of vocational qualifications. You can findmore information on the Ofqual website.,externalIf you still have any questions about your result I would suggest that you speak to your school or college. It's possible that more students with Scottish Highers might have a small impact on places available in English universities, but the difference in scale between the two countries probably means this will not be significant overall. I am sure universities will want to honour the offers they've made. This was the year of the results without any exams being taken It's been clear from the start that unfortunately some private candidates would not be able to receive CAGs, and this is obviously far from ideal. It may be possible for them to progress on to the course they want if they can be assessed by the institution they wish to join. There is also the option of taking exams in the autumn which will result in grades which can be used for progression. You will need to discuss this with both your firm and insurance universities as soon as possible, now that you know that your CAG will be your final grade. Now that your son knows what his final grade is, he should discuss this with both his first choice university and also with the university he applied to through clearing. Calculated grades were higher than CAGs for 2.3% of all entries, and these will be honoured. Yes, it is possible to accept an offer and take the exam. Your school or college will be able to advise you on the best option. If your son or daughter is 18 then the college cannot share information with you unless your child agrees, as they are now classified as an adult. They should be able to tell you how results will be sent out, or whether your son or daughter can collect them from the college. The college will be able to provide information, advice and guidance to your son or daughter to help them think about next steps. This might help as the basis of a chat with your child. The best thing to do is to ask the university how long they will keep the place open while you weigh up the options. Universities are being very flexible this year. The alternative offer from your firm choice, including a foundation year, is of course an extra year. If you really want to go to that university it is a good option, but the other university course may also be right for you. Give the university a call and then you will know how long you have got to consider both. Your daughter might get results if the school or college that was going to enter her had sufficient evidence (course work for example) to give her a centre assessed grade. If not there will be an opportunity for your daughter to take an exam in the autumn. The school or college will have more details about that. You need to discuss this with the college or school you attended in 2019-20 to consider the various options open to you. Simply repeating a year is not generally recommended unless there are exceptional circumstances - but of course 2020 has been pretty exceptional! If you have the possibility of progressing to a higher level - for example university - that might be the best option, but don't make any final decisions without getting support and advice from your college or school first. When producing CAGs, centres will have predicted how a student would have performed assuming they had received all the additional support and access arrangements which they require because of a disability. Hopefully, any mock processes would also have included that additional support and this is definitely worth discussing with your centre. The system this year was designed to make sure that the class of 2020 was not disadvantaged, and to produce outcomes which are broadly similar to previous years. So we expect the national grade profile to reflect this. This should provide reassurance for employers, universities and colleges that this year's grades have an equivalent value to those of previous years. How can I find a new job? The autumn exams are an opportunity for students entered this summer to take an exam. The grade they are awarded will have equal value and so this can inform any applications they are making to university in 2021. The current plan is for exams next summer to go ahead as normal, with a few alterations, and they should be seen as equivalent to any other year. In the future this is certainly worth exploring, but given the timeframe this year it would have been very difficult to ensure that all students would have been adequately prepared to undertake exams online. Not all students will have had appropriate equipment or spaces to undertake exams. Do you have a question about your exam results? Use the form to send it to us.

"Investigation into fatal train derailment beginsThe train driver, a conductor and a passenger were killed in the crash in Aberdeenshire on Wednesday.","Family tributes have been paid to Brett McCullough, Donald Dinnie and Chris Stuchbury The families of three men killed in a train derailment in Aberdeenshire have told of their devastation at their deaths. Train driver Brett McCullough, conductor Donald Dinnie and a passenger now named as Christopher Stuchbury, 62, died in the incident near Stonehaven. A major investigation has begun into the derailment, believed to have been caused by a landslip after heavy rain. Mr Stuchbury, from Aberdeen, worked for a marine services firm in the city. In a statement his family said: ""Chris was a much adored husband, son, dad, stepdad, grandad, brother and uncle and was a treasured and loved friend to many."" What we know about the Stonehaven derailment Three dead after passenger train derails Mr Stuchbury worked for Targe Towing and volunteered at Roxburghe House hospice in Aberdeen in his spare time. Earlier, the family of Mr McCullough described how his death had left a ""huge void"" in their lives. His wife Stephanie said: ""Words cannot describe the utterly devastating effect of Brett's death on his family and friends. ""We have lost a wonderful husband, father and son in the most awful of circumstances. ""Brett was the most decent and loving human being we have ever known and his passing leaves a huge void in all our lives. ""We would like to thank the emergency services for their heroic efforts in helping everyone affected by this tragedy and for all the messages of support and condolence we have received."" Investigation work continues at the scene of the derailment The 45-year-old father-of-three was originally from Bromley in London. He worked out of the Aberdeen rail depot and lived near the scene of the derailment. The third victim was 58-year-old conductor Donald Dinnie, whose family said they were devastated by the loss of a ""loving and proud dad, son, partner, brother, uncle and friend"". ""No words could ever describe how much he will be missed by us all and there will always be a missing piece in our hearts,"" they said in a statement. ""It is so heart warming to see how many people have fond memories of Donald and I am sure they have plenty of happy and funny stories to tell. He was a kind, caring and genuine person who was never found without a smile on his face. We know he will be deeply missed by all."" Mr Dinnie had also worked as a driver and guard during his railway career. It is thought that the 06:38 Aberdeen to Glasgow Queen Street service was derailed by a landslide afterheavy rainin the area. The alarm was raised at about 09:40 on Wednesday morning. Six others who were on the train were taken to Aberdeen Royal Infirmary. NHS Grampian said four of them had been discharged, while the other two patients were in a stable condition. A section of the train fell down a steep embankment Emergency services remained at the scene of the accident on Thursday First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the ""hearts of a nation"" were with those affected. Scottish Transport Secretary Michael Matheson, UK Transport Minister Grant Shapps and Network Rail chief executive Andrew Haines all visited the site of the crash on Thursday. Mr Shapps has asked Network Rail to produce an interim report by 1 September on the ""wider issues"" that may have led to the derailment. He said he wanted to see resilience checks carried out in ""the next few days, few hours"", given the concern about flash floods in the area. This video can not be played Grant Shapps: Stonehaven derailment site is ""completely harrowing"" ""We absolutely need to make sure it doesn't happen again and that's why I've asked Network Rail to deliver that report to me so quickly,"" he said. He also said he spoke with PC Liam Mercer, the first officer on the scene, and commended him for his bravery. And he understood an off-duty conductor managed to get off a carriage and run to alert operators, while a member of the public raised the alarm having seen smoke billowing from the trees. Mr Matheson said he did not want to speculate about what had caused the incident. ""What I think we can assess, though, is that weather has had an impact,"" he said. Mr Matheson visited Aberdeenshire on Thursday morning ""We are seeing increasingly a higher level of what are localised intense weather events that are having an impact on the transport network, including the rail network. ""What we need to do as part of the investigation is identify to what extent it had an impact and also to see what lessons can be learned."" He said some parts of the country had seen a month's rainfall in just a couple of hours on Tuesday night and Wednesday morning. He added that the derailment happened as the train driver was heading north, trying to return to Aberdeen, and that one crew member got out of the derailed train to prevent any other trains coming down the track. This video can not be played Aerial footage shows the passenger train derailment in Aberdeenshire Mr Haines said he did not want to pre-empt the outcome of the investigation. But he added: ""It is clear the weather was appalling and there were floods and landslips in the area. ""Our climate is changing and it is increasingly challenging the performance and reliability of the railway, but incidents like yesterday's devastating accident are incredibly rare, and our railway remains the safest major railway in Europe. ""Yesterday was a tragedy, a truly horrific event, and my thoughts remain with everyone affected. Understanding what happened is the key to making sure it never occurs again."" Network Rail said it would carry out detailed inspections of high-risk trackside slopes with similar characteristics to the site of the Aberdeenshire crash. Dozens of sites across Britain will be assessed using in-house engineers, specialist contractors and helicopter surveys. Scotland's Lord Advocate has asked Police Scotland, British Transport Police and the Office of Rail and Road, the independent regulator, to conduct a joint investigation into the accident. It will be carried out under the direction of the Crown Office and Procurator Fiscal Service, and will run in parallel to the independent safety investigation being carried out by the Rail Accident Investigation Branch.

"Biden and Harris say Trump has left US 'in tatters'Joe Biden and running mate Kamala Harris call President Donald Trump a ""whining"" incompetent leader.","This video can not be played Harris: 'America is crying out for leadership' Democratic presidential candidate Joe Biden and running mate Kamala Harris have attacked ""whining"" President Donald Trump as an incompetent leader who has left the US ""in tatters"". The pair held their first campaign event together, a day after Mr Biden unveiled Ms Harris as his number two. President Trump hit back, saying Ms Harris had ""dropped like a rock"" in her own presidential bid. Mr Biden will face Mr Trump, a Republican, in November's election. Profile: Who is Kamala Harris? Why Kamala Harris embraces her biracial roots Wednesday's event at a school in Wilmington, Delaware, was not open to the public, with Mr Biden, 77, citing coronavirus prevention needs. Both candidates walked on stage wearing masks to address a group of masked journalists. Mr Biden noted that Ms Harris, a US senator from California, was the first woman of colour to serve as a presidential running mate for a major US party. Mr Biden said: ""The choice we make this November is going to decide the future of America for a very, very long time."" He continued: ""Donald Trump has already started his attacks, calling Kamala, quote, nasty, whining about how she is, quote, mean to his appointees. ""It's not a surprise because whining is what Donald Trump does best, better than any president in American history. This video can not be played Kamala Harris' childhood home reacts to Biden pick ""Is anybody surprised that Donald Trump has a problem with a strong woman, or strong women across the board?"" He also attacked Mr Trump's handling of the coronavirus pandemic, climate change, the unemployment rate and ""his politics of racist rhetoric that appeals to division"". Coming to the podium next, Ms Harris said: ""I am ready to get to work."" This video can not be played A look back at Joe Biden's life and political career The 55-year-old former prosecutor told reporters: ""Everything we care about, our economy, our health, our children, the kind of country we live in, it's all on the line."" Ms Harris -  the daughter of immigrants from India and Jamaica - continued: ""America is crying out for leadership, yet we have a president who cares more about himself than the people who elected him. ""He inherited the longest economic expansion in history from Barack Obama and Joe Biden. And then, like everything else he inherited, he ran it straight into the ground."" Viewpoint: Harris pick 'symbolic and substantive' Countries pile in on Kamala Harris celebrations Much has been made of the differences between Joe Biden and Kamala Harris since he announced her as his running mate on Tuesday afternoon. Biden is more than 20 years her senior. He's a white man, son of working-class parents in Pennsylvania. She's a multiracial woman from California, daughter of immigrants from Jamaica and India. In their first joint appearance on Wednesday, however, they both spoke about what they had in common. ""Her story is America's story,"" Mr Biden said. ""Different from mine in many particulars, but also not so different in the essentials."" Ms Harris echoed this, saying that the two candidates are ""cut from the same cloth"". It's the kind of message you'd imagine would come from a campaign that's calling for national healing and unity. Of course, that didn't stop either candidate from going on the attack against their general election opponents. It's the first salvo for this ticket in what is sure to be a bare-knuckle fight for the White House. How Kamala Harris could help - or hurt - Joe Biden At a White House news conference, Mr Trump disparaged Ms Harris' failed bid for the Democratic party's presidential nomination, during which she fiercely attacked Mr Biden's record on race. Mr Trump said: ""I watched her poll numbers go boom, boom, boom, down to almost nothing, and she left angry, she left mad. This video can not be played Harris and Biden clash over his race record ""She said horrible things about him, including accusations made about him by a woman, where she, I guess, believed the woman. ""Now all of a sudden she's running to be vice-president saying how wonderful he is."" Last year Mr Biden was accused by a number of women of unwelcome contact, including touching and kissing. Mr Biden acknowledged at the time that he must respect personal space. This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? A more serious allegation surfaced this year from a former aide who accused Mr Biden of sexually assaulting her in the halls of Congress in 1993. He denied the claim. Ms Harris, who had dropped out of the presidential race at that point, said Tara Reade ""has a right to tell her story"". Whatâs behind the Biden sexual harassment allegation The sexual allegations against Donald Trump California state records,externalalso show Mr Trump donated to Ms Harris when she was a candidate for the state's attorney general in 2011 and 2013, while he was still a private citizen. Shortly before the Biden-Harris event, Mr Trump goaded Mr Biden for remaining at home for much of the campaign so far amid the pandemic lockdown. During a White House meeting with teachers who said that children learnt better in class than remotely, the president asked a asked: ""So if you're a presidential candidate and you're sitting in a basement and you're looking at a computer, that's not a good thing?"" He also tweeted an attack on the Biden-Harris ticket, saying they would put Senator Cory Booker, who is black, in charge of low-income housing. Critics said the tweet was racist. Mr Biden will formally accept the Democratic presidential nomination at next week's convention, which will largely be a virtual event because of the pandemic. He became the party's presumptive nominee in April after Bernie Sanders, his only remaining competitor, ended his own campaign. Meanwhile Mr Trump will be nominated for a second four-year term in the White House by his fellow Republicans at their party convention a week later. A 10-week campaign will follow before voters deliver their verdict in the general election on 3 November. Mr Trump and Mr Biden will hold three debates in September and October. Ms Harris will debate Vice-President Mike Pence in October. The unstoppable rise of Kamala Harris Who is Kamala Harris? Video, 00:03:48Who is Kamala Harris? Trump calls Harris 'meanest' US senator.

LiveLiveCoronavirus-hit A-level results to be published6 minutes ago6 minutes ago Thousands waiting for A-level resultsThousands waiting for A-level resultsLive Coronavirus-hit A-level results to be published  6 minutes ago,"Official results show 29.9% of students in Wales achieved A* and As, up from 27% last year Overall, 98.6% of students achieved A* - E, compared with 97.6% in 2019 Schools across north Wales say they have ""no understanding or confidence in the standardisation process"" Exams were cancelled due to coronavirus, with grades being calculated using teachers' estimates and a formula to standardise results Welsh pupils are promised their grades will not be lower than their AS results Rachel Flint, Ben Frampton and Catherine Evans That's all from us on today's live page - we'll be back tomorrow to update you on the coronavirus outbreak developments. Here are your latest stories in Wales:  If you're one of the students picking up your A-level results today, we wish you all the best for your future. An AS-level student says she is ""distraught"" after her predicted three B grades turned into two Ds and a U. Abbie Cooper, 17, from Cwmbran, received D grades in politics and psychology and a U in biology and is now worried about what the results will mean for her university prospects. ""Last year I couldn't attend college a lot due to anxiety and mental health issues but any time I did a mock or a piece of work I'd still get a D, a C or a B. The Ds that I did get had been improved to a B and a C at the end of the year, and my predicted at the end of the year was a B, B, B,"" she said. Abbie, who attends Coleg Gwent, added: ""It kind of feels like they just got a number generator or a letter generator and gave you a grade based on that. ""It sucks because I need these to apply for university next year because these are my predicted for university. How can I go anywhere with these?"" She hopes to appeal against her grades. Up to 4,500 students may have benefited from last-minute changes to today's A-level results. On Wednesday afternoon, education minister Kirsty Williams pledgedgrades would be no lower than pupils' earlier AS results. Qualifications Wales said last week that teacher estimates had been ""generous"", resulting in thousands of grades being adjusted down. This affected more than four in 10 of all grades - more than 12,500. But after the minister intervened, students whose results today are worse than their earlier AS grades in that subject -it is believed this could involve between 3,000 and 4,500- will now see their A-levels readjusted ""as soon as possible"". Pupils have faced an ""enormous amount
of uncertainty and anxiety"" over the arrangements for receiving their A-level
grades and their options if they are unhappy with their results, says NASUWT's general secretary. Dr Patrick Roach said while it had been widely accepted that coronavirus would create very challenging conditions, the last-minute changes to the arrangements have ""heightened the stress and anxiety for many young people"". âNo young personâs future life chances
should be compromised as a direct consequence of the decision this year to
cancel examinations due to the coronavirus pandemic,"" he said. âAt the centre of this latest political
storm are those young people whose futures depend on their awards and the
consequences of ministerial decisions."" He encouraged employers, higher education institutions and training providers to be flexible when making recruitment and admissions decisions this year. A growing number of schools are expressing concern that grades received today are not a fair or accurate reflection of the standards pupils can achieve. Neil Foden, a member of the national executive of the National Education Union, said that from his contact with schools, more than 90% of headteachers were unhappy. âThere is real concern in schools about the number of learners whose results have been downgraded from the teacher estimates,"" said Mr Foden. âThis is already the generation whose wellbeing and, in some cases, mental health, has been affected by lockdown and concerns about Covid-19 and a number feel that in some way their results would not be as valid because they hadnât sat a formal exam. ""Now they are the generation who could be short-changed by a statistical model that is clearly not fit for purpose. âLearners in schools where there is long term statistical evidence of high levels of progress between AS and A-level have seen their results downgraded, in some cases by three grades.â The appeal process in Wales could take eight weeks, added Mr Foden, who said students are expected to go ""cap in hand"" to universities to ask them to be flexible while appeals are resolved. A student who left school to look after her terminally-ill grandmother has achieved top grades in her A-levels. Tazkia Choudhury, 20, got an A* and two As in biology, chemistry and history, three years after leaving the classroom to become a full-time carer. The teenager, from Pontypridd, who has dreamt of becoming a doctor since she was a child, went back to college in memory of her grandmother. She now hopes to train to study medicine at Sheffield University and become a cancer specialist. ""I was nervous about doing the same subjects, but my tutors encouraged me and reassured me that I would get support throughout. I was aiming to get Cs so couldn't believe when I got As,"" said the Coleg y Cymoedd student. ""It gave me the confidence to think, 'actually, you know what? I can apply for medicine'."" Tazkia Choudhury said she had always dreamt of becoming a doctor Welsh students have ""had the worst of it"", says one student, who got lower than predicted grades. This video can not be played A-levels: Lower grades than estimated 'not the best' Grading was always going to be ""fraught with difficulty"", says Wales' National Education Union. NEU Cymru secretary David Evans said Wales needed a system where learners were not disadvantaged by having their exams unfairly downgraded. ""We therefore supported a system which placed trust in the profession to assess pupil performance. But that was just one part of the process and although there have been quality assurance checks, it was inevitable that anomalies would arise,"" he said. He added the NEU trusts the appeals processes will be ""robust"" in correcting such anomalies so young people's futures are protected. âExam grades are a ticket to their futures and should not reflect where you live, but what you are capable of. ""It has been an unprecedented year for these young people, and grades must reflect their true ability for there to be confidence in the system.""  Education union UCAC has warned ""results will not be clear until the start of next week"". General secretary Dilwyn Roberts-Young said: ""It is important that we recognise the hard work and success of candidates and teachers today, despite the very challenging situation we face. ""We also recognise that these are likely to be the most appropriate procedures due to the challenges facing WJEC and Qualifications Wales. âHowever, there remains serious concern that there are many discrepancies at individual and centre level, in spite of the education ministerâs pledge last night."" He said the last-minute changes and the results of individuals are ""inevitably going to create anxiety"" and added the union hopes this will not be repeated next week when GCSE results are announced. Schools across north Wales say they have ""no understanding or confidence in the standardisation process"", which has led to ""significant inconsistencies"". The six north Wales councils said they were concerned over a ""lack of transparency"" and said parents and schools have been ""disappointed and possibly let down"". ""We would like to seek reassurance from Welsh government that pupils in north Wales will not be disadvantaged and miss opportunities to attend the university, further education or employment pathway of their choice when compared to their peers in other countries in the UK, especially Scotland,"" they said in a statement. ""It seems that in Wales there is a grave danger that protecting the examination brand is more important than recognising the needs of learners, especially the most vulnerable in these unprecedented circumstances that we are managing. ""The standardisation process, details of which have not been shared with the profession, has had a detrimental effect on the morale of teachers and leaders in schools by significantly undermining their professional judgement and that parental confidence will have also been undermined by such discrepancies in results that we see today."" The Welsh Conservative's education spokeswoman Suzy Davies MS has congratulated pupils on their A-level results, encouraging them to ""seek out routes to excellence"". ""I hope your results support your chosen path, be that to university, apprenticeships or the world of work,"" she said. But, she added ""no stone can be left unturned"" by the Welsh government in allowing pupils to secure top grades. âNot all of our pupils who have obtained their A-levels today will go to university, so it is crucial that more opportunities are available, including more degree apprenticeships. âBut, once again, I would like to wish pupils all the best for the future. Seek out those other routes to excellence. The world can still be your oyster.â Disappointed students are already planning to appeal over lower-than-expected grades. Zac Evans, from Ysgol Glan Clwyd in St Asaph, said he was ""not feeling too badly"" about his C grade in design technology, but did not think it was a fair reflection of his work. ""I'm going to
look into an appeal with the hope of getting a higher grade in DT, especially because I was hoping for a B,"" he said. He added that, following advice from his head teacher, he believed ""it will all be OK in the long run"". ""They'll be realising how the
application process works on Monday, because they say it's changing, and come Monday, I'll be looking into it,"" he added. Today's results show Wales has proportionately more pupils with top grades and grades A* to C than in England, but fewer than Northern Ireland There has also been a 3.3% rise in the proportion of A* to C grades in Wales, higher than elsewhere. Students who received grades lower than their AS results have been told ""not to worry"" by the Welsh government. A spokesperson said the WJEC will issue revised grades ""as soon as possible"" and advised students to speak to their chosen university as soon as possible to discuss their situation. As there will be fewer than expected foreign students studying in Wales and across the UK due to coronavirus, there should be ""plenty of spaces for Welsh students"", added the spokesman. More than 12,500 A-level grades were lowered by the exam watchdog after teachers' predictions were deemed ""too generous"". Qualifications Wales standardised results, ahead of them being given to students today. The lowering affects more than four in 10 of all grades - more than 12,500. Results had been based on teachers' estimates, after exams were cancelled during the coronavirus pandemic. But students whose results today are worse than their earlier AS grades in that subject will see their A-levels adjusted, after a last-minute intervention by the Welsh government. Abu Latif, Joe Cunningham and Vicky Baker look at their AS Level results at Ffynone House School, in Swansea One student who got results two grades lowered than he was predicted said the marking system had been ""unfair"". A-levels had been based on estimated grades due to the coronavirus pandemic, but thousands of marks were lowered by the exam watchdog after some teachers' marks were deemed ""too generous"". Yesterday, the Welsh government said students would not get results lower than what they achieved in their AS subjects, in a last-minute intervention. But with grades already having been given to school and colleges, students are being told to check their results and flag up issues. Merthyr College student Bradley Desmier got an E in drama, when he was predicted a C, while for photography he got a D when he was predicted a B. In England students have been told they will not get a result lower than what they got in their mock exams. ""It is quite a big drop that I received and it wasnât the best feeling to open up my piece of paper to those results,"" he said. ""Iâve been working hard to get the grades that I deserve, and for the Welsh government to give me these itâs quite unfair to be honest. ""Itâs been quite stressful, and I think Welsh students have had the worst out of it."" The increase in top grades ""disguises a great deal of volatility"" among result at school and student level, says the Association of School and College Leaders (ASCL Cymru). Director Eithne Hughes said the education body had received many calls from frustrated, confused and disappointed school leaders. âThey report that grades have been pulled down in a way that they feel to be utterly unfair and unfathomable, and they are extremely concerned about the detrimental impact on the young people concerned,"" she said. âSchool leaders worked very hard to provide accurate grades to the WJEC exam board, carefully following all the guidance, and are dismayed that the statistical model then used to standardise these grades has had such a devastating impact. ""This is in terms of both the number of grades lowered and some studentsâ results being pulled down by more than one grade."" She described the statistical process as a ""blunt instrument"" which has ""created clear injustices"". ""The education system is not a statistical model, it is a collection of individuals, and we fear the process has lacked this important degree of nuance,"" she said. ASCL Cymru is  calling on the Welsh government and the exam regulator Qualifications Wales to review the situation as a matter of urgency. For students opening their results at Ysgol Glan Clwyd in St Asaph this morning there have been a mixture of emotions. Dylan Sandland said he needed 3 As and was ""disappointed"" when he got an A, B and a C. ""I've checked UCAS and I got in so now I'm happy,"" he said. Dylan said it was difficult to get results after seven years' hard work which were not based on exam results. But for Lois Roberts, who is set to go to Cardiff Metropolitan University to do speech and language therapy, said she was happy with her results. ""I only put one choice so I'm really happy - it could have gone either way,"" she said. ""It's a massive relief, I've been thinking about it for so long now and just like that, by coming into school it's over."" Lois Roberts said she was really happy with her results Dylan Sandland said he was initially disappointed When Heavenly Bomba, from the Democratic Republic of Congo, moved to Cardiff to be reunited with her mother, she wanted to study medicine. But the 19-year-old could not speak English at the time. While the focus is on A-levels today, many who have studied outside the traditional route in the classroom, will also get results helping them towards a career in their chosen field. Heavenly is one of many students on the Future Pathways programme, supported by Cardiff City, who have got their exam results today. The programme provides an alternative style of learning for those leaving secondary school, offering BTEC courses and a foundation degree in community football and development. Heavenly enrolled on a traineeship programme with the foundation and is now a full-time student and studying for a BTEC level 3 extended diploma in sport, with the hope of going to university to study physiotherapy. âComing here has made me realise that I still have a future and that I can make the most of my education,"" she said, ""I thought I would only be here to develop my English, but I am part of a team here. I am with people who want to help me grow in my new home.â After leaving school without any qualifications, Nathan Chichester, 20, from Cardiff, started on the programme due to his love of the Bluebirds. He has been accepted on the charityâs foundation degree, a two-year course designed for people wanting to gain a university qualification, working towards a career in football. âIâve been massively inspired by the tutors at Cardiff City FC Foundation, they have helped me realise and achieve my goals, as well as provide me with an insight into my future career options,"" he said. Nathan Chichester in the classroom Identical twin sisters are setting off to Oxford University together - but will finally be torn apart as they go to different colleges. Cardiff Sixth Form College students Arianne and Enyala Banks both achieved top A-level results, but in very different subjects. Arianne studied French, history, politics and biology, while her sister Enyala took Maths, physics, chemistry and history. The 18-year-olds have chosen different paths for when they arrive at Oxford in the autumn. Arianne will study law with French law at Mansfield College - while Enyala will read materials science at Queen's College. ""We are used to answering to each other's names so it was refreshing to actually have our own space and to realise that as well as being similar we also had room to develop very different talents,"" said Arianne.

Underground heating projects get Â£16m cash boost,"The Cardiff Heat Network Project will distribute waste heat generated by the Viridor incinerator through a network of pipes Funding has been confirmed for two major projects to supply renewable heat to buildings in parts of south Wales. Heat network projects in Cardiff and Bridgend will take excess heat produced at industrial sites to public buildings in the area in the initial phase. The UK and Welsh governments will contribute a combined Â£15.2m in grants and loans towards the Cardiff project, which is led by the city council. The Bridgend project will benefit from a Â£1.2m grant from the UK government. Also known as district heating, the Cardiff heat network project will use underground pipes to transport waste heat from the Viridor Energy Recovery Facility to buildings in and around the Cardiff Bay area. The incinerator processes about 350,000 tonnes of non-recyclable waste per year, producing enough electricity to power 68,448 homes. The proposed pipe network for the heating project, updated in 2020 An Â£8.6m interest-free loan from the Welsh Government will provide more than half of the cash needed by Cardiff council to develop the first phase of the project, which is expected to be operational by 2022. The aim - incentivised through the Welsh Government loan - is to expand the network into the centre of the city in future phases. The Welsh Government said it was a ""small but important step"" towards its legal requirement to cut the emission of greenhouse gases by at least 80% by 2050. Environment Minister Lesley Griffiths said it would cut bills and greenhouse gas emissions ""Heat networks such as these will help home and business owners to cut their energy bills - but it will also help us to meet our goal of cutting Wales' greenhouse gas emissions,"" said Welsh Environment Minister Lesley Griffiths. Cardiff council said it was an ""exciting opportunity"" which could save 5,600 tonnes of carbon each year. The 11 buildings in Cardiff which will be heated in this way during the first phase include County Hall, the Wales Millennium Centre, Cardiff and Vale College and the Senedd - Welsh Parliament. In Bridgend, the funding will help develop a new system of distribution pipes taking excess heat from a combined heat and power plant and thermal storage facility. Cardiff council warm to incinerator heating scheme Study says ground-water could heat homes Green heating system accused of causing 'fuel poverty' This will supply heat to public buildings within the town centre and can connect to new, lower carbon heat sources in the future. Initially the scheme will serve public sector buildings in the town centre, including the Bowls Hall, the Civic Centre offices, the Bridgend Life Centre and a new residential development. Like the Cardiff project, businesses and households could be connected to the system in future phases. The UK government funding is part of its Heat Networks Investment Project, a Â£320m fund to support the construction of heat networks across England and Wales. Simon Hart said the projects would ""help heat hundreds of homes and buildings"" Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said the UK government would ""help heat hundreds of homes and buildings"" using greener energy sources. ""It also marks another step forward for our ambitious Clean Growth Strategy and moves us closer to our target of net zero greenhouse gas emissions by 2050.""

Welsh businesses 'essential' to PPE supply,"This video can not be played Welsh firms meet the challenge of producing PPE in case of a second wave A ""can-do"" attitude among businesses in Wales has made them an ""essential"" part of the PPE supply chain during the pandemic, it has been claimed. The director of a manufacturing firm which started making PPE in March said firms in Wales had been motivated to create a ""sustainable"" supply chain. The head of procurement for NHS Wales said businesses will be needed in the event of a second wave. In April, PPE supplies in Wales were down toenough for ""just a few days"". The admission came from the Welsh Government at the height of the pandemic as international competition for PPE meant delays in supply. Across the UK there were also issues with the quality of stock provided from abroad. PPE products made in Wales are of a higher quality, according to Mark Roscrow, head of procurement for the NHS Wales Shared Services Partnership Mark Roscrow, head of procurement for the NHS Wales Shared Services Partnership, said having Welsh businesses involved in production had provided ""a greater sense of assurance"". ""We don't have to stock as much as we normally would have done because we have a product we can rely on on our doorstep"" he said. He estimated there was now five times the level of PPE stock held by NHS Wales when compared with the start of the pandemic. Welsh Government figures show stocks stood at almost 130 million items at the end of July, andlast week it announced hundreds of millions of poundsof extra funding to boost levels further. Part of that supply will come from businesses who had never made PPE until the coronavirus outbreak. British Rototherm, based in Neath Port Talbot, manufactured industrial measuring instruments until mid-March when they got a call from Cardiff and Vale University Health Board, which urgently needed face shields. British Rototherm has gone from making 1,000 to more than 50,000 face shields a day, its managing director Oliver Conger says The company's managing director, Oliver Conger, said they quickly figured out how to make the face shields and delivered on the order. It soon became clear how much need there was. ""Within a couple of days the phone was off the hook,"" Mr Conger recalled. ""We started producing about 1,000 a day, then we upped that to 10,000 a day, and right now we are producing in excess of 50,000 face shields a day."" The company also moved into making face masks, and in July it was announced they would be benefitting from part ofÂ£14m in UK government fundingaimed at boosting supply of high-quality face masks. The ""can-do"" attitude of Welsh business had helped establish a PPE supply chain, Mr Conger believes Mr Conger said he was sure the location of the business was a big part of its success. ""The spirit certainly within Wales has been a can-do attitude - let's get this done, let's make it a success [and] let's have a sustainable manufacturing base for PPE."" To get its products up to the required safety standards, British Rototherm enlisted the help of the Surgical Materials Testing Laboratory in Bridgend. It is the only NHS facility in the whole of the UK able to test the full range of PPE for adherence to health and safety guidelines. The production line at Rototherm Laboratory director Pete Phillips said he believes local PPE supply is the best way to ensure quality. ""It's impossible for us to go out to audit a manufacturer in China,"" he explained. ""You have to rely on agents on the ground in China, but if it's a manufacturer of masks in Pontardawe, someone can actually go down and look at their quality management system and look at the products."" At the height of the outbreak, Mr Phillips said PPE stocks were low so the health service had to rely on less well-known or untested suppliers, which did lead to issues with quality. The laboratory found more than 60 faulty or fraudulently certified batches of PPE in the first four months of the pandemic, which Mr Phillips said was more than it had seen in the past 10 years. PPE shortage creating 'immense distress' for nurses Bodies 'may not be collected' without PPE Unions seeing hospital PPE 'horror stories' Asked whether the UK could ever supply all of its own PPE, Mr Phillips said it was ""certainly doable"", adding the country now has the same capacity for keeping prices low as the world's major manufacturers. ""In the past, people went to China because of cheap labour, but now China is moving towards a lot of automation and we can do automation here in Wales,"" he added. While being self-sufficient in terms of PPE is the aim, Mr Roscrow believes that is still ""some way off"". For now, his priority is having the stock ready for the demands of the next few months, and a potential spike in cases. ""We're taking this point in time to re-stock product to a higher level than we would have at the start of this [pandemic]. That link to Welsh-based suppliers makes it easier."" Mr Roscrow said he knows PPE is just one part of the plan to fight Covid-19, which includes an international effort to find a vaccine. He added: ""Hopefully a combination of these things will put us in a far better position to respond to a second wave."" Coronavirus PPE litter 'widespread' PPE supplies 'stable but fragile' NHS doctor 'overwhelmed' by response to visor plea Nurse 'paid ultimate price' for lack of PPE Nurse's PPE 'like soldier without combat gear' Video, 00:01:29Nurse's PPE 'like soldier without combat gear' Lack of PPE 'killing' front-line staff says union Teachers make face shields for NHS Rototherm Group CVUHB NHS Wales Shared Services Partnership 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

A further 5,800 people were admitted to hospital after being exposed to false information on social media platforms such as Facebook, Twitter and chat apps,the study said,external. The studyâs authors echoed statements from the World Health Organization (WHO), which warned the Covid-19 âinfodemicâ spread just as quickly as the virus itself. Most of the deaths and hospital admissions were the result of people drinking methanol and alcohol-based cleaning products, wrongly believing them to be a cure for coronavirus. But following advice that resembles credible medical information - such as ingesting large quantities of vitamins - can also have âpotentially serious implicationsâ, the authors say. The paper concludes that itâs down to international agencies, governments and social media platforms to fight back against this âinfodemicâ. A BBC investigation,which can be read here, found links between virus misinformation and assaults, arson and deaths. So the cluster of eight covid19 cases in the north east of Glasgow includes a number of pupils at Bannerman High School in Baillieston. Health and local environmental health staff are
working closely with the school and a number of other local businesses to
contact trace any close contacts of the cases and appropriate advice is being
advice given to these individuals. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde director of public health Dr Linda de Caestecker said:  âWe want to reassure local
people and businesses that this cluster of cases of COVID-19 is being
thoroughly investigated and managed by the NHSGGC Public Health Protection
Team. âAnyone affected will be contacted through the
Test and Protect service.  We want to reassure the wider community and
especially pupils and teachers returning to school that there is no added risk
due to this cluster. âWe also want to remind people to stay off
school or work and get tested if they experience any symptoms.â A cluster of cases of Covid-19 has been confirmed in North East Glasgow. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde's Test and Protect service has identified a
cluster of eight positive cases there, a number of whom are
pupils at Bannerman High School in Baillieston. None of the cases are experiencing anything but mild
symptoms. The school re-opened today but none of the pupils with the virus have actually
attended as they are self-isolating at home. Test and protect staff are contacting anyone
who may be affected and there is no current added risk to the wider community
due to this cluster of cases. If you are just joining us the news in Scotland today is being dominated by the death of three people in the derailment of a train near Stonehaven. Here are the headlines in terms of the conronavirus pandemic in Scotland:  This video can not be played Coronavirus: Scottish pupils returning to schools Drivetime with John BeattieBBC Radio Scotland The local lockdown imposed in Aberdeen is to remain in place. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the number of new cases in the city had fallen in recent days - but was still ""much higher"" than in other areas. She said it was therefore too early to lift any of the restrictions.

It means pubs and restaurants will remain closed, with restrictions on travel and visiting other households still in place. Stuart McPhee, the Director of the Siberia Bar & Hotel in Aberdeen says the news of the train derailment near Stonehaven has made today a sombre day. Mr McPhee says the news of the three deaths meant the lockdown extension news had been ""dwarfed somewhat"". He says it's encouraging to hear the number of Covid cases are coming down and he hopes the city can come back better. It's a tough time in the jobs market.

A-level pupils find out 'cancelled summer' results,"This video can not be played Bradley Desmier was predicted a B, C and a merit but got a D, E and a pass A-level results day in Wales has been overshadowed by claims that results for some pupils are ""utterly unfair and unfathomable"". Top grades have risen despite a chaotic summer when exams were cancelled. But more than 42% of final grades were lowered from those estimated by teachers, after the exams watchdog called them ""too generous"". The education minister has pledgedgrades would be no lower than pupils' earlier AS results. Up to 4,500 may now be given improved grades, which exam board officials have promised to do as soon as possible. There has still been strong criticism by teaching unions and some head teachers, who claim pupils were being ""short changed"" and the calculations had placed an over-emphasis on last year's AS-levels. One further education organisation has called for a review of the process. But Education Minister Kirsty Williams said she was confident the system was fair and ""very robust"". ""In any year under normal circumstances, sometimes the grades of a student... do not meet the expectations of maybe the teacher, or maybe the student and that's not different this year,"" she said. ""Clearly, I wish we had not been in a position to make last-minute changes but [students] can be absolutely confident that the exams that they have achieved today are as good as exams that were taken last year."" A pupil from Swansea looks at her results, a situation experienced by thousands around Wales How it happened: Students receive their coronavirus-hit A-level results Heads warn of 'unfair' grades for A-level students The late intervention by Ms Williams on Wednesday followed an outcry in Scotland after thousands of results were initially downgraded,sparking changes in other parts of the UK. WJEC chief executive, Ian Morgan, said he thought the system had been ""fair and balanced."" ""We probably looked at a dozen different models and it was felt, from a WJEC perspective, and signed off by Qualifications Wales, that the approach we took was the fairest in the circumstances,"" he said. Mr Morgan said there would ""inevitably"" be appeals. ""It's about ensuring that we are fair and consistent in that appeals process,"" he said. He said his organisation had done ""the best that we possibly can in the circumstances."" A record proportion of A and A* grades - 29.9%, up 2.9 percentage points from 2019. But this is less than the 40.4% estimated after the initial teacher assessments 42.2% of final A-level grades are lower than the predicted grades based on assessment, 53.7% are the same and 4.1% are higher The proportion achieving A* is 10.8% - adjusted downwards from the original estimate of 15.4% More pupils on free school meals saw their A-levels downgraded - 48.1%, compared to 45.3% for pupils not eligible 98.6% achieved passes A*-E, up 1% on 2019 The gap between boys and girls is slightly wider than last year - with A* to C grades for 76.5% of boys and 82.3% of girls 22.2% achieved an A* or A for AS-levels, up 1.9 percentage points from last year. Education Minister Kirsty Williams meets students at Merthyr College The qualifications watchdog found that the estimated grades by teachers had been too generous in Wales. If you look at the last 10 years, usually about a quarter of grades are at the very top -last year it was around 27%, when record numbers of pupils got A and A*s. But Qualifications Wales found if it had gone along with the estimates for this summer then more than 40% would have been A and A* grades. Results day rituals put on hold How will I get my exam results this year? Following the revision, the majority of students (53.7%) have been given their original assessment grade while the remainder (42.2%) get a lower grade. A small proportion get a higher grade. Altogether, 37% were downgraded by a single grade and 5% were dropped two grades. But once ministers in England and Scotland had stepped in to overrule the usual exam moderation practices it was inevitable that Wales would have to follow suit. Students who get their grades today are being told if their results are lower than their earlier AS-level grades, they will be issued with revised ones by the WJEC as soon as possible. Student's 'terrifying experience' during pandemic Paralympic ambitions for injured horse-riding teen Student's grief and Ramadan in lockdown Education expert Gareth Evans, from the University of Wales Trinity Saint David, said some students would still wonder if they might have performed better than expected. ""While it will doubtless be of some comfort to those who performed well at the halfway stage of their A-levels, it will be of scant consolation to those pinning their hopes on boosting scores at the end of the course,"" he said. ""Issues with the artificial moderation of grades allocated by teachers remains. The right of pupils to challenge their grades as appropriate is absolutely essential."" Eithne Hughes, director of theÂ ASCL Cymru union said:  ""We have received many calls from school leaders expressing their frustration, confusion, and disappointment at the results awarded to their students. ""They report that grades have been pulled down in a way that they feel to be utterly unfair and unfathomable, and they are extremely concerned about the detrimental impact on the young people concerned.""Â Â Neil Foden, a north Wales-based member of the national executive of the National Education Union, said that from his contact with schools, more than 90% of headteachers were unhappy with the grades. ""There is real concern in schools about the number of learners whose results have been downgraded from the teacher estimates,"" he said. Dilwyn Roberts-Young, of Welsh teaching union Ucac, said: ""There remains serious concern that there are many discrepancies at individual and centre level, in spite of the education minister's pledge last night. ""The last-minute changes and the results of individuals are inevitably going to create anxiety and we hope we will not see this repeated next week."" Colegau Cymru - an education charity representing further education providers - has called for an urgent review of the awarding process. It said there had been ""considerable inequalities"" in the results of individual learners. Director of development Kelly Edwards said: ""We must ensure that the grades awarded are fair and accurate so that learners can progress on their chosen path."" Qualifications Wales chief executive Philip Blaker said this year's process had not disadvantaged particular groups of pupils and the grades were ""meaningful and robust"". ""We have analysed attainment gaps this year relative to previous years - looking at aspects such as gender, age and eligibility for free school meals"", he said. ""Our analysis shows no statistically significant differences this year relative to other years."" The results show Wales has proportionately more pupils with top grades and grades A* to C than in England, but fewer than in Northern Ireland. There had also been a 3.3% rise in the proportion of A* to C grades in Wales, higher than elsewhere. And the performance at both A* to C and A*-A grades in Wales is higher than in all regions of England, apart from the south east, which is only slightly higher. Sophie Price, 18, from Bassaleg, Newport, is aiming to start a fashion buying course in London but was told online that she did not have the right grades. ""I was freaking out, I didn't know what to do,"" she said.Â ""There's not a lot of guidance on what to do - you're just left there. You can't really ring them, you have to email them and then you're waiting for an email back.Â ""Quite a lot of people I know have got lower than they were predicted.Â  Lots of people have been predicted Cs and got Us."" Sophie passed her Welsh Bac and got a D in business and E in art; she was predicted two Cs. Her art mark will be upgraded because of her AS grade last year but she will now need to appeal against her business grade, although her university said it will keep her place open for now. ""I don't have a back-up plan - I was so set on the one thing.Â ""It's a bit heart-breaking, you don't really know what else to do.Â  It's hard when your future's in the hands of other people and you have no control over it."" Caitlyn Foley said she had a ""faint idea but it went better than I was expecting"" At Merthyr College, Caitlyn Foley got an A* and three As. ""It's been a bit weird having to deal with all the changes so last minute,"" she said. ""We thought the teacher's predicted grades were final but then we found out that there was a bit more than that,"" she said. ""Obviously the announcement last night that we wouldn't get less than what we got in AS, that was a bit reassuring."" Fellow student Tom Bush, who got an A and two Bs, added: ""I've actually got lower now than I had at AS in Psychology which is odd but hopefully I'll go up."" Zac Evans may appeal his design and technology grade Zac Evans, a pupil at Ysgol Glan Clwyd, St Asaph, said he got Cs in art, design and technology, and an E in PE. ""I'm going to look into an appeal with the hope of getting a higher grade in DT because I was hoping for a B but it will all be OK in the long run. ""I've just had advice from the headmaster and they'll be releasing how the application process works on Monday because they say it's changing and I'll be looking into it."" The Welsh Joint Education Committee (WJEC) in Cardiff is the main exam board and will handle appeals Qualifications Wales has been asked to quickly make any relevant adjustments to the appeals process and liaise with other exam regulators. The advice to pupils getting results is: If your A-level grade is the same or higher than your AS-level, then no action is required. If the grade is lower it will be replaced with the same grade as that received for the AS-level - and revised grades will be issued by WJEC as soon as possible. It is believed this could involve between 3,000 and 4,500 grades. If needed, students can contact their prospective university to advise them of the change. As things stand, appeals have to be made through a school or college, rather than direct to the WJEC exam board - and there are limited grounds. These are restricted to the process - such as the exam board using the wrong data to calculate a final grade. It will not allow schools and colleges to rethink their estimated grades or ranking of pupils. If other mistakes are highlighted through an appeal, the other pupils affected will not see their grades lowered, the exam board has said. Students pose for a photograph with their A-level results at Ffynone House School in Swansea Jackie Parker, head of Crickhowell School in Powys said: ""We will all be working to look through every individual child's performance data to look at what results they've achieved and to ensure if appeals are necessary they are going forward positively. ""I think the WJEC and others have tried to be as fair as they can but I personally think there's more work to do here. ""For me, the moral purpose of leadership is to ensure that our young people are not disadvantaged in any way."" Lisa Thomas, principal of Merthyr College, said it had been a very unsettling time and results would now be closely scrutinised. ""If we feel that there are learners that have been disadvantaged in any way then we would be looking to use the appeals process,"" she said. Exams were cancelled after schools were closed in March Is there a fair way to award grades without exams? Even exams can be unfair. Some of us perform badly under exam pressure, and two people marking the same paper can give different grades. But this year's assessment had left many people feeling their future chances have been harmed by a computer model. The awarding body put in place a system that led to more than 40% of grades being downgraded to stop grade inflation. But on the eve of results day thousands of students were rescued when the Welsh Government announced students that achieved higher AS grades are entitled to have their A-level result upgraded to match. Information available to calculate grades differs across the UK: like in Northern Ireland, AS results contribute to overall A-level results in Wales and therefore can be taken into account. However, this doesn't happen in England - where AS grades have no bearing to A-level results. Research suggests that using AS performance can improve the overall accuracy of grades. It still means that if a school has a stronger year group than last year, or if teaching has improved, that might not be fully recognised this year. Grades could be calculated using a range of evidence including work to date, mock exams and teacher assessed grades, but even experts can't agree on a perfect way to navigate yet another difficult problem caused by the coronavirus. There has been concern about how the ""standardisation"" process looks at schools and colleges' previous results. In Wales, this does not apply to the process for A-levels, the Welsh Bacc and some GCSEs where you already have a lot of hard data from previous assessment - such as AS-levels - to work from. But average results from 2017-19 are taken into account when standardising most GCSEs. Schools could appeal to the WJEC if they think there were significant circumstances or events in those previous years which might bring the average down. However, currently there is no scope for pupils to appeal against the grade they were given by their school or college - the Centre Assessment Grade (CAG). If pupils have concerns about bias or discrimination in allocating those grades, they can appeal to the WJEC and a process similar to a malpractice complaint would be followed, but those are expected to be rare. In other years there can be requests for exam scripts to be reviewed, but this is obviously not an option when no exams have been taken. The minister has announced, however, that the appeal process will be free for all students. Qualifications Wales has set a 17 September deadline for initial reviews andthen a 42-day deadline for appeals to be dealt with by the WJEC exam board,external. A further independent review is possible.

Dozens of Beirut clinics non-functional after blast,"Residents of Beirut have been helping to clear up at the city's hospitals The damage caused by last week's deadly explosion in Beirut continues to hamper healthcare in the Lebanese capital. The World Health Organization (WHO) assessed 55 healthcare facilities in the city and found that half of them were ""non-functional"". Three major hospitals had to close and three more had to reduce their capacity following the blast. The WHO also warned that in some facilities Covid-19 prevention measures were not being adhered to. More than 200 people died and more than 6,000 were injured in the blast, according to the city's governor Marwan Abboud. The explosion was caused by more than 2,700 tonnes of ammonium nitrate stored unsafely at the city's port. On Tuesday, people in Beirut marked the moment the blast hit exactly a week earlier. This video can not be played Crowds in Beirut hold a minute of silence, exactly one week after a huge blast in the port area of the city There has been outrage that so much explosive material was allowed to be stored in the port. The government resigned on Monday following angry street protests. Dr Richard Brennan, the WHO's regional emergency director in the Eastern Mediterranean, said that they had assessed 55 primary healthcare clinics in Beirut. The damage in some areas is extensive and hospitals are among the buildings hit Of those, just over half were found to be ""non functional"", leaving Beirut short of 500 hospital beds as it continues to deal with thousands of injured residents. The inferno and the mystery ship Beirut explosion: Before-and-after images 'We don't have dreams any more' What we know about the blast The WHO said its priority was to get those hospitals and clinics that had closed, up and running as fast as possible. Dr Brennan said that to ensure supplies got to those who needed them, the WHO was distributing them directly to health facilities it had identified in its own assessments. He stressed the importance of restoring health facilities to their full capacity both to treat those injured and to deal with a recent surge in daily coronavirus cases. Lebanon has had 7,121 confirmed cases of coronavirus, according to health ministry figures released on Tuesday. There have been 87 Covid-related deaths. The WHO urged patients and hospital employees to follow Covid-prevention measures Dr Brennan praised Lebanon's response to the pandemic, saying it had done an ""impressive job"" tackling it. But he warned that there had been ""an uptick in the number of cases prior to the blast"". He added that the country had registered its highest number of daily cases on Tuesday. ""While we have to still continue to respond to the consequences of the blast, we also need to stay vigilant with respect to Covid,"" he urged. He said he thought it was possible to ""get on top"" of the recent acceleration in cases if the response was stepped up. Hundreds of buildings were destroyed by the blast, leaving parts of the city looking like a war zone. Many historical buildings are among those damaged. Beirut explosion: Before-and-after images On Wednesday, the authorities announced a ban on the sale of these old buildings to prevent several historical districts from being gutted by developers seeking profits. The fear is that these traditional homes could be torn down and replaced by high-rise apartment blocks as has happened in other parts of Beirut in the past. There have also been concerns that Lebanon could soon run low on bread as the silos in the port storing its grain supplies took the brunt of the blast. But the Lebanese economy minister, Raoul Nehme, tweeted that the country had enough supplies of flour for the next four months. Fixing the scars of the blast.

Netflix to stream Diana musical before Broadway debut,"Jeanna de Waal stars as Diana and Roe Hartrampf as Prince Charles Diana the musical will be streamed on Netflix next year before it makes its official Broadway debut. This is an unprecedented move for the entertainment industry which is dealing with coronavirus restrictions. Broadway theatres remain closed during the pandemic and may not reopen this year, according to experts. The musical, based on the life story of Princess Diana, is now not scheduled to open on Broadway until 25 May next year. A filmed version of the musical, featuring the original Broadway cast, will be made without an audience in New York. Netflix hasn't given a date for when this will be streamed on its site. ""Though there is no substitute for the live theatre, we are honoured to be a part of the quality entertainment that Netflix provides its subscribers worldwide,"" the producers of Diana said in a joint statement. The production, which was originally set to open this March, had been running in previews at the time of theatre shutdowns in the US. Venues signal 'red alert' for live events West End's Les Mis and Hamilton off until 2021 Vue announces phased reopening date for cinemas This is the first time a Broadway show has gone straight to the small screen before its theatrical debut. Other Broadway shows have also been streamed but only after they were performed to live audiences. The Disney+ service began streaming a filmed version of Hamilton, the runaway Broadway hit, earlier this summer. Production companies have been reluctant to release filmed versions of shows while productions are still running in theatres, let alone before they have started their run. The concern is that once audiences have seen the movie version at home, they might not want to watch the live version in a theatre. But the industry is changing its views and adapting to theatre shutdowns by looking at online alternatives. Experts say the film version can put a show on an audience's radar and gain global exposure. The film industry faces the same dilemma with many studios opting to release movies straight to streaming services rather than cinemas. Disney decided to do this for its summer blockbuster Mulan which will debut on its Disney+ TV platform bypassing US movie theatres.
