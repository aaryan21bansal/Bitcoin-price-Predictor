Trump and Putin met twice at G20,"This video can not be played Trump-Putin dinner talks highly unusual, says Ian Bremmer US President Donald Trump and Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin had another, previously undisclosed conversation at this month's G20, the White House has confirmed. They spoke towards the end of a formal dinner but the White House has not revealed what was discussed. President Trump has condemned media revelations of the talks as ""sick"". The two leaders' relationship is under scrutiny amid allegations of Russian interference in the US election. US intelligence agencies believe Moscow tried to tip the election in Mr Trump's favour, something denied by Russia. Mr Trump has rejected allegations of any collusion. Did Trump-Putin chat break protocol? Russia: The 'cloud' over the Trump White House The extra conversation happened during a private meal of heads of state at the G20 summit in Hamburg earlier in the month. The Kremlin said at the time that the two leaders had had ""an opportunity to continue their discussion during the dinner"", but the extent of the meeting was not known. Mr Trump left his seat and headed to Mr Putin, who had been sitting next to Mr Trump's wife, Melania, US media said. The US president was alone with Mr Putin, apart from the attendance of the Russian president's official interpreter. Mr Trump had been seated next to Japanese PM Shinzo Abe's wife, so the US interpreter at the dinner spoke Japanese, not Russian. No media were in attendance. Jonathan Marcus, BBC News defence and diplomatic correspondent Given the poor state of relations between Washington and Moscow and the controversy surrounding Russia's efforts to interfere with the US presidential campaign, each and every encounter between Mr Putin and Mr Trump is bound to be carefully scrutinised. Thus the apparently impromptu discussion between the two men at the G20 dinner inevitably raises many questions. What was President Trump seeking to do in approaching the Russian president? Were matters of substance discussed? If so, why was no formal note taken? And why did the US president have to rely upon a Russian official for translation? This is all highly unusual, especially at a time when relations between the two countries are laden with so many problems. Mr Trump also appeared unaware of another dimension - the message that his tete-a-tete would send to other leaders in the room, who must have watched the US president's gambit with some unease. Mr Trump's spokesperson Sarah Sanders told reporters at the White House on Wednesday that the dinner was part of the president's publicly released schedule. ""You guys came and took pictures of it,"" she told journalists. ""It wasn't like this was some sort of hidden dinner. To act as if this was some secret is just absolutely absurd."" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said the two leaders had ""exchanged opinions and phrases in the margins of the visit on more than one occasion"". ""There were no covert or secret meetings. It is absolutely absurd to claim this,"" he was quoted as saying by Russia's TASS news agency. Mr Peskov also mocked the notion that the subject of a conversation between the two men could have been kept secret, saying that is a ""manifestation of schizophrenia"". The length of the talks has been disputed. Ian Bremmer, president of the US-based Eurasia Group, who first reported them in a newsletter to clients, said: ""Donald Trump got up from the table and sat down with Putin for about an hour. It was very animated and very friendly."" This video can not be played What Trump said of his first, formal meeting with Putin No-one else was nearby, so the topics of discussion were not known, he said. Mr Bremmer had not been at the dinner but said details were given to him by unnamed attendees who, he said, were ""flummoxed, confused and startled"" by the turn of events. ""At summit meetings you have little 'pull-asides' between heads of state to discuss business all the time - a one-hour pull-aside is highly unusual in any context,"" he told the BBC. ""A one-hour pull-aside between Putin and Trump where only the Kremlin translator is there, where we don't know what's discussed, given the uniqueness of the US-Russia relationship... makes the [US] president, surprisingly and disturbingly, not credible."" In a statement, a senior White House official said there was no ""second meeting"", just a brief conversation after dinner. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The official said: ""The insinuation that the White House has tried to 'hide' a second meeting is false, malicious and absurd. It is not merely perfectly normal, it is part of a president's duties, to interact with world leaders."" National Security Council spokesman Michael Anton said: ""A conversation over dessert should not be characterised as a meeting."" Mr Trumplater said on Twitter:,external""Fake News story of secret dinner with Putin is 'sick.' All G20 leaders, and spouses, were invited by the Chancellor of Germany. Press knew!"" The dinner and its attendees have always been known. Only the Trump-Putin discussion had not been reported before. Trump and Putin: Comparing the men At the dinner, Mr Trump's wife, Melania, sat next to Mr Putin At the earlier, formal meeting, their first face-to-face encounter,Mr Trump saidhe had repeatedly pressed Mr Putin about the allegations of interference in the US vote. ""I said, 'Did you do it?' He said, 'No, I did not, absolutely not.' I then asked him a second time, in a totally different way. He said, 'Absolutely not.'"" There are congressional investigations, and one by a special counsel, into the allegations of Russian interference in the US election and possible collusion with the Trump team. On Tuesday, the Senate intelligence committee said it wanted to interview Mr Trump's son, Donald Jr, and other members of the Trump team, over a meeting they had with a Russian lawyer in June last year. Mr Trump Jrsaid he had attended the meetingwith Natalia Veselnitskaya as he was promised damaging material on Hillary Clinton, but it did not materialise. On Wednesday, Ms Veselnitskaya told Russia's RT television channel she would be willing to testify before the Senate on the matter. This video can not be played Commander in tweets: What we can learn from Trump's Twitter Judge me on four things, said Trump. So we did What has Trump said about your country? Trump's promises before and after election Meanwhile, the White House said Mr Trump would nominate former Utah governor Jon Huntsman as ambassador to Russia, a key post for a president who promised to improve relations with Moscow. Mr Huntsman, who served as ambassador to China and Singapore, needs to have his name confirmed by the Senate. The suspicions over Russian interference are likely to play a significant factor in his confirmation process, correspondents say.

'Triple sickie' policeman sacked,"This video can not be played PC Jonathan Adams called in sick but was seen on TV celebrating a win at Ascot (Footage courtesy Racing UK) A police officer who threw a ""sickie"" three times to watch horse racing has been sacked after being found guilty of gross misconduct. PC Jonathan Adams, of Ross-on-Wye, went twice to Nottingham Racecourse and to Royal Ascot where he was seen celebrating a win on television. The officer said the trips were ""therapeutic"" to deal with a ""toxic"" work environment. A disciplinary hearing concluded PC Adams was ""not as sick as he claimed"". PC Adams, an officer at Gloucester's Barton Street station, part-owned a horse with a racing syndicate. PC Jonathan Adams said trips to the races were 'therapeutic' The panel was told that in September 2015 and April 2016 he had reported in sick and went to Nottingham racecourse to watch the horse he part-owned, named Little Lady Katy. In June 2016 he reported in sick again and went to Royal Ascot to watch Quiet Reflection, another horse owned by his syndicate, win the Commonwealth Cup. The misconduct panel was shown a television clip of PC Adams jumping around and celebrating. Stephen Morley, presenting the case for the force, told the hearing: ""In a nutshell, on three occasions he deliberately reported sick in order to go to the horse races. ""We do not accept he was sick at all. He was throwing a sickie to go horse racing."" PC Adams said he had taken time off to avoid a ""toxic"" environment at Barton Street station. He described suffering stomach cramps, migraines and irritable bowel syndrome. The hearing was told it was ""quite clear"" he was ""not OK"" and was ""struggling with his environment"". Richard Shepherd, representing PC Adams, said: ""He would not have let his colleagues down to go on a jolly at the races. It is not in his DNA."" But Alex Lock, chair of the panel, said: ""We are forced to conclude that Pc Adams was not suffering the degree of sickness that he claimed he was. ""It is important that police officers are honest and that public confidence should be upheld. ""In the circumstances we conclude that dismissal without notice is appropriate in order to maintain public confidence in the force.""

Swiss glacier reveals couple lost in 1942,"Bernhard Tschannen shows where the bodies were found in the ice A shrinking glacier in Switzerland has revealed two frozen bodies believed to be of a couple who went missing 75 years ago, Swiss media report. Marcelin and Francine Dumoulin disappeared at a height of 2,600m (8,530ft) after going to tend to their cows in the Alps in August 1942. They were farmers whose seven children never gave up hope of finding them. Their youngest daughter, 79, said she was now planning to give her parents the funeral they deserved. Mr and Mrs Dumoulin were never found despite extensive searches. ""We spent our whole lives looking for them,"" Marceline Udry-Dumoulintold Lausanne daily Le Matin,external. ""I can say that after 75 years of waiting this news gives me a deep sense of calm."" A DNA test will be conducted in several days' time, police say. Who killed Oetzi the Iceman? Italy reopens coldest of cases The return of the glacier men Everest: Four bodies found in tent on Everest The diseases hidden in ice Local police said the bodies were discovered last week on Tsanfleuron glacier, above the Les Diablerets resort, by a worker from ski-lift company, Glacier 3000. Director Bernhard Tschannen said his employee found some backpacks, tin bowls and a glass bottle, as well as male and female shoes, and part of a body under the ice. Valais police said in a statement that a book, a backpack and a watch had been taken to Lausanne for forensic analysis. Mr Tschannen said that it was likely the couple had fallen into a crevasse and the way they were dressed implied that they could have been there for 70 or 80 years. ""The bodies were lying near each other. It was a man and a woman wearing clothing dating from the period of World War Two,"" he told Le Matin. The weathered belongings of Marcelin and Francine Dumoulin were also found on the Tsanfleuron glacier alongside their bodies Ms Udry-Dumoulin said her mother, a teacher, rarely went on such walks with her husband, a shoemaker, because she spent much of her adult life pregnant and it was difficult terrain. She said that she had never given up hoping that one day she would find her parents, even climbing the glacier three times to look for them. Within two months of the disappearance of her parents, she and her siblings were placed with different families, and lost contact over the years. She told Le Matin that she wanted to hold a long-awaited funeral, but would not wear black. ""I think that white would be more appropriate. It represents hope, which I never lost,"" she said. The bodies of a number of missing climbers have been discovered in the Alps in recent years. Climatologists say a rise in global temperatures is causing the ice to recede, revealing the corpses of those missing for decades.

'Fake security' at UK festivals probed,"A security firm is under investigation for allegedly supplying cloned badges to unlicensed stewards at UK festivals this summer. The Security Industry Authority (SIA) confirmed it was investigating LS Armour Security Ltd of Barry, south Wales, following a compliance check. The watchdog issues licences to bouncers and security firms. It said it was ""exceptional"" for it to comment and had taken ""unprecedented action due to public safety"". The inspection has led to two arrests and the seizure of business records, including some relating to future events with contracts for security operatives around the UK. The SIA has also written to various organisers of events and festivals that have used the firm in the past and have bookings in the future. In a statement, an SIA spokesman said: ""This type of unlawful conduct remains rare due to responsible organisers and security providers conducting appropriate due diligence. ""Nevertheless, the SIA understands that at this time of year, event organisers and primary contractors may not have sufficient SIA-licensed staff, which can lead to extensive sub-contracting. ""This provides opportunities to rogue providers that, with appropriate checks by organisers and primary contractors, can be largely mitigated."" Entertainment venues are seen as potential targets for terrorists In a letter to promoters, the SIA's deputy director said: ""If SIA-licensed staff arrive on site and are unknown to you, you must take all reasonable steps to ensure the person named on and in possession of the licence are the same person by requiring them to provide further evidence of identity. ""This will mitigate the risk of the cloned licence."" In response to the report, LS Armour Security Ltd's director Erica Lloyd told the BBC: ""As a company we have only been made aware of one arrest as a result of a cloned badge, and this individual was cautioned by police and subsequently released without charge. ""At this point this individual was contacted by LS Armour and told he would no longer be employed for any future events."" She said that the SIA's system to check whether someone holds a valid licence - the Register of Licence Holders, available on the SIA website - was ""simplistic"" and ""inadequate"". She added that this view was ""brought to the attention of an SIA representative earlier this month, although at this time and on looking at the SIA website this appears to still be the only avenue of checking available"". Ms Lloyd said LS Armour Security Ltd were ""fully complying with the SIA investigation"".

Man dies after derelict church collapses,"A man has died after being trapped under a large amount of rubble after the derelict church collapsed A man has died after being trapped in rubble when a church collapsed near a railway line in Cardiff. Firefighters, rescue dogs and a drone had been searching for the man in the wreckage of the derelict church in Splott, which collapsed at about 14:50 BST. Two people escaped from the building - which was being demolished - and were treated for minor injures. South Wales Fire and Rescue Service workers are trying to recover the body. Gareth Davies, area manager for SWFRS, said the man had been trapped under a large amount of rubble. He said: ""As a service, we wish to extend our sympathies to the individual's family at this very sad time."" Cardiff demolition firm Young Contractors, which has been working on the derelict church for about three weeks, confirmed none of its staff were on the site at the time. A report, prepared for Cardiff council in June 2016 ahead of work to replace a bridge nearby as part of rail upgrades, described the building as a ""dangerous structure"" at risk of ""imminent collapse"". Report authors Bruton Knowles warned part of the building close to the railway line was unstable and needed to be stabilised or it may ""fall"" and damage the tracks. Cardiff council leader Huw Thomas said questions would have to be asked as to how the building got into the state it did, adding it had been ""left to deteriorate for decades"". As the building collapsed a warning was sent to a train heading towards the scene, but the driver did not report anything ""untoward"" on the line, Network Rail said. However, South Wales Police has since confirmed scaffolding was on the tracks. This video can not be played Firefighter Gareth Davies said crews worked in a very ""challenging environment"" This video can not be played Cardiff council leader Huw Thomas says questions over the state of the church must be asked Officers have taped off part of Pearl Street close to the derelict church. All trains were initially cancelled between Cardiff and Newport, but two lines have now reopened. Limited services are in operation as a precautionary measure. Network Rail warned commuters rail services across the network could be affected following the incident. A Network Rail spokesman said: ""We are working with our partners, Arriva Trains Wales, Great Western Railway and Cross Country, to update passengers as and when more information becomes available."" Cardiff Central MP Jo Stevens tweeted: ""This is awful news from #Adamsdown my thoughts are with the victim's family & friends"".

Police helicopter 'spied on nudists',"Clockwise from top left: Matthew Lucas, Lee Walls, Malcolm Reeves and Matthew Loosemore A police helicopter was used to film two people ""brazenly"" having sex in their garden, a court heard. The trial of two South Yorkshire Police officers and two pilots has begun at Sheffield Crown Court. Matthew Lucas, 42, Lee Walls, 47, Matthew Loosemore, 45, and Malcolm Reeves, 64, all deny misconduct in a public office. On other occasions people sunbathing naked and naturists at a campsite were filmed, the court was told. Live updates on this story and others from across South Yorkshire Richard Wright QC prosecuting, said the crew used their ""unique viewing position [and] powerful video camera"" to film people ""in a gross violation of privacy."" The court heard that five people were filmed sunbathing naked, as well as naturists on a campsite, and a couple having sex in their garden. Former police officer Adrian Pogmore has previously admitted four charges of misconduct in a public office Pilots Mr Reeves, of Farfield Avenue, Knaresborough, North Yorkshire, denies two counts of misconduct in a public office, and Mr Loosemore, of Briar Close, Auckley, Doncaster, denies one count. Police officers Mr Walls, of Southlands Way, Aston, Sheffield, denies one count, and Mr Lucas, of Coppice Rise, Chapeltown, Sheffield, denies three counts. A fifth man, former police officer Adrian Pogmore, 50, of Whiston in Rotherham, has admitted four charges of misconduct in a public office. Footage showed a couple having sex on their patio in July 2008 and at one point the naked woman waves at the aircraft. The court was told the crew used a powerful video camera to film people Mr Wright said the couple shared Pogmore's interest in swinging and added it was ""no coincidence"" that the helicopter flew above ""while they brazenly put on a show."" The accused deny the charges and, ""in short"", blame Pogmore for what happened, Mr Wright said. A couple sitting naked by a caravan were also filmed unawares in July 2008, and the aircraft filmed a garden where a woman was sunbathing naked with her daughters in 2007. The court heard the woman felt the filming was ""a complete and utter violation of my privacy"" and added: ""It makes me feel sick to think that this took place."" In 2012 other naked sunbathers were filmed, the jury were told. Statements from all except the couple filmed having sex on the patio - who did not make a statement to police - said their privacy had been invaded. Mr Wright told the court it was a ""gross waste of valuable resource"". The trial continues and is expected to last three weeks.

'Guilt eats up' Sarah Payne brothers,"This video can not be played Brothers Lee and Luke Payne speak out about Sarah's murder The older brothers of murdered schoolgirl Sarah Payne have spoken for the first time of their guilt in not being able to save her. The eight-year-old was abducted and murdered by paedophile Roy Whiting in 2000. Speaking to Channel 5, Luke and Lee Payne said she ran ahead of them before being snatched by Whiting. Lee said: ""I did for a few years beat myself up .... that if I ran faster ... I might have caught up with her"". Sarah Payne was killed in 2000 by paedophile Roy Whiting Luke, now 28, and Lee, 30, said Sarah ran from them and sister Charlotte to a road on the edge of a field while on a day out in Kingston Gorse, West Sussex. She was not seen alive again and the brothers remember Whiting smiling at them as he drove her away. Luke, who was 12 at the time, said the thought he could have saved her ""eats you up inside"". He said he is haunted by what happened: ""I don't get a lot of sleep. I dread the night, because it's just you and your thoughts."" Paedophile Roy Whiting was jailed for life His late father, Michael, bought a sawn-off shotgun and talked to him about what he would do if Whiting was found not guilty. Luke added that when he sees Sarah's friends now: ""I always wonder where she would be... what she would be doing... whatever she would have been doing, she would have shined."" Lee, who was then 13, remembers seeing Whiting drive past the field in his van looking ""dodgy"" - smiling and waving at him seconds after the abduction. Lee said he was ""literally 30 seconds behind her"" but initially thought she was hiding. Luke Payne says he is haunted by the memory of losing his sister He said he would never get over the loss. The family lived in Hersham, Surrey, and mother Sara Payne described seeing Whiting in court for the first time and realising he ""wasn't a monster"" but a ""sad, lonely person"". Whiting was jailed for life in 2001 and will serve a minimum of 40 years. The family spoke to Channel 5 for the documentary Sarah Payne: A Mother's Story.

BBC admits quiz show banana boots slip-up,"Edmund Smith created the boots for Billy Connolly in 1975 The BBC has upheld a complaint from the daughter of a Scottish artist after Jeremy Paxman gave the wrong answer to a question on University Challenge. The quiz show host incorrectly attributed Billy Connolly's banana boots to artist John Byrne rather than their true creator Edmund Smith. Glasgow pop artist Smith made the size 9 bananas for the comedian in 1975. The BBC said it had drawn the ""oversight"" to the attention of the programme's producers. The error was made during a Christmas celebrity special of the quiz show, broadcast on 27 December 2016. During the semi final, presenter Jeremy Wade, journalist Shiulie Ghosh and Prof Jamie Angus - for the University of Kent - were asked by Paxman: ""Born in Paisley in 1940, which artist and playwright designed Billy Connolly's banana boots and wrote the 'Slab Boys trilogy' for the theatre and the series Tutti Frutti for television?"" After a few seconds deliberation, team captain Paul Ross replied: ""Nicola Sturgeon"". To which Paxman responded: ""Funny answer, but not right. John Byrne"". The University of Kent team featured Jeremy Wade, Shiulie Ghosh, Paul Ross and Prof Jamie Angus The BBC acknowledged that the answer was wrong and conceded that the correct information was widely available, including from the biography of Billy Connolly, written by his wife Pamela Stephenson. In a ruling from the Complaints Unit, the BBC said: ""The daughter of Edmund Smith complained that the answer was incorrect, her father having designed and made the boots in question. ""Evidence from several sources, including a detailed account of the matter in Pamela Stephenson's biography of Billy Connolly, confirmed that the boots had been designed and made by Edmund Smith. ""The executive producer responsible for oversight of the series drew the finding to the attention of the independent production company which makes it."" Edmund Smith's banana boots are currently on display at the People's Palace Museum at Glasgow Green.

Let Obamacare fail - Trump's new plan,"This video can not be played Trump points the finger after health bill failure President Donald Trump has said the new Republican healthcare policy should be to allow the current law to collapse. ""I'm not going to own it,"" Mr Trump told reporters of Obamacare, ""I can tell you the Republicans are not going to own it."" Support for the Republican Senate bill fell apart on Monday when two more senators said they could not back it. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer said Mr Trump was ""playing a dangerous game"" with the US healthcare system. ""He is actively, actively trying to undermine the healthcare system in this country using millions of Americans as political pawns in a cynical game"", Mr Schumer said on Tuesday. Republican Senate leader Mitch McConnell said the chamber would vote early next week on a motion for repealing Obamacare only. But with at least three Republicans against the plan B, it is probably doomed, too. Call it Mr Trump's ""Joker"" option for Obamacare repeal. Do nothing, and watch the world burn. Explaining how your dastardly plan will go down seldom works for cartoon villains, however, and it may not be the best strategy for presidents either. By telling Americans he's going to let the US healthcare system collapse in order to rally support for an eventual fix, he's essentially taking responsibility for anything bad that happens in the coming days. Despite his protestations that he won't ""own"" what happens next, he just stuffed the receipt in his pocket. Premiums go up? Insurance providers pull out of state individual markets? Democrats can say it's part of the president's plan to sabotage the system. All the while Mr Trump's opponents can point to the Congressional Budget Office's findings that, without White House meddling, the insurance markets would be relatively stable. Then again, at this point, the president has few good options. His promises to eventually work with Democrats are undermined by his pledges to defeat them at the ballot box next year. He clearly can't move forward with Republicans alone. All that's left is to walk away and hope for the worst. President Trump backed the just-repeal-it plan on Monday night but changed his tune on Tuesday morning by proposing to simply let Obamacare - which has failed to curb rising costs as insurance options dwindle - die on its own. This video can not be played President Trump won big in Kentucky last year but the state also depends heavily on Obamacare ""As I have always said, let ObamaCare fail and then come together and do a great healthcare plan. Stay tuned!"" he tweeted. He has invited all Republican senators to discuss healthcare over lunch at the White House on Wednesday. Without a replacement bill, analysts have estimated that millions of people would lose health insurance. Back to drawing board for Republicans Why is Obamacare so controversial? The party's proposed alternative includes steep cuts to Medicaid, a healthcare programme for the poor and disabled, removed the individual mandate requiring all Americans to have health insurance or pay a tax penalty and implemented a six-month lockout period for anyone who lets their health coverage lapse for more than two months. Obamacare v Republican plan compared The House of Representatives passed a similar version of the Senate bill, but slashed taxes on the wealthy used to pay for the health scheme. The Senate proposed a similar provision but was forced to ditch it amid opposition. This video can not be played Trump's battles with Obamacare - in his own words Two Republican senators, Mike Lee and Jerry Moran, came out against the bill on Monday night, saying the new legislationdid not go far enoughin repealing Obamacare. Trump country: Don't take our healthcare Why is Obamacare so popular? They joined Senators Rand Paul and Susan Collins, who had already opposed the bill. Republicans, who hold 52 seats, no longer have enough votes to approve the measure in the 100-member Senate. Moderate Republicans had also said the bill would have harmed some of their vulnerable constituents. The non-partisan Congressional Budgetary Office (CBO) found the bill would have stripped 22 million Americans of health insurance over the next decade. On top of that, polls show Obamacare has gained popularity among Americans - a survey by the Washington Post and ABC News on Monday found more than twice as many people preferred Mr Obama's programme to the proposed alternative. It is estimated Obamacare extended insurance to 20 million more Americans. Mr McConnell had hoped to push through a 2015 plan to repeal Obamacare only and give lawmakers a ""two-year, stable transition"" period to give Congress time to come up with a replacement plan. But Susan Collins, Shelley Moore Capito and Lisa Murkowski have said they will not support their party's proposal to repeal Obamacare without a replacement plan. All but two Senate Republicans, including Mrs Collins, voted in favour of the repeal plan two years ago. ""We should not give up,"" Mr McConnell said on the Senate floor Tuesday. ""Passing this legislation will provide an opportunity for senators of all parties to engage with a fresh start and a new beginning for the American people."" Earlier this month, Mr McConnell had said: ""I think repealing and then delaying the replacement doesn't work"". Judge me on four things, said Trump. So we did What has Trump said about your country?

Credit and debit card surcharges banned,"Consumers are no longer to be charged extra for paying by debit or credit card, the government has said. From January next year, businesses will not be allowed to add any surcharges for card payments. The worst offenders currently are airlines and food delivery apps, and small businesses which typically add a fee for cards. In 2010 alone consumers spent Â£473m on such charges, according to estimates by the Treasury. It follows a directive from the European Union, which bans surcharges on Visa and Mastercard payments. However the government has gone further than the directive, by also banning charges on American Express and Paypal too. Campaigners welcomed the move, saying it was great news for consumers. At the moment those booking airline tickets with credit cards pay an extra 3% with Flybe, with a minimum payment of Â£5. Customers of Ryanair and Norwegian pay 2%. However Flybe has already promised to get rid of the minimum payment, and cut its charges. Ryanair said it would comply with any changes in the law. Flybe has already promised to cut card surcharges How will the surcharge ban work? Several airlines, including Monarch and British Airways, have reduced their charges in the last year. Take-away food apps are also amongst the highest-charging businesses, the Treasury said. Both Hungryhouse and Just Eat add 50p to the bill for paying by card, although in some cases the charge may be paid by the restaurant. On a Â£10 bill, that amounts to 5%. Many local authorities also levy charges of around 2.5%.  The DVLA - which charges a flat fee of Â£2.50 for a card -will also have to change its card payment policy. Since 2012, it has made Â£42m from such fees. HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) charges up to 0.6% for payment by credit card. The change in the law is likely to mean some companies will simply put up their prices, to cover the extra costs they bear with card payments. Banks typically charge large retailers between 10p and 20p for each debit card transaction, or 0.6% for credit cards. ""Maybe they will bump the price up,"" said James Daley, the managing director of Fairer Finance, which has been campaigning for the change. ""That's fair game. You have to take customers' money somehow. And it's not reasonable to add that cost on at the end of the process. Why not put it in the headline price?"" There is also a question as to how the ban will be policed. Under theConsumer Rights Regulations,external, businesses are only allowed to charge a sum that reflects their own costs in processing a transaction. But Mr Daley said many businesses are in breach of the regulations. Some small shops charge a fee for the use of a card - but they are also have to pay more to the banks for processing such transactions. Q&A: How will the card surcharge ban work?

UK tourist and Italian die in rescue bid,"There were strong currents in the sea when the accident happened. Picture courtesy of Ostuni Notizie A British man and a beach worker have died at an Italian beach after they went to help the tourist's daughter who got into difficulties in rough seas. Italian reports say the 11-year-old girl had been playing in the sea with her grandfather at a beach at Ostuni on the south-east coast near Brindisi. When the pair struggled in a strong current, the girl's father and the local worker rushed to their aid. They too were overcome by the waves and rescuers struggled to reach them. The girl and her grandfather were eventually brought to safety. The British tourist has not been officially identified, but local media named him as 48-year-old Simon Alessandro Pearson. The UK foreign office said in a statement it was ""supporting the family of a British man following his death"". The local worker has been identified as Martino Maggi, 49. They were both rescued alive but died shortly afterwards despite attempts by rescue workers to save them,Ostuni Notizie website,externalreports (in Italian). The incident unfolded at about 10:00 (08:00 GMT) on Tuesday, at Bosco Verde beach. Officials say the sea there is notorious for a strong north-easterly wind  and local reports suggest the two men who died were unable to get back to the shore because of the strength of the current.

New plastic Jane Austen Â£10 note unveiled,"The new plastic Â£10 note has been unveiled by Bank of England governor Mark Carney at Winchester Cathedral. The note, which follows the polymer Â£5, will be issued on 14 September and has a portrait of Jane Austen on the 200th anniversary of the author's death. It is also the first Bank of England note to include a tactile feature to help visually impaired people. Meanwhile, a limited supply of a new Â£2 coin honouring Jane Austen has been put into circulation by the Royal Mint. The coin will initially only be available in tills at key locations in the Winchester and Basingstoke areas that have connections with Austen, including Winchester Cathedral and the Jane Austen House Museum. It will be circulated more widely across the UK later this year. The Â£10 note will be made of the same material as the Â£5 note, which means it also contains some traces of animal fat - an issue which caused concern for vegans and some religious groups when it was launched last September. A petition to ban the note attracted more than 100,000 signatures but the new Â£10 will again contain some tallow, which is derived from meat products. The new Â£10 note (top) is smaller than the current one The Jane Austen quote on the note from Pride and Prejudice has also attracted some unfavourable comment. The quotation: ""I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!"" is uttered by a character called Caroline Bingley who in fact has no interest in books and is merely trying to impress Mr Darcy, a potential suitor. But Mr Carney defended the choice. ""It captures much of her [Jane Austen's] spirit, at least in my mind,"" he said. ""It draws out some of the essence of some of her social satire and her insight into people's character. So it works on multiple levels."" A new polymer Â£20 featuring artist JMW Turner is due to be issued by 2020, but there are no plans to replace the current Â£50 note, which was released in 2011. The Bank of England says the new Â£10 notes contain sophisticated security features and are expected to last five years, which is two-and-a-half times longer than the current note. A see-through window featuring the Queen's portrait. Winchester Cathedral shown in gold foil on the front of the note and silver on the back. A quill at the side of the window which changes from purple to orange. A hologram which contains the word ""Ten"" and changes to ""Pounds"" when the note is tilted. A hologram of the coronation crown which appears 3D and multi-coloured when the note is tilted. A book-shaped copper foil patch which contains the letters JA. Micro-lettering beneath the Queen's portrait with tiny letters and numbers that are visible under a microscope. The words ""Bank of England"" printed in intaglio (raised ink) along the top of the note. The tactile feature was developed in conjunction with the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) and is a series of raised dots in the top left-hand corner of each note. Bank notes are already in tiered sizes, and have bold numerals, raised print and differing colours to help blind and partially sighted people. Launching the note in Winchester Cathedral, Austen's final resting place, Mr Carney paid tribute to the author, saying: ""The new Â£10 note celebrates Jane Austen's work. Austen's novels have a universal appeal and speak as powerfully today as they did when they were first published."" Why Jane Austen is trending 200 years on Victoria Cleland, the Bank's chief cashier, said: ""The new Â£10 note marks the next exciting step in our introduction of cleaner, safer, stronger polymer banknotes, and I am grateful to the cash industry for their work towards a smooth transition."" The design of the note includes the quote ""I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!"" from Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice and a portrait of the novelist based on an original sketch drawn by her sister Cassandra. This video can not be played Jane Austen ""would have been gobsmacked"" by the new Â£2 coin and Â£10 note says biographer Meanwhile, the Austen Â£2 coin, designed by Royal Mint graphic designer Dominique Evans, features Austen's silhouette, set in a period frame against a backdrop of Regency wallpaper. Ms Evans said: ""I imagined Jane Austen's framed silhouette as if it were in one of the houses featured in her books, on the wall of a corridor as guests passed by to attend a dance, perhaps in Pride and Prejudice, or on the wall in the home of Emma."" Austen had her first novel Sense and Sensibility published anonymously in 1811 at the age of 35. The Bank of Scotlandunveiled the design of its new plastic Â£10 noteat the end of May. Featuring Scottish novelist and poet Sir Walter Scott alongside The Mound in Edinburgh on the front and the Glenfinnan Viaduct on the back, it also has a picture of a steam locomotive hauling a heritage tourist train. The note is due to come into circulation in the autumn.

Remarkable life of Japan's centenarian doctor,"Shigeaki Hinohara was a well known and highly respected figure in Japan Shigeaki Hinohara, one of Japan's most famous doctors, has died at the age of 105. Dr Hinohara continued seeing patients until months before his death and frequently offered advice on how to live well. Described by his colleagues as Japan's national treasure, he headed five foundations in addition to being the president of St Luke's International Hospital in Tokyo. Here are some highlights from his remarkable life. Dr Hinohara began his working life as a doctor at St Luke's in the 1940s. During the war he helped to treat victims of the firebombing that destroyed large parts of the Japanese capital. Much of Tokyo was destroyed by bombing in World War Two In 1970 Dr Hinohara was a passenger on a Japan Airlines plane hijacked by the communist militant group, the Japanese Red Army. The hijackers, who were armed with swords and pipe bombs, took 129 hostages on the flight from Tokyo to Fukuoka, later releasing them at Fukuoka and the South Korea capital Seoul before flying on to North Korea where they were offered political asylum. In a 2008 interview with the Japan Times, Dr Hinohara said the hijackers had explosives strapped to them ""and we were terrorised, wondering whether the negotiations might break down"". A great music lover, Dr Hinohara, at the age of 88, wrote a script for a Japanese musical entitled The Fall of Freddie the Leaf. The show was first performed in 2000 and Dr Hinohara also acted in the production, dancing with children, the Japan Times reported. Dr Hinohara frequently appeared on Japanese television, urging audiences to have more fun in their lives and to ward off illness by always giving themselves something to look forward to. On TV and through a best-selling anthology of essays called How to Live Well, he encouraged others to do away with strict rules on when to eat and sleep. One of his last pieces of advice was; always take the stairs and keep up your strength by carrying your own bags. Dr Hinohara believed in keeping an active social life. He met Japanese Empress Michiko at this concert in 2016 ""We all remember how as children, when we were having fun, we often forgot to eat or sleep,"" he once said. ""I believe we can keep that attitude as adults - it is best not to tire the body with too many rules such as lunchtime and bedtime."" In 1954 Dr Hinohara introduced Japan's system of comprehensive annual medical check-ups - called ""human dry-dock"" - which have been credited with greatly contributing to the country's longevity. He was also a strong advocate of maintaining an active social life into old age. Dr Hinohara became director of St Luke's in the early 1990s and, according to the Japan Times, had oxygen tubes installed  throughout the building in 1994 to prepare for mass casualties if an earthquake struck the capital. The next year, a sarin gas attack on Tokyo's metro by members of a cult killed at least 12 and injured thousands but the hospital was able to cope with the number of patients because of Dr Hinohara's preparations, the Times says. Many tributes have been paid to Dr Hinohara, including by the Japan Times journalist Judit Kawaguchi, who knew him well. She told the BBC World Service World Update programme,externalthat he had amazing energy and drive. ""I met him when he was already in his 90s and I would say he drastically changed my mind about ageing because even then he was working 18 hours, seven days a week, and he was the most energetic person I've ever met,"" she said. ""He believed that life is all about contribution, so he had this incredible drive to help people, to wake up early in the morning and do something wonderful for other people. This is what was driving him and what kept him living."" She added: ""He always had today's goals, tomorrow's and the next five years. I feel very sad that he died because his dream was to attend the Olympics in Tokyo in 2020. That was his next big goal and he couldn't make it. ""But he was just an amazing, amazing person and everybody who met him was transformed because of him."" The 105-year-old still working - How? Video, 00:01:28The 105-year-old still working - How?

Viewpoint: Is there such a thing as 'flying ant day'?,"The emergence of winged ants during summer often provokes a strong public reaction We're all used to ants sprouting wings and taking to the air during summer, but is there really such a thing as a ""flying ant day""? A new study appears to have solved the mystery, using data submitted by the public. Here, Prof Adam Hart, one of the report's authors, explains how they did it. No one can guarantee a rain-free Bank Holiday weekend or a sun-drenched Wimbledon but, no matter what the summer weather brings, you can guarantee that flying ants will make their annual appearance at some point. Flying ants are a bit of a surprise for many people. After all, the ants we are used to seeing under stones in our gardens don't have wings and cannot fly. These wingless ants are female workers, toiling to ensure the colony survives and grows. Once the colony has grown large enough though, it can stop investing in growth and start investing in reproduction. The problem for ants is that workers cannot start a new colony; for that you need a larger, fertile, ""queen"" ant that has mated with a male from a different colony. The flying ants we see in the summer are these potential new female queens and male ants embarking on a mating flight. Once they have mated, on the wing, the females drop to the ground and attempt to start a new colony. Most of them will not make it, becoming bird food or dying before they are able to produce worker ants (their daughters) and develop a new colony. But some will go on to head up new colonies that will eventually produce their own flying ants Once ants have mated, females drop to the ground in attempts to start new colonies The mass emergence of these winged ants across the UK always seems to provoke a strong public and media reaction, but rather than celebrating one of the great spectacles of nature, it seems that most people would much rather it didn't happen at all! Reading social media feeds during a flying ant event is a lesson in insect-hating, with words like ""disgusting"", ""horrible"" and ""invasion"" being typical. The term ""flying ant day"", with its implication of a single mass flying event across the country, is virtually ubiquitous. The emergence of flying ants certainly does give the impression that these mating flights are coordinated across the whole country, and the collective media reporting of them lends weight to the idea that there is a single flying ant day. But is there really such a day, how coordinated are these flights across the country and what triggers the ants to take to the air on the day or days that they do? These were questions I set out to answer with a team from the University Gloucestershire and the Royal Society of Biology. It turns out that the widely-held idea of a ""flying ant day"" is actually a misconception. Investigating mass events like flying ants presents scientists with a problem; to find out more about what is happening we need to record when and where flying ants are emerging but to do that means being everywhere at once. With the advent of the internet, and especially the rise of smart phones, scientists have been able to harness the power of the public, who are more-or-less everywhere all the time, to record events for them. Citizen science, as such scientist-public partnerships have become known, is an increasingly powerful tool being used in all corners of science. We decided to harness the power of the public to find out more about flying ants. Whether ants flew seemed to be determined both by temperature and wind speed Starting in 2012 and continuing for three years, the University of Gloucestershire and the Royal Society of Biology, ran an annual online Flying Ant Survey to find out where and when people were seeing flying ants. After the first year, we also asked some people, ""super-engagers"" who were keen on doing more, to send us samples of the flying ants from their sightings. Using the thousands of ants returned to us we were able to determine that close to 90% of flying ants were from just one species - the black pavement antLasius niger. We were also able to use the thousands of sightings to say once and for all that the media clichÃ© of Flying Ant Day is a myth. In fact, what the public-reported data showed us was that flying ants are much less coordinated across space and much less synchronised than we thought. We found that ants were flying somewhere in the UK on as many as 96% of days between the start of June and the start of September. The pattern of flying ants differed massively between years. For example, in 2012 there were just a few days in late July and a few more in mid-August where around 80% of the flying activity was focussed. In 2012, there was a terrible patch of wet and cold weather at the end of July which seems to have concentrated flights in the periods before and after. But in other years we found very different patterns, for example the fine weather in 2013 resulted in ""pulses"" of ant flights across the country every few weeks throughout the summer. We had expected to find flights clustered together geographically when we looked at records across the country but we found that flying ants were much less coordinated than we expected, with no clustering at any level at which we looked. You might have flying ants in your garden one day and your neighbour might have them the week, or even the month, after. Even in your own garden, you might have one colony flying today and another tomorrow. Although only a small effect, we did find that flying ant emergences move northwards and westwards across the UK over time, so those early flying ants in Wimbledon (the south-east) this year are exactly what we might expect, albeit a couple of weeks earlier than has been reported previously. Weather turns out to be an absolutely critical factor in triggering ants to fly. By comparing records of flying ants with the nearest weather station data, we were able to untangle some of the factors that trigger ants to take to the sky. Ants only flew when the temperature was above 13C and when the wind speed was less than 6.3 metres per second but overall ants like it calm and warm. During the course of the study, every day in the UK summer that had a mean temperature above 25C had ants flying somewhere. The records sent in by the public also showed that ants are excellent at short-term weather forecasting. By examining the changes in weather in the days before and after each flying ant event, we discovered that ants were more likely to fly on days that were warmer and had lower wind speeds than the day before. It seems that ants are able to judge if the weather is likely to get better or deteriorate. If the weather is going to improve then they will wait, but if it is going to deteriorate then as long as the temperature and wind speed are above their critical thresholds they will fly. Ants are incredibly important in the ecosystem. As predators they keep on top of other insects and as prey (especially flying ants) they feed many birds and mammals. Their nest digging helps to aerate and structure soil as well as acting to cycle nutrients. Thousands of people have helped to make sure the emergence of flying ants, forecasting the weather and evading hungry gulls, can be celebrated as a highly visible sign of these vital ecosystem engineers. This research, by Adam Hart (the author of this article), Anne Goodenough (University of Gloucestershire), Thomas Hesselberg (University of Oxford) and Rebecca Nesbit (Royal Society of Biology) is published in the journal Ecography.

Refugee doctors get back to work,"Refugee doctor Rouni Youssef with his mentor Dr Sue Jones and an elderly patient A pioneering scheme that aims to harness the skills of refugees fleeing conflict and unrest in their home countries could help boost health services in north-east England. Middlesbrough has the highest number of asylum seekers in the UK. Around one in every 186 people in the town is seeking refugee status, well over the government guidelines of no more than one in every 200 of the local population. But many of the refugees are skilled professionals such as doctors or pharmacists, skills that happen to be in short supply in the area. I have been to meet the foreign doctors who are participating in the scheme. Unable to practise their profession at home, they are embracing the opportunity to use their skills in an understaffed NHS. Rouni Youssef, 27, picks up a patient's notes from the trolley outside the curtained cubicle and begins to thumb through the details. ""Interesting,"" he mutters to himself. ""I think we should do an MRI."" I ask him what the day ahead on the hospital ward is looking like but Dr Youssef does not hear me. He is focused on the medical details before him, his eyes flicking feverishly over the scans like a sleuth over clues. ""Maybe some kidney malfunction here,"" he says. Dr Rouni Youssef is currently on an unpaid clinical placement Dr Youssef is polite and friendly towards me but I know I am holding him back from what he would rather be doing. It is, after all, what he has dreamed of doing all his life and what he has spent so many years training to do. ""I'm a Kurd from Aleppo,"" he shrugs. ""And I'm a medical doctor but it just became too unsafe to stay in Syria and in 2014, I had to flee. ""I ended up here in Middlesbrough with nothing: no friends, no family and no career. I couldn't be a doctor any more. You can't imagine how that feels. It was like someone had cut off a body part. ""I was nothing and I had to start from scratch."" But thanks to the scheme run by the North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Trust and a refugee charity called Investing in People and Culture, Dr Youssef once again is sporting a stethoscope around his neck. He is currently on an unpaid clinical placement at the University Hospital of North Tees but he has just taken the second part of his Plab exams (an assessment conducted by the General Medical Council which all overseas doctors from outside the EEA must pass before they can legally practise medicine in the UK). If he passes, he will start applying for jobs in September. ""I'd love to be a consultant paediatrician,"" he admits shyly. ""Babies are such dear little creatures - they're like angels, you know?"" Dr Jane Metcalf says the pilot scheme is a ""win-win situation"" Dr Jane Metcalf, deputy medical director at the hospital, pops down to the ward to find out how his latest exams have gone. She describes the Resettlement Programme For Overseas Doctors as primarily a humanitarian project to get skilled healthcare professionals back into practice but she also admits that, since the North East has a shortage of qualified doctors, it is also in the trust's interests to use their refugee resources. The current scheme comprises 11 doctors and one pharmacist, from Syria, Afghanistan, Iraq, Iran, Yemen, Sudan, Pakistan and the Congo. ""It's a win-win situation,"" Dr Metcalf explains. ""Although the training is rigorous, the cost is low... to help the doctors through their exams and English tuition it's about Â£5,000 per doctor and when you compare that to the Â£250,000 it takes to train someone in the UK through medicine, it's pretty cost-effective. ""If we can get doctors like Rouni back into practice within a year that would be a tremendous achievement."" The biggest hurdle for the doctors though is passing the extremely high level, but requisite, English exam. In an upstairs room at Middlesbrough library, the other doctors on the pilot scheme are learning about the inappropriate use of colloquial English in the written form. Everyone is grumbling about the finicky example on the white board which, despite being a native speaker and having a university degree in English, even makes me pause for thought. Eli (L) and Ahmad (R) are among those on the scheme studying for the extremely rigorous English exam Eli, a GP from Congo, has had a long and difficult battle to win refugee status and was unable to join the scheme until his asylum papers were granted. While waiting however, he volunteered for the Alzheimer's Society and is now determined to work in geriatric medicine. ""We are refugees, yes,"" he smiles. ""But we are doctors too. We don't take this opportunity for granted. Before this programme we had no road, no route. Now we have hope again. And we can give something back."" Ahmad, from Afghanistan, was just months away from completing his medical training as a specialist in paediatric orthopaedics when his life was threatened by the Taliban, forcing him and his family to flee Kabul. ""Now I'm optimistic for the future,"" he says. ""I know that one day soon I will practise my passion again."" Outside the library I meet Bini Araia, founder of Investing in People and Culture, the charity working in partnership with North Tees and Hartlepool NHS Trust. He tells me that before the scheme's existence, many of the refugee surgeons and doctors, under pressure from their local job centre, were resigned to a life in the UK working in factories, garages or supermarkets. ""But we have a ready-made skill set!"" he tells me. ""And it's great to show with this programme that refugees can benefit UK society."" The programme shows refugees can benefit UK society, says IPC founder Bini Araia Back on the ward at the hospital, there are no ""baby angels"" for Dr Youssef to treat today. Instead, his mentor, consultant physician Dr Sue Jones, asks him to join her as she examines an elderly patient who has been complaining of acute hip pain. Dr Youssef jogs eagerly to the patient's bedside. ""Well hello sir!"" he beams. ""And how are you feeling today? Is it really true you're 101?"" He squats down and holds the man's hand, joking with him and reassuring him. I catch Dr Jones's eye. ""Isn't he impressive?"" she mouths delightedly. Dr Metcalf wants to encourage other NHS trusts to implement the resettlement scheme for refugee doctors, something Dr Youssef welcomes. ""When I first walked back on to the ward,"" he remembers, ""it felt like I had been fasting for 18 hours and then someone gave me a sip of cold, delicious water."" We walk together to the Rapid Assessment clinic. ""I want to be a doctor here in Middlesbrough,"" he continues, ""because the people are so friendly."" Then he grins.""But the local accent here, it's a bit, um, fresh, isn't it?"" Emma Jane Kirby reports forBBC Radio 4's World at Oneprogramme.

Why brawls are a way of life in Taiwan politics,"This video can not be played After a huge brawl on Thursday last week, fighting has resumed in Taiwan's parliament On the outside, the main building of Taiwan's Legislative Yuan - or parliament - is a picture of calm. Two rows of neatly-trimmed shrubbery and trees line the courtyard leading to the stately-looking, white building with a Republic of China (Taiwan) flag on top. But inside, the picture is very different. In fact, while parliamentary brawls occur occasionally in other countries, Taiwan's Legislative Yuan is notorious for them. Scuffles are common in Taiwan's Legislative Yuan - but they are getting uglier Rowdy and sometimes violent scuffles occur as often as several times a year and even every few days or weeks. Punching, hair pulling, throwing plastic bottles and water balloons, as well as splashing cups of water on the faces of rival party legislators are common scenes. Air-horns and filibustering - more like shouting - are also used to drown out one's opponents. 23 March 2004:A scuffle erupted between the ruling and opposition party members over vote recounts from the presidential election. 7 May 2004:Legislator Zhu Xingyu grabbed legislator William Lai and tried to wrestle him onto a desk and headbutt him, and jabbed him in the stomach, due to disagreements over legislative procedures. 26 October 2004:A food fight took place between the opposition and ruling party during a debate on a military hardware purchase ordinance. 30 May 2006:Then opposition Democratic Progressive Party (DPP) legislator Wang Shu-hui snatched a written proposal and shoved it into her mouth to prevent voting on allowing direct transportation links with Mainland China. Ruling party members tried to force her to cough it up by pulling her hair. She later spat it out but tore it up. 8 May 2007:Several members of the ruling DPP and opposition Kuomintang (KMT) party fought over control of the Speaker's podium, with some throwing punches and spraying water over an alleged delay of the annual budget. At least one person was admitted to hospital. However this month's fights have become even uglier. Last Thursday, legislators lifted up and threw chairs at each other when they brawled over the ruling DPP's massive $29bn (Â£22bn) infrastructure spending bill, which the opposition (headed by the KMT) claims benefits cities and counties loyal to the DPP and is aimed at helping the party win forthcoming elections. The fighting continued on Tuesday in a legislative committee meeting. The opposition KMT legislators wrestled DPP members to the floor and unplugged the cables of loud speakers to prevent the DPP from putting the bill through a committee review to move it towards passage into law. Watch: Taiwan MPs in nuclear brawl Watch: Fight breaks out in row over tax Opposition parties, a minority in the 113-seat parliament, see physical fights as the only way to stop legislation they oppose, by blocking them from being voted on. The standoffs can last for hours, even into the middle of the night. Legislators take turns eating or delay meals. Many staff from local governments, ministries or government agencies have to be there, to see if legislation that affects them might pass, or to be on hand to answer questions in case there is actual discussion and debating, not just brawling. These people find ways to put up with the chaotic scenes. Some cover their ears, others focus on their smartphones, and a few smart ones find the most comfortable couches in the back and manage to sleep through it all. It's become a normal part of Taiwan's democracy - one of the most vibrant in the world. Parties see parliamentary fights as an effective way to prevent the passing of legislation But the fights shouldn't be taken too seriously, says a local journalist who covers parliament on a daily basis. He wished to be identified only by his first name. ""The legislators are partly acting - trying to show their constituents they're working hard to fight for their cause,"" said Danny. However, he and other Taiwanese people say the brawls - with some broadcasted worldwide - are humiliating and do not advance democracy. ""The fights only allow the people to see the surface, not real issues. People often don't even understand the bills,"" said Danny. He admitted that many journalists don't either. This current infrastructure bill is 10,000 pages long; it's impossible for them to read through all of it. ""If the legislators actually debate the contents of the bill instead of fight, the public might understand it better,"" said Danny. ""I majored in politics in college. This is not what I had expected."" Punches thrown in S Africa parliament. Video, 00:01:16Punches thrown in S Africa parliament Brawl breaks out in Taiwan parliament.

The history of allegations against R Kelly,"R Kelly has faced accusations of sexual misconduct since the 1990s For more than two decades, chart-topping R&B singer R. Kelly had faced allegations of sexual abuse. The accounts went back to the start of his career in the 1990s, with many centring on the predatory pursuit of teenage girls. In 2022, he was jailed for 30 years after being found guilty of eight counts of sex trafficking and one of racketeering in a New York court. Months later, he was convicted of child sexual abuse in a second federal trial in Chicago. The singer - whose real name is Robert Sylvester Kelly - is also due to face sexual misconduct charges Minnesota. Kelly was himself the victim of child sex abuse, and detailed in his autobiography how he was raped by a female family member when he was eight years old. Here is a history of the accusations against him. Kelly, then aged 27, wed 15-year-old singer Aaliyah at a secret ceremony in Chicago. Vibe magazine later discovered Aaliyah hadlied  about her age on the wedding certificate,external, listing herself as 18. The marriage was annulled in February 1995. A former tour manager for Kelly testified at his trial that he bribed a government worker in 1994 to obtain a fake ID for Aaliyah - so the singers could marry. For the rest of her career, Aaliyah dodged questions about the nature of her relationship. ""When people ask me, I tell them, 'Hey, don't believe all that mess,'"" she told one interviewer. ""We're close and people took it the wrong way."" Kelly wrote and produced Aaliyah's debut album, calling it Age Ain't Nothing But A Number Kelly rarely spoke about Aaliyah after she died in a plane crash in 2001. She is not mentioned in his autobiography, where an author's note explains  ""certain episodes could not be included for complicated reasons"". In a 2016 interview with GQ magazine, he described their relationship as ""best, best, best, best friends"", but declined to comment on their marriage, saying: ""I will never have that conversation with anyone. Out of respect for Aaliyah, and her mother and father who have asked me not to personally."" Tiffany Hawkins sued R. Kelly for the ""personal injuries and emotional distress"" she suffered during a three-year relationship with the star. In court documents, she said she began having sex with Kelly in 1991, when she was 15 and he was 24, and the relationship ended when she turned 18. According to the Chicago Sun Times, Ms Hawkins sought $10m in damages but accepted a fraction of that amount ($250,000) when the case was settled in 1998. Kelly's spokeswoman said she had ""no knowledge"" of the accusations. Kelly continued to release successful songs, and win major awards, as accusations accumulated around him Tracy Sampson sued R. Kelly, accusing him of inducing her ""into an indecent sexual relationship"" when she was 17. The woman, a former intern at Epic Records, said she was ""treated as his personal sex object and cast aside"". ""He often tried to control every aspect of my life including who I would see and where I would go,"" she said. The case was settled out of court for an undisclosed sum, according to theNew York Post,external. Kelly is sued by Patrice Jones, a Chicago woman who claimed he impregnated her when she was under age, and that she was forced to have an abortion. Montina Woods also sued Kelly, alleging that he videotaped them having sex without her knowledge. The recording was allegedly circulated on a ""sex tape"" sold by bootleggers under the title R. Kelly Triple-X. The singer settled both cases out of court, paying undisclosed sums in return for non-disclosure agreements. He is charged with 21 counts of making child sexual abuse videos involving various sexual acts. Chicago police accused him,externalof taping the acts and enticing a minor to participate in them. All the charges related to one girl, born in September 1984. His arrest stemmed from a video that was sent anonymously to the Chicago Sun Times earlier in the year. They passed it on to police, who verified its authenticity with help from FBI forensic experts. Kelly, who posted $750,000 bail, immediately denied the charges in an interview with MTV and later pleaded not guilty in court. It took six years for the case to come to trial, during which time Kelly released his wildly successful Trapped In The Closet album and was nominated for an Image Award by the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People), prompting widespread criticism. The jury eventually concluded they could not prove that the girl on the tape was a minor, and Kelly was found not guilty on all counts. Kelly was charged with a further 12 counts of producing child sexual abuse images in Florida, where he was arrested at his holiday home. These charges came after police seized a camera during the arrest, which allegedly contained images of him having sex with an underage girl. The charges were dropped when a judge agreed with Kelly's defence team that police lacked sufficient evidence to justify a search. A long and detailed Buzzfeed report,externalaccused R. Kelly of trapping six women in a sex ""cult"". The article alleged that Kelly seduced young women when they approached him for help with their music careers, before taking control of their lives - dictating ""what they eat, how they dress, when they bathe, when they sleep, and how they engage in sexual encounters that he records"". Kelly also confiscated the women's mobile phones, the report said, barring contact with friends and family. The allegations came from three former employees and the parents of several women, who said their daughters had all but vanished. Buzzfeed's report prompted further allegations. Jerhonda Pace broke a non-disclosure agreement,externalto speak about having sex with Kelly while she was underage. Another woman, Kitti Jones,claimed the star,externalstarved her, coerced her into sexual encounters with other women and physically abused her. Ms Pace would go on to testify against Kelly in the 2021 trial. Ms Kitti, along with other members of R. Kelly's inner circle, also spoke to aBBC Three documentaryin March 2018. One former friend and collaborator, Lovell Jones, said Kelly asked him to scout out women ""that looked young"" at parties, and claimed that it was ""common knowledge"" that the singer preferred young girls. The #MuteRKelly campaign lobbied record label RCA to sever ties with the singer. They also targeted concert promoters, ticket sellers and streaming services - with Spotify, Apple Music and Pandora all agreeing to demote Kelly's songs from their playlists (a decision that was later reversed). Around the same time, the star'slawyer, publicist and personal assistant all quit- although attorney Linda Mensch said her departure was ""unrelated to any allegations related to Mr Kelly's social life"". Kellycontinued to perform livedespite protests outside his shows, and was filmed saying the campaign against him was ""too late"". ""Only God can mute me,"" he sang defiantly on a song called I Admit. ""Am I supposed to go to jail or lose my career because of your opinion?"" Meanwhile,the star was suedby a former partner who said he ""intentionally"" infected her with a sexually transmitted disease. Over the course of six hour-long episodes, Lifetime documentary Surviving R. Kelly presented the most comprehensive look yet at the allegations against the musician. Two weeks after the programme was broadcast, Kelly was dropped by his record company. Planned concerts in the US and New Zealand were cancelled. In February, celebrity lawyer Michael Avenatti said he had obtained a video showing Kelly having sex with a 14-year-old girl. Weeks later,Kelly was chargedin Chicago with 10 counts of aggravated criminal sexual abuse. He pleaded not guilty and gave ahistrionic TV interview. This video can not be played R. Kelly in tearful sex abuse charges interview Prosecutors later filed an additional 11 charges of sexual assault and abuse against a minor aged between 13 and 16. The charging documents described sex and oral sex with a minor ""by the use of force or threat of force"". The accuser was thought to be one of the women featured in Surviving R. Kelly, who said she met the singer during a previous trial. R. Kelly appears for a hearing at Leighton Criminal Court Building in Chicago, Illinois Kelly was hit withtwo separate federal indictmentsin Illinois and Brooklyn. Combined, the allegations depicted an organised effort from the singer and his associates to recruit and transport underage girls over state lines for illegal sexual purposes, including the production of child sex abuse images, as well as conspiracy to obstruct justice by destroying evidence and bribing or threatening witnesses. Prosecutors in Minnesotafiled prostitution chargesagainst R. Kelly, meaning he faced criminal cases in three US states. He was accused of soliciting a teenager who asked him for an autograph in 2001. Kelly allegedly invited the 17-year-old to his hotel room and offered her $200 (Â£164) to undress and dance with him. Kelly's lawyer said the charges were ""beyond absurd"". R. Kelly in court in September 2019 Towards the end of August, Kelly was attacked in his sleep by a fellow inmate in Chicago's Metropolitan Correctional Centre. His lawyer called for his immediate release, saying ""the government cannot ensure his safety"". However, the request - along with numerous other attempts to get Kelly released on bail - was denied. In the last pre-trial hearing before Kelly's trial, US District Judge Ann M Donnelly made a series of rulings to narrow down what evidence could be shown to jurors. During the hearing, she asked one of the singer's lawyers whether they denied the star had sexual relations with Aaliyah while she was underage. According to the Associated Press, Thomas A Farinella ""let out a deep sigh and responded, 'No.'"" The trial began on 18 August in New York. Read more about the trial: The testimony that convicted R. Kelly R Kelly trial: A look at the key moments On 27 September, following two days of deliberation,the jury found R. Kelly guiltyon all nine counts. Gloria Allred, a lawyer who represented several victims, told reporters: ""I've been practising law for 47 years. During this time, I've pursued many sexual predators who have committed crimes against women and children. ""Of all the predators that I have pursued, Mr Kelly is the worst."" A man wassentenced to eight years in prisonafter intimidating a witness before Kelly's New York trial. In June 2020, Michael Williams set fire to a car belonging to the father of a witness who was due to testify in order to ""prevent the victim-witness from continuing to co-operate"", according a statement from the attorney's office in New York. ""Williams attempted to use violence and intimidation to divert the course of justice and prevent a victim's voice from being heard,"" they said. Kelly was sentenced to 30 years in prison for using his celebrity status to sexually abuse children and women. US District Judge Ann Donnelly said the singer had an ""indifference to human suffering"" and had used sex as a weapon, forcing his victims to do unspeakable things while saddling some with sexually transmitted diseases. ""You taught them that love is enslavement and violence,"" she said. Some of the women who were abused by the singer described how he had ""destroyed so many people's lives"" as they addressed him in court before he was sentenced. Lawyers for Kelly said he would appeal. Kelly had a ""dark"" and ""hidden"" side that the public rarely saw during his career, prosecutors said at the opening of his second federal trial. The singer was on trial in his home town, Chicago, for child pornography, obstruction of justice and other charges. A woman at the heart of the trial testified that the R&B singer had sex with her ""hundreds"" of times before she turned 18. The 37-year-old woman, known as Jane, said improper contact with Kelly began when she was just 13. His lawyers insisted he was not ""a monster"" and deserves a fair trial. The disgraced star was found guilty of child sexual abuse in his second federal trial. The jury convicted him on six out of 13 counts, including three of child pornography, after the four-week Chicago case. He was acquitted of a charge of conspiring to obstruct justice, related to his 2008 child pornography trial. R. Kelly's former manager was sentenced to 20 months in prison for stalking and harassing one of the singer's victims. Donnell Russell pleaded guilty in July to using threats and intimidation to silence one of the women Kelly abused. Using an alias, he published explicit photos of her online in an attempt to stop her testifying against his client. A Chicago prosecutor said she was dropping sexual abuse and assault charges dating back as far as 1998 against Kelly, who was already facing decades in prison. Cook County State's Attorney Kim Foxx said her office ""will no longer be pursuing these indictments"", adding: ""Sometimes justice is served even when there is no conviction."" A Chicago judgesentences Kelly to 20 years in prison, following the 2022 trial in which a jury found he had enticed minors for sex and produced child sexual imagery. However, in a victory for the singer's lawyers, the judge said that all but one of those years would be served at the same time as his previous 30-year prison sentence. The judge said he would have dealt a heftier sentence if the Chicago trial had come first.

Death blow for Obamacare repeal,"Is this the end of the repeal-and-replace war? In the end the death blow to the latest iteration of Obamacare repeal came from the right flank. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell was always going to have to walk a fine line in his effort to keep both moderates and hardcore conservatives in the party on board with his healthcare reform proposal. After his first draft failed to garner sufficient support, he came out with a new version that moved farther to the right in key areas while throwing money to keep the moderates satiated. That strategy worked in the House, where Freedom Caucus arch-conservatives and just enough moderates came around to rescue the legislation from death's doorstep. In the Senate, the entire rickety structure came tumbling down. Mike Lee of Utah and Jerry Moran balked, citing insufficient tax and regulation rollbacks. Expect a stampede for the exits in the coming days, as everyone abandons what was always an unpopular bill. On Monday night the president himself led the way, calling for repeal without so much as a plan for what to do next. Then again, the Republican Party never really had a replacement plan, and its attempts to craft one on the fly - something that would perform better than Obamacare while costing less money - were like one of those hapless early airplane designs that flapped its wings or spun its wheels but never left the ground. Obamacare v Republican plan compared Trump country: Don't take our healthcare 'I owe my life to Obamacare' The Senate may very well try to vote on straight-up repeal, as the president has suggested - one with a two-year fuse - but it stands little chance of winning majority support. If and when that fails, it's back to the drawing board for Republicans. The urgent need to do something, anything, to fulfil their years of healthcare promises is still there. The White House is pledging to keep up the pressure. There could even be a move, as some Republicans are now urging, to reach out to Democrats for help crafting a bipartisan solution to fix some of the current system's more glaring shortcomings. This isn't the end of congressional efforts to pass healthcare legislation. But it's likely the end of the repeal-and-replace war as it's been waged for the past six months. The final casualty list won't be tabulated at least until the midterm elections in November 2018, but it's not too early to wonder exactly how high the political death count for Republicans might run. The Senate's Obamacare repeal bill is woefully unpopular and has led to numerous protests All the members of the House of Representatives who gathered on the grounds of the White House to celebrate voting for a bill that was both politically toxic and will now never see the light of day have to be wondering if they stuck their neck out only to see the glint of the guillotine. Others may be left wondering if the grassroots Tea Party faithful who rallied to their sides in opposition to Barack Obama and the Democrats in years past may find better things to do than vote when the next election day rolls around. Political epitaphs aren't written in a day, and Mr Trump and the Republicans still have the opportunity to regroup and recover. They could find solace in a tax reform package or some new, as yet unrevealed infrastructure spending plan. This is a serious setback, however. And time is a commodity in increasingly limited supply.

Why did (almost) everyone call the election wrong (again)?,"This video can not be played Why do pollsters - and the media - keep getting elections so wrong? Ian Katz reports Few species can match the brutality of a teenage child appraising its parent. I was reminded of this the morning after last month's election as I passed my 18-year-old daughter on the stairs. ""I'm never going to believe another word you say about politics,"" she announced matter-of-factly. ""Because you've been wrong about EVERYTHING."" It was hard to argue. The 2015 election, Brexit, Trump, and now Corbyn's sort of moral victoryâ¦ I'd called them all wrong. I was, as they say in American sport, ""Oh for four"". The only comfort was: most of the media and political world were, too. Over the last month, I've been reflecting on why we keep getting surprised,for a Newsnight film. Has the political landscape changed in some profound way we have not yet got our heads around? Or have we simply been through a period of freak political weather? Not impressed... Ian Katz's daughter is sceptical now of pundits and pollsters And, more immediately, how did most of the media, the pollsters and even much of the Left underestimate Labour's vote so badly? In the spirit of group therapy, I thought I'd start with someone who was even wronger than me. Martin Boon has long been one of Britain's most respected pollsters. This time his company, ICM, got it quite spectacularly wrong; their eve-of-election poll gave the Tories a 12-point lead, a full 10 points bigger than the actual result. I found him in contemplative, even penitent, mood. In 2015, ICM got it wrong by overestimating the Labour vote. This time, they tried to address the problem by making sceptical assumptions about how many younger voters (among other groups) would turn out - and ended up massively underestimating Labour's vote. ""We were bamboozled by the turnout which we predicted wouldn't happen in the way it did,"" he said. ""And I have to hold up my hands and say thatâ¦ ""The problem for me is that the techniques which didn't work in 2015 did work in 2017, and indeed the techniques which the likes of me applied in 2017 wouldn't have worked retrospectively in 2015."" The result of the election was a shock to many Election 2017: The result in maps and charts Election results 2017: 20 things you may have missed John Curtice: Six key lessons from a surprise result 'Clearly not a good night for pollsters' Tony Blair: I think Corbyn could be PM With a degree of humility not often encountered in either politics or the media, he said pollsters had to think hard about whether ""classical orthodox polling techniques"" were still worth persevering with. One source of comfort to pollsters and journalists mulling over why they didn't see last month's result coming is the fact that most politicians didn't either. A source told me the Labour Party's internal predictions, minutes before the exit poll was released, were for a Tory majority of around 60 seats. Labour MP Jess Phillips said she and other MPs simply weren't hearing anything on the ground to make them doubt the widely shared belief that they were heading for a drubbing. This video can not be played Tony Blair: ""There's been so many political upsets, it's possible that Jeremy Corbyn could become prime minister"" ""What we potentially missed in classic campaigning and classic polling is the people we're not talking to, and still I'm driving round my constituency thinking, 'Did you vote for me? Did you vote for me?' We just weren't talking to the right people."" One man not willing to don sackcloth and ashes just yet is ITV's political editor Robert Peston, who was more upbeat than many in the media about Jeremy Corbyn's prospects: right up to polling day when, he says, he was persuaded by senior politicians on both sides that his instincts were mistaken. Like many of us, Mr Peston confessed he was still trying to find his bearings in a world where many of the things we thought were true no longer seem to apply. ""The old rules have gone and we've got to try and make sense of how politics works. And the truthful answer is we're all feeling our way a bit."" So what about the man who, perhaps more than anyone, can claim to have divined the rules of modern politics? Even Tony Blair, a man not famous for self-doubt, says the events of the last two years have made him rethink some of his assumptions about politics. Robert Peston: ""The old rules have gone"" ""For most of my political life I've been saying, 'I think this is the right way to go, and what's more it's the only way to win an election.' I have to qualify that now. I have to say, 'No, I think it's possible you end up with Jeremy Corbyn as prime minister.' ""I personally think it's a surer route to power to fight it from the centre but I'm being open with you in saying that I accept now what if you'd asked me a year ago I'd have said is impossible."" Given that there's a fair chance we'll be grappling with another UK election in months rather than years, how can we do better at reading it than we have done on recent votes? A good person to ask seemed to be one of the few commentators who called the 2017 election almost exactly right, Rod Liddle of the Spectator and the Sunday Times. Liddle's prescription: ""Get out of town, get out of London. Unless the polls change the way they are being done ignore them. And don't follow the herd."" Most pollsters and pundits underestimated how well Jeremy Corbyn would do in the election Of course, the BBC and other media organisations did have lots of on the ground reporting from across the country during the election and some of it did suggest that Mr Corbyn was doing better than most pollsters and pundits thought. But there's a tendency to tune out evidence that doesn't fit the prevailing narrative. One person who never doubted that Mr Corbyn would surprise his detractors is Matt Turner, a (just) 22-year-old who, while not doing his finals last month, was helping to edit Evolve Politics, one of a clutch of pro-Corbyn websites which claimed to have their finger closer to the national pulse than traditional media. Although there is never a shortage of seers claiming to be wise after any surprise event, Turner has the betting slip to prove it: he put money on a hung parliament at 10-1 back in April. ""Sites like ours had our ear to the ground and we gave a more accurate reflection of what people were actually feeling. People have accused us of living in a bubble when we've accurately predicted the hung parliament. If anything it's now the Westminster media who are living in that bubble."" The one common thread among all those I talked to was an acknowledgement that social media - simultaneously mobilising, and polarising - has clearly changed the way millions of people experience politics. And we haven't yet worked out how to take the pulse of an election played out in 50 million timelines. Figuring out how to do that may be the most urgent challenge facing all of us whose job it is to read the political runes. For the foreseeable future, though, you'd be best advised to ignore all political predictions. And I, my daughter at least will be pleased to know, won't be making any.

Paramedic has liquid thrown in face,"A Met Police spokesman said the substance was non-corrosive but it is investigating A lone paramedic had a substance thrown on to her face, neck and chest while answering a 999 call. She was on her way to a patient when she was flagged down by three men who appeared to be in distress in Tottenham Hale, north London. The 32-year-old stopped to help but they pulled bandanas over their faces before one threw liquid through her window. She was taken to hospital after the attack on 16 July but later discharged. A Met Police spokesman said the substance was non-corrosive but it is investigating the incident. Since 2010,there have been more than 1,800 reports of attacks involving corrosive fluids in the capital. Last year, it was used in 458 crimes, compared to 261 in 2015, according to Met Police figures. The paramedic, who did not want to be named, was on her way to help a man suffering from chest pains when she was targeted in the early hours. ""It was terrifying. This was so cowardly,"" she said. ""It is my job to help people. I was on my way to help a patient and I stopped because I am caring and I thought they needed my help. ""They have taken away my trust. ""What they've done is horrific in so many ways. It was premeditated and it delayed a patient getting treatment."" She said the attack took a paramedic off the road that night. ""And yet if one my attackers were hurt, I would still treat them because that is the job,"" she added. The substance caused irritation to her face, neck and chest. The man who threw it was wearing latex gloves. London Ambulance Service is reminding its staff of the need to be cautious when flagged down by anyone requesting help or assistance.

Robot 'drowns' in fountain mishap,"The Knightscope K5 robot tumbled into the fountain by accident A security robot in Washington DC suffered a watery demise after falling into a fountain by an office building. The stricken robot, made by Knightscope, was spotted by passers-by whose photos of the aftermath quickly went viral on social media. For some, the incident seemed to sum up the state of 21st Century technology. ""We were promised flying cars, instead we got suicidal robots,""wrote one worker from the building,externalon Twitter. Rescuers soon appeared to retrieve the fallen bot ""Steps are our best defence against the Robopocalypse,""commented Peter Singer,external- author of Wired for War, a book about military robotics.

Electricity concerns preceded Grenfell fire,"Former residents of Grenfell say electricity problems at the tower persisted into the months preceding the fire Dozens of residents of Grenfell Tower suffered electricity power surges so strong their appliances malfunctioned, overheated and emitted smoke a few years before the fire, it has emerged. Documents seen by the BBC reveal how 25 residents claimed compensation from the council following the surges in 2013. Some say electricity problems persisted into the months before June's fire. Police say the blaze, in which at least 80 are thought to have died, started in a fridge freezer on the fourth floor. One fire expert told the BBC the electricity spikes could have been an issue which led to the fire starting in the first place. Neither the council nor the tenant management organisation which looks after the tower have commented. Grenfell council's Â£50m housing deals Tower tragedy caused by 'years of neglect' Building rules review after Grenfell fire London fire: Six questions for the investigation The documents show that 45 of the tower's 129 flats were affected by a particularly powerful electricity surge on 29 May 2013. Eventually, 25 of those residents claimed compensation and received Â£200 each from the Conservative-controlled Kensington and Chelsea Council, a sum that many of them considered derisory. In a letter dated 24 July 2013, the council's housing department stated that ""â¦a series of surges were reported in Grenfell Towerâ¦"" and that the Kensington and Chelsea Tenant Management Organisation, or TMO, that was responsible for managing the block ""â¦has been actively investigating the causeâ¦"". Judith Blakeman, the local Labour councillor and a board member for the TMO, believes the problem was never satisfactorily solved The letter was sent to Judith Blakeman, the local Labour councillor. Cllr Blakeman, who is also a board member for the TMO, said the surge affected many electrical appliances including fridges and computers. She believes the electricity problem was never satisfactorily solved, saying: ""One of the things they tried to suggest was that the smoke that people had seen was actually steam. ""Now, that didn't go down well with residents, because they can tell the difference between smoke and steam."" A shadow over the capital 'Working class aren't being listened to' Grenfell Tower fire began in fridge-freezer Residents' representatives expressed deep concern about electricity at the block. One document indicates that the surges caused some appliances to explode and smoke. In an email to the TMO in November 2013, more than six months after the serious surges, a tenant representative claimed that ""electrical engineers failed to detect any problem"", adding ""â¦how could this be? ""Even the dogs in the street knew by this time that the Grenfell Tower power supply was in a highly volatile and dangerous state."" Sajad Jamalvatan, who moved into Grenfell Tower only in August last year, says he was concerned about the safety of electricity Former residents of Grenfell say electricity problems at the tower even persisted following the refurbishment and into the months preceding the fire. Sajad Jamalvatan, a biomechanical engineering student, moved into a flat on the third floor of Grenfell Tower only in August last year following the completion of the refurbishment works. He said he was concerned about the safety of the electricity in the tower. Mr Jamalvatan said the newly installed electrical meter often made a strange buzzing sound at night and constantly had to be topped up with money. He was also concerned about the state of the wiring at the bottom of the tower, adding: ""I went to the basement once and I saw a huge mess in the basement. So much wiring."" This video can not be played Metropolitan Police footage shows investigators entering the smoke-blackened staircases Grenfell residents belonging to the Grenfell Action Group blogged warnings about the power surges and other problems at the tower at the time in 2013. Joe Delaney, spokesman for the group, told the BBC there were problems with the electricity at the tower in the months leading up to the fire. He said: ""There's been lots of issues with the electrics. There seemed to be a litany of problems."" Geoff Wilkinson, a building inspector and fire expert, said: ""Certainly the issue with electricity spikes could well have been an issue which led to the fire in the first instance. ""If you're getting appliances overheat as a result of that then that could be an initial ignition source but that itself would not have led to the spread."" Police say the Grenfell Tower fire started in a fridge-freezer He added, ""I think it clearly concerns anyone that if you hear that there are 20 appliances in one day, there is something that is clearly wrong."" Both the TMO and Kensington and Chelsea Council said they could not comment, because of the public inquiry and police investigation into the fire. The TMO added: ""We recognise our responsibility to ensure that the investigative process is not hampered or undermined in any way.""

Theatre company ad attacks millennials,"The advert was posted on Arts Council England's ArtsJobs site A theatre company has questioned if millennials ""are taught anything about... the real world"" after being unimpressed by applicants for a job. The Tea House Theatre, in Vauxhall, south London, posted an advert for the Â£15,000-Â£20,000 administration role on Arts Council England's ArtsJobs site. In it, the advert read that ""it shouldn't be this hard"" to find ""a grafter, who can commit"". The theatre has so far not commented and the advert has since been removed. MPs given guide to millennials Millennials 'lose wages race with Gen X' Why the millennial stereotype is wrong Arts Council England said the advert was deleted for breaching terms as it targeted a specific age group. The term ""millennial"" is typically applied to those born between 1980 and 1999, who reached adulthood in the 21st century. Tea House Theatre wonders why ""millennials"" - the generation born between 1980 and 1999 and the largest age group since the baby boomers -  are so turned off a job that ""shouldn't be this hard"" to fill, but perhaps the answer lies in the pay. It wants to offer someone between Â£15,000 and Â£20,000 a year for an administrative job in London. This works out at between Â£288 and Â£384 a week. That's less than the UK median wage for a full-time administration worker (excluding secretaries). Rent is also significantly higher in London than anywhere else in England. According to the latest figures from the Valuation Office Agency, a one-bedroom property in London will cost a renter about Â£1,300 a month. That compares with Â£595 for England as a whole. So far from having not been taught ""anything about existing in the real world, where every penny counts"", it may simply be that potential applicants, many of whom came of age after the 2008 financial crisis, were all too aware of the costs of living and working in the capital. In the post, the firm described itself as a ""receiving house, producing house"" which has ""an outdoor events company putting on festivals on the Vauxhall Pleasure Gardens."" However, the company wrote that it was the third time they had put up the advert in as many months as they ""have not been impressed so far."" ""One old lady used to run the whole of Mountview Academy with an IBM computer, it shouldn't be this hard,"" the advert said. Tea House Theatre was criticised for attacking millenials while serving ""smashed avocado on toast"" Several people took to social media to comment on the advert. Theatre company Creative Electrictweeted,external: ""Dear Tea House Theatre, it's never good to advertise that you're entitled, patronising and abusive.

England 'on track' to stamp out smoking,"The government has set out an ambitious plan to make England, in effect, smoke-free in the next few decades. The newTobacco Control Plan,externalaims to slash smoking rates from 15.5% to 12% of the population by 2022, paving the way to a smoke-free generation. If national smoking rates continue to fall, this generation of non-smokers could be achieved by 2030, says charity Action on Smoking and Health (Ash). Health officials say smoking currently kills 200 people a day in England. Smoking rates in England are at the lowest level since records began. But the Department of Health says there is still much further to go. It has sets out a range of targets: Reducing general smoking rates from the current 15.5% down to 12% or less Cutting the rate of 15-year-olds who regularly smoke from 8% to 3% or less Lowering smoking in pregnancy from 10.7% to 6% or less. Commenting on the proposals, Deborah Arnott, the chief executive of Ash, said: ""The vision of a smoke-free generation it sets out is a welcome step-change in ambition from the last Tobacco Control Plan for England and should be achievable by 2030."" But she warned that the success of the plan - which emphasises local over national action -  was threatened by ""severe government cuts in public health funding"". There is no new money to achieve this plan and no penalties for local areas that fail to meet the targets. And smoking rates remain stubbornly high in some regions, particularly among the lowest earners. Public Health England's chief executive Duncan Selbie said the country was at a ""pivotal point"" where the end was in sight and a smoke-free generation a reality. But he added: ""The final push, reaching the most vulnerable and disadvantaged, will undoubtedly be the hardest."" Meanwhile, Simon Clark, director of the smokers' group Forest, called on ministers to ""stop lecturing"" people. He said: ""The most important stakeholder is the consumer, yet they are routinely ignored by the government. Ministers should stop lecturing smokers and engage with them."" Public health minister, Steve Brine, said: ""Smoking continues to kill hundreds of people a day in England, and we know the harms fall on some of the poorest and most vulnerable people in our society. ""That is why we are targeting prevention and local action to address the variation in smoking rates in our society, educate people about the risks and support them to quit for good."" One of the areas the government's plan focuses on is cutting smoking rates in pregnancy, partly by calling on local areas to appoint smoke-free pregnancy ""champions"". It comes as theSmoking in Pregnancy Challenge Group,external- which includes academic institutions and charities- says pregnant women who find it hard to quit should be encouraged to try e-cigarettes as an alternative. Prof Linda Bauld, chairwoman of the group, told the BBC: ""Smoking in pregnancy is uniquely harmful. It causes 2,000 premature births, 5,000 miscarriages and 300 deaths of babies every year in the UK. ""So if somebody is struggling to stop, let us be open about that, let us talk about all the options. ""If a woman is really struggling and wants to use e-cigarettes, then from what we know to date in the UK, we shouldn't be preventing those women from using them.""

Inflation rate falls on lower fuel prices,"The UK's inflation rate dropped unexpectedly to 2.6% in June, down from 2.9% in May, official figures have shown. It is the first fall in the rate since October 2016 and was largely down to lower petrol and diesel prices. Fuel prices fell for the fourth month in a row in June, according to theOffice for National Statistics,external. Economists say the fall in inflation could ease pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates. The UK inflation rate has risen sharply since the referendum on membership of the European Union last June, partly due to an increase in the cost of imported goods following the fall in the value of the pound. Simon Jack: Has inflation killed off an interest rate rise? ""These numbers are a real surprise, showing the first drop in inflation since autumn 2016,"" said Lucy O'Carroll, chief economist at Aberdeen Asset Management. ""This is going to kill the chances of a rate rise in the short term. We'll learn more about the Bank of England's thinking in a couple of weeks, but we can expect the calls for a  rate rise to reduce to a whimper."" But June's fall in inflation is a blip, according to some economists. ""We have not necessarily passed the peak of inflation,"" said Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC. ""Oil prices are volatile and could bounce back later this year. Meanwhile, the big fall in the value of the pound since last summer is still working its way through the pipeline and has not yet fully fed through into shop prices."" Another measure of inflation, the Retail Prices Index (RPI), edged lower from an annual rate of 3.7% in May to 3.5% in June. RPI is used to calculate the interest rate for student loans, for example. The ONS also reports a version of consumer price inflation that includes housing costs known as CPIH. That rate fell to 2.6% in June from 2.7% in May. Also contributing to June's fall in inflation was a decline in prices for recreational and cultural goods, which includes items such as toys, computer games and sports events. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has described wage growth as 'anaemic' Despite June's fall, inflation is still running ahead of average wage growth, which stands at 2% excluding bonuses. That is eroding the value of people's pay, something the Bank of England has been keeping a close eye on. Last month, the Bank's governor, Mark Carney, said that ""anaemic"" wage growth one of the reasons why he was not supporting a rise in interest rates. While Mr Carney is not keen to raise interest rates, other members of the Monetary Policy Committee think the time has come to make a move. In last month's meetingthree members out of eight voted in favour of a rate rise from the current level of 0.25%. Inflation has been on a steady climb since the end of 2015 and accelerated after the EU referendum result in June last year, as the sharp fall in the value of the pound pushed up the price of everything we import. A bit like a snake that has swallowed something big, that bulge in import costs has taken its time to work through the economic system because producers, wholesalers and retailers order things in advance, so it takes time for higher costs to show up in consumer prices. Inflation could still go up again this year - and many economists forecast it will - but it seems likely that we have been at least close to the peak.

New plastic Â£10 note to be revealed,"The new plastic Â£10 note has been unveiled by Bank of England governor Mark Carney at Winchester Cathedral. The note, which follows the polymer Â£5, will be issued on 14 September and has a portrait of Jane Austen on the 200th anniversary of the author's death. It is also the first Bank of England note to include a tactile feature to help visually impaired people. Meanwhile, a limited supply of a new Â£2 coin honouring Jane Austen has been put into circulation by the Royal Mint. The coin will initially only be available in tills at key locations in the Winchester and Basingstoke areas that have connections with Austen, including Winchester Cathedral and the Jane Austen House Museum. It will be circulated more widely across the UK later this year. The Â£10 note will be made of the same material as the Â£5 note, which means it also contains some traces of animal fat - an issue which caused concern for vegans and some religious groups when it was launched last September. A petition to ban the note attracted more than 100,000 signatures but the new Â£10 will again contain some tallow, which is derived from meat products. The new Â£10 note (top) is smaller than the current one The Jane Austen quote on the note from Pride and Prejudice has also attracted some unfavourable comment. The quotation: ""I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!"" is uttered by a character called Caroline Bingley who in fact has no interest in books and is merely trying to impress Mr Darcy, a potential suitor. But Mr Carney defended the choice. ""It captures much of her [Jane Austen's] spirit, at least in my mind,"" he said. ""It draws out some of the essence of some of her social satire and her insight into people's character. So it works on multiple levels."" A new polymer Â£20 featuring artist JMW Turner is due to be issued by 2020, but there are no plans to replace the current Â£50 note, which was released in 2011. The Bank of England says the new Â£10 notes contain sophisticated security features and are expected to last five years, which is two-and-a-half times longer than the current note. A see-through window featuring the Queen's portrait. Winchester Cathedral shown in gold foil on the front of the note and silver on the back. A quill at the side of the window which changes from purple to orange. A hologram which contains the word ""Ten"" and changes to ""Pounds"" when the note is tilted. A hologram of the coronation crown which appears 3D and multi-coloured when the note is tilted. A book-shaped copper foil patch which contains the letters JA. Micro-lettering beneath the Queen's portrait with tiny letters and numbers that are visible under a microscope. The words ""Bank of England"" printed in intaglio (raised ink) along the top of the note. The tactile feature was developed in conjunction with the Royal National Institute of Blind People (RNIB) and is a series of raised dots in the top left-hand corner of each note. Bank notes are already in tiered sizes, and have bold numerals, raised print and differing colours to help blind and partially sighted people. Launching the note in Winchester Cathedral, Austen's final resting place, Mr Carney paid tribute to the author, saying: ""The new Â£10 note celebrates Jane Austen's work. Austen's novels have a universal appeal and speak as powerfully today as they did when they were first published."" Why Jane Austen is trending 200 years on Victoria Cleland, the Bank's chief cashier, said: ""The new Â£10 note marks the next exciting step in our introduction of cleaner, safer, stronger polymer banknotes, and I am grateful to the cash industry for their work towards a smooth transition."" The design of the note includes the quote ""I declare after all there is no enjoyment like reading!"" from Austen's novel Pride and Prejudice and a portrait of the novelist based on an original sketch drawn by her sister Cassandra. This video can not be played Jane Austen ""would have been gobsmacked"" by the new Â£2 coin and Â£10 note says biographer Meanwhile, the Austen Â£2 coin, designed by Royal Mint graphic designer Dominique Evans, features Austen's silhouette, set in a period frame against a backdrop of Regency wallpaper. Ms Evans said: ""I imagined Jane Austen's framed silhouette as if it were in one of the houses featured in her books, on the wall of a corridor as guests passed by to attend a dance, perhaps in Pride and Prejudice, or on the wall in the home of Emma."" Austen had her first novel Sense and Sensibility published anonymously in 1811 at the age of 35. The Bank of Scotlandunveiled the design of its new plastic Â£10 noteat the end of May. Featuring Scottish novelist and poet Sir Walter Scott alongside The Mound in Edinburgh on the front and the Glenfinnan Viaduct on the back, it also has a picture of a steam locomotive hauling a heritage tourist train. The note is due to come into circulation in the autumn.

Life expectancy rises 'grinding to halt',"Rising rates of life expectancy are grinding to a halt in England after more than 100 years of continuous progress, says a leading health expert. University College London expert Sir Michael Marmot said he was ""deeply concerned"" by the situation, calling it ""historically highly unusual"". He said it was ""entirely possible"" austerity was to blame and said the issue needed looking at urgently. But the government said its policies were not responsible. The Department of Health said ministers were providing the necessary support and funding to ensure life expectancy ""continues to increase"". How long do we really want to live? Limit to human life may be 115 (ish) Life expectancy to break 90 barrier Using Office for National Statistics projections for babies born since 2000, Sir Michael, who has advised both the government and World Health Organization, showed the rate of increase in life expectancy had nearly halved since 2010 in England. He did not look at other parts of the UK. Between 2000 and 2015, life expectancy at birth increased by one year every five years for women and by one year every 3.5 years for men. But this compares to one year every 10 years for women and one for every six for men post-2010. Sir Michael, who is director of the Institute of Health Equity at UCL, said this showed the growth in life expectancy was ""pretty close to having ground to a halt"". He said that was ""historically highly unusual"" given the rising life expectancy seen over the past 100 years. ""I am deeply concerned with the levelling off, I expected it to keep getting better."" He said it was hard to draw firm conclusions about the cause. But he said it was ""entirely possible"" austerity had played a role. He explained social factors such as education, employment and working conditions and poverty all affected life expectancy by influencing lifestyles. And as austerity was placing pressures on these, they may in turn be influencing life expectancy. He also highlighted what he said was ""miserly"" funding settlements for the NHS and social care, which meant the quality of life for older people would have deteriorated and could well affect their life expectancy. This was a particularly pressing issue given the numbers of people with dementia, although that increase in itself may also be playing a role in the levelling off. Sir Michael dismissed the idea that the slowing of life expectancy could be related to humans reaching the outer limit of how long they could live. He said other countries, such as Hong Kong, had longer life expectancy than England and had continued to see consistent rises. And he added it should be a ""matter of urgency"" to work out exactly what was behind the trend. Other research has suggested there is much more scope for life expectancy to rise. Last year scientists in the US concludedthe absolute limit for human life was about 115. Scientists believe there is much more scope for life expectancy rates to rise Alzheimer's Society chief executive Jeremy Hughes said Sir Michael was right to point the finger of blame at austerity. ""Too often we hear the consequences of inadequate, underfunded care - our investigation last year revealed people with dementia left in soiled sheets, becoming ill after eating out of date food, and ending up in costly hospital or care home admissions unnecessarily. ""The government has to act before the care system collapses entirely."" But a Department of Health spokesman said: ""Just last week, the NHSwas rated the number one health servicein the world. ""Life expectancy continues to increase, with cancer survival rates at a record high whilst smoking rates are at an all-time low."" And he said investment was being made to ensure the ageing population was ""well cared for"" with the NHS budget having been increased since 2010 and extra money now being invested in social care. Average life expectancy in England is currently 83 for women and 79.4 for men. The simple answer is to live healthily. That means eating well and exercising regularly. Not smoking and drinking within safe limits is also important. Inactivity increases the risk of an early death, but social factors are important too, says Sir Michael Prevention - in terms of immunisation and screening - plays a key role as does access to good health care when you are sick. People throughout England, and the rest of the UK for that matter, have good access to these through the NHS. And yet there are wide differences in life expectancy. One of the places with the biggest gap in life expectancy - as has been widely reported following the Grenfell Tower fire - is Kensington and Chelsea in London. This is because of so-called social determinants. These cover factors such as housing, education, working conditions and poverty. Experts such as Sir Michael believe these are just as important, if not more, as anything else. And what determines these? Wealth. The richest people in Kensington and Chelsea live 16 years longer than the poorest.

R Kelly denies holding women in 'cult',"R Kelly has been accused of sexual misconduct before but was not found guilty R&B singer R Kelly has denied allegations that he is holding several young women in an ""abusive cult"". The singer's lawyer said he would work ""diligently and forcibly to pursue his accusers and clear his name"". A BuzzFeed report,externalaccuses the singer of brainwashing women, who got closer to him in an effort to boost their musical careers. One of the women said she was ""not being brainwashed"". Kelly denies any wrongdoing. He has faced previous accusations of sexual misconduct, but was never found guilty. The report, which quoted three unnamed sets of parents, said they had not seen or spoken with their daughters for months, and that the women, all of them over the age of consent, had their routines controlled by the singer. That included rules about what they could eat and wear, when to bathe and sleep and how to engage in sexual encounters recorded by him, they said. One of the women, Joycelyn Savage, 21,told the TMZ website,externalshe was not in a cult. In a video posted hours after the allegations emerged, she said: ""I'm in a happy place in my life. I'm not being brainwashed or anything like that."" She added that the issue had ""definitely got out of hand"". Three former members of Kelly's inner circle were also interviewed, saying that six women lived in properties managed by the singer in similar conditions. If they broke the ""rules"", they said, the women could be punished physically and verbally by the singer, according to the report. Some of the parents reported their concerns to the police, but the women said they were not being held against their will. The singer's lawyer, Linda Mensch, said in a statement: ""Robert Kelly is both alarmed and disturbed at the recent revelations attributed to him. Mr Kelly unequivocally denies such allegations."" BuzzFeed has said it is standing by its reporting. In 2008, R Kelly was acquitted of14 charges of making child pornography,externalafter a videotape emerged allegedly showing him having sex with a 14-year-old girl. Kelly is one of the most successful R&B artists of all time, with 40 million records sold worldwide. His best known hits include I Believe I Can Fly and Ignition (Remix).

Reality Check: What happened to Grenfell donations?,"More than 170 tonnes of physical donations were collected following the fire at Grenfell Tower Survivors and relatives of those who died in the fire at Grenfell Tower last month have so far received only a small fraction of the cash and items donated by members of public. The cardboard boxes bounced from person to person. Many had seen their neighbours suffer terribly. But the volunteers who formed the human chain stretching down the street seemed buoyed by the sheer scale of the response. It was two days after the Grenfell Tower fire and mountains of donations sat in car parks, basketball courts and by the side of the road. The now infamous and black high-rise block loomed nearby. From clothes to baby milk, bedding to bottled water. The huge quantity of donations was the enduring positive image in the wake of a tragedy which shook the country in so many ways. Messages from the tower A visual guide to what happened at Grenfell Tower In total, more than 170 tonnes of donated items are estimated to have been collected. Some of the donations are now miles away in a warehouse in Cheshire. It is akin to the British Red Cross' northern sorting office for the Grenfell appeal. So far 100 giant cardboard containers, full of donations, have been moved there. Thousands of clothes are being sorted in a British Red Cross warehouse in Cheshire Damaged or stained items are sorted into black sacks for recycling. Good quality clothes go into green sacks for sale in some 200 Red Cross shops across the country. Diana Goss, from the British Red Cross says Grenfell, as a logistical challenge for aid agencies, is ""really off the scale."" So far the charity has managed to sort through around half of everything donated. Less than 6% (10 tonnes) has been offered to the residents who have lost their homes. An estimated 174 tonnes of items were donated and are being handled by the British Red Cross 10 tonnes have or will soon be made available to the former residents of Grenfell Tower 62 tonnes are being sold in British Red Cross shops (with the proceeds going to its Grenfell fund) 15 tonnes are being sold to textile recycling companies (with the proceeds going to Grenfell victims) 87 tonnes - half of the total donated - are yet to be sorted Source: British Red Cross The sheer volume of items donated means that only brand new items are being returned to London and given direct to residents. Gwynn, a British Red Cross volunteer, said he was moved to help after ""seeing how awful it was on the news."" The majority of donated items are being sold in shops with the proceeds being ring-fenced for the Grenfell Tower fund. So when people donate huge quantities of second-hand belongings all at once, it presents charities with a logistical, if welcome, headache. Hard cash has much less baggage. However what the Grenfell appeal has shown is that it takes time for the money to reach the people it's intended for. The government pledged Â£5,500 in emergency funds for every household who lost their home. But as much as Â£20m has been donated by private individuals and businesses to charities and appeals. Of those donations less than Â£800,000 has been given out so far. Â£5.5m London Community Foundation/Evening Standard Dispossessed Fund Â£5.1m K&C Foundation Â£4.7m British Red Cross Â£4m More than 700 individual appeals on the websites like JustGiving and GoFundMe Â£500,000 Four Muslim charities Â£214,280 Grenfell Muslim Response Unit (cash) Â£220,000 London Community Foundation/Evening Standard Dispossessed Fund (Â£120,000 cash, Â£100,000 to local organisations) Â£180,000 K&C Foundation (Â£120,000 to local organisations, Â£60,000 cash). A further Â£120,000 in cash grants is being processed. Â£158,000 by the London Emergency Trust (cash to bereaved and injured) The big fundraisers, including the Red Cross, have already passed Â£4.8m to the London Emergency Trust. Its job now is to distribute the money. The Trust gives grants to bereaved family members and those who were injured. One of its trustees is Thelma Stober. She was injured in one of the suicide bomb attacks in London on 7 July 2005. Thelma says the financial support she received from the trust in the wake of that attack helped pay for crucial physiotherapy. She says it is almost inevitable that money from the Grenfell appeal will take time to reach the victims. ""You're in a state of confusion"", she says. ""A lot will be suffering from post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD)."" And therefore Thelma believes it is crucial that people know where to go to get help in a simple and fast way. In the case of Grenfell, 16 people have so far received financial support from the trust totalling Â£158,000, a small fraction of the total. It is currently considering dozens of applications and expects more payments will follow soon. Police believe at least 80 people died in the fire which started in the early hours of 14 June. They say 255 people are thought to have survived. In the immediate vicinity of Grenfell Tower people are sceptical about whether all of the money donated will make it through to those most in need. For Samia Badani, who chairs a residents group for some of the people living next door, there is a sense that the public's generosity ""is being betrayed."" ""They gave money to help those directly affected and we're not too clear that it is happening"", she tells us. But the Chief Executive of the British Red Cross, Mike Adamson, insists his organisation, in conjunction with others, is ""working round the clock"" to process applications and get the support, financial or otherwise, to those in need. ""What we've learnt from the 7/7 bombings, or Manchester is that it takes longer than you might think for people to come forward and to seek their funding."" He also believes the process will be delayed because, in the case of those affected by the fire, some ""are wary of officialdom"" and there are issues surrounding some people's immigration status. People who think they may be eligible to claim for relief payments are advised to call the British Red Cross helpline on 0800 458 9472. Physical supplies and other support are available at the Westway Sports Centre.

Shot woman's fiance wants answers,"This video can not be played ""Justine should be here. This shouldn't have happened"" The ""heartbroken"" American fiancÃ© of an Australian shot dead by a US police officer has said they have received almost no information from officials. Don Damond said his wife-to-be, Justine Damond, was gunned down after calling police to report a possible sexual assault in their quiet neighbourhood. He said they were ""desperate"" to find out how Saturday's shooting in Minneapolis, Minnesota, happened. The officers' body cameras were not turned on at the time. The shooting happened in a relatively affluent area, where violent crime is rare. Don Damond said his fiancÃ©e, Justine, ""was so kind and so darn funny"" Mr Damond told a news conference outside his home on Monday evening: ""Our hearts are broken and we are utterly devastated by the loss of Justine.

'May urged to sack her 'donkey' ministers',"The Guardian says the Â£1.3bn committed to schools in England was intended to head off a revolt from Tory MPs who think the issue of school funding cost the party its majority. The paper says the announcement was designed to ""placate"" schools and teachers,externalbefore their summer holiday but has left many MPs - including Conservatives - concerned about unfairness. In his parliamentary sketch in theDaily Telegraph,external, Michael Deacon asks what on earth the Department for Education had been doing that it could now save Â£1.3bn through ""efficiencies"". ""A gold plated departmental water cooler?"" he wonders, or ""printers with ink made from unicorns' blood?"". The paper's editorial says a revised funding formula for schools was inevitable,externalgiven the political pressures but that success does not come through money alone and rigorous checks on spending are needed. TheSun,externalsays it is right that schools get the money they need but without blowing billions which the country does not have. The Times reports on ""raised eyebrows"" in Brussels,externalthat Brexit Secretary David Davis took part in less than an hour of talks with the EU. The Guardian says his swift departure prompted suggestions,externalthat the government's parliamentary weakness was impeding the talks, adding that EU officials have feared since the election that the lack of a majority in the Commons could hinder Brexit negotiations. British officials insisted Mr Davis had always intended to leave after a meet-and-greet with his opposite number Michel Barnier. With all these issues, questions of government in-fighting lurk close behind. The Daily Mirror says Tory squabbles have ""exploded into all-out war"",externalin which the country will be the loser. The Times warns government ministers that ""careless talk"" and ""recklessness"",externalcould open the way for Jeremy Corbyn. It says Philip Hammond has been strengthened by the election result, with his focus on a Brexit that protects the economy, and says cabinet colleagues should listen to him instead of seeing ""a minor irritant in the path of the Brexit juggernaut"". Concern about general election fraud isuppermost in the mind of the Daily Mail,external. It leads with an investigation into what the Electoral Commission called ""troubling"" evidence that some students had voted twice in the election because they could easily register at their home address and their term-time address. The paper's editorial warns of ""the growing stench of fraud"" and says this ""glaring loop-hole"" in election law should be closed. Prince George is featured on many of the front pages in what theTimes calls a ""stubborn mood"" during his visit to Poland,external.

Sexist adverts to come under scrutiny,"The advert for Aptamil baby formula showed girls wanting to be ballerinas Advertisements that show men failing at simple household tasks and women left to clean up are set to be banned by the UK advertising watchdog. The Advertising Standards Authority will crack down on ads that feature stereotypical gender roles. Ads that mock people for not conforming to gender types or reinforce gender roles had ""costs for individuals, the economy and society"", the ASA said. As a result new rules will be drawn up that will take effect next year. The ASA said it had decided to conduct a review following the public's reaction to the ""beach body ready"" advertising campaign in 2015. It prompted a wave of complaints for showing a bikini-clad model in an advertisement for a slimming product, which critics said was socially irresponsible. In the past the ASA has banned ads on grounds of objectification, inappropriate sexualisation, and for suggesting it is desirable for young women to be unhealthily thin. But in several instances the regulator had received complaints about ads that featured sexist stereotypes or mocked people who didn't follow traditional roles, which it had not investigated or ruled against, because they were not in breach of the current guidelines. Which adverts drew complaints over sexism? 'Over-sexualised' Femfresh shaving advert banned Rimmel ad featuring Cara Delevingne 'misled viewers' Selfridges ad of 'thin' model cleared by watchdog One example was an advert for Aptamil baby milk formula that showed girls growing up to be ballerinas and boys becoming engineers. Complaints had also been made about adverts for clothing retailer Gap that showed a boy becoming an academic, and a girl becoming a ""social butterfly"". Protein World's 2015 advert sparked a huge backlash An advertisement for KFC featured one man teasing another, who said he suffered from anxiety, over his lack of masculinity. The review suggested that new standards should consider whether the stereotypes shown would ""reinforce assumptions that adversely limit how people see themselves and how others see them."" ""Portrayals which reinforce outdated and stereotypical views on gender roles in society can play their part in driving unfair outcomes for people,"" said Guy Parker, chief executive of the ASA. ""While advertising is only one of many factors that contribute to unequal gender outcomes, tougher advertising standards can play an important role in tackling inequalities and improving outcomes for individuals, the economy and society as a whole."" Not all stereotypes would be barred, however. The ASA suggested showing a woman cleaning or a man doing DIY tasks was acceptable. However it would be unacceptable if a family was shown making a mess and the woman was left with the sole responsibility to clean it up, or a man was shown ""trying and failing to undertake simple parental or household tasks"". The ASA also said ads suggesting specific activities were suitable only for boys or girls were problematic. Which adverts drew complaints over sexism?

Inflation unexpectedly slows to 2.6%,"The UK's inflation rate dropped unexpectedly to 2.6% in June, down from 2.9% in May, official figures have shown. It is the first fall in the rate since October 2016 and was largely down to lower petrol and diesel prices. Fuel prices fell for the fourth month in a row in June, according to theOffice for National Statistics,external. Economists say the fall in inflation could ease pressure on the Bank of England to raise interest rates. The UK inflation rate has risen sharply since the referendum on membership of the European Union last June, partly due to an increase in the cost of imported goods following the fall in the value of the pound. Simon Jack: Has inflation killed off an interest rate rise? ""These numbers are a real surprise, showing the first drop in inflation since autumn 2016,"" said Lucy O'Carroll, chief economist at Aberdeen Asset Management. ""This is going to kill the chances of a rate rise in the short term. We'll learn more about the Bank of England's thinking in a couple of weeks, but we can expect the calls for a  rate rise to reduce to a whimper."" But June's fall in inflation is a blip, according to some economists. ""We have not necessarily passed the peak of inflation,"" said Andrew Sentance, senior economic adviser at PwC. ""Oil prices are volatile and could bounce back later this year. Meanwhile, the big fall in the value of the pound since last summer is still working its way through the pipeline and has not yet fully fed through into shop prices."" Another measure of inflation, the Retail Prices Index (RPI), edged lower from an annual rate of 3.7% in May to 3.5% in June. RPI is used to calculate the interest rate for student loans, for example. The ONS also reports a version of consumer price inflation that includes housing costs known as CPIH. That rate fell to 2.6% in June from 2.7% in May. Also contributing to June's fall in inflation was a decline in prices for recreational and cultural goods, which includes items such as toys, computer games and sports events. Bank of England governor Mark Carney has described wage growth as 'anaemic' Despite June's fall, inflation is still running ahead of average wage growth, which stands at 2% excluding bonuses. That is eroding the value of people's pay, something the Bank of England has been keeping a close eye on. Last month, the Bank's governor, Mark Carney, said that ""anaemic"" wage growth one of the reasons why he was not supporting a rise in interest rates. While Mr Carney is not keen to raise interest rates, other members of the Monetary Policy Committee think the time has come to make a move. In last month's meetingthree members out of eight voted in favour of a rate rise from the current level of 0.25%. Inflation has been on a steady climb since the end of 2015 and accelerated after the EU referendum result in June last year, as the sharp fall in the value of the pound pushed up the price of everything we import. A bit like a snake that has swallowed something big, that bulge in import costs has taken its time to work through the economic system because producers, wholesalers and retailers order things in advance, so it takes time for higher costs to show up in consumer prices. Inflation could still go up again this year - and many economists forecast it will - but it seems likely that we have been at least close to the peak.

Rises in life expectancy 'levelling off',"Rising rates of life expectancy are grinding to a halt in England after more than 100 years of continuous progress, says a leading health expert. University College London expert Sir Michael Marmot said he was ""deeply concerned"" by the situation, calling it ""historically highly unusual"". He said it was ""entirely possible"" austerity was to blame and said the issue needed looking at urgently. But the government said its policies were not responsible. The Department of Health said ministers were providing the necessary support and funding to ensure life expectancy ""continues to increase"". How long do we really want to live? Limit to human life may be 115 (ish) Life expectancy to break 90 barrier Using Office for National Statistics projections for babies born since 2000, Sir Michael, who has advised both the government and World Health Organization, showed the rate of increase in life expectancy had nearly halved since 2010 in England. He did not look at other parts of the UK. Between 2000 and 2015, life expectancy at birth increased by one year every five years for women and by one year every 3.5 years for men. But this compares to one year every 10 years for women and one for every six for men post-2010. Sir Michael, who is director of the Institute of Health Equity at UCL, said this showed the growth in life expectancy was ""pretty close to having ground to a halt"". He said that was ""historically highly unusual"" given the rising life expectancy seen over the past 100 years. ""I am deeply concerned with the levelling off, I expected it to keep getting better."" He said it was hard to draw firm conclusions about the cause. But he said it was ""entirely possible"" austerity had played a role. He explained social factors such as education, employment and working conditions and poverty all affected life expectancy by influencing lifestyles. And as austerity was placing pressures on these, they may in turn be influencing life expectancy. He also highlighted what he said was ""miserly"" funding settlements for the NHS and social care, which meant the quality of life for older people would have deteriorated and could well affect their life expectancy. This was a particularly pressing issue given the numbers of people with dementia, although that increase in itself may also be playing a role in the levelling off. Sir Michael dismissed the idea that the slowing of life expectancy could be related to humans reaching the outer limit of how long they could live. He said other countries, such as Hong Kong, had longer life expectancy than England and had continued to see consistent rises. And he added it should be a ""matter of urgency"" to work out exactly what was behind the trend. Other research has suggested there is much more scope for life expectancy to rise. Last year scientists in the US concludedthe absolute limit for human life was about 115. Scientists believe there is much more scope for life expectancy rates to rise Alzheimer's Society chief executive Jeremy Hughes said Sir Michael was right to point the finger of blame at austerity. ""Too often we hear the consequences of inadequate, underfunded care - our investigation last year revealed people with dementia left in soiled sheets, becoming ill after eating out of date food, and ending up in costly hospital or care home admissions unnecessarily. ""The government has to act before the care system collapses entirely."" But a Department of Health spokesman said: ""Just last week, the NHSwas rated the number one health servicein the world. ""Life expectancy continues to increase, with cancer survival rates at a record high whilst smoking rates are at an all-time low."" And he said investment was being made to ensure the ageing population was ""well cared for"" with the NHS budget having been increased since 2010 and extra money now being invested in social care. Average life expectancy in England is currently 83 for women and 79.4 for men. The simple answer is to live healthily. That means eating well and exercising regularly. Not smoking and drinking within safe limits is also important. Inactivity increases the risk of an early death, but social factors are important too, says Sir Michael Prevention - in terms of immunisation and screening - plays a key role as does access to good health care when you are sick. People throughout England, and the rest of the UK for that matter, have good access to these through the NHS. And yet there are wide differences in life expectancy. One of the places with the biggest gap in life expectancy - as has been widely reported following the Grenfell Tower fire - is Kensington and Chelsea in London. This is because of so-called social determinants. These cover factors such as housing, education, working conditions and poverty. Experts such as Sir Michael believe these are just as important, if not more, as anything else. And what determines these? Wealth. The richest people in Kensington and Chelsea live 16 years longer than the poorest.

William hails Poland's 'bravery',"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have visited a former concentration camp as they continue their tour of Poland. They described their visit to Stutthof as ""shattering"", saying the site is a ""terrible reminder of the cost of war"". The royal couple met five Holocaust survivors at the camp near Gdansk, where 65,000 people were killed by the Nazis in World War Two. The five-day tour of Poland and Germany will see the Cambridges also visit Berlin and Heidelberg. Prince George, three, and Princess Charlotte, two, have accompanied their parents on the trip. The Royal couple met former prisoners of the concentration camp, Manfred Goldberg and Zigi Shipper During their visit to Stutthof, William and Catherine met British survivors Manfred Goldberg and Zigi Shipper, both 87. As a teenager, Mr Goldberg spent more than eight months as a slave worker in Stutthof. There he met Mr Shipper, who had previously been at Auschwitz. Days before the war ended, the camp was abandoned and prisoners were sent on a death march to the German town of Neustadt.  The pair - both 15 at the time - were liberated at Neustadt on 3 May 1945. They later moved to the UK, where they remained friends. Mr Goldberg said he was ""extremely nervous"" about returning to the camp, adding: ""I agonised before I agreed to come here, because I felt I'd put it all behind me. ""In 1946 when I was a youngster I was admitted to England, I didn't dream I would ever have the privilege of shaking the hand of a future King of this country."" Catherine signed a message in the visitors' book A message left in the visitors' book, which both the duke and duchess signed, said: ""We were intensely moved by our visit to Stutthof, which has been the scene of so much terrible pain, suffering and death. ""All of us have an overwhelming responsibility to make sure that we learn the lessons and that the horror of what happened is never forgotten and never repeated."" The royal couple then met Poland's first democratically-elected president, Lech Walesa, who won the Nobel Peace Prize in 1983 for leading Solidarity - the party that helped bring to an end communism in Poland. Prince William and Catherine had a tour of the European Solidarity Centre, which represents the movement Mr Walesa championed, before laying roses at the Monument to the Fallen Shipyard Workers of 1970. The memorial - made up of three 42m steel crosses - was unveiled in 1980, to commemorate the 44 people who died during anti-communist riots.

Republican healthcare efforts collapse,"This video can not be played President Trump won big in Kentucky last year but the state also depends heavily on Obamacare Republican efforts to find a replacement for President Obama's healthcare system have collapsed. Two Republican senators said they opposed their party's proposed alternative, making it impossible for the bill to pass in its current form. The party has been divided on the issue, with moderates concerned about the effects on the most vulnerable. President Trump has now called for repeal of Obamacare, so Republicans can start ""from a clean slate"". That task falls to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell. ""Regretfully, it is now apparent that the effort to repeal and immediately replace the failure of Obamacare will not be successful,"" Mr McConnell said. President Trump had made repealing and replacing Obamacare, under which more than 20 million people gained healthcare coverage, a key campaign pledge. Republicans view the 2010 legislation as an overreach of the federal government and say patients have less choice and higher premiums. The party's proposed alternative had kept key Obamacare taxes on the wealthy, while imposing sharp cuts to healthcare for the poor and allowing insurers to offer less coverage. Why is Obamacare so controversial? Obamacare v Republican plan compared Two Republican senators, Mike Lee and Jerry Moran, said the new legislation did not go far enough in repealing Obamacare. Mr Moransaid,external""we should not put our stamp of approval on bad policy"" whilefor Mr Lee,,external""in addition to not repealing all of the Obamacare taxes [the bill] doesn't go far enough in lowering premiums for middle class families; nor does it create enough free space from the most costly Obamacare regulations"". This video can not be played Healthcare battle in rural America Two senators - Rand Paul and Susan Collins - had already opposed the bill. Mr Paul said the bill kept too much of the ""ObamaCare taxes"", while Ms Collins expressed concerns about cuts to Medicaid. With the two new opponents, Republicans - who hold 52 seats - no longer have enough votes to pass the bill in the 100-member Senate. 'I owe my life to Obamacare' Moderate Republicans had also said the bill would have harmed some of their vulnerable constituents. The non-partisan Congressional Budgetary Office (CBO) found the bill would have stripped 22 million Americans of health insurance over the next decade. On top of that, polls had shown Obamacare remained popular among Americans - a survey by the Washington Post and ABC News on Monday found more than twice as many people preferred Mr Obama's programme to the proposed alternative. By Anthony Zurcher, BBC North America reporter In the end the death blow to the latest iteration of Obamacare repeal came from the right flank. Mr McConnell was always going to have to walk a fine line in his effort to keep both moderates and hard-core conservatives in party on board with his healthcare reform proposal. After his first draft failed to garner sufficient support, he came out with a new version that moved farther to the right in key areas while throwing money to keep the moderates satiated. That strategy worked in the House, where Freedom Caucus arch-conservatives and just enough moderates came around to rescue the legislation from death's doorstep. This time the entire rickety structure came tumbling down. The Senate may very well try to vote on straight-up repeal, as the president has suggested - one with a two-year fuse - but it faces long odds in winning a majority support. If and when that fails, it's back to the drawing board for Republicans. This isn't the end of congressional efforts to pass healthcare legislation. But it's likely the end of the repeal-and-replace war as it's been waged for the past six months. Read Anthony's analysis in full Mr Trumpurged,externalRepublicans to repeal the ""failing Obamacare now and work on a new healthcare plan that will start from a clean slate"". Mr McConnellsaid,externalhe would try to pass a repeal of Obamacare with a two-year delay implementation that would provide a ""stable transition period"" to a new legislation. Correspondents, however, say that this plan has little chance of passing as, under the interim period, millions would be left without healthcare.

Trump must share Mar-a-Lago visitor log,"Mr Trump has hosted several high-profile guests in Mar-a-Lago A US court has ordered that President Donald Trump release records of visitors to his Mar-a-Lago resort in southern Florida. Mr Trump has been to the property seven times this year, including when he hosted foreign leaders. But it is unclear who else he had as guests. The move is part of a legal challenge brought by a non-profit watchdog group. Meanwhile, the outgoing head of the government ethics agency says the US has been made a virtual laughing stock. Walter Shaubtold the New York Times,externalthat the Trump administration has ignored long-established guidelines, and that the flouting of ethics rules at home makes it hard for the US to tackle corruption overseas. The White House has dismissed the criticism, saying that Mr Shaub was promoting himself and had failed to do his job properly. Mar-a-Lago: Inside Trump's Palm Beach retreat Are Mar-a-Lago photos a security risk? Among the visitors that Mr Trump has hosted at his resort - which he calls the ""Winter White House"" - are Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and Chinese President Xi Jinping. The legal case for details of the visitors was launched by Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (Crew), the National Security Archive (NSA) and the Knight First Amendment Institute at Columbia University. Mr Trump and Mr Abe played golf in the Florida resort in February The records must be released by 8 September, a US District Court for the Southern District of New York judge decided. It is not clear what information will be revealed. The groups had also filed lawsuits for visitor records at the White House and Trump Tower in New York,a statement said.,external The Department of Homeland Security, which oversees the Secret Service, said it had no records of visitors at Trump Tower, while the lawsuit was still ongoing for the White House.

""We are glad that as a result of this case, this information will become public for meetings at his personal residences - but it needs to be public for meetings at the White House as well.""

"Stop 'backbiting', May tells Tories","The cabinet has been posing for an official photo Theresa May would have the backing of Tory MPs if she sacked disloyal ministers for plotting and briefing, a senior backbencher says. Charles Walker, vice-chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, told ministers to ""stop chattering away"". Earlier the prime minister told her cabinet to show ""strength and unity"" as she attempted to stem recent leaks. And Defence Secretary Sir Michael Fallon called for the military virtues of ""loyalty, cohesion and discipline"". Speaking at an event organised by the Policy Exchange think tank on Tuesday evening, Sir Michael urged the cabinet to ""concentrate their fire"" on Jeremy Corbyn, whom he described as a ""dangerous enemy in reach of Downing Street"". At the same time, he said his party needed to make traditional Conservative arguments for ""lower taxation, for honest public financing, for wider opportunity, enterprise and ownership"". Cabinet: Laura Kuenssberg's end of term report Theresa May's cabinet: Who's who? Mrs May's attempt to instil discipline follows a sustained outbreak of cabinet leaks and leadership gossip. Number 10 said press briefings were a case of colleagues not taking their responsibilities seriously. Speaking on BBC Radio 4's The World at One, Mr Walker said that aside from a few ""outliers"", the party was united behind Mrs May - adding that those plotting were ""not doing themselves any favours at all"". The defence secretary has issued a warning to his colleagues ""I do not care about people's personal ambitions,"" he said. ""If the prime minister has to start removing secretaries of state because they are not focusing on their job, they are focusing on their own personal ambitions, so be it. ""And she will have the support of the 1922 Committee."" According to her spokesman, the PM told cabinet at its regular Tuesday meeting: ""There's a need to show strength and unity as a country and that starts around the cabinet table."" Tuesday's cabinet meeting was the last before the summer recess Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson was among those at Downing Street Trade Secretary Liam Fox, seen arriving with Environment Secretary Michael Gove, has said he ""deplores"" leaks Commons Leader Andrea Leadsom and Communities Secretary Sajid Javid arrive at cabinet On Monday she told Tory MPs to end the ""backbiting"" over disagreements within the party. At a summer reception for backbench Tory MPs on the House of Commons terrace on Monday, Mrs May told the party ""no backbiting, no carping"". The choice, she said, is ""me or Jeremy Corbyn... and nobody wants that"". Go away over the summer for a ""proper break"", she told MPs, and ""come back ready for serious business"". Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Home Secretary Amber Rudd said media reports of splits and negative briefings did not reflect her experience in cabinet. She said Mrs May was ""absolutely right"" to tell ministers that ""what is said in the cabinet should stay in the cabinet"". The PM's plea to her party for unity comes after she lost her Commons majority when her snap general election gamble backfired. Hostile briefings in the press over the weekend appeared to show a growing rift in the cabinet. On Sunday,Chancellor Philip Hammond suggested colleagues opposed to his approach to Brexithad been briefing against him, following press reports of his cabinet remarks on public sector pay.

Car insurance premiums in record rise,"Motorists are being saddled with the fastest year-on-year rise in insurance premiums since records began five years ago, the industry has warned. Average car insurance premiums have gone up by 11% in the past year, according to the Association of British Insurers (ABI). The typical bill for an annual policy is now Â£484, it said. Earlier this month,the ABI saidcar insurance premiums had already hit a record high in 2016. The news will put further pressure on the government to change its decision to reduce the so-called discount rate in March this year. The effect of that was to increase pay-outs to accident victims, but also to raise premiums. The ABI says the change in the discount rate is the main reason behind the rise, but also blames the latest increase in insurance premium tax which went up from 10% to 12% on 1 June. But personal injury lawyers have hit back - saying the insurance industry has been quietly reaping profits, while failing to pay proper compensation to those seriously injured in accidents. The ABI is calling on the government to introduce a new system for calculating compensation payments. The Ministry of Justice has already consulted on a replacement system, but has not yet announced its decision. ""This dramatic increase drives home how important it is the government press ahead with a new framework for the discount rate and call a stop to further hikes in insurance premium tax,"" said Huw Evans, director general of the ABI. ""Most younger and older drivers are likely to face increases even higher than this, hurting people who can least afford it,"" he said. Car insurance set to soar after compensation announcement But personal injury lawyers have accused the industry of under-paying accident victims before the rules were changed. ""During this time insurers quietly reaped the financial benefits of not having to pay what they owe to people with life-long, life-changing injuries,"" said Brett Dixon, president of the Association of Personal Injury Lawyers. ""Yet the insurance industry has been vociferous in blaming the correction for rising motor premiums. It is scandalous that the blame for the mismanagement of the discount rate is being put at the door of seriously injured people."" Think of the discount rate as a rebate for insurance companies who pay out lump sums to accident victims. In theory those awarded such sums can earn extra money by investing the money they are given, so insurance firms need to pay out slightly less to make up for that. Up until March this year the awards were reduced - or discounted - by 2.5%, the amount that victims could earn in interest on government bonds. But such interest rates - or bond yields - have fallen. In fact once inflation is taken into account, they are now negative - meaning accident victims will actually be losing money in real terms over the long term. That is why the government reduced the discount rate to -0.75% in March. However this means that insurance companies are currently paying a premium to accident victims, rather than getting a rebate on the sums they pay out. The government's decision to cut the discount rate will also be criticised in the House of Lords on Tuesday. Lord Hodgson of Astley Abbotts has tabled what is called a ""motion of regret"" - expressing concern that the government did not commission an impact assessment before ordering the changes.

Russia and US bid to end diplomatic row,"US officials say the Maryland complex doubles as a spying outpost Russia has been pressing demands that the US give it access to two diplomatic compounds seized in the US last year. After high-level talks between both sides, one Russian official involved said the row had ""almost"" been resolved. Russia has been angered by the move, with Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov calling it ""daylight robbery"". In December the US expelled 35 Russian diplomats and shut the compounds over suspicions of meddling in US elections. The talks saw US Undersecretary of State Thomas Shannon host Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov in Washington on Monday. Mr Ryabkov sounded upbeat after three hours of talks with the American diplomat. This video can not be played What does body language tell us about the Trump-Putin G20 meeting? He was asked by reporters if the spat over the diplomatic compounds had been settled, and he replied: ""Almost, almost."" US officials did not comment and there has been no official press briefing. The meeting was meant to have been held in June in St Petersburg, but was cancelled after the US government added 38 individuals and organisations to its list of sanctions over Russian activity in Ukraine. Before the talks Russia made clear it was demanding restored access to the facilities. ""We consider it absolutely unacceptable to place conditions on the return of diplomatic property, we consider that it must be returned without any conditions and talking,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said. Mr Lavrov said that this was not the way decent and well-brought-up people behaved. ""How can you seize property which is protected by a bilateral, inter-governmental, ratified document and, to return it, act according to the principle 'what is mine is mine, and what is yours we'll share'?"" he said during a visit to Belarus. Russia: The 'cloud' over the White House Last week Russia said it was considering ""specific measures"" in retaliation, including the expulsion of 30 US diplomats and seizure of US state property. Ex-President Barack Obamaacted against Russiaafter US intelligence sources accused Russian state agents of hacking into Democratic Party computers to undermine Hillary Clinton's presidential campaign. The Long Island property is surrounded by trees The US seized a Russian diplomatic property on Maryland's Eastern Shore - a sprawling 45-acre (18.2-hectare) retreat. The facility, acquired during the Cold War, was used by Russian diplomats for recreation, such as tennis and swimming. But it also had sophisticated communications, and US officials said it doubled as a spying outpost The other diplomatic property is a New York mansion at Glen Cove, Long Island. It has 49 rooms and is similarly surrounded by woods. Like the Maryland mansion, its location is ideal for eavesdropping on US communications, US officials say Luxury Russia resorts in US crosshairs President Donald Trump's team is under investigation over alleged Russian collusion during last year's presidential campaign. The Kremlin has denied interfering in the election. The Obama sanctions came on top of existing Western sanctions imposed because of Russia's role in the Ukraine conflict. At the time Mr Putin refrained from tit-for-tat retaliation - unlike in previous diplomatic spats. Mr Trump had been elected to succeed President Obama just weeks before. Russia says President Trump presented ""no plan to resolve the crisis"" when the issue was raised at the G20 meeting in Hamburg on 7 July. Russia would retaliate if no compromise was reached at the meeting between Mr Ryabkov and Mr Shannon, the Russian newspaper Izvestia reported. Barbara Plett Usher, BBC News, Washington Russian officials welcomed the tone of the recent meeting between the two presidents. But the political climate in Washington has only grown more toxic, with the ongoing inquiries into allegations of Russian meddling in the presidential election, and possible collusion with the Trump campaign. That makes any concessions to Moscow controversial. Russia's threat to expel some American diplomats if it does not get its property back would further complicate the strained relationship.
