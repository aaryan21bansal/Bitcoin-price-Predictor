What could happen to food prices after Brexit?,"As 29 March approaches with no Brexit deal yet agreed on by Parliament, questions are circulating around how leaving without a deal will affect people's daily lives, including the cost of food. At the moment, the UK imports about 30% of its food from the EU and another 10% from the rest of the world. If there's no deal, the question of what will happen to food crossing the border will have to be faced immediately. IfTheresa May's plangoes through, there will be a 21-month transition period during which nothing will change while the UK and the EU try to work out a future trade agreement. There are lots of things that determine food prices, including the weather. But there are three main things that might affect UK food prices as a direct result of Brexit: The taxes on imported goods, known as tariffs Changes to the value of the pound Things that might slow down goods crossing borders, like extra checks A tariff is the tax that businesses pay on goods imported from other countries. Different rates of tax apply to different products. But each country has to charge the same rates on the same products to every other country unless they have a trade deal. As a member of the European Union, at the moment the UK doesn't pay tariffs on goods - including food products - coming in from other EU countries. Let's say a supermarket wants to import beef from Ireland. Currently it wouldn't have to pay a tax on this but if after Brexit beef started to be taxed at 40%, which is the tariff the EU places on beef coming in from the rest of the world, that's a 40% extra cost to the importer. The UK Trade Policy Observatory at the University of Sussex calculated thatan average tariff of 44.6% on dairy could translate to a price rise of 8.1%,external. Meat could rise in price by 5.8%, oils and fats by 7.8% and vegetables by 4% on average. Businesses want to charge their customers competitive prices, so they may well absorb some of the costs themselves. But past a certain point, they may well have to pass on that extra cost to make a profit - and that could translate to more expensive food in the shops. The UK could choose to lower tariffs - or scrap them altogether - and that could, in theory, lead to lower prices for consumers. The University of Sussex researchers also assessed the impact of zero tariffs on food imports and said this may only reduce food prices by an average of 1%. That's because the goods which are currently subject to the highest rates of tariffs are food items mainly produced in the UK or imported from Europe without any tariffs, like meat and dairy. UK farmers promised 'no deal' tariff protection No-deal Brexit 'bad news' for Welsh food sector No-deal Brexit impact assessment published And products like tea which the UK mostly imports from outside the EU already attract low tariffs - for tea it's 0.86% - so getting rid of those wouldn't contribute as much to falls in food prices. Businesses could choose to import more products like meat and dairy from outside the EU if that became more competitive. The idea of lowering tariffs on imported goods which the UK also produces has worried farmers, who fear a flood of cheap imported food putting them out of business. In response, the government has said it will not impose zero-rate tariffs on food imports. It will have to balance the interests of consumers, who want to see their food prices kept low, with those of farmers and growers, when setting the tariff rates. Faced with more expensive imported beef for example, shoppers could decide to buy British. But they might not have that choice when it comes to fresh fruit and vegetables. In March, when a lot of the UK's produce is out of season, the country imports 90% of its lettuce, 80% of its tomatoes and 70% of its soft fruit from the European Union, according to the British Retail Consortium, which represents shopkeepers. A no-deal document published by the government said: ""At the time of year we will be leaving the EU, the UK is particularly reliant on the short channel crossings for fresh fruit and vegetables. ""In the absence of other action from government, some food prices are likely to increase, and there is a risk that consumer behaviour could exacerbate, or create, shortages in this scenario."" But it added that less than 1 in 10 food items is expected to be affected. When the value of the pound decreases compared with other currencies, it becomes more expensive to buy things from abroad - a pound that's worth less buys less stuff. That will ""directly affect the cost of getting imported food products onto supermarket shelves"", theInstitute for Fiscal Studies says,external. It gave the comparison of what happened in 2007-08 around the time of the global financial crisis. Sterling depreciated in value by 21% and food prices rose by 8.7% relative to other goods. There were other things going on at the time though, apart from currency exchange rates - there were sharp rises in world prices for things like petroleum and fertiliser. But other countries which did not experience currency depreciations did not experience food price rises as ""large nor as persistent"" as in the UK, the IFS says, suggesting ""exchange rates played an important role in driving higher food prices in the UK"". The pound has fallen in value since the referendum and that is thought to havecontributed to a small rise in food prices, according to a study,externalby the London School of Economics. Another thing which could affect the prices of food for retailers is the cost of having to do extra checks at ports - what's known as ""non-tariff barriers"". The House of Lords' European Union committee in a report on food prices after Brexit said: ""As well as causing delays and shortening the shelf-life of products, non-tariff barriers are an additional cost for businesses"". It quoted a report by consultancy firm KPMG which calculated that ""one day of delay for a lorry will easily cost a business 600 to 1,000 euros"" (Â£500-Â£850). The government has set out steps which businesses should take to minimise disruption at borders. In its recent no-deal document it said it was putting procedures in place to make it easier for traders importing from the EU to comply with customs requirements immediately after Brexit, to ease the effects of those non-tariff barriers. It is set to publish a schedule of the tariffs it plans to impose on goods imported from the EU in the event of a no-deal Brexit shortly. What do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

Meet Wales' shelf-stacking magistrate,"This video can not be played From supermarket aisles to criminal trials From the supermarket check-out to the court room - Luke Penney is not your average magistrate. Neath-born Mr Penney, 22, works part-time at his local Tesco when he is not dealing with defendants at Swansea Magistrates' Court. He applied for the role after a woman asked to put up a flyer in the store, recruiting magistrates. One year into the job, he said he is a ""completely different person"" in court to when he is behind the tills. Here he explains what it's like to be a young magistrate. When I wake up on the morning of court, I'm Luke the magistrate - professional and independent. Integrity is a big part of the role. I like the balance between a normal work life in the supermarket and court. Luke works part-time in the kiosk at his local Tesco store Being a magistrate is challenging, it does test you and your morals. It is just about following your gut instinct. My first case on the job was murder where the suspect made their first appearance in court, before being sent to crown court to be dealt with. It hit me that this responsibility given to society is huge, to keep everyone safe and to look out for the interests of justice. Any case you do is challenging, no matter what court you go into. Behind the job: A young magistrate's story 'Severe shortage' of magistrates Could duty lawyers become extinct? At the end of the day, mentally, you have to leave your work at the court. I'm still the normal Luke who gets home, goes on my phone or TV and does the things any other 22-year-old would. Although it's tough, I'm in this for the long run and want to serve until I'm 70. Luke says: ""The job is challenging - it does test you and your morals"" Since being sworn in, my family are very proud, but I don't think that they know what it entails. My friends didn't believe me at first and immediately asked how much I am paid. But the simple answer is I'm not, it is voluntary. I don't go around saying ""I'm a magistrate"". I keep it personal and if they ask then I'll be open about the process. Criminal court is open and I'd advise anyone to come in and see what we do to see if it's for them. Magistrates are volunteers in their community who hear cases in criminal and family courts Potential applicants must be aged between 18 and 65, but don't need any formal qualifications or legal training They must not have a conflict of interest, such as being a serving police officer The Ministry of Justice for England and Wales look for people who are aware of social issues and are committed to their community. You can find a full list of criteria for the job onthe Ministry of Justice website,external.

Brexit: What the audience wants to know,"With the UK due to leave the European Union (EU) at the end of the month, many people still have questions about what will happen and how Brexit will affect them. Throughout the day, the BBC has invited an audience panel of 12 people to take part in our Brexit coverage, and we've also had additional questions coming in via text and email. Chris Morris, from BBC Reality Check, has been looking at some of them. It's had a big impact already. It's dominating politics and parliamentary time, meaning there's been less time to focus on other issues. Thousands of civil servants have been redeployed from other tasks to work on issues arising from leaving the EU - the Treasury estimates that a third of its staff are working on Brexit. In the future, presuming Brexit happens, there will still be a huge amount to do. Negotiations on our future relations with the EU and the rest of the world will dominate policy-making for years. There's also the issue of money. The government will contribute far less money to the EU budget after Brexit (although it has said it still wants to pay to be part of some programmes). That should lead, over time, to savings of billions of pounds a year - the UK's net contribution to the EU budget in 2017 was Â£8.9bn according to the Treasury. But that needs to be seen in the context of the overall effect of Brexit on the economy. Thegovernment's own economic analysis,externalsaid that leaving the EU with a deal could leave the economy up to 3.9% smaller than it would be if the UK remained in the EU. And leaving with no deal could deliver a 9.3% hit. Either figure, if correct, would dwarf any savings made by paying less into the budget. She doesn't have to apply immediately, and she will be let back in whether there is a deal or not. Brexit doesn't mean people from the rest of Europe are going to be prevented from entering the country - it's just that after the UK leaves the EU they won't automatically have the right to work and remain in the long term. Your wife will, as you say, need to apply for the government's settled status scheme for EU citizens, and having been here for 10 years already there should be no problem in her being accepted, according to Home Office rules. If there is no deal, she has to apply for settled status by 31 December 2020. If there is a deal, she has a bit longer, until the end of June 2021. At the moment any British student can study at a university in the EU for the same fees charged to local students. So if the local students do not pay any fees, the UK students are also entitled to study for free. In total, 10 EU countries, as well as Norway, do not charge undergraduate tuition fees, while in other countries the charge is often very low. France, for example, charges between â¬180 (Â£158) to â¬600 (Â£527) a year at its state-funded universities. Reality Check: Countries where UK students can study for free If the UK leaves the EU with a deal, any UK citizen who has begun studying in another EU country before the end of the post-Brexit transition period (currently until the end of 2020) will retain the right to study on the same terms as that country's own nationals. What happens after that has yet to be negotiated. If there's no deal, UK students will be treated like students from the rest of the world, and how that works varies from country to country. Germany, for example, does not charge fees to any overseas students, but most countries do. The Netherlands, which has low fees for EU students, charges a much higher fee for non-EU students. If there is no deal, the Dutch government said that the UK students already studying in the Netherlands before 29 March 2019 will be treated as before, but those who start after the Brexit date will be treated as non-EU students. Under the deal, the UK agreed to a divorce settlement, to be paid to the EU over time, of between Â£35bn and Â£39bn. The Office for Budget Responsibility estimates that about Â£16.4bn of this will be budget contributions to the EU during the transition period until the end of 2020. The rest, for things like pensions and long-term projects the UK has already promised to fund, would be paid over many years to come. As for EU laws and regulations, the UK would have to abide by all of them during the transition period until December 2020, or longer if the transition were to be extended (it can be extended by up to two years). What happens after that depends on the future deal between the EU and the UK - the closer the UK wants to be to the EU economy, the more it will have to follow its rules. The government has also said it would continue to pay some money into the EU budget so it could participate in some EU programmes in fields such as scientific research and education. Comparing pensions between countries is difficult because the UK state pension is essentially a flat rate with the exact amount dependent on years of contributions and age. German and French pensions are calculated using more complex formulas that depend on previous earnings. The full basic UK State Pension isÂ£125.95 per week,external. This does not include the additional state pension, pension credit or other benefits that some pensioners are eligible for. According toEU data,,externalthe minimum French pension is â¬634.66 per month or around Â£130 a week. The maximum French pension is â¬1,655.5 per month which is around Â£340 a week according to the current exchange rate. In Germany, most workers' pension insurance payments are compulsory but there is no statutory minimum, maximum or full pension. This is another ""deal or no deal"" question. If there is a Brexit deal, everything will stay the same until the end of 2020 at the earliest. But if the UK leaves with no deal, things will change. Your European Health Insurance Card (Ehic), which gives you state-provided emergency healthcare anywhere in the EU, will no longer be valid. In the event of no deal, the government says that if you are travelling on or after 29 March 2019 to EU countries as well as to Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, you should buy travel insurance to cover health care ""just as you would if visiting a non-EU country"". The overall cost of travel - for things like flights and accommodation - depends partly on the value of the pound. It has fallen by about 12% against the euro since the Brexit referendum, which makes holidays in Europe a bit more expensive if you're paying in pounds. There's more on the poundhere. The good news is that there are no plans to introduce visas for trips of less than 90 days, even if there is no deal. After the end of 2020 though, UK citizens wanting to go to most EU countries in the Schengen area (that doesn't include Ireland) will need to buy an online travel permit for 7 euros which would be valid for 3 years.

"Brexit told through Britney, Ariana and Pokemon","Brexit - it seems like it took forever, but now it's finally upon us - with the UK leaving the EU on 31 January 2020. When the referendum was first announced, Kanye and Jay-Z were still friends and Prince Harry and Meghan Markle hadn't even met yet. Sir Alex Ferguson was managing in the Premier League and Will.i.am and Britney were number one. Here are some of the key moments in the Brexit timeline - with a little help from Adele, Pokemon and Leicester City. Prime Minister David Cameronannouncesthat the UK will get a ""very simple in or out choice"" on EU membership - if the Conservatives win the next election. Willi.i.am's Scream & Shout, featuring Britney Spears, is top of the charts and Barack Obama has juststartedhis second term as US president. Fast forward two years, and the Conservativeswinthe election outright and Ed Miliband resigns as Labour leader. Meanwhile, emoji becomes thefastest growing languagein the UK, according to a university professor. After finishing renegotiations on the UK's relationship with the EU, David Cameronannouncesthat there will be a referendum on 23 June 2016. A few days later, Adelecleans upat the Brit Awards, winning best British single for Hello, best British album, best British female solo artist and the global success award. The fact that Leicester City are Premier Leaguechampionsis still sinking in. The referendum is held, and the UKvotes to leave the EU.David Cameron announces his resignation as prime minister. A few days later, Englandlose 2-1to Iceland in Euro 2016, and Roy Hodgson resigns as manager - while Wales make itall the wayto the semi-finals. Prince Harry has recently gone on a blind date with US actress Meghan Markle - although the world won't know this until a few months later. Theresa May becomes the UK's new prime minister andpromises to lead a ""one nation"" governmentthat works for all not just the ""privileged few"". The country spends the rest of the summer getting into mass brawls, using phones while driving and trespassing onto railway tracks - all to try andcatch some Pokemon. Sam Allardyce has justleft his postas England manager after he was secretly filmed discussing how to ""get around"" international football rules, and Gareth Southgate takes temporary charge. Brad Pitt and Angelina Jolie have recentlysplitafter 12 years together - as have Taylor Swift and Tom Hiddlestonafter three months. Prime Minister Theresa Mayannouncesthat the UK will leave the EU on 29 March 2019 - which seems like an age away. Cheryl has just given birth to her and Liam Payne's baby son,Bear. The process for leaving the EU, called Article 50, istriggered- which officially starts the two-year countdown to Brexit. Prime Minister Theresa Maycallsa surprise general election for June, and it's predicted the Conservative party will win easily. The UK has another thing on its mind as well - Ed Sheeran'snew album Ã·(Divide) is taking the charts by storm. In a shock result, the Conservative Partylosesits majority in the House of Commons which makes it a lot harder for Theresa May to pass future laws. The UK - and the world - are at the height of Reggaeton-mania, withDespacitoreigning in the charts. A last-minute deal between the EU and UK isagreed. It says there will be no ""hard border"" between the UK and Ireland, the rights of EU citizens in the UK and UK citizens in the EU will be protected, and the so-called ""divorce bill"" will cost around Â£39bn. Meanwhile every Sunday, the whole nation's getting its mind blown by David Attenborough'sBlue Planet II. A day after Brexit Secretary David Davisresigns,Foreign Secretary Boris Johnsonalso resigns.It's over Theresa May's""Cheqeurs plan"",externalfor leaving the EU. ButEngland'sattention is focused on Russia and Gareth Southgate's waistcoat for the upcoming World Cup semi-final against Croatia. It's England's best chance to reach a final in a generation. Theresa Mayagreesthe text of the withdrawal agreement with the EU, but it's not well-received back in the UK. England's World Cup glory is now just a distant memory after the team failed to make it to the final. Conservative MPs who are unhappy with the prime minister's performance trigger avoteof no confidence in her as party leader - which she wins by 200 to 117. Ariana Grande is in the middle of a six-week run at the top of the charts withThank U, Next. This time, thevoteof no confidence is for the whole of parliament to vote on - not just the Conservatives. It comes after the prime minister's Brexit deal was voted down by MPs. Theresa May wins again - this time 325 to 306. In the National Television Awards, Ant and Dec win - again - for best presenter, making it18 wins in a row. Seven Labour MPs quit their party because of issues which include Brexit. They'rejoinedby another Labour and three Conservative MPs over the next few days. Meanwhile, there is a new twist in the story of Empire actor Jussie Smollett - who had claimed he was attacked two men in a homophobic and racist incident. Police in Chicago say the ""trajectory of the investigation"" has changed and laterarrestand charge him ""disorderly conduct/filing a false police report"". The Prime Minister returns from a meeting in Strasbourg with the news that""legal changes""have been made to her proposed Brexit plans. The most significant amendment centres around the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Meanwhile after dating for two years former baseball star Alex Rodriguez and Jennifer Lopez announce their engagement. He popped the question on a beach in The Bahamas. What a thrashing! With just 16 days before Britain is due to leave the European Union -MPs overwhelmingly reject Theresa May's Brexit dealfor a second time. On the same night Manchester City handed a thrashing of their own - they beat German side Schalke 7-0 (8-2 on aggregate) to secure a Champions League quarter final spot. Some things you just can't get enough of. Game of Thrones, for instance, or time left to leave the EU. In the same week that the UK was granted an extension of the Article 50 period to 31 October, the eighth and final season of Game of Thrones hit screens. The end of Game of Thrones doesn't go down too well with viewers, with more than 1.8 million peoplesigning a petitionto have the whole thing re-done because they didn't like how it ended. OMG, more than a million people are going to storm Area 51 in America to discover the secrets about aliens the US government are keeping secret! Except it never happens - despite all the interest on social media. Things do get serious enough for anofficial warning to be issued,though. Something that does happen in July 2019 is that Boris Johnson becomes Prime Minister, following Theresa May's resignation announcement on 24 May. Boris Johnson promised he would ""get Brexit done"" when he became PM, but if there's one person we really trust to get things done after what goes down in October 2019, it'd be Coleen Rooney. She outs her mate...........Rebekah Vardy's accountas the person allegedly selling stories on her to the tabloids, resulting in one of the most gripping celebrity stories of the year - it's the sort of can-do attitude many people believe the UK was built upon. Boris Johnson does manage to secure another Brexit extension, though. Jacqueline Jossa returns from Australia - a day before Boris Johnson and his girlfriend Carrie Symonds get the keys back to Number 10 While the UK's celebrating Jacqueline Jossa becomingqueen of the jungle,an (arguably) more important vote is about the take place. The third general election in five years results in the Conservative party getting ahuge majority- they go from having fewer than half of the 650 MPs in the House of Commons, to 365. Christmas comes early for Conservatives in the UK - and the result pretty much ends the arguments around whether the UK leaves or remains in the UK. The 31 January leaving date is on. This video can not be played Kobe Bryant: London Lions basketball team pay tribute That's it,we're off(from 11pm). Although nothing really changes on the day the UK officially leave the EU. Not that Big Ben willbong us out,though. But it's somehow not the biggest news story of the week (that's the spread of thecoronavirus). It's not even the second. That's because in the same week as Brexit finally happens, US basketball starKobe Bryantis killed, alongside his daughter, in a helicopter accident.

How it feels to have 'millennial burnout',"Not just another typical âsnowflakeâ issue RhiÃ¢n, 28 I donât remember the last time I relaxed. Honestly? I donât know how to. Every time I try to read a book or watch TV, I think about what I have to do next, or my âto-doâ list flashes before my eyes. I feel guilty because I know that I could be cleaning my flat, or at the gym, or buying a birthday present for my boyfriendâs mum. My brain never stops. Iâm constantly on hyper-alert about the things I should be doing â but just canât bring myself to do. I already suffer from anxiety and depression, and this stress has disrupted my sleep and led me to have mild insomnia. I think Iâm one of many in my generation suffering from âmillennial burnoutâ. This is not currently a recognised medical condition, and there are no specific stats for it, but in the UK,74% of us are so stressed,externalweâve been unable to cope. That same study found that 49% of 18-24-year-olds who have experienced high levels of stress felt that comparing themselves to others was a source of stress, which was higher than in any of the older age groups. This is essentiallyburnout,external- a state of chronic stress that leads to physical and emotional exhaustion. The idea that millennials are experiencing a specific type of âburnoutâ was first popularised by BuzzFeed writer Anne Helen Petersen. Hermuch-shared article,externalÂ on the subject points to the fact that the line between work and life is so blurred for many of us that there is no work-life balance anymore. Plus, weâre online 24/7, so weâre always expected to be available, whether itâs work emails, social messages, or looking for love. It doesnât even stop on holiday. Her article provoked a wide-ranging response, which she edited down into afollow-up piece,external. Anne Helen believes one of the biggest signs you're suffering from this is âerrand paralysisâ, where minor tasks such as going to the bank or returning an online order just feel impossible. âNone of these tasks were that hard,â she wrote. âItâs not as if I were slacking in the rest of my life. But when it came to the mundane, the medium priority, the stuff that wouldnât make my job easier or my work better, I avoided it. The more I tried to figure out my errand paralysis, the more the actual parameters of burnout began to reveal themselvesâ¦ Itâs not limited to workers in acutely high-stress environments. And itâs not a temporary affliction: Itâs the millennial condition.â This is something I fully relate to. My job is a big priority for me, and I put a lot of pressure on myself to work hard. It means I'm always on â replying to emails at all hours, and bringing my work laptop home at night. But while I'm doing well in my career, my personal life admin is a mess. I have endless to-do lists that I never complete. Recently, I even made a list of lists and sectioned it off into the different rooms of my flat, with a weekly list of chores to do by each room. Then I have a list of appointments I need to make, and a shopping list I know Iâll never buy half the stuff on, like ingredients to make packed lunches for the week in order to save money. I often send myself reminder emails the night before I get into work, so when Iâm at my desk, theyâre at the top of my inbox. Itâs my way of trying to stay in control of my spiralling life admin, but when I end up not doing the things on my list, Iâm left feeling even more overwhelmed. Then I bury my head in the sand so I donât have to think about everything Iâm not doing - and end up less productive than before. Itâs a vicious circle. And itâs about more than about making lists. I tend to break my life up into compartments: work, relationship, friends, and family. I want to give all of them equal attention, but I canât do that because there just isn't enough time, so then I feel stressed, guilty, and permanently tired. I overcommit constantly but always manage to make my deadlines with work. The sacrifices are more in my social life where Iâve ended up having to cancel nights out last minute and let down friends who end up angry and disappointed. Itâs affecting all areas of my life and I just donât see an end in sight. This is the main symptom of âmillennial burnoutâ, according to British psychotherapist Beverley Hills. While the condition isnât medically recognised, Hills says it is something she has seen in her clients. âYou can feel stress, insomnia, self-doubt, cynicism, and as though you're in a void, like, âHow can I possibly succeed when there are not enough resources left for me?â There will be emotional exhaustion, a feeling of dissatisfaction, inadequacy, and also anger, and maybe physical pain that could take the form ofFibromyalgia,externalÂ or constant feelings of âunwellness',"" she says. She believes that this burnout can be brought on by âover-expectations from parents, careers, and societyâ. Itâs exacerbated by social media because of the constant pressure to be living your best life, which âleads to a fear of failure and, conversely, a fear of success: 'If I achieve all that, how can I possibly keep it up? I may as well not even try'."" In extreme situations, she says it can even lead to depression or suicidal thoughts, and urges people experiencing millennial burnout to seek medical help like counselling. For me, one of the hardest parts about millennial burnout is that I donât feel Iâm âallowedâ to be this tired. I donât think Iâve earned it or done enough to warrant having burnout. I always compare myself to my mum, who was a single mother working two or three jobs at a time to raise me and my siblings in Wales. I always think, 'How could my mum work all these jobs, cook for us, clean, have all our school uniforms ironed and never complain?' Then I feel worse for whining. But, at the same time, things have changed for our generation. We've internalised the idea that we need to be working all the time, and that being average is no longer enough; we have to always be achieving. Plus, our lives are a lot more 'out there' for everyone to see with social media. My mum had no one to prove to on a daily basis that she was keeping us alive, and that we had the latest toy or computer game. Sheâs really sympathetic to what Iâm going through, and obviously worried about me, but sometimes talking to her makes me feel worse because I canât help comparing myself unfavourably to her. The idea of what a successful career should look like has also changed for my generation. It used to be about earning a decent salary, but now it feels like we need to do that as well as have a cool, exciting job youâre passionate about. Itâs the same with being healthy. For my mum, that meant eating three balanced meals and having clean clothes. For us, that means going to the gym at 5am, doing a run post-work to get cardio in, eating kale at every possible opportunity, and cleansing my skin all the time or Iâll get wrinkles. Itâs all about being hyper-healthy, hyper-clued-up, hyper-fashionable - and itâs exhausting. Last year, I felt so bad that I thought I was going to have a breakdown. Iâd been feeling burnt out for months, and with my to-do list growing as much as my stress levels, I wasnât coping well. I could barely get out of bed or motivate myself to do the simplest of tasks. I was constantly stressed, and I didnât feel like myself at all. I was snapping at my boyfriend, because I had no emotional energy left to give â I was so focused on trying to get through the day. He was worried about me because I wasnât myself, and I even had physical symptoms: my skin broke out with acne for the first time and became flushed with the skin conditionrosacea,external. I was constantly sweating, because I was on hyper-alert - waiting for the next thing to worry about. Eventually, I booked an appointment to see my doctor and told him I felt like I was about to break. He said my anxiety and depression symptoms were exacerbated by feeling burnout, and suggested I take some time off for my mental health. I wasnât surprised by his diagnosis, but the thought of being allowed to stop was such a relief. I took a few weeks off work where I had absolutely nothing to do. I still had my to-do lists going round in my head, and felt like I needed to make the most of my time off, but I was also so exhausted that I just slept. In the end, the time off helped, but a year later, the burnout still hasnât gone away. I'm now looking into therapy as my doctor suggested - even though thatâs now a new source of stress as Iâm struggling to find an affordable one. I'm also doing a lot of reading up on how to manage stress. My go-to is to flare up in an argument with my boyfriend because Iâm so on edge, but I donât want to be like that, so Iâm trying to find other ways of channelling how Iâm feeling instead, like doing creative writing. Iâm also trying to see more of my friends and talk to them about what Iâm going through, because I know a lot of them feel the same way. Last year, I spent a lot of time staying at home trying to get through my lists, and felt guilty about going for beers with my friends and wasting money. But now I need to remind myself that being with people helps because it makes me feel less alone, and it takes me out of my head. I know a lot of people think this is another typical âmillennial snowflakeâ issue. But the world changes and generations adapt. I know life was also difficult for our parents and grandparents, with a lot more hard graft, but things are tough now in different ways. If previous generations knew what I went through on a daily basis, they wouldnât think of millennials as lazy and entitled. Weâre just trying to do our best, and often, it's harder than it looks.

Landlord rent checks 'breach human rights',"Rules aimed at preventing illegal immigrants from renting properties are ""discriminatory"" and breach human rights laws, the High Court has ruled. The ""right to rent"" scheme, which requires landlords to check the immigration status of tenants, was introduced in England in 2016. Judges said it would be illegal to roll it out in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland without further evaluation. The Home Office said it was ""disappointed"" by the ruling. Mr Justice Spencer said the scheme had ""little or no effect"" on its main aim of controlling immigration and even if it had, this was ""significantly outweighed by the discriminatory effect"". He added that the evidence ""strongly showed"" the scheme was causing landlords to discriminate against potential tenants because of their nationality and ethnicity. The scheme, the judge said in hisruling,external, appeared to be having a ""real effect"" on people's ability to find accommodation and the MPs who voted for it ""would be aghast"" to see its consequences. Right to Rent 'leads to discrimination' Reality Check: Has the 'hostile environment' worked? The challenge was brought by the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants (JCWI), which claimed the scheme was ""race discrimination against those who are perfectly entitled to rent"". Responding to the ruling, legal policy director Chai Patel said there was ""no place for racism in the UK housing market"". He added that the judgement ""only reveals the tip of the iceberg"" and called on Parliament to scrap the policy. The Residential Landlords Association also welcomed the ruling and said the policy had turned landlords into ""untrained and unwilling border police"". The group said its research had found that fear of getting things wrong led to private landlords being less likely to rent to those without a British passport or those with limited time to remain in the UK. The Home Office said an independent study found no evidence of systematic discrimination in its policy and the scheme was intended to discourage illegal residence in the UK. It said it had been granted permission to appeal and was giving careful consideration to the judge's comments. By Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondent Discrimination cases are very difficult to win. What was critical in this case was the independent evidence of discrimination, including that gathered by the Joint Council for the Welfare of Immigrants in two mystery shopping exercises where identical applications were made to landlords but with key details such as names changed. The aim was to determine whether decisions were being made on the basis of ethnicity or nationality. Where people could provide a UK passport, there was no evidence of ethnicity discrimination. However, when they could not, the person with an ethnic name was less successful in gaining a tenancy than the one with a white British name. This showed that landlords concerned about a possible prosecution under the right to rent scheme were looking at ethnicity as a means of refusing prospective tenants. That is what led Mr Justice Spencer to conclude the scheme ""does not merely provide the occasion or opportunity for private landlords to discriminate but causes them to do so where otherwise they would not"", describing such discrimination by landlords a being ""logical and wholly predicable"" when faced with potential sanctions and penalties for getting things wrong. The ""right to rent"" scheme,which was first trialled in the West Midlands, requires landlords to carry out checks on prospective tenants, such as seeing their passport or visa. Failing to do so is a criminal offence, carrying a maximum penalty of five years' imprisonment or a fine. The scheme is part of the government's ""hostile environment"" policy, which aimed to reduce the number of illegal immigrants in the UK, and was introduced under the 2014 Immigration Act. Lara ten Caten, a solicitor with Liberty, which intervened in the case, said the judgement was ""another nail in the coffin for the government's misguided, discriminatory and unworkable hostile environment policy"". ""While effective immigration control is a legitimate aim for any government, the Home Office must stop outsourcing its discriminatory policies to third parties who are ill-equipped to enforce them but may be slapped with heavy fines and even end up in prison if they don't,"" she said. Mohamed, who did not wish to use his surname, says the right to rent checks proved an ""extremely difficult hurdle"" in his search for a London home. He is British and his wife is legally in the UK on a spouse visa. But Mohamed says they were turned down numerous times before eventually finding accommodation because landlords appeared worried about falling foul of the Home Office regulations. ""The rule needs to be scrapped,"" he adds.  ""Finding affordable rental property is difficult enough for people without the added hassle of being refused for no other reason than being foreign.""

Vodafone sorry over See You Jimmy 'joke',"Mr Shabbir has worked with the firm for eight years Vodafone has apologised after a manager posed in a See You Jimmy hat in an ""insulting"" social media post amid jobs losses in Scotland. Antonio Shabbir, a customer operations director, was also holding a bottle of Irn Bru in the picture posted on the company's staff intranet on Wednesday. It came weeks after it was confirmed 312 jobs in the Berkeley Square office, Glasgow, would be relocated or face redundancy. The firm said ""no offence was meant"". It is believed the picture, which was captioned ""some exciting news to share"", has since been deleted. Vodafone staff told move or be redundant Vodafone said the image was posted in order to promote a competition in which employees could win an all expenses paid trip to Edinburgh. A spokesman for the company said: ""Mr Shabbir has apologised and he is mortified that it caused offence. ""It is just really unfortunate he used those props without thinking, the timing of it wasn't very clever and he understands that."" When asked if Mr Shabbir faced disciplinary action over the post, the spokesman said: ""It is not something we are considering."" A statement from the firm added: ""It was an internal event. No offence was meant and we apologise unreservedly."" Staff at Vodafone's Glasgow contact centre were given the news on Tuesday At the end of January Vodafone staff in Glasgow were told hundreds would be forced to move to Manchester, Stoke-on-Trent or Newbury in order to retain their positions. MP Alison Thewliss, whose constituency includes the Berkeley Square office,criticised the move in the House of Commons on Thursday,external, adding the social media stunt ""added insult to injury"". It came during the business statement from Andrea Leadsom, who said the ""joke"" was ""in extremely poor taste"". Job losses in Glasgow have come as part of a wider restructuring process at Vodafone in which smaller offices will be closed down. Thursday marked the end of a three month consultation process, during which employees were asked whether they could move to offices in England. Vodafone insisted the recent cuts did not mean the firm was leaving Scotland or closing the Glasgow office. A Vodafone spokesman added: ""Our teams are currently spread out in smaller offices across the UK. ""We are moving some people into larger centres of excellence across our consumer, digital and technology operations. ""This will impact 312 employees currently based in our Glasgow office.  Our consultation process is ongoing with these employees to assess their individual circumstances; we want to retain as many of the people affected by these changes as possible. ""We will still have an employee base of around 410 employees at the office in Berkeley Square and more than 500 employees based at our partner customer service centre in Kilmarnock. ""We will continue to invest more widely in Scotland. Glasgow will be one of our main 5G test beds and we are rolling out full fibre broadband to three Scottish cities in partnership with CityFibre.""

But her relatives said she died on Wednesday in Harefield Hospital ""surrounded by family and friends"". She was one of only two people in the UK with an artificial heart. Her family said: ""Becca was a beautiful, brilliant shining light in our lives. ""It was a privilege to have her as a daughter and a friend. Heaven has gained the brightest new star. We will love her forever."" Rebecca Henderson relied on this artificial heart to pump blood around her body The Oxford University post-graduate student had her heart removed due to cancer in 2017.

Final assault on IS in Syria 'begins',"This video can not be played The faces of the people abandoning IS's final territory in Syria US-backed forces battling Islamic State in Syria say they have launched their final assault on the jihadists' last pocket of control in the country. ""Nothing remains in Baghuz except for terrorists,"" a spokesman for the Kurdish-led SDF alliance said, referring to the IS militants. The village in eastern Syria has been besieged by the SDF for several weeks. The offensive was delayed to allow thousands of civilians, mostly women and children, to be evacuated. SDF (Syrian Democratic Forces) spokesman Mustafa Bali said his forces moved into the village, which lies on the eastern bank of the Euphrates river near the Iraqi border, at 16:00 GMT - after the final batch of civilians had left. ""We expect a fierce and heavy battle,"" he told Reuters news agency. Mr Bali declined to speculate on how long the final push might take, but the SDF said on Thursday it expected a final victory within a week. Baghuz is the last territorial stronghold IS has in Syria. Its fall would be significant, but experts warn that the group will continue to remain a security threat as long as its ideological pull endures. Exclusive pictures of final Islamic State group bastion Tales from inside the chaos left by IS Why countries face a dilemma over IS children About 20,000 civilians have been taken by the SDF to a makeshift camp for displaced people at al-Hol, in Hassakeh province, in recent weeks. Among them are the wives and children of IS militants and many foreign nationals. The Kurdish-led SDF has laid siege to Baghuz in eastern Syria for several weeks A number of men belonging to IS have also surrendered in recent days. Some were found with hidden weapons during their surrender, according to pro-SDF Kurdish Ronahi TV. Hundreds of other IS militants remain in Baghuz but an exact number is unclear. On the messaging app Telegram, IS supporters have launched a hashtag campaign calling for divine intervention in support of the jihadists. At its height, five years ago, IS controlled 88,000 sq km (34,000 sq miles) of territory stretching from western Syria to eastern Iraq. The SDF says the jihadist group has now been contained to an area of less than half a square kilometre. Islamic State and the crisis in Iraq and Syria in maps Thousands of refugees have been returning home as gains have been made against IS. Kurdish authorities said a group of 21 Yazidi women and children returned to Iraq from Syria on Friday after more than four years in captivity. IS militants killed or kidnapped more than 9,000 members of the minority religious group in what the United Nations has called ""genocide"". Please upgrade your browser to view this content.

LK Bennett on brink of collapse,"The Duchess of Cambridge is an LK Bennett fan High-end fashion chain LK Bennett has lined up an administrator for the business as it desperately seeks funding to stay afloat. EY will oversee the insolvency if no new investment can be found,according to Sky,externalwhich first reported the story. The firm, which counts the Duchess of Cambridge among its customers, has 41 shops and 480 staff in the UK with many more shops and concessions globally. Famed for its kitten-heel shoes, it was founded by Linda Bennett in 1990. Ms Bennett - who was awarded an OBE in 2006 - said her aim was to bring ""a bit of Bond Street luxury to the High Street"". She sold her majority stake in the chain to private equity firm Phoenix Equity Partners in 2008, but in 2017 returned to advise the business after the retailer started to struggle, and a short time later bought the company back. The chain reported an operating loss of nearly Â£6m in the year to the end of July 2017, the most recent results available for the firm. The accounts show that on her return, Ms Bennett invested about Â£11.2m into the business. City centres 'could become ghost towns' Three things that could save the High Street In an email to staff, Ms Bennett said she had ""fought as hard as I can, with all your help to turn the business into the success that I know it deserves to be"". ""These are difficult and unstable times, and we are doing everything we can to identify the best way forward,"" she added. Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said the news was unexpected: ""This latest victim of the high street slump is as surprising as when Orla Kiely went into administration in September last year. ""If the British retail industry wasn't already nervous about business, it will be rocked to see that a second business with a  seemingly strong, high end core of customers has entered administration."" The chain's clothing is priced at the higher end of the High Street, with many of its dresses costing about Â£300. Catherine Shuttleworth, chief executive at shopper marketing agency Savvy, said this was one of the reasons it was struggling. ""Whilst it might be okay for Duchesses, most women will have to think twice before spending over Â£200 on a dress let alone Â£300. That combined with expensive store estates and a shopper who is spending more and more time online, it seems like the numbers aren't stacking up,"" she said. By Emma Simpson, BBC Business Correspondent Linda Bennett is one of Britain's most successful female entrepreneurs. She sold her business for around Â£70m. But founders who've built a business from scratch often find it difficult to let go. She bought it back again in late 2017, for a tiny fraction of the price. She admitted it was a risky move, given the incredibly challenging conditions on the High Street.  For any retailer, cashflow is king. I understand a key lender reduced the amount of money the business could borrow, and that a lack of credit insurance also added to the problems. Serious IT issues with its website and operational systems over the summer didn't help.  It meant that Linda Bennett was having to pour more and more of her own money in to keep the business afloat. A looming quarterly rent bill and rising business rates appears to have been the final straw. Administration now seems highly likely. Will she finally walk away from her beloved business or try to turn it around in a leaner, more sustainable form?  If she does, then it may be time to review its prices. LK Bennett is firmly on the High Street yet often twice as expensive as rivals, but it lacks the cachet to compete with the global designer brands. LK Bennett is one of a string of well-known names suffering in a tough High Street environment. Last year, Poundworld, Toys R Us and Maplin all went bust and disappeared from British High Streets altogether. Other household names - Homebase, Mothercare, Carpetright and New Look - were forced into restructuring deals with their landlords, closing hundreds of stores. Music chain HMV recently fell into administration before being bought. Uncertainty over Brexit, which sparked a fall in the pound and therefore raised the price of imported goods, as well as rising labour costs, higher business property taxes and the increasing popularity of online shopping have all contributed to retailers' woes.

Vaccine deniers gaining ground - NHS boss,"The head of NHS England has warned that ""vaccination deniers"" are gaining traction on social media as part of a ""fake news"" movement. Simon Stevens said parents were seeing ""fake messages"" online about vaccines, which was making it harder to ""win the public argument"" on vaccination. NHS England is considering what action can be taken to stop such messages spreading, Mr Stevens said. He said the health service needed to support parents on the issue. YouTube takes ads off 'anti-vax' video channels Anti-vaccine views wrong - chief doctor UK 'eliminates measles' for first time MMR vaccine target met in England Speaking at a health summit held by the Nuffield Trust think tank, Mr Stevens said that there had been a ""steady decline"" in the uptake of the measles vaccine over the last five years. He went on to describe the uptake of the MMR vaccine among five-year-olds in England (87.5% compared with the World Health Organization target of 95%) as a ""real problem"". He said: ""Across the world, two to three million lives are saved each year by vaccination. ""But as part of the fake news movement, actually the vaccination deniers are getting some traction... ""We are not being helped on this front by the fact that although nine in 10 parents support vaccination, half of them say they have seen fake messages about vaccination on social media."" Mr Stevens said parents at his daughter's primary school have expressed concern about vaccines. ""This is probably not something I should be saying, but I'll anonymously read you one of the WhatsApp messages from one of the parents. ""'My kids aren't vulnerable and I think loading up on vaccines blocks their systems from fighting disease as it should do'."" ""We have a responsibility for the nine out of 10 to really explain it's not just of interest for your own children but herd immunity for other children as well."" In January,the Royal Society for Public Health (RSPH) warned that social media is helping to spread ""misleading and dangerous information""about vaccines. Experts called for more to be done to challenge untruths about possible side effects of vaccines and said that social media giants should clamp down on ""fake news"". The study said social media is a ""breeding ground for misleading information and negative messaging around vaccination"". Mr Stevens added: ""Frankly it's as irresponsible to tell parents that their children shouldn't be vaccinated as it is to say don't bother - to your kids on their way to primary school - to look both ways when they cross the road. ""As a health service we've really got to help support parents on this.""

Feminine job titles get go-ahead in France,"Women firefighters are already often called sapeuses-pompiÃ¨res Decades after other French-speaking countries adopted feminine names for professions, the official guardians of the language in France have also backed the change. The AcadÃ©mie franÃ§aise, whose members are known as ""immortals"", has said it has no obstacle in principle to such a ""natural evolution"" of French. Feminine forms for jobs like prosecutor or firefighter are already often used. But until recently the academy objected to such changes as ""barbaric"". Row over 'sexist' language riles France Why do some job adverts put women off applying? In its report it said ""the academy considers that all developments aiming at recognising in language the place of women in today's society can be foreseen, as long as they do not contravene the elementary and fundamental rules of language"". It will now accept, for example,professeurefor a woman teacher instead of the masculineprofesseur. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

But the male-dominated body, which dates back to the 17th Century, said it would not draw up an ""exhaustive list"" of names, accepting that it would be an insurmountable task. It pointed out that several feminine versions ofauteur(author) had already come into usage, includingauteure, autoresseandautrice. Some French jobs already have feminine forms such asinfirmiÃ¨re(nurse) but the vast majority of job titles are masculine. The feminine definitive article is commonly used to distinguish between sexes, for examplela juge(judge) orla ministre(minister). Any changes may simply be a matter of making formal a job title that already exists. Some will just have an extra ""e"" as a suffix and maybe an accent, such asprÃ©fÃ¨te(prefect),dÃ©putÃ©e(MP)avocate(lawyer)and procureure(prosecutor). The AcadÃ©mie franÃ§aise was first established in the 17th Century Then there issapeuse-pompiÃ¨re(firefighter) rather thansapeur-pompier. Other francophone countries such as Belgium, Switzerland, Luxembourg and Canada already have feminine forms for jobs. Half ministry jobs given to women in Ethiopia The termscheffe (female chef), Ã©crivaine(writer) andingÃ©nieure(engineer) have been used in Canada for 40 years. A doctor is calledune mÃ©decinorune docteure. Not all feminised job titles have gone down well. Author Laura-MaÃ¯ Gaveriaux said she did not want to be described as an ""autrice"" as it just sounded bad. On the other hand she said she liked the feminine terms for director and teacher.

Spain plans no-deal rights for Britons,"Tens of thousands of UK pensioners live in Spain Spain's cabinet has approved measures for Britons in Spain to continue living there as now if the UK leaves the EU without a deal. Foreign Minister Josep Borrell said the main purpose was that no-one, British or Spanish, would be left unprotected. Spain estimates that the measures, which would become law under a no-deal Brexit, would grant residency rights to about 400,000 UK citizens. UK MPs have so far rejected PM Theresa May's withdrawal deal with the EU. That raises the prospect of the UK leaving without a deal on 29 March. More than 300,000 Britons are currently registered as residing in Spain, the government in Madrid says. There are at least 150,000 Spaniards currently residing in the UK. Mr Borrell said the measures ""of temporary nature"" were aimed at protecting the interests of Spanish and British citizens as well as trade between the two countries. The withdrawal agreement - what it all means Brexit: A really simple guide Deal or no deal - how are EU countries preparing? How many Brits abroad are there? Earlier on Friday,the EU rejected calls for an agreementto protect citizens from the UK and the rest of the bloc in the event of a no-deal Brexit. It said it would ""not negotiate mini deals"" as that would imply negotiations had failed. About 1.3 million UK-born people are resident in the other 27 member states of the EU, while the UK hosts about 3.2 million EU27 nationals. The withdrawal deal would enable UK citizens to keep their current freedom of movement and other EU citizenship rights until 31 December 2020, when the Brexit transition period is set to end. There is huge uncertainty about what a no-deal Brexit would mean for Britons in the EU. The priority for most will be to register as residents, but the rules vary from country to country. The plan envisages that Britons living in Spain would have to apply for the ""foreigner identity card"" before 31 December 2020 to prove their legal residency status. Spain's El Pais newspaper reports that the process would be ""nearly automatic"" for those UK nationals who already have permanent residency. The plan of Spain's Socialist Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez would be dependent on the UK reciprocating with similar measures for Spaniards residing in the UK. The decree has measures covering health care, social security, education and many other fields, ABC website reports. Mr SÃ¡nchez has said he wants to secure all rights for British citizens in Spain regardless of what happens. London and Madrid have already signed a deal ensuring voting and working rights for respective migrants - but healthcare was not mentioned in that agreement. About 70,000 British pensioners live in Spain Brexit healthcare worries for Brits in Spain The contingency plan will also cover Gibraltar, although certain additional provisions may apply, including Spain's power of veto over issues relating to the British Overseas Territory in any future agreement between the UK and the EU. Some 9,000 Spanish citizens work in Gibraltar, and the government in Madrid says the measures would be contingent on them receiving the same rights as British citizens, El PaÃ­s says. UK objects to description of Gibraltar as 'British colony' in EU law Last year about 18 million Britons visited Spain, and the government in Madrid hopes the contingency plan will limit damage that a no-deal Brexit might do to the tourist industry - a key sector of Spain's economy.

Brexit and holidays: What do I need to know?,"Rules on travelling between the UK and European Union countries change on 1 January 2021, after an agreement to keep many rules the same for 11 months after Brexit comes to an end. At the moment, no. Because of Covid, travellers from most non-EU countries can't visit except for essential reasons. After 31 December, the UK will no longer be treated like a member of the EU, so becomes subject to these rules. The only non-EU countries exempt from these restrictions are those with very low infection rates, such as New Zealand. The EU could choose to exempt the UK, and individual EU countries could create a ""travel corridor"" with the UK, allowing restriction-free travel. If the rules are changed, you'll be able to travel to all EU countries - plus Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein - as a tourist, without needing a visa. 10 things to look for in the Brexit deal You'll be able to stay for up to 90 days in any 180-day period. So, an Easter weekend in Spain, followed by a June fortnight in Italy, would be covered by your 90-day limit. The rules for Bulgaria, Croatia, Cyprus and Romania are different. You could make a 90-day trip to any of them and still not use up your 90-day allowance for other EU countries. You may need a visa or permit to stay for longer, to work or study, or forbusiness travel.,external From 2022, UK nationals will have to pay for avisa-waiver scheme,externalin order to visit many European countries. No. Your current passport will be valid as long as: It is less than 10 years old And has six months left before it runs out The six-month rule won't apply for visits to Ireland, because it is part ofthe Common Travel Area.,external If you need a new passport -which will be a different colour- the government says youshould apply in plenty of time.,external The European Health Insurance Card (EHIC)has entitled about 27 million UK citizens to state-provided medical treatment if they fall ill or have an accident in EU countries, as well as a number of others. All EHIC cards issued before the end of 2020 will be valid until their expiry date (on the front of your card). The government says it will issue a new card, called the UK Global Health Insurance Card (GHIC). Like EHIC, it will cover chronic or existing illnesses, routine maternity care and emergencies. However, there are no further details yet on when it will start. Its advice,externalis that you should buy travel insurance with healthcare cover before going on holiday - especially if you have a pre-existing medical condition. You'll no longer be able to use EU fast-track passport control and customs lanes. When you arrive in an EU country (except Ireland), be prepared to show your return ticket. You could also be asked to show that you have enough money for your stay. It could also takelonger to cross the UK border.,external The guarantee of free roaming throughout the EU, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Norwayends on 1 January 2021. You should check with your mobile provider to see if you're likely to face extra charges. The four main UK operators have said they have no plans to reintroduce roaming fees. The EU and the UK agreed to co-operate on international mobile roaming. But there is nothing in the post-Brexit trade agreement that would stop travellers being charged for using their phone in the EU, and vice versa, in the future. The government has passed laws to protect customers, including: A Â£45-a-month cap on using mobile data abroad (then you must opt in to use more) Requirements for customers to be informed when they've reached 80% and 100% of their data allowance Yes, but you'll need to take your driving licence, as well as your log book (V5C) and valid insurance documents if you are taking your own car. You will need to contact your insurer six weeks before you travel to get a green card that will prove you have insurance. Most drivers will not need to buy an International Driving Permit, with the exception of those with paper licences (not photocards) and those with licences issued in Gibraltar, Guernsey, Jersey or the Isle of Man, who will need one for some European countries. What are the rules on driving in the EU after transition? Pet passports issued in Great Britain will not be valid for travel to the EU from 1 January 2021. From that date,pets travelling from Great Britain to the EU will need to have an animal health certificate (AHC).,externalThe same rules will apply if you are taking your pet to Northern Ireland. In 2002, this dog was the first to travel to the UK using a pet passport AHCs will be issued by a vet, will be valid for four months and must be obtained no more than 10 days before travel. AHCs will be valid for a single trip into the EU, onward travel within the EU and re-entry to Great Britain. Your pet must have been microchipped and have had a rabies vaccination. It will also have to have a treatment againstEchinococcus multilocularis(a type of tapeworm) for entry into Finland, Republic of Ireland, Northern Ireland, Norway or Malta.

Modi v Khan: Who won the propaganda battle?,"With the release of the Indian pilot captured by Pakistan, tensions between the two nuclear-armed countries over the attack in Kashmir are expected to abate. So who won the battle of perception during the crisis? On Thursday afternoon Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan announced in parliament that Pakistan would release the captured Indian pilot as a ""peace gesture"". In Delhi, Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi, was addressing a meeting of scientists. Moments after Mr Khan's remarks, he responded with a sarcastic broadside against Pakistan, saying that a ""pilot project had been completed"" and ""now we have to make it real"".  While his supporters cheered, others found the remark cocky and tasteless. India and Pakistan in 'uncharted waters' On Tuesday, hours after Indian fighter jets entered Pakistani territory and bombed an alleged terrorist training camp, Mr Modi had opened a packed campaign rally - crucial general elections are barely a month away - with a bravado-laced flourish. ""I want to assure you that the country is in safe hands,"" he told the meeting, to deafening applause. Less than 24 hours later, Pakistan struck back, shooting down an Indian fighter jet in Pakistan-administered Kashmir and capturing pilot Abhinandan Varthaman. Pakistan said Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman was treated well While both sides were under immense pressure to calm tensions, Mr Khan reached out and offered to release the pilot. Former Indian diplomat and strategic affairs expert KC Singh remarked that hawks in Mr Modi's BJP and the Indian establishment ""will be stranded by Imran Khan's diplomatic reverse swing"". (A reverse swing in cricket is the art of swinging the ball when it turns in towards the batsman rather than moving away from him. Mr Khan was one of the world's finest cricketers in his sporting days.) Since he swept to power in 2014, Mr Modi has retained a vice-like grip over the narrative. Helping him is a largely obsequious local media, which faithfully boosts his image of a muscular nationalist. So, many wondered why Mr Modi had chosen his bureaucrats and military to do the talking to the media and not addressed the people himself at a time when the country was on a knife-edge and awash with rumours of an imminent war with a nuclear-armed neighbour. Among those miffed were India's main opposition parties. Twenty-one of them criticised Mr Modi for continuing to attend election meetings and political events and even launch a mobile app during, what was arguably, the biggest security crisis of his tenure. Many believe that Pakistan had blindsided Mr Modi with a quick and brazen retaliatory attack in which it brought down an Indian fighter jet and captured the pilot. Over the next two days Mr Khan called for de-escalation of hostilities, talked about peace and announced that the pilot would be freed. KC Singh says the Pakistani prime minister portrayed a picture of ""dignified moderation and readiness to settle differences through talks"" and took everyone by surprise with his decision to send back the Indian pilot. Pakistani soldiers stand by what Pakistan says is wreckage from a downed Indian jet Mr Khan spoke to his people and defence officials kept the media updated regularly. The prime minister, many analysts in India say, came across looking as a ""reasonable leader"" by not trying to corner India, and allowing an exit route for cessation of hostilities. Mr Modi appeared to lose control of the narrative. ""Any which way you spin it, Pakistan's attack took India by surprise,"" says Srinath Raghavan, historian and author, most recently of Fierce Enigmas: A History of the United States in South Asia. Consider this. India struck Pakistan in the middle of the night in what was a retaliatory action for the attack in Pulwama on 14 February in which more than 40 Indian troops were killed. Pakistan's response was swift and audacious, striking India in broad daylight the next day. 14 to 15 February:A suicide bomber kills at least 40 paramilitary police in Pulwama, in Indian-administered Kashmir, which is thenclaimed by Pakistan-based militant group Jaish-e-Mohammad. Pakistan denies any role in the attack, but Indiavows to ""completely isolate"" the countryfrom the rest of the world. 18 February:A gun battle breaks out as Indian troops search for militants in Kashmir, and nine people die. Meanwhile, Kashmiris living across Indiaare threatened and, in some cases, reportedly attacked. 19 February:Pakistanwarns India against attackingas tensions between the two countries increase. 26 February:India launches air strikes in Balakot,which is in Pakistani territory. These are the first strikes launched across the Line of Control (LoC) since a war between the two nations in 1971. India says the strikes were targeting a militant camp nearby, but Pakistan disputes this claim. 27 February:Pakistan says itshot down two Indian military jetsand captured an Indian pilot, Abhinandan Varthaman. Pakistan's information ministry publishes - and then deletes - a video showing Mr Varthaman blindfolded and with blood on his face. 1 March:Pakistan returns the captured Indian pilot, andhe's greeted by cheering crowds on the Indian side of the border. People in Horran, the Pakistan-controlled village where the plane was downed,claim that he opened firebefore his aircraft was shot down. The capture of the pilot meant that the narrative and expectations of Mr Modi and his government were thrown off kilter and the upbeat narrative of the morning before had now completely changed to bringing the pilot home. The Indian military briefing came more than 30 hours after the Pakistani attack. Mr Modi and his government had clearly little headroom to control the narrative. In the end, trying to control the narrative through bravado can easily backfire. Mr Modi is not the first prime minister to face a security situation provoked by Pakistan-based terror groups: his predecessors Atal Behari Vajpayee and Manmohan Singh faced similar provocations from across the border and had similar capabilities to strike back, but took calculated decisions to lower the temperature. ""Revenge cannot be a strategic objective. Any strategy driven by emotions is likely to fail,"" says Mr Raghavan. Large parts of the press at home have spun the freeing of the Indian pilot as Mr Modi's victory. Very few people are asking questions about the massive intelligence failure that led to the attack in Pulwama, and how Pakistan could penetrate air defences in broad daylight. India's military has not even achieved its strategic aim to establish a new normal in which it would deter Pakistan-backed terrorism in India with the threat of automatic military strikes, says Ajai Shukla, a leading defence analyst. ""So far, Pakistan has demonstrated it can match India, and this requires the Indian military to escalate the punishment to a level that Pakistan cannot match. However, decades of neglect and under-funding have hollowed out India's military to the point where Mr Modi cannot rely on its capability to punish Pakistan swiftly and relatively bloodlessly,"" he says. Also details of the extent of damage inflicted on the alleged terrorist camp in Pakistan by the Indian jets is still unclear. Indian authorities are not clear how many people died in the raid, although sections of the media have freely reported some 300 militants had been killed. By all accounts, Mr Modi should be staring at hard questions and fearing that he's lost the narrative. Indians celebrated on hearing news of the strikes But it may not be so. Many believe Mr Khan may have won the battle of perception with his domestic constituency and some Indians at home, but Mr Modi will continue to control the narrative with his base in India. ""It's a larger constituency than the people who do not believe Mr Modi. With a near-complete control over the media narrative, I do not really see him losing the battle of perception. His supporters will believe that while Mr Modi went about his business as usual, Mr Khan was forced to speak up and release the pilot under pressure,"" says Santosh Desai, columnist and author, most recently, of Mother Pious Lady - Making Sense of Everyday India. Whoever has won the battle of perceptions, there in one silver lining in this sorry saga. According to Vipin Narang, professor of political science at MIT, neither side seems to want a war. He believes that they ""have had their Cuban Missile Crisis moment and recognise how a couple of wrong turns could set off uncontrollable escalation"". So both sides could get back to business. ""Pakistan could finally crack down on terrorism and avoid getting the music started. India could continue strategic restraint,"" he says. Why is Twitter's Jack Dorsey wanted in India?

Who is captured Indian pilot Abhinandan?,"Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman Indian air force pilot Abhinandan Varthaman, captured by Pakistani forces on Wednesday, has become the point of focus amid tensions between the two countries. The fighter pilot, who has 16 years of experience, is from the southern city of Chennai (formerly known as Madras). His jet was shot down in what Islamabad called a ""retaliation"" to India conducting air strikes in its territory. His capture was seen as a major setback for India. The government demanded his immediate release and Indian social media was full of tweets about him, with many calling him a hero and praying for his safe return. He was returned to much jubilation two days later, in what Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan described as a ""peace gesture"". Dramatic details of how he was captured in Pakistan have been revealed. ""I saw the Indian flag on his parachute and knew he was Indian. I also saw his plane get hit and saw him float down,"" Mohammad Razzaq Chaudhry, a resident of Bhimber district in Pakistani-administered Kashmir who witnessed the moment the jet was shot down on Wednesday, told BBC's Ilyas Khan. He added that locals rushed to the fallen pilot and that he was ""afraid"" that they might harm him. Mr Chaudhry said that some of the men were angry and attacked the pilot while others tried to stop them. ""I told them not to harm him - to leave him alone  until the army comes.""

Local media in India reported that crowds began thronging his family home soon after news of his capture spread. The Hindustan Times newspaper quoted one of his relatives as saying that they wanted the government to ""secure his release"" without delay. His family has refused to comment about his capture. The son of a decorated former fighter pilot, Wing Cdr Abhinandan was first commissioned as a fighter pilot in 2004. His mother is a doctor. He is reported to be in his mid-30s. His father, Air Marshal Simhakutty Varthaman, worked with decorated Tamil film maker Mani Ratnam, acting as an adviser for his 2017 film, Kaatru Veliyidai, which was set against the backdrop of the 1999 Kargil conflict between India and Pakistan. Mr Varthaman was the air marshal at the time. The Kargil conflict was the last time an Indian solider was captured and held by Pakistani forces. Group Captain K Nachiketa, who was also an air force pilot, was in Pakistan's custody for eight days after his jet crashed in their territory. Anti-India protesters in Pakistan have printed posters showing Abhinandan He is now retired and lives in the southern city of Hyderabad. ""He [Wing Cdr Abhinandan] should be treated appropriately as an officer and sent back to India,"" Group Captain Nachiketa told BBC Telugu. ""He is brave and courageous and we are all proud of him."" He added that he did not want to talk about his capture but said that ""all officers are trained for this and I am sure he will be with us shortly and join his unit again soon."" A clip of his appearance on a local television show,external- NDTV Good Times - in 2011 is also being circulated widely. In it, he is heard joking about how you need a ""bad attitude"" to be a successful fighter pilot. He also talks about how you trust your colleagues with your life, referring to ""blind faith"" in your co-pilot when you're in the air. India and Pakistan in 'uncharted waters' Air strikes a 'major escalation' India demands Pakistan release pilot India had initially said that all of its pilots were accounted for, contradicting Pakistani claims that they had captured a pilot. However Pakistan's information ministry then released - and later deleted - a video showing the pilot blindfolded and with blood on his face. This prompted a furious Delhi to summon Islamabad's deputy high commissioner and condemn what it called the ""vulgar display of an injured personnel"". In later footage, Wing Commander Abhinandan could be seen sipping tea from a cup without a blindfold. He appeared to have been cleaned up. He said his name, military position and that he was from ""down south"", but refused to share any details when asked about his mission: ""I'm not supposed to tell you that."" In what appeared to be an edited statement aired on Pakistan TV minutes before he was handed over, the wing commander praised the Pakistani army, adding he saw potential for peace. The wing commander also criticised the Indian press, saying they always exaggerate and say a lot of damaging things that mislead people. Allow Twitter content?

Government pays ÃÂ£33m over Brexit ferry case,"The government will pay Â£33m to Eurotunnel in an agreement to settle a lawsuit over extra ferry services in the event of a no-deal Brexit. In December, the Department for Transport (DfT) contracted three suppliers to provide additional freight capacity on ferries for lorries. But Eurotunnel said the contracts were handed out in a ""secretive"" way. As part of the agreement, Eurotunnel has agreed to make some improvements to its terminal. One of the firms awarded a ferry contract, Seaborne Freight, has already had its deal cancelled after the Irish company backing it pulled out. Shortly after it was awarded the contract, theBBC found out that Seaborne had no shipsand had never run a ferry service. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has been heavily criticised for the Seaborne deal, which would have been worth Â£13.8m. In January, Eurotunnel wrote to Mr Grayling to complain that it had not been considered when the contracts were awarded. It argued that unlike Seaborne, it has actually run a cross-Channel ferry service (MyFerryLink, which closed in 2015) and should have been approached. Ferry case adds to list of Grayling mishaps No-deal-Brexit port funding axed In a statement accompanying the agreement, Mr Grayling said: ""While it is disappointing that Eurotunnel chose to take legal action on contracts in place to ensure the smooth supply of vital medicines, I am pleased that this agreement will ensure the Channel Tunnel is ready for a post-Brexit world."" Under the agreement Eurotunnel will make improvements at its terminal in Folkestone, including installing new scanners and changing traffic routing to ease congestion. Andy McDonald MP, Labour's shadow transport secretary said that Mr Grayling had shown ""misjudgement"" in awarding the ferry contracts. Criticising his record, including problems on the railways, he said: ""This trail of destruction has gone on long enough. It's time for Chris Grayling to go."" By Alex Forsyth, BBC political correspondent The procurement of extra ferry services has proved highly problematic. First the fact a contract given to a firm with no ships was later cancelled, and now the decision to settle with Eurotunnel rather than face a lengthy legal fight. Critics say it shows that, despite the government's insistence that it is preparing for a possible no-deal Brexit, plans have fallen short. Others point the finger at the transport secretary himself. Labour has repeatedly called for Chris Grayling to resign, citing what the party describes as a series of failures including the introduction of a new rail timetable that led to delays and cancellations and criticism of probation reforms introduced while he was justice secretary. But while there is a chorus of criticism aimed at Mr Grayling, No 10 maintains the prime minister has confidence in him. Theresa May can ill afford further disruption in government, or to lose a loyal minister. The idea behind the extra ferry services was to raise freight capacity at ports other than Dover, in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Brittany Ferries, DFDS and Seaborne Freight were awarded contracts, worth more than Â£100m, to provide additional capacity for lorries. There was particular concern over maintaining the supply of medicines to the NHS. Speaking on Friday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""While we never give guarantees, I'm confident that, if everyone - including suppliers, freight companies, international partners, and the health and care system - does what they need to do, the supply of medicines and medical products should be uninterrupted if we leave without a deal."" A Eurotunnel spokesman said that the deal would ensure that the Channel Tunnel would be the ""preferred route"" for goods to travel between the EU and the UK. The company said the money would allow the ""development of infrastructure, security and border measures that will guarantee the flow of vehicles carrying urgent and vital goods and that will keep supply chains essential to both industry and consumers moving"". By Joe Miller, BBC business reporter It was the now notorious contract with Seaborne Freight that catapulted the government's no-deal Brexit contracts into the headlines, but it's the handling of the entire procurement process that has cost taxpayers some Â£33m. Eurotunnel argues it would have been a strong contender for a contract, having run a ferry service as recently as 2015. But the Department for Transport said the ""urgency"" of the situation forced it to hurry through the awarding of contingency planning contracts. However, had it gone to court, Eurotunnel was going to argue that the DfT had ample time for a full, public tender process, and could have foreseen all Brexit eventualities from at least the date on which Article 50 was triggered in 2017. Sources familiar with the case say the government was essentially ""held over a barrel"" by Eurotunnel, and was left with little choice but to settle. And Andrew Dean, from law firm Clifford Chance, warns this may not be the end of the matter. Mr Dean, who used to advise the government and is a procurement specialist, says:  ""If Eurotunnel were required to develop or redevelop infrastructure that delivers or supports a public function as part of this settlement, there is a risk it could be construed as another piece of public procurement without open and transparent competition. ""In which case the government would be back to square one, with other potential providers able to challenge the process.""

Pakistan frees captured Indian pilot,"This video can not be played Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman was handed over to Indian officials near a border crossing with Pakistan Pakistan has freed an Indian fighter pilot captured after his plane was shot down in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman was handed over to Indian officials on Friday at the only legal border crossing with Pakistan. Minutes earlier, the pilot said on Pakistani TV that he was ""very impressed"" by the Pakistan army. On Thursday Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan said the pilot's release was a ""peace gesture"" to India. India and Pakistan - both nuclear powers - claim all of Kashmir, but each controls only parts of it. The pilot is being hailed as a hero in India, with fireworks being set off in the capital Delhi.

In what appeared to be an edited statement aired on Pakistan TV, the wing commander described how he was shot down and rescued from an ""agitated"" crowd by Pakistani soldiers. ""The Pakistan army looked after me really well, they are very professional,"" the pilot said while in uniform, adding that he saw potential for peace. The video statement was released by Pakistan's military minutes before the pilot walked across the border On Friday evening, the pilot went through medical check-ups and was debriefed by India's military in the capital Delhi. He will be reunited with his family this weekend, officials said. Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC South Asia correspondent in Amritsar From the early hours of the morning crowds began to build at the Indian side of the Wagah border, the main crossing between India and Pakistan. Some were waving Indian flags, others had them painted on their cheeks. Today's events appear to have walked the nuclear neighbours back from the brink, but the underlying issues remain. India wants a firm commitment from Pakistan when it comes to flushing out militants on its soil - today the Pakistani foreign minister told the BBC he would act on this. But Indian officials could be sceptical - having raised these concerns before. Tensions between the two countries have escalated sharply in the past few weeks. Why India and Pakistan dispute Kashmir Khan vs Modi: Who won the war of perception? On Tuesday, India carried out air strikes on what it said was a militant camp in Pakistan in retaliation for a suicide bombing that killed at least 40 Indian troops in Indian-administered Kashmir on 14 February. A Pakistan-based group said it carried out the attack - the deadliest to take place during a three-decade insurgency against Indian rule in Kashmir. Pakistan - which denies any involvement in the 14 February attack - said it had no choice but to retaliate to the Indian raids with air strikes on Wednesday. That led to a dogfight and the Indian fighter jet being shot down in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. This video can not be played Life on both sides of the Kashmir conflict India and Pakistan have fought three wars since independence from Britain and partition in 1947. All but one were over Kashmir. Tens of thousands of troops remain positioned on either side of the border in the disputed region. The aerial attacks across the Line of Control (LoC) dividing Indian and Pakistani territory are the first since a war in 1971. At the height of the tension Pakistan closed its airspace, disrupting major air routes. Partial operations have now resumed at four main airports, with the full resumption of flights expected next week. ""As a peace gesture we are releasing the Indian pilot tomorrow,"" Mr Khan told Pakistani lawmakers in the National Assembly on Thursday. On Wednesday he pushed for talks with Delhi to prevent the risk of a ""miscalculation"" between the nuclear-armed neighbours. This video can not be played Footage appears to show wreckage from a downed Indian jet Pakistan's military spokesman said that Pakistan fighter jets had carried out ""strikes"" - exactly what they did remains unclear - in Indian-administered Kashmir on Wednesday. Two Indian air force jets then responded, crossing the de facto border that divides Kashmir. ""Our jets were ready and we shot both of them down,"" Maj Gen Asif Ghafoor said. He said that one Indian pilot was in the custody of the Pakistani army. Jubilant Indians celebrated the pilot's release in New Delhi Images then circulated of Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman's capture, which were condemned for what appeared to be a physical attack at the hands of residents in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, but also praised because of the actions of the Pakistani soldiers who intervened to create a barrier. Fighter pilot 'opened fire' before capture Pakistan's information ministry published - but subsequently deleted - a video showing the blindfolded pilot, who could be heard requesting water, just after he had been captured. In later footage, he could be seen sipping tea from a cup without a blindfold. India's foreign ministry later issued a statement demanding the release of its fighter pilot and condemning the images, describing them as a ""vulgar display of an injured personnel"".

Ferry case adds to list of Grayling mishaps,"To call Chris Grayling accident prone would be to defy the laws of probability. Put simply, no-one's that unlucky. In the case of the hapless transport secretary, there have to be other explanations - and there are. The government's no-deal Brexit planning was late in getting started. Ministers were wary of encouraging the impression that the Brexit talks could fail. Chris Grayling ran to catch up and stumbled, first awarding a ferry contract to a ferry company with no ships and ultimately no financial backing; andprovoking a lawsuit from Eurotunnel in the process. It might have happened to any minister but it happened to one with an established record of mishaps and mistakes. He was judged to bear blame for the rail timetable chaos of last summer. After first trying to dodge that blame, he admitted he hadn't asked""tough enough"" questions, and took it. It didn't help when rail season tickets leapt in cost and he was, eventually,found in the Gulf. If he thought he'd left his heavily blotted copy book behind when he switched from the Ministry of Justice to Transport, he obviously thought wrong. His book ban in prisons -ruled unlawful in the High Court- is still remembered. Andtoday's newsthat the National Audit Office has published a highly critical report on his part-privatisation of the Probation Service comes with the kind of timing which suggests Mr Grayling must, with a thoroughness his critics would find surprising, have offended the gods of every religion on Earth. Ministers make mistakes. Sometimes they're held to blame for errors for which they hold executive, but no personal, responsibility. Chris Grayling's managed to tick both boxes. Often. Today, Downing Street says the prime minister has ""full confidence"" in her transport secretary. Some Tory colleagues were surprised Mr Grayling survived Theresa May's last cabinet reshuffle. Since then, she has been rather busy. If her Brexit plan survives, and she survives long enough afterwards, and those are still quite big ""ifs"", a final decision on Chris Grayling's cabinet career looks like becoming unfinished business.

No-deal-Brexit port funding axed,"Seaborne Freight had planned to launch services from Ramsgate by Brexit day on 29 March Funding for the Port of Ramsgate which was at the centre of a row over a no-deal-Brexit ferry  contract has been axed. Thanet District Council has approved cuts of Â£730,000 saying it will no longer keep the port ""ferry-ready"". In December the government gaveSeaborne Freight a contractto run a service to Ostend, Belgium to offset delays in the case of a no-deal Brexit. TheSeaborne contract was later cancelledafter a backer pulled out. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling had faced criticism for the Â£13.8m deal with firm Seaborne Freight, which the BBC found had never run a ferry service. The Port of Ramsgate has not had a regular ferry service since 2013 Local politicians in both Ramsgate and Ostend had alsowarnedthe ports at both ends of the route would not be ready the deadline. The government is now facinglegal action from Eurotunnel, which said the contracts awarded to Seaborne and two other ferry companies were handed out in a ""secretive"" way. Could Channel Ports cope with no deal? Legal battle starts over Brexit ferry deals Brexit: A really simple guide On 7 February Mr Grayling requested Thanet District delay making a decision on its budget while talks with Seaborne continued. The budget, including the cuts to the Port of Ramsgate, was approved on Thursday. Bob Bayford, the Conservative leader of the council, said: ""The port has been held in a state of readiness for a potential ferry operator to come in, for the last five years. ""When we took control [of the council] a year ago I announced that this would be the last year we would carry on in that way, and if by the end of the year we didn't have a contracted ferry service then we would cease to keep the port ferry-ready.""

Government pays Â£33m over Brexit ferry case,"The government will pay Â£33m to Eurotunnel in an agreement to settle a lawsuit over extra ferry services in the event of a no-deal Brexit. In December, the Department for Transport (DfT) contracted three suppliers to provide additional freight capacity on ferries for lorries. But Eurotunnel said the contracts were handed out in a ""secretive"" way. As part of the agreement, Eurotunnel has agreed to make some improvements to its terminal. One of the firms awarded a ferry contract, Seaborne Freight, has already had its deal cancelled after the Irish company backing it pulled out. Shortly after it was awarded the contract, theBBC found out that Seaborne had no shipsand had never run a ferry service. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has been heavily criticised for the Seaborne deal, which would have been worth Â£13.8m. In January, Eurotunnel wrote to Mr Grayling to complain that it had not been considered when the contracts were awarded. It argued that unlike Seaborne, it has actually run a cross-Channel ferry service (MyFerryLink, which closed in 2015) and should have been approached. Ferry case adds to list of Grayling mishaps No-deal-Brexit port funding axed In a statement accompanying the agreement, Mr Grayling said: ""While it is disappointing that Eurotunnel chose to take legal action on contracts in place to ensure the smooth supply of vital medicines, I am pleased that this agreement will ensure the Channel Tunnel is ready for a post-Brexit world."" Under the agreement Eurotunnel will make improvements at its terminal in Folkestone, including installing new scanners and changing traffic routing to ease congestion. Andy McDonald MP, Labour's shadow transport secretary said that Mr Grayling had shown ""misjudgement"" in awarding the ferry contracts. Criticising his record, including problems on the railways, he said: ""This trail of destruction has gone on long enough. It's time for Chris Grayling to go."" By Alex Forsyth, BBC political correspondent The procurement of extra ferry services has proved highly problematic. First the fact a contract given to a firm with no ships was later cancelled, and now the decision to settle with Eurotunnel rather than face a lengthy legal fight. Critics say it shows that, despite the government's insistence that it is preparing for a possible no-deal Brexit, plans have fallen short. Others point the finger at the transport secretary himself. Labour has repeatedly called for Chris Grayling to resign, citing what the party describes as a series of failures including the introduction of a new rail timetable that led to delays and cancellations and criticism of probation reforms introduced while he was justice secretary. But while there is a chorus of criticism aimed at Mr Grayling, No 10 maintains the prime minister has confidence in him. Theresa May can ill afford further disruption in government, or to lose a loyal minister. The idea behind the extra ferry services was to raise freight capacity at ports other than Dover, in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Brittany Ferries, DFDS and Seaborne Freight were awarded contracts, worth more than Â£100m, to provide additional capacity for lorries. There was particular concern over maintaining the supply of medicines to the NHS. Speaking on Friday, Health Secretary Matt Hancock said: ""While we never give guarantees, I'm confident that, if everyone - including suppliers, freight companies, international partners, and the health and care system - does what they need to do, the supply of medicines and medical products should be uninterrupted if we leave without a deal."" A Eurotunnel spokesman said that the deal would ensure that the Channel Tunnel would be the ""preferred route"" for goods to travel between the EU and the UK. The company said the money would allow the ""development of infrastructure, security and border measures that will guarantee the flow of vehicles carrying urgent and vital goods and that will keep supply chains essential to both industry and consumers moving"". By Joe Miller, BBC business reporter It was the now notorious contract with Seaborne Freight that catapulted the government's no-deal Brexit contracts into the headlines, but it's the handling of the entire procurement process that has cost taxpayers some Â£33m. Eurotunnel argues it would have been a strong contender for a contract, having run a ferry service as recently as 2015. But the Department for Transport said the ""urgency"" of the situation forced it to hurry through the awarding of contingency planning contracts. However, had it gone to court, Eurotunnel was going to argue that the DfT had ample time for a full, public tender process, and could have foreseen all Brexit eventualities from at least the date on which Article 50 was triggered in 2017. Sources familiar with the case say the government was essentially ""held over a barrel"" by Eurotunnel, and was left with little choice but to settle. And Andrew Dean, from law firm Clifford Chance, warns this may not be the end of the matter. Mr Dean, who used to advise the government and is a procurement specialist, says:  ""If Eurotunnel were required to develop or redevelop infrastructure that delivers or supports a public function as part of this settlement, there is a risk it could be construed as another piece of public procurement without open and transparent competition. ""In which case the government would be back to square one, with other potential providers able to challenge the process.""

Warmbier family rebuke Trump praise of Kim,"This video can not be played Was Kim Jong-un really clueless about US student Otto Warmbier's ordeal? The family of a US student who died after he was jailed in North Korea have implicitly rebuked President Donald Trump's lauding of Kim Jong-un. Otto Warmbier's parents said they had been ""respectful"" during Mr Trump and the North Korean leader's recent summit, but were now speaking out. They said ""no excuse or lavish praise can change"" that ""Kim and his evil regime"" killed their son. Their statement came after Mr Trump heaped compliments on Mr Kim. Mr Trump's second nuclear summit with Mr Kim this week in Vietnam ended without agreement. What to make of the summit collapse? After the family's blistering statement was released, Mr Trump took to Twitter where he said he had been ""misinterpreted"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The family released a brief statement on Friday condemning praise for the North Korean leader, without mentioning Mr Trump by name. ""We have been respectful during this summit process. Now we must speak out,"" wrote Fred and Cindy Warmbier. Fred and Cindy Warmbier were guests at Mr Trump's 2018 State of the Union speech ""Kim and his evil regime are responsible for the death of our son Otto. ""Kim and his evil regime are responsible for unimaginable cruelty and inhumanity. ""No excuse or lavish praise can change that."" Warmbier was jailed in Pyongyang in January 2016 during an organised tour, accused of stealing a hotel poster. The University of Virginia student was sentenced to 15 years' hard labour, but released after 17 months. The 22-year-old was returned to the US in a vegetative state in June 2017, and died days later in his hometown of Cincinnati, Ohio. The Warmbiers attended the 2018 State of the Union speech as the president's guests, weeping as he called them ""powerful witnesses to a menace that threatens our world"". What didTrump sayabout Kim? Mr Trump told reporters in Hanoi on Thursday morning, referring to Mr Warmbier's death: ""He [Mr Kim] tells me he didn't know about it, and I will take him at his word."" The president added that the North Korean leader felt ""very badly"" about the case. In a Fox News interview aired late on Thursday, Mr Trump said Mr Kim was ""sharp as you can be"" and ""a real leader"". ""Some people say I shouldn't like him,"" the US president told host Sean Hannity, a vocal Trump advocate. ""Why shouldn't I like him?"" The president - who is now back at the White House - said he gets along ""really well"" with Mr Kim. Trump defends Kim over US student's death ""And he's a real personality and he's very smart. He's sharp as you can be, and he's a real leader, and he's pretty mercurial. ""I don't say that necessarily in a bad way, but he's a pretty mercurial guy."" Explaining why the summit broke down, Mr Trump said: ""Well, they wanted to denuke certain areas and I wanted everything."" The Fox host defended the president's decision to walk away, recommending a reading of Mr Trump's book, The Art of the Deal, to truly ""understand"" his tactics. Kim's hiding sister and other unreal moments North Korea in nine charts Yongbyon: The heart of NK's nuclear programme This video can not be played BBC's Laura Bicker explains why Trump is the 'biggest loser' from the summit After the talks broke down, North Korean officials contradicted Mr Trump's contention that a sticking point was Pyongyang's demand for total sanctions relief. Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho said the nation had only asked for partial sanctions relief in exchange for disabling its main nuclear complex at Yongbyon and permanently halting nuclear and long-range rocket testing. ""This proposal was the biggest denuclearisation measure we could take at the present stage when taking into consideration the current level of confidence between the DPRK [North Korea] and the United States,"" said Mr Ri. North Korea's state-run media struck an upbeat tone on Friday, without mentioning that the summit had ended early. News agency KCNA said the two leaders had promised to remain in touch in order to continue the ""epochal development"" of bilateral relations and the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula. ""The top leaders of the two countries highly appreciated at the one-on-one talks and extended talks that a remarkable progress has been made in the historic course of implementing the Singapore joint statement,"" said KCNA. This video can not be played The moment Kim Jong-un answered a question from a foreign reporter On Friday, Mr Trump tweeted: ""I never like being misinterpreted, but especially when it comes to Otto Warmbier and his great family."" He said that Warmbier and his family ""have become a tremendous symbol of strong passion and strength, which will last for many years into the future"". ""I love Otto and think of him often!"" he added. It comes after Democrats led criticism of the president, pointing out that Mr Trump has previously sided with strongmen. After meeting Russian President Vladimir Putin in Helsinki in July 2018,the US president said he believed his denialthat the Kremlin sought to interfere in the 2016 US election, despite US intelligence officials concluding otherwise. Critics also pointed out that last December, Mr Trump defended Saudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman despite CIA officials' belief that the royal had ordered the gruesome murder of a US-based reporter, Jamal Khashoggi. Later on Friday, White House aide Kellyanne Conway said Mr Trump ""agrees with the Warmbier family and holds North Korea responsible"" for their son's death. ""He has deep affection and shares the grief with the Warmbier family,"" she told Fox News. ""What the president is saying is that there's no indication Chairman Kim knew what happened to Otto Warmbier when it happened,"" she added. By BBC Monitoring Russian state-controlled media - once quite the fans of Donald Trump - were scathing about the US president's performance at the talks. A Channel One report from the summit said it had ""failed miserably, dealing another blow to the reputation of the American leader"". Over on Rossiya 1 TV, a presenter said the outcome was ""predictable"", as Mr Trump had ""arrived at the new summit with old tactics"", while NTV pointed out that Russia had warned Washington's ""position of ultimatums"" would not work. One Rossiya 1 presenter suggested Mr Trump had only been interested in distracting people from thetestimony of his former lawyer, Michael Cohen. In the papers, the independentNovaya Gazeta,externallooks on the bright side, saying that the leaders - while ""still extremely far from the Nobel Peace Prize"" - have at least stopped swapping insults. But in mass tabloidMoskovsky Komsomolets,external, one pundit is withering, saying one ""has to understand the core of a subject to make compromises, while Trump is the most ignorant head of state in US history"".

Boyfriend jailed for Bestival drugs death,"Ceon Broughton was found guilty of manslaughter and supplying the Class A drug 2CP A man who gave his girlfriend drugs at a festival and filmed her as she died has been jailed for her manslaughter. Louella Fletcher-Michie, the daughter of Holby City actor John Michie, was found dead in woodland near the Bestival site in Dorset after taking the drug 2CP. Ceon Broughton was found guilty of manslaughter and supplying the Class A drug by unanimous verdict on Thursday. He has been sentenced to eight-and-a-half years in prison. Ms Fletcher-Michie's mother, Carol, said losing Louella was ""like losing a limb"" Mr Michie said in a victim impact statement: ""I wake up every morning to face life starting again without Louella, our daughter, our sister, our friend, our family now broken. ""And for what? It makes no sense - our beautiful Louella should still be with us on any measure of humanity. ""No more yoga with my daughter, no more running around the outside of the Arsenal stadium with my daughter. ""Her life cruelly cut short. Our lives forever diminished. She was wise beyond her years and trusting, too trusting it seems."" This video can not be played In footage shown to jurors by the defence, Louella Fletcher-Michie was filmed playing with fairy lights in a tent at the festival Mother Carol Fletcher said: ""On the outside we all look much the same as we did before, but inside our hearts and souls have been ripped out, trampled on and stuffed back in. ""Like losing a limb, waking up every day to face this new reality, having to learn to live with this for the rest of our lives. ""There are no winners. We don't think Ceon is evil. He was stupid, massively selfish and he lied. My hope is that he has learned that truth is all we have ever really got."" Mr Michie shouted ""evil, evil"" and ""not even sorry"" at Broughton during an angry exchange at court during the trial Sister Daisy Fletch-Michie said: ""Every single day I try to understand why Ceon didn't help Louella, the hours that passed with her getting progressively worse, even having spoken to him on the phone myself, and begging him to get her to a medical tent. Why didn't he?"" In sentencing Broughton, Judge Justice Goose said: ""I have come to the clear conclusion you were only concerned for yourself. ""You had created an obviously dangerous situation, you were not concerned until it was too late. ""Whilst you were doing little to help Louella you were sending messages to a friend asking him to say that Louella had obtained the drugs from an unknown person. You were more concerned to create a defence."" Ceon Broughton could be seen laughing and smiling during a 50-minute video previously shown to the jury Broughton, 30, of Island Centre Way, Enfield, London, did little to help his yoga teacher girlfriend for six hours as he feared breaching a suspended jail term, his trial at Winchester Crown Court heard. The jury was told the couple liked to film each other when they were taking drugs. Broughton - a rapper known as CeonRPG who has worked with artists including Skepta - filmed Ms Fletcher-Michie, 24, as she became ""disturbed, agitated, and then seriously ill"". He also branded her a ""drama queen"" as she lay dying on 11 September 2017. Killer daughter 'posed no risk' to mum Rucksack heart woman dies after transplant Peer charged with attempted rapes of girl The little-known drugs causing family devastation Jurors heard Broughton failed to act because he had been handed a 24-week prison sentence, suspended for one year, a month before. He had already pleaded guilty to supplying 2CP to Ms Fletcher-Michie and her friend at Glastonbury Festival in 2017. The trial heard the pair had gone into woodland to take drugs on the eve of Ms Fletcher-Michie's 25th birthday but Broughton had ""bumped up"" his girlfriend's dose. She was found dead by a security steward 400m from the festival's hospital tent. The jury was told he had contacted friends and Ms Fletcher-Michie's family, sending them maps showing his location. Ms Fletcher-Michie was found dead by a security steward 400m from the festival's hospital tent At court on 21 February, Broughton broke a table and damaged a water cooler during an angry exchange with Ms Fletcher-Michie's father. Mr Michie had shouted ""evil, evil"" and ""not even sorry"" as his family walked towards an exit. Stephen Kamlish QC read a statement to the court from his client, Broughton, saying: ""Sorry I didn't do more to save Louella, sorry for the suffering I caused to everyone who loved Louella, I want to make things right."" Following Broughton's conviction, John Michie said: ""Ceon's life sentence is knowing that he didn't help Louella to live"" Senior investigating officer Neil Devoto, of Dorset Police, described Ms Fletcher-Michie's death as ""tragic and needless"". Of Broughton's actions on the night she died, he said: ""All he needed to do was walk a few hundred metres to the on-site hospital and medical staff, and call for emergency help or dial 999 on his mobile. ""He supplied Louella with the drug and had a duty of care. His actions were selfish and shameful.""

Salisbury declared free of Novichok,"Military personnel have spent 13,000 hours on the clean-up following the nerve agent poisoning in March 2018 Salisbury has been declared free from the nerve agent Novichok almost a year after the Sergei Skripal poisoning. The former Russian spy's house and 11 other potentially contaminated sites were ruled safe on Friday. Deputy assistant commissioner Dean Haydon said: ""I am conscious someone may have information but is worried about telling us a year on."" Military personnel spent 13,000 hours on the clean-up after the nerve agent attack on 4 March 2018. Mr Skripal and his daughter Yulia were targeted in the Novichok attack and Army Lt Gen Ty Urch said it had been ""the longest running"" operation of its kind on British soil. An estimated 600 to 800 specially trained military personnel, including the chemical, biological, radiological and nuclear regiment, were involved in the clean-up. This video can not be played Laura Foster explains how the Novichok nerve agent works The operation included taking thousands of test samples from across Salisbury and nearby Amesbury, where Dawn Sturgess, 44, was fatally poisoned in July. Mr Haydon, who is the senior national coordinator for counter terrorism policing, added: ""I am urging anyone who has information that they have not yet passed on to police to do so. Please do not worry - just call or email us. The information you have could be crucial to securing the prosecution of those responsible for Dawn Sturgess' death."" Along with the Skripals' house, in Christie Miller Road, the sites included the area around a park bench where the Skripals were found collapsed, the Zizzi restaurant where they had dined beforehand, and the home of Det Sgt Nick Bailey, who was exposed to the agent. Other sites included Salisbury and Amesbury ambulance stations, Bourne Hill police station, Ashley Wood vehicle recovery yard and The Mill pub. Sergei Skripal and his daughter Yulia survived the attack in Salisbury last March A Defra spokesman said: ""The completion of clean-up work at Christie Miller Road, Salisbury marks a significant milestone in south Wiltshire's return to normality."" Alistair Cunningham, from the South Wiltshire recovery coordinating group, said it was a ""significant moment"" for the area. He added: ""Work will begin shortly to reconstruct and refurbish the [Skripals' house] so it can return to being a home again. ""We are continuing to talk to the residents on the future of the property as it is important their views are taken into account."" Environment minister Therese Coffey said the ""professionalism"" of all those involved in the clean-up had been ""exemplary"". The 355-day operation also included the Amesbury home of Ms Sturgess' partner Charlie Rowley, 45, who survived after being exposed to the nerve agent. A Boots pharmacy branch, Amesbury Baptist Church and ambulances used in the initial response also had to be decontaminated. Lt Gen Urch, who oversaw military involvement in the clean-up, said the ""slow, deliberate and detailed"" operation had been ""an amazing demonstration of physical and mental courage"". ""Novichok is probably one of the most dangerous and most challenging chemicals in existence today and you don't need very much of it and it's highly spreadable,"" he said. ""I think our military personnel have demonstrated genuine courage."" He added that the teams involved in the clean-up would be ""recognised in due course for their courage"".

How could Brexit be delayed?,"The European Union (EU) has accepted the UK's request for a Brexit delay until 31 January 2020, with an option to leave sooner if a deal is approved by Parliament. Delaying the UK's exit date requires an extension to Article 50, the part of the Lisbon Treaty that sets out what happens when a country decides it wants to leave the EU. Article 50 allows an initial two-year period for negotiations on the terms of exiting. It was triggered by then Prime Minister Theresa May on 29 March 2017, giving an exit date of 29 March 2019. But this date was extended twice, first to 12 April and then until 31 October, after Mrs May's deal was rejected in successive votes in the House of Commons. Now it is being extended for a third time - so how does this process work? The UK cannot make a decision about extending Article 50 on its own - it has to send a request to the 27 other EU countries. All 27 have to agree in order to secure an extension. On Saturday 19 October, Mr Johnson sent a letter, as he was compelled to by alaw known as the Benn Act. The law stated he must send an extension request should he fail to get a Brexit deal through the House of Commons by the end of 19 October. Mr Johnson also sent a second letter saying he believed that a ""further extension would damage the interests of the UK and our EU partners"". Nevertheless, on 28 October the EU agreed to the extension proposed in his first letter. The EU was not obliged to say yes. Once it received the UK's delay request, in the form of a letter, the 27 leaders consulted with each other on their decision. It was then made following a meeting of EU ambassadors in Brussels. If EU leaders had decided to offer a longer extension they would have been likely to have met in person to set conditions of the extension. It's worth pointing out that Article 50 can also be revoked - effectively cancelling Brexit. The UK can in theory do that without consulting anyone else. That would mean that Brexit would not happen and the UK would remain in the EU on the same terms it has now. The Liberal Democrats are the only party to say that would they would revoke Article 50 without a referendum if they won a majority in a general election. The European Court of Justice (ECJ) has ruled that a revocation should be ""unequivocal and unconditional"", suggesting that the ECJ would take a dim view of any attempt to withdraw an Article 50 notification and then resubmit it again a short time later.

Instagram 'biggest for child grooming online',"Sex offenders are grooming children on Instagram more than on any other online platform, a charity has found. Police in England and Wales recorded 1,944 incidents of sexual communication with children in the six months to September 2018, the NSPCC said. Instagram was used in 32% of the 1,317 cases where a method was recorded, Facebook in 23% and Snapchat in 14%. Instagram and Facebook said they ""aggressively"" fought grooming, while Snapchat said it was ""unacceptable"". Following pressure from campaigners,sexual communication with a child,externalbecame an offence in April 2017. In the 18 months that followed, more than 5,000 online grooming offences were recorded by police, according to the data gathered by the NSPCC. How can I keep my kids safe online? The charity said the figures did not ""fully reflect the scale of the issue"", as many crimes went undetected or unreported. Where the police logged age and gender, seven out of 10 victims were girls aged 12 to 15. One in five was aged 11 or under. The youngest victim was five years old. The NSPCC said 39 of the 43 police forces in England and Wales responded to Freedom of Information requests, with only Surrey, Sussex, Northampton and City of London police failing to provide data. The children's charity is calling for new laws to force social media firms to do more to protect children. In one case of abuse given by the charity, a girl was groomed by a 24-year-old man when she was 13. Emily - not her real name - met the man through a friend. He had introduced himself, saying he was 16, which quickly changed to 18. She told him she was 13. Later that evening he added her on Facebook and Snapchat. Emily said: ""It escalated very quickly from there. We exchanged texts which quickly became sexual, then photos and videos before arranging for him to come and pick me up after school. ""He drove me somewhere quietâ¦ and took me into the woods and had sex with me. He drove me in the direction of home straight afterwards, refusing to even talk, and then kicked me out of the car at the traffic lights. ""I was bleeding and crying. This was my first sexual experience."" Emily's mother said: ""We felt as though we had failed as parents - we knew about these social media sites, we thought we were doing everything we could to ensure our children's safety when they were online, but we still couldn't protect Emily."" NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless accused social media networks of ""10 years of failed self-regulation"". ""These figures are overwhelming evidence that keeping children safe cannot be left to social networks. We cannot wait for the next tragedy before tech companies are made to act,"" he said. CBBC's 8 top tips for staying safe online Ahead of the government publishing a delayed white paper on online harm, the charity is pushing for statutory regulation to enforce a legal duty of care to children on social networks, with a penalty of substantial fines if they fail. A National Crime Agency spokesperson said: ""It is vital that online platforms used by children and young people have in place robust mechanisms and processes to prevent, identify and report sexual exploitation and abuse, including online grooming. ""Children and young people also need easy access to mechanisms allowing them to alert platforms to potential offending. A spokesperson for Facebook, which also owns Instagram, said keeping young people safe was its ""top priority. ""We use advanced technology and work closely with the police and CEOP [Child Exploitation and Online Protection] to aggressively fight this type of content and protect young people."" Dating apps 'must not risk child safety' Fortnite predator 'groomed children in-game' Train firm in overcrowding pledge,external A Snapchat spokesperson said the exploitation of any member of its community, especially a young person, was ""absolutely unacceptable"". ""We go to great lengths to prevent and respond to this type of illegal activity on our platform,"" they added. The platform recommends young people keep their privacy settings restricted, do not share their username publicly and do not add people they do not know as friends. A spokesperson from the Home Office said both the home secretary and culture secretary had ""engaged tech firms about their responsibilities towards protecting people"". Last year the home secretary announced a Â£250,000""innovation call"",externalfor organisations to help develop new ways to disrupt the live streaming of abuse.

Crowds gather for Indian pilot's release,"Pakistan says Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman is being treated well Crowds of Indians have gathered near a border crossing with Pakistan ahead of the release of an Indian fighter pilot captured by Pakistan. Pakistan's Prime Minister Imran Khan said the pilot would be released as a ""peace gesture"" on Friday. India's military welcomed the move. Wing Commander Abhinandan Varthaman's plane was shot down in the disputed region of Kashmir on Wednesday. Both countries are under international pressure to calm tensions. On Friday Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the events of the past few days had ""brought our nation closer"". Why India and Pakistan dispute Kashmir Who is captured Indian pilot Abhinandan? Khan vs Modi: Who won the war of perception? ""The way the nation has supported our armed forces is extraordinary and I bow to every Indian for that,"" he said. On Thursday Mr Khan repeated his call for the de-escalation of the situation, saying that Pakistan and India ""have to live in peace"". He has also pushed for talks with Delhi. Wing Commander Abhinandan was shot down in a dogfight between Indian and Pakistani jets after Pakistani air strikes on Indian-controlled territory on Wednesday. Pakistan's information ministry tweeted a video showing the captured Indian pilot Images then circulated of his capture, which were both condemned for what appeared to be a physical attack at the hands of residents in Pakistan-controlled Kashmir, and praised for the actions of the Pakistani soldiers who intervened to protect him. Villagers recount dramatic capture of pilot Pakistan's information ministry published - but subsequently deleted - a video showing the blindfolded pilot, who could be heard requesting water, just after he had been captured. This video can not be played Footage appears to show wreckage from a downed Indian jet Villagers in Horran threw stones at the pilot, who fired several warning shots in response, eyewitnesses later told the BBC. He is being hailed as a hero in India. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

On Tuesday,India struck what it said was a militant camp in Pakistanin retaliation for a suicide bombing that killed at least 40 Indian troops in Kashmir on 14 February. A Pakistan-based group said it carried out the attack - the deadliest to take place during a three-decade insurgency against Indian rule in Kashmir. Pakistan - which denies any involvement in the 14 February attack - said it had no choice but to retaliate to the Indian raids with air strikes on Wednesday. That led to a dogfight and the Indian fighter jet being shot down in Pakistan-administered Kashmir. Enthusiastic supporters awaited the pilot's return Tens of thousands of troops remain positioned on either side of the border in the disputed region. On Friday, four Indian security personnel were killed and eight others injured in a raid on militants in India-administered Kashmir. At the height of the tension Pakistan closed its airspace, disrupting major air routes. Flight operations partially resumed on Friday and will reopen fully on Monday, the country's civil aviation authority said. The sequence of events over the last few days have rapidly shifted from being seen as a boost for the ruling Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) ahead of upcoming parliamentary elections, to a general feeling of disenchantment over the way things have turned out. On Wednesday evening, when news of the captured pilot dominated headlines, India's opposition parties issued a statement in which they attacked the ruling BJP for ""blatant politicisation of the armed forces' sacrifices"". In a series of tweets, India's finance minister Arun Jaitley hit back, saying the joint statement was ""being used by Pakistan to bolster its case"". Allow Twitter content?

Nine dates, including two at London's Royal Albert Hall, have been scrapped. Several fans had already sought refunds, saying they could no longer support the artist. ""Full refunds to ticket purchasers will be processed by end of day on Monday,""said Ticketmaster in a tweet announcing the news,external. The cancellation comes two weeks after the New York Times published a report containing allegations that Adams had exchanged sexually inappropriate messages with a teenage girl. Adams' lawyer said the star ""unequivocally denies"" engaging in inappropriate communications with someone he knew was underage. The FBI later said it would investigate the texts to determine whether Adams was aware of her age. The New York Times story also contained interviews with several women who said Adams had offered them help with their careers as a pretext for sex, and allegations of psychological abuse from the musician's former wife, Mandy Moore. Adams' initial response was to threaten legal action, in a tweet that said the newspaper was ""going down"".

"ÃÂ£7,500 tuition fees plan faces Brexit delay","The review of university tuition fees in England has been caught in a Brexit gridlock - and might be delayed until May or later, according to sources. The government-commissioned review of student finance is expected to call for a cut in fees, with the figure of Â£7,500 now being floated. The review will send a tough message to universities about value for money. But further education and skills are expected to be given much more support, including easier access to loans. University leaders are braced for a recommendation to cut fees from the review chaired by Philip Augar, with private expectations that the current Â£9,250 will be cut to about Â£7,500, rather than the Â£6,500 first suggested. But it seems increasingly likely that the all-consuming politics and economic uncertainty of Brexit have pushed back the review. There are also claims of significant differences in what 10 Downing Street, the Treasury and the Department for Education want from the shake-up of fees. According to sources, a headline cut in fees is seen as important for the prime minister's office - described as being the ""retail offer"" needed to respond to Labour in a general election. If fees go down I'll go to university: What teenagers want from fees review. Biggest winners and losers from degree courses Former education secretary Justine Greening wanted to scrap fees Universities are anxious about whether any cut in fees will be fully replaced by direct funding - and this, according to sources, is part of the Brexit-related delay. Theresa May commissioned the review to find better value for money for students The Treasury does not want to commit to extra direct funding while there is such uncertainty about future public finances. But at the same time, the Department for Education is reluctant to go ahead with a cut in students' fees until it is clear how that income could be replaced. The debate is said to be ""stuck on the roundabout"" - and even when the Augar review publishes its findings, there could be delays before the government responds with any decision. This might not be until the autumn or later - in a political calendar full of uncertainties about budgets, elections and leaders. However, other senior university figures say the prime minister might want to push ahead with changing fees as soon as Brexit has been achieved, as a way of showing the government still has a grip on domestic policy. There are suggestions that the DfE has been fighting a rearguard action over reducing fees - against more sceptical voices who want to put pressure on what they see as expensive fees, expensive vice-chancellors and low-value courses. This weekEducation Secretary Damian Hinds spoke in defence of the current fees system, saying there was no evidence it deterred disadvantaged youngsters. But universities are expecting this to be a challenging review for them, which will want to rebalance funding and political focus towards further education, adult education and vocational skills. This is likely to mean more financial support for further education colleges and access to loans for vocational students, with more funding expected through the spending review if not the Augar review process. The aim is to make technical education a much more attractive option. But Dr Tim Bradshaw, chief executive of the Russell Group of universities, said: ""It is high time colleges received proper support, but it makes no sense to do this by punishing university students. ""Why take aim at a national asset? Diminishing our higher education sector through reduced funding would be an act of self-harm."" Universities seem likely to face tough questions about value for money and whether students should be funded to study courses which give them low financial returns. Ideas have been floated for limiting student numbers - such as not allowing grants for students below three D grades. But this suggestion, considered and discarded by the previous fees review a decade ago, would raise accusations of adversely affecting new universities, some with already fragile finances, who are doing the most work in social mobility. There could be more scrutiny of university spending on widening access to disadvantaged groups, currently costing Â£860m per year, with suggestions of a more centralised approach. Another big factor influencing the review is the accounting decision of the Office for National Statistics to addÂ£12bn of the cost of student finance to the deficit. This is said to have forcefully ""concentrated minds"" on the real cost of fees and loans. The return of maintenance grants for students from low-income families is also under consideration - and there has been pressure for a reduction in interest charges on loan repayments. There are also arguments that when the review is so strongly linked to Theresa May, any change at the top could see it disappearing into the long grass. Charles Heymann, a higher education consultant who formerly worked at the DfE, says: ""It wouldn't be the first education review to end up gathering dust on Whitehall shelves. ""Brexit means ministers have limited political bandwidth, legislative space or civil service capacity to push any major new domestic programme. ""The final report will no doubt be well-evidenced, well-argued and compelling - but it's at the mercy of political forces well beyond its control. It's just not clear whether it will form the basis of radical, long-term tertiary education reform or whether it is dead on arrival.""

US offers $1m reward for Bin Laden's son,"Hamza Bin Laden's whereabouts are not known The United States is offering a reward of up to $1m (Â£750,000) for information about one of the sons of the late al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden. Hamza Bin Laden is emerging as a leader of the Islamist militant group, officials say. He is thought to be based near the Afghan-Pakistani border. In recent years, he has released audio and video messages calling on followers to attack the US and its Western allies in revenge for his father's killing. In 2011, US special forces killed Osama Bin Laden in a compound in Abbottabad, Pakistan. He approved the attacks on the US on 11 September 2001, in which nearly 3,000 people were killed. On Friday, Saudi Arabia's interior ministry announced it had stripped Hamza Bin Laden of his citizenship. In March 2018, he appeared in an audio message urging citizens of Saudi Arabia to prepare for jihad against their monarchs. Hamza Bin Laden, who is believed to be about 30 years old, was officially designated by the US as a global terrorist two years ago. The US state department sayshe married the daughter of Mohammed Atta,,externalwho hijacked one of the four commercial aircraft used in the 2001 attacks, and crashed it into one of the World Trade Center towers in New York.

Letters from Osama Bin Laden seized from his compound indicated that he had been grooming Hamza, thought to be his favourite son, to replace him as leader of al-Qaeda. Hamza Bin Laden is believed to have spent years with his mother inIran, where it is thought his wedding took place, while other reports suggest he may have lived in Pakistan, Afghanistan or Syria. This video can not be played Footage showing Hamza's wedding was made public by the CIA in 2017 ""We do believe he's probably in the Afghan-Pakistan border [sic] and... he'll cross into Iran. But he could be anywhere though in... south central Asia,"" said Assistant Secretary for Diplomatic Security Michael Evanoff. Hamza Bin Laden 'issues al-Qaeda message' How lives of Osama Bin Laden's neighbours changed forever Analysis by Frank Gardner, BBC Security Correspondent US counter-terrorism officials have been growing increasingly concerned that Hamza Bin Laden could emerge as a charismatic leader of a revitalised al-Qaeda. After the killing of Hamza's father, Osama, by US Navy Seal commandos in Pakistan in 2011, al-Qaeda was largely eclipsed by its even more fanatical rival, the Islamic State group (IS). The nominal al-Qaeda leader, Ayman al-Zawahiri, is a dull, bespectacled Egyptian strategist who has failed to inspire. But western intelligence figures, including MI6 chief Alex Younger, warn that al-Qaeda has not gone away. It has used its recent low profile to rebuild and reorganise, planning more attacks on the West and its allied governments across the Middle East and Africa. Al-Qaeda always said it was a mistake for IS to declare a physical caliphate which could then be attacked by a US-led coalition. They were proved right and now both organisations present an ongoing threat of terrorist attacks. Osama Bin Laden near Kabul in 2001 Emerged in Afghanistan in the late 1980s, as Arab volunteers joined US-backed Afghan mujahideen fighting to expel the occupying Soviet forces Osama Bin Laden set up an organisation to help the volunteers, which became known as al-Qaeda, or ""the base"" He left Afghanistan in 1989, returning in 1996 to run military training camps for thousands of foreign Muslims Al-Qaeda declared ""holy war"" on Americans, Jews and their allies The US-led war in Afghanistan following the 2001 attacks toppled the Taliban regime which had given Osama Bin Laden and his group sanctuary. In recent years, al-Qaeda was overshadowed by IS, which attracted global attention, fighters and funds, and carried out a number of attacks on Western targets and allies. ""Al-Qaeda during this period has been relatively quiet, but that is a strategic pause, not a surrender,"" said US Co-ordinator for Counter-terrorism Nathan Sales. ""Today's al-Qaeda is not stagnant. It's rebuilding and it continues to threaten the United States and its allies.... Make no mistake, al-Qaeda retains both the capability and the intent to hit us."" Where is al-Qaeda today?

Numbers returning to prison 'skyrocket',"Problems with the partial privatisation of the probation system in England and Wales have cost taxpayers almost Â£500m, the government spending watchdog says. Under the changes, which began in 2013, firms were given contracts to supervise low and medium-risk offenders. The National Audit Office said reforms were ""rushed"" and the numbers returning to prison for breaching their licence conditions had since ""skyrocketed"". The government said this was because more offenders were being monitored. Prior to the reforms, which were designed to drive down re-offending rates, convicts who had served less than one year did not have to be supervised by probation services. But from 2015 every criminal given a custodial sentence became subject to statutory supervision and rehabilitation upon release into the community. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said this meant an extra 40,000 offenders were being supported each year. The NAO report said that between January 2015 and September 2018, the number of offenders recalled to prison for breaching their licence condition increased by almost half, from 4,240 to 6,240. Over the same period, the percentage of offenders recalled to custody who had received sentences of less than 12 months increased from 3% to 36%. Private probation contracts to end early Probation system 'a mess', say MPs Prisoners 'lack support after release' The NAO said the MoJ had ""set itself up to fail"" after it used a payment-by-results model which was ""inappropriate"" for probation services. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said the ""scathing"" report raised ""serious questions about decision-making at the Ministry of Justice"". In 2013 the MoJ began a major reform of probation services, partially privatising it in England and Wales. It involved 21 companies - known as community rehabilitation companies (CRCs) - monitoring people who had been released from jail after serving short sentences. But the report says the MoJ designed and implemented its reforms too quickly. By March 2018, the CRCs were facing losses of Â£294m over the lifetime of their contracts - compared with the profits of Â£269m they had been expecting to start with. Four months later, the government acknowledged that the quality of probation services being delivered was not good enough and announced the MoJ would end the contracts with the CRCs in 2020 - 14 months early. The report estimates that additional payments to CRCs beyond the original terms of the contracts will cost the department Â£296m, and terminating the contracts early will cost at least Â£171m. The full cost to the taxpayer will not be known until at least December 2020, the report says. It concludes that the MoJ's contracts were ""ineffective"" and hampered its ability to hold providers to account for poor services. Overall, it noted ""little progress"" had been made on transforming probation services. Rory Stewart, prisons and probation minister, said the performance of CRCs was ""too often deeply disappointing"". ""That is why we have stepped in to end contracts early and invested an extra Â£22m a year in services for offenders on release,"" he said. Meg Hillier, who chairs the Commons Public Accounts Committee which scrutinises the value for money of public spending, said the MoJ's ""botched contracting"" had left this ""essential service"" underfunded. ""The ministry now needs to reflect and ensure that its new proposals can deliver the much-needed improvements to probation services,"" she added. Katie Lomas, chair of the probation officers union Napo, said bringing in providers with no experience in probation and splitting the service into two separate organisations was always going to bring additional costs. She told the BBC that the government should ""pause and reflect"" before enacting further reforms to ensure the same mistakes were not repeated. The chief inspector of probation, Dame Glenys Stacey, welcomed the NAO report, for bringing ""greater transparency"" to probation funding and contracts.

There are suggestions that the DfE has been fighting a rearguard action over reducing fees - against more sceptical voices who want to put pressure on what they see as expensive fees, expensive vice-chancellors and low-value courses. This weekEducation Secretary Damian Hinds spoke in defence of the current fees system, saying there was no evidence it deterred disadvantaged youngsters. But universities are expecting this to be a challenging review for them, which will want to rebalance funding and political focus towards further education, adult education and vocational skills. This is likely to mean more financial support for further education colleges and access to loans for vocational students, with more funding expected through the spending review if not the Augar review process. The aim is to make technical education a much more attractive option. But Dr Tim Bradshaw, chief executive of the Russell Group of universities, said: ""It is high time colleges received proper support, but it makes no sense to do this by punishing university students. ""Why take aim at a national asset? Diminishing our higher education sector through reduced funding would be an act of self-harm."" Universities seem likely to face tough questions about value for money and whether students should be funded to study courses which give them low financial returns. Ideas have been floated for limiting student numbers - such as not allowing grants for students below three D grades. But this suggestion, considered and discarded by the previous fees review a decade ago, would raise accusations of adversely affecting new universities, some with already fragile finances, who are doing the most work in social mobility. There could be more scrutiny of university spending on widening access to disadvantaged groups, currently costing Â£860m per year, with suggestions of a more centralised approach. Another big factor influencing the review is the accounting decision of the Office for National Statistics to addÂ£12bn of the cost of student finance to the deficit. This is said to have forcefully ""concentrated minds"" on the real cost of fees and loans. The return of maintenance grants for students from low-income families is also under consideration - and there has been pressure for a reduction in interest charges on loan repayments. There are also arguments that when the review is so strongly linked to Theresa May, any change at the top could see it disappearing into the long grass. Charles Heymann, a higher education consultant who formerly worked at the DfE, says: ""It wouldn't be the first education review to end up gathering dust on Whitehall shelves. ""Brexit means ministers have limited political bandwidth, legislative space or civil service capacity to push any major new domestic programme. ""The final report will no doubt be well-evidenced, well-argued and compelling - but it's at the mercy of political forces well beyond its control. It's just not clear whether it will form the basis of radical, long-term tertiary education reform or whether it is dead on arrival.""

What will happen to the EHIC?,"If you are planning a holiday in a country in the European Union (EU), you might be wondering whether your European Health Insurance Card (EHIC) will still be valid. As part of the deal announced on 24 December 2020, the UK and the EU agreed that the cards can still be used until their expiry dates. After that, the government will issuea new Global Heath Insurance Card(GHIC) which will replace the EHIC for the majority of UK citizens. What is an EHIC? The EHIC currently entitles you to state-provided medical treatment if you fall ill or have an accident in any EU country, or in Switzerland, Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein, where the scheme also applies. The same applies to EU citizens who are in the UK. The cards cover pre-existing medical conditions and routine maternity care, as well as emergency care. Individuals with chronic illnesses, for example those who require dialysis, can travel knowing they will receive treatment on the same terms as the citizens of the country they are visiting. The UK has issued27 million EHIC cards.,external The cards are valid until they expire. They last five years and the expiry date is printed on the front. You can no longer apply for a new EHIC. If your EHIC has expired (or is about to), you should apply for its replacement -the new UK GHIC,external. It will cover chronic or existing illnesses and routine maternity care as well as emergencies, but treatments such as dialysis or chemotherapy will have to be pre-arranged to ensure they are available at your destination. The GHIC will not be valid in Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein or Switzerland. The government website says that the GHIC is not an alternative to travel insurance. It advises that you should also buy travel insurance which includes health cover as the GHIC  - like the EHIC - does not cover any private medical healthcare such as mountain rescue in ski resorts or being flown back to the UK. The easiest was to get one is by usingthe GHIC online application form,external. You should apply about two weeks before your EHIC expires, as the new card usually arrives within 10 days, according to the government website. UK students who are planning to study in an EU country won't be able to use the online application. They'll have to send theirapplication by post,external, together with a letter from their UK university, in order to apply for a GHIC that's time limited to the length of their course. You will also have to apply by post if you are not a British or Irish citizen, and must attach your visa or residence permit. EU nationals (as well as citizens of Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland) who were living in the UK before the end of 2020, will be able to continue using the NHS for their healthcare while resident here. They are also entitled to apply fora new UK-issued EHIC card,external. Their new EHIC will be valid in the EU along with Norway, Iceland, Liechtenstein and Switzerland. An estimated 3.7 million EU nationals lived in the UK in 2019,external, making up 5.6% of the UK population. UK state pensioners who were in the EU before the end of 2020, UK students who had started a course in an EU country before then and so-called ""frontier workers"" (people who work in one state and live in another) will all also be able to apply for a new UK-issued EHIC card. Their rights are guaranteed by the UK-EU withdrawal agreement, which iswritten into UK law. The same agreement guarantees the rights of UK nationals who were resident in the EU before the end of 2020. They will be able to continue using their EU-issued EHIC card when travelling within the EU. The UK hasreciprocal health deals,externalwith a few non-EU countries, including Australia and New Zealand, under which visitors can receive urgent treatment at a reduced cost or for free. In other words, visitors are treated as if they are resident of the country in question. But unlike the EHIC, the agreements do not cover pre-existing conditions.

Brexit plan to increase vet inspectors,"The Irish government isadvertising a 4m euro (Â£3.4m) contract,externalto recruit vets to carry out animal inspections in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Northern Ireland has already recruited additional vets and says further appointments are planned. It remains unclear whether any checks could take place at the Irish border. But EU law says animal products (including livestock) have to be inspected at the point they enter the single market. ""We could see a surge in demand for border checks on animals and animal products,"" says Aurelie Moralis, president of the Northern Ireland branch of the British Veterinary Association. Brexit: What is the no-deal WTO option? If extra vets are needed, they are likely to be deployed at Dublin and Rosslare Ports, according to a statement sent to BBC News by Ireland's Department of Agriculture, Food and the Marine. Depending on demand, veterinary inspectors may also be required to work at Shannon Airport or elsewhere, the statement adds. But the elephant in the room is whether inspectors could be posted at the Irish border - it's a question no-one seems keen to answer. Northern Ireland's Department of Agriculture says it has already recruited additional vets ""to assist preparedness for EU exit scenarios"" - but the UK government told BBC News: ""There won't be additional checks at on goods being imported from the EU."" Both the UK and Irish governments have stated they do no want to see the return of a hard border in Northern Ireland. But it remains unclear how both governments will get round the EU's animal inspection requirements for goods leaving Northern Ireland and entering the Republic of Ireland in the event of a no-deal Brexit. Border Inspection Posts (BIPs) are EU approved entry points for all products of animal origin that arrive from non-EU countries. They can be found at airports, ports and land bordersacross EU countries,external. The EU says BIPs must be located ""in the immediate vicinity of the point of entry"". However, it adds: ""Where necessitated by geographic constraints a BIP at a certain distance from the point of introduction may be tolerated."" The checks are carried out to protect animal and public health, and animal welfare. This video can not be played How are sheep exported across the Irish border? ""The EU is very strict on this,"" says Katy Hayward an expert in border studies, at Queen's University Belfast. ""After a series of incidents - like foot-and-mouth [disease] and the horsemeat scandal - the EU has become wary of products coming into continental Europe."" Food and live animals are a very important part of cross-border Irish trade, making up 33% of all Northern Ireland's exports to the Republic of Ireland in 2017. Dairy and eggs were Northern Ireland's biggest single export to the Republic of Ireland in 2016,worth just over Â£300m,external. Every year about 800 million litres of milk are transported from Northern Ireland to the Republic of Ireland to be processed. Northern Ireland also sends about 400,000 lambs to the Republic of Ireland each year, according to the Irish Farmers' Association. After Brexit, the Republic of Ireland will be the only land border the UK will share with the EU. But even at this late stage, it's unclear what might happen in the first few days in the event of a no-deal Brexit on 29 March. ""It's a completely new situation,"" says Viviane Gravey, co-chair of the Brexit and Environment Network - a group of independent researchers and policy specialists in Northern Ireland. There are two possible options, according to Ms Gravey. ""The EU could turn a blind eye to what is happening in Northern Ireland to start with and then gradually phase in some in some of the inspection requirements, building on the provisions of the backstop,"" he says. NI sheep farmers express tariff fears Brexit basics: What is the backstop? The backstop is an ""insurance policy"" - designed to avoid a hard border ""under all circumstances"" between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic. Under this, the first of Ms Gravey's two possible scenarios, goods from Northern Ireland could travel freely to the Republic of Ireland and the live animal checks would take place at existing Border Inspection Posts (such as Dublin) or EU-approved assembly centres in Northern Ireland. ""No-one wants a hard border and it makes more sense to do these checks in the ports where there is infrastructure,"" she says. But this would require a lot of goodwill from the EU and it would only be temporary. Northern Ireland imports over 400,000 pigs a year from the Republic of Ireland The second option, according to Ms Gravey, would be to halt food and animal trade between the two countries until the UK is registered with the EU as a safe third country of origin and additional Border Inspection Posts are put in place. But this would have big economic consequences for farmers and other producers. There is also a concern, despite the efforts to boost recruitment, there may not be enough vets available to carry out future inspections. ""A no-deal scenario could pose huge problems for an already stretched workforce in terms of the increased demand on veterinary capacity both north and south of the border,"" says the British Veterinary Association (BVA). Former EU ambassador says no-deal 'means hard border' Irish government hopes no-deal plan 'sits on shelf' And Aurelie Moralis, from the BVA's Northern Ireland branch, is asking the UK government to clarify what changes will be made to the way animals are currently transported between Northern Ireland and the Republic. Ironically, it's estimated that 95% of vets currently employed by the government in the meat hygiene sector are non-UK nationals from elsewhere in the EU. The Department for Environment Food and Rural said in response that it was ""working with the veterinary industry to ensure appropriate capacity"" and was providing free training for 450 government vets.

Ryan Adams cancels entire UK tourFans had been asking for refunds after the star was accused of sexual misconduct.Entertainment & Arts,"Adams had denied accusations of sexual misconduct Ryan Adams has cancelled his upcoming tour of the UK and Ireland, in the wake of allegations of sexual misconduct by the star. Nine dates, including two at London's Royal Albert Hall, have been scrapped. Several fans had already sought refunds, saying they could no longer support the artist. ""Full refunds to ticket purchasers will be processed by end of day on Monday,""said Ticketmaster in a tweet announcing the news,external. The cancellation comes two weeks after the New York Times published a report containing allegations that Adams had exchanged sexually inappropriate messages with a teenage girl. Adams' lawyer said the star ""unequivocally denies"" engaging in inappropriate communications with someone he knew was underage. The FBI later said it would investigate the texts to determine whether Adams was aware of her age. The New York Times story also contained interviews with several women who said Adams had offered them help with their careers as a pretext for sex, and allegations of psychological abuse from the musician's former wife, Mandy Moore. Adams' initial response was to threaten legal action, in a tweet that said the newspaper was ""going down"". He quickly deleted that message and issued a statement calling the article ""unsettlingly inaccurate,"" and apologising to anyone he had hurt, ""however unintentionally"".

LK Bennett lines up administrator,"The Duchess of Cambridge is an LK Bennett fan High-end fashion chain LK Bennett has lined up an administrator for the business as it desperately seeks funding to stay afloat. EY will oversee the insolvency if no new investment can be found,according to Sky,externalwhich first reported the story. The firm, which counts the Duchess of Cambridge among its customers, has 41 shops and 480 staff in the UK with many more shops and concessions globally. Famed for its kitten-heel shoes, it was founded by Linda Bennett in 1990. Ms Bennett - who was awarded an OBE in 2006 - said her aim was to bring ""a bit of Bond Street luxury to the High Street"". She sold her majority stake in the chain to private equity firm Phoenix Equity Partners in 2008, but in 2017 returned to advise the business after the retailer started to struggle, and a short time later bought the company back. The chain reported an operating loss of nearly Â£6m in the year to the end of July 2017, the most recent results available for the firm. The accounts show that on her return, Ms Bennett invested about Â£11.2m into the business. City centres 'could become ghost towns' Three things that could save the High Street In an email to staff, Ms Bennett said she had ""fought as hard as I can, with all your help to turn the business into the success that I know it deserves to be"". ""These are difficult and unstable times, and we are doing everything we can to identify the best way forward,"" she added. Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said the news was unexpected: ""This latest victim of the high street slump is as surprising as when Orla Kiely went into administration in September last year. ""If the British retail industry wasn't already nervous about business, it will be rocked to see that a second business with a  seemingly strong, high end core of customers has entered administration."" The chain's clothing is priced at the higher end of the High Street, with many of its dresses costing about Â£300. Catherine Shuttleworth, chief executive at shopper marketing agency Savvy, said this was one of the reasons it was struggling. ""Whilst it might be okay for Duchesses, most women will have to think twice before spending over Â£200 on a dress let alone Â£300. That combined with expensive store estates and a shopper who is spending more and more time online, it seems like the numbers aren't stacking up,"" she said. By Emma Simpson, BBC Business Correspondent Linda Bennett is one of Britain's most successful female entrepreneurs. She sold her business for around Â£70m. But founders who've built a business from scratch often find it difficult to let go. She bought it back again in late 2017, for a tiny fraction of the price. She admitted it was a risky move, given the incredibly challenging conditions on the High Street.  For any retailer, cashflow is king. I understand a key lender reduced the amount of money the business could borrow, and that a lack of credit insurance also added to the problems. Serious IT issues with its website and operational systems over the summer didn't help.  It meant that Linda Bennett was having to pour more and more of her own money in to keep the business afloat. A looming quarterly rent bill and rising business rates appears to have been the final straw. Administration now seems highly likely. Will she finally walk away from her beloved business or try to turn it around in a leaner, more sustainable form?  If she does, then it may be time to review its prices. LK Bennett is firmly on the High Street yet often twice as expensive as rivals, but it lacks the cachet to compete with the global designer brands. LK Bennett is one of a string of well-known names suffering in a tough High Street environment. Last year, Poundworld, Toys R Us and Maplin all went bust and disappeared from British High Streets altogether. Other household names - Homebase, Mothercare, Carpetright and New Look - were forced into restructuring deals with their landlords, closing hundreds of stores. Music chain HMV recently fell into administration before being bought. Uncertainty over Brexit, which sparked a fall in the pound and therefore raised the price of imported goods, as well as rising labour costs, higher business property taxes and the increasing popularity of online shopping have all contributed to retailers' woes.

Tesla cuts Model 3 price and closes stores,"Tesla has not said how many stores will be closed Tesla has announced it will start selling a version of its Model 3 in the US at a price of $35,000 (Â£26,400), finally delivering on a promise it made more than two years ago. To help lower the price the firm plans to close showrooms and is switching to an online-only sales model. The electric car company announced the Model 3 car in 2016 as an alternative to its luxury offerings. However, as recently as September, the average selling price exceeded $50,000. Shares in the company were down 8.4% to $292.97 on Friday, the day after the announcement. Closing physical stores will allow the firm to cut costs by about 5%, savings it is using to reduce prices across its line-up of vehicles, chief executive Elon Musk said. He declined to say how many stores would close, or how many people will lose their jobs as a result of the move, but said making the change was necessary as Tesla works toward its bigger goal of making electric cars mainstream. Tesla currently has 378 stores and service locations worldwide. Elon Musk tweet faces legal challenge Tesla reports profit as issues stabilise The weird and wonderful life of Elon Musk The Model 3 electric car has a range of 220 miles, a top speed of 130 mph and 0-60mph acceleration of 5.6 seconds. More than 400,000 customers signed up for the car when it was first announced, but production issues, higher prices and other delays caused troubles following its launch. Over the last year, the firm has shrunk the Model 3 battery, tweaked its manufacturing process, and reduced costs in other ways to hit the lower price, while still protecting profit margins. Mr Musk said he was not worried that a shift to online-only sales would put off customers. The firm already has a much smaller physical presence in the US than most other car companies. In a blog post, Tesla said,externala test drive was not needed because you can return a car within seven days, or after driving 1,000 miles, and get a full refund. ""Quite literally, you could buy a Tesla, drive several hundred miles for a weekend road trip with friends and then return it for free,"" the blog said. The company is confident that will not happen often. Tesla's website said cars ordered now would be ready for delivery in two to four weeks' time. However, customers with orders already in queue will get priority, which could delay some deliveries until June, Mr Musk said. The lower-priced model is expected to be available for order in Europe and China in three to six months' time. Tesla has already announced thousands of job cuts since June, as it tries to balance its books after years of losses. Strong sales of the Model 3 are critical to that effort. The firm managed to scrape a profit in the final two quarters of 2018, but Mr Musk said it expected to post a loss for the first three months of this year. ""It has been insanely difficult,"" Mr Musk said, referring to delivering on the $35,000 price promise. Delivering a car for $35,000 - about the average cost of a new vehicle in the US - is a ""potential game changer"" for Tesla's growth, said Daniel Ives, a managing director at Wedbush Securities. ""While there are still questions that need to be answered around logistics and delivery... we believe this strategic shift was the right move at the right time for Tesla,"" he wrote in a note. Coinciding with the price drop, Tesla is also bringing back its ""full self-driving"" feature after it removed it in October, following criticism it was overstating the autonomy of its cars. Tesla is now offering two software packages; regular autopilot, at a cost of $3,000 (Â£2,270) which will allow for automatic steering on highways or full self-driving ($5,000) which takes over more functions, such as changing lanes, navigating junctions and taking exits. According to chief executive, Elon Musk, the self-driving software will get an upgrade later this year which will allow it to navigate in more complex city environments. If you've ever wondered how those enormous Tesla stores in fancy shopping centres make money, well, they don't. At least, they don't make enough money for Tesla to keep them all open if it also wants to be able to afford to produce a $35,000 car - a car its investors (and many customers) have been desperately waiting for since it was announced way back in March 2016. The hope is that this is the car that brings a Tesla into the affordability zone for a whole new type of customer. It's still an incredibly expensive car for almost all of us, but for a luxury electric vehicle this is new ground. The Tesla brand, and its ramped up production capabilities, make it likely the cheap(er) Model 3 will turn out to be a popular proposition. But Tesla's admission it would not, as it had previously said, turn a profit this quarter, has spooked investors - as has admitting it needs to lay off workers and scale back its bricks-and-mortar presence in order to make good on a long-held promise is of concern. Coupled with his SEC woes lingering overhead, Mr Musk hasn't exactly lost his investors' confidence, but he hasn't exactly filled them with it either.

Uber drivers sue London's mayor,"Uber boasts that passengers can get a ride in minutes - but more cars mean more pollution and congestion Private hire drivers are taking legal action against London Mayor Sadiq Khan over the congestion charge. The group, which includes Uber drivers, says the charge, which they will have to pay from April, is discriminatory as 94% of them are from black, Asian and other minority ethnic backgrounds. London's ""black cab"" licensed taxis will remain exempt. The mayor's office says a rise in private hire vehicles is increasing congestion and air pollution. From 8 April, private hire vehicle drivers will have to pay the Â£11.50 daily congestion charge to drive in central London, under rules introduced by the mayor. Abdurzak Hadi says imposing the congestion charge on Uber drivers is unfair Uber driver Abdurzak Hadi says that as he drives in central London from Monday to Friday, he will be almost Â£60 a week worse off. ""I will be punished for coming to work. This is a tax on poor drivers,"" says Mr Hadi. Most drivers, such as those working for Uber, will have to pay the charge themselves and cannot pass it on to passengers, because it is the company that sets the rates for fares. London has roughly 114,000 private hire (PHV) drivers, who are overwhelmingly from black, Asian and other minority ethnic backgrounds, and this is what has led to a legal challenge. Minicabs including Uber to pay London congestion charge London black cab drivers lose Uber legal action A406 North Circular Road 'most congested' in the UK The 94% figure comes from a report to the mayor entitled""Changes to the Congestion Charge"",,externalproduced in the wake of a consultation, which Transport for London says received 10,000 responses. The report says: ""As the majority of PHV drivers (about 94%) are from black, Asian and minority ethnic backgrounds (BAME) and many are from deprived areas, there is a disproportionate impact on these groups."" However, it assesses the impact as being ""minor adverse"". The report also includes analysis showing that a majority of black cab drivers are white British. The Independent Workers' Union of Great Britain (IWGB), which represents private hire drivers, is seeking a judicial review of the mayor's decision on the basis that it indirectly discriminates against BAME PHV drivers. The union has now began that process by writing a pre-action letter to the mayor. Indirect discrimination is covered by the Equality Act 2010.  It occurs where there is a practice, policy or rule that is applied generally to a large group but results in a sub group that possesses a particular 'protected' characteristic being treated less favourably. Those characteristics include race, age, disability, sex or sexual orientation, religion or belief, gender reassignment, maternity and pregnancy, marriage or civil partnership. IWGB general secretary Dr Jason Moyer-Lee calls the congestion charging plan ""regressive"" and ""both discriminatory and fundamentally unfair"". ""We would urge the mayor to adopt one of the many alternative policies which would actually address congestion, instead of just penalising low-paid ethnic minority workers,"" says Dr Moyer-Lee. He argues that if the minimum wage was paid to all private hire drivers, taxi companies would control the number of drivers because they would not want cars circulating without paying passengers. Both black cab and Uber drivers have staged protests against threats to their earnings TfL figures show,externallicensed private hire drivers in the capital have almost doubled in less than a decade, from 59,000 in 2009-10 to 114,000 in 2017-18, while black cab drivers have fallen from 25,000 to just under 24,000. Last summer, New York capped its total number of private hire vehicles, and London's mayor is pressing ministers to give him similar powers to control their numbers in the city. The government has lost a number of legal challenges by environmental group ClientEarth over harmful levels of air pollution, and councils are under pressure to address the problem - with Birmingham and Greater Manchester considering the introduction of Clean Air Zones. Clean Air Zones are designated areas where drivers of more polluting vehicles are charged a penalty to drive. Unlike congestion charges, penalties only apply to vehicles that don't meet strict emissions standards, with the aim of reducing pollution in specific areas. Eleanor Roaf, of Greater Manchester council, said air pollution was ""making us sick"". ""It contributes to major health problems including breathing illnesses, heart disease, stroke and some cancers. And it affects the most vulnerable people in our society most badly - the elderly, sick, children and people living in the most deprived areas."" she continued. Reality Check: Do clean air zones work? Plan to fine vehicles for air pollution UK's most polluted towns and cities revealed This video can not be played Rosamund's nine-year-old daughter, Ella, died from an asthma attack which she says was caused by high levels of air pollution. The London mayor's office said the number of private hire vehicles entering the congestion charge zone had grown from 4,000 a day in 2003, to more than 18,000. It said: ""Congestion has a crippling impact on businesses across the capital. ""At the same time, our toxic air in London is a major public health crisis that is stunting the lung development of our children, leading to thousands of premature deaths, and increases the risk of asthma and dementia."" It says removing the congestion charge exemption for private hire vehicles is a key part of plans to reduce congestion and to protect Londoners from harmful emissions. However, the mayor's own assessment says that while the move will reduce private hire traffic by 6%, overall traffic will only go down by by 1%. Dr Moyer-Lee says this shows ""the biggest change envisaged by the mayor is not a real reduction in overall traffic but rather a shift away from minicabs to other vehicles"". Nicky Philpott of the UK Health Alliance on Climate Change welcomed the congestion charge expansion but suggested the government put the profits from it towards investment in active transport, such as walking and cycling, as well as public transport. She said: ""Air pollution is a UK public health emergency. It disproportionally affects the young, the old and those from lower socio economic backgrounds."" The mayor's office points out that only around a third of PHV drivers enter the congestion charge zone, so the majority will not be affected by the changes. It assesses the annual cost of congestion in London at around Â£5.5bn and predicts that, without action, by 2041 it could take more than an hour to travel 10km by road in central London, 15 minutes longer than today.

What has happened to al-Qaeda?,"Soldiers stand guard on the beach after the attack in Grand Bassam, Ivory Coast, in which 18 people were killed A deadly al-Qaedaattack on an Ivory Coast resort town in Marchreminded the world that the terror network once led by Osama Bin Laden has not gone away. But in recent years it has been eclipsed and diminished by the so-called Islamic State group which has attracted global attention, fighters and funds. So how depleted is the group which in 2001 triggered America's ""global war on terror""? Four experts talk to theBBC World Service Inquiry programme. Rahimullah Yusufzai is the editor of an English daily in Peshawar. ""Because of his education, his travels, his access to modern education and media, Osama Bin Laden knew about the world, about politics, and that's why he was a very charismatic leader for al-Qaeda. Before him, the others were fighting separately, but he brought them together, and then tried to build a coalition against the US and the Western world. ""Al-Qaeda used to say it was the first real jihad - or holy war - after decades, and that's why people flocked to [its training camps in Afghanistan]. ""They thought this is the best opportunity to fight jihad and to get trained in modern warfare. They trained thousands. These people eventually became the torch-bearers of jihad in the rest of the world. The death of Osama Bin Laden was extremely damaging to al-Qaeda ""In August 1998, the US attacked the same camp where I had met Osama Bin Laden in May 1998 because the US embassies [in Tanzania and Kenya] had been attacked. So the Americans were already trying to kill or capture him. ""Then after the 9/11 attacks, the US invaded Afghanistan, with the idea of destroying al-Qaeda, and removing the Taliban from power, because the Taliban had harboured Bin Laden. The Taliban were defeated in a few weeks - they had no answer to the American air power - but did not suffer many casualties. They just retreated, and melted away in the villages. ""When the Americans invaded, al-Qaeda decided to go to Tora Bora on the border with Pakistan. The Americans came to know Bin Laden was there in December 2001, and bombed heavily. I was told it was the heaviest bombing since World War Two on one target. ""Bin Laden was able to escape with the help of local Afghans, and came to Pakistan. When they attacked Tora Bora, the Americans were pushing Pakistan to block the border, to deploy a force. Pakistan actually co-operated, and for the first time deployed its troops on the borders. ""Then they launched bigger military action, because the militants were then everywhere. One of the biggest achievements is that the militants lost their strongholds. They were in control of many areas - Swat, Bajaur, Momon, South Waziristan, North Waziristan. They lost almost all these areas. ""But I think the death of Osama Bin Laden was the biggest setback, because he was the founder, the financier, the inspiration. It has never really recovered from that loss, because the new leader Dr Zawahiri is not as important, and does not have that status or authority which Bin Laden had."" Professor Fawaz Gerges teaches at the London School of Economics and is a prolific writer about Jihadi groups. ""Al-Qaeda has always been a top-down elitist movement. Decisions were made from the top and everyone followed. But once al-Qaeda dispersed after the American-led invasion of Afghanistan in 2001, al-Qaeda fractured, decentralised. The various elements spread near and far into Pakistan, Afghanistan, Yemen, Iran and then Northern Iraq. ""[In Iraq] Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was obsessed with the Shi'ites as a dagger in the heart of Iraq and the Muslim world, plunging Iraq into all-out civil war between the Sunnis and the Shi'ites, carrying out thousands of suicide bombings against the Shi'ites. Abu Musab al-Zarqawi was killed by a US strike in June 2006 ""Bin Laden and his second-in-command Zawahiri tried to rein Zarqawi in many times. We have several letters of Bin Laden urging him to stop the bloodshed against the Shi'ites, to keep the focus on the far enemy, the Americans: 'don't lose the fight in Iraq'. ""Zarqawi ignored their pleas. He became the central focus of the young men and women who wanted to join al-Qaeda. In many ways, al-Qaeda in Iraq overshadowed al-Qaeda central. He became the real action man who could deliver death and vengeance against the enemies. ""Many Sunnis realised - belatedly - that Zarqawi was not their friend. He was their enemy because he had his own agenda. The Americans did not defeat al-Qaeda in Iraq: it was the Sunnis who revolted against him. Many fighters went underground, were killed. ""But a core of al-Qaeda in Iraq survived, and bade its time waiting for the right opportunity to strike back. This came in 2010. ""2010 was a very critical period because of Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi. He reconstructed both the military and the operational structure of al-Qaeda in Iraq to bring in hundreds of skilled officers of the former army and police of Saddam Hussein. It became the Islamic State of Iraq. ""[When Islamic State captured Mosul in 2014 and declared a Caliphate] it was a shattering blow to al-Qaeda central. In many ways the Isis (Islamic State in Iraq and Syria) takeover of Mosul was really the takeover of the global jihadist movement. Isis was not just going for the Islamic state. It was also making a bid for the leadership of the global jihadist movement. They have stolen the show."" Charles Lister is a fellow at the Middle East Institute, a US think tank, and over the past two years has had regular meetings with the leaders of over 100 Syrian armed opposition groups. ""Al-Qaeda has adapted to playing a long game strategy in which the focus has become more on building alliances and socialising local communities into being a long-term and durable base from which it can eventually launch its more trans-national objectives. ""It was a reassessment of al-Qaeda's PR strategy, the way it seeks to present itself to local populations from within which it operates, and a lot of lessons were learned from Iraq. ""In his guidelines for jihad, Zawahiri was extremely keen to send a message that instead of [killing civilians], we should fight the fight that the civilians themselves want to fight. That means military targets, security targets, not public markets or mosques, which al-Qaeda's affiliates in Iraq had previously been doing. ""In the winter of 2012/2013, [al-Qaeda's Syrian branch] Jabhat al-Nusra began to present itself not just as an armed movement, but also a social one. Jabhat al-Nusra fighters help a wounded man following a reported barrel bomb attack by government forces in Aleppo in 2014 ""It took over the management of bakeries, and forced their owners to charge a lower price. Jabhat al-Nusra was directly involved in trucking and delivering gas, bread, water and other staple food supplies to the civilian population at a far cheaper price than had been available before, and it was at that period that we started to see Jabhat al-Nusra actually gain support. ""There was a series of interesting letters found in Mali in a building that had been controlled by al-Qaeda and the Islamic Maghreb (AQIM). One was from AQIM overall leader Abou Mossab Abdelwadoud in which he instructed his fighters to pull back from the extreme measures they had been trying to impose on the people. ""He was essentially describing Mali to his fighters as a baby, saying 'Your focus right now should be on teaching it the basics, raising it to be a true Muslim, and only years from now will you then be able to introduce the more harsh norms because the people will understand what is expected of them.' ""We are seeing that replication of the long game model in Yemen with extraordinarily successful consequences so far. It's no surprise that we don't hear about this very much in the news anymore: it has become almost impossible to differentiate who is al-Qaeda and who is a tribal fighter in southern Yemen. ""This new strategy makes al-Qaeda more dangerous. It shows that al-Qaeda is willing to be pragmatic, to cut back some of its religious expectations for the sake of building popular support that will gain it strength in the long term. That is something that Isis has essentially refused to do, and that means that we face that much more of a challenge of rooting it out of these societies. ""My fear is in the long term, al-Qaeda is going to be that much more durable, and the threat that they will pose will be the same as they posed in the period immediately prior to 9/11."" Katherine Zimmerman is a research fellow at the conservative US think tank the American Enterprise Institute. ""Al-Qaeda is much stronger than people realise. ""The al-Qaeda donors haven't changed that much over the years - very conservative sheiks, particularly in the Gulf - but when you look at how al-Qaeda makes money and runs day to day as an organisation, it's less based on donations and more based on the fact that it controls terrain on the ground and taxes directly the population or benefits from trade imports, exports, etc. ""So it's very hard to isolate al-Qaeda's finances and prevent it from funding itself as long as it controls terrain. The power previously held by Bin Laden and Zawahiri has fragmented among affiliate groups ""The hierarchy is no longer contained in a single geographical space but dispersed throughout the affiliated groups. The al-Qaeda affiliates are really no less dangerous than the al-Qaeda core group that we think about. They all have that same capability to conduct an attack. ""Al-Zawahiri certainly doesn't have the charisma that Osama Bin Laden had and that has been the main critique against him. But we've seen al-Qaeda start to shape and build up new leadership, and these include leaders in Yemen and in Syria in particular. ""[Yemen-based Saudi militant Ibrahim al-Asiri] is a bomb expert and he has an incredibly innovative mind. The man has trained other individuals and he's the mind behind the underwear bomb, the bombs disguised as printer cartridges and various other plots where they escaped intelligence agency's detection because of how well these bombs were designed. He's certainly a threat in terms of being able to bring a capability to the table for al-Qaeda. ""We are in danger of underestimating and frankly missing the threat. The real risk we face is fighting Isis and ignoring the presence of al-Qaeda. The Islamic State has seized control of vast swathes of land but it controls the population through coercion. ""Al-Qaeda doesn't control the population. It has the support of it. That's much, much more difficult to counter."" The Inquiryis broadcast on the BBC World Service on Tuesdays from 12:05 GMT.

Legal battle starts over Brexit ferry deals,"Seaborne Freight had its contract for the Ramsgate-to-Ostend route revoked The government is facing a court challenge over the contracts it awarded to three shipping firms as part of its no-deal Brexit preparations. Eurotunnel, which operates railway services between the UK and France, says the contracts were handed out in a ""secretive"" way. The firm says it was not given the chance to compete and wants the contracts quashed. The case, which starts on Friday, is expected to conclude next week. At the end of December, the Department for Transport (DfT) contracted three suppliers - Brittany Ferries, DFDS and Seaborne Freight - to provide additional freight capacity for lorries at ports other than Dover, in the event that a no-deal Brexit leads to congestion on roads down to the coast. In documents outlining the agreements, the DfT stated that an ""unforeseeable"" situation of ""extreme urgency"" meant there was no time for the contracts to be put out to tender - the standard practice for public procurements. One firm, Seaborne Freight, has already had its contract cancelled after the Irish company backing the deal pulled out. Shortly after it was awarded the contract, the BBC found out that Seaborne had no ships and had never run a ferry service. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has been heavily criticised for the Seaborne deal, which would have been worth Â£13.8m. In January, Eurotunnel wrote to Mr Grayling to complain that it had not been considered when the contracts were awarded. It argues that unlike Seaborne, it has actually run a cross-Channel ferry service (MyFerryLink, which closed in 2015) and should have been approached. Transport secretary Chris Grayling has been criticised over how the process has been handled The company also claims that the government had ample time to conduct a full and open procurement process, and that the Department for Transport could have foreseen a no-deal Brexit well before the end of last year. Government sued over no-deal ferry contracts No-deal Brexit ferry contract scrapped UK to spend Â£800k on Eurotunnel Brexit case Customs checks simplified for no-deal Brexit Eurotunnel's lawyers will also argue that the DfT has fallen foul of EU public procurement laws. For its part, the government will argue that it was not aware that Eurotunnel was in a position to get a ferry service up and running in time for Brexit, and that it approached all of the companies which currently operate ferries between the UK and the rest of Europe. It will also claim it was not seeking extra rail capacity, and in any case, the purpose of the contracts were to divert lorries away from Eurotunnel's base in Dover or Folkestone, and towards other ports. Eurotunnel has previously voiced concerns more broadly about the potential impact of a no-deal Brexit on its business. If the court finds in its favour, all three contracts, including those with Brittany Ferries and DFDS, could be ruled ""ineffective"". Andrew Dean, a director at law firm Clifford Chance, and a former government advisor, said that in such a scenario, ""a critical part of the country's no-deal Brexit preparations could be swept away just weeks before Brexit Day on 29 March"". He added that ""the government could face substantial civil fines and be forced to pay damages to Eurotunnel."" Analysis: Joe Miller, BBC Business reporter Chris Grayling's Department for Transport first posted notices of its three Brexit ferry contracts onto an EU portal on Christmas Eve, probably in the assumption that they wouldn't attract much attention. But days later, the awards were headline news, and the DfT was under fire from MPs for handing a contract to Seaborne Freight, which had never sailed a vessel. While seven ferry operators, and two potential operators were approached (including Seaborne), Eurotunnel was not, and it says its business could be disadvantaged as a result. The government will have to defend its entire procurement process, and specifically prove three things. First, that there was a need for extra freight capacity at the end of March. Second, that there was indeed no time for a full public tender process. And third that it could not have foreseen the probability of a no-deal Brexit, and had to rush things through when such a scenario became likely. Legal experts believe proving the last point that will be the biggest challenge for Mr Grayling's lawyers. And if they fail to convince the court of the need for urgency, one of the transport secretary's key Brexit contingency plans could be ripped up less than a month before Britain is scheduled to leave the EU.

Michael Jackson 'abused us hundreds of times'Two men tell the BBC the singer sexually abused them from the ages of seven and 10.Entertainment & Arts,"This video can not be played ""Every time I stayed the night with him, he abused me"" Two men have told the BBC they were abused hundreds of times by Michael Jackson, from the ages of seven and 10. Wade Robson, 36, told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme the singer had sexually abused him from the age of seven and tried to rape him when he was 14. James Safechuck, 40, told the programme Jackson had sexually abused him ""from the age of 10 until around 14"". Jackson's family say there's ""not one piece of evidence"" to prove the claims. The two men have also spoken out in the documentary Leaving Neverland. Asked if the abuse had occurred ""hundreds and hundreds of times"", both Mr Robson and Mr Safechuck agreed that this had been the case. Mr Robson told the programme: ""Every time I was with him, every time I stayed the night with him, he abused me."" Jackson had fondled him, ""touching my entire body"", and made him watch the singer performing a sex act, he said. And then, when he was 14, Jackson had tried to rape him. ""That was one of the last sexual abuse experiences we had,"" Mr Robson told the programme. In Leaving Neverland, Wade Robson (pictured) says Jackson sexually abused him in the 1990s Jackson had groomed him to believe they ""loved each other - and this is how we show our love"", he said. ""And then he would immediately follow that up with, 'But If anybody else ever found out what we are doing, you and I would go to jail for the rest of our lives and our lives would fall apart,' he and I would fall apart,"" Mr Robson told the programme. ""All of this was terrifying to me. ""The idea of being pulled away from Michael - this man, this other-worldly figure, this god to me who had now become my best friend - no way was I going to do anything that would pull me away from him."" Michael Jackson doc director challenges 'cult of celebrity' Jackson doc is 'disturbing and devastating' Channel 4 rejects Jackson estate complaint over documentary Mr Robson said Jackson had told him ""I was his best friend and the only person he had ever done these sexual acts with"". ""So therefore I was - out of all the boys in the world - the chosen one, I thought,"" he said. Mr Safechuck told the programme his abuse had begun with Jackson teaching him how to perform a sex act, at the age of 10. ""Then you start French kissing - he said I taught him how to do that,"" Mr Safechuck said. And this had been followed by further abuse and other sex acts. Watch the Victoria Derbyshire programme's full interview with Wade Robson and James Safechuck from 10:00 GMT on the BBC News Channel in the UK. Mr Safechuck told the programme Jackson had been able to abuse him over such a sustained period of time because he had also successfully groomed his parents. ""There's a long grooming process where Michael inserts himself into your family and becomes a part of your family,"" he said. ""It takes him a while to build up the trust - it doesn't happen overnight."" And he then ""makes a wedge between you and your parents - and he isolates you from everybody else"". ""At the same time when you're being abused, a part of you is dying,"" Mr Safechuck added. Mr Robson also described Jackson as a ""master manipulator"". He had driven ""this wedge between myself and my father, [and] my mother and my father"" to make it easier for the abuse to occur, he told the programme. He also said part of the responsibility for the abuse should fall ""at the door of all the other people, all the other employees that were around Michael and me and James [Safechuck] all the time, who looked the other way"". Fans turned the entrance to Neverland into a shrine after the singer died In response, Michael Jackson's brothers Tito, Marlon and Jackie, and nephew Taj Jackson rejected the claims in Leaving Neverland - which is broadcast in the UK next week - that the singer had abused children. Taj said his uncle's behaviour had seemed odd to some but had been ""very innocent"", adding: ""His naivety was his downfall."" And Marlon said there was ""not one piece of evidence"" to back up the allegations. Michael Jackson's estate, meanwhile said Mr Robson and Mr Safechuck had previously ""testified under oath that these events never occurred"". ""They have provided no independent evidence and absolutely no proof in support of their accusations, which means the entire film hinges solely on the word of two perjurers,"" it said.

Quick pregnancy 'safe after stillbirth',"There is no reason to delay having another baby after a stillbirth, research in the Lancet suggests. Although women are often told to wait for a year before getting pregnant again, there is little evidence to back up this advice. This international study,externalof 14,000 births found no increased risk of problems if conception happened earlier. A UK stillbirth expert said the findings were important and reassuring. About one in every 225 births in the UK ends in stillbirth, which is defined as the death of a baby after 24 weeks of pregnancy in the UK. However, in this study, a stillbirth is defined as a baby's death after 22 weeks' pregnancy. Stillbirth rates have been gradually reducing in the UK since 2000, and more sharply since 2015, but compared with many other European countries, improvements in the UK have been slow. In many countries there is limited guidance available on planning future pregnancies after stillbirth, the study says. 'I am a mother without a baby' My baby died. Please ask me his name Gary Barlow opens up about stillbirth 'Not holding my baby is my biggest regret' Manchester University's Prof Alex Heazell, spokesman for Tommy's stillbirth charity and the Royal College of Obstetrics and Gynaecology, said his message to women was ""not to worry"". ""As long as they get all the information about why their baby died, then the choice of when to have another baby is down to when they are psychologically ready."" He said there was no physiological reason to wait more than a year before trying for another baby. ""Stress may exacerbate things and so waiting until that goes may be a reason for some to hold off,"" Prof Heazell said. The researchers looked at the birth records of 14,452 women who had previously had a stillbirth in Western Australia, Finland and Norway over 37 years. A total of 2% of those subsequent pregnancies ended in stillbirth, 18% were preterm births and 9% were babies born small for their age. The study found that those who conceived within 12 months of stillbirth were no more likely to have another stillbirth, or a preterm birth, than women who left two or more years between pregnancies, Out of the births studied, 9,109 or 63% were conceived within 12 months of the stillbirth. The study, led by Dr Annette Regan, from Curtin University in Australia, said the findings were useful for clinicians who give counselling after stillbirths. She said women who did not leave enough time to recover after a previous pregnancy could be at risk of ""poor nutritional status, which has been linked to increased risk of foetal growth restriction and birth defects"". But she said this may be less likely to occur after a pregnancy loss, such as stillbirth or miscarriage. Commenting on the research, Mark A Klebanoff, from the Research Institute at Nationwide Children's Hospital in the US, said there were other factors to consider. ""Rather than adhering to hard and fast rules, clinical recommendations should consider a woman's current health status, her current age in conjunction with her desires regarding child spacing and ultimate family size, and particularly following a loss, her emotional readiness to become pregnant again."" A stillbirth is when a baby is born dead after 24 completed weeks of pregnancy If the baby dies before 24 completed weeks, it is known as a miscarriage or late foetal loss Some stillbirths are linked to complications with the placenta, a birth defect or with the mother's health.

Australia records hottest-ever summer,"Most regions of Australia experienced prolonged summer heatwaves, meteorologists say Australia has experienced its hottest summer on record, according to the nation's Bureau of Meteorology. Hundreds of individual heat records were shattered across the country over the past three months. The warm weather, 2.14C above the long-term average, caused bushfires, blackouts and a rise in hospital admissions. Wildlife also suffered, with reports of mass deaths of wild horses, native bats and fish. ""The real standout was just how widespread and prolonged each heatwave was - almost everywhere was affected,"" climatologist Blair Trewin told the BBC. Temperatures had exceeded the previous hottest summer in 2012-13 by nearly 1C, he added - ""a very large margin for a national record"". In pictures: How they weathered the heat Australia boils in record-breaking heat Why Australia's extreme heat might be here to stay The long-term average summer temperature in Australia is considered to be 27.5C,the bureau said in a statement,externalon Friday. Australia experienced at least five of its warmest days on record in January - the nation's hottest month ever. Every state and territory was affected, but South Australia, Victoria and New South Wales bore the brunt of the extreme temperatures. Among other impacts: In Tasmania, fire crews battled dozens of bushfires in World Heritage-listed forests Soaring air conditioner use prompted widespread power outages across Melbourne More than 90 wild horses were found dead or dyingin a dried-up waterhole in the Northern Territory. This video can not be played Millions of dead fish were found in New South Wales ""This was definitely outside what is normal conditions for this decade - it was a very unusual summer,"" said Mr Trewin. A pattern of warmer seasons is ""consistent with observed climate change"", said the bureau. Officials have confirmed that 2018 and 2017 were Australia's third and fourth-hottest years on record respectively. The bureau'sState of the Climate 2018 report said climate change had led to an increase in extreme heat events,externaland increased the severity of other natural disasters, such as drought. Parts of eastern Australia continue to suffer through their worst droughtin recent history. Drought seen from the air Extreme floods kill 500,000 cattle Even if global temperatures are contained to the Paris accord limit of a 2C rise above pre-industrial levels,scientists believe the country is facing a dangerous new normal.

'Ineffective' probation reforms cost ÃÂ£500m,"Problems with the partial privatisation of the probation system in England and Wales have cost taxpayers almost Â£500m, the government spending watchdog says. Under the changes, which began in 2013, firms were given contracts to supervise low and medium-risk offenders. The National Audit Office said reforms were ""rushed"" and the numbers returning to prison for breaching their licence conditions had since ""skyrocketed"". The government said this was because more offenders were being monitored. Prior to the reforms, which were designed to drive down re-offending rates, convicts who had served less than one year did not have to be supervised by probation services. But from 2015 every criminal given a custodial sentence became subject to statutory supervision and rehabilitation upon release into the community. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said this meant an extra 40,000 offenders were being supported each year. The NAO report said that between January 2015 and September 2018, the number of offenders recalled to prison for breaching their licence condition increased by almost half, from 4,240 to 6,240. Over the same period, the percentage of offenders recalled to custody who had received sentences of less than 12 months increased from 3% to 36%. Private probation contracts to end early Probation system 'a mess', say MPs Prisoners 'lack support after release' The NAO said the MoJ had ""set itself up to fail"" after it used a payment-by-results model which was ""inappropriate"" for probation services. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said the ""scathing"" report raised ""serious questions about decision-making at the Ministry of Justice"". In 2013 the MoJ began a major reform of probation services, partially privatising it in England and Wales. It involved 21 companies - known as community rehabilitation companies (CRCs) - monitoring people who had been released from jail after serving short sentences. But the report says the MoJ designed and implemented its reforms too quickly. By March 2018, the CRCs were facing losses of Â£294m over the lifetime of their contracts - compared with the profits of Â£269m they had been expecting to start with. Four months later, the government acknowledged that the quality of probation services being delivered was not good enough and announced the MoJ would end the contracts with the CRCs in 2020 - 14 months early. The report estimates that additional payments to CRCs beyond the original terms of the contracts will cost the department Â£296m, and terminating the contracts early will cost at least Â£171m. The full cost to the taxpayer will not be known until at least December 2020, the report says. It concludes that the MoJ's contracts were ""ineffective"" and hampered its ability to hold providers to account for poor services. Overall, it noted ""little progress"" had been made on transforming probation services. Rory Stewart, prisons and probation minister, said the performance of CRCs was ""too often deeply disappointing"". ""That is why we have stepped in to end contracts early and invested an extra Â£22m a year in services for offenders on release,"" he said. Meg Hillier, who chairs the Commons Public Accounts Committee which scrutinises the value for money of public spending, said the MoJ's ""botched contracting"" had left this ""essential service"" underfunded. ""The ministry now needs to reflect and ensure that its new proposals can deliver the much-needed improvements to probation services,"" she added. Katie Lomas, chair of the probation officers union Napo, said bringing in providers with no experience in probation and splitting the service into two separate organisations was always going to bring additional costs. She told the BBC that the government should ""pause and reflect"" before enacting further reforms to ensure the same mistakes were not repeated. The chief inspector of probation, Dame Glenys Stacey, welcomed the NAO report, for bringing ""greater transparency"" to probation funding and contracts.

But from 2015 every criminal given a custodial sentence became subject to statutory supervision and rehabilitation upon release into the community. The Ministry of Justice (MoJ) said this meant an extra 40,000 offenders were being supported each year. The NAO report said that between January 2015 and September 2018, the number of offenders recalled to prison for breaching their licence condition increased by almost half, from 4,240 to 6,240. Over the same period, the percentage of offenders recalled to custody who had received sentences of less than 12 months increased from 3% to 36%. Private probation contracts to end early Probation system 'a mess', say MPs Prisoners 'lack support after release' The NAO said the MoJ had ""set itself up to fail"" after it used a payment-by-results model which was ""inappropriate"" for probation services. BBC home affairs correspondent Danny Shaw said the ""scathing"" report raised ""serious questions about decision-making at the Ministry of Justice"". In 2013 the MoJ began a major reform of probation services, partially privatising it in England and Wales. It involved 21 companies - known as community rehabilitation companies (CRCs) - monitoring people who had been released from jail after serving short sentences. But the report says the MoJ designed and implemented its reforms too quickly. By March 2018, the CRCs were facing losses of Â£294m over the lifetime of their contracts - compared with the profits of Â£269m they had been expecting to start with. Four months later, the government acknowledged that the quality of probation services being delivered was not good enough and announced the MoJ would end the contracts with the CRCs in 2020 - 14 months early. The report estimates that additional payments to CRCs beyond the original terms of the contracts will cost the department Â£296m, and terminating the contracts early will cost at least Â£171m. The full cost to the taxpayer will not be known until at least December 2020, the report says. It concludes that the MoJ's contracts were ""ineffective"" and hampered its ability to hold providers to account for poor services. Overall, it noted ""little progress"" had been made on transforming probation services. Rory Stewart, prisons and probation minister, said the performance of CRCs was ""too often deeply disappointing"". ""That is why we have stepped in to end contracts early and invested an extra Â£22m a year in services for offenders on release,"" he said. Meg Hillier, who chairs the Commons Public Accounts Committee which scrutinises the value for money of public spending, said the MoJ's ""botched contracting"" had left this ""essential service"" underfunded. ""The ministry now needs to reflect and ensure that its new proposals can deliver the much-needed improvements to probation services,"" she added. Katie Lomas, chair of the probation officers union Napo, said bringing in providers with no experience in probation and splitting the service into two separate organisations was always going to bring additional costs. She told the BBC that the government should ""pause and reflect"" before enacting further reforms to ensure the same mistakes were not repeated. The chief inspector of probation, Dame Glenys Stacey, welcomed the NAO report, for bringing ""greater transparency"" to probation funding and contracts.

N Korea: We won't move on talks with Trump,"This video can not be played BBC's Laura Bicker explains why Trump is the 'biggest loser' from the summit North Korea has denied US President Donald Trump's claim that the country demanded total sanctions relief during a failed summit in Hanoi. The North's Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho was speaking after talks between US President Donald Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong-un ended without agreement. He said they asked only for partial sanctions relief in exchange for disabling its main nuclear complex. The US insists this is not the case. After their talks broke down, Mr Trump said Mr Kim had offered to dismantle all of the Yongbyon complex, the research and production facility at the heart of North Korea's nuclear programme, a significant proposal. But in return Mr Kim wanted all sanctions lifted, something the US was not prepared to offer, Mr Trump added. At a late-night news conference after Thursday's summit, Mr Ri said his country had made ""realistic"" proposals, including the complete decommissioning of Yongbyon, under the watch of US observers. ""This proposal was the biggest denuclearisation measure we could take at the present stage when taking into consideration the current level of confidence between the DPRK [North Korea] and the United States."" What to make of the summit collapse? Kim's hiding sister and other unreal moments In return, Mr Ri said, the North had wanted only partial lifting of sanctions ""that hamper the civilian economy and the livelihood of our people"". Ri Yong-ho said an opportunity had been missed He told reporters Pyongyang had also offered to permanently halt nuclear and long-range rocket testing. He added that it might be hard to see an opportunity such as the Hanoi summit again. ""Our principal stand will remain invariable and our proposals will never change, even if the United States proposes negotiations again in the future."" By Jonathan Head, BBC News, Hanoi President Trump was more philosophical than defensive over the summit failure, suggesting he half-expected it to happen. And the North Korean reaction so far, from Foreign Minister Ri Yong-ho, has been measured. This was, to the participants, less a shock than a disappointment. US officials say the North Koreans would not define exactly what they meant by the Yongbyon complex; the US is believed to have asked to include other hitherto unpublished nuclear facilities. Nor could the two sides agree on what denuclearisation means. US officials say they were being offered an end to testing, and partial destruction of facilities but that leaves North Korea's existing nuclear arsenal intact. Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said they had cleared away what he called ""a lot of the brush"" in the weeks of pre-summit talks, but there remained gaps between the two sides they had hoped to close when the two leaders were in the same room. That didn't happen. President Trump has shown Chairman Kim that, notwithstanding his hunger for a deal, he is prepared to walk away. But he has also shown the world that his famous deal-making skills are no match for a diplomatic problem as thorny as North Korea. At a news conference after the summit, Mr Trump also said: ""It was all about the sanctions. They wanted the sanctions lifted in their entirety and we couldn't do that. Sometimes you have to walk and this was one of those times."" Yongbyon: The heart of NK's nuclear programme North Korea in nine charts Following Mr Ri's comments, US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo, who took part in the summit in Hanoi, reaffirmed that North Korea had ""basically asked for full sanctions relief"". ""They were pretty expansive with respect to what they're prepared to do at Yongbyon but there was still not complete clarity with respect to full scope of what it is they were prepared to offer,"" he told reporters. The US was ""anxious to get back to the table"" to continue the talks, he added. On the flight back to the US, Mr Trump reassured Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe and South Korean President Moon Jae-in that talks with the North would continue, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said. Later she wrote on Twitter:,external""President Obama refused to walk away from a bad deal with Iran. President [Trump] refuses to make the same mistake with Iran, North Korea, or anybody else. President Trump will always put the safety of the American people above politics."" Another contentious point included the network of facilities that extend beyond Yongbyon. Last month, Stephen Biegun, the US state department special representative for North Korea,said Pyongyang had committed in pre-summit talks,externalto destroy all the nation's plutonium - and uranium-enrichment facilities, dependent on unspecified US measures in return. Those unspecified US measures appear to have been complete sanctions relief, which Mr Trump would not offer. The US president also suggested in his news conference that Mr Kim had offered only the destruction of Yongbyon and not North Korea's entire nuclear apparatus. This video can not be played The moment Kim Jong-un answered a question from a foreign reporter Yongbyon is North Korea's only known source of plutonium but the country is believed to have at least two other facilities where uranium is enriched. Mr Trump said when he raised the issue of a second enrichment facility apart from Yongbyon, the North Korean delegation was ""surprised"" by what the US knew.

"5,000 online grooming cases in 18 months","Sex offenders are grooming children on Instagram more than on any other online platform, a charity has found. Police in England and Wales recorded 1,944 incidents of sexual communication with children in the six months to September 2018, the NSPCC said. Instagram was used in 32% of the 1,317 cases where a method was recorded, Facebook in 23% and Snapchat in 14%. Instagram and Facebook said they ""aggressively"" fought grooming, while Snapchat said it was ""unacceptable"". Following pressure from campaigners,sexual communication with a child,externalbecame an offence in April 2017. In the 18 months that followed, more than 5,000 online grooming offences were recorded by police, according to the data gathered by the NSPCC. How can I keep my kids safe online? The charity said the figures did not ""fully reflect the scale of the issue"", as many crimes went undetected or unreported. Where the police logged age and gender, seven out of 10 victims were girls aged 12 to 15. One in five was aged 11 or under. The youngest victim was five years old. The NSPCC said 39 of the 43 police forces in England and Wales responded to Freedom of Information requests, with only Surrey, Sussex, Northampton and City of London police failing to provide data. The children's charity is calling for new laws to force social media firms to do more to protect children. In one case of abuse given by the charity, a girl was groomed by a 24-year-old man when she was 13. Emily - not her real name - met the man through a friend. He had introduced himself, saying he was 16, which quickly changed to 18. She told him she was 13. Later that evening he added her on Facebook and Snapchat. Emily said: ""It escalated very quickly from there. We exchanged texts which quickly became sexual, then photos and videos before arranging for him to come and pick me up after school. ""He drove me somewhere quietâ¦ and took me into the woods and had sex with me. He drove me in the direction of home straight afterwards, refusing to even talk, and then kicked me out of the car at the traffic lights. ""I was bleeding and crying. This was my first sexual experience."" Emily's mother said: ""We felt as though we had failed as parents - we knew about these social media sites, we thought we were doing everything we could to ensure our children's safety when they were online, but we still couldn't protect Emily."" NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless accused social media networks of ""10 years of failed self-regulation"". ""These figures are overwhelming evidence that keeping children safe cannot be left to social networks. We cannot wait for the next tragedy before tech companies are made to act,"" he said. CBBC's 8 top tips for staying safe online Ahead of the government publishing a delayed white paper on online harm, the charity is pushing for statutory regulation to enforce a legal duty of care to children on social networks, with a penalty of substantial fines if they fail. A National Crime Agency spokesperson said: ""It is vital that online platforms used by children and young people have in place robust mechanisms and processes to prevent, identify and report sexual exploitation and abuse, including online grooming. ""Children and young people also need easy access to mechanisms allowing them to alert platforms to potential offending. A spokesperson for Facebook, which also owns Instagram, said keeping young people safe was its ""top priority. ""We use advanced technology and work closely with the police and CEOP [Child Exploitation and Online Protection] to aggressively fight this type of content and protect young people."" Dating apps 'must not risk child safety' Fortnite predator 'groomed children in-game' Train firm in overcrowding pledge,external A Snapchat spokesperson said the exploitation of any member of its community, especially a young person, was ""absolutely unacceptable"". ""We go to great lengths to prevent and respond to this type of illegal activity on our platform,"" they added. The platform recommends young people keep their privacy settings restricted, do not share their username publicly and do not add people they do not know as friends. A spokesperson from the Home Office said both the home secretary and culture secretary had ""engaged tech firms about their responsibilities towards protecting people"". Last year the home secretary announced a Â£250,000""innovation call"",externalfor organisations to help develop new ways to disrupt the live streaming of abuse.

Umunna made Independent Group spokesman,"Former Labour MP Chuka Umunna has been named as the spokesman for the new Independent Group of MPs. The Streatham MP is one of eight former Labour members to join the breakaway group, alongside three Conservatives. Ex-Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston has been assigned responsibility for ""new colleagues"". Mr Umunna said the group would ""draw on all the talents and experiences of our group"" but as it was not a political party, it would not have a leader. The group says it aims to ""change politics"" and offer voters ""a proper alternative to the broken politics being offered by the main political parties"". The Independent Group: Who are they and what do they stand for? Independent Group elects Shuker as 'convener' Who are the MPs resigning? The other roles agreed for its members are: Mr Umunna said: ""The roles and responsibilities we have assigned recognise that all the members of our group have the right to be heard and a responsibility to provide leadership. ""Our structure is designed to be flexible to accommodate any changes as the group evolves and grows."" The group is now joint fourth-largest with the Lib Dems in Parliament. Among its members' reasons for leaving their parties were the government's handling of Brexit and Labour's Brexit stance - as well as the Labour leadership's handling of anti-Semitism. The Independent Group will have to register as a political party with the Electoral Commission if it is to contest seats in future elections - and would then have to report donations. Sources said it planned to register as a party but did not yet have a name and was not talking to big donors - but had received thousands of small donations. They said former Labour prime minister Tony Blair,who has previously been linked with suggestions a new centre-ground party would be set up, did not know the group was about to form.

Will mobile roaming charges return?,"Virgin Media O2 has announced it will not start charging Virgin Mobile or O2 customers extra for using their phones in Europe. Three, EE and Vodafone are all reintroducing roaming fees for customers travelling to the EU. Between 2017 and the end of 2020, UK consumers were able, within reason, to use the minutes, texts and data included on their mobile phone tariffs when travelling in the EU. But since January 2021, UK operators have been allowed to reintroduce so-called roaming charges because the UK left the EU and theBrexit trade dealdid not rule them out. None of the networks will be charging for roaming in the Republic of Ireland. From 23 May 2022, Three customers who have signed up or upgraded from October 2021 will have to pay Â£2 a day to use the minutes and data from their UK contracts in EU countries. It is also introducing a Â£5 a day charge for roaming in some countries outside the EU, where it previously allowed free roaming. EE will also be charging Â£2 a day in Europe. It will introduce the charges in January 2022 for customers who joined or upgraded their contracts after 7 July 2021. There will be 30-day packages available for people travelling for longer periods. Vodafone has three types of tariff: Its cheapest sim-only deals do not allow any use apart from emergency calls outside the UK and Ireland Some of its more expensive Xtra plans include roaming at no extra charge The rest of its tariffs offer roaming for Â£2 a day. Eight-day and 15-day passes are available for Â£1 a day. EE to reintroduce Europe roaming charges Vodafone to bring back roaming charges from January Three brings in EU roaming charges Virgin Mobile and O2 users will not face EU roaming charges All four of the big operators previously said they had no plans to introduce roaming charges. Whether or not your operator is imposing extra charges, there are ""fair use limits"" on the amount of time that customers will be allowed to use their phones abroad. UK customers have been told that their operators will charge extra if they spend more than half their time overseas, generally measured by being in another country for more than 62 days in a four-month period. That could have happened while the UK was still part of the EU, but some operators have only just started enforcing it. Similarly, data limits are also subject to fair use restrictions. Customers of O2 have a monthly data limit of 25GB and will be charged Â£3.50 for each GB after that. Vodafone's limit is also 25GB with a Â£3.13 charge per GB after that. Three has cut its fair use limit from 20GB a month to 12GB and will charge Â£3 per GB above that. The planned Â£2-a-day fees are still relatively small compared with the costs customers had to pay before the EU banned roaming charges. In the past some people returned from European trips to face bills for hundreds or even thousands of pounds. The UK's trade deal,externalwith the EU said that both sides would encourage operators to have ""transparent and reasonable rates"" for roaming. The UK government also passed legislation to provide some safeguards for consumers: A Â£45-a-month limit on the amount they could be charged for using mobile data abroad before having to opt into further use Requirements for customers to be informed when they have reached 80% and 100% of their data allowance Operators also have to take ""reasonable steps"" to avoid customers being charged for accidental roaming in Northern Ireland, which could happen if a phone there locked on to a mobile signal coming from the Republic of Ireland Without the EU rules in place, the charges levied depend on agreements between UK operators and their counterparts in EU countries. Both sides may have seen this as an opportunity to make some money both from UK customers visiting EU countries and EU customers coming to the UK. The four main operators in the UK declined to comment on the commercial deals they have with other operators. The UK governmentrecommends that customers check the details of their individual tariff,externalwith their phone operator before travelling.

Pell argues 'irregularity' in abuse verdict,"George Pell is the most senior Catholic cleric to be convicted of sexual abuse Cardinal George Pell is challenging his child sexual abuse conviction on three grounds, including saying that the trial had a ""fundamental irregularity"". The ex-Vatican treasurer abused two boys inside a Melbourne cathedral in 1996, a jury found in December. Pell maintains his innocence. His lawyers argue that he was wrongly prevented from entering his plea before a jury, according to court documents which have been republished by Australian media. The defence team also argues that the jury's verdict was ""unreasonable"" because it relied too heavily on one person's testimony. Last year, a court heard that Pell had abused two 13-year-old boys following a mass in 1996, when he was archbishop of Melbourne, A jury unanimously convicted him on one charge of sexually penetrating a child under 16, and four counts of committing an indecent act on a child under 16. The trial heard testimony from one of the victims. The other died of a drug overdose in 2014. Pell was remanded in custody on Wednesday and is due to be sentenced on 13 March. Pell guilty of child sexual abuse Poisoned power at the top Why his conviction was kept a secret The case has rocked the Catholic Church, where Pell was considered one of Pope Francis's closest advisers. On Thursday, footage of Pell responding to the allegations for the first time - during a police interview in Rome in 2016 - was released by a court. This video can not be played Pell called abuse claims against him 'disgraceful rubbish' Details of the case had been kept secret from the public until this week for legal reasons. Pell's lawyers argue that the verdict relied on the surviving victim's evidence, saying ""it was not open to the jury to be satisfied beyond reasonable doubt"". The jury had heard ""unchallenged"" evidence from 20 other prosecution witnesses, the defence team said. The second aspect of the appeal asserts that the trial judge had wrongly prevented an animation from being played at the trial. The final challenge concerns the alleged jury procedural error. ""There was a fundamental irregularity in the trial process, because the accused was not arraigned in the presence of the jury panel as required,"" said lawyer Paul Galbally.

Woman's conviction for killing husband overturned,"Sally Challen admitted killing her husband but denied murder A woman who killed her husband in a hammer attack after saying she suffered decades of abuse has won an appeal to have her murder conviction quashed. Sally Challen, 65, of Claygate, Surrey, admitted killing 61-year-old Richard in August 2010 but denied murder. She will now face a retrial. She was convicted in June 2011 and ordered to serve a minimum of 22 years,later reduced by four years on appeal. Lawyers had asked the Appeal Court to reduce her conviction to manslaughter. During the two-day hearing, the court heard evidence relating to Mrs Challen's state of mind at the time of the killing and the issue of ""coercive control"". Coercive control describes a pattern of behaviour by an abuser to harm, punish or frighten their victim and became a criminal offence in England and Wales in December 2015. Mrs Challen's murder conviction was overturned by three judges who said the evidence of a psychiatrist, that Mrs Challen was suffering from two mental disorders at the time of the killing, was not available at the time of her trial and undermined the safety of her conviction. Sally and Richard Challen had two sons and had been married for 31 years Mrs Challen, who appeared at the appeal via video-link from HMP Bronzefield in Ashford, was visibly emotional as she was told of the decision. Relatives and supporters in the public gallery cheered and applauded. Mrs Challen, whose name is Georgina but is known as Sally, will face a retrial on a charge of murder after the panel of judges refused to substitute a manslaughter conviction. The two-day hearing followed a campaign by her sons David, 31, and James, 35. Speaking outside the Royal Courts of Justice, David said: ""It's an amazing moment. The courts have acknowledged that this case needs to be looked at again, as we have always said as a family. ""The abuse our mother suffered, we felt, was never recognised properly and her mental conditions were not taken into account. ""Her sons will get another shot for the events that led to our father's death to be heard, and for our mother to have another shot at freedom."" By Helena Lee, BBC News, Court of Appeal Such was the interest in the case that by mid-morning on the first day Lady Justice Hallett, one of the three senior judges on the panel, asked for a bigger courtroom so more people could get in. Although Sally Challen wasn't there in person those in the courtroom could see her on screens via video-link from prison. When it was time for the judgement her supporters waited anxiously. They erupted in cheers as Lady Justice Hallett said Mrs Challen's murder conviction would be quashed. Then there was silence as a retrial was announced. Her son David wept. His mother cried too.

Gap to shut shops and hive off Old Navy,"Fashion firm Gap Inc has announced it is shutting 230 stores and splitting off its Old Navy brand, a restructuring aimed at ""revitalising"" the company. It emerged as new figures revealed that like-for-like sales at Gap continued to fall while Old Navy's revenue rose. Old Navy will be a standalone company while a new business, which is yet to be named, will house Gap as well as its other brands including Banana Republic. Gap Inc said the closures would mainly be in North America. The firm said it had already closed 68 of its eponymous stores, leaving 742 Gap stores globally. It is not yet clear how many jobs will be lost. It is part of a strategy to ""revitalise"" the brand, and generate more of its sales online, which it hopes will reach 40% of total revenues. Once a by-word for cool, sporty, casual wear, and promoted through high-profile advertising campaigns fronted by the likes of Madonna and rapper Missy Elliott, Gap's popularity among the young and fashionable has waned. Missy Elliott and Madonna fronted a Gap advertising campaign in 2003 Cheaper fast-fashion brands such as Zara, H&M and Forever 21 now attract younger shoppers and Gap's sales have been falling in recent years. In its latest financial results, Gap Inc said that like-for-like sales at its namesake stores fell by 5% over both the fourth quarter and the full year. Same store sales were flat for Old Navy in fourth quarter but rose by 3% over 12 months. Christina Boni, vice president at Moody's, the rating agency, said: ""Old Navy is Gap Inc.'s leading brand comprising 47% of sales in 2018 with margins that lead its portfolio. ""Old Navy continues to outpace Gap Brand and Banana Republic and is one the fastest-growing major apparel brands with comparable stores of 3% in 2018 growing to over $7.8bn in 2018."" However she cautioned that spinning off Old Navy ""reduces the diversification the brand provides to the overall entity"". In the fourth quarter, operating profit fell to $372m from $396m on sales marginally lower at $4.6bn.

How Bin Laden's neighbours' lives changed forever,"Bin Laden's compound in 2012, before it was completely demolished Al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden was killed in Abbottabad, Pakistan in a dramatic and bloody raid by US Navy Seals on 2 May 2011. Five years on the BBC's M Ilyas Khan finds loose ends, unsettling and unanswered questions, and a neighbourhood changed forever. The open spaces that once surrounded the sprawling compound are fast disappearing. When I first saw it, just hours after al-Qaeda's leader-in-hiding was killed, it was an open and quiet suburban lane. Now new houses - small, box-shaped, concrete - have come up and it has the feel of an ill-planned and crowded neighbourhood. But the view opens up as you venture further down the street to where the tall walls of the compound once stood. That was all razed, just months after his killing. Bin Laden's death: How it happened Legacy of Bin Laden's death The compound has now been completely razed Fragments of the concrete beams from his home are strewn about. A small pipe jutting out of the ground continues to spout water, as if a natural spring even though it is actually connected to a deep well that once pumped drinking water to the Bin Laden household. The water is now used by neighbours in an area where shallow well water is brackish and not everyone can afford deep drilling. Bin Laden's drinking water is now used by his neighbours This well is located in what was the Bin Laden compound What is unchanged is the memory of the event - which rocked Abbottabad and the entire world in May 2011 - and the measures some still take to avoid discussing it. A construction worker who worked on the compound agreed to see me when I assured him we wouldn't reveal his identity.  But when I reached his home, there was a padlock on his door. A neighbour said he took his children out the previous night. One man will talk. ""They would tie our hands, blindfold us"" Zain Baba, 84, has the distinction of being the first, and closest neighbour of the Bin Ladens. His small house was across the street. Every morning he comes out and sits under a huge maple tree, a sort of assembly point for the retired men of the neighbourhood. Until that night, he and his son Shamrez Khan worked as night watchmen for Arshad Khan, an ethnic Pashtun who lived in the compound with his family and that of his brother. To the Americans, Arshad Khan was the same man as Abu Ahmed al-Kuwati, the Kuwait-born courier of Bin Laden, whose phone calls apparently led them to the hideout. Life goes on in Bin Laden's old neighbourhood Zain Baba and his son had access to some parts of the compound. They were picked up by Pakistani intelligence after the raid and kept in custody for two months. ""They would tie our hands, blindfold us and take us for long drives from one place to another. They wanted to know if we saw Osama in the compound. We kept telling them that we didn't see anyone except the two brothers and some children."" Zain Baba and his friends meet daily under a maple tree Five years later, he is still on the security radar. When foreign journalists come to the area, they want to talk to him, he says. ""Men in plain clothes riding government vehicles"" drop by to ask questions about the visitors, and to warn him against ""talking to such people"". He recounts how a French journalist who interviewed an aged neighbour of his was recently escorted away by security officials. The old man they had interviewed died later that night. The next day the men in plain clothes came to see Zain Baba and asked him about the whereabouts of his son, Shamrez. ""I am tired of people asking questions. I don't want to give any more interviews to the media. Even when the media speak to someone else, the security people come asking for me."" He has a wryness about him and a fatalistic approach, but ultimately no true fear. He believes little can happen to him now - it is a situation that tells more about the paranoia of the security agencies than his safety. The gate to Shakil Rafiq's home was shut - and he was nowhere to be found Shakil Rafiq is a changed man. He used to be an amiable and responsive man who mixed with his neighbours. ""He now walks with his head down, and if someone shouts a greeting at him, he just responds by waving a hand,"" says one neighbour. A small-time construction contractor, Mr Rafiq's business picked up after he was employed by Arshad Khan to supply labour and material for the construction of the Bin Laden compound. Mr Rafiq's life changed a few years later, after the US raid. Security agents raided his house and took him away. A neighbour who witnessed the arrest said the street was taken over by men in plain clothes and Mr Rafiq was escorted out carrying a shoulder bag. Soldiers cleared debris from Bin Laden's compound after the US raid in May 2011 A security official who was part of the post-raid investigations says Mr Rafiq was picked up after it was found that various facilities were registered in his name. He didn't return for several months. In the intervening years, Mr Rafiq has disappeared several times for varying durations, the latest being just a few months ago, say neighbours and local journalists. He did not respond to several attempts by the BBC to contact him. One neighbour said: ""Every time he walks out carrying a shoulder bag, it's a sign that he is going to be away for a while. Where exactly? Nobody knows."" A US helicopter crashed near the compound during the US raid Did policeman Yasir Khan know more than he ought to? Did he have direct links with residents of the compound? Nobody will know. He was posted to Abbottabad's police intelligence department back in May 2011, and did not live far from the compound. He was often seen hanging around in the area in plain clothes, sniffing for information like all spies do, says one senior security source. His colleagues say he was at home around midnight on 2 May, when the Americans destroyed one of the helicopters that crashed during the raid. The sound of the blast alerted police, and Mr Khan was one of several officials called to respond. The next day he was picked up by men in plain clothes. Dozens were taken away after the raid He is among dozens of people taken away by men in plain clothes after the raid. He is the only one who has not yet returned.  A security official says he was alive until a year ago, but did not say where he was being held, or by which intelligence service. His family never speak to the media, but their pain is not hidden from their neighbours. His mother is still alive and he has a wife and children still clueless about his fate. Unusual but not extraordinary. That was how police interpreted the midnight blast of 2 May 2011. Abbottabad is a garrison town, and a  helicopter crash, though rare, could be expected, explains a police officer who was among the first police officials who entered the compound. The compound was closely guarded in the days following Bin Laden's death (file photo) ""In the dark, we couldn't make out if the burning helicopter was Pakistani or American."" They found women and children crying and shouting. The compound was soon taken over by the military and the police couldn't probe the matter any further. He remained part of the military-led investigations, but will not share those details. ""It was an embarrassing moment. We could neither admit nor deny that Osama was here. Our best option was to not to say anything."" But staying silent on the matter has not helped the ghost of Bin Laden leave the town. ""There is a continuing state of alert in Abbottabad,"" he says. What was on Bin Laden's bookshelf? Osama Bin Laden evaded capture for nearly a decade The implications of that night resonated well beyond this neighbourhood.  Would Bin Laden be turning in his grave over the way al-Qaeda has gone? Could he have changed things? It has been increasingly overshadowed by the so-called Islamic State in many parts of Africa and the Middle East. In the Afghanistan-Pakistan region - which is the original birthplace of militant Islam - al-Qaeda continues to have links with local groups but appears to be more of one-among-equals now. Many say that al-Qaeda is more decentralised, with regional groups acting independently of the central leadership. This could be partly because the leaders are not as militarily experienced, ideologically articulate or charismatic as Bin Laden was, and hence cannot inspire the same loyalty. But it could also simply be the changed security environment. In pictures: Osama Bin Laden's life Bin Laden files: Seven things we learned It was the fact that Bin Laden's home was spitting distance from a prime military academy that led to speculation about the lack of, or the extent of, Pakistani complicity. It has been a huge embarrassment for the Pakistani military, which literally runs the country's security policy - and so the response of officials has been silence. They have also kept  tight vigil over those connected to the compound to prevent them from passing on any information to the media or ""foreign agents disguised as journalists"", as one official put it. Pakistani and US officials have publicly said that Pakistani authorities were not aware of Bin Laden's presence in Abbottabad, but many have contrary views. American journalist Seymour Hersch argues Bin Laden had been in Pakistani custody since 2006 and was killed after the country struck a deal with US. Part of his argument is the ability of US helicopters to fly nearly 200km over Pakistani territory to get Bin Laden, and fly back, without being interrupted. A screenshot of a video seized from Bin Laden's compound, released by the US, shows a man identified as Bin Laden watching President Barack Obama on TV If true, then this ""prisoner"" also had enough freedom totravel around in the tribal regionuntil as late as May 2010, as the BBC discovered on good authority. Official circles and independent analysts here say that while the Pakistani government could not possibly have had any knowledge of Bin Laden's whereabouts, that a handful of top officials in some powerful quarters may have known cannot be ruled out. Either way, the events of a small block of this mountain town five years ago not only changed the lives of those unlucky enough to be his neighbours, but also marked a moment with massive implications for the world as we know it.

Social media firms 'must tackle grooming',"Sex offenders are grooming children on Instagram more than on any other online platform, a charity has found. Police in England and Wales recorded 1,944 incidents of sexual communication with children in the six months to September 2018, the NSPCC said. Instagram was used in 32% of the 1,317 cases where a method was recorded, Facebook in 23% and Snapchat in 14%. Instagram and Facebook said they ""aggressively"" fought grooming, while Snapchat said it was ""unacceptable"". Following pressure from campaigners,sexual communication with a child,externalbecame an offence in April 2017. In the 18 months that followed, more than 5,000 online grooming offences were recorded by police, according to the data gathered by the NSPCC. How can I keep my kids safe online? The charity said the figures did not ""fully reflect the scale of the issue"", as many crimes went undetected or unreported. Where the police logged age and gender, seven out of 10 victims were girls aged 12 to 15. One in five was aged 11 or under. The youngest victim was five years old. The NSPCC said 39 of the 43 police forces in England and Wales responded to Freedom of Information requests, with only Surrey, Sussex, Northampton and City of London police failing to provide data. The children's charity is calling for new laws to force social media firms to do more to protect children. In one case of abuse given by the charity, a girl was groomed by a 24-year-old man when she was 13. Emily - not her real name - met the man through a friend. He had introduced himself, saying he was 16, which quickly changed to 18. She told him she was 13. Later that evening he added her on Facebook and Snapchat. Emily said: ""It escalated very quickly from there. We exchanged texts which quickly became sexual, then photos and videos before arranging for him to come and pick me up after school. ""He drove me somewhere quietâ¦ and took me into the woods and had sex with me. He drove me in the direction of home straight afterwards, refusing to even talk, and then kicked me out of the car at the traffic lights. ""I was bleeding and crying. This was my first sexual experience."" Emily's mother said: ""We felt as though we had failed as parents - we knew about these social media sites, we thought we were doing everything we could to ensure our children's safety when they were online, but we still couldn't protect Emily."" NSPCC chief executive Peter Wanless accused social media networks of ""10 years of failed self-regulation"". ""These figures are overwhelming evidence that keeping children safe cannot be left to social networks. We cannot wait for the next tragedy before tech companies are made to act,"" he said. CBBC's 8 top tips for staying safe online Ahead of the government publishing a delayed white paper on online harm, the charity is pushing for statutory regulation to enforce a legal duty of care to children on social networks, with a penalty of substantial fines if they fail. A National Crime Agency spokesperson said: ""It is vital that online platforms used by children and young people have in place robust mechanisms and processes to prevent, identify and report sexual exploitation and abuse, including online grooming. ""Children and young people also need easy access to mechanisms allowing them to alert platforms to potential offending. A spokesperson for Facebook, which also owns Instagram, said keeping young people safe was its ""top priority. ""We use advanced technology and work closely with the police and CEOP [Child Exploitation and Online Protection] to aggressively fight this type of content and protect young people."" Dating apps 'must not risk child safety' Fortnite predator 'groomed children in-game' Train firm in overcrowding pledge,external A Snapchat spokesperson said the exploitation of any member of its community, especially a young person, was ""absolutely unacceptable"". ""We go to great lengths to prevent and respond to this type of illegal activity on our platform,"" they added. The platform recommends young people keep their privacy settings restricted, do not share their username publicly and do not add people they do not know as friends. A spokesperson from the Home Office said both the home secretary and culture secretary had ""engaged tech firms about their responsibilities towards protecting people"". Last year the home secretary announced a Â£250,000""innovation call"",externalfor organisations to help develop new ways to disrupt the live streaming of abuse.

Tesla drives down price for Model 3,"Tesla has not said how many stores will be closed Tesla has announced it will start selling a version of its Model 3 in the US at a price of $35,000 (Â£26,400), finally delivering on a promise it made more than two years ago. To help lower the price the firm plans to close showrooms and is switching to an online-only sales model. The electric car company announced the Model 3 car in 2016 as an alternative to its luxury offerings. However, as recently as September, the average selling price exceeded $50,000. Shares in the company were down 8.4% to $292.97 on Friday, the day after the announcement. Closing physical stores will allow the firm to cut costs by about 5%, savings it is using to reduce prices across its line-up of vehicles, chief executive Elon Musk said. He declined to say how many stores would close, or how many people will lose their jobs as a result of the move, but said making the change was necessary as Tesla works toward its bigger goal of making electric cars mainstream. Tesla currently has 378 stores and service locations worldwide. Elon Musk tweet faces legal challenge Tesla reports profit as issues stabilise The weird and wonderful life of Elon Musk The Model 3 electric car has a range of 220 miles, a top speed of 130 mph and 0-60mph acceleration of 5.6 seconds. More than 400,000 customers signed up for the car when it was first announced, but production issues, higher prices and other delays caused troubles following its launch. Over the last year, the firm has shrunk the Model 3 battery, tweaked its manufacturing process, and reduced costs in other ways to hit the lower price, while still protecting profit margins. Mr Musk said he was not worried that a shift to online-only sales would put off customers. The firm already has a much smaller physical presence in the US than most other car companies. In a blog post, Tesla said,externala test drive was not needed because you can return a car within seven days, or after driving 1,000 miles, and get a full refund. ""Quite literally, you could buy a Tesla, drive several hundred miles for a weekend road trip with friends and then return it for free,"" the blog said. The company is confident that will not happen often. Tesla's website said cars ordered now would be ready for delivery in two to four weeks' time. However, customers with orders already in queue will get priority, which could delay some deliveries until June, Mr Musk said. The lower-priced model is expected to be available for order in Europe and China in three to six months' time. Tesla has already announced thousands of job cuts since June, as it tries to balance its books after years of losses. Strong sales of the Model 3 are critical to that effort. The firm managed to scrape a profit in the final two quarters of 2018, but Mr Musk said it expected to post a loss for the first three months of this year. ""It has been insanely difficult,"" Mr Musk said, referring to delivering on the $35,000 price promise. Delivering a car for $35,000 - about the average cost of a new vehicle in the US - is a ""potential game changer"" for Tesla's growth, said Daniel Ives, a managing director at Wedbush Securities. ""While there are still questions that need to be answered around logistics and delivery... we believe this strategic shift was the right move at the right time for Tesla,"" he wrote in a note. Coinciding with the price drop, Tesla is also bringing back its ""full self-driving"" feature after it removed it in October, following criticism it was overstating the autonomy of its cars. Tesla is now offering two software packages; regular autopilot, at a cost of $3,000 (Â£2,270) which will allow for automatic steering on highways or full self-driving ($5,000) which takes over more functions, such as changing lanes, navigating junctions and taking exits. According to chief executive, Elon Musk, the self-driving software will get an upgrade later this year which will allow it to navigate in more complex city environments. If you've ever wondered how those enormous Tesla stores in fancy shopping centres make money, well, they don't. At least, they don't make enough money for Tesla to keep them all open if it also wants to be able to afford to produce a $35,000 car - a car its investors (and many customers) have been desperately waiting for since it was announced way back in March 2016. The hope is that this is the car that brings a Tesla into the affordability zone for a whole new type of customer. It's still an incredibly expensive car for almost all of us, but for a luxury electric vehicle this is new ground. The Tesla brand, and its ramped up production capabilities, make it likely the cheap(er) Model 3 will turn out to be a popular proposition. But Tesla's admission it would not, as it had previously said, turn a profit this quarter, has spooked investors - as has admitting it needs to lay off workers and scale back its bricks-and-mortar presence in order to make good on a long-held promise is of concern. Coupled with his SEC woes lingering overhead, Mr Musk hasn't exactly lost his investors' confidence, but he hasn't exactly filled them with it either.

YouTube bans comments on all videos of kids,"YouTube says it will switch off comments on almost all videos featuring under-18s, in an attempt to ""better protect children and families"". Several brands stopped advertising on YouTube after discovering that paedophiles were leaving predatory comments on videos of children. YouTube had originally disabled comments on videos that were attracting predatory and obscene comments. But it will now disable comments on almost all videos of minors by default. It said the change would take effect over several months. TheBBC first reported that paedophiles were leaving explicit commentson YouTube videos back in 2017. As well as leaving obscene or sexual comments, they were also using the comments section to signal content of interest to other paedophiles. At the time, YouTube said it was ""working urgently"" to clean up the site. However, in February this year advertisers including AT&T, Nestle and Hasbro suspended their ads after more predatory activity was found. In a blog post,external, YouTube said its new policy meant videos of very young children would automatically have the comments section disabled. The move is likely to include videos of toddlers uploaded by parents, as well as short films featuring children by established YouTube stars. Videos of older children and teenagers will typically not have the comments disabled, unless a specific video is likely to attract predatory attention. That could include, for example, a video of a teenager doing gymnastics. YouTube told the BBC it would use algorithms to detect which videos contained children. Millions of hours of footage are uploaded to YouTube every day. A small number of YouTube content creators will be allowed to enable comments on videos featuring children. These channels will be trusted partners such as family video-bloggers or known YouTube stars. However, they will be required to actively moderate their comments and demonstrate that their videos carry a low risk of attracting predatory comments. AT&T and Hasbro pull YouTube ads over abuse claims Predatory comments prompt YouTube ad suspension YouTube said it had developed a system that was better at detecting predatory comments and removing them. Previously, it had said it would stop video-makers earning ad revenue if paedophiles left explicit comments on their videos, but this will no longer be necessary. In addition to updating its comments policy, YouTube said it had terminated several channels that were ""endangering"" children. The ban included several channels that were adding shocking content in the middle of children's cartoons. It named FilthyFrankClips as one of the banned channels. It had released a video instructing children how to cut themselves. ""Nothing is more important to us than ensuring the safety of young people on the platform,"" said YouTube chief executiveSusan Wojcicki on Twitter,external. YouTube's app for children - YouTube Kids - has been criticised for using algorithms to curate content. Inappropriate videos have repeatedly been discovered on the service. The comments left by fans on YouTube videos help the platform's algorithms decide which videos to serve up and recommend to viewers. Creators have expressed concern that being forced to disable comments on their videos will affect the growth of their channels. Despite the wide-ranging new policy, comments will remain part of the recommendation algorithm. ""We understand that comments are an important way creators build and connect with their audiences,"" YouTube said in a statement. ""We also know that this is the right thing to do to protect the YouTube community."" Andy Burrows from the child protection charity NSPCC said the announcement was an ""important step"". ""We know that offenders are twisting YouTube videos for their own sexual gratification, using them to contact other predators and using the comments section as shop window to child abuse image sites,"" he said. However, he called for an ""independent statutory regulator"" that could ""force social networks to follow the rules or face tough consequences"".
