UK gas prices fall from high after Russia steps in,"UK wholesale gas prices hit a record high before falling after Russia said it was boosting supplies to Europe. Russia President Vladimir Putin appeared to calm the market after gas prices had risen by 37% in 24 hours to trade at 400p per therm on Wednesday. UK gas was 60p per therm at the start of the year, but high global demand and reduced supply has driven prices up. The high cost of wholesale gas has seen several UK energy firms collapse and halted production across industries. Following Mr Putin's comments on supplies, gas prices dropped to about 257p a therm later on Wednesday. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the changing gas prices underlined the ""volatility in the market and the nervousness amongst investors about low stockpiles of gas across Europe"". ""When Putin's promises help calm the storm of rising prices which was pummelling financial markets, it's clear investors are desperate for any gust of good news blowing in,"" she said. Why are your energy bills going up? Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? What's CO2 used for in food and drink? The surge in prices led to Energy Intensive Users Group, which represents steel, chemical and fertiliser firms, calling on the government to help keep businesses and industries running. Industry leaders said surging costs had already resulted in steel production halting ""at times of peak demand"". Last month, US-owned CF Industries shut two UK sites that produce 60% of the country's commercial carbon dioxide supplies because of the rise in gas prices, before the government stepped in to meet its operating costs for its Teesside plant for three weeks. The shut down led to a shortage of carbon dioxide - a by-product of the fertiliser factories - which sparked warnings from food producers and supermarkets of shortages in the supply of fresh produce. The gas is to stun animals for slaughter and in packaging to prolong shelf life. ""We have already seen the impact of the truly astronomical increases in energy costs on production in the fertiliser and steel sectors,"" said Richard Leese, chairman of the Energy Intensive Users Group. ""Nobody wants to see a repeat in other industries this winter, given that UK EIIs [energy intensive industries] produce so many essential domestic and industrial products and are intrinsically linked with many supply chains."" A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""We are determined to secure a competitive future for our energy intensive industries and in recent years have provided them with extensive support, including more than Â£2bn to help with the costs of energy and to protect jobs. ""Our exposure to volatile global gas prices underscores the importance of our plan to build a strong, home-grown renewable energy sector to further reduce our reliance on fossil fuels."" Besides industry struggles, a total of nine energy suppliers have collapsed in recent weeks, which has affected nearly 1.73 million customers in September alone. The companies that have gone bust have been mostly smaller firms, which have been unable to deliver price promises to customers because of the surge in gas prices. Firms going bust has also had a knock on effect to auto-switching services, with Look After My Bills, famous for its popularity on BBC Two's Dragon's Den, ""pausing"" its operations, and fellow auto-switching company Flipper closing down completely. Flipper said in a statement that it had withdrawn from the market and was closing because it could ""no longer sustain the great savings"" its customers had ""come to expect"". Meanwhile, Look After My Bills said it was ""temporarily pausing"" its switching service, but would be ""back as soon as we can"" access energy deals ""right"" for customers. Affected customers have been told they will be switched to a new tariff by energy regulator Ofgem and be contacted by their new supplier. It has advised people to take a meter reading and to wait until a new supplier has been appointed before looking to switch to another energy firm. Jonathan Brearley, the boss of Ofgem, has warned that the cost of protecting customers from failing energy providers could lead to higher bills. A higher energy price cap came into force on Friday, with those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, seeing bills go up by Â£139 to Â£1,277 a year. Customers are protected from sudden hikes in gas prices through the energy price cap, which sets maximum prices and charges for those on a standard or default tariff. However, the next revision of the cap, which will affect bills from the start of April, is likely to rise significantly to reflect the greater costs faced by suppliers. Analysts at energy consultancy Cornwall Insight have predicted the next cap will mean the typical household will have an annual bill of Â£1,600 and the impact of the crisis could be felt into 2023. ""The explosion of choice and innovation seen in the sector in the last decade by challenger suppliers has been fundamentally altered in a matter of months, and while all eyes will inevitably be on this winter, the need for an enduring solution to ensure that the gains experienced by almost three decades of competition are not lost,"" said its senior consultant, Craig Lowrey.

Businesses welcome back workers as furlough ends,"The wave of job cuts many expected at the end of the furlough scheme has not happened, early data suggests. The number of redundancies proposed by employers in September was close to record lows. Many businesses with large numbers of furloughed workers say they have taken everyone back, and unions had not heard of major redundancy processes. Around one million workers were thought to be on furlough when the scheme ended. Covid: What impact has the furlough scheme had? The furlough scheme, where government paid a proportion of workers' wages when their employers couldn't, ended in September after 18 months. There were concerns that many employers would not be able to pay their workers' wages when the scheme ended, and would have to cut jobs. However, the number of firms planning redundancies was still close to record lows in September. Just over 200 firms in Great Britain informed the government of plans to make redundancies in September, with a total of 13,836 jobs at risk. This was a slight increase on August, but far below the levels seen last summer, and among the lowest numbers seen in data which stretches back to 2006. These figures don't include smaller firms, because employers are only obliged to notify government when making 20 or more jobs redundant. Nonetheless the fact that they file at the start of the process gives an early indication of how the labour market is developing. Other evidence also suggests that the number of job losses as a direct result of the end of furlough was lower than had been feared. The Community, CWU, GMB, Prospect, Unite and Usdaw trade unions had not received news of any major redundancies among their members when contacted by the BBC this week. Google searches for 'redundancy' - another early indicator of possible job losses - showed a small increase at the end of September, but it was still less than a quarter of the levels seen at the worst of the pandemic last summer. ""With estimates of actual redundancies and of real-time online searches related to redundancy both lower than before the pandemic, it looks like the worst is well and truly behind us now on job losses,"" said Tony Wilson, director of the Institute of Employment Studies. Around a million people were thought to be on furlough by the time the scheme ended, of whom around half were working part-time and partly furloughed, according to estimates from the Resolution Foundation think-tank. What are my rights if I am made redundant? How do I find a new job and who is hiring? The BBC contacted the 31 employers which claimed Â£1m or more in June, the most recent month for which official figures have been published. None told the BBC they were making significant numbers of redundancies, though some declined to comment or failed to reply. Many of the big users for the furlough scheme were airlines and air travel businesses, as international travel is still far below pre-pandemic levels. British Airways was the biggest user of the scheme, claiming over Â£10m in June. It had brought all its furloughed workers back by the end of September. Airlines were among the biggest users of the furlough scheme Other major scheme users Easyjet, Jet2, Ryanair, Tui, Virgin Atlantic, Hays Travel, Airbus, delivery firm DHL, air traffic controller NATS, baggage handler Swissport, plus Gatwick, Heathrow, Manchester and Stansted airports all told the BBC they are not making redundancies because of the end of the furlough scheme. Virgin Atlantic chief executive Shai Weiss wrote on LinkedIn that ""the furlough scheme has been crucial to Virgin Atlantic and many other companies throughout the pandemic, helping us to protect as many jobs as possible."" Travel firms have already shed thousands of jobs in the early months of the pandemic. With a number of travel restrictions lifted in recent weeks, and more to expected soon, many in the industry are optimistic that further job cuts will not be necessary. Outside the travel industry, J D Wetherspoon and Travelodge said they had already brought all their furloughed workers back in the summer. However, some the workers returning from furlough may have to work part-time for a while, if firms don't have enough work to keep them busy full-time. And workers at smaller employers may not be so fortunate as those at larger companies. ""Six in ten furloughed workers were at firms with less than 20 employees,"" said Samuel Tombs, chief UK economist at Pantheon Macroeconomics. ""I do worry about the capacity of those firms to bring back staff on a full-time basis."" What impact has the furlough scheme had? Where are all the job vacancies?

Why are energy bills going up?,"Gas and electricity bills are going up again on 1 January, when the latest energy price cap takes effect. Customers are encouraged to submit a meter reading to ensure they are charged the correct amount. The energy price cap covers 26 million households in England, Wales and Scotland and is setevery three months,externalby the energy regulator Ofgem. It fixes the maximum price that can be charged for each unit of energy on a standard - or default - tariff for a typical dual-fuel household which pays by direct debit. Between 1 January and 31 March 2025,gas prices will be capped at 6.34p per kilowatt hour (kWh), and electricity at 24.86 per kWh.,external This means the annual bill for a dual-fuel direct debit household using a typical amount of energywill go up to Â£1,738 per year, an increase of Â£21 from the previous cap. Those who pay their bills every three months by cash or cheque will pay Â£1,851. Analysts at forecaster Cornwall Insight, which tracks the energy market, expect prices to fall slightly in April and October 2025, but says thathigh domestic energy prices are likely to be ""the new normal"". The cap does not apply in Northern Ireland, which has its own energy market. Your energy bill depends on the overall amount of gas and electricity you use, and how you pay for it. The type of property you live in, how energy efficient it is, how many people live there and the weather all make a difference. The Ofgem cap is based on a ""typical household"" using 11,500 kWh of gas and 2,700 kWh of electricity a year with a single bill for gas and electricity, settled by direct debit. The vast majority of people pay their bill this way to help spread payments across the year. Those who pay every three months by cash or cheque are charged more. Energy prices could vary at different times of day Submitting a meter reading when the cap changes means you will not be charged for estimated usage at the wrong rate. This is especially important when prices go up. Customers withworking smart metersdo not need to submit a reading as their bill is calculated automatically. Fixed-priced deals offer certainty for a set period - often a year, or longer - but if prices drop, you could be stuck at a higher price. Ofgem says customers who want the security of a set price should consider fixed deals. However, it recommends getting independent advice. The price comparison site Uswitch says it is important to check whether fixed deals have exit fees before signing up and to make sure you fully understand the terms of the contract. Because the price cap changes every three months, it is difficult to know with any certainty whether a fixed tariff is a good deal. The longer the fixed term, the greater the uncertainty. Between January and March, households on prepayment meters will pay slightly less than those on direct debit, with a typical bill of Â£1,690, a rise of Â£21 from the previous quarter. About four million households had prepayment meters in April 2024, according to Ofgem. Many have been in place for years, but some were installed more recently after customers struggled to pay higher bills. Rulesintroduced in November 2023,externalmean suppliers must give customers more opportunity to clear their debts before switching them to a meter. They cannot be installed at all in certain households. Energy firms pay out over force-fitting of meters Standing charges are a fixed daily fee to cover the costs of connecting to a supply. They are typically 61p a day for electricity and 32p a day for gas, although they vary slightly by region. Under the energy price cap, they have risen by 43% since 2019. Campaigners argue standing charges are unfair because they make up a larger proportion of the bill of low energy users. Ofgem has proposed thatenergy firms must provide a choice of price-capped tariffsfrom winter 2025, one which has a standing charge and unit rate - as is the case now - and another with no standing charge but a higher unit rate. Customers would be able to choose which suits them best. Separately, it wants a consistent approach from suppliers on how to deal with unpaid bills totalling Â£3.8bn. Changes to the winter fuel payment mean more than 10 million pensioners are not receiving the money this winter. Previously, it was paid to all pensioners in England and Wales born before 25 September 1957. However, in July, the government said future payments would be made only to those on low incomes who receivedcertain benefits, including pension credit. The 2024 payment - worth Â£200 or Â£300 depending on individual circumstances - is paid automatically to eligible pensioners. However, hundreds of thousands of people who are entitled to pension credit do not claim it, which means they will miss out on the winter fuel payment too.

Johnson vows to get on with job of rebuilding UK,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson says he wants a ""high-wage, high-skill, high-productivity, and low tax economy"" Boris Johnson has promised to ""get on with the job"" of uniting and levelling up the UK, in a speech to the Conservative Party conference. In an upbeat address peppered with jokes, but light on new policy, the prime minister claimed a high-wage, high-skilled economy was being created in the wake of Brexit and the pandemic. He also defended tax rises to pay for the NHS and vowed to fix social care. The 45-minute speech was his first to a conference since the pandemic began. In it, the prime minister said the overwhelming Conservative general election victory in 2019 placed an onus on his government to deliver change demanded by voters. The main theme of his speech was ""levelling up"", with the PM saying that reducing gaps between regions would ease pressure on south-eastern England, while boosting places that felt left behind. Kuenssberg: Will UK's problems burst the PM's balloon? Five things we learned at Tory conference Boris Johnson's conference speech fact-checked Â£3,000 promised for maths and science teachers He also repeated pledges set out at during his party's conference this week in Manchester to crack down on crime, improve transport links and broadband, and reform the housing market. And he sought to reassure Tories anxious about plans to increase National Insurance to pay for the NHS and social care by claiming it was what predecessor Margaret Thatcher would have done, if the economy had been hit by a ""meteorite"" like the pandemic. ""She would have wagged her finger and said that more borrowing now is just higher interest rates and even higher taxes later,"" he said. Boris Johnson is an optimist. The prime minister wants a new economic model with better pay and conditions. He wants to persuade voters his is the party to distribute wealth and opportunity more evenly across the UK. He wants people to feel good about the future. Levelling up has been the slogan repeated by ministers at this conference. We only got a sliver of meat on the bones today. This was a speech thin on policy, big on jokes and rhetorical flourishes. Conservatives love Mr Johnson because he makes them feel good - it's a strategy that is key to understanding his success as a politician. But will it be enough? There are some difficult months ahead for many people. Rising prices, supply chain issues, the end of the universal credit top-up and furlough. Many Conservatives acknowledge the cost of living squeeze - and are worried about the impact. Critics will accuse the prime minister of ignoring those big issues in favour of what they see as vague promises for the future. But the hope in Manchester was that Boris Johnson's unflinchingly upbeat vision of a post-Brexit, post-pandemic Britain is as popular with voters as it is with Tory activists. The Conservative conference has taken place amid concerns over rising inflation, supply chain problems, and petrol and worker shortages. But Mr Johnson insisted that the present problems were the result of an economic rebound in the wake of Covid shutdowns. He added that controls on immigration represented the ""change that people voted for"" in the 2016 Brexit referendum, while also promising to end declining home ownership among young people by building more housing. He announced a Â£3,000-a-year bonus for teachers, as an incentive for struggling areas of England to recruit maths and science specialists. The policy replaces a similar nationwide scheme that has recently been phased out. Downing Street said the new ""levelling up premium"" would cost Â£60m, but no details have yet been given over which areas will qualify. This video can not be played New Tory MPs talk 'levelling up' ""There is no reason why the inhabitants of one part of the country should be geographically fated to be poorer than others,"" Mr Johnson said. ""You will find talent, genius, flair, imagination, enthusiasm - all of them evenly distributed around this country. But opportunity is not."" Mr Johnson referred to Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, who was recently photographeddancing in an Aberdeen nightclub,as ""Jon Bon Govi"" - an allusion to the rock star Jon Bon Jovi. He also mocked Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, whom he has frequently dubbed ""Captain Hindsight"". ""If Columbus had listened to Captain Hindsight, he'd be famous for discovering Tenerife,"" he joked. But Sir Keir accused Mr Johnson of ""playing this game where he's pretending that he's just sort of just landed from the Moon and he's looking around and saying, 'Things look pretty awful around here, we need a bit of levelling up, things are so awful'"". He told ITV's Peston programme: ""He and the Tories have been in government for 11 years, so we're in this state because of the way that they have governed the country."" The CBI business lobby group said Mr Johnson said set out a ""compelling vision"" but had so far ""only stated his ambition"" on raising wages. Shevaun Haviland, who heads the British Chambers of Commerce, said firms supported the aim of a higher-wage, higher-skill economy but warned: ""This will not happen overnight.""

Energy bills could rise by hundreds of pounds,"High energy costs are forcing manufacturers to warn of higher prices for their goods as they pass on increases to consumers. Iceland boss Richard Walker said higher energy bills and other costs meant price rises were now ""inevitable"". The warning came as analysts predicted that household energy bills could rise by hundreds of pounds next year. They said the energy price cap, which protects domestic consumers, could soar by Â£400 in the spring. Cornwall Insight forecasts that the energy price cap will rise to about Â£1,660 by next summer. That is about 30% higher than the record Â£1,277 level for the cap set for winter 2021-22, which began at the start of October. ""With wholesale gas and electricity prices continuing to reach new records, successive supplier exits during September 2021 and a new level for the default tariff cap, the Great British energy market remains on edge for fresh volatility and further consolidation,"" said Craig Lowrey, senior consultant at Cornwall Insight. Energy regulator Ofgem said the price cap ""will ensure that consumers don't pay more than is absolutely necessary this winter"". But if gas prices stay high, the price cap will rise, Ofgem said. The regulator said its ""number one priority is to protect customers"", but acknowledged ""this is a worrying time for many people"". What can I do if my energy supplier goes bust? Energy price cap: Why are fuel bills rising? UK gas prices fall from record high after Russia steps in But while the price cap helps households, there is no such safeguard for businesses, which have to absorb the full impact of rising global energy prices. Mr Walker warned that Iceland's energy bill would go up by Â£20m next year. Alongside higher salaries to address lorry driver shortages and other new costs, he said grocery prices would have to increase. ""It's inevitable that we will see price rises,"" he told the BBC. ""The UK supermarket industry is one of the most competitive in the world. ""Our margins are very very tight and we're not an endless sponge that can just absorb all of these different cost increases."" Andrew Large, director general of the Confederation of Paper Industries, said: ""This is a highly inflationary situation for the British economy and members will clearly be in a position where they do try to pass those costs on to consumers where they can."" One paper manufacturer, the Northwood Group, said the industry had been ""left to fend for itself"" in the face of ""horrendous"" knock-on effects from the gas price rise. ""The spike [in gas prices] that we have seen since January is equivalent to a 550% price increase, which of course destroys any industrial planning,"" said chairman Paul Fecher. Laura Cohen, chief executive of the British Ceramic Confederation, said many of her member firms could even be forced to stop production ""due to uneconomic higher energy costs"". This could cause ""severe damage"" to production facilities such as brick kilns, which could not easily be turned off at short notice, she said. Meanwhile, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has said that by decarbonising the UK's power supply, the country will protect customers from volatile fossil fuel prices. ""The UK so far, as many of you know, has made great progress in diversifying our energy mix. But we are still very dependent, perhaps too dependent, on fossil fuels and their volatile prices,"" he told a conference organised by trade body Energy UK. He said that the government's recent pledge to decarbonise the electricity grid by 2035 - 15 years ahead of the previous target - would help. ""Our homes and businesses will be powered by affordable, clean and secure electricity generated here in the UK, for people in the UK,"" Mr Kwarteng said. The Energy Shop - a price comparison site - warned people to prepare themselves for even greater increases in household bills. It said that the next increase in the price cap, due to come in from 1 April 2022, could be Â£500 or even higher. Founder Joe Malinowski warned: ""If things don't settle down soon, increases of Â£600, Â£700 or even Â£800 cannot be ruled out."" Nine energy suppliers have already collapsed in recent weeks and more could be facing the same fate. They were unable to keep their price promises as the wholesale price of gas soared. Their customers have already seen annual bill increases of hundreds of pounds when they moved to a new provider and away from whichever low-rate fixed deal their supplier had offered. Some of the heat was drawn from the crisis on Wednesday when Russia said it would increase gas supplies to Europe. UK wholesale gas prices hit a record high during the day before falling after the Russian intervention. But price volatility could continue as investors remain nervous about low stockpiles of gas across Europe. If you feel powerless against international business and politics when watching your domestic energy bill go up, you are in good company. Normally, customers are urged to get active, search and switch to save money - but not now. Until recently, the energy price cap was a backstop, protecting the vulnerable. Now it is the most competitive tariff available. The cap is shielding households from the wild fluctuation in prices seen on the wholesale markets, but that is only a crumb of comfort when bills and prices across the board are still expected to see a sharp increase. So for now, experts simply advise customers to find ways to save energy, brace themselves and budget for bigger bills. Wrap up for a financial chill that could last longer than the winter. The energy price cap sets the maximum price suppliers in England, Wales and Scotland can charge customers on a standard - or default - tariff. That includes the fixed daily amount customers pay, plus the price per unit they pay for electricity and gas. The cap was increased on 1 October, with about 15 million households facing a 12% rise in energy bills, the biggest jump, to the highest amount, seen since the backstop was introduced in January 2019. Those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, saw an increase of Â£139 - from Â£1,138 to Â£1,277 a year. Prepayment meter customers with average energy use saw a Â£153 increase. That's a far cry from a year previously when on 1 October 2020, the energy price cap was cut by Â£84, to Â£1,042.

Johnson's speech fact-checked,"Boris Johnson has given his first in-person speech to the Conservative Party conference since the Covid pandemic struck. Promising ""radical and optimistic conservatism"" he made claims about the economy, wages, and housing - and repeated some familiar pledges. We've looked at some of them. The G7 is a group of big economies. UK GDP, a measure of everything produced in the country, grew 5.5% between April and June, compared with the first three months of the year, and he's right - that is more than any other G7 country. Butthe UK economy was hit particularly hard by the pandemic,which means it takes more growth to get back to where we started. If you take a longer view, the picture looks less rosy. If you compare GDP between April and June 2021 with the last three months of 2019, before the pandemic hit, the UK had the joint-fifth best growth in the G7, equal with Germany, and with only Italy doing worse. It's not clear what constitutes a ""new"" hospital, as the pledge Mr Johnson is talking about includes refurbishments of existing hospitals. The plan is for them to be built by 2030, so this is still a work in progress. So far, construction has begun at six sites. One is a new cancer centre on an existing hospital site in Bath. The other five were hospital builds planned under pre-existing schemes (over the last decade) and include building work that stopped after the collapse of the construction firm Carillion. The Conservatives promised 50,000 more nurses for England by March 2025. The latest figures show there were 310,251 full-time equivalent NHS nurses and health visitors in June 2021. While that is up 14,158 since December 2019, it still leaves 35,842 full-time equivalent posts to fill over the next three-and-a-half years. You can read more about how the Conservatives are doing withmeeting some of their manifesto pledges here. He's right that deals have been done with 68 countries plus the EU, but there's a big caveat. Nearly all of these deals - 63 of them in fact -are ""rollover"" deals.That means they copied the terms of deals the UK already had when it was an EU member, rather than creating any new benefits. Deals with Japan and with Norway, Iceland and Liechtenstein are slightly different than the EU deals they replace, and the UK has also agreed in principle a free trade deal with Australia, which the EU has not. But by far the most important agreement - the one with the EU itself - creates additional barriers to trade which were not there when the UK was part of the EU single market, particularly for services. And the big Brexit hope of an early free trade deal with the United States has not been fulfilled. Did Brexit speed up the UK's vaccine approval? Brexit: Is the EU stopping the UK having free ports? Mr Johnson gave this example while talking about the need to ""level up"". The Office for National Statisticsproduces life expectancy data,externalat a regional and local level. Its latest figures show that that life expectancy at birth for males in Blackpool is 74. That compares with 81 in Ribble Valley - so on this measure, Mr Johnson is right. For females, life expectancy at birth is 79 in Blackpool and 84 in Ribble Valley. The suggestion that Labour has a policy to decriminalise hard drugs is not true. The party has confirmed that it does not support this. We asked the Conservatives for the source of the prime minister's claim. They pointed us toan interview from last month,externalin which Keir Starmer was asked about ascheme in Scotlandto give people caught with Class A drugs a police warning. Scottish Labour supported this. In the interview, the Labour leader said: ""It is not unusual in any legal system for those caught with a small amount of cannabis not to be prosecuted... there is a world of difference between that and saying 'do you think the drugs laws should be scrapped?' - to which my answer is 'no'"". Asked whether he welcomed Scotland's decision, which was about Class A drugs and not cannabis, he said it was ""probably the right thing to do"" but was an ""independent decision"". The prime minister has made this claim before -we checked it in April. The figure he has used in the past is the number of net additional dwellings in England, which was 243,770 between April 2019 and March 2020. That was a record for the last 30 years. But that's not just homes built - net additional dwellings is a broad definition reflecting new houses completed, plus gains or losses from conversions, changes of use and demolitions, and even some caravans and houseboats. It should also be said that very few of the new homes are being built by the government - 82% of the completions were from private enterprise, 17% from housing associations and 1% from local authorities. Other indicators suggest that the figures for 2020-21 will have been considerably reduced by the pandemic when they are released in November. In the three months to March 2020, the average salary was worth 1% more than it had been a year before. The most recent figures, for April to July 2021, estimate that the average salary was worth 4.5% more than a year before. Since average salaries dipped in the first few months of the pandemic, comparing this July with last July looks like a record rise - but more because of lows back then than highs right now. Work and Pensions Secretary Therese Coffey said the figures had been ""skewed and distorted"" and described recent average earnings rises as a ""statistical anomaly"". And as a result, the government decided, for this year, to break their manifesto pledge to increase pensions by at least as much as wage growth. While the most recent figures exaggerate the growth in wages,Office for National Statistics analysis,externalthat tried to strip out the distortions suggests that Mr Johnson was probably correct. Prices have been rising in recent months, which is likely to eat into wage increases, while many in the public sector have had their pay frozen. You can read more about what has been going on with wages here. Correction: The figure for Q2 GDP growth was changed to take account of the second estimate from the ONS.

"Council tax bills could rise by Â£220, IFS warns","Council tax in England could rise by as much as Â£220 per year within three years, researchers have said. This is to keep local services running and help pay for social care reforms, the Institute for Fiscal Studies (IFS) think tank said. It comes amid warnings that councils continue to face severe funding pressures due to the pandemic and must find new sources of income. The government said it had given them Â£12bn since the start of the crisis. Under current government spending plans, council tax bills will need to rise by at least 3.6% a year just to keep services running at pre-pandemic levels, the IFS said. That would mean bills would have to rise by Â£160 by 2024-25, it said. But extra cost pressures that eat into central government grants could easily push up council tax by 5% a year, or Â£220 by 2024-25, it said. Social care changes at-a-glance Covid: What is council tax and should it go up in the pandemic? In addition,the government's plans for social care, which include capping costs, won't be completely paid for by a planned rise in National Insurance contributions, the IFS said. The plans are likely to cost Â£5bn per year eventually, it said, nearly three times the funding currently allocated. The government has made much of the idea that after decades of governments neglecting the increasingly pressing issue of underfunded social care, this was a nettle it was determined to grasp. What's concerning in the IFS report is who might get stung. A large part of the goal of the social care reforms was to address unfairness in the means-testing system. But the IFS report highlights the risk that, without further funding, it could create new unfairness elsewhere. To extend publicly-funded care to those who've spent Â£86,000 of their own money on fees will cost extra, and local authorities may only be able to recoup that by tightening eligibility criteria - so many poorer people lose access. Second, the way the funds are allocated to local authorities dates back to 2013. Because some areas like Blackpool have seen their populations fall, but others, like Tower Hamlets have seen them jump since then, the risk is that the money won't go where it needs to. IFS research economist Kate Ogden said: ""The government has stepped up with billions in additional funding for councils to support them through the last 18 months. ""It is likely to have to find billions more for councils over the next couple of years if they are to avoid cutting back on services, even if they increase council tax by 4% a year or more."" She said that the coming financial year is ""likely to be especially tough"", with ongoing Covid-19-related pressures and squeezes on budgets She added that the local government funding system was ""hopelessly out of date"", being based on 2013 population levels, leading to ""unfairness"" in the distribution of resources between councils. Council tax goes towards funding local services such as policing, the fire service and street cleaning. The funding is topped up with grants from central government and business taxes. However, these central government grants were slashed between 2009-10 and 2019-20, especially in areas such as public transport, housing and planning. The Local Government Association said councils ""continue to face severe funding and demand pressures that will stretch the local services our communities rely on to the limit"". ""The significant financial pressures facing local services cannot be met by council tax income alone,"" said LGA chairman James Jamieson. ""Councils are particularly alarmed that the government's solution for tackling social care's core existing pressures appears to be solely through the use of council tax, and the social care precept."" Mr Jamieson called for local services to be ""the top priority"" in the upcoming Spending Review. A government spokesperson said: ""The government has allocated more than Â£12bn directly to councils since the start of the pandemic - with more than Â£6bn available to spend as they see fit - recognising that councils are best placed to deal with local issues. ""We have also taken historic action to fix the social care crisis - the Health and Social Care Levy will raise Â£12bn a year to fund the NHS and social care. ""The Spending Review will continue to focus on supporting jobs and delivering the public's key priorities.""

Nestle has supply chain issues ahead of Christmas,"The maker of Quality Street and Lion bars has said it is experiencing some supply chain problems ahead of the Christmas period. But Mark Schneider, the chief executive of Nestle, told the BBC that it was working hard to make sure products made it on to shelves this winter. A number of sectors have had problems with their supply chains due to a chronic shortage of HGV drivers. Factors including global bottlenecks with shipping have also played a part. ""Like other businesses, we are seeing some labour shortages and some transportation issues but it's our UK team's top priority to work constructively with retailers to supply them,"" he said. When asked whether he could guarantee Quality Street would be in the shops this Christmas he replied: ""We are working hard."" Nestle, which also makes Aero and KitKat, is the world's largest producer of dairy products - and works with hundreds of thousands of farmers around the world with millions of cows. Ahead of a major climate summit in Glasgow next month, chief executive Mark Schneider was in the UK to launch a range of non-dairy, plant-based alternatives to its milk and chocolate in an attempt to further reduce the company's greenhouse gas emissions. Agriculture accounts for 20% of the world's greenhouse emissions and methane from belching cows is a major contributor. Along with new non-dairy products, Nestle is also working with new types of feed for cattle that produce less methane per litre of milk produced. Mark Schneider said Nestle was working hard to overcome supply chain issues ahead of Christmas Mr Schneider also admitted it was responding to the commercial reality of a market that has seen consumers - particularly those who are younger and more affluent - move away from dairy products to oat and soya-based alternatives. ""We think less meat and dairy is good for the planet, but it's also good for diet and health, and it is also a big commercial opportunity,"" Mr Schneider said. He said that these alternative products would cost more than their dairy equivalents at first but that the cost would come down over time. ""The first unit is always going to be a little more expensive, this is a hump you have to get over, and then at some point economies of scale kick in making them more affordable as we have seen in electric cars. ""Some consumers are willing to pay a premium now for products that pave the way for that,"" he said. Lack of examiners blamed for HGV driver shortage What's happening about petrol shortages?

Misconduct notices issued over Plymouth shootings,"Five people were shot and killed in the Keyham area of Plymouth A member of police staff has been issued with a gross misconduct notice over their handling of Plymouth gunman Jake Davison's application for a shotgun certificate. Davison shot and killed five people in Keyham, Plymouth, on 12 August. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said the certificate was returned to Davison weeks before the killings. A second person - a police officer - has received a misconduct notice. The misconduct notice relates to the handling of two assaults in 2020 admitted by Davison. Maxine Davison, 51, Stephen Washington, 59, Kate Shepherd, 66, Lee Martyn, 43 and three-year-old Sophie Martyn, were all killed by Davison before he turned the gun on himself. The IOPC is investigating how the apprentice crane operator was originally granted a shotgun certificate in 2017 by Devon and Cornwall Police. The watchdog is also examining how Davison was handed back the weapon and certificate weeks before the shooting - having been seized after admitting the two assaults on youths in a park in September 2020. Davison was placed on a voluntary intervention programme following the assaults - an alternative to being charged or cautioned. His shotgun and licence were not seized for another three months until concerns were raised directly with the police by a member of staff working on the intervention programme. In July, Davison was given back his shotgun, which he used for clay pigeon shooting, and his certificate. Lee Martyn and his daughter Sophie were both killed in the attack The IOPC said it was investigating whether the police officer ""shared information appropriately with the force Firearms and Explosives Licensing Department"" regarding the violent offences, and whether they ""took appropriate steps to seize the shotgun certificate, shotgun, and ammunition"". The watchdog said ""the serving of such notices advises individuals that their conduct is subject to investigation, but does not mean that disciplinary proceedings will necessarily follow"". It added that it hoped to complete its investigation into Devon and Cornwall Police's decision-making in relation to Davison's possession of a shotgun and shotgun certificate, by the end of the year. David Ford, IOPC regional director, said his organisation was reviewing ""a substantial amount of information gathered from Devon and Cornwall Police and elsewhere"". He said: ""Based on the evidence gathered so far, we have now served disciplinary notices on two individuals within the force to advise them their conduct is subject to investigation."" Maxine Davison, the gunman's mother, was named by police as his first victim Devon and Cornwall Police Assistant Chief Constable Jim Nye said the force was ""fully cooperating"" with the investigation. He said: ""We acknowledge that the IOPC has served a police officer with a misconduct notice and a staff member with a gross misconduct notice, in relation to their involvement with Jake Davison. ""The force is supporting our staff through this process."" Follow BBC News South West onTwitter,external,Facebook,externalandInstagram,external. Send your story ideas tospotlight@bbc.co.uk,external.

Prince Andrew to receive Epstein-Giuffre agreement,"Virginia Giuffre, then Roberts, was pictured with Prince Andrew in London in 2001 Prince Andrew has been granted access to a sealed document his lawyers believe could help end the sexual abuse case being brought by Virginia Giuffre. A US judge gave permission for the agreement between Ms Giuffre and convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein to be shared with the prince's lawyers. Ms Giuffre's lawyers had made the offer to release the document but believe it will be ""irrelevant"" to the civil case. The Duke of York, 61, has consistently denied Ms Giuffre's allegations. Ms Giuffre, 38, claims she was sexually assaulted by the prince at three locations including New York City. Prince accepts being served with US lawsuit papers Post, courier, e-mail - the saga to serve papers on Andrew Andrew B Brettler, who represents Prince Andrew, had argued at a previous hearing that Ms Giuffre had entered into a ""settlement agreement"" with Epstein that would end her current legal action, During the first pre-trial hearing of the case last month, Prince Andrew's lawyer said the agreement ""releases the duke and others from any and all potential liability"". The prince's lawyers have said in court that Ms Giuffre agreed in 2009 not to sue anyone else connected to Epstein when she settled her damages claim against the billionaire sex offender, who died in prison in 2019. The precise wording of that deal is currently confidential - sealed by a court. In a court document filed on Wednesday, US Judge Loretta Preska agreed to a request from Ms Giuffre's lawyer, David Boies, to provide the duke's legal team with the document. Mr Boies previously said about the document: ""Although we believe that the release is irrelevant to the case against Prince Andrew, now that service has been accepted and the case is proceeding to a determination on the merits, we believe that counsel for Prince Andrew have a right to review the release and to make whatever arguments they believe appropriate based on it."" Then known as Virginia Roberts, Ms Giuffre claims she was assaulted by the prince at the London home of Epstein associate Ghislaine Maxwell, and at Epstein's homes in Manhattan and Little Saint James, in the US Virgin Islands. Her case claims Prince Andrew engaged in sexual acts without Ms Giuffre's consent, including when she was 17, knowing how old she was, and ""that she was a sex-trafficking victim"". The prince has consistently denied the claims and, in 2019, told BBC Two's Newsnight programme: ""It didn't happen.""

Tory who missed Covid pass vote was at conference,"Gareth Davies was newly elected at May's Senedd elections A Conservative politician who missed a crucial vote on compulsory Covid passes in nightclubs and big events in Wales was at the Tory conference in Manchester at the time. Gareth Davies says he was ""angry"" that he was unable to access the Welsh Parliament's remote voting system. But the Senedd's Presiding Officer Elin Jones said he had been given ""every opportunity to be present"". His absence meant Welsh ministers won by one vote. Elin Jones had said on Tuesday that she had provided her personal phone number to allow Mr Davies to vote. The Night Time Industries Association called for the decision to be taken again, but that was not echoed by any of the Senedd's party groups. Under the new law evidence of full vaccination or a negative Covid test within 48 hours will be required when visiting nightclubs or large events. Health Minister Eluned Morgan has said the vote will not be re-run. The Conservative Party conference has been taking place in Manchester The Senedd, because of the Covid pandemic, is sitting in a hybrid session where MSs can attend in person or take part via Zoom. It had not been clear, initially, where Mr Davies had been at the time of the decision. Then, around Wednesday lunchtime, the Vale of Clwyd politician said he was ""working and representing the group at the Conservative Party conference and I would have been able to vote remotely if I'd have been able to access the remote voting tools"". ""I am deeply upset, frustrated and angry at last night's events and my inability to cast a vote against vaccine passports,"" he said. He said concerns have been raised with the Senedd's ICT department. What is a Covid pass and how do I get one? Covid pass breaches 'should not be police priority' Sturgeon apology over Covid passport app launch However BBC Wales was told attempts had been made by the Senedd to contact Mr Davies but ""no one could get hold of him"" - a Tory source said that was because he was speaking to the chief whip Darren Millar and staff. One MS said that just before the vote Elin Jones read out a phone number to the Tory chief whip for Gareth Davies to call her on. Darren Millar had told Ms Jones there were difficulties with getting one of his members onto Zoom. ""Elin waited for a phone call. The phone didn't ring,"" the MS said. They added that Ms Jones then offered Mr Davies another 30 seconds to get in touch before eventually deciding to proceed. At the time of the vote on Tuesday evening Ms Jones said: ""We are holding the vote please, and we have made every opportunity possible for that... member to get in, including sharing my personal phone."" She later added: ""It is a member's responsibility to give themselves sufficient time to secure their Zoom connection in time for voting, just as it is for any member travelling to the Senedd to vote."" On Wednesday she declined to give Mr Davies a chance to make a personal statement to the Senedd, saying as he had shared it with the media it was already in the public domain. Mr Davies later put the statement on Facebook, saying he was not able to call the presiding officer: ""I was already on a call at that time frantically speaking with Welsh Conservative staff members in an attempt to solve the ICT problems."" With the whole opposition against the plans, and Labour controlling only half of the Senedd's 60 seats, if Mr Davies voted there would have been a tie. The new law would have failed to pass as a result. Mandatory Covid passes are being introduced this coming Monday in Wales Asked about holding a re-run of the vote, Eluned Morgan told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers that that is ""not how democratic processes work"". ""You don't keep on having a vote until you get the answer that you want,"" she said. ""Actually this is a system that's been in place for about four months already. People have been using it throughout the summer. ""What we know is that the people of Wales want to be protected."" ""We had a huge mandate as a result of the election because of our cautious approach."" Conservative Monmouth MS Peter Fox told the programme that a re-run ""would be a difficult thing to do"". ""Democracy has a set of processes, and you have to follow them and, you know, sometimes you don't like the outcome of the decision or the circumstances in which you've created a decision. ""But democracy is what it is and if you start eroding that where are you ending up?"" Following the vote the Welsh Conservatives called for the ending of the hybrid arrangements. But there was frustration in the party outside of the Senedd group of Tories. Tory councillor David Fouweather, of Newport, tweeted that the Conservative group should have got their whip ""sorted"", adding: ""Letting Wales down. Abolish the assembly."" Plaid Cymru's health spokesperson Rhun ap Iorwerth also rejected a re-vote. Analysis by BBC Wales political reporter Adrian Browne Parliaments, and governments, are generally reluctant to re-run votes because doing so can open a huge can of worms. Do so on this occasion and it's not hard to imagine politicians routinely queueing up for a re-vote on this or that issue, conjuring up ingenious, or not so ingenious, arguments as to why. The Senedd authorities insist there was no failure on their part to allow every Senedd member a fair chance to vote on Covid passes, and therefore there is no case for a re-match. This was down to a particular Conservative member, Gareth Davies, not doing what he needed to do to vote, they say. Mr Davies, of course, disputes this. Mistakes when voting do happen from time to time, by the way, but tend to go unnoticed by the world at large because there are usually no significant consequences. However, fifteen years ago the Labour Welsh health minister of the day, Brian Gibbons, caused great amusement bypressing the wrong button,externaland, with help from a party colleague who failed to vote with Labour, accidentally backed an an inquiry into the state of the Welsh Ambulance Service. That vote stood and all the indications are that this one will too.

"Estranged husband hid in bedroom to murder wifeTamara Padi was stabbed multiple times in her bedroom by her estranged husband, who lay in wait.Manchester","Aubrey Padi was ordered to serve a minimum of 23 years An estranged husband who hid in his wife's home then stabbed her to death in the night has been jailed. Tamara Padi was ""brutally"" stabbed multiple times in her home in Stalybridge, Tameside, in July in an ""incomprehensible"" attack. Aubrey Padi, of Carrfield in Hyde, pleaded guilty at an earlier hearing to murdering his 43-year-old wife. The 46-year-old was jailed for life at Manchester Crown Court and ordered to serve a minimum of 23 years. Greater Manchester Police (GMP) said the couple split in February. On 7 July, Padi let himself into his wife's home in the early hours and lay in wait for her arrival. She arrived home shortly after 01:30 BST with a friend who was staying over. The friend, who was sleeping downstairs in the living room, was woken at about 03:30 by screaming from upstairs, police said. Tamara Padi was described as a ""happy and outgoing soul"" who was ""loved by everyone"" Ms Padi's friend saw her estranged husband attempt to flee out of the front door but then he turned around, went back upstairs and stabbed Ms Padi multiple times. He then told the friend to call 999 and left the property. Ms Padi was taken to hospital but died shortly after arriving. Ms Padi was described as ""happy and outgoing soul"" who was ""loved by everyone"", in a family tribute after her death. A friend also paid tribute, saying Ms Padi was ""full of love and made sure everyone around her felt that love"". Det Insp Lee Shaw said: ""This was a brutal attack on someone that this man had vowed to love and care for.

"Peer renews call for vote on benefit boost endThe Â£20-a-week top-up to universal credit was always meant to be temporary, the government says.UKComments","This video can not be played Universal credit: What Â£20 means to me A Conservative peer who helped design the universal credit system has renewed her call for a vote on the end of the Â£20-a-week top-up to the benefit. Baroness Philippa Stroud said it was a ""really bleak day"" for many families as the extra money is withdrawn from Wednesday. But the new justice secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC the top-up was always meant to be temporary. Extending the booster paymentwould cost around Â£6bn a year. The government has said that spending has to be brought under control after unprecedented emergency interventions during the pandemic. Mr Raab defended the withdrawal of the booster payment, insisting the government wanted to ""avoid the benefits and welfare trap"" and universal credit was designed to encourage people back into work. He pointed out the Â£400bn ministers put into helping the economy, workers and the most vulnerable was ""clearly unsustainable"" in the long-term. But the government has continued to help jobless people find work, he added, citing theÂ£4.3bn stimulus package unveiled by the chancellor last year. Mr Raab told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""What we've done - national living wage, personal allowance, the ending of the over-reliance on cheap labour from abroad which depresses wages - is so critical to our vision for the economy."" Universal credit reduction: 'I feel overwhelmed' Universal credit: End of the Â£20 boost explained 'Eviction risk' for universal credit renters Universal credit is a benefit for working-age people and was brought in to merge six benefits - such as income support and child tax credit - into one payment. It can be claimed whether a person is in or out of work and is drawn by more than 5.8 million people in England, Scotland and Wales - with almost 40% of them classed as being in employment. The benefit is made up of a standard allowance - whichdiffers according to age and personal circumstances,external- plus any additional amounts that apply, such as having children, a disability or health condition that stops someone from working. A Â£20-a-week increase to universal credit was brought in as a temporary measure to help those on low incomes hit financially by coronavirus lockdowns. The extra universal credit payment works out as about Â£87 a month, or Â£1,040 a year. The scheme is officially due to end on Wednesday, but the exact date the money will stop being paid will vary depending on the day a person usually receives their universal credit. You can read morehere. Baroness Stroud, who is chief executive officer of the Legatum Institute think tank, told the same programme that their calculations showed the withdrawal of the top-up would push 840,000 people into poverty - including 290,000 children. ""There are people who are out of work who will move back into work, but there are also 450,000 who will move into poverty today as a result of this who have disabilities or who have children who are disabled,"" she said. Baroness Stroud reiterated her call for a cross-party House of Lords vote on the decision to remove the Â£20-a-week top-up ""that would say to the House of Commons, think again on this issue"". She previously told the BBCshe would table an amendment to the Social Security Billwhen it reached the House of Lords, but this has not yet happened. Nicola Flower says the Â£20 booster payment helped pay for heating during her cancer treatment For Nicola Flower, from Cornwall, the uplift in universal credit has helped her stay warm by paying for heating bills during her cancer treatment. She told the BBC she has had to shield for a year due to the coronavirus pandemic and is still waiting for an operation. ""I had no choice but to go on it [universal credit],"" she said. ""It was a godsend because I wouldn't have managed otherwise. I have never been on benefits before in my life. I have always done three jobs."" Nicola, who worked as a seamstress, in a supermarket and as a cleaner, said the she knew the Â£20 uplift was ""an extra"", but added with fuel prices and gas prices rising, she could do with the money. You can read morehere. Campaigners, charities, and MPs have called for the top-up to be made permanent to help those who are still struggling. The Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) has urged the government to continue the uplift, saying food banks are struggling to support ""ever-increasing"" numbers of people. The network - which represents 500 UK food banks and providers - says it is ""running out of options"" as volunteer numbers and public donations have dropped, food supply shortages have caused problems, and staff are already stretched to meet current demand. Earlier this week the homelessness charity Crisis warned that about100,000 renters could face eviction when the Â£20 booster payment ends. The Labour party accused ministers of being ""complacent about the cost of living crisis""amid concerns over rising energy prices and the end to the top-up in universal credit. Its shadow business secretary Ed Miliband warned the end to the booster payment risked ""plunging"" people into fuel poverty. Paddy Lillis, general secretary of the shopworkers union Usdaw, said: ""It is shameful the government is removing this crucial lifeline for low-paid workers and their families; particularly as they face rising utility bills and national insurance increases, along with fuel and food shortages that are impacting the cost of living."" He urged the prime minister to ""do the right thing"" by cancelling the withdrawal of the universal credit top-up and ""committing to reforming a social security system that doesn't provide the support working families need"". But the government has insisted the uplift to universal credit was always meant to be temporary and designed to help people through the toughest stages of the pandemic. It added that higher wages, rather than taxpayer-funded benefit rises, would be the best way to tackle poverty as the country emerged from Covid restrictions. How are universal credit rules changing?

"Teen died in short and brutal attack, court hears","Keon Lincoln died in hospital after he was shot and stabbed in Birmingham in January A 15-year-old boy was murdered outside his home in a ""short and brutal"" attack, a trial has heard. Keon Lincoln died after he was set upon by a group of youths on Linwood Road, Handsworth, Birmingham, on 21 January. He was repeatedly stabbed by a group who got out of a stolen car and chased him, before being shot in the stomach as he lay on the ground, Birmingham Crown Court was told. Five defendants, aged between 14 and 18, deny murder. It is alleged the gunman was the 14-year-old defendant, who cannot be named for legal reasons. Opening the case for the prosecution, Michael Burrows QC told jurors there must have been a motive for the attack but he could not say ""precisely what it was"". He said the incident was captured on CCTV and showed five people involved in the attack: ""They all wore their hoods up so their faces could not be seen. ""The CCTV shows one of the individuals had a gun and shot at Keon Lincoln twice. One of the shots hit Keon Lincoln in the stomach and caused fatal injuries."" Mr Burrows added: ""The prosecution say the gunman was... and is 14 years old. As I understand, he disputes that he was present and was the gunman."" The 14-year-old is alleged to have lied to police by claiming he spent part of the day logged on to online school lessons, but records showed he did not attend any lessons after logging on at 08:30 GMT. The alleged gunman was arrested a week later and said he knew of Keon but ""they had never fallen out"". He also told police that he had gone to a friend's house and watched television until about 23:00 before booking a taxi home, but Mr Burrows told the jury: ""He gave the phone number for the phone he said he had used to book the taxi. ""There is no record of that number being used to book a taxi."" Keon Lincoln died in hospital about two hours after the attack The prosecutor said the CCTV footage showed the other attackers were armed with large knives, with which Keon was stabbed repeatedly. Keon died in hospital about two hours after suffering eight sharp force injuries and an injury to a major artery. ""As I understand, they each dispute that they were present,"" Mr Burrows told the court. The ""short and brutal"" attack lasted about 30 seconds, Mr Burrows told the court, continuing even after Keon tried to get up and run away. Mr Burrows told the jury: ""He [Keon] was shot at whilst he was on the ground,"" adding the group continued ""hacking at him with large knives"". The court heard a vehicle, which had been stolen and was on false plates, later crashed in Wheeler Street, Birmingham, where forensic evidence including a hunting knife was recovered. ""Plainly, it's obvious this attack was planned,"" Mr Burrows said. (L-R) Tahjgeem Breakenridge, Kieron Donaldson and Michael Ugochukwu are on trial alongside two youths who cannot be identified ""In short, the prosecution say, when you consider all the evidence from the CCTV and phone records, it is clear that these defendants are those shown in the CCTV, and that they were all involved in the murder of Keon Lincoln."" Michael Ugochukwu, of Twyning Road, Edgbaston, Tahjgeem Breakenridge, of Oldfield Road, Balsall Heath and Kieron Donaldson, of Aston Lane, Perry Barr, all aged 18, are on trial, alongside two youths aged 14 and 16, who are from Birmingham and Walsall respectively. Mr Donaldson, the court heard, is not alleged to have been present at the scene of the attack but to have ""helped and supplied weapons"". Latest updates from the West Midlands As well as the murder charge, the 14-year-old defendant denies possessing a handgun with intent to endanger life. Mr Breakenridge, Mr Ugochukwu and the 16-year-old also deny unlawful possession of a knife. The trial continues. Follow BBC West Midlands onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external.

Family praise 'hero' who tried to save bomb victim,"John Atkinson was not assessed by paramedics for 47 minutes, the inquiry heard The family of a care worker killed in the Manchester Arena attack have praised ""heroic"" efforts by a member of the public to try and save him. John Atkinson, 28, was one of 22 people who died when a bomb was detonated in the arena foyer on 22 May 2017. Members of the public and police helped him but he was not assessed by paramedics for nearly 50 minutes. The public inquiry has previously heard he may have survived had he been given medical treatment more quickly. It has been looking at the individual circumstances of the deaths of each victim, who were killed when Salman Abedi detonated a device at an Ariana Grande concert. Mr Atkinson, from Radcliffe in Bury, was 20ft (6m) away from Abedi when the bomb went off and was separated from the friend he had attended the concert with. The inquiry heard CCTV footage showed that within five seconds of the blast Mr Atkinson crawled on his hands and knees across the floor of the foyer. A member of the public, Ronald Blake, phoned 999 within 52 seconds of the blast and used a belt as a tourniquet to try and stem the bleeding from Mr Atkinson's leg. Mr Blake, who was injured himself and had no first aid training, stayed with Mr Atkinson for nearly an hour holding the tourniquet the entire time, the inquiry heard. John Cooper QC, representing Mr Atkinson's family, told Mr Blake: ""I profoundly thank you on their behalf for the hard work, dedication and heroics you performed on that night trying to save John."" Ronald Blake used a belt as a tourniquet and held it on John Atkinson's leg for nearly an hour Mr Blake said Mr Atkinson was conscious and talking while they were together and he was ""shocked"" to discover the next day, when he was being treated in hospital for his own injuries, that he had died. Giving evidence, he told the inquiry: ""I have never had any first aid training and my natural instinct at the arena was to try and stop the blood and keep him conscious. ""When I left him with the paramedics I thought he was going to survive."" Mr Blake replied ""yes"" when Mr Cooper asked him: ""During the time you were dealing with John it was obvious, wasn't it, that he was very, very severely injured?"" Bomb victim spent last moments laughing and joking Nurse felt helpless in Arena bomb aftermath PCs thanked for 'heroic efforts' after Arena bomb The inquiry heard it was more than 45 minutes before anyone came to help lift Mr Atkinson out of the foyer and down the stairs to the casualty clearing station at the adjoining Victoria railway station. British Transport Police constable Jessica Bullough, who assisted Mr Atkinson, said: ""We realised that no-one was coming to help us and so it was better to get people downstairs."" A decision was made to grab a display board to carry Mr Atkinson out of the foyer, the inquiry heard. However, a metal barrier then needed to be fetched as the board was too ""flimsy"" and would not fit in a nearby lift. Twenty-two people were killed in the May 2017 bombing The inquiry heard PC Leon McLaughlin asked North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) incident commander Dan Smith for a stretcher to carry Mr Atkinson down the stairs. PC McLaughlin said he felt he was ""ignored"" and told by Mr Smith to ""blanket him up"" and ""leave him there for now"". The officer said he felt ""frustrated"" but said it was ""clear that they were not going to move from where they wereâ¦.and provide me with any meaningful help"". The inquiry heard only three NWAS paramedics entered the foyer on the night, two of them just a few minutes before Mr Atkinson was evacuated. On the available footage Mr Atkinson was not triaged, assessed or assisted by NWAS personnel for the 47 minutes he was in the room, the hearing was told. The hearing has been told the issue of whether Mr Atkinson could have survived is key, and that over the next few days the court will hear from experts who believe better medical treatment could have made a difference.

Next: Overseas workers only way to solve shortagesNext boss Lord Wolfson says hiring overseas workers under a visa tax scheme is the solution to shortages.BusinessComments,"Next chief executive Lord Wolfson has said labour shortages could be solved by companies hiring overseas workers and paying a ""visa tax"". Staff were not available in the places needed and seasonal workers were difficult to recruit, he told the BBC's Today programme. Next has warned warehouse and logistics staffing is under pressure. The comments are the latest inexchanges between the pro-Brexit Tory peer and Prime Minister Boris Johnson. Mr Johnson said Lord Wolfson ""doesn't want any kind of control or restraint on the number of people that he can access from abroad to run his business"". But in response, Lord Wolfson said this was ""absolutely not"" the case. Business and government trade blows in blame game Next shoppers splurge on summer clothes Clothes and fuel costs push prices to 2-year high Lord Wolfson suggested businesses could get visas for skills they ""desperately need"" and recommended that they should have to pay UK workers the same amount as overseas workers. To make this competitive, he argued businesses should have to pay a ""visa tax on top - lets say 7% of wages"". ""We need to design a system that delivers the skills but at the same time makes sure UK workers are not deprived of opportunities that they might want,"" he said. He added that this solution would ""ensure people are not being brought into the UK to undercut UK workers because they will always be more expensive and it provides the skills Britain desperately needs to keep its industry moving"". He suggested that only UK businesses should be able to apply for these visas, rather than workers, and that it should not cost the employers more than recruiting in the UK. The retail chain currently pays store sales consultants and stock assistants between Â£6.55 to Â£9.21 an hour and warehouse operatives between Â£9.30 and Â£11.26 an hour. At Next, Lord Wolfson said that warehouse wages had gone up by around 60% in the last 10 years and 70% for Christmas wages, and added that ""wages have already gone up significantly"". But, he said the firm was still finding that there were not enough workers in particular areas who wanted to move for short periods of time. Last week, Next warned of price rises and staff shortages before Christmas unless immigration rules were eased. It also said higher shipping costs, particularly for larger furniture items, were pushing up its prices. The company's warning over potential staffing issues during the festive period was made in its half-year results, which showed profit before tax was up by 5.9% compared to 2019 levels. The firm said rising shipping costs had driven up prices by about 2%, with its larger home products ""bearing the brunt of the increase"". It added that in the first half of next year, it expected prices to increase by an average 2.5%, with homeware prices up 6%.

Firms urge help after gas prices hit record high,"UK wholesale gas prices hit a record high before falling after Russia said it was boosting supplies to Europe. Russia President Vladimir Putin appeared to calm the market after gas prices had risen by 37% in 24 hours to trade at 400p per therm on Wednesday. UK gas was 60p per therm at the start of the year, but high global demand and reduced supply has driven prices up. The high cost of wholesale gas has seen several UK energy firms collapse and halted production across industries. Following Mr Putin's comments on supplies, gas prices dropped to about 257p a therm later on Wednesday. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the changing gas prices underlined the ""volatility in the market and the nervousness amongst investors about low stockpiles of gas across Europe"". ""When Putin's promises help calm the storm of rising prices which was pummelling financial markets, it's clear investors are desperate for any gust of good news blowing in,"" she said. Why are your energy bills going up? Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? What's CO2 used for in food and drink? The surge in prices led to Energy Intensive Users Group, which represents steel, chemical and fertiliser firms, calling on the government to help keep businesses and industries running. Industry leaders said surging costs had already resulted in steel production halting ""at times of peak demand"". Last month, US-owned CF Industries shut two UK sites that produce 60% of the country's commercial carbon dioxide supplies because of the rise in gas prices, before the government stepped in to meet its operating costs for its Teesside plant for three weeks. The shut down led to a shortage of carbon dioxide - a by-product of the fertiliser factories - which sparked warnings from food producers and supermarkets of shortages in the supply of fresh produce. The gas is to stun animals for slaughter and in packaging to prolong shelf life. ""We have already seen the impact of the truly astronomical increases in energy costs on production in the fertiliser and steel sectors,"" said Richard Leese, chairman of the Energy Intensive Users Group. ""Nobody wants to see a repeat in other industries this winter, given that UK EIIs [energy intensive industries] produce so many essential domestic and industrial products and are intrinsically linked with many supply chains."" A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""We are determined to secure a competitive future for our energy intensive industries and in recent years have provided them with extensive support, including more than Â£2bn to help with the costs of energy and to protect jobs. ""Our exposure to volatile global gas prices underscores the importance of our plan to build a strong, home-grown renewable energy sector to further reduce our reliance on fossil fuels."" Besides industry struggles, a total of nine energy suppliers have collapsed in recent weeks, which has affected nearly 1.73 million customers in September alone. The companies that have gone bust have been mostly smaller firms, which have been unable to deliver price promises to customers because of the surge in gas prices. Firms going bust has also had a knock on effect to auto-switching services, with Look After My Bills, famous for its popularity on BBC Two's Dragon's Den, ""pausing"" its operations, and fellow auto-switching company Flipper closing down completely. Flipper said in a statement that it had withdrawn from the market and was closing because it could ""no longer sustain the great savings"" its customers had ""come to expect"". Meanwhile, Look After My Bills said it was ""temporarily pausing"" its switching service, but would be ""back as soon as we can"" access energy deals ""right"" for customers. Affected customers have been told they will be switched to a new tariff by energy regulator Ofgem and be contacted by their new supplier. It has advised people to take a meter reading and to wait until a new supplier has been appointed before looking to switch to another energy firm. Jonathan Brearley, the boss of Ofgem, has warned that the cost of protecting customers from failing energy providers could lead to higher bills. A higher energy price cap came into force on Friday, with those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, seeing bills go up by Â£139 to Â£1,277 a year. Customers are protected from sudden hikes in gas prices through the energy price cap, which sets maximum prices and charges for those on a standard or default tariff. However, the next revision of the cap, which will affect bills from the start of April, is likely to rise significantly to reflect the greater costs faced by suppliers. Analysts at energy consultancy Cornwall Insight have predicted the next cap will mean the typical household will have an annual bill of Â£1,600 and the impact of the crisis could be felt into 2023. ""The explosion of choice and innovation seen in the sector in the last decade by challenger suppliers has been fundamentally altered in a matter of months, and while all eyes will inevitably be on this winter, the need for an enduring solution to ensure that the gains experienced by almost three decades of competition are not lost,"" said its senior consultant, Craig Lowrey.

Police staff investigated over Plymouth shootings,"Five people were shot and killed in the Keyham area of Plymouth A member of police staff has been issued with a gross misconduct notice over their handling of Plymouth gunman Jake Davison's application for a shotgun certificate. Davison shot and killed five people in Keyham, Plymouth, on 12 August. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said the certificate was returned to Davison weeks before the killings. A second person - a police officer - has received a misconduct notice. The misconduct notice relates to the handling of two assaults in 2020 admitted by Davison. Maxine Davison, 51, Stephen Washington, 59, Kate Shepherd, 66, Lee Martyn, 43 and three-year-old Sophie Martyn, were all killed by Davison before he turned the gun on himself. The IOPC is investigating how the apprentice crane operator was originally granted a shotgun certificate in 2017 by Devon and Cornwall Police. The watchdog is also examining how Davison was handed back the weapon and certificate weeks before the shooting - having been seized after admitting the two assaults on youths in a park in September 2020. Davison was placed on a voluntary intervention programme following the assaults - an alternative to being charged or cautioned. His shotgun and licence were not seized for another three months until concerns were raised directly with the police by a member of staff working on the intervention programme. In July, Davison was given back his shotgun, which he used for clay pigeon shooting, and his certificate. Lee Martyn and his daughter Sophie were both killed in the attack The IOPC said it was investigating whether the police officer ""shared information appropriately with the force Firearms and Explosives Licensing Department"" regarding the violent offences, and whether they ""took appropriate steps to seize the shotgun certificate, shotgun, and ammunition"". The watchdog said ""the serving of such notices advises individuals that their conduct is subject to investigation, but does not mean that disciplinary proceedings will necessarily follow"". It added that it hoped to complete its investigation into Devon and Cornwall Police's decision-making in relation to Davison's possession of a shotgun and shotgun certificate, by the end of the year. David Ford, IOPC regional director, said his organisation was reviewing ""a substantial amount of information gathered from Devon and Cornwall Police and elsewhere"". He said: ""Based on the evidence gathered so far, we have now served disciplinary notices on two individuals within the force to advise them their conduct is subject to investigation."" Maxine Davison, the gunman's mother, was named by police as his first victim Devon and Cornwall Police Assistant Chief Constable Jim Nye said the force was ""fully cooperating"" with the investigation. He said: ""We acknowledge that the IOPC has served a police officer with a misconduct notice and a staff member with a gross misconduct notice, in relation to their involvement with Jake Davison. ""The force is supporting our staff through this process."" Follow BBC News South West onTwitter,external,Facebook,externalandInstagram,external. Send your story ideas tospotlight@bbc.co.uk,external.

Firms going bust has also had a knock on effect to auto-switching services, with Look After My Bills, famous for its popularity on BBC Two's Dragon's Den, ""pausing"" its operations, and fellow auto-switching company Flipper closing down completely. Flipper said in a statement that it had withdrawn from the market and was closing because it could ""no longer sustain the great savings"" its customers had ""come to expect"". Meanwhile, Look After My Bills said it was ""temporarily pausing"" its switching service, but would be ""back as soon as we can"" access energy deals ""right"" for customers. Affected customers have been told they will be switched to a new tariff by energy regulator Ofgem and be contacted by their new supplier. It has advised people to take a meter reading and to wait until a new supplier has been appointed before looking to switch to another energy firm. Jonathan Brearley, the boss of Ofgem, has warned that the cost of protecting customers from failing energy providers could lead to higher bills. A higher energy price cap came into force on Friday, with those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, seeing bills go up by Â£139 to Â£1,277 a year. Customers are protected from sudden hikes in gas prices through the energy price cap, which sets maximum prices and charges for those on a standard or default tariff. However, the next revision of the cap, which will affect bills from the start of April, is likely to rise significantly to reflect the greater costs faced by suppliers. Analysts at energy consultancy Cornwall Insight have predicted the next cap will mean the typical household will have an annual bill of Â£1,600 and the impact of the crisis could be felt into 2023. ""The explosion of choice and innovation seen in the sector in the last decade by challenger suppliers has been fundamentally altered in a matter of months, and while all eyes will inevitably be on this winter, the need for an enduring solution to ensure that the gains experienced by almost three decades of competition are not lost,"" said its senior consultant, Craig Lowrey.

"Arena bomb victim may have survived, inquiry toldThe Manchester Arena Inquiry hears paramedics did not attend to John Atkinson for nearly 50 minutes.Manchester","John Atkinson was not assessed by paramedics for 47 minutes, the inquiry heard The family of a care worker killed in the Manchester Arena attack have praised ""heroic"" efforts by a member of the public to try and save him. John Atkinson, 28, was one of 22 people who died when a bomb was detonated in the arena foyer on 22 May 2017. Members of the public and police helped him but he was not assessed by paramedics for nearly 50 minutes. The public inquiry has previously heard he may have survived had he been given medical treatment more quickly. It has been looking at the individual circumstances of the deaths of each victim, who were killed when Salman Abedi detonated a device at an Ariana Grande concert. Mr Atkinson, from Radcliffe in Bury, was 20ft (6m) away from Abedi when the bomb went off and was separated from the friend he had attended the concert with. The inquiry heard CCTV footage showed that within five seconds of the blast Mr Atkinson crawled on his hands and knees across the floor of the foyer. A member of the public, Ronald Blake, phoned 999 within 52 seconds of the blast and used a belt as a tourniquet to try and stem the bleeding from Mr Atkinson's leg. Mr Blake, who was injured himself and had no first aid training, stayed with Mr Atkinson for nearly an hour holding the tourniquet the entire time, the inquiry heard. John Cooper QC, representing Mr Atkinson's family, told Mr Blake: ""I profoundly thank you on their behalf for the hard work, dedication and heroics you performed on that night trying to save John."" Ronald Blake used a belt as a tourniquet and held it on John Atkinson's leg for nearly an hour Mr Blake said Mr Atkinson was conscious and talking while they were together and he was ""shocked"" to discover the next day, when he was being treated in hospital for his own injuries, that he had died. Giving evidence, he told the inquiry: ""I have never had any first aid training and my natural instinct at the arena was to try and stop the blood and keep him conscious. ""When I left him with the paramedics I thought he was going to survive."" Mr Blake replied ""yes"" when Mr Cooper asked him: ""During the time you were dealing with John it was obvious, wasn't it, that he was very, very severely injured?"" Bomb victim spent last moments laughing and joking Nurse felt helpless in Arena bomb aftermath PCs thanked for 'heroic efforts' after Arena bomb The inquiry heard it was more than 45 minutes before anyone came to help lift Mr Atkinson out of the foyer and down the stairs to the casualty clearing station at the adjoining Victoria railway station. British Transport Police constable Jessica Bullough, who assisted Mr Atkinson, said: ""We realised that no-one was coming to help us and so it was better to get people downstairs."" A decision was made to grab a display board to carry Mr Atkinson out of the foyer, the inquiry heard. However, a metal barrier then needed to be fetched as the board was too ""flimsy"" and would not fit in a nearby lift. Twenty-two people were killed in the May 2017 bombing The inquiry heard PC Leon McLaughlin asked North West Ambulance Service (NWAS) incident commander Dan Smith for a stretcher to carry Mr Atkinson down the stairs. PC McLaughlin said he felt he was ""ignored"" and told by Mr Smith to ""blanket him up"" and ""leave him there for now"". The officer said he felt ""frustrated"" but said it was ""clear that they were not going to move from where they wereâ¦.and provide me with any meaningful help"". The inquiry heard only three NWAS paramedics entered the foyer on the night, two of them just a few minutes before Mr Atkinson was evacuated. On the available footage Mr Atkinson was not triaged, assessed or assisted by NWAS personnel for the 47 minutes he was in the room, the hearing was told. The hearing has been told the issue of whether Mr Atkinson could have survived is key, and that over the next few days the court will hear from experts who believe better medical treatment could have made a difference.

Twitch reportedly suffers massive data leak,"Game-streaming platform Twitch has been the victim of a leak, reportedly divulging confidential company information and streamers' earnings. More than 100GB of data was posted online on Wednesday. The documents appear to show Twitch's top streamers each made millions of dollars from the Amazon-owned company in the past two years. Twitch confirmed the breach and said it was ""working with urgency"" to understand the extent of it. In a statementposted on Twitter,external, the company said it would ""update the community as soon as additional information is available"". Fortnite streamer BBG Calc told BBC News: ""The earnings list got my figure 100% correct."" Another streamer confirmed to the BBC that their earnings were ""accurate"" while a third person closely linked to a high profile player said the details were ""about right"". Those behind the leak also claimed to have the source code for the video platform itself. The documents, shared in online forums, appear to show payments made from August or September 2019 to October 2021. Some versions shared online point to well known streamers, including Dungeons & Dragons channel CriticalRole, Canadian xQC and American Summit1g, as being among the top earners. Twitch famously fiercely guards operational details such as how much its streamers are paid, so this looks extremely embarrassing for the company. And it comes at a time when competitors such as YouTube Gaming are offering huge salaries to snap up gaming talent, so the fallout could be significant. Aside from the salary details, the documents seems to contain the site's source code and even technical details for yet to be released products and platforms. And evidence is building at least some of the data looks real. Security experts tell me the files contains things such as internal server details that can be accessed by Twitch employees only. And if it is all confirmed, it will be the biggest leak I have ever seen - an entire company's most valuable data cleaned out in one fell swoop. But the list of payments, apparently from Twitch itself, is unlikely to include sponsorship deals and other off-platform activities - or account for tax paid on income. And many, if not all, of these top streamers are effectively large-scale media operations, with their own employees and business expenses - so the numbers do not represent ""take-home pay"" for those listed, even if genuine. TikTok and Twitch face fines under new Ofcom rules Twitch announces new tools to fight harassment The documents also reportedly contain a trove of internal Twitch data. Metadata being posted to internet forums appears to show folders of data named after important software areas, including: ""core config packages"" ""devtools"" (developer tools) ""infosec"" (information security) The documents also allegedly contain source code for Twitch's website and related services, labelled ""part one"" - suggesting there may be more unreleased material. In the earliest known online post linking to the data, the anonymous poster labelled the Twitch community ""a disgusting toxic cesspool"" and claimed the leak was being posted ""to foster more disruption and competition"" in video streaming. In recent months, Twitch has been battling a number of issues on its platform, such as ""hate raids"" -organised harassment of streamers from minority backgrounds. And in early September, a boycott titled ""a day off Twitch"" saw creators effectively strike in protest at the lack of action on hate raids. The UK's Information Commissioner's Office said it had not been notified of any data breach by Twitch or Amazon.

Chemistry Nobel awarded for mirror-image molecules,"Benjamin List (L) and David MacMillan (R) Two scientists have been awarded the 2021 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work on building molecules that are mirror images of one another. German-born Benjamin List and Scotland-born David MacMillan were announced as the winners at an event in Stockholm. Their chemical toolkit has been used for discovering new drugs and making molecules that can capture light in solar cells. The winners will share the prize money of 10 million krona (Â£842,611). Asked how he felt winning, Prof MacMillan, from Princeton University, said: ""Dazed, confused, elated, proud, sentimental, weepy - you name it. I feel all of those things right now."" Prof List was on holiday with his family when he heard the news: ""I absolutely didn't expect this huge surprise,"" adding that he ""thought it was a joke"" when he received the call from Sweden. The scientific process in question, called asymmetric organocatalysis, has made it much easier to produce asymmetric molecules - chemicals that exist in two versions, where one is a mirror image of the other. Chemists often just want one of these mirror images - particularly when producing medicines - but it has been difficult to find efficient methods for doing this. Two women share chemistry Nobel in historic win Climate science breakthroughs win physics Nobel Sense of touch and heat research wins Nobel Prize Some molecules with mirror versions have different properties. An example is the chemical called carvone, which has one form that smells like spearmint and a counterpart that smells like the herb, dill. Nobel Committee member Prof Peter Somfai reasoned that, if the body can differentiate between two mirror images, the same might be true for drugs used to treat illnesses. In other words, different versions of the same molecule might have different effects when ingested. ""Then it becomes important to be able to make only the mirror image of a drug that has the desired physiological effect,"" said Prof Somfai, during the news conference at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. One tragic example of this principle was the drug thalidomide, approved for treating morning sickness and other conditions in the 1950s. It was withdrawn when it was found to cause disabilities in babies. Thalidomide medication contained two mirror versions of the same chemical compound mixed in together. One of these versions damaged the developing foetus. David MacMillan, 53, was born in Bellshill, North Lanarkshire, and is the James S McDonnell Distinguished Professor of Chemistry at Princeton University in New Jersey. Benjamin List, also 53, is from Frankfurt, Germany. He is a professor at the University of Cologne and the Max Planck Institute for Coal Research. Their work focused on catalysts, substances that can speed up chemical reactions without becoming part of the final product. While at Harvard University in the late 1990s, MacMillan had been working with metal catalysts. But the types used in his research were rarely taken up by industry. The problem was that, while the oxygen-free and moisture-free conditions demanded by some metal catalysts were possible to achieve in the lab, this was much more difficult at large scales. The Scottish chemist began designing simple organic molecules (chemicals that contain carbon and hydrogen bonded together) which could do the same job as metals, but were not destroyed by moisture. Prof MacMillan worked with metal catalysts before investigating whether organic molecules could perform similar tasks Meanwhile, Benjamin List was working towards a similar goal. He had been able to show that a simple amino acid called proline could act as a highly effective catalyst. It was also cheap and environmentally-friendly. Prof Somfai, who works at Sweden's Lund University, said List and MacMillan had ""rationalised their findings"" in such a simple way that  it was immediately appreciated by the scientific community"". He added: ""This resulted in a 'gold rush' - or an explosion - in this area... It's easy to design new things given this easy explanation."" The Nobel Committee said the technique had ""taken molecular construction to an entirely new level"". The Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel founded the prizes in his will, written a year before his death in 1896. A total of 187 individuals have received the chemistry prize since it was first awarded in 1901. Only seven of these laureates have been women. One person, the British biochemist Frederick Sanger, won the prize twice - in 1958 and 1980. The country that has had most chemistry laureates is the United States, with 72 winners.

Tesco shrugs off supply concerns as sales surge,"Tesco has seen sales and profits grow faster than expected as Britain's biggest supermarket group shrugged off the pandemic impact.

Chemistry Nobel awarded for mirror-image moleculesA Briton and a German have been awarded the chemistry Nobel for their work to build new molecules.,"Benjamin List (L) and David MacMillan (R) Two scientists have been awarded the 2021 Nobel Prize in Chemistry for their work on building molecules that are mirror images of one another. German-born Benjamin List and Scotland-born David MacMillan were announced as the winners at an event in Stockholm. Their chemical toolkit has been used for discovering new drugs and making molecules that can capture light in solar cells. The winners will share the prize money of 10 million krona (Â£842,611). Asked how he felt winning, Prof MacMillan, from Princeton University, said: ""Dazed, confused, elated, proud, sentimental, weepy - you name it. I feel all of those things right now."" Prof List was on holiday with his family when he heard the news: ""I absolutely didn't expect this huge surprise,"" adding that he ""thought it was a joke"" when he received the call from Sweden. The scientific process in question, called asymmetric organocatalysis, has made it much easier to produce asymmetric molecules - chemicals that exist in two versions, where one is a mirror image of the other. Chemists often just want one of these mirror images - particularly when producing medicines - but it has been difficult to find efficient methods for doing this. Two women share chemistry Nobel in historic win Climate science breakthroughs win physics Nobel Sense of touch and heat research wins Nobel Prize Some molecules with mirror versions have different properties. An example is the chemical called carvone, which has one form that smells like spearmint and a counterpart that smells like the herb, dill. Nobel Committee member Prof Peter Somfai reasoned that, if the body can differentiate between two mirror images, the same might be true for drugs used to treat illnesses. In other words, different versions of the same molecule might have different effects when ingested. ""Then it becomes important to be able to make only the mirror image of a drug that has the desired physiological effect,"" said Prof Somfai, during the news conference at the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences. One tragic example of this principle was the drug thalidomide, approved for treating morning sickness and other conditions in the 1950s. It was withdrawn when it was found to cause disabilities in babies. Thalidomide medication contained two mirror versions of the same chemical compound mixed in together. One of these versions damaged the developing foetus. David MacMillan, 53, was born in Bellshill, North Lanarkshire, and is the James S McDonnell Distinguished Professor of Chemistry at Princeton University in New Jersey. Benjamin List, also 53, is from Frankfurt, Germany. He is a professor at the University of Cologne and the Max Planck Institute for Coal Research. Their work focused on catalysts, substances that can speed up chemical reactions without becoming part of the final product. While at Harvard University in the late 1990s, MacMillan had been working with metal catalysts. But the types used in his research were rarely taken up by industry. The problem was that, while the oxygen-free and moisture-free conditions demanded by some metal catalysts were possible to achieve in the lab, this was much more difficult at large scales. The Scottish chemist began designing simple organic molecules (chemicals that contain carbon and hydrogen bonded together) which could do the same job as metals, but were not destroyed by moisture. Prof MacMillan worked with metal catalysts before investigating whether organic molecules could perform similar tasks Meanwhile, Benjamin List was working towards a similar goal. He had been able to show that a simple amino acid called proline could act as a highly effective catalyst. It was also cheap and environmentally-friendly. Prof Somfai, who works at Sweden's Lund University, said List and MacMillan had ""rationalised their findings"" in such a simple way that  it was immediately appreciated by the scientific community"". He added: ""This resulted in a 'gold rush' - or an explosion - in this area... It's easy to design new things given this easy explanation."" The Nobel Committee said the technique had ""taken molecular construction to an entirely new level"". The Swedish industrialist Alfred Nobel founded the prizes in his will, written a year before his death in 1896. A total of 187 individuals have received the chemistry prize since it was first awarded in 1901. Only seven of these laureates have been women. One person, the British biochemist Frederick Sanger, won the prize twice - in 1958 and 1980. The country that has had most chemistry laureates is the United States, with 72 winners. Germany and the UK share second place with 34 laureates each.

Police staff investigated over Plymouth shootingsA gross misconduct notice has been issued to a police staff member over Davison's shotgun licence.Devon,"Five people were shot and killed in the Keyham area of Plymouth A member of police staff has been issued with a gross misconduct notice over their handling of Plymouth gunman Jake Davison's application for a shotgun certificate. Davison shot and killed five people in Keyham, Plymouth, on 12 August. The Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) said the certificate was returned to Davison weeks before the killings. A second person - a police officer - has received a misconduct notice. The misconduct notice relates to the handling of two assaults in 2020 admitted by Davison. Maxine Davison, 51, Stephen Washington, 59, Kate Shepherd, 66, Lee Martyn, 43 and three-year-old Sophie Martyn, were all killed by Davison before he turned the gun on himself. The IOPC is investigating how the apprentice crane operator was originally granted a shotgun certificate in 2017 by Devon and Cornwall Police. The watchdog is also examining how Davison was handed back the weapon and certificate weeks before the shooting - having been seized after admitting the two assaults on youths in a park in September 2020. Davison was placed on a voluntary intervention programme following the assaults - an alternative to being charged or cautioned. His shotgun and licence were not seized for another three months until concerns were raised directly with the police by a member of staff working on the intervention programme. In July, Davison was given back his shotgun, which he used for clay pigeon shooting, and his certificate. Lee Martyn and his daughter Sophie were both killed in the attack The IOPC said it was investigating whether the police officer ""shared information appropriately with the force Firearms and Explosives Licensing Department"" regarding the violent offences, and whether they ""took appropriate steps to seize the shotgun certificate, shotgun, and ammunition"". The watchdog said ""the serving of such notices advises individuals that their conduct is subject to investigation, but does not mean that disciplinary proceedings will necessarily follow"". It added that it hoped to complete its investigation into Devon and Cornwall Police's decision-making in relation to Davison's possession of a shotgun and shotgun certificate, by the end of the year. David Ford, IOPC regional director, said his organisation was reviewing ""a substantial amount of information gathered from Devon and Cornwall Police and elsewhere"". He said: ""Based on the evidence gathered so far, we have now served disciplinary notices on two individuals within the force to advise them their conduct is subject to investigation."" Maxine Davison, the gunman's mother, was named by police as his first victim Devon and Cornwall Police Assistant Chief Constable Jim Nye said the force was ""fully cooperating"" with the investigation. He said: ""We acknowledge that the IOPC has served a police officer with a misconduct notice and a staff member with a gross misconduct notice, in relation to their involvement with Jake Davison.

"Twitch reportedly suffers massive data leakDocuments, shared in online forums appear to show records of payments made to streamers.Technology","Game-streaming platform Twitch has been the victim of a leak, reportedly divulging confidential company information and streamers' earnings. More than 100GB of data was posted online on Wednesday. The documents appear to show Twitch's top streamers each made millions of dollars from the Amazon-owned company in the past two years. Twitch confirmed the breach and said it was ""working with urgency"" to understand the extent of it. In a statementposted on Twitter,external, the company said it would ""update the community as soon as additional information is available"". Fortnite streamer BBG Calc told BBC News: ""The earnings list got my figure 100% correct."" Another streamer confirmed to the BBC that their earnings were ""accurate"" while a third person closely linked to a high profile player said the details were ""about right"". Those behind the leak also claimed to have the source code for the video platform itself. The documents, shared in online forums, appear to show payments made from August or September 2019 to October 2021. Some versions shared online point to well known streamers, including Dungeons & Dragons channel CriticalRole, Canadian xQC and American Summit1g, as being among the top earners. Twitch famously fiercely guards operational details such as how much its streamers are paid, so this looks extremely embarrassing for the company. And it comes at a time when competitors such as YouTube Gaming are offering huge salaries to snap up gaming talent, so the fallout could be significant. Aside from the salary details, the documents seems to contain the site's source code and even technical details for yet to be released products and platforms. And evidence is building at least some of the data looks real. Security experts tell me the files contains things such as internal server details that can be accessed by Twitch employees only. And if it is all confirmed, it will be the biggest leak I have ever seen - an entire company's most valuable data cleaned out in one fell swoop. But the list of payments, apparently from Twitch itself, is unlikely to include sponsorship deals and other off-platform activities - or account for tax paid on income. And many, if not all, of these top streamers are effectively large-scale media operations, with their own employees and business expenses - so the numbers do not represent ""take-home pay"" for those listed, even if genuine. TikTok and Twitch face fines under new Ofcom rules Twitch announces new tools to fight harassment The documents also reportedly contain a trove of internal Twitch data. Metadata being posted to internet forums appears to show folders of data named after important software areas, including: ""core config packages"" ""devtools"" (developer tools) ""infosec"" (information security) The documents also allegedly contain source code for Twitch's website and related services, labelled ""part one"" - suggesting there may be more unreleased material. In the earliest known online post linking to the data, the anonymous poster labelled the Twitch community ""a disgusting toxic cesspool"" and claimed the leak was being posted ""to foster more disruption and competition"" in video streaming. In recent months, Twitch has been battling a number of issues on its platform, such as ""hate raids"" -organised harassment of streamers from minority backgrounds. And in early September, a boycott titled ""a day off Twitch"" saw creators effectively strike in protest at the lack of action on hate raids. The UK's Information Commissioner's Office said it had not been notified of any data breach by Twitch or Amazon.

But the list of payments, apparently from Twitch itself, is unlikely to include sponsorship deals and other off-platform activities - or account for tax paid on income. And many, if not all, of these top streamers are effectively large-scale media operations, with their own employees and business expenses - so the numbers do not represent ""take-home pay"" for those listed, even if genuine. TikTok and Twitch face fines under new Ofcom rules Twitch announces new tools to fight harassment The documents also reportedly contain a trove of internal Twitch data. Metadata being posted to internet forums appears to show folders of data named after important software areas, including: ""core config packages"" ""devtools"" (developer tools) ""infosec"" (information security) The documents also allegedly contain source code for Twitch's website and related services, labelled ""part one"" - suggesting there may be more unreleased material. In the earliest known online post linking to the data, the anonymous poster labelled the Twitch community ""a disgusting toxic cesspool"" and claimed the leak was being posted ""to foster more disruption and competition"" in video streaming. In recent months, Twitch has been battling a number of issues on its platform, such as ""hate raids"" -organised harassment of streamers from minority backgrounds. And in early September, a boycott titled ""a day off Twitch"" saw creators effectively strike in protest at the lack of action on hate raids. The UK's Information Commissioner's Office said it had not been notified of any data breach by Twitch or Amazon.

Fresh call for vote on universal credit top-up end,"This video can not be played Universal credit: What Â£20 means to me A Conservative peer who helped design the universal credit system has renewed her call for a vote on the end of the Â£20-a-week top-up to the benefit. Baroness Philippa Stroud said it was a ""really bleak day"" for many families as the extra money is withdrawn from Wednesday. But the new justice secretary Dominic Raab told the BBC the top-up was always meant to be temporary. Extending the booster paymentwould cost around Â£6bn a year. The government has said that spending has to be brought under control after unprecedented emergency interventions during the pandemic. Mr Raab defended the withdrawal of the booster payment, insisting the government wanted to ""avoid the benefits and welfare trap"" and universal credit was designed to encourage people back into work. He pointed out the Â£400bn ministers put into helping the economy, workers and the most vulnerable was ""clearly unsustainable"" in the long-term. But the government has continued to help jobless people find work, he added, citing theÂ£4.3bn stimulus package unveiled by the chancellor last year. Mr Raab told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""What we've done - national living wage, personal allowance, the ending of the over-reliance on cheap labour from abroad which depresses wages - is so critical to our vision for the economy."" Universal credit reduction: 'I feel overwhelmed' Universal credit: End of the Â£20 boost explained 'Eviction risk' for universal credit renters Universal credit is a benefit for working-age people and was brought in to merge six benefits - such as income support and child tax credit - into one payment. It can be claimed whether a person is in or out of work and is drawn by more than 5.8 million people in England, Scotland and Wales - with almost 40% of them classed as being in employment. The benefit is made up of a standard allowance - whichdiffers according to age and personal circumstances,external- plus any additional amounts that apply, such as having children, a disability or health condition that stops someone from working. A Â£20-a-week increase to universal credit was brought in as a temporary measure to help those on low incomes hit financially by coronavirus lockdowns. The extra universal credit payment works out as about Â£87 a month, or Â£1,040 a year. The scheme is officially due to end on Wednesday, but the exact date the money will stop being paid will vary depending on the day a person usually receives their universal credit. You can read morehere. Baroness Stroud, who is chief executive officer of the Legatum Institute think tank, told the same programme that their calculations showed the withdrawal of the top-up would push 840,000 people into poverty - including 290,000 children. ""There are people who are out of work who will move back into work, but there are also 450,000 who will move into poverty today as a result of this who have disabilities or who have children who are disabled,"" she said. Baroness Stroud reiterated her call for a cross-party House of Lords vote on the decision to remove the Â£20-a-week top-up ""that would say to the House of Commons, think again on this issue"". She previously told the BBCshe would table an amendment to the Social Security Billwhen it reached the House of Lords, but this has not yet happened. Nicola Flower says the Â£20 booster payment helped pay for heating during her cancer treatment For Nicola Flower, from Cornwall, the uplift in universal credit has helped her stay warm by paying for heating bills during her cancer treatment. She told the BBC she has had to shield for a year due to the coronavirus pandemic and is still waiting for an operation. ""I had no choice but to go on it [universal credit],"" she said. ""It was a godsend because I wouldn't have managed otherwise. I have never been on benefits before in my life. I have always done three jobs."" Nicola, who worked as a seamstress, in a supermarket and as a cleaner, said the she knew the Â£20 uplift was ""an extra"", but added with fuel prices and gas prices rising, she could do with the money. You can read morehere. Campaigners, charities, and MPs have called for the top-up to be made permanent to help those who are still struggling. The Independent Food Aid Network (IFAN) has urged the government to continue the uplift, saying food banks are struggling to support ""ever-increasing"" numbers of people. The network - which represents 500 UK food banks and providers - says it is ""running out of options"" as volunteer numbers and public donations have dropped, food supply shortages have caused problems, and staff are already stretched to meet current demand. Earlier this week the homelessness charity Crisis warned that about100,000 renters could face eviction when the Â£20 booster payment ends. The Labour party accused ministers of being ""complacent about the cost of living crisis""amid concerns over rising energy prices and the end to the top-up in universal credit. Its shadow business secretary Ed Miliband warned the end to the booster payment risked ""plunging"" people into fuel poverty. Paddy Lillis, general secretary of the shopworkers union Usdaw, said: ""It is shameful the government is removing this crucial lifeline for low-paid workers and their families; particularly as they face rising utility bills and national insurance increases, along with fuel and food shortages that are impacting the cost of living."" He urged the prime minister to ""do the right thing"" by cancelling the withdrawal of the universal credit top-up and ""committing to reforming a social security system that doesn't provide the support working families need"". But the government has insisted the uplift to universal credit was always meant to be temporary and designed to help people through the toughest stages of the pandemic. It added that higher wages, rather than taxpayer-funded benefit rises, would be the best way to tackle poverty as the country emerged from Covid restrictions. How are universal credit rules changing?

"Promoting opportunity is Tory mission, says PM","This video can not be played Boris Johnson says he wants a ""high-wage, high-skill, high-productivity, and low tax economy"" Boris Johnson has promised to ""get on with the job"" of uniting and levelling up the UK, in a speech to the Conservative Party conference. In an upbeat address peppered with jokes, but light on new policy, the prime minister claimed a high-wage, high-skilled economy was being created in the wake of Brexit and the pandemic. He also defended tax rises to pay for the NHS and vowed to fix social care. The 45-minute speech was his first to a conference since the pandemic began. In it, the prime minister said the overwhelming Conservative general election victory in 2019 placed an onus on his government to deliver change demanded by voters. The main theme of his speech was ""levelling up"", with the PM saying that reducing gaps between regions would ease pressure on south-eastern England, while boosting places that felt left behind. Kuenssberg: Will UK's problems burst the PM's balloon? Five things we learned at Tory conference Boris Johnson's conference speech fact-checked Â£3,000 promised for maths and science teachers He also repeated pledges set out at during his party's conference this week in Manchester to crack down on crime, improve transport links and broadband, and reform the housing market. And he sought to reassure Tories anxious about plans to increase National Insurance to pay for the NHS and social care by claiming it was what predecessor Margaret Thatcher would have done, if the economy had been hit by a ""meteorite"" like the pandemic. ""She would have wagged her finger and said that more borrowing now is just higher interest rates and even higher taxes later,"" he said. Boris Johnson is an optimist. The prime minister wants a new economic model with better pay and conditions. He wants to persuade voters his is the party to distribute wealth and opportunity more evenly across the UK. He wants people to feel good about the future. Levelling up has been the slogan repeated by ministers at this conference. We only got a sliver of meat on the bones today. This was a speech thin on policy, big on jokes and rhetorical flourishes. Conservatives love Mr Johnson because he makes them feel good - it's a strategy that is key to understanding his success as a politician. But will it be enough? There are some difficult months ahead for many people. Rising prices, supply chain issues, the end of the universal credit top-up and furlough. Many Conservatives acknowledge the cost of living squeeze - and are worried about the impact. Critics will accuse the prime minister of ignoring those big issues in favour of what they see as vague promises for the future. But the hope in Manchester was that Boris Johnson's unflinchingly upbeat vision of a post-Brexit, post-pandemic Britain is as popular with voters as it is with Tory activists. The Conservative conference has taken place amid concerns over rising inflation, supply chain problems, and petrol and worker shortages. But Mr Johnson insisted that the present problems were the result of an economic rebound in the wake of Covid shutdowns. He added that controls on immigration represented the ""change that people voted for"" in the 2016 Brexit referendum, while also promising to end declining home ownership among young people by building more housing. He announced a Â£3,000-a-year bonus for teachers, as an incentive for struggling areas of England to recruit maths and science specialists. The policy replaces a similar nationwide scheme that has recently been phased out. Downing Street said the new ""levelling up premium"" would cost Â£60m, but no details have yet been given over which areas will qualify. This video can not be played New Tory MPs talk 'levelling up' ""There is no reason why the inhabitants of one part of the country should be geographically fated to be poorer than others,"" Mr Johnson said. ""You will find talent, genius, flair, imagination, enthusiasm - all of them evenly distributed around this country. But opportunity is not."" Mr Johnson referred to Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove, who was recently photographeddancing in an Aberdeen nightclub,as ""Jon Bon Govi"" - an allusion to the rock star Jon Bon Jovi. He also mocked Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer, whom he has frequently dubbed ""Captain Hindsight"". ""If Columbus had listened to Captain Hindsight, he'd be famous for discovering Tenerife,"" he joked. But Sir Keir accused Mr Johnson of ""playing this game where he's pretending that he's just sort of just landed from the Moon and he's looking around and saying, 'Things look pretty awful around here, we need a bit of levelling up, things are so awful'"". He told ITV's Peston programme: ""He and the Tories have been in government for 11 years, so we're in this state because of the way that they have governed the country."" The CBI business lobby group said Mr Johnson said set out a ""compelling vision"" but had so far ""only stated his ambition"" on raising wages.

Firms urge help as gas prices soar to record highThe UK's gas benchmark price hits record highs on Wednesday after rising 37%.Business,"UK wholesale gas prices hit a record high before falling after Russia said it was boosting supplies to Europe. Russia President Vladimir Putin appeared to calm the market after gas prices had risen by 37% in 24 hours to trade at 400p per therm on Wednesday. UK gas was 60p per therm at the start of the year, but high global demand and reduced supply has driven prices up. The high cost of wholesale gas has seen several UK energy firms collapse and halted production across industries. Following Mr Putin's comments on supplies, gas prices dropped to about 257p a therm later on Wednesday. Susannah Streeter, senior investment and markets analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the changing gas prices underlined the ""volatility in the market and the nervousness amongst investors about low stockpiles of gas across Europe"". ""When Putin's promises help calm the storm of rising prices which was pummelling financial markets, it's clear investors are desperate for any gust of good news blowing in,"" she said. Why are your energy bills going up? Is the UK headed for a gas shortage this winter? What's CO2 used for in food and drink? The surge in prices led to Energy Intensive Users Group, which represents steel, chemical and fertiliser firms, calling on the government to help keep businesses and industries running. Industry leaders said surging costs had already resulted in steel production halting ""at times of peak demand"". Last month, US-owned CF Industries shut two UK sites that produce 60% of the country's commercial carbon dioxide supplies because of the rise in gas prices, before the government stepped in to meet its operating costs for its Teesside plant for three weeks. The shut down led to a shortage of carbon dioxide - a by-product of the fertiliser factories - which sparked warnings from food producers and supermarkets of shortages in the supply of fresh produce. The gas is to stun animals for slaughter and in packaging to prolong shelf life. ""We have already seen the impact of the truly astronomical increases in energy costs on production in the fertiliser and steel sectors,"" said Richard Leese, chairman of the Energy Intensive Users Group. ""Nobody wants to see a repeat in other industries this winter, given that UK EIIs [energy intensive industries] produce so many essential domestic and industrial products and are intrinsically linked with many supply chains."" A spokesperson for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said: ""We are determined to secure a competitive future for our energy intensive industries and in recent years have provided them with extensive support, including more than Â£2bn to help with the costs of energy and to protect jobs. ""Our exposure to volatile global gas prices underscores the importance of our plan to build a strong, home-grown renewable energy sector to further reduce our reliance on fossil fuels."" Besides industry struggles, a total of nine energy suppliers have collapsed in recent weeks, which has affected nearly 1.73 million customers in September alone. The companies that have gone bust have been mostly smaller firms, which have been unable to deliver price promises to customers because of the surge in gas prices. Firms going bust has also had a knock on effect to auto-switching services, with Look After My Bills, famous for its popularity on BBC Two's Dragon's Den, ""pausing"" its operations, and fellow auto-switching company Flipper closing down completely. Flipper said in a statement that it had withdrawn from the market and was closing because it could ""no longer sustain the great savings"" its customers had ""come to expect"". Meanwhile, Look After My Bills said it was ""temporarily pausing"" its switching service, but would be ""back as soon as we can"" access energy deals ""right"" for customers. Affected customers have been told they will be switched to a new tariff by energy regulator Ofgem and be contacted by their new supplier. It has advised people to take a meter reading and to wait until a new supplier has been appointed before looking to switch to another energy firm. Jonathan Brearley, the boss of Ofgem, has warned that the cost of protecting customers from failing energy providers could lead to higher bills. A higher energy price cap came into force on Friday, with those on standard tariffs, with typical household levels of energy use, seeing bills go up by Â£139 to Â£1,277 a year. Customers are protected from sudden hikes in gas prices through the energy price cap, which sets maximum prices and charges for those on a standard or default tariff. However, the next revision of the cap, which will affect bills from the start of April, is likely to rise significantly to reflect the greater costs faced by suppliers. Analysts at energy consultancy Cornwall Insight have predicted the next cap will mean the typical household will have an annual bill of Â£1,600 and the impact of the crisis could be felt into 2023. ""The explosion of choice and innovation seen in the sector in the last decade by challenger suppliers has been fundamentally altered in a matter of months, and while all eyes will inevitably be on this winter, the need for an enduring solution to ensure that the gains experienced by almost three decades of competition are not lost,"" said its senior consultant, Craig Lowrey.

PM risks looking out of touch,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson tells Laura Kuenssberg he is ""not worried"" about a jobs gap and rising prices in the UK. Boris Johnson is famous for looking publicly on the bright side. Making people laugh, making people feel good, is part of what successful politicians do. His optimism is what defines his public persona. It's also what fuels accusations that he isn't serious about the country's problems and would rather crack a joke than crack a problem. Don't doubt though for a moment that Boris Johnson is deadly serious about power and holding on to it. PM: I'm not worried over jobs gap and price rises Are workers' salaries now rising? Sunak delivers reassurance to Tory faithful There is concern in some corners of government, including among some cabinet ministers, that Number 10 is brushing away concerns about the economy too easily. In our interview with the prime minister this morning he said he's ""not worried"" about the squeeze on supply chains, labour shortages or inflation. Speaking earlier he said there was no crisis. And he's trying to use this moment to argue that what we are seeing are merely the birth pangs of a new economic model. Business will sort things out quickly, he believes, it's down to the market to fix it, rather than government to ""patch and mend"". But talk to some of his colleagues, some of whom made their own warnings about specific economic pinch points before the summer, and you don't quite hear the same. When the prime minister displays a disregard for Westminster's conventions or politesse it's one thing. But running the risk of looking like you don't understand everyday concerns is another. The polls right now suggest that the government is not being punished for queues at the pump or empty shelves. Johnson loyalists credit his political appeal that seems to defy natural gravity. But if prices continue to creep up and disruption continues, those feelings could turn. You can't just tell people to cheer up if their gas bill is going up, their weekly shop costs more and they are losing Â£20 a week from universal credit. After what they consider asuccessful first big foreign trip, and dominance in the polls, Downing Street is in a bullish mood. But confidence can tip into complacency - a sentiment that few voters would reward.

"Facebook weakens democracy, says ex-employeeThe former product manager tells the US Senate that the social media giant put profit before people.","This video can not be played Watch: ""The buck stops with Mark"" A former Facebook employee has told US politicians that the company's sites and apps harm children's mental health and stoke division in society. Frances Haugen, a 37-year-old former product manager turned whistleblower, heavily criticised the company at a hearing in the Senate. Facebook has faced growing scrutiny and increasing calls for its regulation. Founder Mark Zuckerberg hit back, saying the latest accusations were at odds with the company's goals. In a letter to staff, he said many of the claims were ""illogical"" and pointed to Facebook's efforts to fight harmful content. ""We care deeply about issues like safety, well-being and mental health,"" he said in the letter, made public on his Facebook page,external. ""It's difficult to see coverage that misrepresents our work and our motives."" Facebook is the world's most popular social media site. The company says it has 2.7 billion monthly active users. Hundreds of millions of people also use the company's other products, including WhatsApp and Instagram. But it has been criticised on several fronts - from failing to protect users' privacy to not doing enough to halt the spread of disinformation. Facebook down: Zuckerberg apologises for outage Six hours without WhatsApp Ms Haugen told CBS News on Sunday that she had shared a number of internal Facebook documents with the Wall Street Journal in recent weeks. Using the documents, the WSJ reported that research carried out by Instagram showed the app could harm girls' mental health. This was a theme Ms Haugen continued during her testimony on Tuesday. ""The company's leadership knows how to make Facebook and Instagram safer, but won't make the necessary changes because they have put their astronomical profits before people,"" she said. She criticised Mark Zuckerberg for having wide-ranging control, saying that there is ""no one currently holding Mark accountable but himself."" This video can not be played Facebook's Monika Bickert says commissioning research into issues shows the company is prioritising safety above profit And she praisedthe massive outage of Facebook services on Monday, which affected users around the world. ""Yesterday we saw Facebook taken off the internet,"" she said. ""I don't know why it went down, but I know that for more than five hours, Facebook wasn't used to deepen divides, destabilise democracies and make young girls and women feel bad about their bodies."" The answer, she told senators, was congressional oversight. ""We must act now,"" she said. Mr Zuckerberg, in his letter, said the research into Instagram had been mischaracterised and that many young people had positive experiences of using the platform. But he said ""it's very important to me that everything we build is safe and good for kids"". On Monday's outage, he said the deeper concern was not ""how many people switch to competitive services or how much money we lose, but what it means for the people who rely on our services to communicate with loved ones, run their businesses, or support their communities"". Frances Haugen said the company repeatedly prioritised profits over its users safety Both Republican and Democratic senators on Tuesday were united in the need for change at the company - a rare topic of agreement between the two political parties. ""The damage to self-interest and self-worth inflicted by Facebook today will haunt a generation,"" Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal said. ""Big Tech now faces the Big Tobacco jaw-dropping moment of truth,"" he added, a reference to how tobacco firms hid the harmful effects of their products. Fellow Republican Dan Sullivan said the world would look back and ask ""What the hell were we thinking?"" in light of the revelations about Facebook's impact on children. In a statement issued after the hearing, Facebook said it did not agree with Ms Haugen's ""characterisation of the many issues she testified about"". But it did agree that ""it's time to begin to create standard rules for the internet."" ""It's been 25 years since the rules for the internet have been updated, and instead of expecting the industry to make societal decisions that belong to legislators, it is time for Congress to act,"" the statement read. Zuckerbergrattled Mark Zuckerberg's blog is lengthy and thoughtful. He doesn't name Frances Haugen - but he has clearly been rattled. His main argument is that the research she leaked has been misrepresented by both her and the media. He argues that the negative internal research has been cherry-picked and positive conclusions brushed over. Interestingly, he thinks this episode could have a chilling effect on internal research in companies - worried that bad conclusions might one day be leaked. But there is of course a simple come back to this. Release the data. Facebook and other social media companies don't have to do internal research; they could let their data be analysed independently. To be fair to Facebook, the company does give researchers some access. However, only Facebook has the full spectrum of user metrics needed to fully analyse its effect on society. His arguments too are at times overly simplified. Why would we want to make people angry, he asks. I'm sure he doesn't. But it's been proven over and over again that social media that provokes any emotion, whether it be laughter, love or anger gets more engagement. Zuckerberg believes passionately that Facebook is a force for good. It's becoming harder and harder to find people on Capitol Hill who think that.

Knife-edge Covid pass vote will not be re-run,"Gareth Davies was newly elected at May's Senedd elections A Conservative politician who missed a crucial vote on compulsory Covid passes in nightclubs and big events in Wales was at the Tory conference in Manchester at the time. Gareth Davies says he was ""angry"" that he was unable to access the Welsh Parliament's remote voting system. But the Senedd's Presiding Officer Elin Jones said he had been given ""every opportunity to be present"". His absence meant Welsh ministers won by one vote. Elin Jones had said on Tuesday that she had provided her personal phone number to allow Mr Davies to vote. The Night Time Industries Association called for the decision to be taken again, but that was not echoed by any of the Senedd's party groups. Under the new law evidence of full vaccination or a negative Covid test within 48 hours will be required when visiting nightclubs or large events. Health Minister Eluned Morgan has said the vote will not be re-run. The Conservative Party conference has been taking place in Manchester The Senedd, because of the Covid pandemic, is sitting in a hybrid session where MSs can attend in person or take part via Zoom. It had not been clear, initially, where Mr Davies had been at the time of the decision. Then, around Wednesday lunchtime, the Vale of Clwyd politician said he was ""working and representing the group at the Conservative Party conference and I would have been able to vote remotely if I'd have been able to access the remote voting tools"". ""I am deeply upset, frustrated and angry at last night's events and my inability to cast a vote against vaccine passports,"" he said. He said concerns have been raised with the Senedd's ICT department. What is a Covid pass and how do I get one? Covid pass breaches 'should not be police priority' Sturgeon apology over Covid passport app launch However BBC Wales was told attempts had been made by the Senedd to contact Mr Davies but ""no one could get hold of him"" - a Tory source said that was because he was speaking to the chief whip Darren Millar and staff. One MS said that just before the vote Elin Jones read out a phone number to the Tory chief whip for Gareth Davies to call her on. Darren Millar had told Ms Jones there were difficulties with getting one of his members onto Zoom. ""Elin waited for a phone call. The phone didn't ring,"" the MS said. They added that Ms Jones then offered Mr Davies another 30 seconds to get in touch before eventually deciding to proceed. At the time of the vote on Tuesday evening Ms Jones said: ""We are holding the vote please, and we have made every opportunity possible for that... member to get in, including sharing my personal phone."" She later added: ""It is a member's responsibility to give themselves sufficient time to secure their Zoom connection in time for voting, just as it is for any member travelling to the Senedd to vote."" On Wednesday she declined to give Mr Davies a chance to make a personal statement to the Senedd, saying as he had shared it with the media it was already in the public domain. Mr Davies later put the statement on Facebook, saying he was not able to call the presiding officer: ""I was already on a call at that time frantically speaking with Welsh Conservative staff members in an attempt to solve the ICT problems."" With the whole opposition against the plans, and Labour controlling only half of the Senedd's 60 seats, if Mr Davies voted there would have been a tie. The new law would have failed to pass as a result. Mandatory Covid passes are being introduced this coming Monday in Wales Asked about holding a re-run of the vote, Eluned Morgan told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast with Claire Summers that that is ""not how democratic processes work"". ""You don't keep on having a vote until you get the answer that you want,"" she said. ""Actually this is a system that's been in place for about four months already. People have been using it throughout the summer. ""What we know is that the people of Wales want to be protected."" ""We had a huge mandate as a result of the election because of our cautious approach."" Conservative Monmouth MS Peter Fox told the programme that a re-run ""would be a difficult thing to do"". ""Democracy has a set of processes, and you have to follow them and, you know, sometimes you don't like the outcome of the decision or the circumstances in which you've created a decision. ""But democracy is what it is and if you start eroding that where are you ending up?"" Following the vote the Welsh Conservatives called for the ending of the hybrid arrangements. But there was frustration in the party outside of the Senedd group of Tories. Tory councillor David Fouweather, of Newport, tweeted that the Conservative group should have got their whip ""sorted"", adding: ""Letting Wales down. Abolish the assembly."" Plaid Cymru's health spokesperson Rhun ap Iorwerth also rejected a re-vote. Analysis by BBC Wales political reporter Adrian Browne Parliaments, and governments, are generally reluctant to re-run votes because doing so can open a huge can of worms. Do so on this occasion and it's not hard to imagine politicians routinely queueing up for a re-vote on this or that issue, conjuring up ingenious, or not so ingenious, arguments as to why. The Senedd authorities insist there was no failure on their part to allow every Senedd member a fair chance to vote on Covid passes, and therefore there is no case for a re-match. This was down to a particular Conservative member, Gareth Davies, not doing what he needed to do to vote, they say. Mr Davies, of course, disputes this. Mistakes when voting do happen from time to time, by the way, but tend to go unnoticed by the world at large because there are usually no significant consequences. However, fifteen years ago the Labour Welsh health minister of the day, Brian Gibbons, caused great amusement bypressing the wrong button,externaland, with help from a party colleague who failed to vote with Labour, accidentally backed an an inquiry into the state of the Welsh Ambulance Service. That vote stood and all the indications are that this one will too.

"People forced to compete for appointments, GPs say","One GP surgery in Wales is receiving up to 10,000 calls every week, but can only handle 2,000 People are forced into a stressful competition for appointments when GPs' phone lines open, doctors have said. They have called on the Welsh government to fund alternative booking schemes and increase the availability of video consultations. The Royal College of GPs said the only sustainable solution to the high demand for services was investment. The Welsh government said it was ""looking at ways of using technology to improve patient booking systems"". A survey by the Office for National Statistics showed that 19% of respondents said their appointments were held over the phone in May 2020, rising to 49% between January and March this year. But doctors said that should not be seen as an inferior option and patients would always be seen in person when necessary. Will GP surgeries ever go 'back to normal'? Welsh people facing GP access crisis, says watchdog Mair Hopkin, from the Royal College of General Practitioners, said the ""crisis"" in GPs' surgeries pre-dated Covid. ""A lot of patients were finding it difficult to get an appointment before the pandemic and having to wait several weeks,"" she added. ""I have heard patients say that once the pandemic started and GPs started ringing back, patients found it so much better to speak to a GP on the day that they wanted to. ""It's not perfect, it's not right, and we have to improve things going forward but it's easy to forget how difficult it was."" Dr Rhodri Lewis said receptionists were on the sharp end while fielding calls from patients Receptionists at West Quay Medical Centre in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, said they had received a number of comments from patients including ""if I die, it's your fault"", ""you didn't deserve the 8 o'clock clap"" along with other NHS staff and ""if you tell me to call back at 8am one more time I will go nuts"". Practice managing partner Dr Rhodri Lewis said most patients ""have been great"". ""They really understand the pressures but, increasingly, it's harder and harder to say 'please bear with us and phone the next day' - when they phone the next day to be told the same thing again and again and again and we run out of options to tell them,"" he said. ""At the end of the day you have often got a broken team in telephony because they're just saying the same thing over and over again and people are understandably frustrated and take it out on them because they are the front line."" A number of surgeries have added specialists such as physiotherapists, mental health nurses and pharmacists to their teams to meet the demand, though that means more physical space is required. Gareth Thomas, business manager at West Quay and Wales' representative for the Institute of General Practice Management, said the surgery received between 9,000 and 10,000 calls weekly, but could only answer about 2,000. ""We just don't have the capacity to take the sheer amount of calls which come through to the surgery every day,"" he said. Phone appointments have allowed practices to increase their capacity, he added, but said demand ""just strips the capacity that we have every day"" with between 15 and 20% extra demand compared to before the pandemic Gareth Thomas is Wales' representative for the Institute of General Practice Management Jo Cottle is a patient at West Quay and a member of its patient participation group, which meets monthly to raise issues to improve people's experience. She said: ""Last year it was very difficult to get in here because everyone had to be protected. I think that made people quite wary and feel like they were shut out. ""They weren't but, once things started to open up and clinics began again, it felt like things were moving forward again. ""As far as I'm concerned, if they're happy to treat me over the phone and I'm happy then I'd rather not come in, especially over the winter but if I need to be seen I will."" The Welsh government said: ""Despite the pressures facing GPs, practices are open and working to meet patient needs, undertaking more appointments than ever. ""We accelerated the roll-out of the Attend Anywhere video consultation system during the Covid pandemic and since then more than 14,000 GP video consultations have been carried out. ""We have also expanded the number of training places for nurses and other healthcare professionals that make up primary care multi-disciplinary teams.""

What's prompted boost in Welsh woodland purchases?,"""We just want to get the fire going and get the tent out,"" said Iain Rich Record house prices and a lack of foreign travel may have helped an unexpected boom in one niche market. Demand for plots of woodland is reportedly soaring, with many buying land that cannot be developed. ""It's just so tranquil,"" said Iain Rich, 57, from his newly-purchased woodland in rural west Wales. ""I had my birthday party here recently, which was lovely, just a barbecue and a bottle of bubbly which we chilled down in the stream."" He and wife Helen enjoy nursing a campfire, surrounded by moss-covered oak trees dating back hundreds of years. The only noise we can hear comes from a lone buzzard circling overhead. Hide destroyed by arson for third time in a year Minister tells families to plant more trees It was disconcerting at first, when the last bar of phone signal vanished at least half a mile ago, but then it was peaceful. As idyllic as their spot is, perched at the top of an ancient tree-covered valley, this was never their plan. This video can not be played Two families explain why they decided to spend their savings on a woodland in Wales Like so many other first-time wood owners across the UK, it was the pandemic that changed their path. ""I think, in all honesty, because we've both retired, our grand plan was to travel,"" admits Helen, 57. ""We had pretty grand plans, but that came to a sudden and grinding halt with Covid."" It was Iain who then suggested the couple look at woodlands during the first lockdown, after becoming curious about for sale signs he'd spotted while out cycling. Since then they haven't looked back, buying two neighbouring plots in just a few months. It means many of their evenings and weekends are now spent battling brambles, but there are perks too. ""People who buy woodlands do it because they love it,"" said Iain. ""We get itchy feet when we haven't been. We just want to get the fire going and get the tent out."" He said they have invested about Â£80,000, but ""it's been worth it for us"". ""Probably, as an investment, for the first time in our lives, it's actually working. We have children who also love the area."" Helen added: ""We'll pass it on to the next generation and then, hopefully, they'll pass it on to next generation after that."" Expert Chris Colley said managed woodland has more biodiversity than untended sites Until the pair bought their woodland, it had been left relatively untouched and unexplored for decades. There are many vast clumps of land in private ownership, with no commercial or economic use. Companies, such as the one Iain and Helen bought from, said it was gradually acquiring huge forgotten plots and selling them off in manageable chunks to wilderness enthusiasts. Even now, more than six months after buying their site, Iain and Helen own swathes of mysterious woodland they have yet to explore. They hope hidden in the acres of brambles could be forgotten freshwater springs or clues to the woodland's use in centuries gone by. ""There is a lot of woodland across the whole of the UK, but particularly in Wales, that is undermanaged,"" explained specialist Chris Colley from Woodlands.co.uk ""Ancient woodland and more recently-planted woodland needs management. It needs tender care to maximise its environmental benefit and its value for wildlife. ""A managed wood will have more biodiversity than something that's been left alone untended."" Farming fear over plans to plant 20 million trees Developer cleared of deliberately chopping trees The business Chris works for, and others, have said that woodland sales have skyrocketed since the pandemic, with almost all stock selling out. ""Up to the start of the pandemic it was a steady business, the average wood that would go on the market would probably take two or three months to find a buyer,"" said Chris. ""Since the pandemic, that has gone down to maybe two weeks, and we're quite often putting woods on the market now and they're selling within two or three days. ""It's a huge increase in demand for somewhere to get away from the world, to get away from the pandemic and to reconnect with nature."" Katie de Silva with her children Mia and Kai For Katie de Silva, buying her small plot of woodland, nestled among towering poker-straight conifers in Pembrokeshire, was also an opportunity to reconnect her young family. ""My husband has always been a chef, and a very good one, so he's always had to work away and the kids hardly ever saw him,"" she said. ""When lockdown happened, it was amazing. We actually got to have six months together. I think it really opened up opportunities for us to become a real family again."" They had spent the first lockdown living in a flat above a shop with no outside space, so they looked into buying a patch of woodland for children Mia, nine, and Kai, six, to have ""adventures"". ""I thought it was a bit bonkers at first,"" said Katie. ""Also, we were planning to buy a house and I'd always looked for somewhere that had loads of outdoor space, but with lockdown, house prices soared. ""This has meant by having a piece of woodland, we don't actually need much of a garden."" Some woodlands can cost hundreds of thousands, but most are smaller sites costing between Â£20,000 and Â£50,000. In an effort to keep costs down, Katie's family bought their site with friends before dividing it up. The fact they made a decision to purchase during the first lockdown in March 2020, meant they were able to rely heavily on the woods when tight restrictions returned again last winter. 'Disappointing' tree planting as Wales lags behind Fundraiser launched for 'irreplaceable' woodland ""It was really tough that second lockdown,"" reflected Katie. ""This gave us a reason to get out, and to push through it, and to do something really great. ""Even in the middle of winter, when it was freezing cold, we could get the children out and they'd spend about eight hours down here digging and rolling and doing what kids do. ""You can go to the woods for free, of course, you don't need to buy one. ""We wanted to camp out and we love building things, and it's the pride in doing it, it's really important to us."" Like retirees Iain and Helen, Katie and her husband bought their wood with one eye on the future. ""It's meant to be a piece of land that stays with us,"" said Katie. ""The children can enjoy growing up here. We're all nature lovers. ""This is a culmination of everything we always wanted to have. It really means something.""

"People forced to compete for appointments, GPs sayFrustrated patients at one GP surgery tell receptionists ""if I die, it's your fault"".Wales","One GP surgery in Wales is receiving up to 10,000 calls every week, but can only handle 2,000 People are forced into a stressful competition for appointments when GPs' phone lines open, doctors have said. They have called on the Welsh government to fund alternative booking schemes and increase the availability of video consultations. The Royal College of GPs said the only sustainable solution to the high demand for services was investment. The Welsh government said it was ""looking at ways of using technology to improve patient booking systems"". A survey by the Office for National Statistics showed that 19% of respondents said their appointments were held over the phone in May 2020, rising to 49% between January and March this year. But doctors said that should not be seen as an inferior option and patients would always be seen in person when necessary. Will GP surgeries ever go 'back to normal'? Welsh people facing GP access crisis, says watchdog Mair Hopkin, from the Royal College of General Practitioners, said the ""crisis"" in GPs' surgeries pre-dated Covid. ""A lot of patients were finding it difficult to get an appointment before the pandemic and having to wait several weeks,"" she added. ""I have heard patients say that once the pandemic started and GPs started ringing back, patients found it so much better to speak to a GP on the day that they wanted to. ""It's not perfect, it's not right, and we have to improve things going forward but it's easy to forget how difficult it was."" Dr Rhodri Lewis said receptionists were on the sharp end while fielding calls from patients Receptionists at West Quay Medical Centre in Barry, Vale of Glamorgan, said they had received a number of comments from patients including ""if I die, it's your fault"", ""you didn't deserve the 8 o'clock clap"" along with other NHS staff and ""if you tell me to call back at 8am one more time I will go nuts"". Practice managing partner Dr Rhodri Lewis said most patients ""have been great"". ""They really understand the pressures but, increasingly, it's harder and harder to say 'please bear with us and phone the next day' - when they phone the next day to be told the same thing again and again and again and we run out of options to tell them,"" he said. ""At the end of the day you have often got a broken team in telephony because they're just saying the same thing over and over again and people are understandably frustrated and take it out on them because they are the front line."" A number of surgeries have added specialists such as physiotherapists, mental health nurses and pharmacists to their teams to meet the demand, though that means more physical space is required. Gareth Thomas, business manager at West Quay and Wales' representative for the Institute of General Practice Management, said the surgery received between 9,000 and 10,000 calls weekly, but could only answer about 2,000. ""We just don't have the capacity to take the sheer amount of calls which come through to the surgery every day,"" he said. Phone appointments have allowed practices to increase their capacity, he added, but said demand ""just strips the capacity that we have every day"" with between 15 and 20% extra demand compared to before the pandemic Gareth Thomas is Wales' representative for the Institute of General Practice Management Jo Cottle is a patient at West Quay and a member of its patient participation group, which meets monthly to raise issues to improve people's experience. She said: ""Last year it was very difficult to get in here because everyone had to be protected. I think that made people quite wary and feel like they were shut out. ""They weren't but, once things started to open up and clinics began again, it felt like things were moving forward again. ""As far as I'm concerned, if they're happy to treat me over the phone and I'm happy then I'd rather not come in, especially over the winter but if I need to be seen I will."" The Welsh government said: ""Despite the pressures facing GPs, practices are open and working to meet patient needs, undertaking more appointments than ever. ""We accelerated the roll-out of the Attend Anywhere video consultation system during the Covid pandemic and since then more than 14,000 GP video consultations have been carried out. ""We have also expanded the number of training places for nurses and other healthcare professionals that make up primary care multi-disciplinary teams.""

Tesco 'outperforms' with sales and profits growth,"Tesco has seen sales and profits grow faster than expected as Britain's biggest supermarket group shrugged off the pandemic impact. In the six months to August, Tesco said it ""outperformed"" the grocery sector, but also flagged that the sales surge could now start to ""fall away"". But it would still mean stronger profits growth this year than was first thought,a Tesco statement said.,external It came as rival Morrisons said it was recruiting 3,000 staff for Christmas. The jobs are in distribution centres and manufacturing sites across the UK, ranging from warehouse and production staff to pickers and packers, as well as other skilled roles such as fork-lift truck drivers. Like Morrisons, Tesco is adjusting to labour shortages and supply chain problems in the run-up to the key festive period. However, chief executive Ken Murphy said the company was ""in good shape for Christmas"", adding he believed the company's resilience was due to its ""long-standing partnerships with suppliers"". ""With various different challenges currently affecting the industry, the resilience of our supply chain and the depth of our supplier partnerships has once again been shown to be a key asset,"" he said. But he told a conference call with journalists that there would still ""be bumps in the road in the run-up to Christmas. We're seeing our share of challenges"". Analyst Sophie Lund-Yates, from investment platform Hargreaves Lansdown, said ""Tesco's enormous scale means it is weathering the supply chain crisis better than others. It is times like these when being the biggest fish in the pond really counts. ""The size of Tesco's distribution network also can't be overstated, which again gives the group the flexibility to deliver the goods at scale."" Morrisons promises 'good Christmas' for shoppers Aldi says deliveries normal despite driver shortage Tesco's group revenues jumped by 5.9% to Â£30.4bn for the six months compared with the same period last year. Operating profits increased by 28% to Â£1.3bn for the period. Sales in the first six months of Tesco's financial year rose 2.6% to Â£27.3bn, while UK like-for-like sales rose 1.2%, having risen 0.5% in the first quarter. Analysts said Tesco was benefiting from its huge online business, from a pricing strategy that matched the prices of German-owned discounter Aldi on around 650 products and the success of its Clubcard Prices loyalty scheme, which offered lower prices to members. But the company has again signalled concerns about possible food price inflation, following Tesco chairman John Allan's warning last month in an ITV interview that costs could rise by 5% this winter. Britain's biggest retailer is on a bit of a roll. Trading has been better than expected and with impressive results. Even Tesco Bank has bounced back to profitability. The retailer says it has managed to keep hold of most of the new customers it gained during the pandemic after doubling its online slots. The focus now is delivering Christmas amid a whole host of supply chain challenges. Boss Ken Murphy says Tesco is in good shape for the all-important festive trading and that the business has many unique advantages. For instance, it makes extensive use of rail to deliver supplies. Tesco sends 65,000 containers across the UK by rail every year and it wants to increase that to 90,000 in the next few months to help mitigate the shortage of drivers. Tesco's huge scale may also help it weather the storm, but Mr Murphy also expects ""bumps in the road"" ahead. Julie Palmer, partner at Begbies Traynor, said likely price rises, along with the HGV driver shortage, pointed to the future looking ""more uncertain"" for Tesco. ""The supermarket has already warned the UK government that the shortage of lorry drivers could cause severe disruption to deliveries, causing panic buying in the run-up to Christmas,"" she said. ""While this may push up sales temporarily, it also means chaos when stock runs out and rising costs for the supermarket, which it may struggle to pass on to its customers in a competitive market. ""Add supply chain disruption, an energy crisis, wage inflation and a lack of workers to the basket, Tesco has considerable headwinds in the final quarter of the year."" Meanwhile, Morrisons said it was anticipating that Christmas trading would be busier than usual as ""customers try to make up for last year's restricted celebrations"". The company said its new jobs, with pay starting at Â£10 an hour, included both permanent and temporary roles. Morrisons underlined in its statement that it ""welcomed"" 16-24-year-olds, saying that full training would be given, so ""no prior experience is required"".

Tina Turner sells music rights for reported $50m,"Tina Turner has been inducted to the Rock & Roll Hall of Fame twice Tina Turner sold the rights to her music catalogue, including hits like The Best and Nutbush City Limits, to music publishing company BMG. The deal also sees BMG acquire the rights to Turner's name, image, and likeness for future sponsorship and merchandising deals. The company did not disclose how much it paid, but industry sources said the figure would be north of $50m (Â£37m). Turner said she was confident her music was ""in reliable hands"". The 81-year-old is one of the most recognisable and vibrant stars in pop music history. Born Anna Mae Bullock in Tennessee, she joined Ike Turner's band as a backing singer when she was 18. Within two years, she was the star of the show, and the duo scored a string of hits with future R&B standards like A Fool In Love, River Deep, Mountain High and Nutbush City Limits. Ike and Tina Turner were one of the biggest soul and R&B acts of the 1960s Ike and Tina married in 1962, but their relationship was turbulent and violent and she filed for divorce in the 70s. Turner's solo career quickly eclipsed that of her partnership with Ike, with five platinum albums including 1984's Private Dancer, which went three times platinum in the UK. Tina Turner documentary is a 'farewell' to fans Her biggest hits include that record's title track, What's Love Got To Do With It, The Best, Steamy Windows and the Bond theme Goldeneye. She has received 12 Grammy Awards and will enter the Rock & Roll Hall Of Fame as a solo artist in October - her second induction after entering the pantheon with Ike Turner in 1991. The deal with BMG sees her handing over her share of the recording and publishing rights for those hits and dozens more, spanning the six decades of her career. Warner Music will remain the record company distributing the star's music. ""Tina Turner's musical journey has inspired hundreds of millions of people around the world and continues to reach new audiences,"" said BMG boss Hartwig Masuch. ""We are honoured to take on the job of managing Tina Turner's musical and commercial interests. It is a responsibility we take seriously and will pursue diligently. She is truly and simply, the best."" He said the company intended to introduce Turner's work to new audiences, particularly on streaming and music-focused social media platforms like TikTok.

""Like any artist, the protection of my life's work, my musical inheritance, is something personal,"" said Turner in a statement. ""I am confident that with BMG and Warner Music, my work is in professional and reliable hands."" The star has largely been in retirement since 2009, but interest in her work has surged thanks to the 2021 HBO documentary Tina, and a West End musical based on her life, Tina. This video can not be played Tina Turner: ""I am really proud of what my future as a star became"" She is the latest artist to cash in on the value of their back catalogue, following in the footsteps of Blondie, Shakira and Fleetwood Mac's Stevie Nicks. Universal Music Group paid somewhere near $400m (Â£295m) to acquire Bob Dylan's entire songbook last year, while Neil Young made about $150m (Â£110m) by selling a 50% share of his music to London-based investment company Hipgnosis. The deals give superstar artists and writers a guaranteed windfall, while the new owners collect royalties every time the songs are streamed, sold or placed in movies. The pandemic seems to have accelerated the trend, with rock legend David Crosby saying he was forced to sell his songs to Irving Azoff's Iconic Artists Group in March because of his ""inability to play live"". ""I can't work ... and streaming stole my record money,"" heexplained in a tweet,externalwhile the deal was being negotiated.

TikTok and Twitch face fines under new Ofcom rules,"In future platforms such as TikTok will have Ofcom keeping a close eye over how they enforce policies Ofcom has laid out the measures it will require video-sharing platforms to take to better protect users. The VSPs, including TikTok, Snapchat, Vimeo and Twitch, must take ""appropriate measures"" to protect users from  content related to terrorism, child sexual abuse and racism. A third of users have seen hateful content on such sites, Ofcom says. The regulator will fine VSPs that breach the guidelines or - in serious cases - suspend the service entirely. The VSPs will have to: provide and effectively enforce clear rules for uploading content make the reporting and complaints process easier restrict access to adult sites with robust age-verification Ofcom promised a report next year into whether those in scope - and there are 18 in total - were taking the appropriate steps. Specific legal criteria determine whether a service meets the definition of a VSP and whether it falls within UK jurisdiction. YouTube is expected to fall under the Irish regulatory regime but it will come in scope of the Online Safety Bill, which has a much broader remit to tackle online harms on the big technology platforms, such as Twitter, Facebook and Google, once that becomes law. Ofcom said one of its main priorities in the coming year would be to work with VSPs to reduce the risk of child sexual abuse material being uploaded. According to the Internet Watch Foundation, there has been a 77% increase in the amount of self-generated abuse content in 2020. Ofcom's job will not involve assessing individual videos. And it acknowledges the massive amount of content will make it impossible to prevent every instance of harm. But it promised a ""rigorous but fair"" approach to its new duties. Chief executive Dame Melanie Dawes said: ""Online videos play a huge role in our lives now, particularly for children. ""But many people see hateful, violent or inappropriate material while using them. ""The platforms where these videos are shared now have a legal duty to take steps to protect their users.""

Selling essays to students to be made illegal,"Offering essay-writing services to students for a fee will become a criminal offence under plans to tackle cheating by ""essay mills"". The government says the move will protect students from the ""deceptive marketing techniques of contract cheating services"". Providing pre-written or custom-made essays for students to present as their own is already illegal in some places. Skills minister Alex Burghart said essay mills were ""unethical"". There are more than 1,000 essay mills in operation, according to the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education, the watchdog for standards in UK universities. The agency's Gareth Crossman said the decision ""sends a clear signal"" but the higher education sector must work together to put these ""unscrupulous outfits"" out of business. 'One in seven' paying for uni essays The Kenyans who are helping the world to cheat YouTube stars paid to sell cheating 'Misleading' essay writing ads banned A 2018 survey suggested that 15.7% of recent graduates admitted to cheating, but Universities UK said that the use of essay mills by students was rare. A spokeswoman said: ""Universities have become increasingly experienced at dealing with such issues and are engaging with students from day one to underline the implications of cheating and how it can be avoided."" She added that universities welcomed the decision to make essay mills illegal, and said all universities had codes of conduct with severe penalties for submitting work that is not a student's own. Students said there should be more academic and pastoral support, so that they are ""never in the position of feeling that they have to turn to essay mills in the first place"". The National Union of Students said: ""These private companies prey on students' vulnerabilities and insecurities to make money through exploitation, and never more so than during the pandemic."" The ban on essay mills is one of a number of measures being introduced to the Skills and Post-16 Education Bill. It will also include changes to careers advice in schools intended to give equality to technical education, ensuring that pupils have opportunities to learn about apprenticeships, T-levels and traineeships.

New Zealand raises rates for first time since 2014,"New Zealand's central bank has raised interest rates for the first time in seven years as it tries to rein in property prices and inflation. The Reserve Bank of New Zealand (RBNZ) increased its cash rate by a quarter of a percentage point to 0.5%. Economists had expected the hike last month but the bank held off due to an outbreak of the Covid-19 Delta variant. New Zealand is one of the first developed economies to reverse rate cuts put in place during the pandemic. The RBNZ also said it plans to remove more stimulus measures as the economy continues to recover. ""The Committee noted that further removal of monetary policy stimulus is expected over time, with future moves contingent on the medium-term outlook for inflation and employment,"" the RBNZ said. New Zealand has recovered rapidly from a recession last year, partly because it managed to contain the coronavirus and was able to begin to reopen its economy before other countries. The RBNZ last raised the cost of borrowing at its July 2014 interest rate setting meeting. It had cut its main interest to a record low of 0.25% in March last year to help support the economy against the impact of the coronavirus pandemic. Central banks, governments and international financial bodies had slashed interest rates and pumped trillions of dollars into the global economy last year to help protect it from the effects of countries going into lockdowns and closing their borders. The hike puts New Zealand amongst a handful of developed economies that have raised borrowing costs in recent weeks as central banks look to wind back those emergency measures. In August, South Korea became the first major Asian economy to raise interest rates since the coronavirus pandemic began. The Bank of Korea increased its base rate of interest from a record low of 0.5% to 0.75%. The move was aimed at helping curb the country's household debt and home prices, which soared in recent months. Norway and the Czech Republic have also raised their borrowing costs in the last month. Other countries are also expected to hike interest rates in the coming months. These higher borrowing costs will inevitably be passed on to individuals and businesses.

Universal credit reduction: 'I feel overwhelmed',"The government says vulnerable households across the country ""will be able to access a new Â£500m support fund to help them with essentials"" A Â£20-a-week increase to universal credit (UC), brought in to help people on low incomes struggling through the Covid pandemic, is being withdrawn from Wednesday. The government has always said the extra money was going to be temporary, but MPs, pressure groups and charities have argued it should be kept in place to help those who are struggling. We asked three women how the reduction will affect their lives. Universal credit: End of the Â£20 boost explained Harriet Duffy had to stop work after being hit by a car Although the reduction in Harriet Duffy's UC payment is imminent, she can barely think about the financial impact. ""I feel overwhelmed,"" she says. ""I literally just take each day as it comes. It's been daunting."" She's been on UC since February last year. When hit by a car while cycling, Harriet fractured her leg, and was forced to leave her twin jobs as a door-to-door charity helper and call centre worker. The Â£20 uplift made a ""phenomenal difference"", she says. ""People have come to rely on it."" And the money has been all the more important in the last few months. Harriet now has a four-month-old son. ""We are currently in temporary accommodation. I'm in a hotel until the 18th, but after that I've not got a clue where I am going to be. ""The accommodation has no access to laundry facilities - I'm using launderettes and living off microwave meals. This all comes at an expense. Losing that extra bit of income will be devastating."" For a start, Harriet says she won't be able to do basic things, like go to the launderette as often. With a baby, that could be a problem. She'd like to go back to work, but with such a young baby ""it's just not possible"". ""I'm completely aware this [uplift] hasn't always been part of UC and was only supposed to be temporary,"" she says when asked for a message to the government. ""But a lot people have become reliant on it during this time."" Nicola Flower says the Â£20-a-week uplift helped pay for heating during her cancer treatment For Nicola Flower, from Cornwall, the uplift in universal credit has helped her stay warm by paying for heating bills during her cancer treatment. She told the BBC she has had to shield for a year due to the coronavirus pandemic and is still waiting for an operation. ""I had no choice but to go on it [universal credit],"" she said. ""It was a godsend because I wouldn't have managed otherwise. I have never been on benefits before in my life. I have always done three jobs."" Nicola, who worked as a seamstress, in a supermarket and as a cleaner, said the she knew the Â£20 uplift was ""an extra"", but added with fuel prices and gas prices rising, she could do with the money. ""When I was going through my treatment I was quite ill and I needed the heating on day and night so it allowed me to pay for that, otherwise I don't know what I would have done to be quite honest,"" she said. ""I would have gone into debt."" ""I was quite ill, especially with the chemotherapy,"" she adds. She also suffers issues with her joints and fears the problem could get worse when it gets colder. ""I will need the heating on to keep my joints warm."" Nicola said she knows she ""physically"" cannot go back to doing three jobs and isn't sure if she could go back to two. ""If I had to go back to doing one job, my lifestyle would have to change dramatically,"" she said. ""I have no options at the moment, I'm not fit to go back to work."" She said the government had ""not got a clue how the average person manages, lives, survives"". ""I don't think half of them know how much a pint of milk is,"" she added. Deirdre McCausland says she is concerned about how the reduction in UC will affect her children Deirdre McCausland was a secondary school teacher in England before moving to Northern Ireland. She thought she could get a job but ""fell into the benefits trap"". Deirdre said the Â£20-a-week UC uplift made a ""massive"" difference to her. Her daughter may not have been able to go to grammar school without the extra cash. ""It got to the point where if I hadn't had the Â£20 extra, I was contemplating putting her into a school where perhaps it was closer and the uniform was cheaper,"" she said. Deirdre's daughter needs to get the bus, but doesn't qualify for a weekly bus pass. ""As you can imagine, the money [Â£20] goes a long way,"" Deirdre says. Her daughter wants to pursue a career in music, and the money is helping to pay for her piano and guitar lessons. ""That's what she wants to do in later life, and I may have to take something away from her. It will gall me to have to say to her: 'I need to make cutbacks',"" Deirdre says. The reduction ""will have a massive impact on my children"", she adds. ""When government is deciding these things, they don't speak to real people with real experiences. They don't realise the impact that will have on children."" She says there is a ""domino effect"" which means a reduction in benefits leads to debt, effects on adult and child mental health, and it perpetuates poverty. A government spokesman said: ""We've always been clear that the uplift to Universal Credit was temporary. ""It was designed to help claimants through the economic shock and financial disruption of the toughest stages of the pandemic, and it has done so. ""Universal credit will continue to provide vital support for those both in and out of work and it's right that the government should focus on our Plan for Jobs, supporting people back into work and supporting those already employed to progress and earn more.""

Essay-writing companies to be made illegal,"Offering essay-writing services to students for a fee will become a criminal offence under plans to tackle cheating by ""essay mills"". The government says the move will protect students from the ""deceptive marketing techniques of contract cheating services"". Providing pre-written or custom-made essays for students to present as their own is already illegal in some places. Skills minister Alex Burghart said essay mills were ""unethical"". There are more than 1,000 essay mills in operation, according to the Quality Assurance Agency for Higher Education, the watchdog for standards in UK universities. The agency's Gareth Crossman said the decision ""sends a clear signal"" but the higher education sector must work together to put these ""unscrupulous outfits"" out of business. 'One in seven' paying for uni essays The Kenyans who are helping the world to cheat YouTube stars paid to sell cheating 'Misleading' essay writing ads banned A 2018 survey suggested that 15.7% of recent graduates admitted to cheating, but Universities UK said that the use of essay mills by students was rare. A spokeswoman said: ""Universities have become increasingly experienced at dealing with such issues and are engaging with students from day one to underline the implications of cheating and how it can be avoided."" She added that universities welcomed the decision to make essay mills illegal, and said all universities had codes of conduct with severe penalties for submitting work that is not a student's own. Students said there should be more academic and pastoral support, so that they are ""never in the position of feeling that they have to turn to essay mills in the first place"". The National Union of Students said: ""These private companies prey on students' vulnerabilities and insecurities to make money through exploitation, and never more so than during the pandemic."" The ban on essay mills is one of a number of measures being introduced to the Skills and Post-16 Education Bill. It will also include changes to careers advice in schools intended to give equality to technical education, ensuring that pupils have opportunities to learn about apprenticeships, T-levels and traineeships.
