MPs promised more Brexit votes,"This video can not be played Housing and Communities Secretary James Brokenshire on securing ""seamless border"" in Ireland MPs will get another chance to vote on Brexit this month - even if Theresa May has not been able to negotiate a deal by then. Housing Secretary James Brokenshire admitted it might not be the final, decisive vote on the PM's deal that Labour and some Tories are demanding. The prime minister needs to get a deal approved by Parliament by 29 March to avoid a no-deal Brexit. Labour has accused her of ""cynically"" running down the clock. Instead of a ""meaningful"" vote on the prime minister's deal with the EU, MPs could be given another series of non-binding votes on possible Brexit alternatives by 27 February, with the final vote on whether to approve or reject the deal delayed until the following month. On Wednesday, Mrs May will ask MPs for more time to get legally-binding changes to the controversial Northern Irish backstop, which she believes will be enough to secure a majority in Parliament for her deal. Brexit: What could happen next? Brexit: A really simple guide But the following day, Labour will attempt to force the government to hold the final, ""meaningful vote"" on Mrs May's Brexit deal by 26 February. Mr Brokenshire refused to commit to this date in an interview with the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, saying there could be more votes on amendments to the proposed deal instead. ""If the meaningful vote has not happened, so in other words things have not concluded, then Parliament would have that further opportunity by no later than 27 February,"" said Mr Brokenshire. ""I think that gives that sense of timetable, clarity and purpose on what we are doing with the EU - taking that work forward and our determination to get a deal - but equally knowing that role that Parliament very firmly has."" May says she can get Brexit deal through What's behind Corbyn's Brexit letter to May? New ideas for the Brexit border backstop He also ruled out removing the Irish backstop from the government's deal with the EU, as some Conservative MPs are demanding. He said ministers were exploring a possible time-limit to the backstop, or a legal mechanism allowing the UK to exit the backstop without the agreement of the EU, but he insisted some kind of ""insurance policy"" was needed to keep the Irish border free-flowing. Please upgrade your browser But Labour's shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, says he believes the prime minister is ""pretending to make progress"" on the Irish backstop issue. He says what she actually intends to do is return to Parliament after the 21/22 March European Council summit the week before Brexit and offer MPs a ""binary choice"" - her deal or no deal. ""We can't allow that to happen,"" Sir Keirtold The Sunday Times,external. ""There needs to be a day when Parliament says that's it, enough is enough."" Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said delaying the final vote on the Brexit deal was ""worse than irresponsible"" and he ""would not be surprised if [Theresa May] faces a massive rebellion by Conservative MPs"". Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston, who like Sir Vince has campaigned for another EU referendum, called for ministers who were ""serious"" about preventing a no-deal Brexit to resign and vote against the government. Fellow Conservative MP Heidi Allen also called for ministerial resignations, saying it was ""completely irresponsible"" for the government to keep delaying the final Brexit vote.

Labour is proposing its own Brexit plan, which would involve the UK staying in a customs union with the EU, which they say could get the backing of a majority of MPs. The government has not ruled out supporting this - and has promised a formal response to it and further talks with Labour - but they say it would prevent the UK from making its own trade deals after Brexit. Theresa May and her husband Philip arriving at a church service on Sunday There are fewer than 50 days until Brexit. The law is already in place which means the UK will leave the EU on 29 March 2019. Mrs May's Brexit deal - which she spent months negotiating and had agreed with the EU - covers the terms of the UK's divorce and the framework of future relations. But it was rejected by the UK Parliament and if it is not approved by Brexit day, the default position would be a no-deal Brexit. Last month, Parliament voted in favour of an amendment that supported most of the PM's deal but called forbackstop- which is a last-resort option to prevent a hard border in Ireland - to be replaced with ""alternative arrangements"". The prime minister is now in talks with Brussels to seek these changes to the backstop. A number of government ministers will also be meeting their counterparts across the continent this week, in order to underline Mrs May's determination to achieve a deal. What effect has Brexit had on the UK economy? No-deal Brexit ferry contract scrapped What preparations are being made for a no-deal? Critics of the backstop in Mrs May's current deal say they could tie the UK to EU rules indefinitely or mean Northern Ireland ends up under a different system to the rest of the UK. But the Irish government and the EU have repeatedly rejected calls for changes. Other options likely to be debated by MPs on Thursday include extendingArticle 50, the legal mechanism taking the UK out of the EU on 29 March, to allow more time to reach an agreement with Brussels.

May replies to Corbyn's Brexit demands,"Theresa May will update MPs on Tuesday about recent Brexit talks as she continues to seek support for her deal. She visited Dublin and Brussels last week seeking EU agreement on changes to the backstop - the ""insurance"" policy to avoid the return of visible Northern Ireland border checks. Last month MPs - who will debate Brexit on Thursday - voted for the PM to find alternatives to the current backstop. But the EU has said it would not renegotiate the withdrawal agreement. However, efforts to come up with a solution acceptable to both sides continue. Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay met a group of Tory MPs working on possible alternatives to the backstop, before he travelled to Brussels and held talks with EU negotiator Michel Barnier. Following the meeting, Mr Barnier said the talks had been ""constructive"", but added it was ""clear from our side we're not going to reopen the withdrawal agreement, but we will continue our discussions in the coming days"". A statement from the Department for Exiting the European Union said Mr Barclay and Mr Barnier had agreed to further talks ""in the coming days"". Their teams would continue to work in the meantime ""on finding a way forward"", it added. Brexit: What could happen next? Brexit: A really simple guide What's behind Corbyn's Brexit letter to May? New ideas for the Brexit border backstop UK signs trade deal with Switzerland The statement to the House of Commons on Tuesday - a day earlier than had been expected - follows an exchange of letters between Mrs May and Jeremy Corbyn. The Labour leader wrote to the PM on Wednesday,externalwith a list of five demands to secure his party's support for her deal, including a permanent customs union. The prime minister struck a conciliatory tone in her response overnight and said she looked forward to the two parties meeting again ""as soon as possible"" to discuss ways forward on Brexit. But No 10 said it rejected any proposals to remain in a customs union with the EU. Some of her cabinet members also quashed the idea, with International Trade Secretary Liam Fox calling Mr Corbyn's proposal a ""dangerous delusion"". Mrs May told the Labour leader: ""It is good to see that we agree that the UK should leave the European Union with a deal and that the urgent task at hand is to find a deal that honours our commitments to the people of Northern Ireland, can command support in Parliament and can be negotiated with the EU - not to seek an election or second referendum."" This is despite Mr Corbyn repeatedly saying there should be a general election if Mrs May cannot get a deal through Parliament. He has also faced pressure from some of his MPs to push for another public vote on Brexit. Shadow Brexit Secretary Keir Starmer said his ""key question"" about Mrs May's response was: ""Is she prepared to move her red lines and find a consensus?"" ""I don't see that in the letter,"" he said. ""The point of the exercise was to say, look, there is a majority for a close economic relationship, if you're prepared to try to find it, and I've said for some time we should test that by having a vote on a customs union.""

Labour MP David Lammy - who supports the ""People's Vote"" campaign for a new referendum - said Mrs May's letter ""makes it clear there is no hope of her agreeing"" with Mr Corbyn's demands and said his party should campaign now for a fresh vote. But fellow Labour MP Lisa Nandy told the BBC's Politics Live that there were between 40 and 60 of her colleagues ""who are actively looking for ways to support"" a revised Brexit deal. She said the government needed to ""get serious"" about policy on a customs union and guarantee to ""legislate for the protections around workers' rights"". This video can not be played Lisa Nandy says 40 to 60 Labour MPs âactively looking for ways to support"" a new Brexit deal The anti-Brexit Liberal Democrats said it was ""astonishing"" the two leaders were starting ""serious discussions about delivering disastrous Brexit together"" 900 days after the vote to leave the EU. Brexit spokesman Tom Brake added: ""It is time for Jeremy Corbyn to give up the letters and instead draw his attention to Labour Party policy and get behind the campaign for a People's Vote."" The GMB union criticised the government's ""dangerous brinkmanship"" after Mrs May rejected remaining in a customs union. It has urged the extension of Article 50 - the mechanism by which the UK is set to leave the EU on 29 March. Meanwhile, speaking in Luxembourg, Mr Barnier said he would judge how interested the UK was in changes to the accompanying political declaration, which sketches out the shape of the future relationship. He said the EU was waiting for a clear and stable majority to emerge in the House of Commons, not just for the passage of the withdrawal agreement, but for the subsequent legislation too. Mr Corbyn's letter to the prime minister was ""interesting in tone and substance"", Mr Barnier said. Elsewhere, members of the Alternative Arrangements Working Group - including Conservative MPs Steve Baker, Marcus Fysh, Owen Paterson, Damian Green and Nicky Morgan - met government officials in Westminster. Mr Baker said the talks had been ""constructive"" and they were ""looking forward to hearing how Stephen Barclay gets on with Michel Barnier"". The group has met several times to discuss alternative arrangements to the proposed Irish border ""backstop"". By Norman Smith, BBC assistant political editor It could have been a very different sort of letter. Mrs May could have just underscored her red lines: No to extending Article 50. No to another referendum. No to a customs union. Instead, it's a much more conciliatory and consensual letter. There's praise for Mr Corbyn in accepting the priority now should be on reaching a Brexit deal, rather than pressing for a general election. Praise too for his acknowledgement that the backstop has got to be changed. And there's some movement on employment rights and the promise of more cash for hard pressed communities. Even on the customs union - their key dividing area - Mrs May's language is more nuanced, even though privately her aides insist there can be no question of accepting a permanent customs union. It's unlikely to be anywhere near enough to win over Mr Corbyn. But it may be enough for those Labour MPs in leave supporting constituencies, who are looking for political cover to back or abstain on Mrs May's deal. In his letter, Mr Corbyn asked for five changes to be made to the Brexit deal. The Labour leader called for a ""permanent and comprehensive UK-wide customs union"" with the EU to be introduced to the deal, with the same external tariff. He said it would give the UK a say on any future trade deals that the EU may strike. In her reply, Mrs May said the political declaration - the second part of her deal which is a non-legally binding statement on the future relationship between the UK and EU - ""explicitly provides for the benefits of a customs union"", with no tariffs, fees, charges and restrictions. The customs union explained What is Labour's customs union policy? But, she said, it also allows for the UK to strike up its own trade deals elsewhere. She added her reassurance that securing frictionless trade with the EU was ""one of our key negotiating objectives"". Speaking in Switzerland, where Mr Fox has just signed a deal to see the country trade with the UK on the same terms it does now, the minister said the idea was ""not workable"". Mr Corbyn also wanted the deal to include a promise for the UK to be closely aligned with the Single Market after it leaves the EU, ""underpinned by shared institutions and obligations"". Mrs May quoted the EU as saying the current deal provides for the closest relationship possible outside the Single Market. She added: ""I am not sure what exactly you mean when you say 'shared institutions and obligations', but our teams can explore that."" The single market explained The PM also repeated the EU's warning that completely frictionless trade is only possible if the UK stays in the Single Market. ""This would mean accepting free movement, which Labour's 2017 General Election manifesto made clear you do not support,"" she added. Please upgrade your browser Labour has called for the UK to stay in step with the EU on rights and protections for workers, which was included in Mr Corbyn's letter. On this point, Mrs May said the government had already made commitments on workers' rights, adding: ""We are examining opportunities to provide further financial support to communities that feel left behind."" This could be referring toproposals that were said to have been discussed earlier this month from a group of Labour MPs in predominantly Leave-supporting constituencies,to allocate more funds to their communities for big infrastructure projects. The PM also said that while she had ""always been clear that Brexit should not be at the expense of workers' rights or environmental protections"", she did not support automatically following EU rules in these areas. The Labour leader called for a promise to participate in EU agencies and funding programmes on the environment, education and industry regulation after Brexit. The prime minister said the government supports participation in EU programmes in a number of areas, as set out in the political declaration - which includes areas such as science and innovation, youth, culture and education, and overseas development. Finally, Mr Corbyn demanded agreements with the EU on security, such as access to the European Arrest Warrant database. Mrs May said the government ""shares your ambition in relation to security arrangements"". She said the political declaration secured agreement on the exchange of Passenger Name Record, DNA, fingerprint and vehicle registration data and on arrangements ""akin to the European Arrest Warrant to surrender suspected and convicted persons efficiently and expeditiously."" But, she added, there is a challenge that as a third country outside of the EU, there are restrictions on the UK's ability to participate in some EU tools and measures.

Impact of Brexit on UK economy,"Economic growth has not been disastrous, but nor has it been sparkling There may still be more than a month to go until Brexit is scheduled to happen, but there has already been some fallout from the decision to leave. Most recently, the prolonged uncertainty - what the governor of the Bank of England refers to as the ""Brexit fog"" - appears to be leaving some potentially worrying scars on prosperity. What is clear, however, is that two-and-a-half years after the referendum, the most dire predictions about what could have happened to financial wellbeing have failed to transpire. Rewind to May 2016. The then chancellor, George Osborne, warned of what he said would happen over the immediate period of two years following a vote to leave the EU. He said: ""A vote to leave would represent an immediate and profound shock to our economy. That shock would push our economy into a recession and lead to an increase in unemployment of around 500,000, ""GDP would be 3.6% smaller, average real wages would be lower, inflation higher, sterling weaker, house prices would be hit and public borrowing would rise compared with a vote to remain."" He was assuming Article 50, the process by which the UK leaves, would be triggered immediately after the vote; in the event, it was nine months later. But the warning stands. Project Fear?  Well, the economy hasn't contracted, and the level of unemployment is actually the lowest on record. But that's not to say that the economy's path hasn't deviated from what had earlier been expected. Of course, there are other issues that will have influenced our economy's path - but the anticipation of the UK leaving the EU is far from insignificant. Let's start with prosperity. The economy has grown at an average of about 1.5% per year since the referendum - not sparkling, but not disastrous either. Average real wages are rising again. But most forecasters had hoped for more. The governor of the Bank of England said last May that households were Â£900 worse off compared with what it had expected pre-referendum. Since then, the gulf between those predictions and reality has widened, because of the prolonged uncertainty over the Brexit outcome. Retail spending slowed sharply towards the end of last year, while surveys suggest new orders have stagnated, such that activity in manufacturing has been driven largely by companies speeding up production to avert the risk of disruption after 29 March. The Bank of England found that business investment has slowed sharply, and reckons it will fall by even more this year. Companies are unwilling to flash the cash until they are confident about what lies ahead. That's not just down to a lack of clarity over Brexit, but a result, too, of weaker demand from elsewhere, as the likes of China and Europe slow down. As a result, the Bank now calculates the total level of GDP is about 1.2% lower than it had expected three years ago. Lower business investment tends to hamper how efficient we can be - that is productivity - and so could have a lingering impact on our economic health. And the reluctance to spend on buildings and equipment might help explain why employment is at a record high - one of the brightest spots in our economy. After the crisis, firms hung on to workers rather than invest in major projects, as it was the cheaper and more flexible option. They may be doing the same again. And while incomes in real terms, once the cost of living is accounted for, are on the rise, they remain lower on average than ahead of the financial crisis. Pay rises have been sluggish, but higher-than-expected inflation has also played a part, in particular in 2017. Prices that year rose by close to 3%, almost twice as much as expected pre-referendum. A higher cost of living means budgets don't stretch as far. That rise in inflation largely reflected a drop in the exchange rate in the aftermath of the referendum - which meant that sterling is worth about 10% less than it was previously. That led to a corresponding rise in the cost of many imports. A weaker pound may mean it's more expensive for UK holidaymakers to venture abroad - but on the upside, it makes the UK a more attractive destination.  A record 39.2 million overseas visitors came to the UK in 2017, spending Â£24.5bn. In theory, too, a weaker pound makes UK exports more attractive.  Sales to overseas customers were stronger than anticipated pre-referendum - but they rose by less than would have been expected. And surveys over the last couple of months have suggested export orders have dried up, perhaps as customers fear a no-deal scenario could spell delay and extra charges on delivery. What happens when the ""Brexit fog"" lifts? The government has hinted at hopes of a ""deal dividend"" - businesses and consumers going ahead with the spending that they may have been holding back. It'll take a while to fathom if that has happened - and then it'll be time to start looking at the impact of Brexit itself.

'Appalling' for MP to block FGM bill,"Liz Truss said she wants to change Sir Christopher's mind A Conservative MP's decision to block a bill protecting girls from female genital mutilation was ""appalling"" and he must change his mind, Treasury minister Liz Truss has said. Sir Christopher Chope provoked outrage aftershouting ""object""during a debate on anti-FGM legislation last week. Ms Truss said she will ""look for him around the Commons"" to talk it over. Communities Secretary James Brokenshire said the government is ""looking urgently"" at how to get the law passed. Appearing on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Brokenshire said Sir Christopher's own Conservative association was investigating, adding: ""I think that's the best place for this to be dealt with."" Councillor Ray Bryan, chairman of the Christchurch and East Dorset Conservative Association, said he has called an executive meeting about the issue for later this week and he will speak to Sir Christopher then. MP under fire for blocking anti-FGM bill FGM: What is it? FGM 'increasingly performed on UK babies' Sir Christopher's objection - which happened in Friday's debate in the Commons - has already been heavily criticised by cross-party MPs. Sir Christopher argued his aim was to stop badly thought-out legislation. He said he had not been objecting to the substance of the issue, but wanted to see all legislation properly debated. It is not the first time Sir Christopher has come under fire for objecting. He previously infuriated campaigners byobjecting to a ban on upskirting last year. Theresa May said she was ""disappointed"" when Sir Christopher blocked the upskirting bill last June Speaking on Sky News' Sophy Ridge on Sunday, Chief Secretary to the Treasury Liz Truss said: ""When I see one of my colleagues opposing a measure which could have saved girls' lives, could have saved girls from that horrendous experience, I'm absolutely appalled. ""I'm going to be speaking to him this week. I want to see him change his mind, I want to see the Conservative Party make sure that we show that that is completely unacceptable."" She added: ""I think Conservatives do need to put peer pressure on our colleagues who are stopping these types of things happening."" Meanwhile, asked by the BBC's Andrew Marr whether he was proud to be Sir Christopher's colleague, Mr Brokenshire said: ""I'm just hugely disappointed. ""I understand that Christopher feels a lot about the process issues, about debate, about the way Parliament operates. ""But on this, I hope he will even reflect because this is a hugely sensitive and serious issue."" This video can not be played Brokenshire: 'Shocking' that Chope blocked FGM bill Mr Brokenshire reiterated what the government's Chief Whip, Julian Smith,had tweeted,externalon Friday, saying work is being done to bring back the FGM bill in government time. The private member's bill on Friday, brought by crossbench peer Lord Berkley of Knighton, would have allowed the courts to make interim care orders under the Children Act, in cases where children are believed to be at risk of FGM. The bill had already cleared the House of Lords. But parliamentary rules mean it only requires one MP to shout ""object"" to a private member's bill which is listed for a second reading but not debated to block its progress. The BBC's parliamentary correspondent Mark D'Arcy said with a lot of private members' bills in the queue for consideration in Parliament, this one was unlikely to become law unless the government got behind it or decided to attach it to another piece of legislation. Earlier this month,a woman who mutilated her three-year-old daughterbecame the first person in the UK to be found guilty of FGM.

Mike Ashley cancels Patisserie Valerie bid,"Mike Ashley's Sports Direct has cancelled a bid for collapsed cafe chain Patisserie Valerie, just two days after making an offer. The retail billionaireannounced his bid for the chainon Friday evening. Sports Direct offered Â£15m, but was told by administrator KPMG it would need to offer up to Â£2m more than this,according to the Financial Times.,external Patisserie Valerie collapsed last month. KPMG closed 70 outlets, but kept 121 open in the hope of selling them. Mr Ashley is thought to be facing several competing bids for Patisserie Valerie, including, according to reports, from Costa, the coffee chain bought by Coca-Cola last year. The retail tycoon, who also owns English Premier League football club Newcastle United, made his name building budget chain Sports Direct into Britain's biggest sporting goods retailer. Mike Ashley bids for Patisserie Valerie Mike Ashley: The saviour of the High Street? What is Mike Ashley's plan for the High Street? He has since become known for buying up struggling retail chains and bought both department store chain House of Fraser and cycle shop Evans out of administration last year. Sports Direct's sprawling High Street empire also includes lingerie chain Agent Provocateur as well as shareholdings in Debenhams, French Connection and Game Digital. Last week, it emerged as front runner to buy Sofa.com. Patisserie Valerie collapsed after an accounting scandal which left the firm without enough money to pay its debts. Rescue talks with banks HSBC and Barclays to restructure the business broke down, leaving no option but administration. The cafe chain employed about 3,000 staff, but some 900 jobs were lost in the initial wave of closures after KPMG was appointed to run the business on 22 January. The first cafe was opened on Frith Street in London's Soho district in 1926 In 1987 the Scalzo family bought the Old Compton Street store and ran the business In 2006, Luke Johnson's Risk Capital Partners bought a majority stake when it had eight stores.

Missing Libby's parents attend prayer service,"Lisa Squire, the mother of missing student Libby Squire, at the Hull church service The parents of missing university student Libby Squire attended a prayer vigil as the search for their daughter entered its tenth day. The University of Hull student, 21, disappeared on 31 January after a night out in the city. A 24-year-old man arrested on suspicion of abduction on Wednesday at a house in Hull, near to where Ms Squire was last seen, remains in police custody. Earlier, police removed evidence bags from the Raglan Street property. Libby's mum Lisa Squire was seen hugging a police officer as she left the Hull Community Church following the vigil on Sunday morning. Mrs Squire and her husband, Russ, had previously made emotional pleas for information about their daughter's disappearance. Humberside Police can detain the arrested man until 21:00 GMT after being granted an extra 24 hours to question him on Saturday night. Appeals to find Libby, from High Wycombe, Buckinghamshire, have been displayed on digital screens in Hull city centre over the weekend. Police said the appeal for information was being broadcast on 20 screens in the main shopping areas. Thousands of flyers printed in English, Arabic, Russian, Lithuanian and Polish have also been handed out asking for information. Humberside Police officers removed evidence from a house in Hull where a man was arrested on Wednesday It is understood that police are examining CCTV footage, obtained by ITV News, which appears to show a man getting in and out of a car minutes after the last sighting of the missing philosophy student. Det Supt Mathew Hutchinson said on Saturday: ""We are still treating Libby's disappearance as a missing persons inquiry. ""I have said previously that we are keeping an open mind as to her whereabouts and that is still very much the case."" Detectives believe Ms Squire went home in a taxi at about 23:30 on 31 January but did not enter her house. Ms Squire, who is 5ft 7in tall and has long dark brown hair, was wearing a black leather jacket, black long-sleeved top and a black denim skirt with lace when she went missing.

Labour probes branch over MP 'bullying',"Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson has said a local party branch is being investigated over its alleged treatment of MP Luciana Berger. Mr Watson accused Liverpool Wavertree branch members of ""bullying"" the MP and trying to drive her out. The branch scrapped a meeting to discuss a no-confidence motion in Ms Berger after an angry backlash. It said it had ""no control"" over motions tabled by members and rejected claims of bullying and anti-Semitism. Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, Mr Watson said: ""That motion should never have been moved in her local party, the meeting to hear it should never have been scheduled."" No-confidence vote in Labour MP pulled Labour row over MP no-confidence vote He said Mr Corbyn had ""made it clear these things are not done in his name"", and they ""are not helping him, they are harming the reputation of the Labour Party"". Mr Watson added: ""I don't want any MP or any member of the Labour Party to feel they're being bullied and driven out, and what's happening to her is completely unacceptable, which is why I called for the local party to be suspended."" Labour's general secretary Jennie Formby saidthere was ""no constitutional basis"" on which to suspend the local party,external, but Mr Watson confirmed that Ms Formby was ""investigating members in that constituency"". Butin a letter to the branch,external, Ms Formby said she was had seen no evidence of behaviour that would constitute anti-Semitism or bullying in the case of Wavertree, but one individual was being investigated. In a statement, the leaders of Wavertree Labour Party said: ""We as an executive have always and continue now to express total solidarity with Luciana as a victim of misogyny and of anti-Semitism - coming mostly from the far right. ""Our chair is himself Jewish and the suggestion that the CLP (Constituency Labour Party) Executive is in any way a party to bullying and anti-Semitism is a false and slanderous accusation."" They defended scheduling a meeting to discuss the no-confidence motions, saying it was ""to give our MP the maximum opportunity to take part when the motions were debated"". The executive added that they ""strongly reject the media inaccuracies and the accusations of political bullying, for simply adhering to party rules and doing our jobs"". Ms Berger, who is Jewish, has been an outspoken critic of the party's handling of anti-Semitism allegations and its stance on Brexit. The motion that was pulled criticised her for ""continually using the media to criticise"" Jeremy Corbyn. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell sparked a backlash from some Labour MPs after he suggested on Friday that the move against Ms Berger was more to do with her disloyalty to the leadership than anti-Semitism. He urged Ms Berger to publicly reject claims she supported a Labour ""breakaway"", amid media speculation MPs disenchanted with Mr Corbyn's leadership were planning to form a new party. This video can not be played Tom Watson: ""I know one MP who changed their vote because they were frightened"" On speculation about Labour MPs forming a new party, Mr Watson said ""we are all worried about a breakaway because we need unity in order to win the next general election"". Speaking more broadly about the abuse MPs have had to put up with amid the ""hate-fuelled debate around Brexit"", Mr Watson told Andrew Marr he knew of ""an MP who had changed their vote because they were frightened"". Update 12 February 2019: This article has been updated to explain that Jennie Formby sent a letter to Liverpool Wavertree branch later that day in which she said she had seen no evidence of any behaviours constituting potential bullying or anti-Semitism, other than complaints about one individual which were being investigated.

Madrid mass protest over Catalonia talks,"This video can not be played Protesters angered by the government's outreach to Catalan separatists call for new elections in Spain Supporters of Spanish conservative and centrist parties have held a protest in Madrid against government plans to hold talks with Catalan separatists. The centre-right Popular Party (PP) and Ciudadanos (Citizens) say Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez's plan to appoint an intermediary for the talks amounts to treason. The separatists have rejected the offer - they want a new independence vote. Like the right, the ruling Socialists also oppose Catalan independence. Far-right groups including the Vox party are also present at the protest, held under the slogan ""For a united Spain. Elections now!"" Catalan crisis in 300 words Catalonia: What would an economic split mean? Protesters filled the Spanish capital's Colon Square and nearby streets, many of them chanting ""long live Spain"". Police put the total number of demonstrators at 45,000. They say the government's offer to separatists to hold round table talks and appoint a special rapporteur amounts to a capitulation and they want elections scheduled for 2020 brought forward. The far-right Vox party is also part of the protest - its president Santiago Abascal seen here One protester, Mabel Campuzano, told Reuters news agency that Mr SÃ¡nchez was ""betraying Spain and we think that Spaniards don't deserve him as the president of the government"". In a speech, PP leader Pablo Casado denounced Mr SÃ¡nchez's policies as ""Socialist surrender"" and ""deals under the table"", Efe news agency reports. ""SÃ¡nchez's time is over,"" Mr Casado said, adding that the protests were a turning point and the beginning of a return to ""harmony and legality"" in Spain. Speaking shortly afterwards at a local election campaign meeting, Mr SÃ¡nchez said his Socialist party had always been on the side of dialogue, and was now attempting to resolve a crisis made worse by the PP while it was in power. On Friday the government said the separatists had rejected its framework for talks. This video can not be played What happened to Catalonia? One year on Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo said the situation had ""stalled"", as separatist calls for an independence referendum were ""not acceptable"". Meanwhile the separatists accused the government itself of abandoning dialogue. Mr SÃ¡nchez heads a minority government that relies on the support of other parties including Catalan nationalists. His government faces a key vote on Wednesday on its proposed 2019 budget - failure to approve it could lead to a snap election. Catalan nationalist parties have said that their support for the budget depends on whether Mr Sanchez's proposed talks with separatists include the issue of independence. Mr SÃ¡nchez has, however, ruled out the possibility of a Catalan independence referendum. Polls show that the PP, Ciudadanos and Vox would together win a majority in a general election. In Decemberthe three parties together won power in the southern region of Andalusia, ousting the Socialists, who had been in power there for 36 years. Catalan nationalists regained power in Barcelona in May, after a seven-month period of direct rule by Madrid. Mr SÃ¡nchez became prime minister the following month, making negotiations with the pro-independence movement his priority. Tensions remain high, as many Catalans resent Madrid's show of force last year, when it charged pro-independence leaders with sedition. Some of them are due to go on trial on Tuesday and face up to 25 years in prison. In December Catalan premier Quim Torra irritated the Spanish government by praising Slovenia's successful path to independence. It broke away from Yugoslavia in 1991, after a 10-day war.

Dating apps 'must not risk child safety',"Dating apps Grindr and Tinder are to be asked to explain to the government how they protect children, after an investigation claimed minors are put at risk of sexual exploitation. More than 30 cases of child rape have been investigated by police since 2015 after victims evaded age checks on such apps,the Sunday Times found,external. Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright described it as ""truly shocking"". Grindr and Tinder both said they have measures to prevent minors using them. A Freedom of Information request by the Sunday Times also showed 60 further instances of child sex offences - including grooming, kidnapping and violent assault - through online dating services. The youngest victim was eight years old, the paper said. Mr Wright said the investigation produced ""yet more evidence that online tech firms must do more to protect children"". He said he plans to write to Tinder and Grindr to ask ""what measures they have in place to keep children safe from harm, including verifying their age."" ""If I'm not satisfied with their response, I reserve the right to take further action,"" he said. Legislation coming into effect from April, whichrequires porn sites to use age verification technology,may now be extended to dating apps, he said. Last week Instagram vowed toremove all self-harm imagesfrom the social media platform. The move comes after the father of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life in 2017, said Instagramhad ""helped kill"" his daughter. Molly's family found she had been viewing graphic images of self-harm on the site prior to her death. A spokeswoman for Tinder said the platform used automated and manual tools and ""spend millions of dollars annually"" to prevent and remove underage users and other inappropriate behaviour and they ""don't want minors on Tinder"". In a statement to the Sunday Times, Grindr said: ""Any account of sexual abuse or other illegal behaviour is troubling to us as well as a clear violation of our terms of service. ""Our team is constantly working to improve our digital and human screening tools to prevent and remove improper underage use of our app."" Earlier this week, aman was jailed for two-and-a-half years for sexual activity with a 12-year-old girlwho he said he thought was 19. Carl Hodgson, 28, invited the child, who he made contact with on a dating app, to his flat and sent images of her in a body stocking to a friend via WhatsApp. Manchester Crown Court was told Hodgson filmed the girl on his phone and also carried out a sex act while she looked on.

Search for Shackleton's lost ship begins,"Endurance just before it sank: Crushed at the stern, it went down bow first Antarctic scientists seeking to locate the wreck of Sir Ernest Shackleton's lost ship, the Endurance, have arrived at the search site. The team broke through thick pack-ice on Sunday to reach the vessel's last known position in the Weddell Sea. Robotic submersibles will now spend the next few days scouring the ocean floor for the maritime icon. Shackleton and his crew had to abandon Endurance in 1915 when it was crushed by sea-ice and sank in 3,000m of water. Their escape across the frozen floes on foot and in lifeboats is an extraordinary story that has resonated down the years - and makes the wooden polar yacht perhaps the most sought-after of all undiscovered wrecks. Major expedition targets Thwaites Glacier UK team drills record Antarctic hole New map traces Shackleton's footsteps The British-led Weddell Sea Expedition,externalhas given itself five days to find the sunken remains. This video can not be played Prof Julian Dowdeswell: ""The autonomous vehicle has a number of different sensors"" Operating from the South African ice-breaker, the SA Agulhas II, the team's plan is to put down an autonomous underwater vehicle (AUV) to map the seafloor for anomalies. A wide box has been designated, and the robot, equipped with side-scan sonar and other technologies, will run back and forth across this search zone like a lawnmower. The first dive, initiated on Sunday, will last roughly 45 hours. The SA Agulhas II will have to keep holes in the sea-ice open to operate the subs There will be no attempt to retrieve artefacts should the Endurance be found. The intention only is to make a 3D model of the wreck site and take photos. ""The autonomous vehicle has a number of different sensors, ranging in resolution from about 10m down to about half a metre. And it also has cameras. It's not going to be as crisp as the image you or I might take - but almost as good as that,"" expedition chief scientist Prof Julian Dowdeswell told BBC News. The search will be challenging because of the sea-ice at the surface. The Agulhas will have to periodically shift its hull to maintain open holes in the floes, through which to launch and recover AUVs. Prof Dowdeswell emphasised: ""The robot has to be recovered by the parent vessel [before the data can be] interrogated. And the difficulty with this is that in severe sea-ice conditions - it's not that easy to recover the autonomous underwater vehicle. That is an act of seamanship in itself - before the data can be looked at."" Frank Worsley used his sextant to record the position of the sinking Scientists are extremely confident they are in the right place to find Endurance. Shackleton's skipper, Frank Worsely, was a very skilled navigator and used a sextant and chronometer to calculate the precise co-ordinates of the Endurance sinking - 68Â°39'30.0"" South and 52Â°26'30.0"" West. The ship is almost certainly within a few nautical miles of this point - and there is every chance it is in reasonable condition. Allow Twitter content?

The organisms that normally consume sunken wooden vessels do not thrive in the cold waters of the Antarctic, so even though the Endurance was broken when it went down, its timbers are most probably well preserved on the ocean floor. ""The ship is always referred to as having been crushed by the ice; in fact, the timbers were breached by the ice. But there is no reason to assume the hull won't be for the most part integral, even though there should be a splay of debris, including masts and spars, around the vessel on the seafloor,"" Prof Dowdeswell, director of the Scott Polar Research Institute, added. The Agulhas made good progress to the search site last week after picking up supplies Just getting to the search site is a remarkable effort. The Agulhas has had to fight its way through ice that has thickened over several years. Unlike Shackleton, however, the Weddell Sea Expedition team has been assisted by satellite ice charts, which make picking a way through the floes a lot easier.

Mike Ashley cancels Patisserie Valerie bidThe retail tycoon made a Â£15m bid on Friday but administrators say the cafe chain is worth more.Business,"Mike Ashley's Sports Direct has cancelled a bid for collapsed cafe chain Patisserie Valerie, just two days after making an offer. The retail billionaireannounced his bid for the chainon Friday evening. Sports Direct offered Â£15m, but was told by administrator KPMG it would need to offer up to Â£2m more than this,according to the Financial Times.,external Patisserie Valerie collapsed last month. KPMG closed 70 outlets, but kept 121 open in the hope of selling them. Mr Ashley is thought to be facing several competing bids for Patisserie Valerie, including, according to reports, from Costa, the coffee chain bought by Coca-Cola last year. The retail tycoon, who also owns English Premier League football club Newcastle United, made his name building budget chain Sports Direct into Britain's biggest sporting goods retailer. Mike Ashley bids for Patisserie Valerie Mike Ashley: The saviour of the High Street? What is Mike Ashley's plan for the High Street? He has since become known for buying up struggling retail chains and bought both department store chain House of Fraser and cycle shop Evans out of administration last year. Sports Direct's sprawling High Street empire also includes lingerie chain Agent Provocateur as well as shareholdings in Debenhams, French Connection and Game Digital. Last week, it emerged as front runner to buy Sofa.com. Patisserie Valerie collapsed after an accounting scandal which left the firm without enough money to pay its debts. Rescue talks with banks HSBC and Barclays to restructure the business broke down, leaving no option but administration. The cafe chain employed about 3,000 staff, but some 900 jobs were lost in the initial wave of closures after KPMG was appointed to run the business on 22 January. The first cafe was opened on Frith Street in London's Soho district in 1926 In 1987 the Scalzo family bought the Old Compton Street store and ran the business In 2006, Luke Johnson's Risk Capital Partners bought a majority stake when it had eight stores. Patisserie Valerie was floated on the AIM stock market, for smaller companies, in 2014 In addition to Patisserie Valerie, the company's other brands include Druckers Vienna Patisserie, Philpotts, Baker & Spice and Flour Power City. The Serious Fraud Office is carrying out a criminal investigation into Patisserie Valerie and finance director Chris Marshwas arrested and released on bail after having been suspendedby the company. Also under investigation, by the Financial Reporting Council, are former Patisserie Valerie auditors Grant Thornton.

'Hitler paintings' fail to sell at auction,"The auction house had been hit with accusations they were selling fakes Five pictures said to have been painted by Nazi leader Adolf Hitler have failed to sell at auction in Germany. Weidler auction house hoped to raise â¬45,000 (Â£40,000; $51,000) from the most expensive work. The auction was held in Nuremberg, the German city once notorious for Hitler's mass rallies where leading Nazis were later tried for war crimes. Accusations of forgery marred the auction and city mayor Ulrich Maly described it as being in ""bad taste"". The sale also included items said to have been owned by the dictator, including a vase and a wicker chair with a swastika on its arm. Under Hitler's rule (1933-45), Nazi Germany began World War Two, pursuing a genocidal policy that resulted in the deaths of some six million Jews, and tens of millions of other civilians and combatants. Public displays of Nazi symbols are against the law in Germany - except in some contexts, such as for educational or historical reasons. The auction house got around the law by pixelating the symbols within their catalogue. Dozens of artworks, including some set for sale, were seized from the auction house last week by German police. Prosecutors said a total of 63 items bearing the signatures ""AH"" or ""A Hitler"" were confiscated over forgery concerns. An investigation was opened into unidentified individuals ""on suspicion of falsifying documents and attempted fraud"", Nuremberg-Fuerth chief prosecutor Antje Gabriels-Gorsolke told AFP. She confirmed the auction house had co-operated and handed the works over voluntarily. The five paintings that remained on sale failed to spark interest Sales of paintings purporting to be from the dictator regularly generate controversy and accusations of forgery. Last monthGerman police seized a collection due to go on sale in Berlinover concerns over their authenticity. Hitler, who was twice rejected by the Vienna Academy of Fine Arts, is known to have sold his artwork in his youth. Dozens of works attributed to him, which were regarded by art experts as being of poor quality, have been sold over the years. Facebook urged to block Nazi relic sales Row over 'tasteless' Nazi auction In 2015, Weidler auction house sold more than a dozen paintings attributed to Hitler for almost â¬400,000. A Swastika wicker chair said to have belonged to Hitler also failed to sell at the auction Bidders then reportedly came from Germany, China, France, Brazil and the United Arab Emirates. In 2014the auction house sold a Hitler watercolour of Munich's city hallfor â¬130,000. The sale of Nazi memorabilia remains a divisive topic around the world. Some buyers say it is for historical reasons, but campaign groups warn items are also purchased by far-right group members who idealise the regime. Last year, some UK-based groups lobbied online retailers to better regulate Nazi memorabilia sales.

China musician video 'shows he's not dead',"A screenshot of the footage appearing to show Mr Heyit Chinese state media have released a video appearing to show a Uighur musician previously reported to have died in a detention camp. The video, dated 10 February, features a man said to be Abdurehim Heyit stating that he is in ""good health"". Turkey earlier called on China to close the camps following reports of his death. Up to a million Uighurs are reportedly being detained. Some Uighurs have questioned the video's authenticity. Nury Turkel, chairman of the US-based Uyghur Human Rights Project, told the BBC that some aspects of the video were ""suspicious"". The Uighurs are a Muslim Turkic-speaking minority based in the north-western Xinjiang region of China, which has come under intense surveillance by Chinese authorities. Their language is close to Turkish and a significant number of Uighurs have fled to Turkey from China in recent years. The video was released by China Radio International's Turkish-language service, which said Turkey's criticism of China was unfounded. Allow Twitter content?

In it, Mr Heyit appears to say he is ""in the process of being investigated for allegedly violating national laws"". China has called on Turkey to retract its ""false accusations"". ""We hope the relevant Turkish persons can distinguish between right and wrong and correct their mistakes,"" foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told reporters. Its foreign ministry had said that detained Uighurs were being subjected to ""torture"" in ""concentration camps"". Foreign ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy said thereports of Mr Heyit's death ""further strengthened the Turkish public's reaction to the serious human rights violations in Xinjiang"",external. ""The reintroduction of concentration camps in the 21st Century and the systematic assimilation policy of Chinese authorities against the Uighur Turks is a great embarrassment for humanity,"" Mr Aksoy said. He called on UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres ""to take effective steps to end the human tragedy"" there. China has described the comments as ""completely unacceptable"". By John Sudworth, BBC News, Beijing Critics have long seen Turkey's silence over the plight of China's Uighurs as a strategic blunder, undermining President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's lofty claim to moral leadership of the Muslim world. But belatedly basing its condemnation of China's system of internment camps on a wrongful claim of a death in custody might be seen as an even bigger blunder. That is certainly the view of China's foreign ministry. ""The video clip has provided very good evidence for the truth,"" the ministry's spokeswoman said. In reality it's impossible to verify anything about the status of Abdurahim Heyit. Before the claims of the musician's death, and China's quick rebuttal, there had been no official word about his detention at all. Like hundreds of thousands of Uighurs, he had simply disappeared into a legal black hole. And the video bears all the hallmarks of the forced, televised confessions regularly produced by the combined efforts of China's Communist Party controlled courts, police investigators and state-run media. China has been quick to claim that the reports of Mr Heyit's death prove that much of the criticism of the situation in Xinjiang is based on falsehoods. But critics will continue to argue that the confusion - stemming from the lack of any independent scrutiny - shows precisely why there's such growing concern, even, finally, in Turkey. The long read: China's hidden camps Explainer: China's Muslim 'crackdown' Xinjiang legalises 're-education' camps So far few Muslim-majority countries have joined in public international condemnation of the allegations. Analysts say many fear political and economic retaliation from China. However Mr Turkel said the release of the video showed that the Chinese government did respond to public pressure. ""The Chinese government responds to Turkey because of the influence it has in the Muslim world,"" he said, adding that UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres had been ""awfully quiet"" on the issue of detentions in Xinjiang. ""The ball is in the Chinese government's court. They detained Heyit. They detained 10% of the Uighur population. They are trying to tell the world there is no abuse and these are just so-called vocational training centres. It's their responsibility to prove the video is authentic,"" he said. Mr Turkel said the Chinese government was capable of doctoring video because of the ""technological advantages it has"". BBC newsreader 'speaks' languages he can't Deepfakes: The face-swapping software explained ""With today's technology it is possible to create a video presentation. It's not that difficult,"" he said. Amnesty International has said it is very concerned about reports of his death. He was a celebrated player of the Dutar, a two-stringed instrument that is notoriously hard to master. At one time, he was venerated across China. He studied music in Beijing and later performed with national arts troupes. Mr Heyit's detention reportedly stemmed from a song he had performed titled Fathers. It takes its lyrics from a Uighur poem calling on younger generations to respect the sacrifices of those before them. But three words in the lyrics - ""martyrs of war"" - apparently led Chinese authorities to conclude that Mr Heyit presented a terrorist threat. The Uighurs make up about 45% of the population in Xinjiang. This video can not be played John Sudworth reports from Xinjiang, where one million Uighurs have reportedly been detained They see themselves as culturally and ethnically close to Central Asian nations. In recent decades, large numbers of Han Chinese (China's ethnic majority) have migrated to Xinjiang, and the Uighurs feel their culture and livelihoods are under threat. Xinjiang is officially designated as an autonomous region within China, like Tibet to its south.

"Footballer gives Â£27,000 to pilot search","Emiliano Sala (left) was on board a plane being flown by pilot David Ibbotson French football star Kylian Mbappe has donated Â£27,000 to a fundraising appeal set up by the family of missing pilot David Ibbotson. Mr Ibbotson, from Crowle, Lincolnshire, was flying Cardiff City's Emiliano Sala from Nantes to the UK when their plane crashed near Guernsey on 21 January. The footballer's body was recovered from the wreck on the seabed, but Mr Ibbotson's body has not been found. Former England captain Gary Lineker has also donated Â£1,000. By Sunday evening more than 7,000 donations had been received, pushing the total raised to more than Â£130,000 of the page's Â£300,000 target. World Cup winner and Paris St-Germain forward Mbappe, whose full name is Kylian Mbappe Lottin, donated under the name Elie Lottin. Lineker linked to the page from his Twitter feed, saying: ""Here's the Go Fund Me page should you wish to help this poor family"". Kylian Mbappe has given Â£27,000 to the search page for missing pilot David Ibbotson The light aircraft was en route from France to Cardiff when it crashed two days after the Argentine striker's Â£15m transfer to the Bluebirds was announced. An official search was called off on 24 January, but Sala's body was found after an appeal launched by his agent raised Â£324,000 (371,000 euros) for a private search. Who owned the plane Sala died in? Minute's silence observed at Cardiff game Saints fans caught making Sala taunts Launching their own appeal, Mr Ibbotson's family wrote: ""We are trying to come to terms with the tragedy and the loss of two incredible men. ""To be told the search has now been called off for the foreseeable future has only made this tragic time more difficult.

"Footballer gives ÃÂ£27,000 to pilot search","Emiliano Sala (left) was on board a plane being flown by pilot David Ibbotson French football star Kylian Mbappe has donated Â£27,000 to a fundraising appeal set up by the family of missing pilot David Ibbotson. Mr Ibbotson, from Crowle, Lincolnshire, was flying Cardiff City's Emiliano Sala from Nantes to the UK when their plane crashed near Guernsey on 21 January. The footballer's body was recovered from the wreck on the seabed, but Mr Ibbotson's body has not been found. Former England captain Gary Lineker has also donated Â£1,000. By Sunday evening more than 7,000 donations had been received, pushing the total raised to more than Â£130,000 of the page's Â£300,000 target. World Cup winner and Paris St-Germain forward Mbappe, whose full name is Kylian Mbappe Lottin, donated under the name Elie Lottin. Lineker linked to the page from his Twitter feed, saying: ""Here's the Go Fund Me page should you wish to help this poor family"". Kylian Mbappe has given Â£27,000 to the search page for missing pilot David Ibbotson The light aircraft was en route from France to Cardiff when it crashed two days after the Argentine striker's Â£15m transfer to the Bluebirds was announced. An official search was called off on 24 January, but Sala's body was found after an appeal launched by his agent raised Â£324,000 (371,000 euros) for a private search. Who owned the plane Sala died in? Minute's silence observed at Cardiff game Saints fans caught making Sala taunts Launching their own appeal, Mr Ibbotson's family wrote: ""We are trying to come to terms with the tragedy and the loss of two incredible men. ""To be told the search has now been called off for the foreseeable future has only made this tragic time more difficult. ""We can not bear the thought of him being alone, we need him home so that we are able to lay him to rest.""

Thousands flee New Zealand wildfire,"This video can not be played New Zealand wildfire: Residents flee as fire spreads Thousands of people have been evacuated from a New Zealand town as firefighters battle a wildfire stoked by winds in the country's South Island. The blaze, which began six days ago near the city of Nelson, is now threatening the town of Wakefield. A state of emergency has been declared and about 3,000 people have fled their homes in the district of Tasman. Strong winds were expected, and officials warned that Sunday could be a ""critical danger point"" for the fire. Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said she hoped ""the weather plays ball"". The blaze is thought to be the worst forest fire in New Zealand since 1955. Nelson MP Nick Smith said the entire region was a ""tinderbox"" and its 70,000 residents were ""on edge."" Twenty-three helicopters and two planes have been deployed to tackle the blaze. Rain forecast for the area on Tuesday is expected to miss the fire zone. Fires of this size are unusual for New Zealand, with local media calling it the worst bushfire in 50 years. Huge ice chunks break off Tasman Glacier Will extreme weather of 2018 be repeated?

Tougher jail terms over pensions scandals,"Company bosses could face up to seven years in prison if they mismanage employee pension schemes, says Work and Pensions Secretary Amber Rudd. She wants a new offence of ""wilfully or recklessly"" mismanaging funds. Plans outlined last year for a maximum sentence of two years in prison were toughened up after public consultation. Ms Rudd told the Sunday Telegraph,externalthe law will target ""the reckless few"". But one ex-pensions minister says civil, not criminal, action may be better. Sir Steve Webb said it could be difficult and time consuming to reach the higher burden of proof needed in criminal cases. ""If you run your company pension into the ground, saddling it with massive, unsustainable debts, we're coming for you,"" Ms Rudd said. Landmark day for state pension equality Pension savers 'cash in, but lose out' Carillion pension scheme was 'ignored' Ex-BHS boss Chappell loses pensions appeal Ms Rudd said current rules mean that ""acts of astonishing arrogance"" by a few company directors are punished with fines ""that barely dent bosses' bank balances"". Under the proposed new law, which still requires Parliamentary approval, courts would also be given the power to levy unlimited fines for mismanagement of pensions. Nicola Parish, from The Pensions Regulator, said: ""We welcome the proposed new powers which, as a package, would allow us to identify potential problems earlier and take more effective action."" And Frank Field, chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, said: ""The Secretary of State deserves huge credit for stepping in to sort this so early in her tenure, where others have so long failed to act... most people would be aghast to hear that this law doesn't already exist."" But ex-pension minister Sir Steve Webb said civil action could be more effective. Sir Steve, the former Liberal Democrat pensions minister in the coalition government, said that the criminal offence was ""a good headline that risks achieving nothing or worse than nothing"". He said it was difficult and potentially time wasting trying to show, under criminal law with its higher burden of proof, that bosses deliberately underfunded a pension scheme. Sir Steve, now director of policy at Royal London insurance firm, added: ""This initiative was first floated before the last general election in 2017. ""Two years on, we have not even had the primary legislation.  We are years away from seeing this in force."" The failures of BHS, with a Â£500m deficit in its pension scheme, and the outsourcing group, Carillion, with an even bigger shortfall, prompted the government to conduct a review of pension law. A year after it was sold by Sir Philip Green for Â£1 in 2015, the retailer fell into administration, leaving a Â£571m pension deficit. Sir Philip agreed later to pay Â£363m towards it to end action against him by the Pensions Regulator.

Met police chief: 'I'm a bit different',"Metropolitan Police commissioner Cressida Dick believes being ""a bit different"" has encouraged others who ""feel different"" to join the force. Speaking to BBC Radio 4's Desert Island Discs, Ms Dick, Britain's most senior police officer, said being female and openly gay made unlikely recruits think they too could ""have a go"" at policing. But she said her sexuality was ""one of the least interesting things about me"". She also said female police officers should make up half the force. She said: ""The fact that I am seen as a bit different in some respects, I realise, on some occasions, makes young people think 'I could have a go' or 'I might try; I feel different but I might try'."" She said she hoped the that a lot of women are among the new recruits, to ensure a more balanced male/female divide. ""In the long term, in order for us to have the best of the best, I would like it to be 50/50,"" she told Lauren Laverne, who hosts the show. But she added that she did not think it would be achieved during her tenure. Cressida Dick appointed as first female Met Police chief Met police chief: New job 'beyond my wildest dreams' Ms Dick recalled how she became a police officer at the age of 23, after a spell working in a fish and chip shop with a man who kept a baseball bat behind the counter. In the early days, she patrolled London's West End, including the Soho area - traditional home of London's sex trade. ""I loved the idea that at three or four in the morning it was just me there. ""That is the great thing about policing, you do have a lot of responsibility very early and you have got to make decisions - sometimes life-and-death decisions -  very quickly. ""There is something about putting a uniform on and thinking 'people are looking to me to make decisions and to look after them' that makes you feel capable."" She described the mistaken killing ofBrazilian electrician Jean Charles de Menezes- which happened during a counter-terrorism operation that she commanded - as ""an awful time"". Mr de Menezes, 27, was shot in the head at London's Stockwell Tube in 2005 by police who mistook him for a terror suspect. ""I think about it quite often,"" said Ms Dick, who was ultimately absolved of any blame. ""I wish, wish, wish it hadn't happened, of course, but if anything it has made me a better leader, a better police officer and it has made me more resilient."" Ms Dick picked tracks including In Private by Dusty Springfield and the hymn Lord Of All Hopefulness among the tunes to take to the desert island with her, and her book choice was the complete works of Thomas Hardy. Her choice of luxury item was soap. ""Scent is very important to me, but it is the case that my colleagues think it is hilarious that I simply cannot smell, ever, the smell of cannabis,"" she joked.

Alleged hacker in legal bid over computers,"Lauri Love was first arrested in October 2013 An alleged hacker whose computers were seized by police more than five years ago is using legislation from 1897 to seek their return. The High Court blocked the extradition of Lauri Love, from Suffolk, to the United States last year. Mr Love, 34, is alleged to have stolen data from US agencies. He was arrested and items were seized by British police. Although he was charged in the US, he faces no charges in the UK. On Monday, Mr Love, who has British-Finnish nationality, is taking the National Crime Agency (NCA) to court. He is using thePolice (Property) Act of 1897,externalto seek the return of computer equipment that was seized by police in 2013. Lauri Love attended the appeal hearing with his girlfriend, Sylvia Mann The case is being heard at Hendon Magistrates' Court in London. In 2015, the NCA said it was refusing to hand back Mr Love's computers until he helped them decrypt some of the files. Mr Love, of Stradishall, said that, as the ""NCA has not elected to pursue charges and has seemingly not put any efforts into this end"", it is time they returned the property to him. He said he was concerned at the ""absurdly protracted"" length of time that he has had to wait for a resolution of the case. Mr Love, who was arrested in 2013 on suspicion of Computer Misuse Act offences, said it was important to ""resist"" moves that lead to the ""arbitrary deprivation of property and data"". Supporters of Lauri Love had gathered outside court while his hearing took place The NCA said the investigation continued and a spokeswoman added: ""A number of devices were seized by the NCA at the time, and these devices remain in the hands of the NCA."" Mr Love allegedly stole data from US agencies, including the Federal Reserve, the US Army, the defense department, Nasa and the FBI, in a spate of online attacks in 2012 and 2013.

Dating apps 'must not risk children's safety',"Dating apps Grindr and Tinder are to be asked to explain to the government how they protect children, after an investigation claimed minors are put at risk of sexual exploitation. More than 30 cases of child rape have been investigated by police since 2015 after victims evaded age checks on such apps,the Sunday Times found,external. Culture Secretary Jeremy Wright described it as ""truly shocking"". Grindr and Tinder both said they have measures to prevent minors using them. A Freedom of Information request by the Sunday Times also showed 60 further instances of child sex offences - including grooming, kidnapping and violent assault - through online dating services. The youngest victim was eight years old, the paper said. Mr Wright said the investigation produced ""yet more evidence that online tech firms must do more to protect children"". He said he plans to write to Tinder and Grindr to ask ""what measures they have in place to keep children safe from harm, including verifying their age."" ""If I'm not satisfied with their response, I reserve the right to take further action,"" he said. Legislation coming into effect from April, whichrequires porn sites to use age verification technology,may now be extended to dating apps, he said. Last week Instagram vowed toremove all self-harm imagesfrom the social media platform. The move comes after the father of 14-year-old Molly Russell, who took her own life in 2017, said Instagramhad ""helped kill"" his daughter. Molly's family found she had been viewing graphic images of self-harm on the site prior to her death. A spokeswoman for Tinder said the platform used automated and manual tools and ""spend millions of dollars annually"" to prevent and remove underage users and other inappropriate behaviour and they ""don't want minors on Tinder"". In a statement to the Sunday Times, Grindr said: ""Any account of sexual abuse or other illegal behaviour is troubling to us as well as a clear violation of our terms of service. ""Our team is constantly working to improve our digital and human screening tools to prevent and remove improper underage use of our app."" Earlier this week, aman was jailed for two-and-a-half years for sexual activity with a 12-year-old girlwho he said he thought was 19. Carl Hodgson, 28, invited the child, who he made contact with on a dating app, to his flat and sent images of her in a body stocking to a friend via WhatsApp. Manchester Crown Court was told Hodgson filmed the girl on his phone and also carried out a sex act while she looked on.

Zoo visitors 'petrified' by escaped chimp,"This video can not be played 'Don't escape you bad little gorilla' Families have described their shock at coming across a chimpanzee outside its enclosure at Belfast Zoo. Chantal Baxter said ""one of the big chimpanzees just appeared from behind a bush"" on Saturday afternoon. Danielle Monaghan said she was ""petrified"" the chimp might ""attack or take the kids"". But the mother of two said the animal was ""not aggressive"" and ""just watched"" and therefore the experience had been ""amazing"". Footage posted on social media shows a chimpanzee on a path with members of the public, while several other chimpanzees remained on the enclosure wall. Belfast Zoo said the chimpanzees made an improvised ladder from a large tree branch propped up against a wall. This is the second escape attempt by animals at the zoo in as many months. In January,a red panda called Amber went missing from the zoo overnightbefore being discovered in a nearby garden. Exotic beasts that roamed Belfast's streets Ms Monaghan, from Holywood, was at the zoo with her two children Grace, eight, Leo, six, her partner Dean McFaul and his four-year-old nieces Summer and Willow. They filmed the entire escape from start to finish, and Ms Monaghan said it was a day she would ""never forget"". This video can not be played One of the chimps ventured a bit further than the others She said they ""could not believe it"" when the ""smart"" chimpanzees started to climb out of the enclosure, and when they went to take a closer look, they ended up ""a foot"" away from one of them. ""I was petrified, obviously, having the kids and I tried not to show fear but inside I was a bit like what happens if it attacks us or tries to take the kids or runs over,"" she told BBC News NI. ""But we just had to stay calm. ""It may have been a different story if it had been aggressive but it absolutely wasn't. It made us feel at ease. We just walked past it and it was absolutely grand."" Ms Baxter, from Larne, said when the chimpanzee appeared before them, her youngest child shouted at it. ""I think she scared it and it did sort of make its way back up the hill,"" she said. One chimpanzee went for a bit of a wander... ""But there were four of them that we could see were out. There was one on the path and there were three of them sitting on the wall. ""We were a bit shocked, obviously, being approached by this big chimpanzee. The kids were shocked. ""I suppose now it's easy to think it was funny, but it was quite dangerous."" Belfast City Council, which runs the zoo, said one chimpanzee ""briefly"" left its enclosure. ""Zookeepers were present as the chimpanzee quickly returned from an adjacent wall to the rest of the group inside the enclosure,"" a spokeswoman said. ... while the others remained on the wall The zoo's Alyn Cairns said: ""We think what has happened is that the trees in their enclosure have been weakened by the storms and so they've been able to break them and use them as a ladder to get out. He said the zoo's chimps were ""quite cowardly"" so went back into their enclosure themselves during the incident. The zoo's Alan Cairns said the ""intelligent"" primates ""got back in themselves"" ""They're intelligent primates and know they're not supposed to be out of their enclosure, so got back in themselves,"" he said. ""We like things to be natural in their enclosure, to have trees in it, but we will review it. ""We may have to remove the trees or make them a smaller level, although we don't want to do that."" The chimpanzees were locked into their inner enclosure after the great escape. Chimpanzees are one of four types of ""great ape"" - the others being bonobos, gorillas, and orangutans Humans and chimpanzees share 95% to 98% of the same DNA Chimpanzees walk on all fours and have longer arms than legs Chimpanzees sometimes hunt and eat small mammals such as bushbuck or monkeys They also eat fruit, nuts, seeds, blossoms, leaves, and many kinds of insects A full-grown chimpanzee has five or six times the strength of a human being Source: Jane Goodall Institute UK Exotic beasts that roamed Belfast's streets New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'

Holocaust memorial 'will harm park',"An artist's impression shows how the memorial might look in its proposed location in Victoria Tower Gardens beside the Houses of Parliament A Holocaust memorial proposed for outside Parliament would have a ""significant harmful impact"" on the area, the Royal Parks have said. The landmark is planned to be built at Victoria Tower Gardens on Millbank, alongside the River Thames. Royal Parks, which looks after the space, said it could not support the plans as the Grade II listed park was a ""highly sensitive location"". The application is currently being considered by Westminster City Council. The proposed memorial features 23 large bronze fin structures and an underground learning centre. It will be dedicated to the six million Jewish men, women and children and other victims murdered by the Nazis. The project wasannounced in 2016 by then prime minister David Cameron, with the works being led by theUK Holocaust Memorial Foundation.,external The proposed plans feature 23 large bronze fin structures and an underground learning centre In a letter to the council, Royal Parks said while it ""strongly supports"" the principle of the project, it thought the current design would have ""significant harmful impacts"" on the ""character and function"" of the park. ""The structure will dominate the park and eclipse the existing listed memorials which are nationally important in their own right,"" the charity said. Royal Parks added the number of visitors expected would create ""queues and congestion"" and ""change the nature of what is currently a relaxed park"". It has been predicted that one million people would visit the memorial in its first year. Holocaust memorial design announced One in 20 denies Holocaust took place The right place for Holocaust memorial? Architect Sir David Adjaye, who has led the design team, previously said ""disrupting the pleasure of being in a park is key to the thinking"" of the memorial. However, he later added that architects were working to ensure that 90% of the original park was retained. This video can not be played Schoolchildren say a Holocaust memorial at Westminster could help MPs think about their decisions More than 10,000 people have signed an online petition calling on the government to reconsider the location. A spokeswoman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said ""no location in Britain is more suitable for the area for the memorial"".

"Shut detention camps, Turkey tells China","This video can not be played John Sudworth reports from Xinjiang, where one million Uighurs have reportedly been detained Turkey has called on China to close detention camps holding ethnic Uighurs following the reported death of a renowned musician from the minority. Abdurehim Heyit is thought to have been serving an eight-year sentence in the Xinjiang region, where up to a million Uighurs are reportedly being detained. A statement from Turkey's foreign ministry said they were being subjected to ""torture"" in ""concentration camps"". China described the comments as ""completely unacceptable"". The Uighurs are a Muslim Turkic-speaking minority based in the north-west Xinjiang region of China, which has come under intense surveillance by Chinese authorities. Their language is close to Turkish and a significant number of Uighurs have fled to Turkey from China in recent years. So far few Muslim-majority countries have joined in public international condemnation of the allegations. Analysts say many fear political and economic retaliation from China. In a statement issued on Saturday, foreign ministry spokesman Hami Aksoy said: ""It is no longer a secret that more than a million Uighur Turks exposed to arbitrary arrests are subjected to torture and political brainwashing"" in prisons, adding that those not detained were ""under great pressure"". ""The reintroduction of concentration camps in the 21st century and the systematic assimilation policy of Chinese authorities against the Uighur Turks is a great embarrassment for humanity,"" Mr Aksoy said. He also said the reports of Heyit's death ""further strengthened the Turkish public's reaction to the serious human rights violations in Xinjiang"" and called on UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres ""to take effective steps to end the human tragedy"" there. The long read: China's hidden camps Explainer: China's Muslim 'crackdown' Xinjiang legalises 're-education' camps Rights groups say Uighurs, Kazakhs and other Muslim minorities are being detained indefinitely without charge for infractions like refusing to give a DNA sample, speaking in a minority language, or arguing with officials. In a statement quoted by the Associated Press, China through its embassy in Ankara called on Turkey to withdraw its ""false accusations"". ""Both China and Turkey face the arduous task of fighting terrorism. We are opposed to maintaining double standards on the question of fighting terrorism,"" it said. ""We hope the Turkish side will have a correct understanding of the efforts made by China to legally deploy measures to effectively fight terrorism and extremism, withdraw its false accusations and take measures to eliminate their harmful effects."" Beijing claims that the detention camps in Xinjiang are ""vocational education centres"" designed to help rid the region of terrorism. Speaking last October, the top Chinese official in Xinjiang, Shohrat Zakir, said ""trainees"" in the camps were grateful for the opportunity to ""reflect on their mistakes"". Amnesty International said it was very concerned about reports of his death, which has not been officially confirmed. Heyit was a celebrated player of the Dutar, a two-stringed instrument that is notoriously hard to master. At one time, he was venerated across China. He studied music in Beijing and later performed with national arts troupes. Heyit's detention reportedly stemmed from a song he performed titled Fathers. It takes its lyrics from a Uighur poem calling on younger generations to respect the sacrifices of those before them. But three words in the lyrics - ""martyrs of war"" - apparently led Chinese authorities to conclude that Heyit presented a terrorist threat. The Uighurs make up about 45% of the population in Xinjiang. They see themselves as culturally and ethnically close to Central Asian nations. In recent decades, large numbers of Han Chinese (China's ethnic majority) have migrated to Xinjiang, and the Uighurs feel their culture and livelihoods are under threat. Xinjiang is officially designated as an autonomous region within China, like Tibet to its south.

What effect has Brexit had on UK economy?,"Economic growth has not been disastrous, but nor has it been sparkling There may still be more than a month to go until Brexit is scheduled to happen, but there has already been some fallout from the decision to leave. Most recently, the prolonged uncertainty - what the governor of the Bank of England refers to as the ""Brexit fog"" - appears to be leaving some potentially worrying scars on prosperity. What is clear, however, is that two-and-a-half years after the referendum, the most dire predictions about what could have happened to financial wellbeing have failed to transpire. Rewind to May 2016. The then chancellor, George Osborne, warned of what he said would happen over the immediate period of two years following a vote to leave the EU. He said: ""A vote to leave would represent an immediate and profound shock to our economy. That shock would push our economy into a recession and lead to an increase in unemployment of around 500,000, ""GDP would be 3.6% smaller, average real wages would be lower, inflation higher, sterling weaker, house prices would be hit and public borrowing would rise compared with a vote to remain."" He was assuming Article 50, the process by which the UK leaves, would be triggered immediately after the vote; in the event, it was nine months later. But the warning stands. Project Fear?  Well, the economy hasn't contracted, and the level of unemployment is actually the lowest on record. But that's not to say that the economy's path hasn't deviated from what had earlier been expected. Of course, there are other issues that will have influenced our economy's path - but the anticipation of the UK leaving the EU is far from insignificant. Let's start with prosperity. The economy has grown at an average of about 1.5% per year since the referendum - not sparkling, but not disastrous either. Average real wages are rising again. But most forecasters had hoped for more. The governor of the Bank of England said last May that households were Â£900 worse off compared with what it had expected pre-referendum. Since then, the gulf between those predictions and reality has widened, because of the prolonged uncertainty over the Brexit outcome. Retail spending slowed sharply towards the end of last year, while surveys suggest new orders have stagnated, such that activity in manufacturing has been driven largely by companies speeding up production to avert the risk of disruption after 29 March. The Bank of England found that business investment has slowed sharply, and reckons it will fall by even more this year. Companies are unwilling to flash the cash until they are confident about what lies ahead. That's not just down to a lack of clarity over Brexit, but a result, too, of weaker demand from elsewhere, as the likes of China and Europe slow down. As a result, the Bank now calculates the total level of GDP is about 1.2% lower than it had expected three years ago. Lower business investment tends to hamper how efficient we can be - that is productivity - and so could have a lingering impact on our economic health. And the reluctance to spend on buildings and equipment might help explain why employment is at a record high - one of the brightest spots in our economy. After the crisis, firms hung on to workers rather than invest in major projects, as it was the cheaper and more flexible option. They may be doing the same again. And while incomes in real terms, once the cost of living is accounted for, are on the rise, they remain lower on average than ahead of the financial crisis. Pay rises have been sluggish, but higher-than-expected inflation has also played a part, in particular in 2017. Prices that year rose by close to 3%, almost twice as much as expected pre-referendum. A higher cost of living means budgets don't stretch as far. That rise in inflation largely reflected a drop in the exchange rate in the aftermath of the referendum - which meant that sterling is worth about 10% less than it was previously. That led to a corresponding rise in the cost of many imports. A weaker pound may mean it's more expensive for UK holidaymakers to venture abroad - but on the upside, it makes the UK a more attractive destination.  A record 39.2 million overseas visitors came to the UK in 2017, spending Â£24.5bn. In theory, too, a weaker pound makes UK exports more attractive.  Sales to overseas customers were stronger than anticipated pre-referendum - but they rose by less than would have been expected. And surveys over the last couple of months have suggested export orders have dried up, perhaps as customers fear a no-deal scenario could spell delay and extra charges on delivery. What happens when the ""Brexit fog"" lifts? The government has hinted at hopes of a ""deal dividend"" - businesses and consumers going ahead with the spending that they may have been holding back. It'll take a while to fathom if that has happened - and then it'll be time to start looking at the impact of Brexit itself.

What are the no-deal preparations?,"Police, the government, the Border Force and ferry companies are among those preparing for a no-deal Brexit It could become the UK's biggest peacetime emergency in almost a century. Unless a withdrawal agreement is approved (or Article 50 is delayed), at 23:00 GMT on 29 March the UK will leave the European Union with no negotiated exit - and in a second everything will change. Suddenly, British goods going to the EU will be subject to duty (a payment, for example on imports and exports), and will need to be checked for compliance with things like sanitary regulations. Goods arriving in the UK from the EU could face checks too, though the government has said it will not do that straight away, partly because it doesn't have the infrastructure. Brexit: A really simple guide What is it all about? Brexit explained in videos The jargon explained The rules around things like fishing rights, air traffic and nuclear regulation will all change in the blink of an eye too. The effect is likely to be a severe slowdown on the critical Dover-Calais ferry and Channel Tunnel routes, as well as unpredictable delays at airports. An army of civil servants has been working on the problem since the EU referendum. At the time of writing, about 4,000 have been moved into positions where they are preparing for the no deal scenario. As we get closer, another 5,000 will be transferred across to help. On the night of Brexit, the government is expected to declare a ""critical incident"" and to start operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week in a ""command and control"" mode. The Cobra emergency committee will meet at the Cabinet Office as ministers sit down to tackle the unpredictable effects of leaving the EU without a deal. The Ministry of Defence has promised to make 3,500 service personnel available to help. About 10% of these will be reservists. An order laid before Parliament under the Reserve Forces Act says they can be called upon from 10 February. There are 14 military planners already working in other Whitehall departments. But despite all that, the chief executive of the civil service, John Manzoni, still concedes that a no-deal Brexit could be a ""bit bumpy"". The biggest concern is that lorry traffic across the English Channel through Dover and the Channel Tunnel terminal near Folkestone will grind to a standstill. To manage that, Highways England, Kent County Council and Kent Police have come up with Operation Brock - a plan for parking up to 13,000 trucks who could be left waiting to get through. The first 2,000 will park on the southbound carriageway of the M20 between junctions eight and nine, 6,000 more will be moved to Manston Airport, and if that's not enough then the M26 will be used to hold another 5,000. This video can not be played Up to 90 lorries assembled at Manston airfield as part of a no-deal Brexit exercise The government has given Kent County Council Â£28.8m to improve Manston, to strengthen the roads around it (such as the A249, A256 and the A299), and for new signs and traffic signals, This way it is hoped that the county of Kent will not itself stop functioning, as happened during a strike at Calais in 2015. The government expects there will be ""significantly reduced access across the short straits"" for up to six months. The government has also announced temporary measuresallowing lorries arriving in the UK to drive straight off ferries and Channel Tunnel trains without making customs declarations in the event of no-deal. The guidance for importers and hauliers says companies would be able to file a simplified form online in advance and pay duty later. Brexit: Could Channel Ports cope with no deal? Could leaving with no deal cause traffic jams? Simplified customs plan for ports If Dover and Folkestone suddenly become slow and unpredictable ways of getting goods - some of them critical, like medical supplies - in and out, the government is hoping other routes will take more of the traffic. Saying ""a situation of extreme urgency exists"", the Department for Transportis paying a total of Â£107.7m to three ferry companiesto run extra ships. Ramsgate harbour needs to be dredged to clear access for larger ships Brittany Ferries will increase sailings for six weeks on the Portsmouth-Le Havre, Poole-Cherbourg and Plymouth-Roscoff routes. DFDS will increase the number of crossings on some of its routes. A new company -Seaborne Freight- had been asked by the government to run ships between Ramsgate and Ostend, butthe contract was later scrapped.The government said it had become clear that Seaborne was not going to be able to fulfil its side of the contract, and it is looking for another company to run additional freight ferries. Port companies such as Associated British Ports (ABP) have been improving the infrastructure at ports away from Dover in anticipation of increased traffic. The Department of Health (DoH) has developed extensive contingency plans, and has started to stockpile six weeks' worth of prescription-only and pharmacy medicines. It has signed Â£1m of contracts for refrigerated storage for approximately 5,000 pallets of medicine and another Â£9m for what is called ""ambient storage"", that is storage at room temperature. It has also been agreed in Whitehall that medicines and medical products would be given priority on freight routes, though it's not clear how that would work. The DoH has also made plans to air freight items like medical radioactive isotopes (used in radiotherapy and diagnostic tests) that have a very short shelf-life. Is NHS finding it hard to get medicines? Public may have to stockpile drugs in no-deal Brexit And it has recognised that some devices with short lead times - like stents and implants that come in many different shapes and sizes - cannot be easily stockpiled. So, the department is setting up a logistics hub in Belgium to help out companies who may face disruption. Suppliers are being asked to try to make their own arrangements - and to buy tickets for the extra ferry capacity that the government has secured. But if these efforts fail, they will be able to use what is being called the ""Dedicated Shipping Channel,"" which would aim to get the devices from the hub into the UK within three days. The same problem arises when it comes to food. Food manufacturers have been stockpiling ingredients, but there is starting to be a shortage of warehouse space - both ambient and chilled. Reality Check: What would 'no deal' Brexit mean for food and medicine? My Brexit box: The people stockpiling food Not many people predict a severe food crisis (the UK is about 60% self-sufficient on food), but it is likely that some fresh foods that come in on short timetables from the European Union will become scarcer. Once again, the effects are likely to be unpredictable. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is recruiting for an EU Exit Emergencies Centre (EUXE) which will run 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to manage ""any situations that arise if the UK leaves the European Union without a deal"". There are concerns too about what to do with excess fresh food and live animals produced in the UK if it cannot be exported in time. There have been concerns that some people - angry at a no-deal exit from the EU, or at the effects of that - will protest. In a briefing to staff, the National Crime Agency wrote: ""A no-deal exit is likely to result in significant short-term disruption across the country, which may manifest simultaneously across multiple areas and geographic locations."" Protesters outside Parliament in January when MPs voted on the government's Brexit deal The NCA said ""wider potential impacts such as transport blockages, fuel and food shortages and protests/public disorder, could impact on officers both personally and professionally"". Some police forces have stopped officers taking leave for the first weeks after Brexit, though senior officers think the risk of disorder is low. One of the effects of leaving the EU without a deal will be that British police officers will lose access to EU criminal justice tools such as the European Arrest Warrant (EAW), the European Criminal Records Information System (ECRIS), the Second Generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) and the European Investigation Order (EIO). To handle the loss of these modern tools, the NCA - which communicates with overseas forces and Europol - has recruited 87 officers to use the much less effective Interpol system and to use other arrangements that are less automated and more labour-intensive. An International Crime Co-ordination Centre is being set up by the National Police Chiefs Council as part of what is being called Operation Safety Net to help forces with things like international manhunts and missing people inquiries. To prepare for changes in immigration and customs at all points of entry into the UK, a Border Delivery Group has been established, chaired by Karen Wheeler, a senior official at HMRC. The government has admitted that the UK's borders are likely to operate in a ""sub-optimal"" way if there is a no-deal Brexit. The Border Force has recruited about 300 officers to make up a ""Readiness Task Force"" to provide ""operational resilience"" and allow other staff to do EU-related training. It is also recruiting a further 600 officers to make sure there are enough staff at the borders. In the event of no-deal, the UK will need to patrol its fishing waters much more extensively than it has for many years. The Royal Navy has already reprieved three Fishery Protection Patrol ships that were due to be taken out of service. It is preparing to provide 600 days a year of fishery protection, three times what it currently provides. The Marine Management Organisation (MMO), which regulates the seas around Britain, is also to pay up to Â£40m to charter civilian ships to help them patrol fisheries over the next four years The proposed contract - for up to four years - is due to start on 1 April. Brexit and fish: Skippers, kippers and the creel thing Will the UK and EU reach a Brexit fishing deal? It is to provide ships to help the MMO's Marine Enforcement Officers with a means of getting around the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in the seas around the UK. The contract says the ships must have a way of boarding other vessels. 12 key Brexit words you need to know Brexit: A really simple guide What happens now that a deal's been done?

Women 'victims in 63% of romance scams',"Victims of romance scams - the majority of whom are women - lost an average of Â£11,145 each last year, according to new figures. The data, from police reporting centre Action Fraud, showed that Â£50m was lost in these scams in 2018 when fraudsters pretend to be romantically attached. Fraudsters trick victims into sending money or gather enough personal information to steal their identities. These scams of the heart are being highlighted ahead of Valentine's Day. Police say that victims are targeted via online dating websites, apps, or through social media. Fraudsters use fake profiles to form a relationship with them. How I set out to catch a romance scammer In 2018, 4,555 reports of romance fraud were made to Action Fraud. Total losses were up by 27% compared with the previous year. The total is likely to be higher as many victims are thought to have suffered in secret. The average age of a romance fraud victim is 50 and 63% of victims are women. They lose twice as much on average as males, Action Fraud said. Commander Karen Baxter, head of the City of London Police's economic crime department, said: ""As cases of romance fraud increase each year, so too does the cost to victims, both emotionally and financially. ""The emotional damage of falling victim to romance fraud can often be far more difficult to come to terms with."" Dating site users are being urged not to take everything at face value. Many people who have been caught out have judged those they met online based on their social media profile, their job, or simply trusting them too soon. Criminals who commit romance fraud trawl through profiles and piece together information such as wealth and lifestyle, in order to manipulate their victims Police can investigate and help to provide support, but often cannot get the money back It is very simple for fraudsters to cover their tracks by masking IP addresses and using unregistered phone numbers Never send money to someone online you have never met Think twice about posting personal information which could be used to manipulate or bribe you Source: Action Fraud,external How I set out to catch a romance scammer Online dater, 86, conned by woman 'I lost Â£26k in web dating scam' Audio, 00:01:36'I lost Â£26k in web dating scam' New wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Watch: Fires reach Hollywood with fears iconic sign could be at risk 'Mum waited 31 hours' : Your stories of A&E this winter 'Where do I go?'

May to ask MPs for more time on Brexit,"This video can not be played Housing and Communities Secretary James Brokenshire on securing ""seamless border"" in Ireland MPs will get another chance to vote on Brexit this month - even if Theresa May has not been able to negotiate a deal by then. Housing Secretary James Brokenshire admitted it might not be the final, decisive vote on the PM's deal that Labour and some Tories are demanding. The prime minister needs to get a deal approved by Parliament by 29 March to avoid a no-deal Brexit. Labour has accused her of ""cynically"" running down the clock. Instead of a ""meaningful"" vote on the prime minister's deal with the EU, MPs could be given another series of non-binding votes on possible Brexit alternatives by 27 February, with the final vote on whether to approve or reject the deal delayed until the following month. On Wednesday, Mrs May will ask MPs for more time to get legally-binding changes to the controversial Northern Irish backstop, which she believes will be enough to secure a majority in Parliament for her deal. Brexit: What could happen next? Brexit: A really simple guide But the following day, Labour will attempt to force the government to hold the final, ""meaningful vote"" on Mrs May's Brexit deal by 26 February. Mr Brokenshire refused to commit to this date in an interview with the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, saying there could be more votes on amendments to the proposed deal instead. ""If the meaningful vote has not happened, so in other words things have not concluded, then Parliament would have that further opportunity by no later than 27 February,"" said Mr Brokenshire. ""I think that gives that sense of timetable, clarity and purpose on what we are doing with the EU - taking that work forward and our determination to get a deal - but equally knowing that role that Parliament very firmly has."" May says she can get Brexit deal through What's behind Corbyn's Brexit letter to May? New ideas for the Brexit border backstop He also ruled out removing the Irish backstop from the government's deal with the EU, as some Conservative MPs are demanding. He said ministers were exploring a possible time-limit to the backstop, or a legal mechanism allowing the UK to exit the backstop without the agreement of the EU, but he insisted some kind of ""insurance policy"" was needed to keep the Irish border free-flowing. Please upgrade your browser But Labour's shadow Brexit secretary, Sir Keir Starmer, says he believes the prime minister is ""pretending to make progress"" on the Irish backstop issue. He says what she actually intends to do is return to Parliament after the 21/22 March European Council summit the week before Brexit and offer MPs a ""binary choice"" - her deal or no deal. ""We can't allow that to happen,"" Sir Keirtold The Sunday Times,external. ""There needs to be a day when Parliament says that's it, enough is enough."" Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said delaying the final vote on the Brexit deal was ""worse than irresponsible"" and he ""would not be surprised if [Theresa May] faces a massive rebellion by Conservative MPs"". Conservative MP Sarah Wollaston, who like Sir Vince has campaigned for another EU referendum, called for ministers who were ""serious"" about preventing a no-deal Brexit to resign and vote against the government. Fellow Conservative MP Heidi Allen also called for ministerial resignations, saying it was ""completely irresponsible"" for the government to keep delaying the final Brexit vote.

Labour is proposing its own Brexit plan, which would involve the UK staying in a customs union with the EU, which they say could get the backing of a majority of MPs. The government has not ruled out supporting this - and has promised a formal response to it and further talks with Labour - but they say it would prevent the UK from making its own trade deals after Brexit. Theresa May and her husband Philip arriving at a church service on Sunday There are fewer than 50 days until Brexit. The law is already in place which means the UK will leave the EU on 29 March 2019. Mrs May's Brexit deal - which she spent months negotiating and had agreed with the EU - covers the terms of the UK's divorce and the framework of future relations. But it was rejected by the UK Parliament and if it is not approved by Brexit day, the default position would be a no-deal Brexit. Last month, Parliament voted in favour of an amendment that supported most of the PM's deal but called forbackstop- which is a last-resort option to prevent a hard border in Ireland - to be replaced with ""alternative arrangements"". The prime minister is now in talks with Brussels to seek these changes to the backstop. A number of government ministers will also be meeting their counterparts across the continent this week, in order to underline Mrs May's determination to achieve a deal. What effect has Brexit had on the UK economy? No-deal Brexit ferry contract scrapped What preparations are being made for a no-deal? Critics of the backstop in Mrs May's current deal say they could tie the UK to EU rules indefinitely or mean Northern Ireland ends up under a different system to the rest of the UK. But the Irish government and the EU have repeatedly rejected calls for changes. Other options likely to be debated by MPs on Thursday include extendingArticle 50, the legal mechanism taking the UK out of the EU on 29 March, to allow more time to reach an agreement with Brussels.

"Pension savers 'cash in, but lose out'","Savers focused on cashing-in some of their pension pot are ""sleepwalking"" into poor financial decisions, experts have warned. The City regulator, the Financial Conduct Authority (FCA), has confirmed plans to make choices clearer to those approaching retirement. Savers can cash in their pension from the age of 55. The FCA wants savers to be sent ""wake up"" information packs from 50 and to be given clearer details on investing. Some people are concentrating on taking some of their pension in cash and then leaving the rest of their money in inappropriate, low-return investments. Generally, saving in cash is less lucrative in the long-term than some other forms of investment. Former pensions minister Steve Webb said that these people were losing out owing to ""reckless caution"". The FCA said its proposals could benefit people by up to Â£25m a year. Changes to the rules governing pension access were introduced in April 2015 by the chancellor at the time, George Osborne. Previously, people would have bought an annuity - a financial product that provides a guaranteed retirement income - with their pension pot, although this is an option that remains open to them. How to get a pension of Â£20,000 by the time you retire Annuity or drawdown? Now, savers can choose from a range of options, including taking the whole amount out as a lump sum, paying no tax on the first 25%. Recent figures from HM Revenue and Customs (HMRC) revealed that Â£23 billion-worth of savings have been accessed so far. Some choose a so-called drawdown pension, which allows them to withdraw as much money as they like at any one time while the rest remains invested in a pension. The FCA said an estimated 100,000 customers entered drawdown without taking any kind of financial advice each year. It is now proposing that firms offer customers who do not take financial advice a range of off-the-shelf products that broadly meet their aims, called ""investment pathways"". Other proposals include: Pension investments are not put into cash savings unless the customer actively chooses this option Pension providers send ""wake-up"" packs to their customers at the age of 50, from November this year. This would include a single-page summary in clear language Clearer information on the actual charges savers have paid on their pension pot over the year, expressed in pounds and pence Steve Webb, the pensions minister at the time of the reform, who now works for pensions and investments firm Royal London, said: ""These FCA rules are a sensible response to the risk of savers sleepwalking into seeing their hard-earned savings eroded by sitting in low-return cash investments. ""There is still a problem where people cash out the whole pot and transfer it into a cash ISA or current account."" Rob Yuille, head of retirement policy at the Association of British Insurers (ABI), which represents many pension providers, said: ""Increasing information about fees and charges is something the industry has been working on for some time and we support the FCA's proposals.""

What effect has Brexit had on the UK economy?,"Economic growth has not been disastrous, but nor has it been sparkling There may still be more than a month to go until Brexit is scheduled to happen, but there has already been some fallout from the decision to leave. Most recently, the prolonged uncertainty - what the governor of the Bank of England refers to as the ""Brexit fog"" - appears to be leaving some potentially worrying scars on prosperity. What is clear, however, is that two-and-a-half years after the referendum, the most dire predictions about what could have happened to financial wellbeing have failed to transpire. Rewind to May 2016. The then chancellor, George Osborne, warned of what he said would happen over the immediate period of two years following a vote to leave the EU. He said: ""A vote to leave would represent an immediate and profound shock to our economy. That shock would push our economy into a recession and lead to an increase in unemployment of around 500,000, ""GDP would be 3.6% smaller, average real wages would be lower, inflation higher, sterling weaker, house prices would be hit and public borrowing would rise compared with a vote to remain."" He was assuming Article 50, the process by which the UK leaves, would be triggered immediately after the vote; in the event, it was nine months later. But the warning stands. Project Fear?  Well, the economy hasn't contracted, and the level of unemployment is actually the lowest on record. But that's not to say that the economy's path hasn't deviated from what had earlier been expected. Of course, there are other issues that will have influenced our economy's path - but the anticipation of the UK leaving the EU is far from insignificant. Let's start with prosperity. The economy has grown at an average of about 1.5% per year since the referendum - not sparkling, but not disastrous either. Average real wages are rising again. But most forecasters had hoped for more. The governor of the Bank of England said last May that households were Â£900 worse off compared with what it had expected pre-referendum. Since then, the gulf between those predictions and reality has widened, because of the prolonged uncertainty over the Brexit outcome. Retail spending slowed sharply towards the end of last year, while surveys suggest new orders have stagnated, such that activity in manufacturing has been driven largely by companies speeding up production to avert the risk of disruption after 29 March. The Bank of England found that business investment has slowed sharply, and reckons it will fall by even more this year. Companies are unwilling to flash the cash until they are confident about what lies ahead. That's not just down to a lack of clarity over Brexit, but a result, too, of weaker demand from elsewhere, as the likes of China and Europe slow down. As a result, the Bank now calculates the total level of GDP is about 1.2% lower than it had expected three years ago. Lower business investment tends to hamper how efficient we can be - that is productivity - and so could have a lingering impact on our economic health. And the reluctance to spend on buildings and equipment might help explain why employment is at a record high - one of the brightest spots in our economy. After the crisis, firms hung on to workers rather than invest in major projects, as it was the cheaper and more flexible option. They may be doing the same again. And while incomes in real terms, once the cost of living is accounted for, are on the rise, they remain lower on average than ahead of the financial crisis. Pay rises have been sluggish, but higher-than-expected inflation has also played a part, in particular in 2017. Prices that year rose by close to 3%, almost twice as much as expected pre-referendum. A higher cost of living means budgets don't stretch as far. That rise in inflation largely reflected a drop in the exchange rate in the aftermath of the referendum - which meant that sterling is worth about 10% less than it was previously. That led to a corresponding rise in the cost of many imports. A weaker pound may mean it's more expensive for UK holidaymakers to venture abroad - but on the upside, it makes the UK a more attractive destination.  A record 39.2 million overseas visitors came to the UK in 2017, spending Â£24.5bn. In theory, too, a weaker pound makes UK exports more attractive.  Sales to overseas customers were stronger than anticipated pre-referendum - but they rose by less than would have been expected. And surveys over the last couple of months have suggested export orders have dried up, perhaps as customers fear a no-deal scenario could spell delay and extra charges on delivery. What happens when the ""Brexit fog"" lifts? The government has hinted at hopes of a ""deal dividend"" - businesses and consumers going ahead with the spending that they may have been holding back. It'll take a while to fathom if that has happened - and then it'll be time to start looking at the impact of Brexit itself.

Ex-BHS boss loses pensions appeal,"Dominic Chappell, the former owner of BHS, has had his appeal dismissed by a judge who said he gave ""entirely unbelievable"" evidence. Mr Chappell was convicted for failing to provide information to the Pensions Regulator (TPR) and ordered to pay Â£87,000 in January. Department store BHS collapsed with the loss of 11,000 jobs and a pension deficit of Â£571m. Mr Chappell bought BHS for just Â£1 from billionaire Sir Philip Green in 2015. The businessman, who gave his address as Clenston Manor, near Blandford, Dorset, was issued with two notices under the Pensions Act 2004, in March and April 2016, before being handed a warning notice in November that year. Alex Stein, prosecuting, told the appeal hearing at Hove Crown Court that the crux of the case was that Chappell ""failed to respond"" to the three statutory notices. Judge Christine Henson QC said the majority of his answers during the hearing were ""not credible"". ""We are sure Mr Chappell had access to information which would allow him to answer the majority of information required,""  she said. Mr Chappell claimed he had been locked out of the department store's offices, and that all his documentation regarding BHS had been on a single memory stick which had been seized by HM Revenue and Customs. He also said that he had delegated the TPR information requests to his solicitor. BHS went into administration in April 2016, just 13 months after it was bought by Mr Chappell from Sir Philip. TPR opened an investigation into the sale over concerns about two of the company's pension schemes representing 19,000 members of staff. The regulator accused Sir Philip of making the sale tododge responsibilityfor the pension schemes in the event the firm should go bust. Sir Philip later agreed a Â£363m cash settlement to partly cover the pension costs.

Regulator warned over Carillion,"The Pensions Regulator was twice asked for help in getting Carillion to pay more into its pension schemes in the years running up to its collapse. Letters published by Parliamentary committees show the construction firm's pension trustees wrote to the regulator in 2010 and 2013 to flag up problems. The regulator has been criticised for failing to take early action to protect pensioners. However, it said it did get Carillion to raise its pension payments in 2013. Carillion went into liquidation last month. The construction giant - which also provided services for schools, hospitals and prisons - had only Â£29m of cash left, but a pensions deficit of hundreds of millions of pounds. In 2010, trustees had written to the Pensions Regulator saying that while they had advised Carillion that it needed to pay a minimum of Â£35m a year to help clear the pensions deficit, the maximum offered by the firm was Â£25m. The trustees deemed this ""not acceptable"". The 2013 letter said trustees wanted contributions of Â£65m a year over 14 years, but the company had offered Â£33.4m over 15 years. The trustees said they had reached an ""impasse"" with the firm and wanted ""intervention"" from the regulator. Investor 'fled' as Carillion collapsed Ex-boss takes blame for Carillion failure Carillion collapse delays new Â£335m Liverpool hospital Carillion: Six charts that explain what happened The chair of the Work and Pensions Committee, Frank Field MP, said: ""These letters suggest the Carillion directors were contemptuous of their pensions obligations. ""Their private pleading that the company could not afford more was in stark contrast to the rosy picture - and bumper dividends - being presented to the outside world. He added: ""With characteristic alacrity, the Pensions Regulator started its arduous process of chasing money down from Carillion a few days after it was formally announced there was no money left. I can only assume - and hope - they are going after some of those very generous bonuses."" In response, the Pensions Regulator said: ""When the trustees wrote to us in 2013 to say they could not agree funding plans with the company, we did intervene by threatening to use our powers unless a funding plan was agreed. ""Our intervention resulted in a significant increase in the amount of money the company was prepared to pay into the scheme. We believed this was reasonable, based upon our understanding of the company's trading strength as set out in its audited accounts. ""The investigation we have now launched is looking at whether there are grounds to use our anti-avoidance powers."" On Monday, the Official Receiver - the body in charge of liquidating Carillion - said a further 152  workers would be made redundant this week, taking the total number of jobs lost to 1,141. The failure has also led to job cuts and widespread disruption among sub-contractors.

What preparations are being made for a no-deal?,"Police, the government, the Border Force and ferry companies are among those preparing for a no-deal Brexit It could become the UK's biggest peacetime emergency in almost a century. Unless a withdrawal agreement is approved (or Article 50 is delayed), at 23:00 GMT on 29 March the UK will leave the European Union with no negotiated exit - and in a second everything will change. Suddenly, British goods going to the EU will be subject to duty (a payment, for example on imports and exports), and will need to be checked for compliance with things like sanitary regulations. Goods arriving in the UK from the EU could face checks too, though the government has said it will not do that straight away, partly because it doesn't have the infrastructure. Brexit: A really simple guide What is it all about? Brexit explained in videos The jargon explained The rules around things like fishing rights, air traffic and nuclear regulation will all change in the blink of an eye too. The effect is likely to be a severe slowdown on the critical Dover-Calais ferry and Channel Tunnel routes, as well as unpredictable delays at airports. An army of civil servants has been working on the problem since the EU referendum. At the time of writing, about 4,000 have been moved into positions where they are preparing for the no deal scenario. As we get closer, another 5,000 will be transferred across to help. On the night of Brexit, the government is expected to declare a ""critical incident"" and to start operating 24 hours a day, seven days a week in a ""command and control"" mode. The Cobra emergency committee will meet at the Cabinet Office as ministers sit down to tackle the unpredictable effects of leaving the EU without a deal. The Ministry of Defence has promised to make 3,500 service personnel available to help. About 10% of these will be reservists. An order laid before Parliament under the Reserve Forces Act says they can be called upon from 10 February. There are 14 military planners already working in other Whitehall departments. But despite all that, the chief executive of the civil service, John Manzoni, still concedes that a no-deal Brexit could be a ""bit bumpy"". The biggest concern is that lorry traffic across the English Channel through Dover and the Channel Tunnel terminal near Folkestone will grind to a standstill. To manage that, Highways England, Kent County Council and Kent Police have come up with Operation Brock - a plan for parking up to 13,000 trucks who could be left waiting to get through. The first 2,000 will park on the southbound carriageway of the M20 between junctions eight and nine, 6,000 more will be moved to Manston Airport, and if that's not enough then the M26 will be used to hold another 5,000. This video can not be played Up to 90 lorries assembled at Manston airfield as part of a no-deal Brexit exercise The government has given Kent County Council Â£28.8m to improve Manston, to strengthen the roads around it (such as the A249, A256 and the A299), and for new signs and traffic signals, This way it is hoped that the county of Kent will not itself stop functioning, as happened during a strike at Calais in 2015. The government expects there will be ""significantly reduced access across the short straits"" for up to six months. The government has also announced temporary measuresallowing lorries arriving in the UK to drive straight off ferries and Channel Tunnel trains without making customs declarations in the event of no-deal. The guidance for importers and hauliers says companies would be able to file a simplified form online in advance and pay duty later. Brexit: Could Channel Ports cope with no deal? Could leaving with no deal cause traffic jams? Simplified customs plan for ports If Dover and Folkestone suddenly become slow and unpredictable ways of getting goods - some of them critical, like medical supplies - in and out, the government is hoping other routes will take more of the traffic. Saying ""a situation of extreme urgency exists"", the Department for Transportis paying a total of Â£107.7m to three ferry companiesto run extra ships. Ramsgate harbour needs to be dredged to clear access for larger ships Brittany Ferries will increase sailings for six weeks on the Portsmouth-Le Havre, Poole-Cherbourg and Plymouth-Roscoff routes. DFDS will increase the number of crossings on some of its routes. A new company -Seaborne Freight- had been asked by the government to run ships between Ramsgate and Ostend, butthe contract was later scrapped.The government said it had become clear that Seaborne was not going to be able to fulfil its side of the contract, and it is looking for another company to run additional freight ferries. Port companies such as Associated British Ports (ABP) have been improving the infrastructure at ports away from Dover in anticipation of increased traffic. The Department of Health (DoH) has developed extensive contingency plans, and has started to stockpile six weeks' worth of prescription-only and pharmacy medicines. It has signed Â£1m of contracts for refrigerated storage for approximately 5,000 pallets of medicine and another Â£9m for what is called ""ambient storage"", that is storage at room temperature. It has also been agreed in Whitehall that medicines and medical products would be given priority on freight routes, though it's not clear how that would work. The DoH has also made plans to air freight items like medical radioactive isotopes (used in radiotherapy and diagnostic tests) that have a very short shelf-life. Is NHS finding it hard to get medicines? Public may have to stockpile drugs in no-deal Brexit And it has recognised that some devices with short lead times - like stents and implants that come in many different shapes and sizes - cannot be easily stockpiled. So, the department is setting up a logistics hub in Belgium to help out companies who may face disruption. Suppliers are being asked to try to make their own arrangements - and to buy tickets for the extra ferry capacity that the government has secured. But if these efforts fail, they will be able to use what is being called the ""Dedicated Shipping Channel,"" which would aim to get the devices from the hub into the UK within three days. The same problem arises when it comes to food. Food manufacturers have been stockpiling ingredients, but there is starting to be a shortage of warehouse space - both ambient and chilled. Reality Check: What would 'no deal' Brexit mean for food and medicine? My Brexit box: The people stockpiling food Not many people predict a severe food crisis (the UK is about 60% self-sufficient on food), but it is likely that some fresh foods that come in on short timetables from the European Union will become scarcer. Once again, the effects are likely to be unpredictable. The Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs is recruiting for an EU Exit Emergencies Centre (EUXE) which will run 24 hours a day, seven days a week, to manage ""any situations that arise if the UK leaves the European Union without a deal"". There are concerns too about what to do with excess fresh food and live animals produced in the UK if it cannot be exported in time. There have been concerns that some people - angry at a no-deal exit from the EU, or at the effects of that - will protest. In a briefing to staff, the National Crime Agency wrote: ""A no-deal exit is likely to result in significant short-term disruption across the country, which may manifest simultaneously across multiple areas and geographic locations."" Protesters outside Parliament in January when MPs voted on the government's Brexit deal The NCA said ""wider potential impacts such as transport blockages, fuel and food shortages and protests/public disorder, could impact on officers both personally and professionally"". Some police forces have stopped officers taking leave for the first weeks after Brexit, though senior officers think the risk of disorder is low. One of the effects of leaving the EU without a deal will be that British police officers will lose access to EU criminal justice tools such as the European Arrest Warrant (EAW), the European Criminal Records Information System (ECRIS), the Second Generation Schengen Information System (SIS II) and the European Investigation Order (EIO). To handle the loss of these modern tools, the NCA - which communicates with overseas forces and Europol - has recruited 87 officers to use the much less effective Interpol system and to use other arrangements that are less automated and more labour-intensive. An International Crime Co-ordination Centre is being set up by the National Police Chiefs Council as part of what is being called Operation Safety Net to help forces with things like international manhunts and missing people inquiries. To prepare for changes in immigration and customs at all points of entry into the UK, a Border Delivery Group has been established, chaired by Karen Wheeler, a senior official at HMRC. The government has admitted that the UK's borders are likely to operate in a ""sub-optimal"" way if there is a no-deal Brexit. The Border Force has recruited about 300 officers to make up a ""Readiness Task Force"" to provide ""operational resilience"" and allow other staff to do EU-related training. It is also recruiting a further 600 officers to make sure there are enough staff at the borders. In the event of no-deal, the UK will need to patrol its fishing waters much more extensively than it has for many years. The Royal Navy has already reprieved three Fishery Protection Patrol ships that were due to be taken out of service. It is preparing to provide 600 days a year of fishery protection, three times what it currently provides. The Marine Management Organisation (MMO), which regulates the seas around Britain, is also to pay up to Â£40m to charter civilian ships to help them patrol fisheries over the next four years The proposed contract - for up to four years - is due to start on 1 April. Brexit and fish: Skippers, kippers and the creel thing Will the UK and EU reach a Brexit fishing deal? It is to provide ships to help the MMO's Marine Enforcement Officers with a means of getting around the Exclusive Economic Zone (EEZ) in the seas around the UK. The contract says the ships must have a way of boarding other vessels. 12 key Brexit words you need to know Brexit: A really simple guide What happens now that a deal's been done?

Elizabeth Warren launches White House 2020 bid,"This video can not be played Elizabeth Warren: 'This is the fight of our lives... to build an America that works for everyone' US Senator Elizabeth Warren has formally launched her bid to stand for the White House in 2020 with a speech in which she promised to tackle economic inequality. She is the latest Democrat to launch a campaign to become the party's presidential candidate. Even before she had taken to the stage, President Donald Trump's 2020 campaign team had responded calling her a fraud. It is the first such intervention to target a possible Trump contender. ""The American people will reject her dishonest campaign and socialist ideas like the Green New Deal, that will raise taxes, kill jobs and crush America's middle-class,"" Mr Trump's campaign manager Brad Pascale wrote. He also accused her of ""impersonating and disrespecting"" Native Americans ""to advance her professional career,"" referring to a DNA test she took to prove her Cherokee ancestry. Mr Trump had long been calling her ""fake Pocahontas"". Ms Warren has apologisedfor taking the test. In her speech on Saturday in Lawrence, in her home state of Massachusetts, Ms Warren called Mr Trump ""the latest and most extreme symptom of what's gone wrong in America, a product of a rigged system that props up the rich and powerful and kicks dirt on everyone else"". Which Democrats are running in 2020? She added: ""This is the fight of our lives, the fight to build an America where dreams are possible, an America that works for everyone."" In the shadow of long-unused smoke stacks, at the site of a famous factory strike more than a century ago, Elizabeth Warren formally launched her presidential bid. She used the backdrop to highlight what she sees as the plight of an American working class that has been left behind by rapacious big business and indifferent government. Despite sub-zero temperatures and a blustery wind, an estimated crowd of several thousand turned out to hear the Massachusetts senator pledge to fight corruption in Washington, level the economic playing field and reform the US democratic process. Warren enters a crowded presidential field, as Democrats tell pollsters they want to find the candidate most able to beat Donald Trump. There were some in Ms Warren's campaign kick-off crowd who expressed concern that her struggles to explain her past claims of Native American heritage could make her vulnerable to attack. Ms Warren has long been a star in the progressive left, however, and she has already built a formidable nationwide campaign. She has just under a year to make her case, before voters start rendering their judgement.

Was Ruskin the most important man in 200 years?,"In the bicentenary of his birth, it’s time we looked again at the forward-thinking and influential ideas of the great Victorian, writes Daisy Dunn. If we think of John Ruskin at all today it tends to be as the buttoned-up Victorian who wasso repulsed by his wife Effie Gray’s pubic hair that he could not consummate their marriage. The anecdote, which was actually invented in the 20th Century, has overshadowed the fact that Ruskin was one of the most influential figures in modern history, inspiring everyone from Charlotte Brontë to Mahatma Gandhi and the founders of the UK’s National Trust. An artist, critic and social reformer, he was born in London 200 years ago this month, on 8 February 1819, the same year as Queen Victoria. And he was without question one of the most important Victorians of all. More like this: -Pierre Bonnard: The man who painted moods -Edward Burne-Jones: A painter of gender fluidity -Odd details hidden in masterpieces Ruskin was a man of intense contradictions. Like a fish, he said, it is healthiest to swim against the stream. He described himself mostly as a Conservative, but many of his ideas were socialist in outlook. He believed in hierarchy but also that the rich had a responsibility to protect the poor. He had a privileged background but gave away much of his wealth, reflecting in his autobiography that “it was probably much happier to live in a small house, and have Warwick Castle to be astonished at, than to live in Warwick Castle and have nothing to be astonished at”. His father did a lucrative trade in sherry. His mother was the pious daughter of a pub landlord from Croydon. She used to fret about him so incessantly that, when he went to study at Oxford in 1836, she insisted on accompanying him and having tea with him every day. Ruskin reflected that it was his father’s ambition that he “should enter at college into the best society, take all the prizes every year, and a double first to finish with; marry Lady Clara Vere de Vere; write poetry as good as Byron’s, only pious; preach sermons as good as Bossuet’s only Protestant, be made, at forty, Bishop of Winchester, and at fifty, Primate of England”. Although he never entered the Church, Ruskin did obtain a double first in Classics and Mathematics, and went on to achieve more than even his father had hoped. A new exhibition at Two Temple Placein London, England (later continuing in Sheffield) displays some of the objects from his life, including a softly-rendered portrait – possibly a self-portrait – of him as a handsome man with piercing blue eyes and characteristic blue cravat. By the time he graduated from university he had developed firm ideas about what made a good painting. While the critics of the day lambasted the ‘childish execution’ and haphazard paintwork of JMW Turner, Ruskin was full of admiration for the artist’s expressive seascapes, and drafted a riposte to the most damaging of the reviews. Had it not been for Ruskin it is questionable whether Turner’s art would be so popular today. The first volume of what became Ruskin’s five-book series on Modern Painters was written in 1843 as a defence of the artist, and attributed simply to ‘a Graduate of Oxford’. In it, Ruskin praised Turner as “the only perfect landscape painter whom the world has ever seen”. Although Ruskin feared that public opinion had been permanently tainted by the critics, his words found an appreciative public. As well as Charlotte Brontë, William Wordsworth and Alfred, Lord Tennyson were among the readers who praised them. Through his many books, Ruskin influenced the tastes of his generation, championing artists who were until then little known in England. While he was moved by Turner’s paintings, he was “utterly crushed to the earth” by the genius of the Venetian artist Tintoretto. Ruskin’s publications sparked fresh interest in Italian art and particularly Venetian Gothic architecture. He made numerous prints and drawings, fearing that, if he did not, Venice might vanish undocumented like “a lump of sugar in hot tea”. Indeed, Ruskin was not only an astute critic but a talented artist in his own right. He likened the “strong instinct” he felt to draw to the instinct to eat and drink. Drawings of gooseberry blossom and ragwort, mountains and clouds, minerals and birds, including an exquisite sulphur-crested cockatoo he sketched at the zoo, line the walls of the London exhibition. Art, he believed, should reflect nature. But what made Ruskin so unusual was that he was eager to pass his skills down not only to men like himself but to everyone. He was apparently as at ease teaching members of the Working Men’s College in London, where he was ‘wildly popular’, as he was the students of Oxford, where he was elected Slade Professor of Fine Art in 1869. Hundreds turned out to his lectures, which he would deliver with fascinating props, such as model feathers 10 times their actual size. ‘Ahead of his time’ And yet Ruskin is less famous for these achievements now than for his private life. In 1848 he married Effie Gray, the daughter of family friends from Perth, but the union was strained. Ruskin made little effort to indulge her interests – and was apparently helpless to ease the tensions between her and his domineering mother. Effie dissolved the marriage after six years on the grounds that it had not been consummated. In 1967 the writer Mary Lutyens proposed that Ruskin had been too shocked by the discovery that women had pubic hair to perform his marital duties. While it is true that Effie claimed that Ruskin “imagined women were quite different to what he saw I was”, and appeared “disgusted with my person”, and that Ruskin admitted that “there were certain circumstances in her person” that checked his passion, it remains unclear what those “circumstances” were. Effie went on to marry the artist John Everett Millais, whom Ruskin had championed along with fellow Pre-Raphaelite painters William Holman Hunt and Dante Gabriel Rossetti. “The poor man had a bad marriage, but it takes two to make a bad marriage,” says Clive Wilmer, master of the Guild of St George, which Ruskin founded in 1871. “He had faults, which one shouldn’t pretend weren’t there – he was very dogmatic… he could be quite arrogant – but he was extremely knowledgeable.” The Guild, which still exists today, was another of Ruskin’s great achievements, established in reaction against industrialisation and reliance on machines in Victorian Britain. “It was a very utopian idea,” says Simon Seligman, who manages the Guild’s communications. “It would establish a series of communities around the country, in which people would get back to nature, grow their own food, work with their hands… which of course are incredibly 21st-Century ideas.” Ruskin was certainly ahead of his time. As Leo Tolstoy said of him, “he thought and said not only what he himself had seen and felt, but what everyone will think and say in the future.” He recognised that progress came at the cost of human welfare and the environment and promoted the resurrection of crafts. The founders of garden cities and of the National Trust are often said to have been influenced by Ruskin’s ideals. To encourage workers out of the city and into the beauty of nature, he founded a museum on the fringes of Sheffield. “With this collection,” says Louise Pullen, curator of the Ruskin Collection for Museums Sheffield, where the objects from Ruskin’s museum are now kept, “the words which for me seem relevant – though Ruskin wouldn’t have used them – are ‘mindfulness’ and ‘wellbeing’. The idea was for workers to slow down, look at something closely, maybe draw it, go for a walk, make themselves happy again… Sadly, this didn’t work for Ruskin, but for many I think it could.” Ruskin was plagued by depressive episodes throughout his life and might have had bipolar disorder. His achievements are all the more astonishing considering that his mental health rendered him powerless for long periods. Yet some of his ideas have been criticised. In his staunch dismissal of machines, for instance, he displayed a peculiar single-mindedness. “Because he hated industrialisation,” says Simon Seligman, “he decided the railways are a disastrous thing – he’s even rude about bicycles! In a sense he misses the beauty of the contemporary around him.” But Ruskin’s uncompromising views were also what made him so influential. When he railed against the exploitation of poor labourers in Unto This Last, he offended some but inspired many. Mahatma Gandhi claimed that reading the book transformed him “overnight from a lawyer and city-dweller into a rustic”. Gandhi embraced Ruskin’s teaching that manual labour was just as important as the professions, and translated his work into Gujarati. Ruskin could never have done so much had he not had a considerable private income. When his father died in 1864, he inherited at least £120,000 from him and proceeded to pour much of it into philanthropic projects, buying up rows of houses to provide shelter for the poor. Although he lost money on some ventures, his kindness was such that, by the time he died from influenza at the age of 80 in 1900, he had given away much of his inheritance. In the bicentenary of his birth, the forethought and generosity of John Ruskin deserve to be recognised once again. As Wilmer, master of Ruskin’s Guild, says: “He was the most extraordinary man.” John Ruskin: The Power of Seeingis at Two Temple Place in London until 22 April.John Ruskin: Art & Wonderis at the Millennium Gallery in Sheffield from 29 May – 15 September.

IS resists 'final push' in eastern Syria,"Thousands of civilians have fled fighting in the last enclave held by IS militants US-backed fighters in Syria say they are meeting fierce resistance in the last enclave held by Islamic State (IS) militants near the Iraqi border. A battle has been going on for hours, with US-led coalition air strikes and artillery fire pounding IS positions. Up to 600 jihadists are thought to be defending their last stronghold, a small pocket in Syria's eastern province of Deir al-Zour. Two years ago IS controlled large areas of Syria and Iraq. On Saturday, after a pause of more than a week to allow some 20,000 civilians to leave the area, SDF spokesman Mustafa Bali said the group was launching the ""final battle to crush IS"". Some civilians are believed to be still in the area. An SDF field commander told AFP news agency on Sunday morning:  ""There are heavy clashes at the moment. We have launched an assault and the fighters are advancing."" Monitors the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said the SDF were advancing across farmland, and there were heavy clashes and landmines going off. Has IS been defeated? Families flee last IS village in Syria Islamic State group: The full story Backed by air strikes, the SDF have driven out IS from towns and villages in north-eastern Syria in recent months. This video can not be played 'My son was an IS fighter, now I'm trying to save his children' At its peak in 2014, IS established a ""caliphate"" stretching across Syria and Iraq that was similar in size to the UK and ruled over more than 7.7 million people. In December, US President Donald Trump said IS militants were ""mostly gone"" and announced the US would withdraw all of its 2,000 troops from Syria. On Wednesday he said: ""It should be announced, probably some time next week, that we will have 100% of the caliphate."" Analysis by BBC Arab Affairs editor Sebastian Usher The battle for the tiny sliver of land still held by IS next to the Iraqi border has been raging for many hours. Air strikes and artillery fire have pummelled the IS position, which measures only about a mile across. The SDF believes it will shortly achieve a decisive victory. IS does still hold another scrap of territory in Syria - and it continues to carry out dozens of attacks - many targeting the SDF. Even as it seems likely to lose every last fragment of its once-vaunted and self-declared caliphate, IS can continue to operate and pose a potent threat in both Syria and Iraq from remote areas where its fighters find refuge, as well as through militants gone to ground in towns and cities. IS has suffered substantial losses, but the UN says it still reportedly controls between 14,000 and 18,000 militants in Iraq and Syria, including up to 3,000 foreigners. Meanwhile, there are significant numbers of IS-affiliated militants in Afghanistan, Egypt, Libya, South-East Asia and West Africa, and to a lesser extent in Somalia, Yemen, Sinai and the Sahel. Individuals inspired by the group's ideology also continue to carry out attacks elsewhere.

"Prince Philip, 97, gives up driving licence","Prince Philip was seen driving a replacement Land Rover two days after the crash The Duke of Edinburgh is to voluntarily give up his driving licence, Buckingham Palace has said. It comes after the 97-year-old duke apologised over a car crash near the Sandringham estate in Norfolk, in which his Land Rover Freelander landed on its side after a collision with a Kia. Two days later Norfolk Police gave him ""suitable words of advice"" after he was pictured driving without a seat belt. Buckingham Palace said that he surrendered his licence on Saturday. In a statement, the palace said: ""After careful consideration the Duke of Edinburgh has taken the decision to voluntarily surrender his driving licence."" Norfolk Police confirmed that the duke had surrendered his licence to officers and it would now be returned to the DVLA. The investigation file for the collision has been passed to the Crown Prosecution Service, which said it would take the latest development into account. Police speak to Philip for not wearing seat belt Prince Philip's car 'careered' across road Speed camera delay on duke crash road BBC royal correspondent Jonny Dymond, said the decision to give up his licence was entirely down to the duke, according to Buckingham Palace. ""The duke is reported to have acknowledged that the collision last month was his fault,"" he said. ""There was a fair deal of criticism of his decision to drive just two days after the crash.  Now he has chosen to give up some of his independence and will have a driver from this point on."" The duke wrote to a woman injured in the crash, which happened on 17 January on the A149 near the Queen's country estate. He escaped injury, but Emma Fairweather, a passenger in the Kia, broke her wrist. The Kia was carrying three people, including a nine-month-old baby boy, his mother who was driving and Ms Fairweather, 46. In the letter to Ms Fairweather, dated 21 January andreproduced by the Sunday Mirror,external, the duke acknowledged the ""very distressing experience"". ""I would like you to know how very sorry I am for my part in the accident,"" he wrote, on Sandringham House headed paper. ""The sun was shining low over the main road. In normal conditions I would have no difficulty in seeing traffic coming... but I can only imagine that I failed to see the car coming, and I am very contrite about the consequences."" Ms Fairweather had previously criticised the duke for a lack of communication following the crash. The mother-of-two told the Sunday Mirror: ""I thought it was really nice that he signed off as 'Philip' and not the formal title. I was pleasantly surprised because of the personalised nature."" After the crash, Royal biographer Hugo Vickers told BBC News: ""Any kind of car accident at the age of 97 is likely to produce shock. ""Some years ago he gave up flying planes long before he needed to because he was scared that if something happened there would be a lot of criticism. ""You know, why was he, at the age of 55, still flying a plane when he should have retired at 48 or something like that. ""So he does listen to these things - he's very, very sensible."" There is no legal age at which motorists must stop driving, however doctors can advise drivers to give up their entitlements. If a motorist has a medical condition which affects their driving, it may mean they have to give up their licence until they can meet the medical standards to drive again. If a driver decides to surrender their licence, or they are advised to do so by a doctor, they must write a letter to the Driver and Vehicle Licensing Agency (DVLA), accompanied by the existing licence, or a good excuse for not enclosing it. In 2016, the duke famously drove the Obamas when the then US president and First Lady visited Windsor. This video can not be played Prince Philip was 94 when he drove the Obamas and his wife, the Queen Prince Philip retired from public life in August 2017 having spent decades supporting the Queen and attending events for his own charities and organisations. Buckingham Palace calculated he had completed 22,219 solo engagements since 1952. Since retiring from official solo duties, he has appeared in public alongside the Queen and other members of the Royal Family at events and church services.

"Concern over Brexit effect on Irish rugbyBrexit could disrupt the ""unique balance that makes Irish rugby successful,"" says Ulster's Darren Cave.","Ulster rugby player Darren Cave gave his political views in a candid column for a sport website Ex-international Darren Cave has said his generation ""couldn't stomach"" it if Brexit disrupted the ""unique balance that makes Irish rugby so successful"". In a candid column for theSports Chronicle,external, the Ulster centre said the Brexit deadlock was a ""threat"" to the Good Friday peace deal. ""Being a proud Ulsterman and playing for Ireland should not be complicated in the 21st Century,"" he added. Cave also expressed dismay at the ""very sad state of affairs"" at Stormont. Cave, from Holywood in County Down, has been capped 11 times by Ireland, making his last international appearance in 2015. ""After everything we've been through in Northern Ireland, can you imagine the most successful Ireland captain ever - Rory Best - having to drive through a hard border to play at the Aviva Stadium?"" the 31 year old said. ""How is this good for my generation?"" Cave questioned whether Rory Best would have to ""drive through a hard border"" to captain Ireland in Dublin Cave said he could not remember the Troubles but he viewed the Brexit deadlock as a ""threat"" to the Good Friday Agreement, which led to peace in Northern Ireland. The UK's withdrawal from the EU had ""consumed my thoughts of late"", he said, and it ""deeply concerns my generation as peace is all we have ever known"". Cave also commented on the impasse at Stormont, saying Northern Ireland's politics was ""still in a dreadful place"". ""The political landscape... is a very sad state of affairs,"" he added. ""I don't know how it is going to change as the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) versus Sinn FÃ©in saga rumbles ever on with the two communities entrenched on either side."" Cave said the global perception of the Republic of Ireland had ""radically altered"" He said problems with issues such as healthcare and homelessness had been ""ignored"" since the collapse of the Northern Ireland Assembly in January 2017. ""For over two years our elected officials have steadfastly refused to govern,"" said Cave. That meant that societal issues such as same-sex marriage and abortion had not been addressed in Northern Ireland, he added. Recent constitutional referendums in the Republic of Ireland havescrapped the country's ban on abortionandlegalised same-sex marriage. ""What is so depressing is that during this very same period of time the global perception of Ireland, has been radically altered following the [same-sex marriage and abortion] referendums,"" said Cave. ""Gone are so many old perceptions and in their stead appears Dublin, this modern, multi-cultural society.""

Darwin school play axed after complaints,"Charles Darwin is the founder of modern evolutionary studies A school has axed a musical on evolution over its suggestive lyrics and portrayal of Christian views. Darwin Rocks, about the scientist Charles Darwin, was due to be performed by about 90 pupils at Hartford Manor Primary School, Cheshire, next month. The move follows six ""expressions of concern"" from parents, the school said. The musical's publishers Musicline said it was written by a Christian, adding ""we can't ever recall having courted controversy before"". The musical includes scenes from across Darwin's life, including his journey on HMS Beagle According to its website,,externalthe production is a ""light-hearted look"" at the work of Darwin, whosetheory of evolution,external, published in 1859, shocked Victorian society by suggesting animals and humans shared a common ancestry. Head teacher Simon Kidwell told the BBC that the school, in Hartford near Northwich, received six ""expressions of concern"" over lyrics that refer to ""bump and grind"" - a sexually suggestive dance move. He said three of those parents also believed a bishop was ""mocked"" in a separate scene. ""There were concerns about caricature,"" he said, adding the complainants, who include a science teacher from another school, felt its representation of Christian views on science ""wasn't accurate"". One parent said they did not want their daughter to think her ambition to be an engineer contradicted Christian beliefs, Mr Kidwell said. He added the school board was not involved in the decision to drop the production and denied newspaper suggestions a local vicar who is on the board had influenced the move. Darwin stopped going to church in his 40s and described himself in later life as an agnostic The school teaches evolution as part of the syllabus and no parents have withdrawn their children from those lessons, Mr Kidwell said. Mike Smith, managing director at Musicline, said the firm ""asked Steve Titford - a practising Christian - and the writer of Shakespeare Rocks to write a factual musical about Charles Darwin's life and beliefs"". He said it had been ""received with enthusiasm"" and been performed in schools around the world since 2017. ""You can't please all the people all the time, but having been in the school musical business for over 25 years, we can't ever recall having courted controversy before,"" Mr Smith added. Martin Bashir, BBC religion editor The traditional (and often lazy) depiction of faith v science is old hat. In Britain and the US, there are multiple experts who see no conflict with holding religious beliefs alongside their strong grasp of science. Theistic evolutionists include Francis Collins - the geneticist who led the Human Genome Project and the current director of the National Institutes of Health in the US. David Wilkinson, the astrophysicist and principal of St John's College, Durham, is also a Methodist lay minister - and often contributes to Thought for the Day. It's not a surprise there has been some objection to the ""mockery"" of Christians, who are often depicted as anti-intellectual and anti-science.
