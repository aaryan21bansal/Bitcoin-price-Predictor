One dead as gas explosion tears through flats,"This video can not be played The flats partially collapsed following the blast One person has died and three others were taken to hospital after a ""major gas explosion"" and a huge fire at a block of flats in Bedford. Bedfordshire Police said further bodies could be found in the coming days after 20 flats were engulfed in flames in Redwood Grove. Eyewitnesses described hearing an explosion at about 09:30 BST. The fire service said an investigation was under way and more details would become known in the coming days. Ch Supt John Murphy said: ""Very sadly we know that at least one person has passed away in the explosion today. ""There is a possibility that there will be more fatalities discovered in the coming days as we continue to search through the scene and a number of people, as my colleague from the fire services has identified, were injured as well today."" An aerial platform was used to fight the flames Adrian Mazurkiwicz, who lives in a top floor flat in a three-storey block adjoining the one where the explosion happened, said he saw two people jump from windows to escape the blaze. He told how on hearing the explosion, he and his partner rushed to ""start knocking on people's doors to get everybody out, and then when I was outside the building I saw the walls being torn apart... and all of the windows out, and smoke and flames pretty much instantly"". ""I saw a couple of people jump out of the building and started helping them out... bringing them away from the fire, away from the danger, but it was a very, very serious and very big explosion,"" he said. Adrian Mazurkiwicz helped pull one man away from the fire after the man had jumped from his flat Mr Mazurkiwicz's flat has been destroyed in the blaze. He said he hoped his neighbours in the building were all ""OK"". ""We saw people jumping out from the flat that was directly affected,"" he said. ""I think that was the flat that blew up, and that was where the gentleman jumped out and hurt his hip really badly - we pulled him away. ""And then I saw another gentleman on the other side of the building - seems like he's just been blown out of the window by the whole explosion."" He added: ""The walls [of the building] have just been completely cracked like a walnut - there's been so much debris flying out of everywhere - ashes, smoke, dust, fire - just instantly everywhere - blazing out of the windows - and that's why people started to jump out."" This video can not be played Witness Alex Feltham said he heard ""a large boom"" at about 09:30 BST ""and the roof of the block of flats had been destroyed"" An emergency centre has been set up at The John Bunyan Centre in Bedford for evacuees and those needing support, police said. Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service said the fire was caused by a ""major gas explosion"" and urged people to keep doors and windows closed. Witness Alex Feltham said after hearing the ""boom"" the block of flats became ""a raging inferno"". A block of flats next to the three-storey block where the explosion happened was also evacuated, police said Another witness, Adam Fisher, described ""a huge explosion"". ""Everyone went to our work car park to see what was happening,"" he said. ""Our building is adjacent to the apartment complex - immediately an inferno [was] visible, huge smoke cloud billowing, people screaming and people frantically calling for emergency services."" Everybody just looked after their loved ones and other people to make sure everybody was alright, said Dezso Balazs A block of flats next to the three-storey block where the explosion happened has also been evacuated, and police said they were ""working as quickly as we can to get people back into their homes as quickly as possible"". Dezso Balazs lives in a neighbouring block of flats. ""I heard a big noise like an explosion and then I grabbed my family and we came out and we saw the next flat block on fire. Part of the building had been blasted out. Everybody started to panic and run around. ""Everybody just looked after their loved ones and other people to make sure everybody was all right."" A nearby primary school was also been evacuated. Andy George, head of Shackleton Primary School, said: ""Following the fire in the Redwood Grove area of Bedford earlier today, pupils at Shackleton Primary have been sent home due to the school's proximity to the incident. ""All children are safe and the school is working with the emergency services. The school expects to re-open tomorrow.""

Second homes limit to be set by Welsh councils,"Gwynedd has the highest number of second homes in Wales Councils will be able to control numbers of second homes and holiday lets under new Welsh government plans. A new licensing scheme for people who want to operate short-term holiday lets, such as Airbnb, is also planned. First Minister Mark Drakeford and Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price made the announcement as made as part of their co-operation agreement. Local authorities have already been given thepower to increase council tax on second homesby 300% from next year. Business owners have previously said theyfear running holiday-lets will become impossible. There were 23,974 registered second homes in Wales at the beginning of 2022. What's Wales' problem with second homes? Are second home owners selling up in Wales? Rappers vent frustration over seaside second homes The changes to planning regulations are expected to be made by the end of the summer and will introduce three new classes of property in the planning system: a primary home, second home and short-term holiday accommodation. Local authorities will then be able to make amendments to the planning system, ""where they have evidence"", to require planning permission for change of use from one class to another. Under the new system, councils will also have the power to set a ceiling on numbers. Mr Drakeford, speaking at a joint press conference, said while tourism was ""vital"" to the Welsh economy, having too many holiday properties and second homes, which can lie empty for much of the year, damaged communities and priced people out of local housing markets. Mr Price added there had been an ""exponential growth"" in holiday lets and said the licensing scheme would help control the housing system and ""level the playing field"" for tourism accommodation providers. This video can not be played The Home Owners of Wales group said it was âfinancially ableâ to take on the Welsh government Work will also begin on allowing councils to apply increased Land Transaction Tax (LTT) on the purchase of second homes and holiday lets. Conservative local government spokesman Sam Rowlands, said: ""I welcome increased responsibilities and opportunities for local authorities to support their communities, but I do worry this is just a top-down diktat from Labour and Plaid Cymru in Cardiff Bay. ""Many councils, particularly those in north Wales and rural areas, have been underfunded for many years by the Labour government and struggle to fulfil their essential obligations."" As part of an effort to help people, especially first-time buyers, onto the property ladder, Mr Drakeford said the government was ""investigating the possibility"" of reintroducing local authority mortgages. He added: ""In this cost of living crisis, backing from a local authority would help people access mortgages with a smaller deposit."" The move could be opposed by property owners who have previously criticised having to pay four times their current level of council tax from next April. Paul Martin worried how businesses like his would be affected Paul Martin, runs bed and breakfast The Forest, in Newtown, Powys, which specialises in catering for autistic children. He said the Welsh government had not sufficiently defined what a second home was and worried the legislation would affect businesses like his. There was not enough time, he said, for businesses to prepare for changes. ""A property used occasionally for holidays by its owner, who lives a distance away, is a second home and that is the target of the legislation,"" said Mr Martin. ""But what about a self-contained annex to the primary home? Or a multi-property complex like mine? What about a business which has other revenue sources such as a golf course or yoga centre? What about properties in less popular locations."" The Home Owners of Wales Group described the rise as ""morally indefensible"".

"No case for UK returning to EU, Labour leader says","This video can not be played Keir Starmer: We're not trading on divisions The UK ""will not go back into the EU"" under a Labour government, Sir Keir Starmer has said, in a speech attacking the government's record on Brexit. The Labour leader vowed to ""move on arguments of the past"" and seek to ""make Brexit work"". He said the UK was ""stuck"" and needed a plan to get its ""economy growing again"". And he recommitted to keeping the UK out of the EU single market, customs union and free movement rules. Speaking to the BBC's political editor Chris Mason before the speech, Sir Keir said: ""We want to go forward, not backwards. And therefore this is not about rejoining the EU. ""It's very clear that what we can't do is reopen all those arguments, all those divisions that caused so much anguish over past years."" He said the economy was stagnant under the Conservative government and its Brexit deal was ""holding us back"". Labour's plan, he said, would focus on ""unblocking"" the government's Brexit deal by removing barriers to trade with the EU and taking steps to resolve border issues in Northern Ireland. NI Protocol can be fixed by hard work, says Starmer Why could parts of the Brexit deal be ditched? Starmer should fight election on Brexit - Benn The Labour leader's address marked an attempt to regain control over an issue that has been a dividing line between the party's MPs, members, and some of its voters. Sir Keir - who as Jeremy Corbyn's shadow Brexit secretary said the party should advocate staying in the EU in any second referendum - has largely avoided talking about Brexit during his time as leader. Before Monday, he had not made a set-piece speech on the issue since the UK cut legal ties with the EU, and mentioned it just five times in a11,500 word essayahead of Labour's annual conference last year. With official forecasterscontinuing to sayBrexit has damaged the UK's economy, he has faced pressure within Labour - including from London mayor Sadiq Khan - to push for Britain to rejoin the bloc's single market. On Monday Mr Khan told the BBC he disagreed with the party's position on Brexit and said the ""country's future is best served being members of the single market"". Others in the party have expressed similar sentiments, including shadow minister Anna McMorrin, who recentlytold a private meeting she hoped the UK could return to the EU single marketunder a Labour government. But in a speech at pro-EU think tank the Centre for European Reform, Sir Keir rejected that approach, arguing it would be a ""recipe for more division"". He added: ""There are some who say, 'We don't need to make Brexit work. We need to reverse it'. ""I couldn't disagree more, because you cannot move forward or grow the country or deliver change or win back the trust of those who have lost faith in politics if you're constantly focused on the arguments of the past."" What Sir Keir Starmer is doing today, in black and white, is making peace with Brexit. He will say explicitly that a Labour government would not return to the single market, customs union or freedom of movement. He has said these things before - but saying them all together is quite something. Unlike the Conservatives, Labour MPs and party members were not split down the middle on Brexit. The vast majority of them absolutely hated the idea. So today, the Labour leader is saying that argument is closed and he is turning a political leaf. He will hope by doing that, criticism can't come back the other way accusing his party of secretly wanting to take the UK back in. He will also hope it creates space to criticise the Tories' Brexit deal, not least on the Northern Ireland issue. Sir Keir also repeated his promise not to re-establish the EU's free movement rules in the UK, arguing instead he would seek new flexibilities for short work trips and touring musicians. The Labour leader said new trade barriers with Europe have created a ""fatberg of red tape"" for business to follow. He likened the economic effect of Brexit to the ""wet wipe island"" blocking the river Thames in London, adding: ""It is hampering the flow of British business â we will break that barrier down."" As part of a plan to ""make Brexit work"", the Labour leader promised to: strike a new UK-wide agreement the EU on veterinary standards in a bid to cut red tape for British food exporters restore the mutual recognition of professional qualifications and rules for testing products across ""specified sectors"" negotiate a ""new security pact"" with the EU to enable the sharing of more policing data and intelligence He also promised a new approach to post-Brexit border arrangements for Northern Ireland, which have proved highly unpopular among unionists. The government argues the provisions, which it signed up to as part of the 2019 withdrawal deal, are causing economic disruption and must be changed. After failing to secure the changes it wants during talks with the EU, it recentlytabled legislationenabling it to go back on parts of the deal it doesn't like. Border checks on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland are opposed by many unionists In his speech, Sir Keir accused minsters of ""lashing out"" and pledged to continue talks over the arrangements, known as the Northern Ireland protocol. ""The solutions are there, the desire is there. What is lacking is trust,"" he said. ""Labour will change that. We will be the honest broker our countries need."" He also attacked the government's approach to regulating the economy outside the EU, accusing them of cutting rules and then ""gawping at the power of the market"". ""The government have missed Brexit opportunities time and time again. It beggars belief that during a cost of living crisis that they still haven't cut VAT on energy bills,"" he added. ""Labour will be sharper than this. We will use our flexibility outside of the EU to ensure British regulation is adapted to suit British needs.""

"Soldiers sold ammunition for cash, court hears","Kirtland Gill, 41, denies conspiracy to sell or transfer ammunition Two serving soldiers sold hundreds of rounds of live ammunition for cash to an undercover police officer posing as a criminal, a court has heard. Coldstream Guard Kirtland Gill, 41, denies conspiracy to sell or transfer ammunition and possession of a prohibited weapon. Rajon Graham, 33, previously pleaded guilty to selling ammunition. Southwark Crown Court heard they had access to the bullets, issued for firing practice. At the time of the alleged offences - between December 2020 and January 2021 - Mr Gill was serving with the Coldstream Guards, part of the Household Division, responsible for the protection of the Queen and guarding Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle. Opening the case for the prosecution, Duncan Atkinson QC said the defendant was based at the Victoria Barracks in Windsor and was in charge of the allocation and management of ammunition issued for firing practice, the jury heard. Graham sold a total of 300 9mm Parabellum bulleted cartridges, which he called ""sweets"", wrapped in Bacofoil bags, for Â£5,800 in cash during four meetings with the buyer, who was actually an undercover police officer, referred to as ""D"". While it was Graham who met the undercover officer ""D"", he always made clear to ""D"" he was acting with others, the prosecutor said. Jurors were told that at Mr Gill's address in Cavalry Crescent, Windsor, police found Bacofoil bags and a Turkish 9mm multi-purpose, self-loading pistol. Cash was also found at his home, which included banknotes showing the same serial numbers as those handed by ""D"" to Graham on the 13 January, when 100 rounds of live ammunition were bought, the court heard. Mobile phone location data and police surveillance also linked Mr Gill to the plot, the jury was told. The trial, which is expected to last three weeks, continues.

Cinemas ban teens in suits after Minions mayhem,"In the five years since the minions' last movie appearance, fans have grown older and - sometimes - rowdier Some cinemas have banned young people wearing suits from screenings of Minions: The Rise of Gru over rowdy behaviour fuelled by a TikTok trend. Teenagers following the #gentleminions trend have been accused of making noise and throwing things during screenings. A staff member at one venue told the BBC they wanted to ensure the experience was not spoiled for younger children on their first cinema trip. Some cinemas said they have had to give huge numbers of refunds. Videos showing young people dressing up in suits to watch the movie in large groups and cheering loudly during the screening have gone viral on TikTok, racking up millions of views in some cases. The teenagers filmed themselves copying the characteristic steepled fingers of the movie's supervillain Felonious Gru and celebrated that ""the five year wait is over"" - referring to the time since the franchise's last instalment, Despicable Me 3. Movie studioUniversal Pictures endorsed the trend,external, saying on Twitter: ""to everyone showing up to @Minions in suits: we see you and we love you"". Allow Twitter content?

But cinemas have been less appreciative, with several complaining about the behaviour of the young fans drawn to the movie by TikTok. Guernsey's only cinema had to cancel further screenings of the movie, blaming ""stunningly bad behaviour"", including vandalism, throwing objects and abusing staff. Mallard Cinema manager Daniel Phillips-Smith said: ""It's been absolutely heartbreaking. We've had families who won't even go back into the screen when we've tried to sort it out, families leaving before the film has even started, and of course the children have been in tears."" The cinema had suffered a ""massive"" financial impact from all the refunds for customers' whose viewing of the film had been disturbed, he said. The Regal Cinema in Wadebridge, Cornwall, posted a notice saying it wouldno longer admit ""unaccompanied children wearing suits"",externalto screenings of the movie. Box office staff told the BBC young people in suits had been ""cheering, clapping, whooping"" and rising to their feet throughout the film. Allow Twitter content?

But some cinemagoers praised the behaviour of the #gentleminions at their screenings. Stace Woods, a teaching assistant from Surrey, said on social media that a group in suits when she saw the film were ""so much fun"" and ""so well-behaved"", adding they politely stopped bowing down and worshipping a giant poster of Gru so her children could pose for a photo with it. One parent told the Mansfield Chad the ban on young people in suits had extended to two boys in his 13-year-old son's group, who weremerely wearing white shirts with collars,external. They were reportedly turned away from their pre-booked screening until parents could drive down with a couple of jumpers to cover the offending items of smart clothing. A spokesperson for the Odeon said: ""Due to a small number of incidents in our cinemas over the weekend we have had to restrict access in some circumstances."" The Vue cinema chain said it was still welcoming all customers to see the film, which had been ""incredibly popular"" over the opening weekend. The Minions movie franchise, which began with 2010's Despicable Me, follows reformed supervillain Gru and his army of small, yellow henchmen, who quickly became the subject of endless online memes. The latest film tells Gru's origin story as an 11-year-old, struggling to break into the supervillain business.

Labour rules out general election deal with SNP,"This video can not be played Scottish Labour's Anas Sarwar: ""Let's be absolutely clear here, no deals, no pacts, no coalition with the SNP."" Labour will not do any deals with the SNP after the next general election, the party's Scottish leader has said. Anas Sarwar said there would be no pact between the parties even in the event of a hung parliament. The Scottish Labour leader was setting out his proposals for the future of the UK in a speech at Westminster. His proposals included a legal duty of cooperation for governments in London and Edinburgh, and a regional senate to replace the House of Lords. The SNP wants to hold an independence referendum on 19 October 2023, with leader and First Minister Nicola Sturgeon saying the next general election could be used as a single-issue vote if this is blocked. Is indyref2 Sturgeon's biggest political gamble? How will indyref2 compare with 2014? Mr Sarwar's speech in London comes the week after Ms Sturgeon set out her plans to pursue a fresh vote on independence. The Scottish Labour leader called for ""cooperation and not conflict"" to be put at the heart of government as he unveiled the first in a series of papers on reform of Scotland and the UK. This proposed introducing a ""legal duty to cooperate"" between the Scottish and UK governments, as well as a new governance forum which would ""bring together the leaders of the UK and the nations on an equal footing"". Mr Sarwar also called for the House of Lords to be abolished in favour of a senate of the nations and regions, which would include more representatives from around the UK and be ""more reflective of modern Britain"". He said: ""The political game-playing of recent years has wounded the devolution settlement. We need these new rules of engagement to heal it."" Nicola Sturgeon has set out her strategy to pursue a fresh referendum on independence Mr Sarwar ruled out any pacts or deals with the SNP in the event of a hung parliament at Westminster. He told BBC Scotland: ""We are trying to get an outright Labour majority at the next election. ""If we fall short of that and seek to form a Labour minority government, the SNP will face a clear choice - they can have a Tory government or a Labour government, and in that situation I dare Nicola Sturgeon and the SNP to back the Tories and let's see how Scotland responds."" In the speech, hosted by the Fabian Society, Mr Sarwar said the SNP and Tories had ""stoked up bitterness, division and anger and created a politics of us versus them"". He also attacked the leaders of the rival parties, claiming that Boris Johnson is ""a gift for the SNP"" and that Ms Sturgeon  ""wants to pit Scot against Scot for her own obsession"". Meanwhile the SNP accused Labour of being ""indistinguishable from the Tories on Brexit"", saying independence was the only path back into the EU for Scotland. Labour's UK leaderSir Keir Starmer is due to make a speech laterin which he will commit to keeping Britain out of the single market. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford said Sir Keir was ""offering no real change at all"", adding that there was ""no route back to Europe and economic prosperity at Westminster."" And the Tories said Mr Sarwar had repeatedly ruled out pacts with the SNP prior to May's council elections, only to joina cross-party coalition in Dumfries and Galloway. MSP and party chairman Craig Hoy said that ""pro-union voters know that only the Scottish Conservatives can be trusted to stand up to the SNP"". This speech was Anas Sarwar's attempt to carve out a distinctive position for Labour in the debate over Scotland's future. For years now the party has been an awkward third wheel in a binary tussle, with the SNP and Conservatives cementing their positions as the parties of independence and the union. In truth Labour would rather be talking about almost anything else, but with the constitution looking set to dominate Scottish politics through to the next election Mr Sarwar needs a clear policy to fall back on. Finding a third way through this issue tall order; just ask the Lib Dems, who have made very little headway with their calls for federalism in each election since 2014. The headlines will likely be dominated by talk of Mr Sarwar ruling out any post-election pacts with the SNP - something he also did prior to the Holyrood and council elections in 2021 and 2022. Really he has little choice but to rule out cooperation with other parties, given Labour badly needs to win back votes lost to both the SNP and the Tories over recent years. And for a Westminster election it also feels fairly obvious, given neither Labour nor SNP MPs are likely to vote to put Boris Johnson back in office, regardless of what deals might be on offer. No deals, no pacts, no coalition with SNP - Sarwar.

Public buildings need single-sex toilets - minister,"The government has said it wants all new public buildings in England to have separate male and female toilets. Equalities minister Kemi Badenoch said it was ""vital that women feel safe"" and ""that their needs are respected"". The ""rise in gender-neutral toilets"" meant female users had felt ""unfairly disadvantaged"" and faced longer queues, the government added. But transgender rights groups argue gender-neutral toilets can protect trans people from discrimination. The rights groups say that, along with other people who do not conform to the gender binary, trans people can face intrusive challenges when using male or female toilets. I'm trans so I've never used the school toilets The government announcement draws a distinction between gender-neutral toilets - which have shared waiting and hand-washing facilities along with a number of cubicles - and unisex toilets, which are single, standalone facilities used by both genders. The government says separate unisex - or universal - toilets should be provided in new public buildings if there is space, but should not be installed at the expense of female toilets. It said the revised approach, first mooted last year, would mean women, who may have to use facilities more often, for example because of pregnancy and sanitary needs, were guaranteed ""appropriate facilities"". The government's plans, which will require changes to building regulations and guidance, follow a call for evidence which began in late 2020. A further technical consultation will begin in the autumn, looking at the design of unisex self-contained cubicles to improve privacy, and what improvements are needed for disabled toilets. This video can not be played The government says its review of public toilets will help âensure there is a diversity of provision and facilities for everyone Ms Badenoch said: ""It is vital that women feel safe and comfortable when using public facilities, and that their needs are respected. ""These changes will ensure that separate toilets for men and women are preserved at the same time as providing universal toilets for those that want them. This is a common-sense approach."" The department said the proposed measures would apply to new public buildings over a certain size - which would be determined during the consultation process.

Putin presses on with Ukraine war after Lysychansk,"Russian shelling has laid waste to large areas of the city Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his defence minister to continue the offensive in Ukraine after Russia captured the city of Lysychansk. Mr Putin was shown on Russian TV calling on forces on other fronts to pursue their aims according to ""previously approved plans"". The capture means that all of Luhansk region is now in Russian hands. Earlier the region's Ukrainian governor said the city was abandoned so Russians would not destroy it from a distance. Soldiers have now moved to new fortified positions, Serhiy Haidai told the BBC. Losing the city and ceding control of Luhansk to Russia was painful, he said, but added: ""This is just one battle we have lost, but not the war."" He pleaded for more weapons from the West to offset the Russian advantage. President Volodymyr Zelensky has pledged that Ukrainian forces will return to retake Lysychansk ""thanks to the increase in the supply of modern weapons"". What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine? Russia has now stepped up its bombardment of cities in the neighbouring Donetsk region, with the areas around Sloviansk and the road between Lysychansk and Bakhmut in particular being targeted, according to Ukrainian forces. Together the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk form the industrial Donbas area. Mr Putin was seen telling Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu that troops who took part in the campaign to capture Luhansk should ""rest and develop their combat capabilities"". ""Other military units, including the East group and the West group, must carry out their tasks according to previously approved plans,"" he said, expressing the hope that on those fronts they would have similar success to that in Luhansk region. Just before he launched the invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, Mr Putin recognised all of Luhansk and Donetsk as independent states. Russian proxy forces began an insurgency there in 2014 - the year Russia also annexed the Crimean peninsula. Just over a week ago, Russian troops captured Severodonetsk - which Russian bombardment has reduced to ruins. Three Ukrainian soldiers who've served in the Donbas have described the fighting there as brutal. ""Russians like to destroy a city, a village, totally. Never mind who's there - Ukrainian civilians or military,"" Mark, a volunteer fighter just back from the front line in the Luhansk region, told me. Another soldier, Nikolai, told me he'd be lying if he didn't admit it was ""terrifying"". All three soldiers agree with Ukraine pulling back when its troops are outgunned: ""It's very hard to hold ground. It's a lot of deaths. There's nothing left there now anyway. No civilians. No city. They bombed it all."" They can't give details of casualties, but talked of ""so many"". ""People we studied with, shared food with, volunteers like us. Many are gone."" And yet, they insisted they would go back to the Donbas within days to fight on. Speaking about the decision to leave Lysychansk, Mr Haidai said: ""Our military could have held the city for a long time, but Russia currently has a huge advantage in artillery and ammunition. They would have simply destroyed the city from a distance, so there was no point in staying."" Mr Haidai said troops had now moved to positions in neighbouring Donetsk, but that 10,000 people remained in the city. In other developments: Ukraine needs $750bn for a recovery plan and Russian oligarchs should contribute to the cost, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal has told a reconstruction conference in Switzerland British Foreign Minister Liz Truss has called for a new Marshall Plan to rebuild Ukraine, in reference to the huge US aid programme for Europe after World War Two Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, told the conference that Russia wants to undermine Ukraine's existence, but it can emerge from the war as a stronger and more modern country Ukraine's military said it had raised the Ukrainian flag again on Snake Island, afterRussian troops left the tiny but strategic outcropin the Black Sea last week STOLEN GRAIN:Tracking where Russia takes Ukraine's grain ANALYSIS:Why Russia couldn't hold Snake Island FACT CHECKED:Russia's claims about shopping centre attack READ MORE:Full coverage of the crisis,external Ukraine war in maps: Ukraine's counter-offensive into Russian territory Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Surprise fall in inflation boosts interest rate cut hopes Why a small drop in inflation matters to you Family unaware missing sisters had ended Aberdeen tenancy What happens if TikTok is banned?

Pret sales jump as it focuses on towns and suburbs,"Pret A Manger says it has returned to profit after a tough few years, as it shifts its focus away from London towards regional towns and suburbs. Sales at the sandwich chain rose to Â£357.8m in the six months to June - up 230% on last year when lockdowns hammered the business. About a third of Pret's UK shops are now outside London, including new sites in Brentwood, Harrogate and York. These stores account for most of its recent growth, the chain said. Like all hospitality businesses, Pret had to close its sites for long spells during the pandemic and move to a takeaway model. But the chain said it returned to profit in March, after posting bruising losses of Â£225.9m and Â£343m in 2021 and 2020. Pret flooded with complaints over drinks deal Pret ups pay to Â£10 an hour for thousands of staff Pret raises coffee subscription price to Â£25 Since September last year the firm has opened 27 new shops across the country, mainly outside of central London, taking its UK portfolio to 442 shops. The chain - which was founded in London in 1986 - said 36% of its UK shops were now located in regional cities and towns. Pret also said it had expanded overseas, where it has 558 shops, striking new franchise deals in India, Spain, Portugal and Canada. The chain has tried to innovate since the pandemic hit, launching a drinks subscription service which initially sparked thousands of customer complaints over the limited availability of some beverages. But Pret said the service - which allows customers to have up to five hot drinks every day - was now used over a million times a week - up from 667,000 times a week last year. The service has boosted customer loyalty, it added, with subscribers ""typically spending four times as much with Pret than non-subscribers"".

US gun violence - in charts,"Data shows gun ownership in the US has grown over the last several years Gun violence is a fixture in American life - but the issue is a highly political one, pitting gun control advocates against people who are fiercely protective of their right to bear arms. We've looked into some of the numbers behind firearms in the US. There have been more than 488 mass shootings across the US so far in 2024,according to the Gun Violence Archive,external, which defines a mass shooting as an incident in which four or more people are injured or killed. Their figures include shootings that happen in homes and in public places. For each of the last four years there have been more than 600 mass shootings - almost two a day on average. He counts US shootings. He no longer remembers names The deadliest such attack, in Las Vegas in 2017, killed more than 50 people and left 500 wounded. The vast majority of mass shootings, however, leave fewer than 10 people dead. 48,830 people died from gun-related injuries in the US during 2021, according to data fromthe US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC),external. That was nearly an 8% increase from 2020, which was a record-breaking year for firearm deaths. While mass shootings and gun murders (homicides) generally garner much media attention, more than half of the total in 2021 were suicides. That year, more than 20,000 of the deaths were homicides,according to the CDC,external. Data shows more than 50 people are killed each day by a firearm in the US. That's a significantly larger proportion of homicides than is the case in Canada, Australia, England and Wales, and many other countries. While calculating the number of guns in private hands around the world is difficult, the latest figures from the Small Arms Survey - a Swiss-based research project - estimated that there were 390 million guns in circulation in the US in 2018. The US ratio of 120.5 firearms per 100 residents, up from 88 per 100 in 2011, far surpasses that of other countries around the world. Data from the US has suggested that gun ownership has grown significantly in recent years. A study, published bythe Annals of Internal Medicine in 2021,external, found that 7.5 million US adults became new gun owners between January 2019 and April 2021. That, in turn, exposed 11 million people to firearms in their homes, including 5 million children. About half of new gun owners in that time period were women, while 40% were either black or Hispanic. A majority of Americans are in favour of gun control. 57% of Americans surveyed said they wanted stricter gun lawsaccording to polling by Gallup,externalin November 2022. 32% said the laws should remain the same, while 10% of people surveyed said they should be ""made less strict"". The issue is extremely divisive, falling largely along party lines. ""Democrats are nearly unanimous in their support for stricter gun laws,""another Gallup study noted,externalin 2021, with nearly 91% in favour of stricter gun laws. Only 24% Republicans, on the other hand, agreed with the same statement, along with 45% of Independent voters. Some states have taken steps to ban or strictly regulate ownership of assault weapons. Laws vary by state but California, for example, has banned ownership of assault weapons with limited exceptions. Some controls are widely supported by people across the political divide - such as restrictions governing the sale of guns to people who are mentally ill or on ""watch"" lists. Despite years of financial woes and internal strife, the National Rifle Association (NRA) remains the most powerful gun lobby in the United States, with a substantial budget to influence members of Congress on gun policy. Over the last several election cycles, it, and other organisations, have consistently spent more on pro-gun rights messaging than their rivals in the gun control lobby. A number of states have also gone as far as to largely eliminate restrictions on who can carry a gun. In June 2021, for example, Texas Governor Greg Abbott signed into law a ""permitless carry bill"" that allows the state's residents to carry handguns without a licence or training. Similarly, in 2022, Georgia became the 25th in the nation to eliminate the need for a permit to conceal or openly carry a firearm. The law means any citizen of that state has the right to carry a firearm without a licence or a permit. The law was backed by the NRA, and leaders within the organisation called the move ""a monumental moment for the Second Amendment"". He counts US shootings.

Here are the latest developments:  For the latest updates, read our story here. Our live coverage was provided by Holly Honderich, Max Matza in the US and Alexandra Fouche and Malu Cursino in London. The debate over gun laws arises frequently in the wake of high-profile mass shootings in the US. Tuesday is the 186th day of the year, and the US has already seen 317 mass shootings in 2022. On average, they occur more than 11 times per week, according to the Gun Violence Archive organisation. A mass shooting is defined by the research group as an event in which four or more people are shot or killed, excluding the attacker. The killings in Highland Park have been the most widely-covered attack over the Independence Day weekend, but it is far from the only instance of recent fatal gun crime, which tends to rise in frequency during summer's hotter months. Also on Monday, two police officers were shot at a concert in Philadelphia, triggering panic among people who were there to watch fireworks. In Minneapolis, eight people were shot during an unofficial fireworks celebration. And in Gary, Indiana, three people were killed and seven wounded at a shooting at a holiday party in a residential neighbourhood. Less than 30 miles from Highland Park, 10 people were killed and 62 injured in shootings in Chicago - a drop over last year's total. Semi-automatic rifles, seen here, have been used in several of the country's worst recent shooting sprees This attack comes just weeks after the US Congress passed its first gun control law since 1994. The bipartisan bill came after mass shootings in Buffalo, New York and Uvalde in Texas triggered lawmakers to finally act. The new law contains several provisions, including allowing the FBI to access juvenile and health records from younger gun buyers aged 18 to 20. The law does not include a provision that gun control campaigners hoped for - raising the age to buy a semi-automatic rifle to 21. Many of the most deadly mass shootings in recent history have occurred using semi-automatic rifles. But the new law comes as the Supreme Court tears down a New York state law that required people to prove a special need in order to carry a gun in public. Their ruling said that all Americans have the right under the Constitution to carry a gun outside their home. State bans on assault rifles are also expected to fall in light of the latest Supreme Court ruling. Here's a quick recap of the developments in the investigation into the Highland Park mass shooting: Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot tells reporters she has been in
""constant contact"" with Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering. The two mayors have known each other for three decades,
Lightfoot said, after meeting in law school. ""The minute I understood what had happened I reached out to
her [Rotering] and offered anything that I could do,"" Lightfoot says.
""Unfortunately I have a lot of experience here."" Lightfoot says she offered the support of the Chicago Police
Department, who ""sprang into action"". ""Whatever you need, we will be here for you,"" she
says.  President Joe Biden has ordered the American flag be lowered to half mast at the White House and other government buildings after Monday's shooting. ""As a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of gun violence perpetrated on our Independence Day, July 4, 2022, in Highland Park, Illinois, by the authority vested in me as President of the United States by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby order that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff,"" the president proclamation says. The flags will fly like that until 9 July. Biden made a similar proclamation just weeks ago, after the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas. What else did we learn during the Chicago police press conference about Monday's Highland Park attack? Officials said Robert E Crimo was dressed as a woman during the attack to hide his facial tattoos and help him escape in the crowd. The authorities also said they aimed to reveal charges against the suspect on Tuesday afternoon US time. Crime task force spokesman Chris Covelli says at this point authorities have not been able to identify any clear motive for the attack. Asked by reporters about the gunman's weapons, Covelli says Crimo used at least two rifles and pistols. All weapons examined were purchased lawfully by Crimo. Covelli adds that shooting appears to be completely random and there are no reasons to believe the attack was motivated by religion or race. We've been hearing more from the spokesman for the Lake County Major Crime Task Force, Christopher Covelli. He says Crimo used his mother's car to escape the scene and blended in with the community because he concealed his identity by wearing women's clothing. Covelli adds that a second rifle was located inside Crimo's mother's car. He adds that Crimo remains in custody, and there are no indications he was acting with anyone else. Highland Park's authorities are delivering a news conference about the Fourth of July parade shooting, where six people were killed. Police say Robert E Crimo, 21, planned this attack for several weeks. Christopher Covelli, spokesman for Lake County Major Crime Task Force, says significant amount of information have been obtained from cell phone recordings and other footage. Crimo was dressed in women's clothing to conceal his identity, Covelli says. More than 70 rounds were fired from a legally purchased rifle, Covelli adds. We've heard from US President Joe Biden in the aftermath of the shootings and from the state's governor. Now its the turn of Illinois' lieutenant governor Juliana Stratton who says in atweet,external: ""Enough is enough."" Stratton echoed the governor's statement when he said gun violence was ""our uniquely American plague"". She added: ""I'm angry too. We all should be."" Highland Park's Independence Day shooting killed six people, and left at least three dozen others injured. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot is speaking out about the ""horrible tragedy"" in Highland Park. Lightfoot appears with other Illinois lawmakers to discuss a bipartisan bill meant to address gun violence. ""The gun violence epidemic is deep and pervasive,"" she says. ""We saw that play out again in Highland Park yesterday."" Lightfoot says she has been in ""constant contact"" with Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering. Gun violence is not just a Chicago problem, Lightfoot says. ""Gun violence knows no
borders or boundaries."" The bill, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, is meant to reduce gun violence nationwide. It includes enhanced background checks, a $250m (Â£205m) investment in community violence intervention and $100m for the national background check system. This video can not be played People, who had set up deck chairs in the street to watch the annual Independence Day parade, ran for safety as multiple shots rang out shortly after 1000 local time in Highland Park on 4 July. Toddlers in pushchairs, babes in arms, teenagers and the elderly fled the scene - and the gunfire - in fear for their lives and the lives of their loved ones. ""He started shooting again, and we ran behind the building and I put my son in a dumpster,"" recalled one bystander. ""It was just horrible."" Nomia IqbalReporting from Highland Park Illinois Senator Dick Durbin is here to view the remnants of the
Fourth of July parade. The Democrat looks shaken and tells me he is heart-broken
at what's happened. ""Are mass shootings now a tradition in America?"" I ask
him. ""I donât want
it to be but itâs becoming one,"" he sighs He backed recent major gun legislation aimed at addressing US gun
violence. He tells me it was an ""improvement"" but didnât go as far as
it should have. Senator Durbin says we have yet to see whether those new laws
would have stopped the gunman here. Illinois has tough gun laws but overall gun crime is high here. Republicans often point to Chicago as an example of a place
where gun control doesn't work. But some context - a report
in recent years from the city's police department has found a lot of guns come
from outside of Chicago and from neighbouring states like Kentucky and
Tennessee where the gun laws are more lax. The state of Illinois has the sixth strictest gun laws in the US,according to gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety,external. It also has the ninth lowest rate of gun ownership, according to the group. The state has universal background checks and requires firearms to be safely stored - but it does not ban assault weapons. Nancy Rotering, Highland Park's mayor, has told CNN the alleged shooter obtained his weapon legally. She criticised current gun laws, which enable individuals to lawfully purchase weapons. Rotering said: ""That being said, again, if you can have a weekly mass shooting with a legally purchased gun, then I think we need to talk about why those laws aren't protecting the very people that they're supposed to be protecting."" US President Joe Biden signed into law a landmark gun control bill in June, which aims to impose tougher checks on young buyers and encourage states to remove guns from people considered a threat. Robert Crimo, the alleged Independence Day shooter, has not yet been charged. But Rotering said she expects him to be charged today. So far, police have identified him as a ""person of interest"". Nomia IqbalReporting from Highland Park Ken Pell is picking up his granddaughters' scooters. His wife
and family were at the parade and dumped everything for safety. ""I wasn't here, I was at a nearby golf club and got
notification of a shooting. We were then put into a basement for safety. I
couldnât get a signal and I was so panicked as I couldnât get hold of my family
for ages."" His daughter told him to leave the scooters because taking them
back ""would be bad karma"". ""I couldn't do that I wanted to collect them. My grandkids
donât seem too affected at the moment but you know my daughter is not doing
well. She is questioning raising her kids in a place like this."" The motivations of the gunman are unknown. Ken is Jewish and
says this is a predominantly Jewish area so he is worried that's why it may
have been targeted. ""We just never thought we would be hit like this but I
guess neither did Uvalde [the site of a mass school shooting]."" What does the data tell us about gun culture in the US and its impact? Here are some key charts. How many guns are there in the US? While calculating the number of guns in private hands around the world is difficult, figures from the Small Arms Survey - a Swiss-based leading research project - estimate that there were 390 million guns in circulation in 2018. The US ratio of 120.5 firearms per 100 residents, up from 88 per 100 in 2011, far surpasses that of other countries around the world. How do US gun killings compare with other countries?  Nearly 53 people are killed each day by a firearm in the US, according to the official data from 2020. The data also shows that the vast majority of murders, 79%, were carried out with guns. That's a significantly larger proportion of homicides than is the case in Canada, Australia, England and Wales, and many other countries Who supports gun control?  Despite widespread and vocal public outrage - often in the wake of gun violence - American support for stricter gun laws in 2020 fell to the lowest level since 2014,according to polling by Gallup,external. Only 52% of Americans surveyed said they wanted stricter gun laws, while 35% said they should remain the same. The issue is also one that is hyper-partisan - the Gallup study noted that Democrats are nearly unanimous in their support for stricter gun laws. Only 24% Republicans agreed with the same statement. See more key data and charts here The Independence Day parade in Highland Park, Illinois, was scheduled to include floats, marching bands, and community entertainment as part of the city's Fourth of July celebrations. But around 10:15 local time (15:15 GMT) - just a few minutes after the parade had begun - a gunman who had climbed on to a roof near the parade route began shooting randomly at spectators using a high-powered rifle. What should have been one of the happiest days of the year quickly turned to panic, with pushchairs, purses and lawn chairs left discarded on the street as crowds fled from the scene. Some witnesses said they thought the sound of gunfire was fireworks. Police later recovered ""evidence of a firearm"" from the rooftop of a shop near to the parade route Five adults were killed at the scene, as well as a further victim who the local coroner said died in a nearby hospital. At least three dozen others were injured. At least eight victims remain in hospitals across Chicagoland (the Chicago metropolitan area) following yesterday's shooting, Jim
Anthony, spokesman for the North Shore University hospital group says. He did not provide updates on the patients' conditions. Thirty-eight patients were initially admitted for treatment after the parade, Anthony said, at three of the group's hospitals: Evanston Hospital, Glenbrook Hospital and Highland Park Hospital. ""We were able to mobilise quickly,"" Anthony said. ""Our physicians and nurses and medical support
staff train for situations like this, not that we ever want to see them in real
life."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

And in Gary, Indiana, three people were killed and seven wounded at a shooting at a holiday party in a residential neighbourhood. Less than 30 miles from Highland Park, 10 people were killed and 62 injured in shootings in Chicago - a drop over last year's total. Semi-automatic rifles, seen here, have been used in several of the country's worst recent shooting sprees This attack comes just weeks after the US Congress passed its first gun control law since 1994. The bipartisan bill came after mass shootings in Buffalo, New York and Uvalde in Texas triggered lawmakers to finally act. The new law contains several provisions, including allowing the FBI to access juvenile and health records from younger gun buyers aged 18 to 20. The law does not include a provision that gun control campaigners hoped for - raising the age to buy a semi-automatic rifle to 21. Many of the most deadly mass shootings in recent history have occurred using semi-automatic rifles. But the new law comes as the Supreme Court tears down a New York state law that required people to prove a special need in order to carry a gun in public. Their ruling said that all Americans have the right under the Constitution to carry a gun outside their home. State bans on assault rifles are also expected to fall in light of the latest Supreme Court ruling. Here's a quick recap of the developments in the investigation into the Highland Park mass shooting: Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot tells reporters she has been in
""constant contact"" with Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering. The two mayors have known each other for three decades,
Lightfoot said, after meeting in law school. ""The minute I understood what had happened I reached out to
her [Rotering] and offered anything that I could do,"" Lightfoot says.
""Unfortunately I have a lot of experience here."" Lightfoot says she offered the support of the Chicago Police
Department, who ""sprang into action"". ""Whatever you need, we will be here for you,"" she
says.  President Joe Biden has ordered the American flag be lowered to half mast at the White House and other government buildings after Monday's shooting. ""As a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of gun violence perpetrated on our Independence Day, July 4, 2022, in Highland Park, Illinois, by the authority vested in me as President of the United States by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby order that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff,"" the president proclamation says. The flags will fly like that until 9 July. Biden made a similar proclamation just weeks ago, after the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas. What else did we learn during the Chicago police press conference about Monday's Highland Park attack? Officials said Robert E Crimo was dressed as a woman during the attack to hide his facial tattoos and help him escape in the crowd. The authorities also said they aimed to reveal charges against the suspect on Tuesday afternoon US time. Crime task force spokesman Chris Covelli says at this point authorities have not been able to identify any clear motive for the attack. Asked by reporters about the gunman's weapons, Covelli says Crimo used at least two rifles and pistols. All weapons examined were purchased lawfully by Crimo. Covelli adds that shooting appears to be completely random and there are no reasons to believe the attack was motivated by religion or race. We've been hearing more from the spokesman for the Lake County Major Crime Task Force, Christopher Covelli. He says Crimo used his mother's car to escape the scene and blended in with the community because he concealed his identity by wearing women's clothing. Covelli adds that a second rifle was located inside Crimo's mother's car. He adds that Crimo remains in custody, and there are no indications he was acting with anyone else. Highland Park's authorities are delivering a news conference about the Fourth of July parade shooting, where six people were killed. Police say Robert E Crimo, 21, planned this attack for several weeks. Christopher Covelli, spokesman for Lake County Major Crime Task Force, says significant amount of information have been obtained from cell phone recordings and other footage. Crimo was dressed in women's clothing to conceal his identity, Covelli says. More than 70 rounds were fired from a legally purchased rifle, Covelli adds. We've heard from US President Joe Biden in the aftermath of the shootings and from the state's governor. Now its the turn of Illinois' lieutenant governor Juliana Stratton who says in atweet,external: ""Enough is enough."" Stratton echoed the governor's statement when he said gun violence was ""our uniquely American plague"". She added: ""I'm angry too. We all should be."" Highland Park's Independence Day shooting killed six people, and left at least three dozen others injured. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot is speaking out about the ""horrible tragedy"" in Highland Park. Lightfoot appears with other Illinois lawmakers to discuss a bipartisan bill meant to address gun violence. ""The gun violence epidemic is deep and pervasive,"" she says. ""We saw that play out again in Highland Park yesterday."" Lightfoot says she has been in ""constant contact"" with Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering. Gun violence is not just a Chicago problem, Lightfoot says. ""Gun violence knows no
borders or boundaries."" The bill, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, is meant to reduce gun violence nationwide. It includes enhanced background checks, a $250m (Â£205m) investment in community violence intervention and $100m for the national background check system. This video can not be played People, who had set up deck chairs in the street to watch the annual Independence Day parade, ran for safety as multiple shots rang out shortly after 1000 local time in Highland Park on 4 July. Toddlers in pushchairs, babes in arms, teenagers and the elderly fled the scene - and the gunfire - in fear for their lives and the lives of their loved ones. ""He started shooting again, and we ran behind the building and I put my son in a dumpster,"" recalled one bystander. ""It was just horrible."" Nomia IqbalReporting from Highland Park Illinois Senator Dick Durbin is here to view the remnants of the
Fourth of July parade. The Democrat looks shaken and tells me he is heart-broken
at what's happened. ""Are mass shootings now a tradition in America?"" I ask
him. ""I donât want
it to be but itâs becoming one,"" he sighs He backed recent major gun legislation aimed at addressing US gun
violence. He tells me it was an ""improvement"" but didnât go as far as
it should have. Senator Durbin says we have yet to see whether those new laws
would have stopped the gunman here. Illinois has tough gun laws but overall gun crime is high here. Republicans often point to Chicago as an example of a place
where gun control doesn't work. But some context - a report
in recent years from the city's police department has found a lot of guns come
from outside of Chicago and from neighbouring states like Kentucky and
Tennessee where the gun laws are more lax. The state of Illinois has the sixth strictest gun laws in the US,according to gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety,external. It also has the ninth lowest rate of gun ownership, according to the group. The state has universal background checks and requires firearms to be safely stored - but it does not ban assault weapons. Nancy Rotering, Highland Park's mayor, has told CNN the alleged shooter obtained his weapon legally. She criticised current gun laws, which enable individuals to lawfully purchase weapons. Rotering said: ""That being said, again, if you can have a weekly mass shooting with a legally purchased gun, then I think we need to talk about why those laws aren't protecting the very people that they're supposed to be protecting."" US President Joe Biden signed into law a landmark gun control bill in June, which aims to impose tougher checks on young buyers and encourage states to remove guns from people considered a threat. Robert Crimo, the alleged Independence Day shooter, has not yet been charged. But Rotering said she expects him to be charged today. So far, police have identified him as a ""person of interest"". Nomia IqbalReporting from Highland Park Ken Pell is picking up his granddaughters' scooters. His wife
and family were at the parade and dumped everything for safety. ""I wasn't here, I was at a nearby golf club and got
notification of a shooting. We were then put into a basement for safety. I
couldnât get a signal and I was so panicked as I couldnât get hold of my family
for ages."" His daughter told him to leave the scooters because taking them
back ""would be bad karma"". ""I couldn't do that I wanted to collect them. My grandkids
donât seem too affected at the moment but you know my daughter is not doing
well. She is questioning raising her kids in a place like this."" The motivations of the gunman are unknown. Ken is Jewish and
says this is a predominantly Jewish area so he is worried that's why it may
have been targeted. ""We just never thought we would be hit like this but I
guess neither did Uvalde [the site of a mass school shooting]."" What does the data tell us about gun culture in the US and its impact? Here are some key charts. How many guns are there in the US? While calculating the number of guns in private hands around the world is difficult, figures from the Small Arms Survey - a Swiss-based leading research project - estimate that there were 390 million guns in circulation in 2018. The US ratio of 120.5 firearms per 100 residents, up from 88 per 100 in 2011, far surpasses that of other countries around the world. How do US gun killings compare with other countries?  Nearly 53 people are killed each day by a firearm in the US, according to the official data from 2020. The data also shows that the vast majority of murders, 79%, were carried out with guns. That's a significantly larger proportion of homicides than is the case in Canada, Australia, England and Wales, and many other countries Who supports gun control?  Despite widespread and vocal public outrage - often in the wake of gun violence - American support for stricter gun laws in 2020 fell to the lowest level since 2014,according to polling by Gallup,external. Only 52% of Americans surveyed said they wanted stricter gun laws, while 35% said they should remain the same. The issue is also one that is hyper-partisan - the Gallup study noted that Democrats are nearly unanimous in their support for stricter gun laws. Only 24% Republicans agreed with the same statement. See more key data and charts here The Independence Day parade in Highland Park, Illinois, was scheduled to include floats, marching bands, and community entertainment as part of the city's Fourth of July celebrations. But around 10:15 local time (15:15 GMT) - just a few minutes after the parade had begun - a gunman who had climbed on to a roof near the parade route began shooting randomly at spectators using a high-powered rifle. What should have been one of the happiest days of the year quickly turned to panic, with pushchairs, purses and lawn chairs left discarded on the street as crowds fled from the scene. Some witnesses said they thought the sound of gunfire was fireworks. Police later recovered ""evidence of a firearm"" from the rooftop of a shop near to the parade route Five adults were killed at the scene, as well as a further victim who the local coroner said died in a nearby hospital. At least three dozen others were injured. At least eight victims remain in hospitals across Chicagoland (the Chicago metropolitan area) following yesterday's shooting, Jim
Anthony, spokesman for the North Shore University hospital group says. He did not provide updates on the patients' conditions. Thirty-eight patients were initially admitted for treatment after the parade, Anthony said, at three of the group's hospitals: Evanston Hospital, Glenbrook Hospital and Highland Park Hospital. ""We were able to mobilise quickly,"" Anthony said. ""Our physicians and nurses and medical support
staff train for situations like this, not that we ever want to see them in real
life."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
One dead as gas explosion tears through flatsPolice warn further bodies could be found by emergency workers as they search the block of flats.,"This video can not be played The flats partially collapsed following the blast One person has died and three others were taken to hospital after a ""major gas explosion"" and a huge fire at a block of flats in Bedford. Bedfordshire Police said further bodies could be found in the coming days after 20 flats were engulfed in flames in Redwood Grove. Eyewitnesses described hearing an explosion at about 09:30 BST. The fire service said an investigation was under way and more details would become known in the coming days. Ch Supt John Murphy said: ""Very sadly we know that at least one person has passed away in the explosion today. ""There is a possibility that there will be more fatalities discovered in the coming days as we continue to search through the scene and a number of people, as my colleague from the fire services has identified, were injured as well today."" An aerial platform was used to fight the flames Adrian Mazurkiwicz, who lives in a top floor flat in a three-storey block adjoining the one where the explosion happened, said he saw two people jump from windows to escape the blaze. He told how on hearing the explosion, he and his partner rushed to ""start knocking on people's doors to get everybody out, and then when I was outside the building I saw the walls being torn apart... and all of the windows out, and smoke and flames pretty much instantly"". ""I saw a couple of people jump out of the building and started helping them out... bringing them away from the fire, away from the danger, but it was a very, very serious and very big explosion,"" he said. Adrian Mazurkiwicz helped pull one man away from the fire after the man had jumped from his flat Mr Mazurkiwicz's flat has been destroyed in the blaze. He said he hoped his neighbours in the building were all ""OK"". ""We saw people jumping out from the flat that was directly affected,"" he said. ""I think that was the flat that blew up, and that was where the gentleman jumped out and hurt his hip really badly - we pulled him away. ""And then I saw another gentleman on the other side of the building - seems like he's just been blown out of the window by the whole explosion."" He added: ""The walls [of the building] have just been completely cracked like a walnut - there's been so much debris flying out of everywhere - ashes, smoke, dust, fire - just instantly everywhere - blazing out of the windows - and that's why people started to jump out."" This video can not be played Witness Alex Feltham said he heard ""a large boom"" at about 09:30 BST ""and the roof of the block of flats had been destroyed"" An emergency centre has been set up at The John Bunyan Centre in Bedford for evacuees and those needing support, police said. Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service said the fire was caused by a ""major gas explosion"" and urged people to keep doors and windows closed. Witness Alex Feltham said after hearing the ""boom"" the block of flats became ""a raging inferno"". A block of flats next to the three-storey block where the explosion happened was also evacuated, police said Another witness, Adam Fisher, described ""a huge explosion"". ""Everyone went to our work car park to see what was happening,"" he said. ""Our building is adjacent to the apartment complex - immediately an inferno [was] visible, huge smoke cloud billowing, people screaming and people frantically calling for emergency services."" Everybody just looked after their loved ones and other people to make sure everybody was alright, said Dezso Balazs A block of flats next to the three-storey block where the explosion happened has also been evacuated, and police said they were ""working as quickly as we can to get people back into their homes as quickly as possible"". Dezso Balazs lives in a neighbouring block of flats. ""I heard a big noise like an explosion and then I grabbed my family and we came out and we saw the next flat block on fire. Part of the building had been blasted out. Everybody started to panic and run around. ""Everybody just looked after their loved ones and other people to make sure everybody was all right."" A nearby primary school was also been evacuated. Andy George, head of Shackleton Primary School, said: ""Following the fire in the Redwood Grove area of Bedford earlier today, pupils at Shackleton Primary have been sent home due to the school's proximity to the incident.

"Soldiers sold ammunition for cash, court hearsKirtland Gill, 41, denies conspiracy to sell ammunition and possession of a prohibited weapon.Berkshire","Kirtland Gill, 41, denies conspiracy to sell or transfer ammunition Two serving soldiers sold hundreds of rounds of live ammunition for cash to an undercover police officer posing as a criminal, a court has heard. Coldstream Guard Kirtland Gill, 41, denies conspiracy to sell or transfer ammunition and possession of a prohibited weapon. Rajon Graham, 33, previously pleaded guilty to selling ammunition. Southwark Crown Court heard they had access to the bullets, issued for firing practice. At the time of the alleged offences - between December 2020 and January 2021 - Mr Gill was serving with the Coldstream Guards, part of the Household Division, responsible for the protection of the Queen and guarding Buckingham Palace and Windsor Castle. Opening the case for the prosecution, Duncan Atkinson QC said the defendant was based at the Victoria Barracks in Windsor and was in charge of the allocation and management of ammunition issued for firing practice, the jury heard. Graham sold a total of 300 9mm Parabellum bulleted cartridges, which he called ""sweets"", wrapped in Bacofoil bags, for Â£5,800 in cash during four meetings with the buyer, who was actually an undercover police officer, referred to as ""D"". While it was Graham who met the undercover officer ""D"", he always made clear to ""D"" he was acting with others, the prosecutor said. Jurors were told that at Mr Gill's address in Cavalry Crescent, Windsor, police found Bacofoil bags and a Turkish 9mm multi-purpose, self-loading pistol. Cash was also found at his home, which included banknotes showing the same serial numbers as those handed by ""D"" to Graham on the 13 January, when 100 rounds of live ammunition were bought, the court heard. Mobile phone location data and police surveillance also linked Mr Gill to the plot, the jury was told. The trial, which is expected to last three weeks, continues.

Fuel protesters arrested for driving too slowly,"This video can not be played Watch: Motorways brought to a standstill by fuel price protesters More than a dozen protesters were arrested for driving too slowly during demonstrations on motorways in England, Wales and Scotland over fuel prices. The go-slow action mainly targeted three-lane motorways with convoys of vehicles crawling along two lanes - leaving the ""fast"" outside lane free. Twelve people were arrested during a protest on the M4, which led to the Prince of Wales Bridge, between England and Wales, being closed. Another man was arrested near the A38. Protesters, organised under the social media banner Fuel Price Stand Against Tax, drove in a series of convoys at 30mph (48.3km/h) to cause gridlock on major roads and motorways. Chief Superintendent Tom Harding from Gwent Police said people had been arrested for driving under 30mph for a ""prolonged amount of time"". The roads affected by disruption included: the M4 and Prince of Wales Bridge the M5 in Devon the M32 in Gloucestershire the A38 in Devon the M180 in Lincolnshire the A12 in Essex the A92 in Scotland the A64 near York Gwent Police said organisers of the protest had been given a legal notice to prevent them from blocking the bridge over the River Severn and from driving under 30mph. Ch Supt Harding said restrictions had been placed on the protest as otherwise ""emergency and critical services"" would have been restricted. Tariq Akram said other cars joined the convoy as it went by Tariq Akram said his was one of 50 vehicles making the 60-mile journey through Scunthorpe and Doncaster at 20mph. The Scunthorpe truck driver told the BBC his company had added Â£4,000 to its fuel bill in the past four months because of rising prices. ""The turnout was absolutely fantastic. There were 35 vehicles from our yard alone who took part,"" he said. ""At one point, I thought some cars wanted to overtake so I tried to let them by, then I realised they were joining in."" Police Scotland has told drivers to drive at an appropriate speed for the conditions Avon and Somerset Police said all protests in its area had finished and thanked the public for their patience in a tweet at 15:20 BST. Earlier, Devon and Cornwall Police said it was aware of a go-slow protest heading northbound from Exeter services on the M5. The force also said a further protest began on the A38 heading north from Ivybridge, where a man in his 50s was arrested after ignoring a warning about unsafe driving. ""Unfortunately we have had unsafe driving on the A38 including vehicles travelling at a dangerously low speed,"" a force spokesman said. Why is petrol so expensive in the UK? Fact vs fiction: Five tips for saving petrol money examined Steve Nash, who got stuck on the M5, said the protesters might be ""going about it the wrong way"" Steve Nash, who was delayed on the M5 by protesters as he drove to Exeter Airport to return a hire car, is hopeful the delay will not result in a penalty fee. ""I'm not sure what they're achieving - other than inconveniencing people,"" he said. ""I'm not critical of the sentiment behind what they're trying to do, I just think they're possibly going about it the wrong way."" The retired civil servant from Tiverton said his journey that would usually take 20 minutes took an hour on Monday. He said he felt the protesters should be ""stood outside parliament or writing to their MPs"". ""I think it's not affecting the people you need to actually protest, which is Parliament. The protesters have actually inconvenienced everyone else who is inconvenienced by high fuel prices."" Police Scotland said it had beenaware of protests on motorways and trunk roadsand urged motorists to drive at an appropriate speed for the road conditions. But the force had warned journey times could be longer than normal. In Lincolnshire, police blocked junction one between the M180 and M18 forcing protesters to remain on the former. West Yorkshire Police said a ""single tyre deflation device"" - also known as a ""stinger"" - had been deployed, but it was not used. West Mercia Police said some of the tactics used during a protest on the M54, which had ended by about 08:30 BST, had ""compromised the safety of other road users"" and said officers wouldtake action against those who committed traffic offences. A Facebook event called Stand Up to Fuel Prices, with more than 57,000 responses, had called for people to take their cars, lorries and tractors to cause roadblocks all over the country ""until there is change"". The organisers wrote that fuel costs were driving up other costs of living and said they hoped the more people that joined the protest, the sooner living costs would drop. Fuel prices have risen to record highs in recent weeks with figures from data firm Experian showing the average price of a litre of petrol at UK forecourts had hit 191.5p and 199.0p for diesel on Sunday. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said there did not appear to be any sign of retailers reducing forecourt prices, despite weekly wholesale costs having fallen for five weeks. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said he will carefully consider calls for a ""more substantial"" fuel duty cut after the 5p per litre reduction implemented in March failed to halt price rises. Rising fuel prices have been pushed even higher by the war in Ukraine, with Russia, one of the world's largest oil exporters, facing sanctions. A convoy of vehicles on the M180 in Lincolnshire Police escort vehicles across the Prince of Wales Bridge, which runs between England and Wales The government had said while it understands people are struggling with rising prices and have a right to protest, ""people's day-to-day lives should not be disrupted"" and warned traffic delays ""will only add to fuel use"". Howard Cox, founder of campaign group FairFuelUK, said other countries had cut fuel duty more than the UK and called for a reduction of at least 20p. While he said his organisation was not involved in the protests, he said there was an appetite for them - and if the government did not deliver on the issue there could be ""some serious escalation of protests"".

Pritzker said US President Biden expressed shock and said he would not give up fighting the gun violence âepidemicâ Highland Park sits north of Chicago on the shores of Lake Michigan Edited by Claire Heald We're closing our live coverage of the shooting at an Independence Day parade in Highland Park near Chicago. Here are the latest developments:  For the latest updates, read our story here. Our live coverage was provided by Holly Honderich, Max Matza in the US and Alexandra Fouche and Malu Cursino in London. The debate over gun laws arises frequently in the wake of high-profile mass shootings in the US. Tuesday is the 186th day of the year, and the US has already seen 317 mass shootings in 2022. On average, they occur more than 11 times per week, according to the Gun Violence Archive organisation. A mass shooting is defined by the research group as an event in which four or more people are shot or killed, excluding the attacker. The killings in Highland Park have been the most widely-covered attack over the Independence Day weekend, but it is far from the only instance of recent fatal gun crime, which tends to rise in frequency during summer's hotter months. Also on Monday, two police officers were shot at a concert in Philadelphia, triggering panic among people who were there to watch fireworks. In Minneapolis, eight people were shot during an unofficial fireworks celebration. And in Gary, Indiana, three people were killed and seven wounded at a shooting at a holiday party in a residential neighbourhood. Less than 30 miles from Highland Park, 10 people were killed and 62 injured in shootings in Chicago - a drop over last year's total. Semi-automatic rifles, seen here, have been used in several of the country's worst recent shooting sprees This attack comes just weeks after the US Congress passed its first gun control law since 1994. The bipartisan bill came after mass shootings in Buffalo, New York and Uvalde in Texas triggered lawmakers to finally act. The new law contains several provisions, including allowing the FBI to access juvenile and health records from younger gun buyers aged 18 to 20. The law does not include a provision that gun control campaigners hoped for - raising the age to buy a semi-automatic rifle to 21. Many of the most deadly mass shootings in recent history have occurred using semi-automatic rifles. But the new law comes as the Supreme Court tears down a New York state law that required people to prove a special need in order to carry a gun in public. Their ruling said that all Americans have the right under the Constitution to carry a gun outside their home. State bans on assault rifles are also expected to fall in light of the latest Supreme Court ruling. Here's a quick recap of the developments in the investigation into the Highland Park mass shooting: Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot tells reporters she has been in
""constant contact"" with Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering. The two mayors have known each other for three decades,
Lightfoot said, after meeting in law school. ""The minute I understood what had happened I reached out to
her [Rotering] and offered anything that I could do,"" Lightfoot says.
""Unfortunately I have a lot of experience here."" Lightfoot says she offered the support of the Chicago Police
Department, who ""sprang into action"". ""Whatever you need, we will be here for you,"" she
says.  President Joe Biden has ordered the American flag be lowered to half mast at the White House and other government buildings after Monday's shooting. ""As a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of gun violence perpetrated on our Independence Day, July 4, 2022, in Highland Park, Illinois, by the authority vested in me as President of the United States by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby order that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff,"" the president proclamation says. The flags will fly like that until 9 July. Biden made a similar proclamation just weeks ago, after the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas. What else did we learn during the Chicago police press conference about Monday's Highland Park attack? Officials said Robert E Crimo was dressed as a woman during the attack to hide his facial tattoos and help him escape in the crowd. The authorities also said they aimed to reveal charges against the suspect on Tuesday afternoon US time. Crime task force spokesman Chris Covelli says at this point authorities have not been able to identify any clear motive for the attack. Asked by reporters about the gunman's weapons, Covelli says Crimo used at least two rifles and pistols. All weapons examined were purchased lawfully by Crimo. Covelli adds that shooting appears to be completely random and there are no reasons to believe the attack was motivated by religion or race. We've been hearing more from the spokesman for the Lake County Major Crime Task Force, Christopher Covelli. He says Crimo used his mother's car to escape the scene and blended in with the community because he concealed his identity by wearing women's clothing. Covelli adds that a second rifle was located inside Crimo's mother's car. He adds that Crimo remains in custody, and there are no indications he was acting with anyone else. Highland Park's authorities are delivering a news conference about the Fourth of July parade shooting, where six people were killed. Police say Robert E Crimo, 21, planned this attack for several weeks. Christopher Covelli, spokesman for Lake County Major Crime Task Force, says significant amount of information have been obtained from cell phone recordings and other footage. Crimo was dressed in women's clothing to conceal his identity, Covelli says. More than 70 rounds were fired from a legally purchased rifle, Covelli adds. We've heard from US President Joe Biden in the aftermath of the shootings and from the state's governor. Now its the turn of Illinois' lieutenant governor Juliana Stratton who says in atweet,external: ""Enough is enough."" Stratton echoed the governor's statement when he said gun violence was ""our uniquely American plague"". She added: ""I'm angry too. We all should be."" Highland Park's Independence Day shooting killed six people, and left at least three dozen others injured. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot is speaking out about the ""horrible tragedy"" in Highland Park. Lightfoot appears with other Illinois lawmakers to discuss a bipartisan bill meant to address gun violence. ""The gun violence epidemic is deep and pervasive,"" she says. ""We saw that play out again in Highland Park yesterday."" Lightfoot says she has been in ""constant contact"" with Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering. Gun violence is not just a Chicago problem, Lightfoot says. ""Gun violence knows no
borders or boundaries."" The bill, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, is meant to reduce gun violence nationwide. It includes enhanced background checks, a $250m (Â£205m) investment in community violence intervention and $100m for the national background check system. This video can not be played People, who had set up deck chairs in the street to watch the annual Independence Day parade, ran for safety as multiple shots rang out shortly after 1000 local time in Highland Park on 4 July. Toddlers in pushchairs, babes in arms, teenagers and the elderly fled the scene - and the gunfire - in fear for their lives and the lives of their loved ones. ""He started shooting again, and we ran behind the building and I put my son in a dumpster,"" recalled one bystander. ""It was just horrible."" Nomia IqbalReporting from Highland Park Illinois Senator Dick Durbin is here to view the remnants of the
Fourth of July parade. The Democrat looks shaken and tells me he is heart-broken
at what's happened. ""Are mass shootings now a tradition in America?"" I ask
him. ""I donât want
it to be but itâs becoming one,"" he sighs He backed recent major gun legislation aimed at addressing US gun
violence. He tells me it was an ""improvement"" but didnât go as far as
it should have. Senator Durbin says we have yet to see whether those new laws
would have stopped the gunman here. Illinois has tough gun laws but overall gun crime is high here. Republicans often point to Chicago as an example of a place
where gun control doesn't work. But some context - a report
in recent years from the city's police department has found a lot of guns come
from outside of Chicago and from neighbouring states like Kentucky and
Tennessee where the gun laws are more lax. The state of Illinois has the sixth strictest gun laws in the US,according to gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety,external. It also has the ninth lowest rate of gun ownership, according to the group. The state has universal background checks and requires firearms to be safely stored - but it does not ban assault weapons. Nancy Rotering, Highland Park's mayor, has told CNN the alleged shooter obtained his weapon legally. She criticised current gun laws, which enable individuals to lawfully purchase weapons. Rotering said: ""That being said, again, if you can have a weekly mass shooting with a legally purchased gun, then I think we need to talk about why those laws aren't protecting the very people that they're supposed to be protecting."" US President Joe Biden signed into law a landmark gun control bill in June, which aims to impose tougher checks on young buyers and encourage states to remove guns from people considered a threat. Robert Crimo, the alleged Independence Day shooter, has not yet been charged. But Rotering said she expects him to be charged today. So far, police have identified him as a ""person of interest"". Nomia IqbalReporting from Highland Park Ken Pell is picking up his granddaughters' scooters. His wife
and family were at the parade and dumped everything for safety. ""I wasn't here, I was at a nearby golf club and got
notification of a shooting. We were then put into a basement for safety. I
couldnât get a signal and I was so panicked as I couldnât get hold of my family
for ages."" His daughter told him to leave the scooters because taking them
back ""would be bad karma"". ""I couldn't do that I wanted to collect them. My grandkids
donât seem too affected at the moment but you know my daughter is not doing
well. She is questioning raising her kids in a place like this."" The motivations of the gunman are unknown. Ken is Jewish and
says this is a predominantly Jewish area so he is worried that's why it may
have been targeted. ""We just never thought we would be hit like this but I
guess neither did Uvalde [the site of a mass school shooting]."" What does the data tell us about gun culture in the US and its impact? Here are some key charts. How many guns are there in the US? While calculating the number of guns in private hands around the world is difficult, figures from the Small Arms Survey - a Swiss-based leading research project - estimate that there were 390 million guns in circulation in 2018. The US ratio of 120.5 firearms per 100 residents, up from 88 per 100 in 2011, far surpasses that of other countries around the world. How do US gun killings compare with other countries?  Nearly 53 people are killed each day by a firearm in the US, according to the official data from 2020. The data also shows that the vast majority of murders, 79%, were carried out with guns. That's a significantly larger proportion of homicides than is the case in Canada, Australia, England and Wales, and many other countries Who supports gun control?  Despite widespread and vocal public outrage - often in the wake of gun violence - American support for stricter gun laws in 2020 fell to the lowest level since 2014,according to polling by Gallup,external. Only 52% of Americans surveyed said they wanted stricter gun laws, while 35% said they should remain the same. The issue is also one that is hyper-partisan - the Gallup study noted that Democrats are nearly unanimous in their support for stricter gun laws. Only 24% Republicans agreed with the same statement. See more key data and charts here The Independence Day parade in Highland Park, Illinois, was scheduled to include floats, marching bands, and community entertainment as part of the city's Fourth of July celebrations. But around 10:15 local time (15:15 GMT) - just a few minutes after the parade had begun - a gunman who had climbed on to a roof near the parade route began shooting randomly at spectators using a high-powered rifle. What should have been one of the happiest days of the year quickly turned to panic, with pushchairs, purses and lawn chairs left discarded on the street as crowds fled from the scene. Some witnesses said they thought the sound of gunfire was fireworks. Police later recovered ""evidence of a firearm"" from the rooftop of a shop near to the parade route Five adults were killed at the scene, as well as a further victim who the local coroner said died in a nearby hospital. At least three dozen others were injured. At least eight victims remain in hospitals across Chicagoland (the Chicago metropolitan area) following yesterday's shooting, Jim
Anthony, spokesman for the North Shore University hospital group says. He did not provide updates on the patients' conditions. Thirty-eight patients were initially admitted for treatment after the parade, Anthony said, at three of the group's hospitals: Evanston Hospital, Glenbrook Hospital and Highland Park Hospital. ""We were able to mobilise quickly,"" Anthony said. ""Our physicians and nurses and medical support
staff train for situations like this, not that we ever want to see them in real
life."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Second homes limit to be set by Welsh councilsCouncils in Wales may control the number of holiday lets and second homes in their area.Wales,"Gwynedd has the highest number of second homes in Wales Councils will be able to control numbers of second homes and holiday lets under new Welsh government plans. A new licensing scheme for people who want to operate short-term holiday lets, such as Airbnb, is also planned. First Minister Mark Drakeford and Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price made the announcement as made as part of their co-operation agreement. Local authorities have already been given thepower to increase council tax on second homesby 300% from next year. Business owners have previously said theyfear running holiday-lets will become impossible. There were 23,974 registered second homes in Wales at the beginning of 2022. What's Wales' problem with second homes? Are second home owners selling up in Wales? Rappers vent frustration over seaside second homes The changes to planning regulations are expected to be made by the end of the summer and will introduce three new classes of property in the planning system: a primary home, second home and short-term holiday accommodation. Local authorities will then be able to make amendments to the planning system, ""where they have evidence"", to require planning permission for change of use from one class to another. Under the new system, councils will also have the power to set a ceiling on numbers. Mr Drakeford, speaking at a joint press conference, said while tourism was ""vital"" to the Welsh economy, having too many holiday properties and second homes, which can lie empty for much of the year, damaged communities and priced people out of local housing markets. Mr Price added there had been an ""exponential growth"" in holiday lets and said the licensing scheme would help control the housing system and ""level the playing field"" for tourism accommodation providers. This video can not be played The Home Owners of Wales group said it was âfinancially ableâ to take on the Welsh government Work will also begin on allowing councils to apply increased Land Transaction Tax (LTT) on the purchase of second homes and holiday lets. Conservative local government spokesman Sam Rowlands, said: ""I welcome increased responsibilities and opportunities for local authorities to support their communities, but I do worry this is just a top-down diktat from Labour and Plaid Cymru in Cardiff Bay. ""Many councils, particularly those in north Wales and rural areas, have been underfunded for many years by the Labour government and struggle to fulfil their essential obligations."" As part of an effort to help people, especially first-time buyers, onto the property ladder, Mr Drakeford said the government was ""investigating the possibility"" of reintroducing local authority mortgages. He added: ""In this cost of living crisis, backing from a local authority would help people access mortgages with a smaller deposit."" The move could be opposed by property owners who have previously criticised having to pay four times their current level of council tax from next April. Paul Martin worried how businesses like his would be affected Paul Martin, runs bed and breakfast The Forest, in Newtown, Powys, which specialises in catering for autistic children. He said the Welsh government had not sufficiently defined what a second home was and worried the legislation would affect businesses like his. There was not enough time, he said, for businesses to prepare for changes. ""A property used occasionally for holidays by its owner, who lives a distance away, is a second home and that is the target of the legislation,"" said Mr Martin. ""But what about a self-contained annex to the primary home? Or a multi-property complex like mine? What about a business which has other revenue sources such as a golf course or yoga centre? What about properties in less popular locations."" The Home Owners of Wales Group described the rise as ""morally indefensible"".

LiveLiveSix killed in US 4 July parade shooting5 minutes ago,"Police have been giving updates on a man held after a mass shooting at an Independence Day parade in Highland Park, Illinois They say Robert E Crimo III, 21, who is in custody, planned the shooting for several weeks and wore women's clothing to blend into the crowd He purchased his two rifles legally and fired more than 70 rounds, Chris Covelli, crime task force spokesman says The shooting appears to be completely random with no religion or race motives, he adds Two victims have been identified; The family of Nicolas Toledo, from Mexico, paid tribute to a ""loving, adventurous"" man Jacki Sundheim was described as a ""beloved"" staff member by her local synagogue They were among six people killed and more than three dozen injured It was devastating that a celebration of the US was ripped apart by a ""uniquely American plague"", Illinois governor J.B. Pritzker said US President Biden expressed shock and said he would not give up fighting the gun violence âepidemicâ Highland Park sits north of Chicago on the shores of Lake Michigan Edited by Claire Heald We're closing our live coverage of the shooting at an Independence Day parade in Highland Park near Chicago. Here are the latest developments:  For the latest updates, read our story here. Our live coverage was provided by Holly Honderich, Max Matza in the US and Alexandra Fouche and Malu Cursino in London. The debate over gun laws arises frequently in the wake of high-profile mass shootings in the US. Tuesday is the 186th day of the year, and the US has already seen 317 mass shootings in 2022. On average, they occur more than 11 times per week, according to the Gun Violence Archive organisation. A mass shooting is defined by the research group as an event in which four or more people are shot or killed, excluding the attacker. The killings in Highland Park have been the most widely-covered attack over the Independence Day weekend, but it is far from the only instance of recent fatal gun crime, which tends to rise in frequency during summer's hotter months. Also on Monday, two police officers were shot at a concert in Philadelphia, triggering panic among people who were there to watch fireworks. In Minneapolis, eight people were shot during an unofficial fireworks celebration. And in Gary, Indiana, three people were killed and seven wounded at a shooting at a holiday party in a residential neighbourhood. Less than 30 miles from Highland Park, 10 people were killed and 62 injured in shootings in Chicago - a drop over last year's total. Semi-automatic rifles, seen here, have been used in several of the country's worst recent shooting sprees This attack comes just weeks after the US Congress passed its first gun control law since 1994. The bipartisan bill came after mass shootings in Buffalo, New York and Uvalde in Texas triggered lawmakers to finally act. The new law contains several provisions, including allowing the FBI to access juvenile and health records from younger gun buyers aged 18 to 20. The law does not include a provision that gun control campaigners hoped for - raising the age to buy a semi-automatic rifle to 21. Many of the most deadly mass shootings in recent history have occurred using semi-automatic rifles. But the new law comes as the Supreme Court tears down a New York state law that required people to prove a special need in order to carry a gun in public. Their ruling said that all Americans have the right under the Constitution to carry a gun outside their home. State bans on assault rifles are also expected to fall in light of the latest Supreme Court ruling. Here's a quick recap of the developments in the investigation into the Highland Park mass shooting: Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot tells reporters she has been in
""constant contact"" with Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering. The two mayors have known each other for three decades,
Lightfoot said, after meeting in law school. ""The minute I understood what had happened I reached out to
her [Rotering] and offered anything that I could do,"" Lightfoot says.
""Unfortunately I have a lot of experience here."" Lightfoot says she offered the support of the Chicago Police
Department, who ""sprang into action"". ""Whatever you need, we will be here for you,"" she
says.  President Joe Biden has ordered the American flag be lowered to half mast at the White House and other government buildings after Monday's shooting. ""As a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of gun violence perpetrated on our Independence Day, July 4, 2022, in Highland Park, Illinois, by the authority vested in me as President of the United States by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby order that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff,"" the president proclamation says.

Cinemas ban teens in suits after Minions mayhemYoung people following the #gentleminions TikTok trend are accused of disturbing others.UK,"In the five years since the minions' last movie appearance, fans have grown older and - sometimes - rowdier Some cinemas have banned young people wearing suits from screenings of Minions: The Rise of Gru over rowdy behaviour fuelled by a TikTok trend. Teenagers following the #gentleminions trend have been accused of making noise and throwing things during screenings. A staff member at one venue told the BBC they wanted to ensure the experience was not spoiled for younger children on their first cinema trip. Some cinemas said they have had to give huge numbers of refunds. Videos showing young people dressing up in suits to watch the movie in large groups and cheering loudly during the screening have gone viral on TikTok, racking up millions of views in some cases. The teenagers filmed themselves copying the characteristic steepled fingers of the movie's supervillain Felonious Gru and celebrated that ""the five year wait is over"" - referring to the time since the franchise's last instalment, Despicable Me 3.

But cinemas have been less appreciative, with several complaining about the behaviour of the young fans drawn to the movie by TikTok. Guernsey's only cinema had to cancel further screenings of the movie, blaming ""stunningly bad behaviour"", including vandalism, throwing objects and abusing staff. Mallard Cinema manager Daniel Phillips-Smith said: ""It's been absolutely heartbreaking. We've had families who won't even go back into the screen when we've tried to sort it out, families leaving before the film has even started, and of course the children have been in tears."" The cinema had suffered a ""massive"" financial impact from all the refunds for customers' whose viewing of the film had been disturbed, he said. The Regal Cinema in Wadebridge, Cornwall, posted a notice saying it wouldno longer admit ""unaccompanied children wearing suits"",externalto screenings of the movie. Box office staff told the BBC young people in suits had been ""cheering, clapping, whooping"" and rising to their feet throughout the film. Allow Twitter content?

But some cinemagoers praised the behaviour of the #gentleminions at their screenings. Stace Woods, a teaching assistant from Surrey, said on social media that a group in suits when she saw the film were ""so much fun"" and ""so well-behaved"", adding they politely stopped bowing down and worshipping a giant poster of Gru so her children could pose for a photo with it. One parent told the Mansfield Chad the ban on young people in suits had extended to two boys in his 13-year-old son's group, who weremerely wearing white shirts with collars,external. They were reportedly turned away from their pre-booked screening until parents could drive down with a couple of jumpers to cover the offending items of smart clothing. A spokesperson for the Odeon said: ""Due to a small number of incidents in our cinemas over the weekend we have had to restrict access in some circumstances."" The Vue cinema chain said it was still welcoming all customers to see the film, which had been ""incredibly popular"" over the opening weekend. The Minions movie franchise, which began with 2010's Despicable Me, follows reformed supervillain Gru and his army of small, yellow henchmen, who quickly became the subject of endless online memes.

"No case for UK returning to EU, Labour leader saysThe Labour leader rules out a return to the EU, and is due to set out his plan to ""make Brexit work"".","This video can not be played Keir Starmer: We're not trading on divisions The UK ""will not go back into the EU"" under a Labour government, Sir Keir Starmer has said, in a speech attacking the government's record on Brexit. The Labour leader vowed to ""move on arguments of the past"" and seek to ""make Brexit work"". He said the UK was ""stuck"" and needed a plan to get its ""economy growing again"". And he recommitted to keeping the UK out of the EU single market, customs union and free movement rules. Speaking to the BBC's political editor Chris Mason before the speech, Sir Keir said: ""We want to go forward, not backwards. And therefore this is not about rejoining the EU. ""It's very clear that what we can't do is reopen all those arguments, all those divisions that caused so much anguish over past years."" He said the economy was stagnant under the Conservative government and its Brexit deal was ""holding us back"". Labour's plan, he said, would focus on ""unblocking"" the government's Brexit deal by removing barriers to trade with the EU and taking steps to resolve border issues in Northern Ireland. NI Protocol can be fixed by hard work, says Starmer Why could parts of the Brexit deal be ditched? Starmer should fight election on Brexit - Benn The Labour leader's address marked an attempt to regain control over an issue that has been a dividing line between the party's MPs, members, and some of its voters. Sir Keir - who as Jeremy Corbyn's shadow Brexit secretary said the party should advocate staying in the EU in any second referendum - has largely avoided talking about Brexit during his time as leader. Before Monday, he had not made a set-piece speech on the issue since the UK cut legal ties with the EU, and mentioned it just five times in a11,500 word essayahead of Labour's annual conference last year. With official forecasterscontinuing to sayBrexit has damaged the UK's economy, he has faced pressure within Labour - including from London mayor Sadiq Khan - to push for Britain to rejoin the bloc's single market. On Monday Mr Khan told the BBC he disagreed with the party's position on Brexit and said the ""country's future is best served being members of the single market"". Others in the party have expressed similar sentiments, including shadow minister Anna McMorrin, who recentlytold a private meeting she hoped the UK could return to the EU single marketunder a Labour government. But in a speech at pro-EU think tank the Centre for European Reform, Sir Keir rejected that approach, arguing it would be a ""recipe for more division"". He added: ""There are some who say, 'We don't need to make Brexit work. We need to reverse it'. ""I couldn't disagree more, because you cannot move forward or grow the country or deliver change or win back the trust of those who have lost faith in politics if you're constantly focused on the arguments of the past."" What Sir Keir Starmer is doing today, in black and white, is making peace with Brexit. He will say explicitly that a Labour government would not return to the single market, customs union or freedom of movement. He has said these things before - but saying them all together is quite something. Unlike the Conservatives, Labour MPs and party members were not split down the middle on Brexit. The vast majority of them absolutely hated the idea. So today, the Labour leader is saying that argument is closed and he is turning a political leaf. He will hope by doing that, criticism can't come back the other way accusing his party of secretly wanting to take the UK back in. He will also hope it creates space to criticise the Tories' Brexit deal, not least on the Northern Ireland issue. Sir Keir also repeated his promise not to re-establish the EU's free movement rules in the UK, arguing instead he would seek new flexibilities for short work trips and touring musicians. The Labour leader said new trade barriers with Europe have created a ""fatberg of red tape"" for business to follow. He likened the economic effect of Brexit to the ""wet wipe island"" blocking the river Thames in London, adding: ""It is hampering the flow of British business â we will break that barrier down."" As part of a plan to ""make Brexit work"", the Labour leader promised to: strike a new UK-wide agreement the EU on veterinary standards in a bid to cut red tape for British food exporters restore the mutual recognition of professional qualifications and rules for testing products across ""specified sectors"" negotiate a ""new security pact"" with the EU to enable the sharing of more policing data and intelligence He also promised a new approach to post-Brexit border arrangements for Northern Ireland, which have proved highly unpopular among unionists. The government argues the provisions, which it signed up to as part of the 2019 withdrawal deal, are causing economic disruption and must be changed. After failing to secure the changes it wants during talks with the EU, it recentlytabled legislationenabling it to go back on parts of the deal it doesn't like. Border checks on goods moving from Britain to Northern Ireland are opposed by many unionists In his speech, Sir Keir accused minsters of ""lashing out"" and pledged to continue talks over the arrangements, known as the Northern Ireland protocol. ""The solutions are there, the desire is there. What is lacking is trust,"" he said. ""Labour will change that. We will be the honest broker our countries need."" He also attacked the government's approach to regulating the economy outside the EU, accusing them of cutting rules and then ""gawping at the power of the market"". ""The government have missed Brexit opportunities time and time again. It beggars belief that during a cost of living crisis that they still haven't cut VAT on energy bills,"" he added. ""Labour will be sharper than this. We will use our flexibility outside of the EU to ensure British regulation is adapted to suit British needs.""

LiveLiveSix killed in US 4 July parade shootingLess than a minute ago,"Police have been giving updates on a man held after a mass shooting at an Independence Day parade in Highland Park, Illinois They say Robert E Crimo III, 21, who is in custody, planned the shooting for several weeks and wore women's clothing to blend into the crowd He purchased his two rifles legally and fired more than 70 rounds, Chris Covelli, crime task force spokesman says The shooting appears to be completely random with no religion or race motives, he adds Two victims have been identified; The family of Nicolas Toledo, from Mexico, paid tribute to a ""loving, adventurous"" man Jacki Sundheim was described as a ""beloved"" staff member by her local synagogue They were among six people killed and more than three dozen injured It was devastating that a celebration of the US was ripped apart by a ""uniquely American plague"", Illinois governor J.B. Pritzker said US President Biden expressed shock and said he would not give up fighting the gun violence âepidemicâ Highland Park sits north of Chicago on the shores of Lake Michigan Edited by Claire Heald We're closing our live coverage of the shooting at an Independence Day parade in Highland Park near Chicago. Here are the latest developments:  For the latest updates, read our story here. Our live coverage was provided by Holly Honderich, Max Matza in the US and Alexandra Fouche and Malu Cursino in London. The debate over gun laws arises frequently in the wake of high-profile mass shootings in the US. Tuesday is the 186th day of the year, and the US has already seen 317 mass shootings in 2022. On average, they occur more than 11 times per week, according to the Gun Violence Archive organisation. A mass shooting is defined by the research group as an event in which four or more people are shot or killed, excluding the attacker. The killings in Highland Park have been the most widely-covered attack over the Independence Day weekend, but it is far from the only instance of recent fatal gun crime, which tends to rise in frequency during summer's hotter months. Also on Monday, two police officers were shot at a concert in Philadelphia, triggering panic among people who were there to watch fireworks. In Minneapolis, eight people were shot during an unofficial fireworks celebration. And in Gary, Indiana, three people were killed and seven wounded at a shooting at a holiday party in a residential neighbourhood. Less than 30 miles from Highland Park, 10 people were killed and 62 injured in shootings in Chicago - a drop over last year's total. Semi-automatic rifles, seen here, have been used in several of the country's worst recent shooting sprees This attack comes just weeks after the US Congress passed its first gun control law since 1994. The bipartisan bill came after mass shootings in Buffalo, New York and Uvalde in Texas triggered lawmakers to finally act. The new law contains several provisions, including allowing the FBI to access juvenile and health records from younger gun buyers aged 18 to 20. The law does not include a provision that gun control campaigners hoped for - raising the age to buy a semi-automatic rifle to 21. Many of the most deadly mass shootings in recent history have occurred using semi-automatic rifles. But the new law comes as the Supreme Court tears down a New York state law that required people to prove a special need in order to carry a gun in public. Their ruling said that all Americans have the right under the Constitution to carry a gun outside their home. State bans on assault rifles are also expected to fall in light of the latest Supreme Court ruling. Here's a quick recap of the developments in the investigation into the Highland Park mass shooting: Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot tells reporters she has been in
""constant contact"" with Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering. The two mayors have known each other for three decades,
Lightfoot said, after meeting in law school. ""The minute I understood what had happened I reached out to
her [Rotering] and offered anything that I could do,"" Lightfoot says.
""Unfortunately I have a lot of experience here."" Lightfoot says she offered the support of the Chicago Police
Department, who ""sprang into action"". ""Whatever you need, we will be here for you,"" she
says.  President Joe Biden has ordered the American flag be lowered to half mast at the White House and other government buildings after Monday's shooting. ""As a mark of respect for the victims of the senseless acts of gun violence perpetrated on our Independence Day, July 4, 2022, in Highland Park, Illinois, by the authority vested in me as President of the United States by the Constitution and the laws of the United States of America, I hereby order that the flag of the United States shall be flown at half-staff,"" the president proclamation says. The flags will fly like that until 9 July. Biden made a similar proclamation just weeks ago, after the school shooting in Uvalde, Texas. What else did we learn during the Chicago police press conference about Monday's Highland Park attack? Officials said Robert E Crimo was dressed as a woman during the attack to hide his facial tattoos and help him escape in the crowd. The authorities also said they aimed to reveal charges against the suspect on Tuesday afternoon US time. Crime task force spokesman Chris Covelli says at this point authorities have not been able to identify any clear motive for the attack. Asked by reporters about the gunman's weapons, Covelli says Crimo used at least two rifles and pistols. All weapons examined were purchased lawfully by Crimo. Covelli adds that shooting appears to be completely random and there are no reasons to believe the attack was motivated by religion or race. We've been hearing more from the spokesman for the Lake County Major Crime Task Force, Christopher Covelli. He says Crimo used his mother's car to escape the scene and blended in with the community because he concealed his identity by wearing women's clothing. Covelli adds that a second rifle was located inside Crimo's mother's car. He adds that Crimo remains in custody, and there are no indications he was acting with anyone else. Highland Park's authorities are delivering a news conference about the Fourth of July parade shooting, where six people were killed. Police say Robert E Crimo, 21, planned this attack for several weeks. Christopher Covelli, spokesman for Lake County Major Crime Task Force, says significant amount of information have been obtained from cell phone recordings and other footage. Crimo was dressed in women's clothing to conceal his identity, Covelli says. More than 70 rounds were fired from a legally purchased rifle, Covelli adds. We've heard from US President Joe Biden in the aftermath of the shootings and from the state's governor. Now its the turn of Illinois' lieutenant governor Juliana Stratton who says in atweet,external: ""Enough is enough."" Stratton echoed the governor's statement when he said gun violence was ""our uniquely American plague"". She added: ""I'm angry too. We all should be."" Highland Park's Independence Day shooting killed six people, and left at least three dozen others injured. Chicago Mayor Lori Lightfoot is speaking out about the ""horrible tragedy"" in Highland Park. Lightfoot appears with other Illinois lawmakers to discuss a bipartisan bill meant to address gun violence. ""The gun violence epidemic is deep and pervasive,"" she says. ""We saw that play out again in Highland Park yesterday."" Lightfoot says she has been in ""constant contact"" with Highland Park Mayor Nancy Rotering. Gun violence is not just a Chicago problem, Lightfoot says. ""Gun violence knows no
borders or boundaries."" The bill, the Bipartisan Safer Communities Act, is meant to reduce gun violence nationwide. It includes enhanced background checks, a $250m (Â£205m) investment in community violence intervention and $100m for the national background check system. This video can not be played People, who had set up deck chairs in the street to watch the annual Independence Day parade, ran for safety as multiple shots rang out shortly after 1000 local time in Highland Park on 4 July. Toddlers in pushchairs, babes in arms, teenagers and the elderly fled the scene - and the gunfire - in fear for their lives and the lives of their loved ones. ""He started shooting again, and we ran behind the building and I put my son in a dumpster,"" recalled one bystander. ""It was just horrible."" Nomia IqbalReporting from Highland Park Illinois Senator Dick Durbin is here to view the remnants of the
Fourth of July parade. The Democrat looks shaken and tells me he is heart-broken
at what's happened. ""Are mass shootings now a tradition in America?"" I ask
him. ""I donât want
it to be but itâs becoming one,"" he sighs He backed recent major gun legislation aimed at addressing US gun
violence. He tells me it was an ""improvement"" but didnât go as far as
it should have. Senator Durbin says we have yet to see whether those new laws
would have stopped the gunman here. Illinois has tough gun laws but overall gun crime is high here. Republicans often point to Chicago as an example of a place
where gun control doesn't work. But some context - a report
in recent years from the city's police department has found a lot of guns come
from outside of Chicago and from neighbouring states like Kentucky and
Tennessee where the gun laws are more lax. The state of Illinois has the sixth strictest gun laws in the US,according to gun control advocacy group Everytown for Gun Safety,external. It also has the ninth lowest rate of gun ownership, according to the group. The state has universal background checks and requires firearms to be safely stored - but it does not ban assault weapons. Nancy Rotering, Highland Park's mayor, has told CNN the alleged shooter obtained his weapon legally. She criticised current gun laws, which enable individuals to lawfully purchase weapons. Rotering said: ""That being said, again, if you can have a weekly mass shooting with a legally purchased gun, then I think we need to talk about why those laws aren't protecting the very people that they're supposed to be protecting."" US President Joe Biden signed into law a landmark gun control bill in June, which aims to impose tougher checks on young buyers and encourage states to remove guns from people considered a threat. Robert Crimo, the alleged Independence Day shooter, has not yet been charged. But Rotering said she expects him to be charged today. So far, police have identified him as a ""person of interest"". Nomia IqbalReporting from Highland Park Ken Pell is picking up his granddaughters' scooters. His wife
and family were at the parade and dumped everything for safety. ""I wasn't here, I was at a nearby golf club and got
notification of a shooting. We were then put into a basement for safety. I
couldnât get a signal and I was so panicked as I couldnât get hold of my family
for ages."" His daughter told him to leave the scooters because taking them
back ""would be bad karma"". ""I couldn't do that I wanted to collect them. My grandkids
donât seem too affected at the moment but you know my daughter is not doing
well. She is questioning raising her kids in a place like this."" The motivations of the gunman are unknown. Ken is Jewish and
says this is a predominantly Jewish area so he is worried that's why it may
have been targeted. ""We just never thought we would be hit like this but I
guess neither did Uvalde [the site of a mass school shooting]."" What does the data tell us about gun culture in the US and its impact? Here are some key charts. How many guns are there in the US? While calculating the number of guns in private hands around the world is difficult, figures from the Small Arms Survey - a Swiss-based leading research project - estimate that there were 390 million guns in circulation in 2018. The US ratio of 120.5 firearms per 100 residents, up from 88 per 100 in 2011, far surpasses that of other countries around the world. How do US gun killings compare with other countries?  Nearly 53 people are killed each day by a firearm in the US, according to the official data from 2020. The data also shows that the vast majority of murders, 79%, were carried out with guns. That's a significantly larger proportion of homicides than is the case in Canada, Australia, England and Wales, and many other countries Who supports gun control?  Despite widespread and vocal public outrage - often in the wake of gun violence - American support for stricter gun laws in 2020 fell to the lowest level since 2014,according to polling by Gallup,external. Only 52% of Americans surveyed said they wanted stricter gun laws, while 35% said they should remain the same. The issue is also one that is hyper-partisan - the Gallup study noted that Democrats are nearly unanimous in their support for stricter gun laws. Only 24% Republicans agreed with the same statement. See more key data and charts here The Independence Day parade in Highland Park, Illinois, was scheduled to include floats, marching bands, and community entertainment as part of the city's Fourth of July celebrations. But around 10:15 local time (15:15 GMT) - just a few minutes after the parade had begun - a gunman who had climbed on to a roof near the parade route began shooting randomly at spectators using a high-powered rifle. What should have been one of the happiest days of the year quickly turned to panic, with pushchairs, purses and lawn chairs left discarded on the street as crowds fled from the scene. Some witnesses said they thought the sound of gunfire was fireworks. Police later recovered ""evidence of a firearm"" from the rooftop of a shop near to the parade route Five adults were killed at the scene, as well as a further victim who the local coroner said died in a nearby hospital. At least three dozen others were injured. At least eight victims remain in hospitals across Chicagoland (the Chicago metropolitan area) following yesterday's shooting, Jim
Anthony, spokesman for the North Shore University hospital group says. He did not provide updates on the patients' conditions. Thirty-eight patients were initially admitted for treatment after the parade, Anthony said, at three of the group's hospitals: Evanston Hospital, Glenbrook Hospital and Highland Park Hospital. ""We were able to mobilise quickly,"" Anthony said. ""Our physicians and nurses and medical support
staff train for situations like this, not that we ever want to see them in real
life."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
"Putin presses on with Ukraine war after LysychanskWith Luhansk region entirely in Russia's hands, its president orders the offensive to be continued.EuropeComments","Russian shelling has laid waste to large areas of the city Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his defence minister to continue the offensive in Ukraine after Russia captured the city of Lysychansk. Mr Putin was shown on Russian TV calling on forces on other fronts to pursue their aims according to ""previously approved plans"". The capture means that all of Luhansk region is now in Russian hands. Earlier the region's Ukrainian governor said the city was abandoned so Russians would not destroy it from a distance. Soldiers have now moved to new fortified positions, Serhiy Haidai told the BBC. Losing the city and ceding control of Luhansk to Russia was painful, he said, but added: ""This is just one battle we have lost, but not the war."" He pleaded for more weapons from the West to offset the Russian advantage. President Volodymyr Zelensky has pledged that Ukrainian forces will return to retake Lysychansk ""thanks to the increase in the supply of modern weapons"". What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine? Russia has now stepped up its bombardment of cities in the neighbouring Donetsk region, with the areas around Sloviansk and the road between Lysychansk and Bakhmut in particular being targeted, according to Ukrainian forces. Together the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk form the industrial Donbas area. Mr Putin was seen telling Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu that troops who took part in the campaign to capture Luhansk should ""rest and develop their combat capabilities"". ""Other military units, including the East group and the West group, must carry out their tasks according to previously approved plans,"" he said, expressing the hope that on those fronts they would have similar success to that in Luhansk region. Just before he launched the invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, Mr Putin recognised all of Luhansk and Donetsk as independent states. Russian proxy forces began an insurgency there in 2014 - the year Russia also annexed the Crimean peninsula. Just over a week ago, Russian troops captured Severodonetsk - which Russian bombardment has reduced to ruins. Three Ukrainian soldiers who've served in the Donbas have described the fighting there as brutal. ""Russians like to destroy a city, a village, totally. Never mind who's there - Ukrainian civilians or military,"" Mark, a volunteer fighter just back from the front line in the Luhansk region, told me. Another soldier, Nikolai, told me he'd be lying if he didn't admit it was ""terrifying"". All three soldiers agree with Ukraine pulling back when its troops are outgunned: ""It's very hard to hold ground. It's a lot of deaths. There's nothing left there now anyway. No civilians. No city. They bombed it all."" They can't give details of casualties, but talked of ""so many"". ""People we studied with, shared food with, volunteers like us. Many are gone."" And yet, they insisted they would go back to the Donbas within days to fight on. Speaking about the decision to leave Lysychansk, Mr Haidai said: ""Our military could have held the city for a long time, but Russia currently has a huge advantage in artillery and ammunition. They would have simply destroyed the city from a distance, so there was no point in staying."" Mr Haidai said troops had now moved to positions in neighbouring Donetsk, but that 10,000 people remained in the city. In other developments: Ukraine needs $750bn for a recovery plan and Russian oligarchs should contribute to the cost, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal has told a reconstruction conference in Switzerland British Foreign Minister Liz Truss has called for a new Marshall Plan to rebuild Ukraine, in reference to the huge US aid programme for Europe after World War Two Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, told the conference that Russia wants to undermine Ukraine's existence, but it can emerge from the war as a stronger and more modern country Ukraine's military said it had raised the Ukrainian flag again on Snake Island, afterRussian troops left the tiny but strategic outcropin the Black Sea last week STOLEN GRAIN:Tracking where Russia takes Ukraine's grain ANALYSIS:Why Russia couldn't hold Snake Island FACT CHECKED:Russia's claims about shopping centre attack READ MORE:Full coverage of the crisis,external Ukraine war in maps: Ukraine's counter-offensive into Russian territory Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Surprise fall in inflation boosts interest rate cut hopes Why a small drop in inflation matters to you Family unaware missing sisters had ended Aberdeen tenancy What happens if TikTok is banned?

Five dead in 4 July parade shooting near Chicago,"This video can not be played WATCH: People run for safety during a mass shooting at a US Independence Day parade Police are searching for a rooftop gunman who shot dead six people at an Independence Day parade near the US city of Chicago. The event in the city of Highland Park, Illinois, was suddenly halted shortly after 10:00 local time (15:00 GMT), when several shots were heard. Twenty-four people were taken to hospital, officials say. A suspect has been named as Robert E Crimo III, 22. Police said he is considered armed and dangerous. Police said the suspect appeared to have targeted the parade's attendees at random with a high-powered rifle. The suspected gunman opened fire at the parade at around 10:15 local time, just a few minutes after it began. The event was scheduled to include floats, marching bands, and community entertainment as part of the city's Independence Day celebrations. But what should have been one of the happiest days of the year quickly turned to panic, with pushchairs, purses and lawn chairs left discarded on the street as crowds fled from the scene. The suspect is believed to have fired at members of the public from the rooftop of a nearby shop, where police say they recovered ""evidence of a firearm."" Five adults were killed at the scene, as well as a further victim who the local coroner said died in a nearby hospital. ""On a day that we came together to celebrate community and freedom, we're instead mourning the tragic loss of life,"" said city mayor Nancy Rotering. The Fourth of July is a national holiday marking the date the American colonies declared independence from Great Britain in 1776. Onlookers abandoned their belongings as they fled the scene Witnesses at the scene described the terrifying moment they heard multiple shots fired in quick succession. Anand, who said he was less than 100m (328ft) from the shooter, told the BBC he initially thought he had heard a car backfiring before he saw others running and realised what was unfolding. It was ""the type of gun where it releases a lot of bullets in a very short amount of time. Incredibly loud. Then there's complete silence,"" he said. Gun violence is very rare in this suburban area, he added: ""I felt so safe here and this is very surreal. We're hiding in a shelter now keeping safe, there's people crying. It's not a good feeling, at all."" Another witness, Noel Hara, described how he was having breakfast at Starbucks after dropping off his son at the parade, when the chaos unfolded. ""About 30 people suddenly came rushing in screaming and we were locked into the Starbucks bathroom,"" Mr Hara told the BBC. ""Moments later, they evacuated us from the Starbucks because they thought the shooter was trying to get in the back door."" Mr Hara was eventually able to reunite with his son after following his movements on a location tracking app. Hours after the attack police are still searching for the suspect, using police dogs and drones to focus their investigation on the parade route, the downtown area and the central business district. Those living in these areas, described by police as an ""active crime scene"", were advised to continue sheltering in place. Gun violence in Chicago tends to rise over holiday weekends as the hot weather sends people outdoors. In 2021, more than 100 people were shot and 17 killed over the Fourth of July weekend in the city of Chicago. The shooting comes just a month after the deadly shootings in Uvalde, Texas and Buffalo, New York - and a week after the US Congresspassed bipartisan legislation on gun control in America.

DJ accused of sexual misconduct,"Tim Westwood in 2021 DJ Tim Westwood is facing multiple allegations of sexual misconduct by women who say he abused his position in the music industry to exploit them. The 64-year-old is accused of predatory and unwanted sexual behaviour and touching, in incidents between 1992 and 2017. The BBC and the Guardian have heard detailed accounts from seven women in a joint investigation into the former BBC Radio 1 DJ. He strenuously denies the allegations. The DJ was an early champion of hip-hop in the UK and hosted the first nationally-broadcast rap show on UK radio from 1994. The seven women who spoke to the BBC are all black, and say they met Westwood through his work. Some of them accuse the DJ of abusing his power within the music industry. The women tell their stories in aBBC Three documentary, Tim Westwood: Abuse of Power, which airs on BBC Three at 21:00 on Tuesday. Two of them, who were aspiring to work in the industry, say they agreed to come to London to meet him to discuss music. They accuse the DJ of driving them to a flat and initiating unwanted and unexpected sex. One was 19 at the time, while Westwood was 53. Another woman told the BBC she met Westwood, then in his mid-30s, when she was 17 and a member of a R&B group. She says she was subjected to unwanted oral sex after agreeing to meet him. Four further young women accuse the DJ of either touching their bottoms or breasts as they posed for photographs with him at different events where he was performing. The women, whose names have been changed to protect their identities, do not know each other. Some work in the music industry and fear repercussions - with the DJ continuing to have a prominent role in an industry long-criticised for its treatment of darker-skinned black women. Allegations about Westwood's behaviour toward young black women have circulated on social media for some time. In 2020, Westwood issued a statement to the Mail Online hitting out at the ""fabricated allegations"" and said they were false and without foundation. Now, for the first time, following our investigation, women detail their experiences. Warning: Some of the content in their stories may be distressing. When Isabel discovered Tim Westwood was DJing at her local nightclub, she spotted a chance to have her music heard by someone influential. She was 19, and had already been getting studio time - featuring on rappers' tracks as a vocalist. Isabel was young when she realised she could sing. During her strict religious upbringing in the Midlands in the early 2000s, contemporary music was banned at home, but she spent Sundays singing gospel in church. Secretly, however, she would write her own music and dream of a future as a recording artist. By 2010, when she was a university student, she was continuing to pursue a career in music. She knew a national platform like BBC Radio 1 could take her to the next level. ""[Tim Westwood] was the main gatekeeper to get to the level of exposure I needed,"" she says. This video can not be played Isabel described what happened when Tim Westwood picked her up in his car Isabel put together a mixtape of unreleased work and included her contact details inside the CD case. Her best friend together with her stepmum went to the club night with her. They managed to hand the CD to Westwood, and Isabel says the DJ - then aged 53 - called her the next day. The two arranged to meet in London. Her family and friends shared her excitement. ""We were thinking that this is a really good lead at this point,"" she says. ""He wants to act on this quickly."" Within days, she was on a train to London for an afternoon meeting. Isabel says the plan was to meet at Nike Town on Oxford Street, near BBC Radio 1's studios. She says Westwood was there waiting in a huge American-style car. Isabel assumed they were going to talk about her music over coffee or a drink - a point she wishes she had clarified. ""I don't ask where we're going. And then at this point, we start driving,"" she recalls. But she says her discomfort grew as she realised they were heading out of central London. ""This is where I'm now like 'Oh God, where are we going, what's happening?'"" She says the conversation dried up - to the point where it was almost ""menacingly silent"". She alleges at one point on the journey, the DJ tapped her arm to get her to turn and see that he had undone his trousers and had exposed his genitals. ""I've looked and I've seen and I'm like, 'Oh, no, oh no, like, oh my God. Just don't say anything. Don't look. Don't say anything.' And I'm hoping that's enough for him to justâ¦ not."" Isabel says she felt ""completely powerless"" and ""very, very scared"". She says they eventually arrived at what she believes was Westwood's flat. She remembers it being filled with lots of records. She says she was led to a room, where she refused an offer of a drink. ""He leaves the room and then he comes back completely naked,"" she alleges. ""That's when I noticed that he has got a condom and he has removed it [from the wrapper] and started putting it on."" Isabel says she recognised the condom packet. It had the DJ's face on one side - part of a campaign Westwood did with Durex. ""I remember that very vividly because I remember that was kind of when my brain also started to shut down."" Isabel describes sitting on a chair ""frozen with fear"". She says Westwood held her shoulders and turned her around. ""I knew what was going to happen at this point. So, I'm just like 'Oh my God,' And I remember being like, hunched up and like holding on to the back of the chair, like, scared. ""He almost, like, tapped me on the back of my leg as if he wanted me to move my leg, which I didn't do. And then he sort of did."" Westwood then penetrated her. She says after he finished, she quickly got dressed and sat waiting to leave. She says the DJ seemed annoyed when she asked for a lift to the station. If you have been affected by any of these issues in this story you can visitBBC Action Line. Isabel recalls going over and over the experience on what felt like a really long journey back north. ""I just remember feeling so deflated. So sad. Feeling really ashamed of myself and bad."" She says the encounter led her to drop out from her studies and music career. Isabel's stepmum told the BBC the whole family had been excited about Isabel's chance at a breakthrough. But she knew instinctively that something had happened when Isabel got home and wouldn't talk about the meeting. But she says that after she heard Isabel's account, she felt guilty for not chaperoning her - and says she cried when Isabel disclosed that her silence was, in part, over worries her family would be disappointed with her. Like others the BBC spoke to, Isabel became aware in 2020 of allegations being made by women on social media alleging misconduct by Westwood. Pamela's story echoes Isabel's. She was just 20 when she met Westwood through friends. It was 2000 and she was working with young people who wanted to break into the music industry. She says the DJ invited her to do work experience with him at BBC Radio 1. He had joined the BBC in 1994, after making a name for himself on pirate and then commercial radio. But his show mostly focused on US artists, and Pamela says the DJ told her he wanted to understand more about the UK scene and ""get a younger audience"". She says the DJ, in his 40s at the time, reassured her ""stern Jamaican"" mother on the phone that her daughter would be OK heading to London. Pamela travelled by train from the Midlands and says Westwood picked her up in a huge American-style car. She says, as they drove, he kept stroking her leg and touching her face. She kept batting his hand away. She says he wasn't concentrating on the road and was swerving so much that a police officer on a motorbike pulled up beside them and knocked on the passenger window. Pamela says Westwood apologised - and was told to keep his eyes on the road. Pamela assumed she would be staying in a hotel as part of the work experience, but says the DJ instead drove her to an apartment where she remembers ""records and trainers and oversized clothes everywhere"". She says that at one point, he began trying to kiss her neck and remove her clothing. ""I didn't give him any kind of come on. There was no flirtation,"" she says. ""If you are trying to actively touch me and I am pushing your hand away, that means I don't want to do anything with you. If you are trying to remove [an] item of my clothing, and I put it back on, that means I don't want it to be gone. If I'm showing you I'm uncomfortable, why would you just not stop doing it?"" She says she remembers thinking she couldn't get out of the situation. ""I'm in London alone with this man. Now, if I try and get out of this, who's to say how he's going to react. So I just submit to it."" Pamela says she went home as soon as she could. She describes the encounter as ""traumatic"" and ""disgusting"". The work experience Westwood offered didn't take place. We asked the BBC whether any monitoring of any work experience scheme took place but they did not provide an answer to this question. Pamela later spoke to a friend who works in the music industry about her experience. Pamela is critical of the BBC and other organisations for the ""celebrity status"" Westwood's position afforded him over the years - a position she believes he abused. ""I would describe it as an abuse of power becauseâ¦ who they're going to believe? This little girl from the Midlands, or this big, shiny star from London? He's on national radio, international."" Westwood fronted the UK version of the hit MTV show Pimp my Ride in 2005, and was also given a drive-time show on BBC Radio 1's sister station 1Xtra, which focused on contemporary black music. Tim Westwood on stage in 2007 at Radio 1's Big Weekend in Preston He is known for giving a platform to new artists, as well as getting some of the biggest rappers in the world onto his programmes - from Eminem to Cardi B. He eventually left the BBC in 2013 as part of scheduled changes. In a Freedom of Information (FOI) request, BBC News asked the BBC whether it had received any complaints against Westwood during his time in its employment. The corporation said it could ""neither confirm nor deny whether the BBC holds the requested information"". In a statement regarding our investigation, the BBC said ""it does not comment on individuals"", but added that presenters would be expected to comply with strict codes of conduct. In a statement released after publication of this story, the BBC said it was ""shocked to hear of these allegations"". In relation to the FOI request, it clarified it did not ""hold information that is helpful for this investigation"". One woman's story we heard goes back three decades. It was the early 1990s and Tamara had been talent-spotted by producers trying to put together a British R&B group. At that time, songs from American R&B girl groups like TLC and SWV were getting radio play and finding chart success. Tamara says she was manipulated into the situation with Tim Westwood Tamara spent her time in and out of studios recording music - as well as enjoying London's nightlife meeting other artists. One time when she'd seen him around, Westwood, who was then in his mid-30s, suggested they should meet up. She was 17 at the time and believed the meeting was to talk about her career. She says that, at the time, the DJ had ""absolute power"". He picked her up, and after stopping briefly at a radio station, he took her to a flat. According to her,  he started to take down her trousers and underwear. ""Then he began instantaneously to give me oral sex. There was no talking. There was no kind of communication about that. It was just before I knew it - that's what was happening."" Tamara says that at first she tried to push his head or his shoulders away but he just continued. ""And then I just realised that I'm in a position where it's already gone too far. I'm in a place, I'm already far from home. I wouldn't know how to get home from here. I was manipulated into that situation - I was led to believe one thing, when he had something else in mind."" Working in the same industry, she says their paths continued to cross. She says Westwood had sex with her several times over the next few years before she cut off the encounters. ""I think it was almost implied by him that OK, because we'd had the first encounter, I would be up for the next encounter and being young and not having the strength and courage to just say 'Look, no, I don't feel right about this because I don't feel right about it.' It just happened."" In 2021, Tamara watched the BBC's Music's Dirty Secrets documentary in 2021 and contacted the producers asking them to investigate the DJ. Now 64, Westwood continues to perform at nightclubs around the UK and internationally, hosts freestyle sessions and interviews on his popular YouTube channel and has a Saturday night show on Global's Capital Xtra. Tim Westwood at the Wireless Festival in London in 2019 Four further women have told the BBC about their experiences with the DJ as they posed for photos at events with him. Farah says she was introduced to Westwood in 2000 at an afterparty at Bristol Carnival. She says he put his hand down her top and ""grabbed"" her breast while they were gathered for a group photograph. ""I felt cold and I felt dirty. I felt humiliated - embarrassed that I'd done something wrong,"" she says. The BBC spoke to her friend who recalled Farah telling her years ago about the incident. Another woman, Claire, described meeting Westwood at a club in Ayia Napa, Cyprus in 2009. She recalls that he said ""lemme grab some ass"" as she and a friend posed for a photograph with him, before the DJ put his hand down the back of her denim shorts. She says she ""froze"" and felt ""very intimidated"" by the experience. A third told the BBC she was a huge fan of Westwood's BBC Radio 1Xtra show when she went to an event he was DJing at in Essex - also in 2009. Then aged 19, Loretta also describes feeling his hand snake down her back before he grabbed her bottom while they posed for a picture. ""I felt his hand go back up. And stopped at my neck. And do you know, in that moment I was kind of frozen."" Photos of Tim Westwood with some of the women (blurred) who have spoken out Nyla was in university when she met Westwood at a New Year's Day event in 2017, she told the BBC. She says he described her as the ""pengest girl in the rave"" during his DJ set and then later, while she and her friend recorded a Snapchat video with him, she says he put his hand up inside the back of her skirt. She says she was ""shocked"" and felt ""objectified"". She says the DJ managed to find her Snapchat contact and called her the next day to ask her to ""hang out"". She didn't meet up with him. The BBC has seen the Snapchat footage and the images the women say were taken during their encounters. Watch on BBC iPlayer None of the women the BBC spoke to have reported their interactions to the police. Some say they are speaking about their experiences in the hope it encourages others to come forward and leads to the DJ being ""held accountable"" for his behaviour. ""It makes it feel like that wasn't completely for nothing,"" Isabel says about coming forward. ""Like, I don't just have this trauma scar for no reason. There's a purpose for other people to not have to experience it."" Have you been affected by any of the issues raised? If you are able to talk to us please email:haveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

Here are the main headlines: Ukraine Recovery Conference: In other developments:  That's it from us. Today's live page was written by Sam Hancock, George Wright, Catherine Evans, James Harness, Victoria Lindrea, Alexandra FouchÃ© and Malu Cursino. Our editors were Jeremy Gahagan, Rob Corp, Heather Sharp and Claire Heald. The archbishop of Russia's Belgorod western region has called for an end to the ""bloodshed on Ukrainian soil"" -  in a rare display of public opposition to the Kremlin. His remarks - reported in the Russian media -followed a series of missile strikes on the Russian cities of Belgorod and Kursk on Ukraine's border- which Moscow has blamed on Kyiv. ""Last night, missiles from the armed forces of Ukraine hit sleeping Belgorod people in residential areas,"" the archbishop wrote, in a statement posted on the church's official website. ""Among the dead were residents of [Ukraine's] Kharkiv region who came to seek shelter from the war in peaceful Belgorod. ""We call for a special prayer for the repose of the deceased and for the recovery of the injured; for an end to the bloodshed that is taking place on Ukrainian soil, but which today has also reached our homes."" Steve RosenbergBBC Russia editor, reporting from Belgorod The site of the blast in Belgorod Developments now on the Russian side of the border with Ukraine... In her fifth floor apartment in the Russian city of Belgorod, Lidiya tells me of her narrow escape. ""At 10 past three on Sunday morning I was woken by a blinding flash and a loud explosion. I ran onto my balcony and saw a giant ball of flames heading towards the building. ""I ran inside. Suddenly all my windows shattered. ""Down below I heard shouting and crying. I could see rescuers digging people out of the rubble and carrying away the bodies."" Russia accusesUkraine of launching three missiles at Belgorod. Ukrainian officials have denied it. But whatever it was that exploded in this southern city, the emergency has completely undermined Moscow's claim that it ordered troops into Ukraine to make Russia safer. In reality, the security situation in Belgorod, and other Russian regions near the Ukrainian border, has deteriorated since the invasion. ""This is the first time something like this has happened in the city,"" Lidiya tells me. ""There was no shelling in the city of Belgorod half a year ago."" Local officials say four civilians were killed in the explosion and dozens of houses damaged. Across the border the scale of destruction has been far greater. Since the start of the Russian invasion, thousands of civilians have been killed in Ukraine and some cities have been reduced to rubble by repeated shelling. ""We need to live in peace with Ukraine. We always used to,"" Lidiya tells me. ""So many of us have relatives in Ukraine. And there are many Ukrainians living here."" Most of the people I speak to in Belgorod are not so conciliatory.

This video can not be played WATCH: PM Denys Shmyhal says Russia's oligarchs should pay the estimated $750bn rebuild costs As we've been reporting, leaders from dozens of countries and international organisations are meeting in Switzerland to discuss the future of Ukraine. In a speech to the conference, Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal says the confiscated assets of Russia and its oligarchs should be used to rebuild his country. Shmyhal says Russia should be held accountable for the destruction caused by the war. This video can not be played WATCH: Ursula von der Leyen says Ukraine can emerge from the war a stronger country Speaking at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Switzerland, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen says the Kremlin wants to undermine the existence of Ukraine. However, Ukraine can emerge from the war as a stronger and more modern country, she says. As we've been reporting this afternoon, the Ukraine Recovery Conference is under way in Lugano, Switzerland. World leaders and international organisations have been discussing how they will support Ukraine in its recovery and reconstruction, following Russia's invasion on 24 February. Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Ukraine needs $750bn for a recovery plan. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said the EU has mobilised around â¬6.2bn (Â£5.3bn) in financial support for Ukraine since the start of Russia's invasion. But, also on the agenda, are anti-corruption pledges and demands from Ukraine. Swiss President Ignazio Cassis, co-host of the conference, said: ""It is crucial that these efforts continue unwaveringly, especially in the fight against corruption, improving transparency and the independence of the judiciary, and that they are not stalled by the war."" A side event to discuss anti-corruption strategies has been organised alongside the two-day conference. This is co-hosted by the EU Anti-Corruption Initiative (EUACI), which was set up in 2017 with the aim of reducing corruption in Ukraine at the national and local level. Mathias Cormann, secretary general of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) spoke at the Ukraine Recovery Conference. He said Ukraine was working closely with the OECD in an anti-corruption initiative that aims to tackle bribery and other forms of corruption in the country. This video can not be played President Putin will find ""new targets"" if Russia is not stopped in its war against Ukraine, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson tells MPs in the House of Commons. He says the goal must be for ""our Ukrainians friends"" to win and that Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelensky must have the ""strength to finish this war"". He's been updating MPs after the Nato summit in Madrid last week. Leaders of the G7 group of rich nations are looking at the possibility of getting much-need Ukrainian grain out of the country ""in smaller quantities"" via the River Danube river, UK PM Boris Johnson also tells MPs. The World Trade Organization said a food crisis as a result of the Ukraine war could last for years without intervention. Millions of tonnes of grain are sitting in warehouses and Ukrainian ports that cannot be exported due to a combination of anti-ship mines in the Black Sea and a Russian naval blockade. Read more on that here. Johnson says the UK is not looking at breaching the Montreux Convention - an international agreement that regulates maritime traffic in the Black Sea - and there are alternative solutions that don't involve the presence of British warships. Johnson says getting grain out of Ukraine ""might involve a tougher approach, but what we are also looking at is the possibility of using the rivers, using the Danube in particular"". But, he adds, this might have to be done ""in smaller quantities"" rather than ""a giant maritime convoy"" using the Black Sea. Away from the action in Ukraine and in diplomatic moves, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been updating the MPs in the House of Commons after he spent the last week attending international summits in Africa and Europe, where the conflict in Ukraine dominated. Here's what he had to say:  Labour leader Keir Starmer replied: Sarah RainsfordEastern Europe correspondent, reporting from Kyiv (l-r) Mark, âSkifâ and Nikolai: mechanic, businessman and medic - turned soldiers Three Ukrainian soldiers whoâve served in the Donbas have described the fighting there as
brutal. They say the Russian troops they faced are far more experienced and
ruthless than those who tried to take Kyiv in the spring. âRussians like to destroy a city, a village, totally. Never mind whoâs
there - Ukrainian civilians or military,â Mark, a volunteer fighter just
back from the front line in the Luhansk region, told me. He said Russia was using its overwhelming firepower to ""wipe out"" villages in its advance, leaving the Ukrainians with little cover. Another soldier,
Nikolai, told me heâd be lying if he didnât admit it was ""terrifying"". They asked
for more support, more weapons. All three soldiers agree with Ukraine pulling back when its troops are
outgunned: âItâs very hard to hold ground. Itâs a lot of deaths. Thereâs
nothing left there now anyway. No civilians. No city. They bombed it all."" They canât give details of casualties, but talked of ""so many"". âPeople
we studied with, shared food with, volunteers like us. Many are gone.â And yet, they insisted they would go back to the Donbas within days to fight
on. âWe want payback,â said Nikolai. âAnd we want to protect our
families, our friends, from the terrible things that Russians do with our civilians.
[What happened in] Irpin, Hostemel, Bucha... we canât let it happen again.â Sophie WilliamsReporting from Kyiv Turning to the situation on the ground in that region, Serhiy Haidai, head of Luhansk regional administration, says that more than 10,000 people are left in Lysychansk in eastern Ukraine. He made the remarks during an interview with Ukrainian media. Lysychansk is the latest city to have been taken by Russian troops. Ukrainian military said that after heavy fighting, defending forces were forced to withdraw from their positions. Russian cosmonauts on the ISS held the flag of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic In March, not long after Russia invaded Ukraine, three Russian cosmonauts boarded the International Space Station wearing yellow and blue, in what many perceived as a show of support for Ukraine. They were warmly welcomed on board, hugging and greeting their  American, Russian and German fellow crew members. The Russian space agency denied the claims. ""Sometimes yellow is just yellow,"" said the Roscosmos space agency at the time. But now Denis Matveyev, Oleg Artemyev and Sergey Korsakov have been pictured celebrating Russia's
capture of the last major city in the eastern Ukrainian region of Luhansk. Many thought the team were showing solidarity with Ukraine in March, although the Russian space agency denied this The agency posted pictures of the three men smiling as they held up flags of Russia's proxies in eastern Ukraine, the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic and Donetsk People's Republic. ""This is a long-awaited day that the residents of the occupied areas of the Luhansk region had been waiting eight years for,"" Roscosmos wrote on the Telegram messaging app. ""We are convinced that July 3, 2022, will forever remain in the history of the (Luhansk People's) Republic."" As we've been reporting, leaders from dozens of countries and international organisations are meeting in Lugano, Switzerland to discuss the reconstruction of Ukraine. What's happening? It's an event that's been happening every year since 2017, usually called the Ukraine Reform Conference, but this year renamed the Ukraine Recovery Conference. It is usually an opportunity for Ukraine to show other nations the progress it is making and for international partners to express support. Why is this meeting so significant? This is the first URC since Russian's invasion in February, leaving those in attendance with the sizeable task of trying to map out Ukraine's road to recovery from a war that has left entire pockets of the country in ruins. It is not a conference where donors will be pledging money. It aims to establish the principle and priorities for a reconstruction project that is being compared in scale to the US Marshall Plan for Europe after the Second World War. What's on the agenda? Ukraine conference is expected to work towards a ""Lugano Declaration"" and to begin to work out a road map for the reconstruction of Ukraine. Kyiv's own recovery plan will be discussed, as well as roles and  contributions of international partners. The conference website says social, economic, environmental and infrastructure recovery will all be considered, as well as reforms that are possible or necessary to implement in the current situation. What's needed for recovery? Ukraine's PM Denys Shmyal, who is in Switzerland at the summit, told attendees that his country needed $750bn for a recovery plan. It comes after more than $100bn worth of damage was caused to Ukrainian infrastructure during the fighting, he said. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv It seems
almost certain that Russia will push on to try and take the rest of the Donbas region,
especially the cities of Slavyansk and Kramatorsk - both of which were shelled
in recent days. Kramatorsk is said to hold particular significance to the
separatist movement, being the site of the first uprisings in 2014. Beyond that, the wider Russian strategy is not clear. Much will depend on the state of their
forces if - or when - they take the Donbas region. Putin has tacitly acknowledged this, saying: âThe units that took part in
active hostilities and achieved success and victory in the Luhansk direction
should certainly rest and increase their combat capabilities.â If they are still making rapid advances, they could continue their push to take the entire south of Ukraine, up to and maybe even including the major city of Dnipro or beyond. If, however, they are as exhausted as many analysts predict, and as Putin hinted, it is conceivable they will declare an end to the âspecial military operationâ, Russiaâs euphemistic phrase for this full scale war. They might hope a unilateral ceasefire would take some steam out of the international support for Ukraine, with some, perhaps France and Germany, pushing for peace. Ukraine would no doubt continue the fight, but without a steady stream of weaponry, it could be that the front line becomes a frozen conflict, much like it did between 2014 and 2022. That would suit Russia, keeping its neighbour in a state of turmoil and unrest. Read more here. The cargo ship is anchored about 1km from the shore, outside Karasu port in northwest Turkey Turkish officials have detained a Russian-flagged cargo ship off the Black Sea coast, which Ukraine claims is carrying stolen grain, according to Reuters. ""Upon request, the ship named Zhibek Zholy was halted off [the port of]

Karasu,"" the news agency quoted a senior Turkish official as saying on Monday. Allegations of stolen Ukrainian grain were ""being investigated thoroughly"", the official said, with Russia, the United Nations and third parties involved in talks. An official at Ukraine's Foreign Ministry, citing the nation's maritime administration, told Reuters the ship was carrying the first consignment of 4,500 tonnes of grain from Berdyansk, a Russian-occupied port in south Ukraine. A decision regarding the cargo would be made following a meeting of investigators on Monday, said Vasyl Bodnar, Ukraine's ambassador to Turkey, on national TV - adding that Ukraine was hoping for the confiscation of the grain. Kyiv has accused Moscow of stealing grain from a number ofterritories seized by Russian forces since the invasionbegan in February. The Kremlin has previously denied stealing Ukrainian grain. British Foreign Minister Liz Truss has called for a new Marshall Plan - the post-World War Two US aid program for Europe - to re-build Ukraine. Truss said the new aid program needs to be driven by Ukraine itself and there should be an immediate push to support Ukrainians' return to their homeland. She said it is important to give people ""hope about the future"". Truss said the UK would be hosting next year's Ukraine Reconstruction Conference, which will include key British stakeholders. She added the UK would ""continue to lead in supporting the Ukrainian government's reconstruction and development plan"". The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has said the Kremlin's goal is the military, political and economic destruction of Ukraine. She said Russia wanted to undermine Ukraine's very existence as a state and this could not be allowed to happen. The EU will set up a reconstruction platform to co-ordinate the
rebuilding of Ukraine once the war ends, she added. The platform will be used to map investment needs,
co-ordinate action and channel resources, she told the
Ukraine Recovery Conference in Switzerland. The EU has mobilised around â¬6.2bn (Â£5.3bn) in financial support since the start of Russia's invasion, she said. ""And... more will come. We will engage substantially in the
mid- and long-term reconstruction."" Cities such as Kharkiv have been devastated by the war Ukraine needs $750bn for a recovery plan in the wake of Russia's invasion - Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Monday. Shmyhal told the Ukraine Recovery Conference, currently taking place in Switzerland, there had been over $100bn of direct damage to infrastructure from Russian aggression. The two-day conference in Lugano, which has already heard from President Zelensky, is bringing together several world leaders and NGOs with the aim of drawing up a roadmap for Ukraine's reconstruction after the war. Talks are under way in Lugano, southern Switzerland, to discuss the reconstruction of Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said rebuilding Ukraine was the ""common task of the whole democratic world"". Speaking via video link during the international conference, Zelensky said the ""reconstruction of Ukraine is the biggest contribution to the support of global peace"". Several world leaders and international organisations are attending the two-day conference. They are meeting to draw up a roadmap for Ukraine's recovery and reconstruction. Sophie WilliamsReporting from Kyiv Here in Ukraine, there are reports that Russian forces are
trying to start âadministrative activitiesâ in Severodonetsk. Oleksandr Stryuk, Ukrainian head of the Severodonetsk city military-civilian

Pret sales jump as it focuses on towns and suburbsPret A Manger's stores outside London now account for most of the sandwich chain's growth.,"Pret A Manger says it has returned to profit after a tough few years, as it shifts its focus away from London towards regional towns and suburbs. Sales at the sandwich chain rose to Â£357.8m in the six months to June - up 230% on last year when lockdowns hammered the business. About a third of Pret's UK shops are now outside London, including new sites in Brentwood, Harrogate and York. These stores account for most of its recent growth, the chain said. Like all hospitality businesses, Pret had to close its sites for long spells during the pandemic and move to a takeaway model. But the chain said it returned to profit in March, after posting bruising losses of Â£225.9m and Â£343m in 2021 and 2020. Pret flooded with complaints over drinks deal Pret ups pay to Â£10 an hour for thousands of staff Pret raises coffee subscription price to Â£25 Since September last year the firm has opened 27 new shops across the country, mainly outside of central London, taking its UK portfolio to 442 shops. The chain - which was founded in London in 1986 - said 36% of its UK shops were now located in regional cities and towns. Pret also said it had expanded overseas, where it has 558 shops, striking new franchise deals in India, Spain, Portugal and Canada. The chain has tried to innovate since the pandemic hit, launching a drinks subscription service which initially sparked thousands of customer complaints over the limited availability of some beverages. But Pret said the service - which allows customers to have up to five hot drinks every day - was now used over a million times a week - up from 667,000 times a week last year. The service has boosted customer loyalty, it added, with subscribers ""typically spending four times as much with Pret than non-subscribers"".

In a speech to the conference, Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal says the confiscated assets of Russia and its oligarchs should be used to rebuild his country. Shmyhal says Russia should be held accountable for the destruction caused by the war. This video can not be played WATCH: Ursula von der Leyen says Ukraine can emerge from the war a stronger country Speaking at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Switzerland, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen says the Kremlin wants to undermine the existence of Ukraine. However, Ukraine can emerge from the war as a stronger and more modern country, she says. As we've been reporting this afternoon, the Ukraine Recovery Conference is under way in Lugano, Switzerland. World leaders and international organisations have been discussing how they will support Ukraine in its recovery and reconstruction, following Russia's invasion on 24 February. Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Ukraine needs $750bn for a recovery plan. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said the EU has mobilised around â¬6.2bn (Â£5.3bn) in financial support for Ukraine since the start of Russia's invasion. But, also on the agenda, are anti-corruption pledges and demands from Ukraine. Swiss President Ignazio Cassis, co-host of the conference, said: ""It is crucial that these efforts continue unwaveringly, especially in the fight against corruption, improving transparency and the independence of the judiciary, and that they are not stalled by the war."" A side event to discuss anti-corruption strategies has been organised alongside the two-day conference. This is co-hosted by the EU Anti-Corruption Initiative (EUACI), which was set up in 2017 with the aim of reducing corruption in Ukraine at the national and local level. Mathias Cormann, secretary general of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) spoke at the Ukraine Recovery Conference. He said Ukraine was working closely with the OECD in an anti-corruption initiative that aims to tackle bribery and other forms of corruption in the country. This video can not be played President Putin will find ""new targets"" if Russia is not stopped in its war against Ukraine, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson tells MPs in the House of Commons. He says the goal must be for ""our Ukrainians friends"" to win and that Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelensky must have the ""strength to finish this war"". He's been updating MPs after the Nato summit in Madrid last week. Leaders of the G7 group of rich nations are looking at the possibility of getting much-need Ukrainian grain out of the country ""in smaller quantities"" via the River Danube river, UK PM Boris Johnson also tells MPs. The World Trade Organization said a food crisis as a result of the Ukraine war could last for years without intervention. Millions of tonnes of grain are sitting in warehouses and Ukrainian ports that cannot be exported due to a combination of anti-ship mines in the Black Sea and a Russian naval blockade. Read more on that here. Johnson says the UK is not looking at breaching the Montreux Convention - an international agreement that regulates maritime traffic in the Black Sea - and there are alternative solutions that don't involve the presence of British warships. Johnson says getting grain out of Ukraine ""might involve a tougher approach, but what we are also looking at is the possibility of using the rivers, using the Danube in particular"". But, he adds, this might have to be done ""in smaller quantities"" rather than ""a giant maritime convoy"" using the Black Sea. Away from the action in Ukraine and in diplomatic moves, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been updating the MPs in the House of Commons after he spent the last week attending international summits in Africa and Europe, where the conflict in Ukraine dominated. Here's what he had to say:  Labour leader Keir Starmer replied: Sarah RainsfordEastern Europe correspondent, reporting from Kyiv (l-r) Mark, âSkifâ and Nikolai: mechanic, businessman and medic - turned soldiers Three Ukrainian soldiers whoâve served in the Donbas have described the fighting there as
brutal. They say the Russian troops they faced are far more experienced and
ruthless than those who tried to take Kyiv in the spring. âRussians like to destroy a city, a village, totally. Never mind whoâs
there - Ukrainian civilians or military,â Mark, a volunteer fighter just
back from the front line in the Luhansk region, told me. He said Russia was using its overwhelming firepower to ""wipe out"" villages in its advance, leaving the Ukrainians with little cover. Another soldier,
Nikolai, told me heâd be lying if he didnât admit it was ""terrifying"". They asked
for more support, more weapons. All three soldiers agree with Ukraine pulling back when its troops are
outgunned: âItâs very hard to hold ground. Itâs a lot of deaths. Thereâs
nothing left there now anyway. No civilians. No city. They bombed it all."" They canât give details of casualties, but talked of ""so many"". âPeople
we studied with, shared food with, volunteers like us. Many are gone.â And yet, they insisted they would go back to the Donbas within days to fight
on. âWe want payback,â said Nikolai. âAnd we want to protect our
families, our friends, from the terrible things that Russians do with our civilians.
[What happened in] Irpin, Hostemel, Bucha... we canât let it happen again.â Sophie WilliamsReporting from Kyiv Turning to the situation on the ground in that region, Serhiy Haidai, head of Luhansk regional administration, says that more than 10,000 people are left in Lysychansk in eastern Ukraine. He made the remarks during an interview with Ukrainian media. Lysychansk is the latest city to have been taken by Russian troops. Ukrainian military said that after heavy fighting, defending forces were forced to withdraw from their positions. Russian cosmonauts on the ISS held the flag of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic In March, not long after Russia invaded Ukraine, three Russian cosmonauts boarded the International Space Station wearing yellow and blue, in what many perceived as a show of support for Ukraine. They were warmly welcomed on board, hugging and greeting their  American, Russian and German fellow crew members. The Russian space agency denied the claims. ""Sometimes yellow is just yellow,"" said the Roscosmos space agency at the time. But now Denis Matveyev, Oleg Artemyev and Sergey Korsakov have been pictured celebrating Russia's
capture of the last major city in the eastern Ukrainian region of Luhansk. Many thought the team were showing solidarity with Ukraine in March, although the Russian space agency denied this The agency posted pictures of the three men smiling as they held up flags of Russia's proxies in eastern Ukraine, the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic and Donetsk People's Republic. ""This is a long-awaited day that the residents of the occupied areas of the Luhansk region had been waiting eight years for,"" Roscosmos wrote on the Telegram messaging app. ""We are convinced that July 3, 2022, will forever remain in the history of the (Luhansk People's) Republic."" As we've been reporting, leaders from dozens of countries and international organisations are meeting in Lugano, Switzerland to discuss the reconstruction of Ukraine. What's happening? It's an event that's been happening every year since 2017, usually called the Ukraine Reform Conference, but this year renamed the Ukraine Recovery Conference. It is usually an opportunity for Ukraine to show other nations the progress it is making and for international partners to express support. Why is this meeting so significant? This is the first URC since Russian's invasion in February, leaving those in attendance with the sizeable task of trying to map out Ukraine's road to recovery from a war that has left entire pockets of the country in ruins. It is not a conference where donors will be pledging money. It aims to establish the principle and priorities for a reconstruction project that is being compared in scale to the US Marshall Plan for Europe after the Second World War. What's on the agenda? Ukraine conference is expected to work towards a ""Lugano Declaration"" and to begin to work out a road map for the reconstruction of Ukraine. Kyiv's own recovery plan will be discussed, as well as roles and  contributions of international partners. The conference website says social, economic, environmental and infrastructure recovery will all be considered, as well as reforms that are possible or necessary to implement in the current situation. What's needed for recovery? Ukraine's PM Denys Shmyal, who is in Switzerland at the summit, told attendees that his country needed $750bn for a recovery plan. It comes after more than $100bn worth of damage was caused to Ukrainian infrastructure during the fighting, he said. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv It seems
almost certain that Russia will push on to try and take the rest of the Donbas region,
especially the cities of Slavyansk and Kramatorsk - both of which were shelled
in recent days. Kramatorsk is said to hold particular significance to the
separatist movement, being the site of the first uprisings in 2014. Beyond that, the wider Russian strategy is not clear. Much will depend on the state of their
forces if - or when - they take the Donbas region. Putin has tacitly acknowledged this, saying: âThe units that took part in
active hostilities and achieved success and victory in the Luhansk direction
should certainly rest and increase their combat capabilities.â If they are still making rapid advances, they could continue their push to take the entire south of Ukraine, up to and maybe even including the major city of Dnipro or beyond. If, however, they are as exhausted as many analysts predict, and as Putin hinted, it is conceivable they will declare an end to the âspecial military operationâ, Russiaâs euphemistic phrase for this full scale war. They might hope a unilateral ceasefire would take some steam out of the international support for Ukraine, with some, perhaps France and Germany, pushing for peace. Ukraine would no doubt continue the fight, but without a steady stream of weaponry, it could be that the front line becomes a frozen conflict, much like it did between 2014 and 2022. That would suit Russia, keeping its neighbour in a state of turmoil and unrest. Read more here. The cargo ship is anchored about 1km from the shore, outside Karasu port in northwest Turkey Turkish officials have detained a Russian-flagged cargo ship off the Black Sea coast, which Ukraine claims is carrying stolen grain, according to Reuters. ""Upon request, the ship named Zhibek Zholy was halted off [the port of]

Karasu,"" the news agency quoted a senior Turkish official as saying on Monday. Allegations of stolen Ukrainian grain were ""being investigated thoroughly"", the official said, with Russia, the United Nations and third parties involved in talks. An official at Ukraine's Foreign Ministry, citing the nation's maritime administration, told Reuters the ship was carrying the first consignment of 4,500 tonnes of grain from Berdyansk, a Russian-occupied port in south Ukraine. A decision regarding the cargo would be made following a meeting of investigators on Monday, said Vasyl Bodnar, Ukraine's ambassador to Turkey, on national TV - adding that Ukraine was hoping for the confiscation of the grain. Kyiv has accused Moscow of stealing grain from a number ofterritories seized by Russian forces since the invasionbegan in February. The Kremlin has previously denied stealing Ukrainian grain. British Foreign Minister Liz Truss has called for a new Marshall Plan - the post-World War Two US aid program for Europe - to re-build Ukraine. Truss said the new aid program needs to be driven by Ukraine itself and there should be an immediate push to support Ukrainians' return to their homeland. She said it is important to give people ""hope about the future"". Truss said the UK would be hosting next year's Ukraine Reconstruction Conference, which will include key British stakeholders. She added the UK would ""continue to lead in supporting the Ukrainian government's reconstruction and development plan"". The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has said the Kremlin's goal is the military, political and economic destruction of Ukraine. She said Russia wanted to undermine Ukraine's very existence as a state and this could not be allowed to happen. The EU will set up a reconstruction platform to co-ordinate the
rebuilding of Ukraine once the war ends, she added. The platform will be used to map investment needs,
co-ordinate action and channel resources, she told the
Ukraine Recovery Conference in Switzerland. The EU has mobilised around â¬6.2bn (Â£5.3bn) in financial support since the start of Russia's invasion, she said. ""And... more will come. We will engage substantially in the
mid- and long-term reconstruction."" Cities such as Kharkiv have been devastated by the war Ukraine needs $750bn for a recovery plan in the wake of Russia's invasion - Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Monday. Shmyhal told the Ukraine Recovery Conference, currently taking place in Switzerland, there had been over $100bn of direct damage to infrastructure from Russian aggression. The two-day conference in Lugano, which has already heard from President Zelensky, is bringing together several world leaders and NGOs with the aim of drawing up a roadmap for Ukraine's reconstruction after the war. Talks are under way in Lugano, southern Switzerland, to discuss the reconstruction of Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said rebuilding Ukraine was the ""common task of the whole democratic world"". Speaking via video link during the international conference, Zelensky said the ""reconstruction of Ukraine is the biggest contribution to the support of global peace"". Several world leaders and international organisations are attending the two-day conference. They are meeting to draw up a roadmap for Ukraine's recovery and reconstruction. Sophie WilliamsReporting from Kyiv Here in Ukraine, there are reports that Russian forces are
trying to start âadministrative activitiesâ in Severodonetsk. Oleksandr Stryuk, Ukrainian head of the Severodonetsk city military-civilian
administration says a commandantâs office is being set up in order to
conduct a census of the city's population. âThey are now intensively looking for housing and communal
services specialists to at least somehow restore the cityâs infrastructure,â
Stryuk said, adding that portable generators will not be enough to get the city
back up and running. Russia took full control of the city last month. The city
was once home to some 100,000 people but most of its residents are thought to
have fled. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Five dead in 4 July parade shooting near ChicagoOfficials say 16 people were also hospitalised after gunfire disrupted an Independence Day parade.US & Canada,"This video can not be played WATCH: People run for safety during a mass shooting at a US Independence Day parade Police are searching for a rooftop gunman who shot dead six people at an Independence Day parade near the US city of Chicago. The event in the city of Highland Park, Illinois, was suddenly halted shortly after 10:00 local time (15:00 GMT), when several shots were heard. Twenty-four people were taken to hospital, officials say. A suspect has been named as Robert E Crimo III, 22. Police said he is considered armed and dangerous. Police said the suspect appeared to have targeted the parade's attendees at random with a high-powered rifle. The suspected gunman opened fire at the parade at around 10:15 local time, just a few minutes after it began. The event was scheduled to include floats, marching bands, and community entertainment as part of the city's Independence Day celebrations. But what should have been one of the happiest days of the year quickly turned to panic, with pushchairs, purses and lawn chairs left discarded on the street as crowds fled from the scene. The suspect is believed to have fired at members of the public from the rooftop of a nearby shop, where police say they recovered ""evidence of a firearm."" Five adults were killed at the scene, as well as a further victim who the local coroner said died in a nearby hospital. ""On a day that we came together to celebrate community and freedom, we're instead mourning the tragic loss of life,"" said city mayor Nancy Rotering. The Fourth of July is a national holiday marking the date the American colonies declared independence from Great Britain in 1776. Onlookers abandoned their belongings as they fled the scene Witnesses at the scene described the terrifying moment they heard multiple shots fired in quick succession. Anand, who said he was less than 100m (328ft) from the shooter, told the BBC he initially thought he had heard a car backfiring before he saw others running and realised what was unfolding. It was ""the type of gun where it releases a lot of bullets in a very short amount of time. Incredibly loud. Then there's complete silence,"" he said. Gun violence is very rare in this suburban area, he added: ""I felt so safe here and this is very surreal. We're hiding in a shelter now keeping safe, there's people crying. It's not a good feeling, at all."" Another witness, Noel Hara, described how he was having breakfast at Starbucks after dropping off his son at the parade, when the chaos unfolded. ""About 30 people suddenly came rushing in screaming and we were locked into the Starbucks bathroom,"" Mr Hara told the BBC. ""Moments later, they evacuated us from the Starbucks because they thought the shooter was trying to get in the back door."" Mr Hara was eventually able to reunite with his son after following his movements on a location tracking app. Hours after the attack police are still searching for the suspect, using police dogs and drones to focus their investigation on the parade route, the downtown area and the central business district. Those living in these areas, described by police as an ""active crime scene"", were advised to continue sheltering in place. Gun violence in Chicago tends to rise over holiday weekends as the hot weather sends people outdoors. In 2021, more than 100 people were shot and 17 killed over the Fourth of July weekend in the city of Chicago. The shooting comes just a month after the deadly shootings in Uvalde, Texas and Buffalo, New York - and a week after the US Congresspassed bipartisan legislation on gun control in America.

Millions of tonnes of grain are sitting in warehouses and Ukrainian ports that cannot be exported due to a combination of anti-ship mines in the Black Sea and a Russian naval blockade. Read more on that here. Johnson says the UK is not looking at breaching the Montreux Convention - an international agreement that regulates maritime traffic in the Black Sea - and there are alternative solutions that don't involve the presence of British warships. Johnson says getting grain out of Ukraine ""might involve a tougher approach, but what we are also looking at is the possibility of using the rivers, using the Danube in particular"". But, he adds, this might have to be done ""in smaller quantities"" rather than ""a giant maritime convoy"" using the Black Sea. Away from the action in Ukraine and in diplomatic moves, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been updating the MPs in the House of Commons after he spent the last week attending international summits in Africa and Europe, where the conflict in Ukraine dominated. Here's what he had to say:  Labour leader Keir Starmer replied: Sarah RainsfordEastern Europe correspondent, reporting from Kyiv (l-r) Mark, âSkifâ and Nikolai: mechanic, businessman and medic - turned soldiers Three Ukrainian soldiers whoâve served in the Donbas have described the fighting there as
brutal. They say the Russian troops they faced are far more experienced and
ruthless than those who tried to take Kyiv in the spring. âRussians like to destroy a city, a village, totally. Never mind whoâs
there - Ukrainian civilians or military,â Mark, a volunteer fighter just
back from the front line in the Luhansk region, told me. He said Russia was using its overwhelming firepower to ""wipe out"" villages in its advance, leaving the Ukrainians with little cover. Another soldier,
Nikolai, told me heâd be lying if he didnât admit it was ""terrifying"". They asked
for more support, more weapons. All three soldiers agree with Ukraine pulling back when its troops are
outgunned: âItâs very hard to hold ground. Itâs a lot of deaths. Thereâs
nothing left there now anyway. No civilians. No city. They bombed it all."" They canât give details of casualties, but talked of ""so many"". âPeople
we studied with, shared food with, volunteers like us. Many are gone.â And yet, they insisted they would go back to the Donbas within days to fight
on. âWe want payback,â said Nikolai. âAnd we want to protect our
families, our friends, from the terrible things that Russians do with our civilians.
[What happened in] Irpin, Hostemel, Bucha... we canât let it happen again.â Sophie WilliamsReporting from Kyiv Turning to the situation on the ground in that region, Serhiy Haidai, head of Luhansk regional administration, says that more than 10,000 people are left in Lysychansk in eastern Ukraine. He made the remarks during an interview with Ukrainian media. Lysychansk is the latest city to have been taken by Russian troops. Ukrainian military said that after heavy fighting, defending forces were forced to withdraw from their positions. Russian cosmonauts on the ISS held the flag of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic In March, not long after Russia invaded Ukraine, three Russian cosmonauts boarded the International Space Station wearing yellow and blue, in what many perceived as a show of support for Ukraine. They were warmly welcomed on board, hugging and greeting their  American, Russian and German fellow crew members. The Russian space agency denied the claims. ""Sometimes yellow is just yellow,"" said the Roscosmos space agency at the time. But now Denis Matveyev, Oleg Artemyev and Sergey Korsakov have been pictured celebrating Russia's
capture of the last major city in the eastern Ukrainian region of Luhansk. Many thought the team were showing solidarity with Ukraine in March, although the Russian space agency denied this The agency posted pictures of the three men smiling as they held up flags of Russia's proxies in eastern Ukraine, the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic and Donetsk People's Republic. ""This is a long-awaited day that the residents of the occupied areas of the Luhansk region had been waiting eight years for,"" Roscosmos wrote on the Telegram messaging app. ""We are convinced that July 3, 2022, will forever remain in the history of the (Luhansk People's) Republic."" As we've been reporting, leaders from dozens of countries and international organisations are meeting in Lugano, Switzerland to discuss the reconstruction of Ukraine. What's happening? It's an event that's been happening every year since 2017, usually called the Ukraine Reform Conference, but this year renamed the Ukraine Recovery Conference. It is usually an opportunity for Ukraine to show other nations the progress it is making and for international partners to express support. Why is this meeting so significant? This is the first URC since Russian's invasion in February, leaving those in attendance with the sizeable task of trying to map out Ukraine's road to recovery from a war that has left entire pockets of the country in ruins. It is not a conference where donors will be pledging money. It aims to establish the principle and priorities for a reconstruction project that is being compared in scale to the US Marshall Plan for Europe after the Second World War. What's on the agenda? Ukraine conference is expected to work towards a ""Lugano Declaration"" and to begin to work out a road map for the reconstruction of Ukraine. Kyiv's own recovery plan will be discussed, as well as roles and  contributions of international partners. The conference website says social, economic, environmental and infrastructure recovery will all be considered, as well as reforms that are possible or necessary to implement in the current situation. What's needed for recovery? Ukraine's PM Denys Shmyal, who is in Switzerland at the summit, told attendees that his country needed $750bn for a recovery plan. It comes after more than $100bn worth of damage was caused to Ukrainian infrastructure during the fighting, he said. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv It seems
almost certain that Russia will push on to try and take the rest of the Donbas region,
especially the cities of Slavyansk and Kramatorsk - both of which were shelled
in recent days. Kramatorsk is said to hold particular significance to the
separatist movement, being the site of the first uprisings in 2014. Beyond that, the wider Russian strategy is not clear. Much will depend on the state of their
forces if - or when - they take the Donbas region. Putin has tacitly acknowledged this, saying: âThe units that took part in
active hostilities and achieved success and victory in the Luhansk direction
should certainly rest and increase their combat capabilities.â If they are still making rapid advances, they could continue their push to take the entire south of Ukraine, up to and maybe even including the major city of Dnipro or beyond. If, however, they are as exhausted as many analysts predict, and as Putin hinted, it is conceivable they will declare an end to the âspecial military operationâ, Russiaâs euphemistic phrase for this full scale war. They might hope a unilateral ceasefire would take some steam out of the international support for Ukraine, with some, perhaps France and Germany, pushing for peace. Ukraine would no doubt continue the fight, but without a steady stream of weaponry, it could be that the front line becomes a frozen conflict, much like it did between 2014 and 2022. That would suit Russia, keeping its neighbour in a state of turmoil and unrest. Read more here. The cargo ship is anchored about 1km from the shore, outside Karasu port in northwest Turkey Turkish officials have detained a Russian-flagged cargo ship off the Black Sea coast, which Ukraine claims is carrying stolen grain, according to Reuters. ""Upon request, the ship named Zhibek Zholy was halted off [the port of]

Karasu,"" the news agency quoted a senior Turkish official as saying on Monday. Allegations of stolen Ukrainian grain were ""being investigated thoroughly"", the official said, with Russia, the United Nations and third parties involved in talks. An official at Ukraine's Foreign Ministry, citing the nation's maritime administration, told Reuters the ship was carrying the first consignment of 4,500 tonnes of grain from Berdyansk, a Russian-occupied port in south Ukraine. A decision regarding the cargo would be made following a meeting of investigators on Monday, said Vasyl Bodnar, Ukraine's ambassador to Turkey, on national TV - adding that Ukraine was hoping for the confiscation of the grain. Kyiv has accused Moscow of stealing grain from a number ofterritories seized by Russian forces since the invasionbegan in February. The Kremlin has previously denied stealing Ukrainian grain. British Foreign Minister Liz Truss has called for a new Marshall Plan - the post-World War Two US aid program for Europe - to re-build Ukraine. Truss said the new aid program needs to be driven by Ukraine itself and there should be an immediate push to support Ukrainians' return to their homeland. She said it is important to give people ""hope about the future"". Truss said the UK would be hosting next year's Ukraine Reconstruction Conference, which will include key British stakeholders. She added the UK would ""continue to lead in supporting the Ukrainian government's reconstruction and development plan"". The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has said the Kremlin's goal is the military, political and economic destruction of Ukraine. She said Russia wanted to undermine Ukraine's very existence as a state and this could not be allowed to happen. The EU will set up a reconstruction platform to co-ordinate the
rebuilding of Ukraine once the war ends, she added. The platform will be used to map investment needs,
co-ordinate action and channel resources, she told the
Ukraine Recovery Conference in Switzerland. The EU has mobilised around â¬6.2bn (Â£5.3bn) in financial support since the start of Russia's invasion, she said. ""And... more will come. We will engage substantially in the
mid- and long-term reconstruction."" Cities such as Kharkiv have been devastated by the war Ukraine needs $750bn for a recovery plan in the wake of Russia's invasion - Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Monday. Shmyhal told the Ukraine Recovery Conference, currently taking place in Switzerland, there had been over $100bn of direct damage to infrastructure from Russian aggression. The two-day conference in Lugano, which has already heard from President Zelensky, is bringing together several world leaders and NGOs with the aim of drawing up a roadmap for Ukraine's reconstruction after the war. Talks are under way in Lugano, southern Switzerland, to discuss the reconstruction of Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said rebuilding Ukraine was the ""common task of the whole democratic world"". Speaking via video link during the international conference, Zelensky said the ""reconstruction of Ukraine is the biggest contribution to the support of global peace"". Several world leaders and international organisations are attending the two-day conference. They are meeting to draw up a roadmap for Ukraine's recovery and reconstruction. Sophie WilliamsReporting from Kyiv Here in Ukraine, there are reports that Russian forces are
trying to start âadministrative activitiesâ in Severodonetsk. Oleksandr Stryuk, Ukrainian head of the Severodonetsk city military-civilian
administration says a commandantâs office is being set up in order to
conduct a census of the city's population. âThey are now intensively looking for housing and communal
services specialists to at least somehow restore the cityâs infrastructure,â
Stryuk said, adding that portable generators will not be enough to get the city
back up and running. Russia took full control of the city last month. The city
was once home to some 100,000 people but most of its residents are thought to
have fled. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Shooting reported at 4 July parade near Chicago,"This video can not be played WATCH: People run for safety during a mass shooting at a US Independence Day parade Police are searching for a rooftop gunman who shot dead six people at an Independence Day parade near the US city of Chicago. The event in the city of Highland Park, Illinois, was suddenly halted shortly after 10:00 local time (15:00 GMT), when several shots were heard. Twenty-four people were taken to hospital, officials say. A suspect has been named as Robert E Crimo III, 22. Police said he is considered armed and dangerous. Police said the suspect appeared to have targeted the parade's attendees at random with a high-powered rifle. The suspected gunman opened fire at the parade at around 10:15 local time, just a few minutes after it began. The event was scheduled to include floats, marching bands, and community entertainment as part of the city's Independence Day celebrations. But what should have been one of the happiest days of the year quickly turned to panic, with pushchairs, purses and lawn chairs left discarded on the street as crowds fled from the scene. The suspect is believed to have fired at members of the public from the rooftop of a nearby shop, where police say they recovered ""evidence of a firearm."" Five adults were killed at the scene, as well as a further victim who the local coroner said died in a nearby hospital. ""On a day that we came together to celebrate community and freedom, we're instead mourning the tragic loss of life,"" said city mayor Nancy Rotering. The Fourth of July is a national holiday marking the date the American colonies declared independence from Great Britain in 1776. Onlookers abandoned their belongings as they fled the scene Witnesses at the scene described the terrifying moment they heard multiple shots fired in quick succession. Anand, who said he was less than 100m (328ft) from the shooter, told the BBC he initially thought he had heard a car backfiring before he saw others running and realised what was unfolding. It was ""the type of gun where it releases a lot of bullets in a very short amount of time. Incredibly loud. Then there's complete silence,"" he said. Gun violence is very rare in this suburban area, he added: ""I felt so safe here and this is very surreal. We're hiding in a shelter now keeping safe, there's people crying. It's not a good feeling, at all."" Another witness, Noel Hara, described how he was having breakfast at Starbucks after dropping off his son at the parade, when the chaos unfolded. ""About 30 people suddenly came rushing in screaming and we were locked into the Starbucks bathroom,"" Mr Hara told the BBC. ""Moments later, they evacuated us from the Starbucks because they thought the shooter was trying to get in the back door."" Mr Hara was eventually able to reunite with his son after following his movements on a location tracking app. Hours after the attack police are still searching for the suspect, using police dogs and drones to focus their investigation on the parade route, the downtown area and the central business district. Those living in these areas, described by police as an ""active crime scene"", were advised to continue sheltering in place. Gun violence in Chicago tends to rise over holiday weekends as the hot weather sends people outdoors. In 2021, more than 100 people were shot and 17 killed over the Fourth of July weekend in the city of Chicago. The shooting comes just a month after the deadly shootings in Uvalde, Texas and Buffalo, New York - and a week after the US Congresspassed bipartisan legislation on gun control in America.

EasyJet executive quits after flight disruption,"EasyJet's chief operating officer has resigned after a series of flight cancellations and disruption at the airline in recent weeks. The airline said Peter Bellew had left ""to pursue other business opportunities"" and wished him well. It comes after thousands of EasyJet flights have been cancelled - some at short notice. Trade union Unite last month criticised a ""lack of leadership"" at the airline and urged Mr Bellew to ""take control"". Announcing Mr Bellew's resignation, EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said the airline was ""absolutely focused on delivering a safe and reliable operation this summer"". Flight cancellation plan aims to ease summer chaos He said the role of interim chief operations officer would be in the ""very capable hands of"" David Morgan ""who will provide strong leadership for the airline this summer"". Mr Morgan has been with EasyJet since 2016 and is currently director of flight operations. He had previously led overall operations at the airline, as interim chief operating officer in 2019. The aviation sector shed thousands of jobs during the pandemic, but is now struggling to meet the rebound in demand for travel. EasyJet has been one of the worst hit for cancellations in recent months. It has axed thousands of flights, including many on the day they were due to depart. Late last month it said it would be making some cancellations over the summer, to build in more resilience and in response to caps imposed by London Gatwick and Amsterdam Schiphol airports. It said this gave customers advance notice and potential to re-book. While it will have made use ofthe government's landing slot ""amnesty""as part of this plan, EasyJet said it would not be announcing any further cancellations this week. It said the last affected customers would be told on Monday. In optimistic quotes in EasyJet's late January trading update, its boss Johan Lundgren predicted ""a strong summer ahead"", with demand pushing capacity near to 2019 levels. Six months later, with Covid restrictions largely behind them, people want to go on holiday again. Demand doesn't appear to have been a problem. But ambitions have evidently had to be scaled back. Thousands of flights have had to be cancelled. Today, the airline's boss says a ""safe and reliable"" operation is the ""absolute"" focus. EasyJet is far from the only business affected by widespread issues hitting aviation at the moment - from staff shortages to industrial action. It hopes not to have to issue any further waves of cancellations, and points out it's still running up to 1,700 flights each day. However, it has undeniably been through a challenging time of late and must be hoping that a change at the top can herald a change in performance. It is understood just over 150,000 of the 160,000 EasyJet flights initially scheduled to run over July, August and September, will go ahead. This means roughly 10,000 have been cancelled - or about 6%. The airline said the majority of its flights were unaffected by the cancellations, with it continuing to operate up to 1,700 flights a day. However, unions representing EasyJet cabin crew in Spain have called a series of 24-hour strikes for July in a dispute over pay. The first of the strikes took place over the weekend, and a further six days of action are due later this month. Shares in EasyJet, which have fallen back to the lows of March 2020 at the start of the pandemic, were trading down almost 3% after news of Mr Bellew's departure - making it one of the biggest fallers on the FTSE 250 index. More cancellations from a raft of airlines are expected this week as the government has given carriers until Friday to announce changes to their schedules without facing a potential penalty. The move is an attempt to minimise disruption during the peak summer holiday season. Do you work at an airport? Do you have a summer holiday coming up? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

Major gas explosion tears through block of flats,"This video can not be played The flats partially collapsed following the blast One person has died and three others were taken to hospital after a ""major gas explosion"" and a huge fire at a block of flats in Bedford. Bedfordshire Police said further bodies could be found in the coming days after 20 flats were engulfed in flames in Redwood Grove. Eyewitnesses described hearing an explosion at about 09:30 BST. The fire service said an investigation was under way and more details would become known in the coming days. Ch Supt John Murphy said: ""Very sadly we know that at least one person has passed away in the explosion today. ""There is a possibility that there will be more fatalities discovered in the coming days as we continue to search through the scene and a number of people, as my colleague from the fire services has identified, were injured as well today."" An aerial platform was used to fight the flames Adrian Mazurkiwicz, who lives in a top floor flat in a three-storey block adjoining the one where the explosion happened, said he saw two people jump from windows to escape the blaze. He told how on hearing the explosion, he and his partner rushed to ""start knocking on people's doors to get everybody out, and then when I was outside the building I saw the walls being torn apart... and all of the windows out, and smoke and flames pretty much instantly"". ""I saw a couple of people jump out of the building and started helping them out... bringing them away from the fire, away from the danger, but it was a very, very serious and very big explosion,"" he said. Adrian Mazurkiwicz helped pull one man away from the fire after the man had jumped from his flat Mr Mazurkiwicz's flat has been destroyed in the blaze. He said he hoped his neighbours in the building were all ""OK"". ""We saw people jumping out from the flat that was directly affected,"" he said. ""I think that was the flat that blew up, and that was where the gentleman jumped out and hurt his hip really badly - we pulled him away. ""And then I saw another gentleman on the other side of the building - seems like he's just been blown out of the window by the whole explosion."" He added: ""The walls [of the building] have just been completely cracked like a walnut - there's been so much debris flying out of everywhere - ashes, smoke, dust, fire - just instantly everywhere - blazing out of the windows - and that's why people started to jump out."" This video can not be played Witness Alex Feltham said he heard ""a large boom"" at about 09:30 BST ""and the roof of the block of flats had been destroyed"" An emergency centre has been set up at The John Bunyan Centre in Bedford for evacuees and those needing support, police said. Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service said the fire was caused by a ""major gas explosion"" and urged people to keep doors and windows closed. Witness Alex Feltham said after hearing the ""boom"" the block of flats became ""a raging inferno"". A block of flats next to the three-storey block where the explosion happened was also evacuated, police said Another witness, Adam Fisher, described ""a huge explosion"". ""Everyone went to our work car park to see what was happening,"" he said. ""Our building is adjacent to the apartment complex - immediately an inferno [was] visible, huge smoke cloud billowing, people screaming and people frantically calling for emergency services."" Everybody just looked after their loved ones and other people to make sure everybody was alright, said Dezso Balazs A block of flats next to the three-storey block where the explosion happened has also been evacuated, and police said they were ""working as quickly as we can to get people back into their homes as quickly as possible"". Dezso Balazs lives in a neighbouring block of flats. ""I heard a big noise like an explosion and then I grabbed my family and we came out and we saw the next flat block on fire. Part of the building had been blasted out. Everybody started to panic and run around. ""Everybody just looked after their loved ones and other people to make sure everybody was all right."" A nearby primary school was also been evacuated. Andy George, head of Shackleton Primary School, said: ""Following the fire in the Redwood Grove area of Bedford earlier today, pupils at Shackleton Primary have been sent home due to the school's proximity to the incident. ""All children are safe and the school is working with the emergency services. The school expects to re-open tomorrow.""

Caterpillar strike ends after direct pay offer,"Caterpillar has facilities in Larne and Belfast A strike at the manufacturing company Caterpillar has ended, the company has confirmed. It comes after a pay offer was made directly to its Northern Ireland workforce after the firm failed to reach agreement with trade union Unite. In a statement on Monday, the company said the response to its offer had been ""strong and favourable"". ""We are pleased the union has cancelled its additional weeks of industrial action,"" the statement said. Members of the Unite union, employed by the firm in Larne and Belfast, have been on strike since April. Last week, Caterpillar said it wasgoing directly to the workforcebecause a 14-month process had not produced a resolution. Members of the Unite union, employed by Caterpillar in Larne and Belfast, have been on strike since April The firm has emphasised that it was not attempting to de-recognise the union. In a letter to staff it said: ""We are not walking away from our relationship with the union and remain committed to collective bargaining procedures for future terms and conditions."" Caterpillar said it was offering a 9% base salary increase effective from 1 April 2022 and a one-time lump sum equal to 2.6% of wages earned from 1 April 2021 to 1 April 2022. The package also includes an annual opportunity to cash in up to two days of leave. However, last week, George Brash, Unite regional officer, described the move as ""a direct attack on the trade union"". Meanwhile, workers at flooring company, Interface Europe, Craigavon, have ended their strike after a week. They vote overwhelmingly to accept a â15.25% pay increase. This video can not be played Workers at the flooring company in Craigavon voted overwhelmingly to accept a 15.25% pay increase. Workers had went on strike after management had rejected their 11% pay claim.

The union said the offer translated to a real-terms improvement of more than 3.5%.

LiveLiveWe need $750bn to rebuild country - Ukraine11 minutes ago,"Leaders from dozens of countries and international organisations are meeting in Switzerland to create a plan to rebuild Ukraine after the war The reconstruction effort has been likened to the US-led Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe after World War Two It will cost $750bn for Ukraine to recover and Russia's invasion has caused $100bn of direct damage to infrastructure, PM Denys Shmyhal says On the ground, Russia will try to take full control of Donbas in eastern Ukraine after seizing the key region of Luhansk, Ukraine's regional governor says Russian forces have captured the eastern city of Lysychansk, and claimed control of the wider Luhansk region President Putin has congratulated Russian troops on ""liberating"" the area; Ukraine's President Zelensky has vowed to retake Luhansk Moscow has accused Ukraine of targeting civilians in a missile strike against the Russian city of Belgorod - but Kyiv has dismissed that claim Edited by Claire Heald We're wrapping up our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for the day. Here are the main headlines: Ukraine Recovery Conference: In other developments:  That's it from us. Today's live page was written by Sam Hancock, George Wright, Catherine Evans, James Harness, Victoria Lindrea, Alexandra FouchÃ© and Malu Cursino. Our editors were Jeremy Gahagan, Rob Corp, Heather Sharp and Claire Heald. The archbishop of Russia's Belgorod western region has called for an end to the ""bloodshed on Ukrainian soil"" -  in a rare display of public opposition to the Kremlin. His remarks - reported in the Russian media -followed a series of missile strikes on the Russian cities of Belgorod and Kursk on Ukraine's border- which Moscow has blamed on Kyiv. ""Last night, missiles from the armed forces of Ukraine hit sleeping Belgorod people in residential areas,"" the archbishop wrote, in a statement posted on the church's official website. ""Among the dead were residents of [Ukraine's] Kharkiv region who came to seek shelter from the war in peaceful Belgorod. ""We call for a special prayer for the repose of the deceased and for the recovery of the injured; for an end to the bloodshed that is taking place on Ukrainian soil, but which today has also reached our homes."" Steve RosenbergBBC Russia editor, reporting from Belgorod The site of the blast in Belgorod Developments now on the Russian side of the border with Ukraine... In her fifth floor apartment in the Russian city of Belgorod, Lidiya tells me of her narrow escape. ""At 10 past three on Sunday morning I was woken by a blinding flash and a loud explosion. I ran onto my balcony and saw a giant ball of flames heading towards the building. ""I ran inside. Suddenly all my windows shattered. ""Down below I heard shouting and crying. I could see rescuers digging people out of the rubble and carrying away the bodies."" Russia accusesUkraine of launching three missiles at Belgorod. Ukrainian officials have denied it. But whatever it was that exploded in this southern city, the emergency has completely undermined Moscow's claim that it ordered troops into Ukraine to make Russia safer. In reality, the security situation in Belgorod, and other Russian regions near the Ukrainian border, has deteriorated since the invasion. ""This is the first time something like this has happened in the city,"" Lidiya tells me. ""There was no shelling in the city of Belgorod half a year ago."" Local officials say four civilians were killed in the explosion and dozens of houses damaged. Across the border the scale of destruction has been far greater. Since the start of the Russian invasion, thousands of civilians have been killed in Ukraine and some cities have been reduced to rubble by repeated shelling. ""We need to live in peace with Ukraine. We always used to,"" Lidiya tells me. ""So many of us have relatives in Ukraine. And there are many Ukrainians living here."" Most of the people I speak to in Belgorod are not so conciliatory.

This video can not be played WATCH: PM Denys Shmyhal says Russia's oligarchs should pay the estimated $750bn rebuild costs As we've been reporting, leaders from dozens of countries and international organisations are meeting in Switzerland to discuss the future of Ukraine. In a speech to the conference, Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal says the confiscated assets of Russia and its oligarchs should be used to rebuild his country. Shmyhal says Russia should be held accountable for the destruction caused by the war. This video can not be played WATCH: Ursula von der Leyen says Ukraine can emerge from the war a stronger country Speaking at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Switzerland, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen says the Kremlin wants to undermine the existence of Ukraine. However, Ukraine can emerge from the war as a stronger and more modern country, she says. As we've been reporting this afternoon, the Ukraine Recovery Conference is under way in Lugano, Switzerland. World leaders and international organisations have been discussing how they will support Ukraine in its recovery and reconstruction, following Russia's invasion on 24 February. Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Ukraine needs $750bn for a recovery plan. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said the EU has mobilised around â¬6.2bn (Â£5.3bn) in financial support for Ukraine since the start of Russia's invasion. But, also on the agenda, are anti-corruption pledges and demands from Ukraine. Swiss President Ignazio Cassis, co-host of the conference, said: ""It is crucial that these efforts continue unwaveringly, especially in the fight against corruption, improving transparency and the independence of the judiciary, and that they are not stalled by the war."" A side event to discuss anti-corruption strategies has been organised alongside the two-day conference. This is co-hosted by the EU Anti-Corruption Initiative (EUACI), which was set up in 2017 with the aim of reducing corruption in Ukraine at the national and local level. Mathias Cormann, secretary general of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) spoke at the Ukraine Recovery Conference. He said Ukraine was working closely with the OECD in an anti-corruption initiative that aims to tackle bribery and other forms of corruption in the country. This video can not be played President Putin will find ""new targets"" if Russia is not stopped in its war against Ukraine, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson tells MPs in the House of Commons. He says the goal must be for ""our Ukrainians friends"" to win and that Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelensky must have the ""strength to finish this war"". He's been updating MPs after the Nato summit in Madrid last week. Leaders of the G7 group of rich nations are looking at the possibility of getting much-need Ukrainian grain out of the country ""in smaller quantities"" via the River Danube river, UK PM Boris Johnson also tells MPs. The World Trade Organization said a food crisis as a result of the Ukraine war could last for years without intervention. Millions of tonnes of grain are sitting in warehouses and Ukrainian ports that cannot be exported due to a combination of anti-ship mines in the Black Sea and a Russian naval blockade. Read more on that here. Johnson says the UK is not looking at breaching the Montreux Convention - an international agreement that regulates maritime traffic in the Black Sea - and there are alternative solutions that don't involve the presence of British warships. Johnson says getting grain out of Ukraine ""might involve a tougher approach, but what we are also looking at is the possibility of using the rivers, using the Danube in particular"". But, he adds, this might have to be done ""in smaller quantities"" rather than ""a giant maritime convoy"" using the Black Sea. Away from the action in Ukraine and in diplomatic moves, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been updating the MPs in the House of Commons after he spent the last week attending international summits in Africa and Europe, where the conflict in Ukraine dominated. Here's what he had to say:  Labour leader Keir Starmer replied: Sarah RainsfordEastern Europe correspondent, reporting from Kyiv (l-r) Mark, âSkifâ and Nikolai: mechanic, businessman and medic - turned soldiers Three Ukrainian soldiers whoâve served in the Donbas have described the fighting there as
brutal. They say the Russian troops they faced are far more experienced and
ruthless than those who tried to take Kyiv in the spring. âRussians like to destroy a city, a village, totally. Never mind whoâs
there - Ukrainian civilians or military,â Mark, a volunteer fighter just
back from the front line in the Luhansk region, told me. He said Russia was using its overwhelming firepower to ""wipe out"" villages in its advance, leaving the Ukrainians with little cover. Another soldier,
Nikolai, told me heâd be lying if he didnât admit it was ""terrifying"". They asked
for more support, more weapons. All three soldiers agree with Ukraine pulling back when its troops are
outgunned: âItâs very hard to hold ground. Itâs a lot of deaths. Thereâs
nothing left there now anyway. No civilians. No city. They bombed it all."" They canât give details of casualties, but talked of ""so many"". âPeople
we studied with, shared food with, volunteers like us. Many are gone.â And yet, they insisted they would go back to the Donbas within days to fight
on. âWe want payback,â said Nikolai. âAnd we want to protect our
families, our friends, from the terrible things that Russians do with our civilians.
[What happened in] Irpin, Hostemel, Bucha... we canât let it happen again.â Sophie WilliamsReporting from Kyiv Turning to the situation on the ground in that region, Serhiy Haidai, head of Luhansk regional administration, says that more than 10,000 people are left in Lysychansk in eastern Ukraine. He made the remarks during an interview with Ukrainian media. Lysychansk is the latest city to have been taken by Russian troops. Ukrainian military said that after heavy fighting, defending forces were forced to withdraw from their positions. Russian cosmonauts on the ISS held the flag of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic In March, not long after Russia invaded Ukraine, three Russian cosmonauts boarded the International Space Station wearing yellow and blue, in what many perceived as a show of support for Ukraine. They were warmly welcomed on board, hugging and greeting their  American, Russian and German fellow crew members. The Russian space agency denied the claims. ""Sometimes yellow is just yellow,"" said the Roscosmos space agency at the time. But now Denis Matveyev, Oleg Artemyev and Sergey Korsakov have been pictured celebrating Russia's
capture of the last major city in the eastern Ukrainian region of Luhansk. Many thought the team were showing solidarity with Ukraine in March, although the Russian space agency denied this The agency posted pictures of the three men smiling as they held up flags of Russia's proxies in eastern Ukraine, the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic and Donetsk People's Republic. ""This is a long-awaited day that the residents of the occupied areas of the Luhansk region had been waiting eight years for,"" Roscosmos wrote on the Telegram messaging app. ""We are convinced that July 3, 2022, will forever remain in the history of the (Luhansk People's) Republic."" As we've been reporting, leaders from dozens of countries and international organisations are meeting in Lugano, Switzerland to discuss the reconstruction of Ukraine. What's happening? It's an event that's been happening every year since 2017, usually called the Ukraine Reform Conference, but this year renamed the Ukraine Recovery Conference. It is usually an opportunity for Ukraine to show other nations the progress it is making and for international partners to express support. Why is this meeting so significant? This is the first URC since Russian's invasion in February, leaving those in attendance with the sizeable task of trying to map out Ukraine's road to recovery from a war that has left entire pockets of the country in ruins. It is not a conference where donors will be pledging money. It aims to establish the principle and priorities for a reconstruction project that is being compared in scale to the US Marshall Plan for Europe after the Second World War. What's on the agenda? Ukraine conference is expected to work towards a ""Lugano Declaration"" and to begin to work out a road map for the reconstruction of Ukraine. Kyiv's own recovery plan will be discussed, as well as roles and  contributions of international partners. The conference website says social, economic, environmental and infrastructure recovery will all be considered, as well as reforms that are possible or necessary to implement in the current situation. What's needed for recovery? Ukraine's PM Denys Shmyal, who is in Switzerland at the summit, told attendees that his country needed $750bn for a recovery plan. It comes after more than $100bn worth of damage was caused to Ukrainian infrastructure during the fighting, he said. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv It seems
almost certain that Russia will push on to try and take the rest of the Donbas region,
especially the cities of Slavyansk and Kramatorsk - both of which were shelled
in recent days. Kramatorsk is said to hold particular significance to the
separatist movement, being the site of the first uprisings in 2014. Beyond that, the wider Russian strategy is not clear. Much will depend on the state of their
forces if - or when - they take the Donbas region. Putin has tacitly acknowledged this, saying: âThe units that took part in
active hostilities and achieved success and victory in the Luhansk direction
should certainly rest and increase their combat capabilities.â If they are still making rapid advances, they could continue their push to take the entire south of Ukraine, up to and maybe even including the major city of Dnipro or beyond. If, however, they are as exhausted as many analysts predict, and as Putin hinted, it is conceivable they will declare an end to the âspecial military operationâ, Russiaâs euphemistic phrase for this full scale war. They might hope a unilateral ceasefire would take some steam out of the international support for Ukraine, with some, perhaps France and Germany, pushing for peace. Ukraine would no doubt continue the fight, but without a steady stream of weaponry, it could be that the front line becomes a frozen conflict, much like it did between 2014 and 2022. That would suit Russia, keeping its neighbour in a state of turmoil and unrest. Read more here. The cargo ship is anchored about 1km from the shore, outside Karasu port in northwest Turkey Turkish officials have detained a Russian-flagged cargo ship off the Black Sea coast, which Ukraine claims is carrying stolen grain, according to Reuters. ""Upon request, the ship named Zhibek Zholy was halted off [the port of]

Karasu,"" the news agency quoted a senior Turkish official as saying on Monday. Allegations of stolen Ukrainian grain were ""being investigated thoroughly"", the official said, with Russia, the United Nations and third parties involved in talks. An official at Ukraine's Foreign Ministry, citing the nation's maritime administration, told Reuters the ship was carrying the first consignment of 4,500 tonnes of grain from Berdyansk, a Russian-occupied port in south Ukraine. A decision regarding the cargo would be made following a meeting of investigators on Monday, said Vasyl Bodnar, Ukraine's ambassador to Turkey, on national TV - adding that Ukraine was hoping for the confiscation of the grain. Kyiv has accused Moscow of stealing grain from a number ofterritories seized by Russian forces since the invasionbegan in February. The Kremlin has previously denied stealing Ukrainian grain. British Foreign Minister Liz Truss has called for a new Marshall Plan - the post-World War Two US aid program for Europe - to re-build Ukraine. Truss said the new aid program needs to be driven by Ukraine itself and there should be an immediate push to support Ukrainians' return to their homeland. She said it is important to give people ""hope about the future"". Truss said the UK would be hosting next year's Ukraine Reconstruction Conference, which will include key British stakeholders. She added the UK would ""continue to lead in supporting the Ukrainian government's reconstruction and development plan"". The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has said the Kremlin's goal is the military, political and economic destruction of Ukraine. She said Russia wanted to undermine Ukraine's very existence as a state and this could not be allowed to happen. The EU will set up a reconstruction platform to co-ordinate the
rebuilding of Ukraine once the war ends, she added. The platform will be used to map investment needs,
co-ordinate action and channel resources, she told the
Ukraine Recovery Conference in Switzerland. The EU has mobilised around â¬6.2bn (Â£5.3bn) in financial support since the start of Russia's invasion, she said. ""And... more will come. We will engage substantially in the
mid- and long-term reconstruction."" Cities such as Kharkiv have been devastated by the war Ukraine needs $750bn for a recovery plan in the wake of Russia's invasion - Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Monday. Shmyhal told the Ukraine Recovery Conference, currently taking place in Switzerland, there had been over $100bn of direct damage to infrastructure from Russian aggression. The two-day conference in Lugano, which has already heard from President Zelensky, is bringing together several world leaders and NGOs with the aim of drawing up a roadmap for Ukraine's reconstruction after the war. Talks are under way in Lugano, southern Switzerland, to discuss the reconstruction of Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said rebuilding Ukraine was the ""common task of the whole democratic world"". Speaking via video link during the international conference, Zelensky said the ""reconstruction of Ukraine is the biggest contribution to the support of global peace"". Several world leaders and international organisations are attending the two-day conference. They are meeting to draw up a roadmap for Ukraine's recovery and reconstruction. Sophie WilliamsReporting from Kyiv Here in Ukraine, there are reports that Russian forces are
trying to start âadministrative activitiesâ in Severodonetsk. Oleksandr Stryuk, Ukrainian head of the Severodonetsk city military-civilian
administration says a commandantâs office is being set up in order to
conduct a census of the city's population. âThey are now intensively looking for housing and communal
services specialists to at least somehow restore the cityâs infrastructure,â
Stryuk said, adding that portable generators will not be enough to get the city
back up and running. Russia took full control of the city last month. The city
was once home to some 100,000 people but most of its residents are thought to
have fled. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
EasyJet executive quits after flight disruptionThe move comes after the airline has been criticised for flight cancellations and disruption.,"EasyJet's chief operating officer has resigned after a series of flight cancellations and disruption at the airline in recent weeks. The airline said Peter Bellew had left ""to pursue other business opportunities"" and wished him well. It comes after thousands of EasyJet flights have been cancelled - some at short notice. Trade union Unite last month criticised a ""lack of leadership"" at the airline and urged Mr Bellew to ""take control"". Announcing Mr Bellew's resignation, EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said the airline was ""absolutely focused on delivering a safe and reliable operation this summer"". Flight cancellation plan aims to ease summer chaos He said the role of interim chief operations officer would be in the ""very capable hands of"" David Morgan ""who will provide strong leadership for the airline this summer"". Mr Morgan has been with EasyJet since 2016 and is currently director of flight operations. He had previously led overall operations at the airline, as interim chief operating officer in 2019. The aviation sector shed thousands of jobs during the pandemic, but is now struggling to meet the rebound in demand for travel. EasyJet has been one of the worst hit for cancellations in recent months. It has axed thousands of flights, including many on the day they were due to depart. Late last month it said it would be making some cancellations over the summer, to build in more resilience and in response to caps imposed by London Gatwick and Amsterdam Schiphol airports. It said this gave customers advance notice and potential to re-book. While it will have made use ofthe government's landing slot ""amnesty""as part of this plan, EasyJet said it would not be announcing any further cancellations this week. It said the last affected customers would be told on Monday. In optimistic quotes in EasyJet's late January trading update, its boss Johan Lundgren predicted ""a strong summer ahead"", with demand pushing capacity near to 2019 levels. Six months later, with Covid restrictions largely behind them, people want to go on holiday again. Demand doesn't appear to have been a problem. But ambitions have evidently had to be scaled back. Thousands of flights have had to be cancelled. Today, the airline's boss says a ""safe and reliable"" operation is the ""absolute"" focus. EasyJet is far from the only business affected by widespread issues hitting aviation at the moment - from staff shortages to industrial action. It hopes not to have to issue any further waves of cancellations, and points out it's still running up to 1,700 flights each day. However, it has undeniably been through a challenging time of late and must be hoping that a change at the top can herald a change in performance. It is understood just over 150,000 of the 160,000 EasyJet flights initially scheduled to run over July, August and September, will go ahead. This means roughly 10,000 have been cancelled - or about 6%. The airline said the majority of its flights were unaffected by the cancellations, with it continuing to operate up to 1,700 flights a day. However, unions representing EasyJet cabin crew in Spain have called a series of 24-hour strikes for July in a dispute over pay. The first of the strikes took place over the weekend, and a further six days of action are due later this month. Shares in EasyJet, which have fallen back to the lows of March 2020 at the start of the pandemic, were trading down almost 3% after news of Mr Bellew's departure - making it one of the biggest fallers on the FTSE 250 index. More cancellations from a raft of airlines are expected this week as the government has given carriers until Friday to announce changes to their schedules without facing a potential penalty. The move is an attempt to minimise disruption during the peak summer holiday season. Do you work at an airport? Do you have a summer holiday coming up? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

Major gas explosion tears through block of flatsAn eyewitness describes seeing one man jump from a flat window to escape the fire.,"This video can not be played The flats partially collapsed following the blast One person has died and three others were taken to hospital after a ""major gas explosion"" and a huge fire at a block of flats in Bedford. Bedfordshire Police said further bodies could be found in the coming days after 20 flats were engulfed in flames in Redwood Grove. Eyewitnesses described hearing an explosion at about 09:30 BST. The fire service said an investigation was under way and more details would become known in the coming days. Ch Supt John Murphy said: ""Very sadly we know that at least one person has passed away in the explosion today. ""There is a possibility that there will be more fatalities discovered in the coming days as we continue to search through the scene and a number of people, as my colleague from the fire services has identified, were injured as well today."" An aerial platform was used to fight the flames Adrian Mazurkiwicz, who lives in a top floor flat in a three-storey block adjoining the one where the explosion happened, said he saw two people jump from windows to escape the blaze. He told how on hearing the explosion, he and his partner rushed to ""start knocking on people's doors to get everybody out, and then when I was outside the building I saw the walls being torn apart... and all of the windows out, and smoke and flames pretty much instantly"". ""I saw a couple of people jump out of the building and started helping them out... bringing them away from the fire, away from the danger, but it was a very, very serious and very big explosion,"" he said. Adrian Mazurkiwicz helped pull one man away from the fire after the man had jumped from his flat Mr Mazurkiwicz's flat has been destroyed in the blaze. He said he hoped his neighbours in the building were all ""OK"". ""We saw people jumping out from the flat that was directly affected,"" he said. ""I think that was the flat that blew up, and that was where the gentleman jumped out and hurt his hip really badly - we pulled him away. ""And then I saw another gentleman on the other side of the building - seems like he's just been blown out of the window by the whole explosion."" He added: ""The walls [of the building] have just been completely cracked like a walnut - there's been so much debris flying out of everywhere - ashes, smoke, dust, fire - just instantly everywhere - blazing out of the windows - and that's why people started to jump out."" This video can not be played Witness Alex Feltham said he heard ""a large boom"" at about 09:30 BST ""and the roof of the block of flats had been destroyed"" An emergency centre has been set up at The John Bunyan Centre in Bedford for evacuees and those needing support, police said. Bedfordshire Fire and Rescue Service said the fire was caused by a ""major gas explosion"" and urged people to keep doors and windows closed. Witness Alex Feltham said after hearing the ""boom"" the block of flats became ""a raging inferno"". A block of flats next to the three-storey block where the explosion happened was also evacuated, police said Another witness, Adam Fisher, described ""a huge explosion"". ""Everyone went to our work car park to see what was happening,"" he said. ""Our building is adjacent to the apartment complex - immediately an inferno [was] visible, huge smoke cloud billowing, people screaming and people frantically calling for emergency services."" Everybody just looked after their loved ones and other people to make sure everybody was alright, said Dezso Balazs A block of flats next to the three-storey block where the explosion happened has also been evacuated, and police said they were ""working as quickly as we can to get people back into their homes as quickly as possible"". Dezso Balazs lives in a neighbouring block of flats. ""I heard a big noise like an explosion and then I grabbed my family and we came out and we saw the next flat block on fire. Part of the building had been blasted out. Everybody started to panic and run around. ""Everybody just looked after their loved ones and other people to make sure everybody was all right."" A nearby primary school was also been evacuated. Andy George, head of Shackleton Primary School, said: ""Following the fire in the Redwood Grove area of Bedford earlier today, pupils at Shackleton Primary have been sent home due to the school's proximity to the incident. ""All children are safe and the school is working with the emergency services. The school expects to re-open tomorrow.""

Barristers to strike every other week from AugustThe long-running dispute is over how much criminal barristers are paid for legal aid work.,"Barristers gathered outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London Criminal cases in courts across England and Wales face disruption for a second week as barristers pledge to extend their strike action into August. Rallies have taken outside the Royal Courts of Justice, in London, plus Liverpool and Birmingham Crown Courts. Members of the Criminal Bar Association have rejected the government's 15% pay offer, saying it will not kick in immediately or apply to existing cases. Ministers blame the strikes for worseninga backlog of 58,000 cases. But the Criminal Bar Association says long-term legal-aid cuts are the cause. The CBA is asking for a 25% rise in pay for legal aid work, representing people who could not otherwise afford lawyers. It says some junior barristers currently make less than the hourly minimum wage. Ministers say a typical criminal barrister would get Â£7,000 more a year under the offer, adding that before expenses, median earnings for criminal barristers in 2019-20 were Â£79,800, although it admits junior barristers often earn a fraction of this. Strike leaves defendants facing court delays Barristers walk out of courts over pay Criminal barristers vote to strike over pay rates The CBA's four weeks of action escalates to a three-day walk-out this week, increasing by one day a week to a five-day strike from 18 July - and from August, barristers will strike on alternate weeks. Ministers say the number of backlogged cases is coming down, due to government initiatives - but say the strikes will lead to more delays and more people waiting for justice. ""Our energetic efforts to tackle the courts backlog are working but the strike action by criminal barristers threatens all that progress, despite the very generous pay offer on the table,"" argues Justice Minister James Cartlidge. But the CBA says a 28% cut in legal aid fees over the past decade has forced barristers out of the sector, with their numbers down a quarter compared to five years ago. This video can not be played Two young lawyers share their concerns about the profession ""There are simply too few criminal justice barristers to prosecute, to defend and even to provide the judges the government relies on and the public expects to be there, to crack a record backlog and ensure victims of crime and the accused are not left in agonising limbo,"" said a CBA spokesperson. ""The criminal justice system has been grinding to a halt for a number of years, not because of us but because the government has simply mismanaged the system and underfunded it considerably,"" said CBA chairman Jo Sidhu. The CBA says its own analysis of government figures suggests that in the year to March 2022 more  than 1,000 criminal trials were postponed at the last moment because there was no prosecuting or defence barrister available. Solicitors working in the criminal justice system have told the BBC they face similar problems. ""We believe the years of underfunding have lead to a crisis in the criminal justice system,"" said Hashem Puri, president of the London Criminal Courts Solicitors Association. ""Large numbers of barristers and criminal solicitors are leaving the profession because of the low pay... ""Our members are considering taking similar action and joining the bar in days of action.""

Arrests as go-slow fuel protests cause disruption,"This video can not be played Watch: Motorways brought to a standstill by fuel price protesters More than a dozen protesters were arrested for driving too slowly during demonstrations on motorways in England, Wales and Scotland over fuel prices. The go-slow action mainly targeted three-lane motorways with convoys of vehicles crawling along two lanes - leaving the ""fast"" outside lane free. Twelve people were arrested during a protest on the M4, which led to the Prince of Wales Bridge, between England and Wales, being closed. Another man was arrested near the A38. Protesters, organised under the social media banner Fuel Price Stand Against Tax, drove in a series of convoys at 30mph (48.3km/h) to cause gridlock on major roads and motorways. Chief Superintendent Tom Harding from Gwent Police said people had been arrested for driving under 30mph for a ""prolonged amount of time"". The roads affected by disruption included: the M4 and Prince of Wales Bridge the M5 in Devon the M32 in Gloucestershire the A38 in Devon the M180 in Lincolnshire the A12 in Essex the A92 in Scotland the A64 near York Gwent Police said organisers of the protest had been given a legal notice to prevent them from blocking the bridge over the River Severn and from driving under 30mph. Ch Supt Harding said restrictions had been placed on the protest as otherwise ""emergency and critical services"" would have been restricted. Tariq Akram said other cars joined the convoy as it went by Tariq Akram said his was one of 50 vehicles making the 60-mile journey through Scunthorpe and Doncaster at 20mph. The Scunthorpe truck driver told the BBC his company had added Â£4,000 to its fuel bill in the past four months because of rising prices. ""The turnout was absolutely fantastic. There were 35 vehicles from our yard alone who took part,"" he said. ""At one point, I thought some cars wanted to overtake so I tried to let them by, then I realised they were joining in."" Police Scotland has told drivers to drive at an appropriate speed for the conditions Avon and Somerset Police said all protests in its area had finished and thanked the public for their patience in a tweet at 15:20 BST. Earlier, Devon and Cornwall Police said it was aware of a go-slow protest heading northbound from Exeter services on the M5. The force also said a further protest began on the A38 heading north from Ivybridge, where a man in his 50s was arrested after ignoring a warning about unsafe driving. ""Unfortunately we have had unsafe driving on the A38 including vehicles travelling at a dangerously low speed,"" a force spokesman said. Why is petrol so expensive in the UK? Fact vs fiction: Five tips for saving petrol money examined Steve Nash, who got stuck on the M5, said the protesters might be ""going about it the wrong way"" Steve Nash, who was delayed on the M5 by protesters as he drove to Exeter Airport to return a hire car, is hopeful the delay will not result in a penalty fee. ""I'm not sure what they're achieving - other than inconveniencing people,"" he said. ""I'm not critical of the sentiment behind what they're trying to do, I just think they're possibly going about it the wrong way."" The retired civil servant from Tiverton said his journey that would usually take 20 minutes took an hour on Monday. He said he felt the protesters should be ""stood outside parliament or writing to their MPs"". ""I think it's not affecting the people you need to actually protest, which is Parliament. The protesters have actually inconvenienced everyone else who is inconvenienced by high fuel prices."" Police Scotland said it had beenaware of protests on motorways and trunk roadsand urged motorists to drive at an appropriate speed for the road conditions. But the force had warned journey times could be longer than normal. In Lincolnshire, police blocked junction one between the M180 and M18 forcing protesters to remain on the former. West Yorkshire Police said a ""single tyre deflation device"" - also known as a ""stinger"" - had been deployed, but it was not used. West Mercia Police said some of the tactics used during a protest on the M54, which had ended by about 08:30 BST, had ""compromised the safety of other road users"" and said officers wouldtake action against those who committed traffic offences. A Facebook event called Stand Up to Fuel Prices, with more than 57,000 responses, had called for people to take their cars, lorries and tractors to cause roadblocks all over the country ""until there is change"". The organisers wrote that fuel costs were driving up other costs of living and said they hoped the more people that joined the protest, the sooner living costs would drop. Fuel prices have risen to record highs in recent weeks with figures from data firm Experian showing the average price of a litre of petrol at UK forecourts had hit 191.5p and 199.0p for diesel on Sunday. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said there did not appear to be any sign of retailers reducing forecourt prices, despite weekly wholesale costs having fallen for five weeks. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said he will carefully consider calls for a ""more substantial"" fuel duty cut after the 5p per litre reduction implemented in March failed to halt price rises. Rising fuel prices have been pushed even higher by the war in Ukraine, with Russia, one of the world's largest oil exporters, facing sanctions. A convoy of vehicles on the M180 in Lincolnshire Police escort vehicles across the Prince of Wales Bridge, which runs between England and Wales The government had said while it understands people are struggling with rising prices and have a right to protest, ""people's day-to-day lives should not be disrupted"" and warned traffic delays ""will only add to fuel use"". Howard Cox, founder of campaign group FairFuelUK, said other countries had cut fuel duty more than the UK and called for a reduction of at least 20p. While he said his organisation was not involved in the protests, he said there was an appetite for them - and if the government did not deliver on the issue there could be ""some serious escalation of protests"".

TV chef becomes first Scottish Seafood ambassador,"Monica Galetti was a judge on MasterChef: The Professionals, until earlier this year Acclaimed TV chef Monica Galetti has been named as the first Scottish Seafood Ambassador. The former MasterChef Professionals judge will lead the way in encouraging UK hospitality venues to offer more Scottish seafood. Seafood from Scotland has created the new Sea the People campaign, which Galetti will head as ambassador. She is an advocate for Scottish-sourced seafood and is calling for more fish and shellfish to be sold in the UK. In preparation for the role, Galetti travelled around Scottish costal communities to speak to people behind the industry, including fishermen, salmon farmers, fish smokers, oyster growers, processers and entrepreneurs. Galetti said: ""Sea the People is vital because, at its heart, the Scottish seafood industry depends on these men and women to maintain and grow its premium status. ""I would love to see UK restaurants and retailers stocking more Scottish fish and shellfish - fished or farmed. At present, around 80% is exported. ""We have a collective responsibility to introduce different species to consumers, in a way that encourages them to look beyond the familiar. For me, Scottish seafood is synonymous with the best quality in the world, and we definitely need to be shouting about it."" Head of trade marketing at Seafood Scotland, Adam Wing, said: ""As a chef and restaurateur, Monica is in an ideal position to encourage young chefs and buyers to take a closer look at what we can offer and to help them appreciate the effort that goes into producing such high-quality fish and shellfish. ""Scotland's fishing industry is one of the oldest in the country and many businesses have been handed down through the generations, with knowledge and skills passed on through families and communities. ""This knowledge, combined with astute investment in innovation and technology - and a bigger focus on sustainability - will ensure that Scottish seafood continues to punch above its weight in global food markets.""

Thalidomide survivors to get lifelong support,"Thalidomide was banned as a morning sickness drug in 1961 after the danger it posed to babies was discovered Thalidomide survivors living in Scotland will receive lifelong financial support, the Scottish government has announced. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said he hoped the commitment to provide grants would reassure those affected. There are 50 known survivors of the banned pregnancy drug living in Scotland, most now in their 60s. They are among thousands born with limb deformities after their mothers took thalidomide while pregnant. The drug was commonly used to treat morning sickness from 1958 to 1961. In 2013 the Scottish governmentcommitted Â£14.2m to help survivorsover a 10-year period, with the money going on health and living costs. Ministers have now extended that agreement, with grants to be allocated to survivors on a needs basis, as assessed by the Thalidomide Trust. Mr Yousaf said: ""This funding is used to give thalidomide survivors as much assistance as they need to maintain their independence. It has been a vital support in helping people adapt their homes and manage their pain. ""I hope this lifelong commitment to continue this support will reassure recipients and help them deal with any challenges they face."" David Fullerton from Loanhead in Midlothian is thalidomide impaired. He has a short left arm, and no wrists or thumbs. Now 60, he is relieved to feel some security. He told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotland programme: ""Myself and the cohort are all growing old together but deteriorating a little faster than normal on top of those original disabilities. ""It is a relief the Scottish government has recognised there is an ongoing need to support that extra cost to help us be independent for the rest of our lives, the last part of our lives."" He explained some of the costs. ""For myself, every item of clothing for my upper body needs to be adjusted so the adjustments can cost more than the piece of clothing. ""Cars have to be adjusted and adapted, homes need to be adapted. ""I can't really use normal gym equipment so I have to have a personal trainer come round and help set up equipment and strap me into machines, things that impact on almost every aspect of living."" David Fullerton is affected by thalidomide birth defects - he has a short left arm, and no wrists or thumbs Mr Fullerton does not see the commitment as compensation but as a mitigation of extra costs. He said his disabilities over the years had caused a lot of distress. ""My mother, my brothers and sisters, my partners have all been affected by it."" He added: ""Drug safety and medical safety is based on this disaster but it doesn't end for us. ""There is still a case against the German company which produced the drug in the first place."" Mr Fullerton would have liked to see some liability apportioned and said it would have been nice for it to have been settled right at the beginning. ""Right throughout our lives it has just been topping up, topping up,"" he said. ""And I have no doubt in 10 years' time when everyone is 70-73 there will be more complicated medical issues to be dealt with and more complicated independent living issues so it will need to be revisited. But it is a relief to have this support."" Deborah Jack, executive director of the Thalidomide Trust, said the latest funding announcement was ""fantastic and very welcome news"". She added: ""Sadly, as our beneficiaries age they are experiencing multiple health problems, in addition to their original thalidomide damage, and the costs of meeting their complex needs are significant. ""Many of them have been really anxious about the prospect of this much-needed funding coming to an end. ""We are really pleased that the Scottish government has recognised this by committing to lifetime financial support and also agreeing to review the level of funding regularly to ensure it is meeting their changing needs."" Scotland played a leading role in dealing with the impact of thalidomide in the past. In 1961, Edinburgh GP Ekke Kuenssberg and two colleagues were among the first to realise the danger it posed to babies in the womb. The city's Princess Margaret Rose Hospital became a world centre in helping young survivors and provided artificially-powered limbs they could control themselves.

Kellogg's loses fight over sugary cereal offersIt means products like Crunchy Nut Corn Flakes will not be allowed in end of aisle promotions.BusinessComments,"Kellogg's will not be allowed to promote sugary cereals in supermarket special offers, a court has ruled. In-store promotions on food and drink high in fat, salt or sugar will be restrictedunder new rules for England.,external Food giant Kellogg's had taken the government to court arguing the rules did not take into account the nutritional value of added milk. But the Royal Courts of Justice ruled in favour of the government. Kellogg's said it was ""disappointed"". ""It makes little sense to us that consumers will be able to buy other products, like donuts and chocolate spreads, on promotion - but not many types of breakfast cereals,"" said Kellogg UK managing director, Chris Silcock. The Department of Health and Social Care said it strongly welcomed the judgement as location promotion restrictions were expected to deliver more than Â£57bn of health benefits. ""Together with the volume price restrictions, these changes will protect children up and down the country from products high in saturated fat, sugar or salt,"" a spokesperson said. Kellogg's takes government to court over food rules From October, foods deemed high in fat, sugar or salt will be banned from prime spots such as checkouts, store entrances, aisle ends and their online equivalents. The halt on promotions such as buy-one-get-one-free offers has been delayed by the government for 12 months due to the cost of living crisis. Popular Kellogg's brands such as Crunchy Nut Corn Flakes and Fruit and Fibre are classified as high sugar in their dry form. But Kellogg's argued including added milk would change the calculation by reducing the proportion of sugar and salt content relative to the weight of the overall serving. The company said independent market data showed cereals were eaten with milk or yoghurt in 92% of cases. But Judge Mr Justice Linden said Kellogg's cereals ""do not come with instructions for preparation which say that they should be consumed with milk"". Mr Justice Linden said there was ""no dispute"" that breakfast cereals can be part of a healthy diet. He added, however, that promoting the nutritional benefits of a particular breakfast cereal ""does not affect the point that if it contains excess fat, sugar or salt, that feature of the product is adverse to a child's health"". ""Nor does mixing a breakfast cereal which is high in, for example, sugar, with milk alter the fact that it is high in sugar."" His judgement said he found no unfairness to Kellogg's and the public health case for the new rules was compelling, proportionate and rational. Kellogg's Mr Silcock said the firm would not appeal against the judgement, but urged the government to rethink the new rules. ""By restricting the placement of items in supermarkets, people face less choice and potentially higher prices,"" he added.

Here are the main headlines: Ukraine Recovery Conference: In other developments:  That's it from us. Today's live page was written by Sam Hancock, George Wright, Catherine Evans, James Harness, Victoria Lindrea, Alexandra FouchÃ© and Malu Cursino. Our editors were Jeremy Gahagan, Rob Corp, Heather Sharp and Claire Heald. The archbishop of Russia's Belgorod western region has called for an end to the ""bloodshed on Ukrainian soil"" -  in a rare display of public opposition to the Kremlin. His remarks - reported in the Russian media -followed a series of missile strikes on the Russian cities of Belgorod and Kursk on Ukraine's border- which Moscow has blamed on Kyiv. ""Last night, missiles from the armed forces of Ukraine hit sleeping Belgorod people in residential areas,"" the archbishop wrote, in a statement posted on the church's official website. ""Among the dead were residents of [Ukraine's] Kharkiv region who came to seek shelter from the war in peaceful Belgorod. ""We call for a special prayer for the repose of the deceased and for the recovery of the injured; for an end to the bloodshed that is taking place on Ukrainian soil, but which today has also reached our homes.""

In her fifth floor apartment in the Russian city of Belgorod, Lidiya tells me of her narrow escape. ""At 10 past three on Sunday morning I was woken by a blinding flash and a loud explosion. I ran onto my balcony and saw a giant ball of flames heading towards the building. ""I ran inside. Suddenly all my windows shattered. ""Down below I heard shouting and crying. I could see rescuers digging people out of the rubble and carrying away the bodies."" Russia accusesUkraine of launching three missiles at Belgorod. Ukrainian officials have denied it. But whatever it was that exploded in this southern city, the emergency has completely undermined Moscow's claim that it ordered troops into Ukraine to make Russia safer. In reality, the security situation in Belgorod, and other Russian regions near the Ukrainian border, has deteriorated since the invasion. ""This is the first time something like this has happened in the city,"" Lidiya tells me. ""There was no shelling in the city of Belgorod half a year ago."" Local officials say four civilians were killed in the explosion and dozens of houses damaged. Across the border the scale of destruction has been far greater. Since the start of the Russian invasion, thousands of civilians have been killed in Ukraine and some cities have been reduced to rubble by repeated shelling. ""We need to live in peace with Ukraine.

In a speech to the conference, Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal says the confiscated assets of Russia and its oligarchs should be used to rebuild his country. Shmyhal says Russia should be held accountable for the destruction caused by the war. This video can not be played WATCH: Ursula von der Leyen says Ukraine can emerge from the war a stronger country Speaking at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Switzerland, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen says the Kremlin wants to undermine the existence of Ukraine. However, Ukraine can emerge from the war as a stronger and more modern country, she says. As we've been reporting this afternoon, the Ukraine Recovery Conference is under way in Lugano, Switzerland. World leaders and international organisations have been discussing how they will support Ukraine in its recovery and reconstruction, following Russia's invasion on 24 February. Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Ukraine needs $750bn for a recovery plan. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said the EU has mobilised around â¬6.2bn (Â£5.3bn) in financial support for Ukraine since the start of Russia's invasion. But, also on the agenda, are anti-corruption pledges and demands from Ukraine. Swiss President Ignazio Cassis, co-host of the conference, said: ""It is crucial that these efforts continue unwaveringly, especially in the fight against corruption, improving transparency and the independence of the judiciary, and that they are not stalled by the war."" A side event to discuss anti-corruption strategies has been organised alongside the two-day conference. This is co-hosted by the EU Anti-Corruption Initiative (EUACI), which was set up in 2017 with the aim of reducing corruption in Ukraine at the national and local level. Mathias Cormann, secretary general of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) spoke at the Ukraine Recovery Conference. He said Ukraine was working closely with the OECD in an anti-corruption initiative that aims to tackle bribery and other forms of corruption in the country. This video can not be played President Putin will find ""new targets"" if Russia is not stopped in its war against Ukraine, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson tells MPs in the House of Commons. He says the goal must be for ""our Ukrainians friends"" to win and that Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelensky must have the ""strength to finish this war"". He's been updating MPs after the Nato summit in Madrid last week. Leaders of the G7 group of rich nations are looking at the possibility of getting much-need Ukrainian grain out of the country ""in smaller quantities"" via the River Danube river, UK PM Boris Johnson also tells MPs. The World Trade Organization said a food crisis as a result of the Ukraine war could last for years without intervention. Millions of tonnes of grain are sitting in warehouses and Ukrainian ports that cannot be exported due to a combination of anti-ship mines in the Black Sea and a Russian naval blockade. Read more on that here. Johnson says the UK is not looking at breaching the Montreux Convention - an international agreement that regulates maritime traffic in the Black Sea - and there are alternative solutions that don't involve the presence of British warships. Johnson says getting grain out of Ukraine ""might involve a tougher approach, but what we are also looking at is the possibility of using the rivers, using the Danube in particular"". But, he adds, this might have to be done ""in smaller quantities"" rather than ""a giant maritime convoy"" using the Black Sea. Away from the action in Ukraine and in diplomatic moves, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been updating the MPs in the House of Commons after he spent the last week attending international summits in Africa and Europe, where the conflict in Ukraine dominated. Here's what he had to say:  Labour leader Keir Starmer replied: Sarah RainsfordEastern Europe correspondent, reporting from Kyiv (l-r) Mark, âSkifâ and Nikolai: mechanic, businessman and medic - turned soldiers Three Ukrainian soldiers whoâve served in the Donbas have described the fighting there as
brutal. They say the Russian troops they faced are far more experienced and
ruthless than those who tried to take Kyiv in the spring. âRussians like to destroy a city, a village, totally. Never mind whoâs
there - Ukrainian civilians or military,â Mark, a volunteer fighter just
back from the front line in the Luhansk region, told me. He said Russia was using its overwhelming firepower to ""wipe out"" villages in its advance, leaving the Ukrainians with little cover. Another soldier,
Nikolai, told me heâd be lying if he didnât admit it was ""terrifying"". They asked
for more support, more weapons. All three soldiers agree with Ukraine pulling back when its troops are
outgunned: âItâs very hard to hold ground. Itâs a lot of deaths. Thereâs
nothing left there now anyway. No civilians. No city. They bombed it all."" They canât give details of casualties, but talked of ""so many"". âPeople
we studied with, shared food with, volunteers like us. Many are gone.â And yet, they insisted they would go back to the Donbas within days to fight
on. âWe want payback,â said Nikolai. âAnd we want to protect our
families, our friends, from the terrible things that Russians do with our civilians.
[What happened in] Irpin, Hostemel, Bucha... we canât let it happen again.â Sophie WilliamsReporting from Kyiv Turning to the situation on the ground in that region, Serhiy Haidai, head of Luhansk regional administration, says that more than 10,000 people are left in Lysychansk in eastern Ukraine. He made the remarks during an interview with Ukrainian media. Lysychansk is the latest city to have been taken by Russian troops. Ukrainian military said that after heavy fighting, defending forces were forced to withdraw from their positions. Russian cosmonauts on the ISS held the flag of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic In March, not long after Russia invaded Ukraine, three Russian cosmonauts boarded the International Space Station wearing yellow and blue, in what many perceived as a show of support for Ukraine. They were warmly welcomed on board, hugging and greeting their  American, Russian and German fellow crew members. The Russian space agency denied the claims. ""Sometimes yellow is just yellow,"" said the Roscosmos space agency at the time. But now Denis Matveyev, Oleg Artemyev and Sergey Korsakov have been pictured celebrating Russia's
capture of the last major city in the eastern Ukrainian region of Luhansk. Many thought the team were showing solidarity with Ukraine in March, although the Russian space agency denied this The agency posted pictures of the three men smiling as they held up flags of Russia's proxies in eastern Ukraine, the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic and Donetsk People's Republic. ""This is a long-awaited day that the residents of the occupied areas of the Luhansk region had been waiting eight years for,"" Roscosmos wrote on the Telegram messaging app. ""We are convinced that July 3, 2022, will forever remain in the history of the (Luhansk People's) Republic."" As we've been reporting, leaders from dozens of countries and international organisations are meeting in Lugano, Switzerland to discuss the reconstruction of Ukraine. What's happening? It's an event that's been happening every year since 2017, usually called the Ukraine Reform Conference, but this year renamed the Ukraine Recovery Conference. It is usually an opportunity for Ukraine to show other nations the progress it is making and for international partners to express support. Why is this meeting so significant? This is the first URC since Russian's invasion in February, leaving those in attendance with the sizeable task of trying to map out Ukraine's road to recovery from a war that has left entire pockets of the country in ruins. It is not a conference where donors will be pledging money. It aims to establish the principle and priorities for a reconstruction project that is being compared in scale to the US Marshall Plan for Europe after the Second World War. What's on the agenda? Ukraine conference is expected to work towards a ""Lugano Declaration"" and to begin to work out a road map for the reconstruction of Ukraine. Kyiv's own recovery plan will be discussed, as well as roles and  contributions of international partners. The conference website says social, economic, environmental and infrastructure recovery will all be considered, as well as reforms that are possible or necessary to implement in the current situation. What's needed for recovery? Ukraine's PM Denys Shmyal, who is in Switzerland at the summit, told attendees that his country needed $750bn for a recovery plan. It comes after more than $100bn worth of damage was caused to Ukrainian infrastructure during the fighting, he said. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv It seems
almost certain that Russia will push on to try and take the rest of the Donbas region,
especially the cities of Slavyansk and Kramatorsk - both of which were shelled
in recent days. Kramatorsk is said to hold particular significance to the
separatist movement, being the site of the first uprisings in 2014. Beyond that, the wider Russian strategy is not clear. Much will depend on the state of their
forces if - or when - they take the Donbas region. Putin has tacitly acknowledged this, saying: âThe units that took part in
active hostilities and achieved success and victory in the Luhansk direction
should certainly rest and increase their combat capabilities.â If they are still making rapid advances, they could continue their push to take the entire south of Ukraine, up to and maybe even including the major city of Dnipro or beyond. If, however, they are as exhausted as many analysts predict, and as Putin hinted, it is conceivable they will declare an end to the âspecial military operationâ, Russiaâs euphemistic phrase for this full scale war. They might hope a unilateral ceasefire would take some steam out of the international support for Ukraine, with some, perhaps France and Germany, pushing for peace. Ukraine would no doubt continue the fight, but without a steady stream of weaponry, it could be that the front line becomes a frozen conflict, much like it did between 2014 and 2022. That would suit Russia, keeping its neighbour in a state of turmoil and unrest. Read more here. The cargo ship is anchored about 1km from the shore, outside Karasu port in northwest Turkey Turkish officials have detained a Russian-flagged cargo ship off the Black Sea coast, which Ukraine claims is carrying stolen grain, according to Reuters. ""Upon request, the ship named Zhibek Zholy was halted off [the port of]

Karasu,"" the news agency quoted a senior Turkish official as saying on Monday. Allegations of stolen Ukrainian grain were ""being investigated thoroughly"", the official said, with Russia, the United Nations and third parties involved in talks. An official at Ukraine's Foreign Ministry, citing the nation's maritime administration, told Reuters the ship was carrying the first consignment of 4,500 tonnes of grain from Berdyansk, a Russian-occupied port in south Ukraine. A decision regarding the cargo would be made following a meeting of investigators on Monday, said Vasyl Bodnar, Ukraine's ambassador to Turkey, on national TV - adding that Ukraine was hoping for the confiscation of the grain. Kyiv has accused Moscow of stealing grain from a number ofterritories seized by Russian forces since the invasionbegan in February. The Kremlin has previously denied stealing Ukrainian grain. British Foreign Minister Liz Truss has called for a new Marshall Plan - the post-World War Two US aid program for Europe - to re-build Ukraine. Truss said the new aid program needs to be driven by Ukraine itself and there should be an immediate push to support Ukrainians' return to their homeland. She said it is important to give people ""hope about the future"". Truss said the UK would be hosting next year's Ukraine Reconstruction Conference, which will include key British stakeholders. She added the UK would ""continue to lead in supporting the Ukrainian government's reconstruction and development plan"". The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has said the Kremlin's goal is the military, political and economic destruction of Ukraine. She said Russia wanted to undermine Ukraine's very existence as a state and this could not be allowed to happen. The EU will set up a reconstruction platform to co-ordinate the
rebuilding of Ukraine once the war ends, she added. The platform will be used to map investment needs,
co-ordinate action and channel resources, she told the
Ukraine Recovery Conference in Switzerland. The EU has mobilised around â¬6.2bn (Â£5.3bn) in financial support since the start of Russia's invasion, she said. ""And... more will come. We will engage substantially in the
mid- and long-term reconstruction."" Cities such as Kharkiv have been devastated by the war Ukraine needs $750bn for a recovery plan in the wake of Russia's invasion - Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Monday. Shmyhal told the Ukraine Recovery Conference, currently taking place in Switzerland, there had been over $100bn of direct damage to infrastructure from Russian aggression. The two-day conference in Lugano, which has already heard from President Zelensky, is bringing together several world leaders and NGOs with the aim of drawing up a roadmap for Ukraine's reconstruction after the war. Talks are under way in Lugano, southern Switzerland, to discuss the reconstruction of Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said rebuilding Ukraine was the ""common task of the whole democratic world"". Speaking via video link during the international conference, Zelensky said the ""reconstruction of Ukraine is the biggest contribution to the support of global peace"". Several world leaders and international organisations are attending the two-day conference. They are meeting to draw up a roadmap for Ukraine's recovery and reconstruction. Sophie WilliamsReporting from Kyiv Here in Ukraine, there are reports that Russian forces are
trying to start âadministrative activitiesâ in Severodonetsk. Oleksandr Stryuk, Ukrainian head of the Severodonetsk city military-civilian
administration says a commandantâs office is being set up in order to
conduct a census of the city's population. âThey are now intensively looking for housing and communal
services specialists to at least somehow restore the cityâs infrastructure,â
Stryuk said, adding that portable generators will not be enough to get the city
back up and running. Russia took full control of the city last month. The city
was once home to some 100,000 people but most of its residents are thought to
have fled. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Go-slow fuel protests cause motorway delays,"This video can not be played Watch: Motorways brought to a standstill by fuel price protesters More than a dozen protesters were arrested for driving too slowly during demonstrations on motorways in England, Wales and Scotland over fuel prices. The go-slow action mainly targeted three-lane motorways with convoys of vehicles crawling along two lanes - leaving the ""fast"" outside lane free. Twelve people were arrested during a protest on the M4, which led to the Prince of Wales Bridge, between England and Wales, being closed. Another man was arrested near the A38. Protesters, organised under the social media banner Fuel Price Stand Against Tax, drove in a series of convoys at 30mph (48.3km/h) to cause gridlock on major roads and motorways. Chief Superintendent Tom Harding from Gwent Police said people had been arrested for driving under 30mph for a ""prolonged amount of time"". The roads affected by disruption included: the M4 and Prince of Wales Bridge the M5 in Devon the M32 in Gloucestershire the A38 in Devon the M180 in Lincolnshire the A12 in Essex the A92 in Scotland the A64 near York Gwent Police said organisers of the protest had been given a legal notice to prevent them from blocking the bridge over the River Severn and from driving under 30mph. Ch Supt Harding said restrictions had been placed on the protest as otherwise ""emergency and critical services"" would have been restricted. Tariq Akram said other cars joined the convoy as it went by Tariq Akram said his was one of 50 vehicles making the 60-mile journey through Scunthorpe and Doncaster at 20mph. The Scunthorpe truck driver told the BBC his company had added Â£4,000 to its fuel bill in the past four months because of rising prices. ""The turnout was absolutely fantastic. There were 35 vehicles from our yard alone who took part,"" he said. ""At one point, I thought some cars wanted to overtake so I tried to let them by, then I realised they were joining in."" Police Scotland has told drivers to drive at an appropriate speed for the conditions Avon and Somerset Police said all protests in its area had finished and thanked the public for their patience in a tweet at 15:20 BST. Earlier, Devon and Cornwall Police said it was aware of a go-slow protest heading northbound from Exeter services on the M5. The force also said a further protest began on the A38 heading north from Ivybridge, where a man in his 50s was arrested after ignoring a warning about unsafe driving. ""Unfortunately we have had unsafe driving on the A38 including vehicles travelling at a dangerously low speed,"" a force spokesman said. Why is petrol so expensive in the UK? Fact vs fiction: Five tips for saving petrol money examined Steve Nash, who got stuck on the M5, said the protesters might be ""going about it the wrong way"" Steve Nash, who was delayed on the M5 by protesters as he drove to Exeter Airport to return a hire car, is hopeful the delay will not result in a penalty fee. ""I'm not sure what they're achieving - other than inconveniencing people,"" he said. ""I'm not critical of the sentiment behind what they're trying to do, I just think they're possibly going about it the wrong way."" The retired civil servant from Tiverton said his journey that would usually take 20 minutes took an hour on Monday. He said he felt the protesters should be ""stood outside parliament or writing to their MPs"". ""I think it's not affecting the people you need to actually protest, which is Parliament. The protesters have actually inconvenienced everyone else who is inconvenienced by high fuel prices."" Police Scotland said it had beenaware of protests on motorways and trunk roadsand urged motorists to drive at an appropriate speed for the road conditions. But the force had warned journey times could be longer than normal. In Lincolnshire, police blocked junction one between the M180 and M18 forcing protesters to remain on the former. West Yorkshire Police said a ""single tyre deflation device"" - also known as a ""stinger"" - had been deployed, but it was not used. West Mercia Police said some of the tactics used during a protest on the M54, which had ended by about 08:30 BST, had ""compromised the safety of other road users"" and said officers wouldtake action against those who committed traffic offences. A Facebook event called Stand Up to Fuel Prices, with more than 57,000 responses, had called for people to take their cars, lorries and tractors to cause roadblocks all over the country ""until there is change"". The organisers wrote that fuel costs were driving up other costs of living and said they hoped the more people that joined the protest, the sooner living costs would drop. Fuel prices have risen to record highs in recent weeks with figures from data firm Experian showing the average price of a litre of petrol at UK forecourts had hit 191.5p and 199.0p for diesel on Sunday. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said there did not appear to be any sign of retailers reducing forecourt prices, despite weekly wholesale costs having fallen for five weeks. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said he will carefully consider calls for a ""more substantial"" fuel duty cut after the 5p per litre reduction implemented in March failed to halt price rises. Rising fuel prices have been pushed even higher by the war in Ukraine, with Russia, one of the world's largest oil exporters, facing sanctions. A convoy of vehicles on the M180 in Lincolnshire Police escort vehicles across the Prince of Wales Bridge, which runs between England and Wales The government had said while it understands people are struggling with rising prices and have a right to protest, ""people's day-to-day lives should not be disrupted"" and warned traffic delays ""will only add to fuel use"". Howard Cox, founder of campaign group FairFuelUK, said other countries had cut fuel duty more than the UK and called for a reduction of at least 20p. While he said his organisation was not involved in the protests, he said there was an appetite for them - and if the government did not deliver on the issue there could be ""some serious escalation of protests"".

EasyJet deputy quits after major flight disruption,"EasyJet's chief operating officer has resigned after a series of flight cancellations and disruption at the airline in recent weeks. The airline said Peter Bellew had left ""to pursue other business opportunities"" and wished him well. It comes after thousands of EasyJet flights have been cancelled - some at short notice. Trade union Unite last month criticised a ""lack of leadership"" at the airline and urged Mr Bellew to ""take control"". Announcing Mr Bellew's resignation, EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said the airline was ""absolutely focused on delivering a safe and reliable operation this summer"". Flight cancellation plan aims to ease summer chaos He said the role of interim chief operations officer would be in the ""very capable hands of"" David Morgan ""who will provide strong leadership for the airline this summer"". Mr Morgan has been with EasyJet since 2016 and is currently director of flight operations. He had previously led overall operations at the airline, as interim chief operating officer in 2019. The aviation sector shed thousands of jobs during the pandemic, but is now struggling to meet the rebound in demand for travel. EasyJet has been one of the worst hit for cancellations in recent months. It has axed thousands of flights, including many on the day they were due to depart. Late last month it said it would be making some cancellations over the summer, to build in more resilience and in response to caps imposed by London Gatwick and Amsterdam Schiphol airports. It said this gave customers advance notice and potential to re-book. While it will have made use ofthe government's landing slot ""amnesty""as part of this plan, EasyJet said it would not be announcing any further cancellations this week. It said the last affected customers would be told on Monday. In optimistic quotes in EasyJet's late January trading update, its boss Johan Lundgren predicted ""a strong summer ahead"", with demand pushing capacity near to 2019 levels. Six months later, with Covid restrictions largely behind them, people want to go on holiday again. Demand doesn't appear to have been a problem. But ambitions have evidently had to be scaled back. Thousands of flights have had to be cancelled. Today, the airline's boss says a ""safe and reliable"" operation is the ""absolute"" focus. EasyJet is far from the only business affected by widespread issues hitting aviation at the moment - from staff shortages to industrial action. It hopes not to have to issue any further waves of cancellations, and points out it's still running up to 1,700 flights each day. However, it has undeniably been through a challenging time of late and must be hoping that a change at the top can herald a change in performance. It is understood just over 150,000 of the 160,000 EasyJet flights initially scheduled to run over July, August and September, will go ahead. This means roughly 10,000 have been cancelled - or about 6%. The airline said the majority of its flights were unaffected by the cancellations, with it continuing to operate up to 1,700 flights a day. However, unions representing EasyJet cabin crew in Spain have called a series of 24-hour strikes for July in a dispute over pay. The first of the strikes took place over the weekend, and a further six days of action are due later this month. Shares in EasyJet, which have fallen back to the lows of March 2020 at the start of the pandemic, were trading down almost 3% after news of Mr Bellew's departure - making it one of the biggest fallers on the FTSE 250 index. More cancellations from a raft of airlines are expected this week as the government has given carriers until Friday to announce changes to their schedules without facing a potential penalty. The move is an attempt to minimise disruption during the peak summer holiday season. Do you work at an airport? Do you have a summer holiday coming up? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

Kellogg's loses fight over sugary cereal offers,"Kellogg's will not be allowed to promote sugary cereals in supermarket special offers, a court has ruled. In-store promotions on food and drink high in fat, salt or sugar will be restrictedunder new rules for England.,external Food giant Kellogg's had taken the government to court arguing the rules did not take into account the nutritional value of added milk. But the Royal Courts of Justice ruled in favour of the government. Kellogg's said it was ""disappointed"". ""It makes little sense to us that consumers will be able to buy other products, like donuts and chocolate spreads, on promotion - but not many types of breakfast cereals,"" said Kellogg UK managing director, Chris Silcock. The Department of Health and Social Care said it strongly welcomed the judgement as location promotion restrictions were expected to deliver more than Â£57bn of health benefits. ""Together with the volume price restrictions, these changes will protect children up and down the country from products high in saturated fat, sugar or salt,"" a spokesperson said. Kellogg's takes government to court over food rules From October, foods deemed high in fat, sugar or salt will be banned from prime spots such as checkouts, store entrances, aisle ends and their online equivalents. The halt on promotions such as buy-one-get-one-free offers has been delayed by the government for 12 months due to the cost of living crisis. Popular Kellogg's brands such as Crunchy Nut Corn Flakes and Fruit and Fibre are classified as high sugar in their dry form. But Kellogg's argued including added milk would change the calculation by reducing the proportion of sugar and salt content relative to the weight of the overall serving. The company said independent market data showed cereals were eaten with milk or yoghurt in 92% of cases. But Judge Mr Justice Linden said Kellogg's cereals ""do not come with instructions for preparation which say that they should be consumed with milk"". Mr Justice Linden said there was ""no dispute"" that breakfast cereals can be part of a healthy diet. He added, however, that promoting the nutritional benefits of a particular breakfast cereal ""does not affect the point that if it contains excess fat, sugar or salt, that feature of the product is adverse to a child's health"". ""Nor does mixing a breakfast cereal which is high in, for example, sugar, with milk alter the fact that it is high in sugar."" His judgement said he found no unfairness to Kellogg's and the public health case for the new rules was compelling, proportionate and rational. Kellogg's Mr Silcock said the firm would not appeal against the judgement, but urged the government to rethink the new rules. ""By restricting the placement of items in supermarkets, people face less choice and potentially higher prices,"" he added.

TV chef becomes first Scottish Seafood Ambassador,"Monica Galetti was a judge on MasterChef: The Professionals, until earlier this year Acclaimed TV chef Monica Galetti has been named as the first Scottish Seafood Ambassador. The former MasterChef Professionals judge will lead the way in encouraging UK hospitality venues to offer more Scottish seafood. Seafood from Scotland has created the new Sea the People campaign, which Galetti will head as ambassador. She is an advocate for Scottish-sourced seafood and is calling for more fish and shellfish to be sold in the UK. In preparation for the role, Galetti travelled around Scottish costal communities to speak to people behind the industry, including fishermen, salmon farmers, fish smokers, oyster growers, processers and entrepreneurs. Galetti said: ""Sea the People is vital because, at its heart, the Scottish seafood industry depends on these men and women to maintain and grow its premium status. ""I would love to see UK restaurants and retailers stocking more Scottish fish and shellfish - fished or farmed. At present, around 80% is exported. ""We have a collective responsibility to introduce different species to consumers, in a way that encourages them to look beyond the familiar. For me, Scottish seafood is synonymous with the best quality in the world, and we definitely need to be shouting about it."" Head of trade marketing at Seafood Scotland, Adam Wing, said: ""As a chef and restaurateur, Monica is in an ideal position to encourage young chefs and buyers to take a closer look at what we can offer and to help them appreciate the effort that goes into producing such high-quality fish and shellfish. ""Scotland's fishing industry is one of the oldest in the country and many businesses have been handed down through the generations, with knowledge and skills passed on through families and communities. ""This knowledge, combined with astute investment in innovation and technology - and a bigger focus on sustainability - will ensure that Scottish seafood continues to punch above its weight in global food markets.""

EasyJet chief operating officer resigns,"EasyJet's chief operating officer has resigned after a series of flight cancellations and disruption at the airline in recent weeks. The airline said Peter Bellew had left ""to pursue other business opportunities"" and wished him well. It comes after thousands of EasyJet flights have been cancelled - some at short notice. Trade union Unite last month criticised a ""lack of leadership"" at the airline and urged Mr Bellew to ""take control"". Announcing Mr Bellew's resignation, EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said the airline was ""absolutely focused on delivering a safe and reliable operation this summer"". Flight cancellation plan aims to ease summer chaos He said the role of interim chief operations officer would be in the ""very capable hands of"" David Morgan ""who will provide strong leadership for the airline this summer"". Mr Morgan has been with EasyJet since 2016 and is currently director of flight operations. He had previously led overall operations at the airline, as interim chief operating officer in 2019. The aviation sector shed thousands of jobs during the pandemic, but is now struggling to meet the rebound in demand for travel. EasyJet has been one of the worst hit for cancellations in recent months. It has axed thousands of flights, including many on the day they were due to depart. Late last month it said it would be making some cancellations over the summer, to build in more resilience and in response to caps imposed by London Gatwick and Amsterdam Schiphol airports. It said this gave customers advance notice and potential to re-book. While it will have made use ofthe government's landing slot ""amnesty""as part of this plan, EasyJet said it would not be announcing any further cancellations this week. It said the last affected customers would be told on Monday. In optimistic quotes in EasyJet's late January trading update, its boss Johan Lundgren predicted ""a strong summer ahead"", with demand pushing capacity near to 2019 levels. Six months later, with Covid restrictions largely behind them, people want to go on holiday again. Demand doesn't appear to have been a problem. But ambitions have evidently had to be scaled back. Thousands of flights have had to be cancelled. Today, the airline's boss says a ""safe and reliable"" operation is the ""absolute"" focus. EasyJet is far from the only business affected by widespread issues hitting aviation at the moment - from staff shortages to industrial action. It hopes not to have to issue any further waves of cancellations, and points out it's still running up to 1,700 flights each day. However, it has undeniably been through a challenging time of late and must be hoping that a change at the top can herald a change in performance. It is understood just over 150,000 of the 160,000 EasyJet flights initially scheduled to run over July, August and September, will go ahead. This means roughly 10,000 have been cancelled - or about 6%. The airline said the majority of its flights were unaffected by the cancellations, with it continuing to operate up to 1,700 flights a day. However, unions representing EasyJet cabin crew in Spain have called a series of 24-hour strikes for July in a dispute over pay. The first of the strikes took place over the weekend, and a further six days of action are due later this month. Shares in EasyJet, which have fallen back to the lows of March 2020 at the start of the pandemic, were trading down almost 3% after news of Mr Bellew's departure - making it one of the biggest fallers on the FTSE 250 index. More cancellations from a raft of airlines are expected this week as the government has given carriers until Friday to announce changes to their schedules without facing a potential penalty. The move is an attempt to minimise disruption during the peak summer holiday season. Do you work at an airport? Do you have a summer holiday coming up? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"Caterpillar strike ends after direct pay offerThe firm says a direct offer to Larne and Belfast staff received a ""strong and favourable"" response.Northern Ireland","Caterpillar has facilities in Larne and Belfast A strike at the manufacturing company Caterpillar has ended, the company has confirmed. It comes after a pay offer was made directly to its Northern Ireland workforce after the firm failed to reach agreement with trade union Unite. In a statement on Monday, the company said the response to its offer had been ""strong and favourable"". ""We are pleased the union has cancelled its additional weeks of industrial action,"" the statement said. Members of the Unite union, employed by the firm in Larne and Belfast, have been on strike since April.

In a letter to staff it said: ""We are not walking away from our relationship with the union and remain committed to collective bargaining procedures for future terms and conditions."" Caterpillar said it was offering a 9% base salary increase effective from 1 April 2022 and a one-time lump sum equal to 2.6% of wages earned from 1 April 2021 to 1 April 2022.

Go-slow fuel protests cause motorway delaysConvoys of protesters are driving slowly on motorways as they call for fuel duty to be cut.UK,"This video can not be played Watch: Motorways brought to a standstill by fuel price protesters More than a dozen protesters were arrested for driving too slowly during demonstrations on motorways in England, Wales and Scotland over fuel prices. The go-slow action mainly targeted three-lane motorways with convoys of vehicles crawling along two lanes - leaving the ""fast"" outside lane free. Twelve people were arrested during a protest on the M4, which led to the Prince of Wales Bridge, between England and Wales, being closed. Another man was arrested near the A38. Protesters, organised under the social media banner Fuel Price Stand Against Tax, drove in a series of convoys at 30mph (48.3km/h) to cause gridlock on major roads and motorways. Chief Superintendent Tom Harding from Gwent Police said people had been arrested for driving under 30mph for a ""prolonged amount of time"". The roads affected by disruption included: the M4 and Prince of Wales Bridge the M5 in Devon the M32 in Gloucestershire the A38 in Devon the M180 in Lincolnshire the A12 in Essex the A92 in Scotland the A64 near York Gwent Police said organisers of the protest had been given a legal notice to prevent them from blocking the bridge over the River Severn and from driving under 30mph. Ch Supt Harding said restrictions had been placed on the protest as otherwise ""emergency and critical services"" would have been restricted. Tariq Akram said other cars joined the convoy as it went by Tariq Akram said his was one of 50 vehicles making the 60-mile journey through Scunthorpe and Doncaster at 20mph. The Scunthorpe truck driver told the BBC his company had added Â£4,000 to its fuel bill in the past four months because of rising prices. ""The turnout was absolutely fantastic. There were 35 vehicles from our yard alone who took part,"" he said. ""At one point, I thought some cars wanted to overtake so I tried to let them by, then I realised they were joining in."" Police Scotland has told drivers to drive at an appropriate speed for the conditions Avon and Somerset Police said all protests in its area had finished and thanked the public for their patience in a tweet at 15:20 BST. Earlier, Devon and Cornwall Police said it was aware of a go-slow protest heading northbound from Exeter services on the M5. The force also said a further protest began on the A38 heading north from Ivybridge, where a man in his 50s was arrested after ignoring a warning about unsafe driving. ""Unfortunately we have had unsafe driving on the A38 including vehicles travelling at a dangerously low speed,"" a force spokesman said. Why is petrol so expensive in the UK? Fact vs fiction: Five tips for saving petrol money examined Steve Nash, who got stuck on the M5, said the protesters might be ""going about it the wrong way"" Steve Nash, who was delayed on the M5 by protesters as he drove to Exeter Airport to return a hire car, is hopeful the delay will not result in a penalty fee. ""I'm not sure what they're achieving - other than inconveniencing people,"" he said. ""I'm not critical of the sentiment behind what they're trying to do, I just think they're possibly going about it the wrong way."" The retired civil servant from Tiverton said his journey that would usually take 20 minutes took an hour on Monday. He said he felt the protesters should be ""stood outside parliament or writing to their MPs"". ""I think it's not affecting the people you need to actually protest, which is Parliament. The protesters have actually inconvenienced everyone else who is inconvenienced by high fuel prices."" Police Scotland said it had beenaware of protests on motorways and trunk roadsand urged motorists to drive at an appropriate speed for the road conditions. But the force had warned journey times could be longer than normal. In Lincolnshire, police blocked junction one between the M180 and M18 forcing protesters to remain on the former. West Yorkshire Police said a ""single tyre deflation device"" - also known as a ""stinger"" - had been deployed, but it was not used. West Mercia Police said some of the tactics used during a protest on the M54, which had ended by about 08:30 BST, had ""compromised the safety of other road users"" and said officers wouldtake action against those who committed traffic offences. A Facebook event called Stand Up to Fuel Prices, with more than 57,000 responses, had called for people to take their cars, lorries and tractors to cause roadblocks all over the country ""until there is change"". The organisers wrote that fuel costs were driving up other costs of living and said they hoped the more people that joined the protest, the sooner living costs would drop. Fuel prices have risen to record highs in recent weeks with figures from data firm Experian showing the average price of a litre of petrol at UK forecourts had hit 191.5p and 199.0p for diesel on Sunday. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said there did not appear to be any sign of retailers reducing forecourt prices, despite weekly wholesale costs having fallen for five weeks. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said he will carefully consider calls for a ""more substantial"" fuel duty cut after the 5p per litre reduction implemented in March failed to halt price rises. Rising fuel prices have been pushed even higher by the war in Ukraine, with Russia, one of the world's largest oil exporters, facing sanctions. A convoy of vehicles on the M180 in Lincolnshire Police escort vehicles across the Prince of Wales Bridge, which runs between England and Wales The government had said while it understands people are struggling with rising prices and have a right to protest, ""people's day-to-day lives should not be disrupted"" and warned traffic delays ""will only add to fuel use"". Howard Cox, founder of campaign group FairFuelUK, said other countries had cut fuel duty more than the UK and called for a reduction of at least 20p. While he said his organisation was not involved in the protests, he said there was an appetite for them - and if the government did not deliver on the issue there could be ""some serious escalation of protests"".

Terrence Higgins: Who's the man behind the name?,"This video can not be played 'Incredibly funny, a complete daredevil and very Welsh' You may have heard the name and might know his legacy, but perhaps don't know who Terrence Higgins really was. He was a charismatic, fun-loving guy, loved by his group of close friends, yet it was only after his death that his name became known the world over. Few know of his unique ""wiggle legs"" dance, the astrology book he wrote and that his sexuality was behind his move to the city where he could be himself. Terry, as he was known, became famous for how he died, but he also lived. His name is now synonymous with the fight against HIV and Aids, because Terry was the first named person in the UK to die of an Aids-related illness. Sam Smith's HIV stories podcast starts with Terrence Higgins' life 'My story helped inspire hit TV show It's A Sin' 'By 25, I'd lost 50 friends to Aids' No-one had heard of the virus HIV when he passed away aged just 37 at London's St Thomas hospital on 4 July 1982 - and very few people had heard of him. But those close friends who knew him so well were determined to not only change that, but also change the way the world dealt with an illness few then knew much about. Superstars and royalty now regularly support the charity that immortalises a man whose death became the unfortunate catalyst for medical research and subsequent treatment that now ensures the illness that ended Terry's life is no longer considered a death sentence. Meghan Markle and Prince Harry's first public appearance together as an engaged couple was at a Terrence Higgins Trust event Within 10 years of Terry's death, proceeds of two musical anthems - Queen's Bohemian Rhapsody and Don't Let the Sun Go Down On Me by Elton John and George Michael - were donated to the Terrence Higgins Trust. It's gestures and support like this, alongside work to help people with HIV and promote good sexual health, that has helped the organisation that carries Terry's name become a world-leading HIV charity. The journey began just before the end of World War Two, in June 1945 in west Wales. Terry was born in the old Haverfordwest workhouse when it became a unit of the local hospital Terrence Lionel Seymour Higgins was born at the old Priory Mount workhouse in the market town of Haverfordwest, Pembrokeshire, to Marjorie - Terry's dad wasn't on his birth certificate. It was in the town's dance halls as a teenager, that school friend Angela Preston remembers him. Terry was renowned for his dancing... some friends called it ""dad dancing"" while others called it a ""wiggle"" ""He would say to me and my friend 'come on girls, up you get', and he'd jive with two of us at the same time,"" she toldBBC Sounds A Positive Life podcast, narrated by singer Sam Smith. ""He was brilliant. I can see him coming down the high street now and his trousers would be flapping. He had a dancer's walk. They have that airiness, that floating movement. ""To me, he was just Terry who I danced with on a Saturday night. Sam Smith has narrated a BBC sounds podcast which chronicles the life of Terrence Higgins ""He had this air about him, he wasn't repressed, he got on with life and seemed to enjoy everything he did - and by heck he had a lovely smile. He was a lovely boy. ""It was only when he died that I found out that he was gay. I was quite shocked because I didn't have an inkling."" SAM SMITH PRESENTS STORIES OF HIV:From Terrence Higgins to today BORN DEAF, RAISED HEARING:What it means to live in two different worlds When Terry was growing up in the 1950s, gay sex between men was illegal and you could be sent to prison. These laws only began to change in 1967 -even then only partially. Bill Yabsley was a few years younger than Terry and said growing up, he was a ""quiet boy"" ""We'd play out in a field which was part of the council estate and occasionally Terry would come down,"" said Billy Yabsley, a neighbour who lived on Terry's street Priory Avenue. ""I was, say 10 and he was 14. He wasn't really a mixer. It was very rare that Terry came out. ""We were rough and ready kids, cricket one minute and football the next, then falling out and fighting - but Terry never got involved with any of that, he was a quiet boy. Priory Avenue in the Pembrokeshire market town of Haverfordwest is where Terry grew up ""I used to go to market hall and they'd turn it into a dance room and I can remember him dancing, he was out of this world. We were like farmers in boots but when he danced, he was light like a ballerina and used to sway his body."" Terry also used to play the piano and Bill remembered ""he was a very talented boy"" who was a decent schoolboy athlete at the strict Haverfordwest Grammar Boys School, where he won the senior long-jump competition in the late 1950s. Terry started life in west Wales at a time when coming out as gay to friends or family could be considered a risky choice as attitudes towards homosexuality were different. ""I would have thought it would have been dreadfully difficult because there was such a stigma attached,"" Angela added. Haverfordwest is an old market town on the banks of the River Cleddau near the western tip of southern Wales After finishing school in the early 60s, Terry left Haverfordwest to join the Royal Navy and lost contact with his old school friends - but not before donating his books and stationery to the school library. ""We would often get visits from Terry when he was in the navy,"" said Terry's cousin Annie Oakley, who now lives in Australia. ""I thought he was so handsome because he had very dark hair and had creases in his trousers because of how they used to fold them over when they were in the navy. Terry (right) with his trademark moustache enjoying the sun with friends ""My earliest memory was when he came to visit us and he was in the front garden, swinging us around... and letting us dance on his feet because he was always dancing."" As far as Annie knows Terry - an only child - never came out to his family, but he did not completely hide his life from them. ""When I was about 14, I stayed at auntie Marj's and Terry was visiting and he had a friend,"" she recalled. This video can not be played How Princess Diana helped changed attitudes to Aids ""It never occurred to me that he had sexual preferences and she said 'can you take this cup of tea up to Terry and his friend'. ""I walked in the bedroom and there were these two males in bed, Terry and his friend, and I just said 'here's a cup of tea'. I was oblivious."" Terry returned to his home-town occasionally to see his mum before she died in 1974. HIV diagnosis at 16 was like 'a wake-up call' 'You can't catch HIV from hugging me' 'My HIV got my daughter kicked out of school' ""He didn't talk about his family much,"" said Linda Payan, one of Terry's few close friends from his life in London to return to Haverfordwest with him. ""His mother was a female version of Terry, you could see they were mother and son. Great fun and she had similar humour to Terry. Sir Elton John is a patron and big supporter of the trust set up in Terry's name ""She could be cutting and he could be quite rude to her, but she'd be rude back. They'd have that kind of relationship. It wasn't really close but they enjoyed each other's company."" Linda said she imagined Marjorie knew her son was gay because she once went back to Terry's childhood home with him and his then boyfriend - but ""nothing was said"". ""She'd have kept that silent, it was a different time and wasn't an accepted thing,"" added Linda. ""It was very taboo."" Terry's old friends Rupert Whitaker and Martyn Butler have received OBEs for their work in helping research into HIV Terry had, by this time, made London his home where he'd enjoy dancing to disco music and felt free to live how he wanted - which could sometimes be like a wheeler-dealer. ""Terry was either with money or without money,"" added Linda, who first met Terry in a Wimpy fast-food restaurant after a night out in 1969. ""When he was without money, I'd see more of him because he'd have jewellery to sell. He'd say 'can you give me some money for them?' and it'd be a fiver or a tenner for all this silver. ""But he was very kind. Whenever he had any money, it was for everyone."" Terry worked for newspapers and wrote for Hansard, the official report of every parliamentary debate in the House of Commons - meaning he worked in the place that had made his sexuality a crime. Terry worked at the Palace of Westminster on Hansard, the official report of all parliamentary debates ""He was a bit paranoid about being found out to be gay,"" recalled Linda. ""Once he said 'I've got some people from work coming over for dinner, could you pretend to be my wife?' So I did."" Terry, a Gemini, had an interest in astrology and wrote a book on the subject called The Living Zodiac and he loved socialising. ""I used to call him wiggle legs,"" added Linda. ""He had these wiggly legs when he danced and it always made me laugh... his legs never seemed to part but his knees were together. ""Life was so exciting for him, he was always looking for new adventures and was very funny. Volunteers for the Terrence Higgins Trust help promote good sexual health and support thousands across the world ""I said to him 'you're either going to be very famous or end up on a park bench'. He laughed his head off on that one. But Terry did become famous."" It was in the gay clubs where Terry became friends with Rupert Whitaker and Martyn Butler - two men who would ensure the name Terrence Higgins would one day become famous around the globe. ""I liked him because he looked out and cared for people,"" said Martyn, who was 20 years younger than Terry. Stephen Fry is a long-term patron of the Terrence Higgins Trust and hosted the comedy revue Hysteria 3 in support of the charity in 1991 ""If you were misbehaving, he'd tell you off. He was a bit motherly like that."" Rupert was 18 when he started a relationship with Terry and was enamoured with his streetwise nature in a time where their community felt marginalised. ""He didn't care about anything, he was completely unselfconscious,"" said Rupert. ""He had a very healthy attitude of scepticism towards any pretentiousness. Terry, Rupert and Martyn would frequent London's many nightclubs like Heaven, where Terry collapsed twice before his death in 1982 ""I thought he was just gorgeous. This was the era of the clones... very short cropped hair, big moustache, strong five o'clock shadow, plaid shirts, tight jeans and builder's boots. ""It was a hyper masculine look and I completely fell for it."" They all became a ""family"" in a community in London that already felt on the outside - and it was about to get even more tough. Both had HIV when they met, but neither were to know. While no-one knew it yet, the wave of this epidemic was about to hit. This video can not be played Terrence Higgins Trust patron and former Wales rugby player Gareth Thomas revealed he has HIV so he could ""empower people"" Within 18 months of their first meeting at Bangs nightclub on London's Tottenham Court Road, Terry had died. ""He never really talked about it,"" Rupert recalled. ""It was like he was a very passive witness to his own deterioration."" In the spring of 1982, Terry's illness became much more serious and he collapsed in London's Heaven nightclub and was rushed to hospital. Game-changer: 'I didn't know HIV drug existed' 'I had death threats after posting about my HIV' 'We were all Aids deniers - then it got real' ""Only family could visit,"" said Rupert. ""I said 'he doesn't have any family, I'm his boyfriend' so the nurses were cool with that, but the physicians didn't talk to me. 'Gay cancer' ""At the time, a gay newspaper ran this report... about what was then gay cancer and pneumonia. We had an idea that this thing was in America but nobody had any idea it was in Europe. ""I was pretty sure that's what Terry had. He'd gone downhill so quickly."" Terry died in St Thomas' Hospital on the banks of the River Thames - opposite his old workplace, the Palace of Westminster Rupert had been celebrating independence day with some American friends on 4 July 1982 when he popped in with some ""ice lollies, Lucozade and Tizer"" to see Terry. Those drinks remained undrunk. Terry died that evening. ""I knew very much that I had loved him - but I didn't know if he'd loved me,"" Rupert admitted. Film star Dame Judi Dench is a big supporter and patron of the Terrence Higgins Trust ""I had to ask a couple of his friends and they looked at me as though I was crazy because they said 'oh yeah, very, very much'. ""Just before he died, apparently he was calling out for me. It's a real regret that I was late. ""The impact that had on me for the rest of my life has been incredible - it changed my life. And hopefully I've done useful with it to help somebody else."" The Terrence Higgins Trust was formed in Martyn Butler's old flat in East London At the time, doctors were unsure how to diagnose or treat the new illness while there was fear within the community and wider public as to what this condition was. Within weeks of Terry's funeral, a group of pals who had nowhere to channel their grief and wanted to help fight this unknown illness formed a trust in Martyn's front room in Limehouse in East London. ""I had this sense that I'm expected to be dead already,"" recalled Rupert. ""I am expected to die. I expect myself to do die. What do I do? Do I just sit around and wait for this to happen or do I actually do something with the time I've got."" A new portrait of Terrence Higgins is now on display in the Welsh Parliament building in Cardiff Personalising the trust in Terry's memory, they thought that would give their cause greater impact. The Terrence Higgins Trust has since helped thousands and provided sexual health services like HIV testing, making it one of the world's oldest and leading HIV and Aids charities.

EasyJet chief operating officer resignsThe move comes after the airline has been criticised for flight cancellations and disruption to schedules.Business,"EasyJet's chief operating officer has resigned after a series of flight cancellations and disruption at the airline in recent weeks. The airline said Peter Bellew had left ""to pursue other business opportunities"" and wished him well. It comes after thousands of EasyJet flights have been cancelled - some at short notice. Trade union Unite last month criticised a ""lack of leadership"" at the airline and urged Mr Bellew to ""take control"". Announcing Mr Bellew's resignation, EasyJet chief executive Johan Lundgren said the airline was ""absolutely focused on delivering a safe and reliable operation this summer"". Flight cancellation plan aims to ease summer chaos He said the role of interim chief operations officer would be in the ""very capable hands of"" David Morgan ""who will provide strong leadership for the airline this summer"". Mr Morgan has been with EasyJet since 2016 and is currently director of flight operations. He had previously led overall operations at the airline, as interim chief operating officer in 2019. The aviation sector shed thousands of jobs during the pandemic, but is now struggling to meet the rebound in demand for travel. EasyJet has been one of the worst hit for cancellations in recent months. It has axed thousands of flights, including many on the day they were due to depart. Late last month it said it would be making some cancellations over the summer, to build in more resilience and in response to caps imposed by London Gatwick and Amsterdam Schiphol airports. It said this gave customers advance notice and potential to re-book. While it will have made use ofthe government's landing slot ""amnesty""as part of this plan, EasyJet said it would not be announcing any further cancellations this week. It said the last affected customers would be told on Monday. In optimistic quotes in EasyJet's late January trading update, its boss Johan Lundgren predicted ""a strong summer ahead"", with demand pushing capacity near to 2019 levels. Six months later, with Covid restrictions largely behind them, people want to go on holiday again. Demand doesn't appear to have been a problem. But ambitions have evidently had to be scaled back. Thousands of flights have had to be cancelled. Today, the airline's boss says a ""safe and reliable"" operation is the ""absolute"" focus. EasyJet is far from the only business affected by widespread issues hitting aviation at the moment - from staff shortages to industrial action. It hopes not to have to issue any further waves of cancellations, and points out it's still running up to 1,700 flights each day. However, it has undeniably been through a challenging time of late and must be hoping that a change at the top can herald a change in performance. It is understood just over 150,000 of the 160,000 EasyJet flights initially scheduled to run over July, August and September, will go ahead. This means roughly 10,000 have been cancelled - or about 6%. The airline said the majority of its flights were unaffected by the cancellations, with it continuing to operate up to 1,700 flights a day. However, unions representing EasyJet cabin crew in Spain have called a series of 24-hour strikes for July in a dispute over pay. The first of the strikes took place over the weekend, and a further six days of action are due later this month. Shares in EasyJet, which have fallen back to the lows of March 2020 at the start of the pandemic, were trading down almost 3% after news of Mr Bellew's departure - making it one of the biggest fallers on the FTSE 250 index. More cancellations from a raft of airlines are expected this week as the government has given carriers until Friday to announce changes to their schedules without facing a potential penalty. The move is an attempt to minimise disruption during the peak summer holiday season. Do you work at an airport? Do you have a summer holiday coming up? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

Barristers to strike every other week from August,"Barristers gathered outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London Criminal cases in courts across England and Wales face disruption for a second week as barristers pledge to extend their strike action into August. Rallies have taken outside the Royal Courts of Justice, in London, plus Liverpool and Birmingham Crown Courts. Members of the Criminal Bar Association have rejected the government's 15% pay offer, saying it will not kick in immediately or apply to existing cases. Ministers blame the strikes for worseninga backlog of 58,000 cases. But the Criminal Bar Association says long-term legal-aid cuts are the cause. The CBA is asking for a 25% rise in pay for legal aid work, representing people who could not otherwise afford lawyers. It says some junior barristers currently make less than the hourly minimum wage. Ministers say a typical criminal barrister would get Â£7,000 more a year under the offer, adding that before expenses, median earnings for criminal barristers in 2019-20 were Â£79,800, although it admits junior barristers often earn a fraction of this. Strike leaves defendants facing court delays Barristers walk out of courts over pay Criminal barristers vote to strike over pay rates The CBA's four weeks of action escalates to a three-day walk-out this week, increasing by one day a week to a five-day strike from 18 July - and from August, barristers will strike on alternate weeks. Ministers say the number of backlogged cases is coming down, due to government initiatives - but say the strikes will lead to more delays and more people waiting for justice. ""Our energetic efforts to tackle the courts backlog are working but the strike action by criminal barristers threatens all that progress, despite the very generous pay offer on the table,"" argues Justice Minister James Cartlidge. But the CBA says a 28% cut in legal aid fees over the past decade has forced barristers out of the sector, with their numbers down a quarter compared to five years ago. This video can not be played Two young lawyers share their concerns about the profession ""There are simply too few criminal justice barristers to prosecute, to defend and even to provide the judges the government relies on and the public expects to be there, to crack a record backlog and ensure victims of crime and the accused are not left in agonising limbo,"" said a CBA spokesperson. ""The criminal justice system has been grinding to a halt for a number of years, not because of us but because the government has simply mismanaged the system and underfunded it considerably,"" said CBA chairman Jo Sidhu. The CBA says its own analysis of government figures suggests that in the year to March 2022 more  than 1,000 criminal trials were postponed at the last moment because there was no prosecuting or defence barrister available. Solicitors working in the criminal justice system have told the BBC they face similar problems. ""We believe the years of underfunding have lead to a crisis in the criminal justice system,"" said Hashem Puri, president of the London Criminal Courts Solicitors Association. ""Large numbers of barristers and criminal solicitors are leaving the profession because of the low pay... ""Our members are considering taking similar action and joining the bar in days of action.""

"Go-slow fuel protests cause motorway delaysConvoys of protesters are driving slowly on motorways as they call for fuel duty to be cut.UKThalidomide survivors to get lifelong supportThere are 50 known survivors of the banned pregnancy drug in Scotland, most now in their 60s.Scotland politics","This video can not be played Watch: Motorways brought to a standstill by fuel price protesters More than a dozen protesters were arrested for driving too slowly during demonstrations on motorways in England, Wales and Scotland over fuel prices. The go-slow action mainly targeted three-lane motorways with convoys of vehicles crawling along two lanes - leaving the ""fast"" outside lane free. Twelve people were arrested during a protest on the M4, which led to the Prince of Wales Bridge, between England and Wales, being closed. Another man was arrested near the A38. Protesters, organised under the social media banner Fuel Price Stand Against Tax, drove in a series of convoys at 30mph (48.3km/h) to cause gridlock on major roads and motorways. Chief Superintendent Tom Harding from Gwent Police said people had been arrested for driving under 30mph for a ""prolonged amount of time"". The roads affected by disruption included: the M4 and Prince of Wales Bridge the M5 in Devon the M32 in Gloucestershire the A38 in Devon the M180 in Lincolnshire the A12 in Essex the A92 in Scotland the A64 near York Gwent Police said organisers of the protest had been given a legal notice to prevent them from blocking the bridge over the River Severn and from driving under 30mph. Ch Supt Harding said restrictions had been placed on the protest as otherwise ""emergency and critical services"" would have been restricted. Tariq Akram said other cars joined the convoy as it went by Tariq Akram said his was one of 50 vehicles making the 60-mile journey through Scunthorpe and Doncaster at 20mph. The Scunthorpe truck driver told the BBC his company had added Â£4,000 to its fuel bill in the past four months because of rising prices. ""The turnout was absolutely fantastic. There were 35 vehicles from our yard alone who took part,"" he said. ""At one point, I thought some cars wanted to overtake so I tried to let them by, then I realised they were joining in."" Police Scotland has told drivers to drive at an appropriate speed for the conditions Avon and Somerset Police said all protests in its area had finished and thanked the public for their patience in a tweet at 15:20 BST. Earlier, Devon and Cornwall Police said it was aware of a go-slow protest heading northbound from Exeter services on the M5. The force also said a further protest began on the A38 heading north from Ivybridge, where a man in his 50s was arrested after ignoring a warning about unsafe driving. ""Unfortunately we have had unsafe driving on the A38 including vehicles travelling at a dangerously low speed,"" a force spokesman said. Why is petrol so expensive in the UK? Fact vs fiction: Five tips for saving petrol money examined Steve Nash, who got stuck on the M5, said the protesters might be ""going about it the wrong way"" Steve Nash, who was delayed on the M5 by protesters as he drove to Exeter Airport to return a hire car, is hopeful the delay will not result in a penalty fee. ""I'm not sure what they're achieving - other than inconveniencing people,"" he said. ""I'm not critical of the sentiment behind what they're trying to do, I just think they're possibly going about it the wrong way."" The retired civil servant from Tiverton said his journey that would usually take 20 minutes took an hour on Monday. He said he felt the protesters should be ""stood outside parliament or writing to their MPs"". ""I think it's not affecting the people you need to actually protest, which is Parliament. The protesters have actually inconvenienced everyone else who is inconvenienced by high fuel prices."" Police Scotland said it had beenaware of protests on motorways and trunk roadsand urged motorists to drive at an appropriate speed for the road conditions. But the force had warned journey times could be longer than normal. In Lincolnshire, police blocked junction one between the M180 and M18 forcing protesters to remain on the former. West Yorkshire Police said a ""single tyre deflation device"" - also known as a ""stinger"" - had been deployed, but it was not used. West Mercia Police said some of the tactics used during a protest on the M54, which had ended by about 08:30 BST, had ""compromised the safety of other road users"" and said officers wouldtake action against those who committed traffic offences. A Facebook event called Stand Up to Fuel Prices, with more than 57,000 responses, had called for people to take their cars, lorries and tractors to cause roadblocks all over the country ""until there is change"". The organisers wrote that fuel costs were driving up other costs of living and said they hoped the more people that joined the protest, the sooner living costs would drop. Fuel prices have risen to record highs in recent weeks with figures from data firm Experian showing the average price of a litre of petrol at UK forecourts had hit 191.5p and 199.0p for diesel on Sunday. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said there did not appear to be any sign of retailers reducing forecourt prices, despite weekly wholesale costs having fallen for five weeks. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said he will carefully consider calls for a ""more substantial"" fuel duty cut after the 5p per litre reduction implemented in March failed to halt price rises. Rising fuel prices have been pushed even higher by the war in Ukraine, with Russia, one of the world's largest oil exporters, facing sanctions. A convoy of vehicles on the M180 in Lincolnshire Police escort vehicles across the Prince of Wales Bridge, which runs between England and Wales The government had said while it understands people are struggling with rising prices and have a right to protest, ""people's day-to-day lives should not be disrupted"" and warned traffic delays ""will only add to fuel use"". Howard Cox, founder of campaign group FairFuelUK, said other countries had cut fuel duty more than the UK and called for a reduction of at least 20p. While he said his organisation was not involved in the protests, he said there was an appetite for them - and if the government did not deliver on the issue there could be ""some serious escalation of protests"".

"Thalidomide survivors to get lifelong supportThere are 50 known survivors of the banned pregnancy drug in Scotland, most now in their 60s.Scotland politics","Thalidomide was banned as a morning sickness drug in 1961 after the danger it posed to babies was discovered Thalidomide survivors living in Scotland will receive lifelong financial support, the Scottish government has announced. Health Secretary Humza Yousaf said he hoped the commitment to provide grants would reassure those affected. There are 50 known survivors of the banned pregnancy drug living in Scotland, most now in their 60s. They are among thousands born with limb deformities after their mothers took thalidomide while pregnant. The drug was commonly used to treat morning sickness from 1958 to 1961. In 2013 the Scottish governmentcommitted Â£14.2m to help survivorsover a 10-year period, with the money going on health and living costs. Ministers have now extended that agreement, with grants to be allocated to survivors on a needs basis, as assessed by the Thalidomide Trust. Mr Yousaf said: ""This funding is used to give thalidomide survivors as much assistance as they need to maintain their independence. It has been a vital support in helping people adapt their homes and manage their pain. ""I hope this lifelong commitment to continue this support will reassure recipients and help them deal with any challenges they face."" David Fullerton from Loanhead in Midlothian is thalidomide impaired. He has a short left arm, and no wrists or thumbs. Now 60, he is relieved to feel some security. He told BBC Radio'sGood Morning Scotland programme: ""Myself and the cohort are all growing old together but deteriorating a little faster than normal on top of those original disabilities. ""It is a relief the Scottish government has recognised there is an ongoing need to support that extra cost to help us be independent for the rest of our lives, the last part of our lives."" He explained some of the costs. ""For myself, every item of clothing for my upper body needs to be adjusted so the adjustments can cost more than the piece of clothing. ""Cars have to be adjusted and adapted, homes need to be adapted. ""I can't really use normal gym equipment so I have to have a personal trainer come round and help set up equipment and strap me into machines, things that impact on almost every aspect of living."" David Fullerton is affected by thalidomide birth defects - he has a short left arm, and no wrists or thumbs Mr Fullerton does not see the commitment as compensation but as a mitigation of extra costs. He said his disabilities over the years had caused a lot of distress. ""My mother, my brothers and sisters, my partners have all been affected by it."" He added: ""Drug safety and medical safety is based on this disaster but it doesn't end for us. ""There is still a case against the German company which produced the drug in the first place."" Mr Fullerton would have liked to see some liability apportioned and said it would have been nice for it to have been settled right at the beginning. ""Right throughout our lives it has just been topping up, topping up,"" he said. ""And I have no doubt in 10 years' time when everyone is 70-73 there will be more complicated medical issues to be dealt with and more complicated independent living issues so it will need to be revisited. But it is a relief to have this support."" Deborah Jack, executive director of the Thalidomide Trust, said the latest funding announcement was ""fantastic and very welcome news"". She added: ""Sadly, as our beneficiaries age they are experiencing multiple health problems, in addition to their original thalidomide damage, and the costs of meeting their complex needs are significant. ""Many of them have been really anxious about the prospect of this much-needed funding coming to an end. ""We are really pleased that the Scottish government has recognised this by committing to lifetime financial support and also agreeing to review the level of funding regularly to ensure it is meeting their changing needs."" Scotland played a leading role in dealing with the impact of thalidomide in the past. In 1961, Edinburgh GP Ekke Kuenssberg and two colleagues were among the first to realise the danger it posed to babies in the womb. The city's Princess Margaret Rose Hospital became a world centre in helping young survivors and provided artificially-powered limbs they could control themselves.

""Cars have to be adjusted and adapted, homes need to be adapted. ""I can't really use normal gym equipment so I have to have a personal trainer come round and help set up equipment and strap me into machines, things that impact on almost every aspect of living."" David Fullerton is affected by thalidomide birth defects - he has a short left arm, and no wrists or thumbs Mr Fullerton does not see the commitment as compensation but as a mitigation of extra costs. He said his disabilities over the years had caused a lot of distress. ""My mother, my brothers and sisters, my partners have all been affected by it."" He added: ""Drug safety and medical safety is based on this disaster but it doesn't end for us. ""There is still a case against the German company which produced the drug in the first place."" Mr Fullerton would have liked to see some liability apportioned and said it would have been nice for it to have been settled right at the beginning. ""Right throughout our lives it has just been topping up, topping up,"" he said. ""And I have no doubt in 10 years' time when everyone is 70-73 there will be more complicated medical issues to be dealt with and more complicated independent living issues so it will need to be revisited. But it is a relief to have this support."" Deborah Jack, executive director of the Thalidomide Trust, said the latest funding announcement was ""fantastic and very welcome news"". She added: ""Sadly, as our beneficiaries age they are experiencing multiple health problems, in addition to their original thalidomide damage, and the costs of meeting their complex needs are significant. ""Many of them have been really anxious about the prospect of this much-needed funding coming to an end. ""We are really pleased that the Scottish government has recognised this by committing to lifetime financial support and also agreeing to review the level of funding regularly to ensure it is meeting their changing needs."" Scotland played a leading role in dealing with the impact of thalidomide in the past. In 1961, Edinburgh GP Ekke Kuenssberg and two colleagues were among the first to realise the danger it posed to babies in the womb. The city's Princess Margaret Rose Hospital became a world centre in helping young survivors and provided artificially-powered limbs they could control themselves.

We lost battle not the war - Ukraine governorCan we say how many people have died in Ukraine?What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?Teaching from the trenches in UkraineUkraine round-up: Russia takes Lysychansk and border city hit,"Russian shelling has laid waste to large areas of the city Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his defence minister to continue the offensive in Ukraine after Russia captured the city of Lysychansk. Mr Putin was shown on Russian TV calling on forces on other fronts to pursue their aims according to ""previously approved plans"". The capture means that all of Luhansk region is now in Russian hands. Earlier the region's Ukrainian governor said the city was abandoned so Russians would not destroy it from a distance. Soldiers have now moved to new fortified positions, Serhiy Haidai told the BBC. Losing the city and ceding control of Luhansk to Russia was painful, he said, but added: ""This is just one battle we have lost, but not the war."" He pleaded for more weapons from the West to offset the Russian advantage. President Volodymyr Zelensky has pledged that Ukrainian forces will return to retake Lysychansk ""thanks to the increase in the supply of modern weapons"". What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine? Russia has now stepped up its bombardment of cities in the neighbouring Donetsk region, with the areas around Sloviansk and the road between Lysychansk and Bakhmut in particular being targeted, according to Ukrainian forces. Together the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk form the industrial Donbas area. Mr Putin was seen telling Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu that troops who took part in the campaign to capture Luhansk should ""rest and develop their combat capabilities"". ""Other military units, including the East group and the West group, must carry out their tasks according to previously approved plans,"" he said, expressing the hope that on those fronts they would have similar success to that in Luhansk region. Just before he launched the invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, Mr Putin recognised all of Luhansk and Donetsk as independent states. Russian proxy forces began an insurgency there in 2014 - the year Russia also annexed the Crimean peninsula. Just over a week ago, Russian troops captured Severodonetsk - which Russian bombardment has reduced to ruins. Three Ukrainian soldiers who've served in the Donbas have described the fighting there as brutal. ""Russians like to destroy a city, a village, totally. Never mind who's there - Ukrainian civilians or military,"" Mark, a volunteer fighter just back from the front line in the Luhansk region, told me. Another soldier, Nikolai, told me he'd be lying if he didn't admit it was ""terrifying"". All three soldiers agree with Ukraine pulling back when its troops are outgunned: ""It's very hard to hold ground. It's a lot of deaths. There's nothing left there now anyway. No civilians. No city. They bombed it all."" They can't give details of casualties, but talked of ""so many"". ""People we studied with, shared food with, volunteers like us. Many are gone."" And yet, they insisted they would go back to the Donbas within days to fight on. Speaking about the decision to leave Lysychansk, Mr Haidai said: ""Our military could have held the city for a long time, but Russia currently has a huge advantage in artillery and ammunition. They would have simply destroyed the city from a distance, so there was no point in staying."" Mr Haidai said troops had now moved to positions in neighbouring Donetsk, but that 10,000 people remained in the city. In other developments: Ukraine needs $750bn for a recovery plan and Russian oligarchs should contribute to the cost, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal has told a reconstruction conference in Switzerland British Foreign Minister Liz Truss has called for a new Marshall Plan to rebuild Ukraine, in reference to the huge US aid programme for Europe after World War Two Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, told the conference that Russia wants to undermine Ukraine's existence, but it can emerge from the war as a stronger and more modern country Ukraine's military said it had raised the Ukrainian flag again on Snake Island, afterRussian troops left the tiny but strategic outcropin the Black Sea last week STOLEN GRAIN:Tracking where Russia takes Ukraine's grain ANALYSIS:Why Russia couldn't hold Snake Island FACT CHECKED:Russia's claims about shopping centre attack READ MORE:Full coverage of the crisis,external Ukraine war in maps: Ukraine's counter-offensive into Russian territory Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Surprise fall in inflation boosts interest rate cut hopes Why a small drop in inflation matters to you Family unaware missing sisters had ended Aberdeen tenancy What happens if TikTok is banned?

What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine?Teaching from the trenches in UkraineUkraine round-up: Russia takes Lysychansk and border city hit,"US officials say President Biden has given Ukraine permission to fire long-range ATACMS missiles into Russian territory. It is thought that the UK and France could follow suit by saying that Storm Shadow missiles can also be used against targets inside Russia. Western nations have now donated more than $100bn (Â£79bn) of military aid to Ukraine. The US has been the biggest source of military aid to Ukraine, including weapons, equipment and financial assistance. Between February 2022 and the end of August 2024, it gave $61.1bn (Â£48.4bn),according to German think tank the Kiel Institute,external. Germany has given $11.4bn (Â£9bn) in military aid, the UK $10.1bn (Â£8bn), Denmark $7bn (Â£5.6bn), and the Netherlands $5.5bn (Â£4.4bn). However, the Kiel Institute warnsthere could be a ""significant fall"" in aid to Ukraine in 2025,external, suggesting that President Trump could cut the US contribution when he returns to the White House in January. Germany is expectedto cut its military aid to Ukraine in 2025 by roughly half. What $61bn US aid boost could mean for Ukraine Nato pledges more advanced air defences to Ukraine Missiles and artillery Both Ukrainian and Russian forces have used artillery and guided missiles extensively, to prevent enemy forces advancing and to attack supply depots and command centres. Ukrainehas been using US-made ATACMS missiles against Russian forces inside Ukraine. These missiles have a range of about 190 miles (300km). It had not been allowed to fire them into Russian territory, for fear that doing so might drag the US and other Nato countries into the war. However,US officials say President Biden has lifted the ban, allowing ATACMS to be used to help Ukraine defend territory it occupies in the Russian Kursk region. The UK and France have supplied Ukraine withStorm Shadow or Scalp missiles, which have a maximum range of around 155 miles (250km). Both countries have banned Ukrainian forces from firing them into Russia, although Ukraine has also long asked to be allowed to do so. Ukraine's allies have also sent itmore than 80 multiple-launch rocket systems,,externalaccording to the Kiel Institute. These include the Himars system from the US and the M270 missile system from the UK. The Kiel Institute says they have also sent more than 500 field guns, including the M777 howitzer from the US. However, Russia has an advantage on the battlefield becauseits supply of artillery shells has been much greater than Ukraine's,external, according to the UK-based think tank, the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI). Fighter jets At the end of July, Ukraine's President Zelensky said its air forcehad taken delivery of the first batch of F-16 fighter jets from the West. He said many more were needed. Nato countries, including Belgium, Denmark, the Netherlands and Norway, have pledged to give Ukraine 65 or more of the US-made planes, which they had been planning to retire from their air forces. In August 2023, the US gave permission for F-16s to be sent to Ukraine. Since then, Western nations have been training Ukrainian pilots to fly them. Phillips O'Brien, Professor of Strategic Studies at St Andrews University says: ""Ukraine will be using the F-16s mostly for defence against air attacks."" The US-based Center for Strategic and International Studiessays they could eventually be given extra roles,external, such as attacking Russian air defence systems, command centres and supply depots, and engaging Russian aircraft in Ukrainian airspace. Air defence systems To counter Russian drone and missile attacks on Ukraine's cities and infrastructure, Western nations have sent it several types of air defence system. These range from the UK's short-range anti-aircraft weapon, Starstreak, to the Patriot missile system. Patriots are expensive to operate -one missile costs about $3m. The US and Norway have also provided the Nasams (National Advanced Surface-to-Air Missile System) for air defence, and Germany has offered the Iris-T. Munitions In July 2023, the US saidit had supplied cluster bombs to Ukraineto help dislodge Russian troops from defensive positions. These weapons, delivered mostly in artillery shells, scatter multiple bomblets,and are banned by more than 100 countries because of the risk they pose to civilians. Tanks In early 2023, Western nations agreed to send tanks to Ukraine. It was hoped they would enable its forces to breach Russian defensive lines in a counter-offensive. The UK provided 14 Challenger 2s. European nations have sent more than 200 German-made Leopard 1 and Leopard 2 tanks, according tofigures from the Kiel Institute,external. The US sent 31 of its M1 Abrams tanks, which are thought to be the most advanced in the world. Anti-tank weapons Western countries first responded to Russia's invasion in February 2022 by supplying Ukraine with defensive weapons to counter the enemy's armoured brigades. The US and UK supplied thousands of Javelin and Nlaw anti-tank missiles. These were considered crucial in stopping the advance of Russian forces on Kyiv. Drones Drones have been used extensively throughout the war, for surveillance, targeting, launching missiles and as ""kamikaze"" weapons. Turkey supplied missile-firing Bayraktar TB2 drones at the start of the conflict, the US has provided ""Switchblade"" kamikaze drones, and several countries have sent commercial surveillance drones, such as the Chinese-made DJI Mavic 3. In February 2024, the UK government said it would join a coalition of countriessupplying Ukraine with thousands of ""first person view"" drones,external, for observation and target spotting.

Pub numbers fall to lowest on record,"The number of pubs in England and Wales continues to fall, hitting its lowest level on record, according to new research. There were 39,970 pubs in June, down by more than 7,000 since 2012, said real estate consultancy Altus Group. After struggling through Covid the industry now faced soaring prices and higher energy costs, it warned. The government said it had slashed taxes to help, but industry groups urged it to do more. Over the last decade thousands of pubs have closed as younger people drink less, supermarkets sell cheaper alcohol and the industry complains of being too heavily taxed. But in 2019 figures from the Office for National Statisticssuggested the sector was turning a corneras it expanded for the first time in a decade. It declined again during the pandemic, however, as lockdowns forced pubs to shut or implement strict social distancing rules. Landlady gives up pub as energy bills near Â£30,000 Firms warn time is running out to save UK economy Worse to come for food price rises, warns industry According to Altus, 400 pubs in England and Wales closed last year and some 200 shut in the first half of 2022 as inflation started to eat into their profits. That brought the total number of pubs down to its lowest since Altus's records began in 2005. Robert Hayton, head of Altus in the UK, said: ""Whilst pubs proved remarkably resilient during the pandemic, they're now facing new headwinds grappling with the cost of doing business in a crisis through soaring energy costs, inflationary pressures and tax rises."" According to the research, the West Midlands saw the biggest number of pub closures in the first six months of 2022, with 28 shutting. It was followed by London and the East of England which both lost 24. Altus said that pubs which had ""disappeared"" from the communities they once served had either been demolished or converted for other purposes, meaning that they were ""lost forever"". The chief executive of UK Hospitality, Kate Nicholls, said the pub closure figures were ""truly shocking but will come as no surprise to many in the industry"". ""We need the government to take urgent steps to remove barriers to growth, help to tackle the cost crisis we're facing and support more people into work and training,"" she said. ""Without this help, we could see thousands more pubs lost from their communities in the next few years."" Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), said: ""When pubs are forced to close it's a huge loss to the local community, and these numbers paint a devastating picture of how pubs are being lost in villages, towns and cities across the country. ""As a sector we have just weathered the hardest two years on memory, and we now face the challenge of extreme rising costs,"" she added. ""It's essential that we receive relief to ease these pressures or we really do risk losing more pubs year on year."" According to research from the BBPA, the British Institute of Innkeeping and UK Hospitality, only 37% of hospitality businesses are currently turning a profit. Those surveyed said the rising costs of energy, goods and labour were most to blame. In the past week, pub bosses have also warned that summer rail strikes could hit their profits by further weakening consumer demand. The government said it could not control the ""global factors"" pushing up inflation but continued to support the hospitality sector. ""We've cut taxes for hundreds of thousands of businesses by increasing the Employment Allowance while slashing fuel duty,"" a spokesman said. ""We've also introduced a 50% business rates relief for eligible High Street businesses and prevented bill increases by freezing the business rates multiplier, saving businesses Â£4.6bn over the next five years.""

Catherine EvansBBC News Isabella said she had a panic attack after escaping A 13-year-old Harry Styles fan has described how she escaped
from the Fields shopping centre by climbing onto a roof with her grandmother. Isabella Hjertholm from Odense, Denmark, told the BBC: âWhen
we saw people running out of the cinema, at first I didnât think it was
anything serious, until I heard people say somebody were shooting."" âI didnât really know where to exit since I donât know the
mall that well, so I just followed a big group going to some type of rooftop,
and luckily we found an emergency exit,â she said. They ran as far away from the centre as they could, before phoning Isabella's mother and
grandfather, who were hiding in some toilets at the shopping centre. âWe waited at a gas station where we met with my mom and
grandpa later, and then we took a taxi back home,"" she said. ""I was traumatised and really
scared to go anywhere near Fields, plus my mom didnât let me go back there because it
didn't feel safe."" ""When I got back home to my grandma and grandpa I
began having a panic attack... I was really scared,"" she said. Isabella added that she was disappointed that she wouldnât be able to see Harry Styles, but was relieved to find out the show had been cancelled. ""It was the absolute right decision to make. Right now Iâm
hoping for a new date for Harry Styles concert,"" she said. ""I am very thankful
that me and my family are alive. I feel for those who have lost somebody."" Adrienne MurrayReporting from Copenhagen Crisis assistance points and counselling are being offered to the public in Copenhagen today. Only a couple of days ago, the Tour de France started here and there was a celebratory mood as spectators lined the streets. Itâs still unclear how the suspect obtained the murder weapon, and police say they are reviewing social media posts where he posed with weapons. Strict firearm controls are in place and potential gun-owners must pass a background check before being eligible for a licence. Although it's thought the suspect acted alone, police are keeping a visible presence across the capital. The attack in Denmark comes less than two weeks after agunman opened fire in Oslo, in neighbouring Norway, and Norwegian PM Jonas Gahr Stoere says he understands people's fears - but leaders are doing ""everything we can to keep us safe [sic]"". ""This is the most important task for the government at any time. And then each of us must take care of those around us and extend a hand to those who are now extra scared,"" he says in a statement, adding: There is still a lot we don't know about why the perpetrators in Oslo and Copenhagen committed the terrible acts, but regardless of the motive and background, our answer must be clear: we stand together in the face of violence and hatred. We are strengthened in our faith in community and love.""  Gahr Stoere also says Scandinavian countries are working to strengthen the goal of ""creating safe communities that prevent mental illness and radicalization"", though he doesn't give any detail on what's actually being done. ""My thoughts are with the victims, their relatives and to all those who are currently working to save lives and keep the population safe,"" the leader adds. Adrienne MurrayReporting from Copenhagen Dozens of heavily armed officers have been standing guard outside the Fieldâs shopping centre all morning, while investigators have been filing in and out. The steps to the main entrance remain cordoned off with tape, and police vehicles line the street outside. This is a smart office district on the outskirts of Copenhagen, but today the surroundings are quiet. At the weekend this area would have been particularly busy. The mall is a popular spot for families and young people, and at the time of the shooting, thousands of music fans were making their way to the Royal Arena concert hall, to see Harry Styles perform. For this small Nordic country, where gun violence is rare and mass shootings are almost unheard of, Sundayâs events are deeply shocking. A 16-year-old girl Harry Styles fan who was injured in Sunday's shooting has described how she came face to face with the gunman. The Swedish national, who is in a stable condition, spoke to Swedish media outlet Kristiansbladet from her hospital bed this morning. She said she's waiting to have fragments and a bullet removed from her body. The teenager was due to attend the Harry Styles concert nearby and had only been in the centre for a few minutes when the gunman opened fire. She managed to run away before she could feel a heat spread and heard a bang. ""Then I realised I had been hit,"" she said. ""I turned my head and saw the perpetrator for a few seconds."" Despite being hit, she managed to escape, getting help from people and ambulance crews outside the centre. More than 100 people are said to have contacted the Red Cross' victim counselling service in Denmark on Sunday night after the shooting at Field's shopping centre. Mikkel Wendelboe Toft, a consultant in national preparedness at the Red Cross, tells Danish news agency Ritzau that the service is hearing from people who've suffered ""great, violent experiences"". ""These are people who have been in direct visual contact in the moment out there,"" he's quoted as saying, adding that those who get away can often be left traumatised. ""There are people who have had escape experiences and have had to run away with children under their arms or have hidden in the centre."" Earlier, eyewitness Maximillian von Rentelndescribed his ""terrifying"" experienceof being just outside the mall when gunfire begun. He said dozens of people, including him, then ran as fast as they could to the nearest point of safety. This video can not be played People flee Field's shopping centre following the attack The shooting was carried out at Field's shopping centre, a popular destination for families and young Danes We've heard lots about the fallout from yesterday's gun attack in Copenhagen, but just how common is this kind of ambush in Denmark? The short answer is not very. The last time a militant attack was carried out in the Scandinavian country was February 2015, when a 22-year-old man opened fire on two separate occasions across the same day in Copenhagen. He killed two people in total and wounded six police officers. The perpetrator began shooting at the Krudttoenden cultural centre, during a freedom of speech event, before going on to shoot someone outside a Jewish synagogue in the city centre. He was eventually shot dead by police. At the time, local and international media branded it the ""worst attack on Danish soil for decades,external"". Betty Kandindima, from the Danish Broadcasting Corporation in
Copenhagen, told BBC Radio 5 Live earlier that the main difference between the two incidents was the police's ability to stop the suspect this time around. With that incident [in 2015], the suspect was walking around in the streets of Copenhagen for quite some time which meant the police actually had to barricade most of the city centre, whereasâ¦ itâs [this latest attack] in the outskirts of Copenhagen, approximately 10km from the city centre, which meant that this time around the police they had an easier time cutting off the area to find the suspect."" Betty Kandindima A picture has emerged of the alleged gunman inside Field's mall. It shows a man wearing shorts and a short-sleeved dark top, carrying what appears to be a weapon. The picture is from a video, which shows the man stopping momentarily, resting the apparent weapon on his shoulder, before starting to run through the shopping complex. Officials have just been holding a press conference outside the Rigshospitalet, where three of the seriously injured victims were taken. They were given ""life-saving treatment"" very quickly, chief physician Anders Damm said, according to the Jyllands-Posten newspaper. Of the three being treated there, two are in a stable condition. The third remains in a critical condition but further details were not given. A fourth gunshot victim is being treated at the Herlev Hospital, but is reported not to be in a critical condition. More now from Copenhagen's police chief, who has been explaining how the shooter targeted victims at random. Soeren Thomassen said police do not believe the attack was an act of terror and that the suspect has a history of mental health issues. ""It is important for me to underline that in the work we've been doing throughout the night there is nothing that indicates that the suspect that we apprehended has been together with others or has been helped by others. ""Our assessment is that the victims are random victims. That it is not motivated by gender or anything else."" British singer Harry Styles has said he is ""heartbroken"" following yesterday's deadly shopping centre attack in Copenhagen, which took place less than a mile from where he was due to play to fans on Sunday evening. The 28-year-old former One Direction star's concert was cancelled following the attack. Many fans had already gathered at the Royal Arena when the venue was evacuated. Posting to his verified Twitter account, Styles shared his love for the Danish capital and its residents, saying that he was ""heartbroken"" at the news. ""Iâm devastated for the victims, their families, and everyone hurting. ""Iâm sorry we couldnât be together. Please look after each other."" Allow Twitter content?

Police say the shooter was armed with a rifle, a pistol and a knife, and while the guns are not believed to be illegal, the suspect did not have a licence for them. But what are Denmark's gun laws? Denmark has restrictive gun laws that are regulated by the Ministry of Justice and the European Commission. Civilians are banned from owning full automatic firearms, while semi-automatic weapons and handguns are only allowed with special authorisation, according to Gun Policy, a group focused on gun control. Applicants for a gun ownerâs licence are required to establish a genuine reason to possess a firearm, for example hunting or target shooting. An applicant for a licence must pass a background check which considers criminal and mental health records. Eyewitness Maximillian von Renteln says police boarded a bus he escaped to, causing many to panic Let's hear from an eyewitness now. Maximillian von Renteln, who says he was ""just outside"" the
Field's shopping centre yesterday when he heard loud gun shots, has described the attack as terrifying. ""At
the time, I didnât think they were gunshots but just a while after I saw people
running out â and I instinctively did the same,"" he tells the BBC. Citing footage he captured on his mobile phone, Maximillian adds that a bus he managed to escape to was later boarded by armed police who instructed passengers to put their hands in the air. A man with a backpack, sitting at the back of the bus, was searched but officers found nothing and soon went on their way. âEveryone was in shock, no one knew what was happening. There were kids on board,"" Maximillian says. Despite this, he insists that the police did a good - and swift - job. ""Iâm happy with the police and how quickly they respondedâ¦ especially when you compare it to asituation like the [shooting] in Texas recently.â Danish journalist Lone Thelis says gun laws in the country are strict, leaving many puzzled about yesterday's attack In the last few minutes, Danish journalist Lone Thelis has been speaking to the BBC, saying the mood today in Copenhagen is one of ""shock and great sadness"". There is also ""disbelief"" that such an attack could take place in Denmark, she says. Asked why the 22-year-old gunman might have targeted the Field's shopping centre, Lone says details are still unknown. But, she adds, police in Denmark ""raided"" an apartment in the area last night and believe it to be the ""perpetrator's"" - meaning the explanation could be as simple as geography. Copenhagen has ""pretty strict"" gun laws, she adds, which is why many are so confused by yesterday's attack. ""You can't just go into a shop and get yourself a gun, you need to have permission. If you need a rifle for hunting, for instance, you need to do an exam,"" she says. ""That's definitely something the police will be interested in finding out - how did [the gunman] get the weapon?"" Sunday's attack took place at one of Denmark's biggest shopping centres. The Field's multi-storey shopping mall in the south of Copenhagen has more than 140 shops and restaurants and is located on the outskirts of the capital, near a subway line that connects it to the city centre. Less than a mile away is the Royal Arena, the 17,000-capacity venue where Harry Styles was due to perform on Sunday before the show was cancelled. There is a high school in the vicinity of the shopping centre, as well as a large student housing block where hundreds of young people on university exchange programmes live. Copenhagen airport is a short train ride away, as is the Ãresund Bridge, which connects Denmark to the Swedish city of MalmÃ¶. Footage on social media shows scenes of panic as people flee gunfire inside the shopping centre. You might find the content upsetting. This video can not be played The three people killed in Sunday's shooting have been identified as a Danish woman and man, both aged 17, and a 47-year-old Russian citizen residing in Denmark, Danish police say. Another four were injured in the shooting: two Danish women, aged 19 and 40, and two Swedish citizens, a 50-year-old man and a 16-year-old girl, Copenhagen police chief Soeren Thomassen says. He told reporters that police do not believe the attack was terror-related. Videos of the suspect circulating on social media are believed to be authentic, police say. The man can be seen posing with weapons, mimicking suicide gestures and talking about psychiatric medication ""that does not work"". More now from a press conference being held by police in Copenhagen. The city's police chief, Soeren Thomassen, says the suspect was known to mental health services. ""Our suspect is also known among psychiatric services, beyond that I do not wish to comment,"" Thomassen says. The victims appeared to have been randomly targeted and there was nothing to indicate it was an act of terror, he adds. Four people, including two Swedish citizens, are in critical
condition but stable after being hit by gunshots in the shooting on Sunday, where three people
were killed, the police chief says. Danish police say there is no indication that Sunday's shooting was an act of terror. The suspect had a history of mental health issues, they say. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Pub numbers fall to lowest on recordThe number of pubs in England and Wales has fallen by 7,000 in a decade, research suggests.","The number of pubs in England and Wales continues to fall, hitting its lowest level on record, according to new research. There were 39,970 pubs in June, down by more than 7,000 since 2012, said real estate consultancy Altus Group. After struggling through Covid the industry now faced soaring prices and higher energy costs, it warned. The government said it had slashed taxes to help, but industry groups urged it to do more. Over the last decade thousands of pubs have closed as younger people drink less, supermarkets sell cheaper alcohol and the industry complains of being too heavily taxed. But in 2019 figures from the Office for National Statisticssuggested the sector was turning a corneras it expanded for the first time in a decade. It declined again during the pandemic, however, as lockdowns forced pubs to shut or implement strict social distancing rules. Landlady gives up pub as energy bills near Â£30,000 Firms warn time is running out to save UK economy Worse to come for food price rises, warns industry According to Altus, 400 pubs in England and Wales closed last year and some 200 shut in the first half of 2022 as inflation started to eat into their profits. That brought the total number of pubs down to its lowest since Altus's records began in 2005. Robert Hayton, head of Altus in the UK, said: ""Whilst pubs proved remarkably resilient during the pandemic, they're now facing new headwinds grappling with the cost of doing business in a crisis through soaring energy costs, inflationary pressures and tax rises."" According to the research, the West Midlands saw the biggest number of pub closures in the first six months of 2022, with 28 shutting. It was followed by London and the East of England which both lost 24. Altus said that pubs which had ""disappeared"" from the communities they once served had either been demolished or converted for other purposes, meaning that they were ""lost forever"". The chief executive of UK Hospitality, Kate Nicholls, said the pub closure figures were ""truly shocking but will come as no surprise to many in the industry"". ""We need the government to take urgent steps to remove barriers to growth, help to tackle the cost crisis we're facing and support more people into work and training,"" she said. ""Without this help, we could see thousands more pubs lost from their communities in the next few years."" Emma McClarkin, chief executive of the British Beer and Pub Association (BBPA), said: ""When pubs are forced to close it's a huge loss to the local community, and these numbers paint a devastating picture of how pubs are being lost in villages, towns and cities across the country. ""As a sector we have just weathered the hardest two years on memory, and we now face the challenge of extreme rising costs,"" she added. ""It's essential that we receive relief to ease these pressures or we really do risk losing more pubs year on year."" According to research from the BBPA, the British Institute of Innkeeping and UK Hospitality, only 37% of hospitality businesses are currently turning a profit. Those surveyed said the rising costs of energy, goods and labour were most to blame. In the past week, pub bosses have also warned that summer rail strikes could hit their profits by further weakening consumer demand. The government said it could not control the ""global factors"" pushing up inflation but continued to support the hospitality sector. ""We've cut taxes for hundreds of thousands of businesses by increasing the Employment Allowance while slashing fuel duty,"" a spokesman said. ""We've also introduced a 50% business rates relief for eligible High Street businesses and prevented bill increases by freezing the business rates multiplier, saving businesses Â£4.6bn over the next five years.""

You can read more in ourlatest news story. These live updates have been brought to you by Jeremy Gahagan, George Wright, Sam Hancock and Catherine Evans. Catherine EvansBBC News Isabella said she had a panic attack after escaping A 13-year-old Harry Styles fan has described how she escaped
from the Fields shopping centre by climbing onto a roof with her grandmother. Isabella Hjertholm from Odense, Denmark, told the BBC: âWhen
we saw people running out of the cinema, at first I didnât think it was
anything serious, until I heard people say somebody were shooting."" âI didnât really know where to exit since I donât know the
mall that well, so I just followed a big group going to some type of rooftop,
and luckily we found an emergency exit,â she said. They ran as far away from the centre as they could, before phoning Isabella's mother and
grandfather, who were hiding in some toilets at the shopping centre. âWe waited at a gas station where we met with my mom and
grandpa later, and then we took a taxi back home,"" she said. ""I was traumatised and really
scared to go anywhere near Fields, plus my mom didnât let me go back there because it
didn't feel safe."" ""When I got back home to my grandma and grandpa I
began having a panic attack... I was really scared,"" she said. Isabella added that she was disappointed that she wouldnât be able to see Harry Styles, but was relieved to find out the show had been cancelled. ""It was the absolute right decision to make. Right now Iâm
hoping for a new date for Harry Styles concert,"" she said. ""I am very thankful
that me and my family are alive. I feel for those who have lost somebody."" Adrienne MurrayReporting from Copenhagen Crisis assistance points and counselling are being offered to the public in Copenhagen today. Only a couple of days ago, the Tour de France started here and there was a celebratory mood as spectators lined the streets. Itâs still unclear how the suspect obtained the murder weapon, and police say they are reviewing social media posts where he posed with weapons. Strict firearm controls are in place and potential gun-owners must pass a background check before being eligible for a licence. Although it's thought the suspect acted alone, police are keeping a visible presence across the capital. The attack in Denmark comes less than two weeks after agunman opened fire in Oslo, in neighbouring Norway, and Norwegian PM Jonas Gahr Stoere says he understands people's fears - but leaders are doing ""everything we can to keep us safe [sic]"". ""This is the most important task for the government at any time. And then each of us must take care of those around us and extend a hand to those who are now extra scared,"" he says in a statement, adding: There is still a lot we don't know about why the perpetrators in Oslo and Copenhagen committed the terrible acts, but regardless of the motive and background, our answer must be clear: we stand together in the face of violence and hatred. We are strengthened in our faith in community and love.""  Gahr Stoere also says Scandinavian countries are working to strengthen the goal of ""creating safe communities that prevent mental illness and radicalization"", though he doesn't give any detail on what's actually being done. ""My thoughts are with the victims, their relatives and to all those who are currently working to save lives and keep the population safe,"" the leader adds. Adrienne MurrayReporting from Copenhagen Dozens of heavily armed officers have been standing guard outside the Fieldâs shopping centre all morning, while investigators have been filing in and out. The steps to the main entrance remain cordoned off with tape, and police vehicles line the street outside. This is a smart office district on the outskirts of Copenhagen, but today the surroundings are quiet. At the weekend this area would have been particularly busy. The mall is a popular spot for families and young people, and at the time of the shooting, thousands of music fans were making their way to the Royal Arena concert hall, to see Harry Styles perform. For this small Nordic country, where gun violence is rare and mass shootings are almost unheard of, Sundayâs events are deeply shocking. A 16-year-old girl Harry Styles fan who was injured in Sunday's shooting has described how she came face to face with the gunman. The Swedish national, who is in a stable condition, spoke to Swedish media outlet Kristiansbladet from her hospital bed this morning. She said she's waiting to have fragments and a bullet removed from her body. The teenager was due to attend the Harry Styles concert nearby and had only been in the centre for a few minutes when the gunman opened fire. She managed to run away before she could feel a heat spread and heard a bang. ""Then I realised I had been hit,"" she said. ""I turned my head and saw the perpetrator for a few seconds."" Despite being hit, she managed to escape, getting help from people and ambulance crews outside the centre. More than 100 people are said to have contacted the Red Cross' victim counselling service in Denmark on Sunday night after the shooting at Field's shopping centre. Mikkel Wendelboe Toft, a consultant in national preparedness at the Red Cross, tells Danish news agency Ritzau that the service is hearing from people who've suffered ""great, violent experiences"". ""These are people who have been in direct visual contact in the moment out there,"" he's quoted as saying, adding that those who get away can often be left traumatised. ""There are people who have had escape experiences and have had to run away with children under their arms or have hidden in the centre."" Earlier, eyewitness Maximillian von Rentelndescribed his ""terrifying"" experienceof being just outside the mall when gunfire begun. He said dozens of people, including him, then ran as fast as they could to the nearest point of safety. This video can not be played People flee Field's shopping centre following the attack The shooting was carried out at Field's shopping centre, a popular destination for families and young Danes We've heard lots about the fallout from yesterday's gun attack in Copenhagen, but just how common is this kind of ambush in Denmark? The short answer is not very. The last time a militant attack was carried out in the Scandinavian country was February 2015, when a 22-year-old man opened fire on two separate occasions across the same day in Copenhagen. He killed two people in total and wounded six police officers. The perpetrator began shooting at the Krudttoenden cultural centre, during a freedom of speech event, before going on to shoot someone outside a Jewish synagogue in the city centre. He was eventually shot dead by police. At the time, local and international media branded it the ""worst attack on Danish soil for decades,external"". Betty Kandindima, from the Danish Broadcasting Corporation in
Copenhagen, told BBC Radio 5 Live earlier that the main difference between the two incidents was the police's ability to stop the suspect this time around. With that incident [in 2015], the suspect was walking around in the streets of Copenhagen for quite some time which meant the police actually had to barricade most of the city centre, whereasâ¦ itâs [this latest attack] in the outskirts of Copenhagen, approximately 10km from the city centre, which meant that this time around the police they had an easier time cutting off the area to find the suspect."" Betty Kandindima A picture has emerged of the alleged gunman inside Field's mall. It shows a man wearing shorts and a short-sleeved dark top, carrying what appears to be a weapon. The picture is from a video, which shows the man stopping momentarily, resting the apparent weapon on his shoulder, before starting to run through the shopping complex. Officials have just been holding a press conference outside the Rigshospitalet, where three of the seriously injured victims were taken. They were given ""life-saving treatment"" very quickly, chief physician Anders Damm said, according to the Jyllands-Posten newspaper. Of the three being treated there, two are in a stable condition. The third remains in a critical condition but further details were not given. A fourth gunshot victim is being treated at the Herlev Hospital, but is reported not to be in a critical condition. More now from Copenhagen's police chief, who has been explaining how the shooter targeted victims at random. Soeren Thomassen said police do not believe the attack was an act of terror and that the suspect has a history of mental health issues. ""It is important for me to underline that in the work we've been doing throughout the night there is nothing that indicates that the suspect that we apprehended has been together with others or has been helped by others. ""Our assessment is that the victims are random victims. That it is not motivated by gender or anything else."" British singer Harry Styles has said he is ""heartbroken"" following yesterday's deadly shopping centre attack in Copenhagen, which took place less than a mile from where he was due to play to fans on Sunday evening. The 28-year-old former One Direction star's concert was cancelled following the attack. Many fans had already gathered at the Royal Arena when the venue was evacuated. Posting to his verified Twitter account, Styles shared his love for the Danish capital and its residents, saying that he was ""heartbroken"" at the news. ""Iâm devastated for the victims, their families, and everyone hurting. ""Iâm sorry we couldnât be together. Please look after each other."" Allow Twitter content?

Police say the shooter was armed with a rifle, a pistol and a knife, and while the guns are not believed to be illegal, the suspect did not have a licence for them. But what are Denmark's gun laws? Denmark has restrictive gun laws that are regulated by the Ministry of Justice and the European Commission. Civilians are banned from owning full automatic firearms, while semi-automatic weapons and handguns are only allowed with special authorisation, according to Gun Policy, a group focused on gun control. Applicants for a gun ownerâs licence are required to establish a genuine reason to possess a firearm, for example hunting or target shooting. An applicant for a licence must pass a background check which considers criminal and mental health records. Eyewitness Maximillian von Renteln says police boarded a bus he escaped to, causing many to panic Let's hear from an eyewitness now. Maximillian von Renteln, who says he was ""just outside"" the
Field's shopping centre yesterday when he heard loud gun shots, has described the attack as terrifying. ""At
the time, I didnât think they were gunshots but just a while after I saw people
running out â and I instinctively did the same,"" he tells the BBC. Citing footage he captured on his mobile phone, Maximillian adds that a bus he managed to escape to was later boarded by armed police who instructed passengers to put their hands in the air. A man with a backpack, sitting at the back of the bus, was searched but officers found nothing and soon went on their way. âEveryone was in shock, no one knew what was happening.

Russia to push further into Donbas after taking key region,"Leaders from dozens of countries and international organisations are meeting in Switzerland to create a plan to rebuild Ukraine after the war The reconstruction effort has been likened to the US-led Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe after World War Two It will cost $750bn for Ukraine to recover and Russia's invasion has caused $100bn of direct damage to infrastructure, PM Denys Shmyhal says On the ground, Russia will try to take full control of Donbas in eastern Ukraine after seizing the key region of Luhansk, Ukraine's regional governor says Russian forces have captured the eastern city of Lysychansk, and claimed control of the wider Luhansk region President Putin has congratulated Russian troops on ""liberating"" the area; Ukraine's President Zelensky has vowed to retake Luhansk Moscow has accused Ukraine of targeting civilians in a missile strike against the Russian city of Belgorod - but Kyiv has dismissed that claim Edited by Claire Heald We're wrapping up our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for the day. Here are the main headlines: Ukraine Recovery Conference: In other developments:  That's it from us. Today's live page was written by Sam Hancock, George Wright, Catherine Evans, James Harness, Victoria Lindrea, Alexandra FouchÃ© and Malu Cursino. Our editors were Jeremy Gahagan, Rob Corp, Heather Sharp and Claire Heald. The archbishop of Russia's Belgorod western region has called for an end to the ""bloodshed on Ukrainian soil"" -  in a rare display of public opposition to the Kremlin. His remarks - reported in the Russian media -followed a series of missile strikes on the Russian cities of Belgorod and Kursk on Ukraine's border- which Moscow has blamed on Kyiv. ""Last night, missiles from the armed forces of Ukraine hit sleeping Belgorod people in residential areas,"" the archbishop wrote, in a statement posted on the church's official website. ""Among the dead were residents of [Ukraine's] Kharkiv region who came to seek shelter from the war in peaceful Belgorod. ""We call for a special prayer for the repose of the deceased and for the recovery of the injured; for an end to the bloodshed that is taking place on Ukrainian soil, but which today has also reached our homes."" Steve RosenbergBBC Russia editor, reporting from Belgorod The site of the blast in Belgorod Developments now on the Russian side of the border with Ukraine... In her fifth floor apartment in the Russian city of Belgorod, Lidiya tells me of her narrow escape. ""At 10 past three on Sunday morning I was woken by a blinding flash and a loud explosion. I ran onto my balcony and saw a giant ball of flames heading towards the building. ""I ran inside. Suddenly all my windows shattered. ""Down below I heard shouting and crying. I could see rescuers digging people out of the rubble and carrying away the bodies."" Russia accusesUkraine of launching three missiles at Belgorod. Ukrainian officials have denied it. But whatever it was that exploded in this southern city, the emergency has completely undermined Moscow's claim that it ordered troops into Ukraine to make Russia safer. In reality, the security situation in Belgorod, and other Russian regions near the Ukrainian border, has deteriorated since the invasion. ""This is the first time something like this has happened in the city,"" Lidiya tells me. ""There was no shelling in the city of Belgorod half a year ago."" Local officials say four civilians were killed in the explosion and dozens of houses damaged. Across the border the scale of destruction has been far greater. Since the start of the Russian invasion, thousands of civilians have been killed in Ukraine and some cities have been reduced to rubble by repeated shelling. ""We need to live in peace with Ukraine. We always used to,"" Lidiya tells me. ""So many of us have relatives in Ukraine. And there are many Ukrainians living here."" Most of the people I speak to in Belgorod are not so conciliatory.

In a speech to the conference, Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal says the confiscated assets of Russia and its oligarchs should be used to rebuild his country. Shmyhal says Russia should be held accountable for the destruction caused by the war. This video can not be played WATCH: Ursula von der Leyen says Ukraine can emerge from the war a stronger country Speaking at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Switzerland, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen says the Kremlin wants to undermine the existence of Ukraine. However, Ukraine can emerge from the war as a stronger and more modern country, she says. As we've been reporting this afternoon, the Ukraine Recovery Conference is under way in Lugano, Switzerland. World leaders and international organisations have been discussing how they will support Ukraine in its recovery and reconstruction, following Russia's invasion on 24 February. Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Ukraine needs $750bn for a recovery plan. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said the EU has mobilised around â¬6.2bn (Â£5.3bn) in financial support for Ukraine since the start of Russia's invasion. But, also on the agenda, are anti-corruption pledges and demands from Ukraine. Swiss President Ignazio Cassis, co-host of the conference, said: ""It is crucial that these efforts continue unwaveringly, especially in the fight against corruption, improving transparency and the independence of the judiciary, and that they are not stalled by the war."" A side event to discuss anti-corruption strategies has been organised alongside the two-day conference. This is co-hosted by the EU Anti-Corruption Initiative (EUACI), which was set up in 2017 with the aim of reducing corruption in Ukraine at the national and local level. Mathias Cormann, secretary general of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) spoke at the Ukraine Recovery Conference. He said Ukraine was working closely with the OECD in an anti-corruption initiative that aims to tackle bribery and other forms of corruption in the country. This video can not be played President Putin will find ""new targets"" if Russia is not stopped in its war against Ukraine, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson tells MPs in the House of Commons. He says the goal must be for ""our Ukrainians friends"" to win and that Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelensky must have the ""strength to finish this war"". He's been updating MPs after the Nato summit in Madrid last week. Leaders of the G7 group of rich nations are looking at the possibility of getting much-need Ukrainian grain out of the country ""in smaller quantities"" via the River Danube river, UK PM Boris Johnson also tells MPs. The World Trade Organization said a food crisis as a result of the Ukraine war could last for years without intervention. Millions of tonnes of grain are sitting in warehouses and Ukrainian ports that cannot be exported due to a combination of anti-ship mines in the Black Sea and a Russian naval blockade. Read more on that here. Johnson says the UK is not looking at breaching the Montreux Convention - an international agreement that regulates maritime traffic in the Black Sea - and there are alternative solutions that don't involve the presence of British warships. Johnson says getting grain out of Ukraine ""might involve a tougher approach, but what we are also looking at is the possibility of using the rivers, using the Danube in particular"". But, he adds, this might have to be done ""in smaller quantities"" rather than ""a giant maritime convoy"" using the Black Sea. Away from the action in Ukraine and in diplomatic moves, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been updating the MPs in the House of Commons after he spent the last week attending international summits in Africa and Europe, where the conflict in Ukraine dominated. Here's what he had to say:  Labour leader Keir Starmer replied: Sarah RainsfordEastern Europe correspondent, reporting from Kyiv (l-r) Mark, âSkifâ and Nikolai: mechanic, businessman and medic - turned soldiers Three Ukrainian soldiers whoâve served in the Donbas have described the fighting there as
brutal. They say the Russian troops they faced are far more experienced and
ruthless than those who tried to take Kyiv in the spring. âRussians like to destroy a city, a village, totally. Never mind whoâs
there - Ukrainian civilians or military,â Mark, a volunteer fighter just
back from the front line in the Luhansk region, told me. He said Russia was using its overwhelming firepower to ""wipe out"" villages in its advance, leaving the Ukrainians with little cover. Another soldier,
Nikolai, told me heâd be lying if he didnât admit it was ""terrifying"". They asked
for more support, more weapons. All three soldiers agree with Ukraine pulling back when its troops are
outgunned: âItâs very hard to hold ground. Itâs a lot of deaths. Thereâs
nothing left there now anyway. No civilians. No city. They bombed it all."" They canât give details of casualties, but talked of ""so many"". âPeople
we studied with, shared food with, volunteers like us. Many are gone.â And yet, they insisted they would go back to the Donbas within days to fight
on. âWe want payback,â said Nikolai. âAnd we want to protect our
families, our friends, from the terrible things that Russians do with our civilians.
[What happened in] Irpin, Hostemel, Bucha... we canât let it happen again.â Sophie WilliamsReporting from Kyiv Turning to the situation on the ground in that region, Serhiy Haidai, head of Luhansk regional administration, says that more than 10,000 people are left in Lysychansk in eastern Ukraine. He made the remarks during an interview with Ukrainian media. Lysychansk is the latest city to have been taken by Russian troops. Ukrainian military said that after heavy fighting, defending forces were forced to withdraw from their positions. Russian cosmonauts on the ISS held the flag of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic In March, not long after Russia invaded Ukraine, three Russian cosmonauts boarded the International Space Station wearing yellow and blue, in what many perceived as a show of support for Ukraine. They were warmly welcomed on board, hugging and greeting their  American, Russian and German fellow crew members. The Russian space agency denied the claims. ""Sometimes yellow is just yellow,"" said the Roscosmos space agency at the time. But now Denis Matveyev, Oleg Artemyev and Sergey Korsakov have been pictured celebrating Russia's
capture of the last major city in the eastern Ukrainian region of Luhansk. Many thought the team were showing solidarity with Ukraine in March, although the Russian space agency denied this The agency posted pictures of the three men smiling as they held up flags of Russia's proxies in eastern Ukraine, the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic and Donetsk People's Republic. ""This is a long-awaited day that the residents of the occupied areas of the Luhansk region had been waiting eight years for,"" Roscosmos wrote on the Telegram messaging app. ""We are convinced that July 3, 2022, will forever remain in the history of the (Luhansk People's) Republic."" As we've been reporting, leaders from dozens of countries and international organisations are meeting in Lugano, Switzerland to discuss the reconstruction of Ukraine. What's happening? It's an event that's been happening every year since 2017, usually called the Ukraine Reform Conference, but this year renamed the Ukraine Recovery Conference. It is usually an opportunity for Ukraine to show other nations the progress it is making and for international partners to express support. Why is this meeting so significant? This is the first URC since Russian's invasion in February, leaving those in attendance with the sizeable task of trying to map out Ukraine's road to recovery from a war that has left entire pockets of the country in ruins. It is not a conference where donors will be pledging money. It aims to establish the principle and priorities for a reconstruction project that is being compared in scale to the US Marshall Plan for Europe after the Second World War. What's on the agenda? Ukraine conference is expected to work towards a ""Lugano Declaration"" and to begin to work out a road map for the reconstruction of Ukraine. Kyiv's own recovery plan will be discussed, as well as roles and  contributions of international partners. The conference website says social, economic, environmental and infrastructure recovery will all be considered, as well as reforms that are possible or necessary to implement in the current situation. What's needed for recovery? Ukraine's PM Denys Shmyal, who is in Switzerland at the summit, told attendees that his country needed $750bn for a recovery plan. It comes after more than $100bn worth of damage was caused to Ukrainian infrastructure during the fighting, he said. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv It seems
almost certain that Russia will push on to try and take the rest of the Donbas region,
especially the cities of Slavyansk and Kramatorsk - both of which were shelled
in recent days. Kramatorsk is said to hold particular significance to the
separatist movement, being the site of the first uprisings in 2014. Beyond that, the wider Russian strategy is not clear. Much will depend on the state of their
forces if - or when - they take the Donbas region. Putin has tacitly acknowledged this, saying: âThe units that took part in
active hostilities and achieved success and victory in the Luhansk direction
should certainly rest and increase their combat capabilities.â If they are still making rapid advances, they could continue their push to take the entire south of Ukraine, up to and maybe even including the major city of Dnipro or beyond. If, however, they are as exhausted as many analysts predict, and as Putin hinted, it is conceivable they will declare an end to the âspecial military operationâ, Russiaâs euphemistic phrase for this full scale war. They might hope a unilateral ceasefire would take some steam out of the international support for Ukraine, with some, perhaps France and Germany, pushing for peace. Ukraine would no doubt continue the fight, but without a steady stream of weaponry, it could be that the front line becomes a frozen conflict, much like it did between 2014 and 2022. That would suit Russia, keeping its neighbour in a state of turmoil and unrest. Read more here. The cargo ship is anchored about 1km from the shore, outside Karasu port in northwest Turkey Turkish officials have detained a Russian-flagged cargo ship off the Black Sea coast, which Ukraine claims is carrying stolen grain, according to Reuters. ""Upon request, the ship named Zhibek Zholy was halted off [the port of]

Karasu,"" the news agency quoted a senior Turkish official as saying on Monday. Allegations of stolen Ukrainian grain were ""being investigated thoroughly"", the official said, with Russia, the United Nations and third parties involved in talks. An official at Ukraine's Foreign Ministry, citing the nation's maritime administration, told Reuters the ship was carrying the first consignment of 4,500 tonnes of grain from Berdyansk, a Russian-occupied port in south Ukraine. A decision regarding the cargo would be made following a meeting of investigators on Monday, said Vasyl Bodnar, Ukraine's ambassador to Turkey, on national TV - adding that Ukraine was hoping for the confiscation of the grain. Kyiv has accused Moscow of stealing grain from a number ofterritories seized by Russian forces since the invasionbegan in February. The Kremlin has previously denied stealing Ukrainian grain. British Foreign Minister Liz Truss has called for a new Marshall Plan - the post-World War Two US aid program for Europe - to re-build Ukraine. Truss said the new aid program needs to be driven by Ukraine itself and there should be an immediate push to support Ukrainians' return to their homeland. She said it is important to give people ""hope about the future"". Truss said the UK would be hosting next year's Ukraine Reconstruction Conference, which will include key British stakeholders. She added the UK would ""continue to lead in supporting the Ukrainian government's reconstruction and development plan"". The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has said the Kremlin's goal is the military, political and economic destruction of Ukraine. She said Russia wanted to undermine Ukraine's very existence as a state and this could not be allowed to happen. The EU will set up a reconstruction platform to co-ordinate the
rebuilding of Ukraine once the war ends, she added. The platform will be used to map investment needs,
co-ordinate action and channel resources, she told the
Ukraine Recovery Conference in Switzerland. The EU has mobilised around â¬6.2bn (Â£5.3bn) in financial support since the start of Russia's invasion, she said. ""And... more will come. We will engage substantially in the
mid- and long-term reconstruction."" Cities such as Kharkiv have been devastated by the war Ukraine needs $750bn for a recovery plan in the wake of Russia's invasion - Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Monday. Shmyhal told the Ukraine Recovery Conference, currently taking place in Switzerland, there had been over $100bn of direct damage to infrastructure from Russian aggression. The two-day conference in Lugano, which has already heard from President Zelensky, is bringing together several world leaders and NGOs with the aim of drawing up a roadmap for Ukraine's reconstruction after the war. Talks are under way in Lugano, southern Switzerland, to discuss the reconstruction of Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said rebuilding Ukraine was the ""common task of the whole democratic world"". Speaking via video link during the international conference, Zelensky said the ""reconstruction of Ukraine is the biggest contribution to the support of global peace"". Several world leaders and international organisations are attending the two-day conference. They are meeting to draw up a roadmap for Ukraine's recovery and reconstruction. Sophie WilliamsReporting from Kyiv Here in Ukraine, there are reports that Russian forces are
trying to start âadministrative activitiesâ in Severodonetsk. Oleksandr Stryuk, Ukrainian head of the Severodonetsk city military-civilian
administration says a commandantâs office is being set up in order to
conduct a census of the city's population. âThey are now intensively looking for housing and communal
services specialists to at least somehow restore the cityâs infrastructure,â
Stryuk said, adding that portable generators will not be enough to get the city
back up and running. Russia took full control of the city last month. The city
was once home to some 100,000 people but most of its residents are thought to
have fled. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Here are the main headlines: Ukraine Recovery Conference: In other developments:  That's it from us. Today's live page was written by Sam Hancock, George Wright, Catherine Evans, James Harness, Victoria Lindrea, Alexandra FouchÃ© and Malu Cursino. Our editors were Jeremy Gahagan, Rob Corp, Heather Sharp and Claire Heald. The archbishop of Russia's Belgorod western region has called for an end to the ""bloodshed on Ukrainian soil"" -  in a rare display of public opposition to the Kremlin. His remarks - reported in the Russian media -followed a series of missile strikes on the Russian cities of Belgorod and Kursk on Ukraine's border- which Moscow has blamed on Kyiv. ""Last night, missiles from the armed forces of Ukraine hit sleeping Belgorod people in residential areas,"" the archbishop wrote, in a statement posted on the church's official website. ""Among the dead were residents of [Ukraine's] Kharkiv region who came to seek shelter from the war in peaceful Belgorod. ""We call for a special prayer for the repose of the deceased and for the recovery of the injured; for an end to the bloodshed that is taking place on Ukrainian soil, but which today has also reached our homes.""

In her fifth floor apartment in the Russian city of Belgorod, Lidiya tells me of her narrow escape. ""At 10 past three on Sunday morning I was woken by a blinding flash and a loud explosion.

I could see rescuers digging people out of the rubble and carrying away the bodies."" Russia accusesUkraine of launching three missiles at Belgorod. Ukrainian officials have denied it. But whatever it was that exploded in this southern city, the emergency has completely undermined Moscow's claim that it ordered troops into Ukraine to make Russia safer. In reality, the security situation in Belgorod, and other Russian regions near the Ukrainian border, has deteriorated since the invasion. ""This is the first time something like this has happened in the city,"" Lidiya tells me. ""There was no shelling in the city of Belgorod half a year ago."" Local officials say four civilians were killed in the explosion and dozens of houses damaged. Across the border the scale of destruction has been far greater. Since the start of the Russian invasion, thousands of civilians have been killed in Ukraine and some cities have been reduced to rubble by repeated shelling. ""We need to live in peace with Ukraine. We always used to,"" Lidiya tells me. ""So many of us have relatives in Ukraine. And there are many Ukrainians living here."" Most of the people I speak to in Belgorod are not so conciliatory.

This video can not be played WATCH: PM Denys Shmyhal says Russia's oligarchs should pay the estimated $750bn rebuild costs As we've been reporting, leaders from dozens of countries and international organisations are meeting in Switzerland to discuss the future of Ukraine. In a speech to the conference, Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal says the confiscated assets of Russia and its oligarchs should be used to rebuild his country. Shmyhal says Russia should be held accountable for the destruction caused by the war. This video can not be played WATCH: Ursula von der Leyen says Ukraine can emerge from the war a stronger country Speaking at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Switzerland, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen says the Kremlin wants to undermine the existence of Ukraine. However, Ukraine can emerge from the war as a stronger and more modern country, she says. As we've been reporting this afternoon, the Ukraine Recovery Conference is under way in Lugano, Switzerland. World leaders and international organisations have been discussing how they will support Ukraine in its recovery and reconstruction, following Russia's invasion on 24 February. Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Ukraine needs $750bn for a recovery plan. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said the EU has mobilised around â¬6.2bn (Â£5.3bn) in financial support for Ukraine since the start of Russia's invasion. But, also on the agenda, are anti-corruption pledges and demands from Ukraine. Swiss President Ignazio Cassis, co-host of the conference, said: ""It is crucial that these efforts continue unwaveringly, especially in the fight against corruption, improving transparency and the independence of the judiciary, and that they are not stalled by the war."" A side event to discuss anti-corruption strategies has been organised alongside the two-day conference. This is co-hosted by the EU Anti-Corruption Initiative (EUACI), which was set up in 2017 with the aim of reducing corruption in Ukraine at the national and local level. Mathias Cormann, secretary general of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) spoke at the Ukraine Recovery Conference. He said Ukraine was working closely with the OECD in an anti-corruption initiative that aims to tackle bribery and other forms of corruption in the country. This video can not be played President Putin will find ""new targets"" if Russia is not stopped in its war against Ukraine, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson tells MPs in the House of Commons. He says the goal must be for ""our Ukrainians friends"" to win and that Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelensky must have the ""strength to finish this war"". He's been updating MPs after the Nato summit in Madrid last week. Leaders of the G7 group of rich nations are looking at the possibility of getting much-need Ukrainian grain out of the country ""in smaller quantities"" via the River Danube river, UK PM Boris Johnson also tells MPs. The World Trade Organization said a food crisis as a result of the Ukraine war could last for years without intervention. Millions of tonnes of grain are sitting in warehouses and Ukrainian ports that cannot be exported due to a combination of anti-ship mines in the Black Sea and a Russian naval blockade. Read more on that here. Johnson says the UK is not looking at breaching the Montreux Convention - an international agreement that regulates maritime traffic in the Black Sea - and there are alternative solutions that don't involve the presence of British warships. Johnson says getting grain out of Ukraine ""might involve a tougher approach, but what we are also looking at is the possibility of using the rivers, using the Danube in particular"". But, he adds, this might have to be done ""in smaller quantities"" rather than ""a giant maritime convoy"" using the Black Sea. Away from the action in Ukraine and in diplomatic moves, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been updating the MPs in the House of Commons after he spent the last week attending international summits in Africa and Europe, where the conflict in Ukraine dominated. Here's what he had to say:  Labour leader Keir Starmer replied: Sarah RainsfordEastern Europe correspondent, reporting from Kyiv (l-r) Mark, âSkifâ and Nikolai: mechanic, businessman and medic - turned soldiers Three Ukrainian soldiers whoâve served in the Donbas have described the fighting there as
brutal. They say the Russian troops they faced are far more experienced and
ruthless than those who tried to take Kyiv in the spring. âRussians like to destroy a city, a village, totally. Never mind whoâs
there - Ukrainian civilians or military,â Mark, a volunteer fighter just
back from the front line in the Luhansk region, told me. He said Russia was using its overwhelming firepower to ""wipe out"" villages in its advance, leaving the Ukrainians with little cover. Another soldier,
Nikolai, told me heâd be lying if he didnât admit it was ""terrifying"". They asked
for more support, more weapons. All three soldiers agree with Ukraine pulling back when its troops are
outgunned: âItâs very hard to hold ground. Itâs a lot of deaths. Thereâs
nothing left there now anyway. No civilians. No city. They bombed it all."" They canât give details of casualties, but talked of ""so many"". âPeople
we studied with, shared food with, volunteers like us. Many are gone.â And yet, they insisted they would go back to the Donbas within days to fight
on. âWe want payback,â said Nikolai. âAnd we want to protect our
families, our friends, from the terrible things that Russians do with our civilians.

We lost battle not the war - Ukraine governor,"Russian shelling has laid waste to large areas of the city Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his defence minister to continue the offensive in Ukraine after Russia captured the city of Lysychansk. Mr Putin was shown on Russian TV calling on forces on other fronts to pursue their aims according to ""previously approved plans"". The capture means that all of Luhansk region is now in Russian hands. Earlier the region's Ukrainian governor said the city was abandoned so Russians would not destroy it from a distance. Soldiers have now moved to new fortified positions, Serhiy Haidai told the BBC. Losing the city and ceding control of Luhansk to Russia was painful, he said, but added: ""This is just one battle we have lost, but not the war."" He pleaded for more weapons from the West to offset the Russian advantage. President Volodymyr Zelensky has pledged that Ukrainian forces will return to retake Lysychansk ""thanks to the increase in the supply of modern weapons"". What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine? Russia has now stepped up its bombardment of cities in the neighbouring Donetsk region, with the areas around Sloviansk and the road between Lysychansk and Bakhmut in particular being targeted, according to Ukrainian forces. Together the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk form the industrial Donbas area. Mr Putin was seen telling Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu that troops who took part in the campaign to capture Luhansk should ""rest and develop their combat capabilities"". ""Other military units, including the East group and the West group, must carry out their tasks according to previously approved plans,"" he said, expressing the hope that on those fronts they would have similar success to that in Luhansk region. Just before he launched the invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, Mr Putin recognised all of Luhansk and Donetsk as independent states. Russian proxy forces began an insurgency there in 2014 - the year Russia also annexed the Crimean peninsula. Just over a week ago, Russian troops captured Severodonetsk - which Russian bombardment has reduced to ruins. Three Ukrainian soldiers who've served in the Donbas have described the fighting there as brutal. ""Russians like to destroy a city, a village, totally. Never mind who's there - Ukrainian civilians or military,"" Mark, a volunteer fighter just back from the front line in the Luhansk region, told me. Another soldier, Nikolai, told me he'd be lying if he didn't admit it was ""terrifying"". All three soldiers agree with Ukraine pulling back when its troops are outgunned: ""It's very hard to hold ground. It's a lot of deaths. There's nothing left there now anyway. No civilians. No city. They bombed it all."" They can't give details of casualties, but talked of ""so many"". ""People we studied with, shared food with, volunteers like us. Many are gone."" And yet, they insisted they would go back to the Donbas within days to fight on. Speaking about the decision to leave Lysychansk, Mr Haidai said: ""Our military could have held the city for a long time, but Russia currently has a huge advantage in artillery and ammunition. They would have simply destroyed the city from a distance, so there was no point in staying."" Mr Haidai said troops had now moved to positions in neighbouring Donetsk, but that 10,000 people remained in the city. In other developments: Ukraine needs $750bn for a recovery plan and Russian oligarchs should contribute to the cost, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal has told a reconstruction conference in Switzerland British Foreign Minister Liz Truss has called for a new Marshall Plan to rebuild Ukraine, in reference to the huge US aid programme for Europe after World War Two Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, told the conference that Russia wants to undermine Ukraine's existence, but it can emerge from the war as a stronger and more modern country Ukraine's military said it had raised the Ukrainian flag again on Snake Island, afterRussian troops left the tiny but strategic outcropin the Black Sea last week STOLEN GRAIN:Tracking where Russia takes Ukraine's grain ANALYSIS:Why Russia couldn't hold Snake Island FACT CHECKED:Russia's claims about shopping centre attack READ MORE:Full coverage of the crisis,external Ukraine war in maps: Ukraine's counter-offensive into Russian territory Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Surprise fall in inflation boosts interest rate cut hopes Why a small drop in inflation matters to you Family unaware missing sisters had ended Aberdeen tenancy What happens if TikTok is banned?

Sri Lanka warns petrol stocks about to run dryThe crisis-hit country's next shipment of petrol is not due to arrive until later this month.,"Sri Lanka's energy minister has issued a stark warning over the country's fuel stocks as it faces its worst economic crisis in more than 70 years. On Sunday, Kanchana Wijesekera said the nation only had enough petrol left for less than a day under regular demand. He also said its next petrol shipment was not due for more than two weeks. Last week, Sri Lanka suspended sales of petrol and diesel for non-essential vehicles as it struggles to pay for imports like fuel, food and medicines. Mr Wijesekera told reporters that the country had 12,774 tonnes of diesel and 4,061 tonnes of petrol left in its reserves. ""The next petrol shipment is expected between the 22nd and 23rd [of July],"" he added. 'Living in my car for two days to buy fuel' What's behind Sri Lanka's petrol shortage? A shipment of diesel is expected to arrive at the weekend, however Mr Wijesekera warned that the country does not have enough money to pay for planned fuel and crude oil imports. He said Sri Lanka's central bank could only supply $125m for fuel purchases, far less than the $587m needed for its scheduled shipments. Mr Wijesekera added that the country owed $800m to seven suppliers for purchases it made earlier this year. Last week Sri Lankabanned sales of fuel for private vehiclesfor two week. Experts believe it is the first country to take the drastic step of halting sales of petrol to ordinary people since the 1970s oil crisis, when fuel was rationed in the US and Europe. The country has seen protests The island nation of 22 million people is facing its worst economic crisis since gaining independence from the UK in 1948 as it lacks enough foreign currency to pay for imports of essential goods. Acute shortages of fuel, food and medicines have helped to push up the cost of living to record highs in the country, where many people rely on motor vehicles for their livelihoods. It's also sparked violent street protests. The government blames the Covid pandemic, which affected Sri Lanka's tourist trade - one of its biggest foreign currency earners. However, many experts say economic mismanagement is to blame. In May the country failed to make a payment on its foreign debt for the first time in its history. Rajini Vaidyanathan, BBC South Asia correspondent in Colombo The streets of this usually bustling capital are much quieter now and Colombo has the feel of a city under lockdown. With fuel in short supply people have been urged to stay home where possible. But outside fuel stations is where you will find long queues. Members of the military guard the pumps, patrolling the forecourts - here petrol has become more precious than gold. Van driver Aziz has been in line for two days: ""We are suffering, we've no lunch no breakfast, we've just had water as we wait."" The struggle for fuel is also accompanied by a struggle for food. With food inflation at 80% for the month of June, many Sri Lankans are skipping meals. Charity Unicef says more than two-thirds of the country has cut down on food since the start of the year. Its spokesperson in Sri Lanka told the BBC that if outside help doesn't arrive soon to this island nation, there could be a humanitarian crisis in the coming months. BBC India business correspondent Archana Shulka says that while Sri Lanka has not completely ground to a halt yet, it is precariously close to seizing up. Export-driven industries, such as textile and clothing, have been helped to keep going by the government as the economy needs to earn significant amounts of foreign currency. However, the fuel supplies needed to power machinery in these industries and to transport goods are also drying up now, our correspondent says. The IT industry, which is still developing in the country, has also been heavily affected as firms face power cuts and internet outages. All of this has prompted concerns of a so-called ""brain drain"", with fears that large numbers of young professionals could leave the country.

While no agreement has been reached yet,the team said in a statement,externalthat it had made ""significant progress on defining a macroeconomic and structural policy package"". It added that it had ""witnessed some of the hardships currently faced by the Sri Lankan people, especially the poor and vulnerable who are affected disproportionately by the crisis"".

Parents asked about staff-to-child ratio in nursery,"Staff at Yellow Wellies Day Nursery in Durham are worried the changes would reduce quality for two-year-olds Plans to let nurseries and childminders look after more two-year-olds in England are to be put to parents. In England, one adult can be in charge of four children, but the government says it wants to lower the cost for parents by following the Scottish model of one adult caring for five toddlers. Most nurseries say the systems cannot be compared and do not want the change. A mum who has spent more than Â£90,000 in nursery fees in seven years doubts a change would save parents much money. The consultation,externalinto the idea is expected to take eight weeks. Will Quince, the children and families minister, said it was about offering flexibility to early years settings and that he did not want to do anything that ""compromises quality or safety"". He told the BBC the Scottish model was a good one and ""it's only a slight tweak or variation to what we do"". ""But that's exactly why we are consulting because we've got to listen to the sector and, importantly, listen to parents to make sure that whatever we propose we are getting it right."" he added. Nurseries resist staff looking after more children Why free nursery childcare can come with costly extras Mother-of-two Amanda Smallbone, whose younger child attends a Durham nursery, says that as a working parent she already felt guilty about putting her children in someone else's care. But that means she wants them to have the best experience and ""part of that is being part of a smaller group and having that additional care"". Amanda questions how big the savings would actually be. She believes using the new ratios could create a two-tier system for parents - those who can afford paying for the extra costs of lower ratios and ""those who have to be driven by price as they have no other choice"". A full-time nursery place for a child under two now costs, on average, more than Â£14,000 a year in the UK,Coram family and childcare's recent annual survey found.,external In a separate interview with PA news agency, Mr Quince said other countries ""put far more money into early years' education"" - but people ""pay a lot more in tax"". Bridget Phillipson, Labour's shadow secretary of state for education, called the announcement ""pathetic"". ""Tweaking ratios is not the answer parents want and not the answer children need,"" she said. She added that Labour would introduce a ""fourfold increase"" in the early years pupil premium, which is funding given to early years providers for disadvantaged three and four-year-olds. Amanda Smallbone, from Durham, has spent more than Â£90,000 in nursery fees for her two children Most nurseries and pre-schools in England are opposed to the ratio changes andsay the plans will not cut costs for parents. Dr Kate Jones, the owner of Yellow Wellies Day Nursery in Durham, says they probably would not adopt the new ratio, even if the plan was approved. She says the proposal is about ""reducing quality"" for two-year-olds who are just learning how to do things for themselves. ""At lunchtime we have allergies, we have choking risks and usually we have some kind of toileting emergency and that is just with four of them,"" she says. With the nursery trying to retain its best staff and cope with a much larger electricity bill, Dr Jones adds that for parents ""the reduction in fees would not be a reduction, but maintaining at best"". At Little Flyers nursery in Broxburn near Edinburgh, one adult can look after five two-year-olds. Pamela Stein, the learning and development manager, says it is vital that staff have the right skills and resources to be able to provide ""a safe nurturing experience"". She says all their practitioners must complete a certain amount of training every year to maintain their obligatory registration with the Scottish social services council and help ensure that adult-to-child ratio remains safe. In Scotland, one adult can look after five two-year-olds, but providers say the English system is very different. The National Day Nurseries Association, which has members in England and Scotland, says the two systems cannot be compared. It says that in Scotland: more staff have at least a level three qualification in childcare (84%) compared with England (76%) nurseries receive on average more funding per child from local authorities the nurseries are exempt from business rates a larger proportion than in England are run by the local councils, where costs are different Eva Lloyd, a professor of early childhood at the University of East London,who co-authored a research report on the costs of childcare in 2013,externalwhen the ratio change was being considered by the coalition government, says it is ""a dangerous move"" that won't benefit parents, children or the sector. She says the measures being proposed will not make any difference ""until and unless we absolutely address workforce paying conditions head on"". ""We have the most serious recruitment and retention crisis in childcare employees than we've ever had as far as records go, and my prediction would be that even more will leave,"" she added. Meanwhile, the government also says it hopes to increase the number of childminders by allowing them to work from a local community centre or village hall rather than their own home. It says it is working with Ofsted to make it easier for childminders to register and to reduce inspections. The early years foundation stage framework they are expected to follow will be reduced as well. A new drive to target parents who are not taking up existing childcare offers has also been announced.

Sri Lanka warns petrol stocks about to run dry,"Sri Lanka's energy minister has issued a stark warning over the country's fuel stocks as it faces its worst economic crisis in more than 70 years. On Sunday, Kanchana Wijesekera said the nation only had enough petrol left for less than a day under regular demand. He also said its next petrol shipment was not due for more than two weeks. Last week, Sri Lanka suspended sales of petrol and diesel for non-essential vehicles as it struggles to pay for imports like fuel, food and medicines.

Long motorway queues as go-slow fuel protests startConvoys of protesters are driving slowly on motorways as they call for fuel duty to be cut.UK,"This video can not be played Watch: Motorways brought to a standstill by fuel price protesters More than a dozen protesters were arrested for driving too slowly during demonstrations on motorways in England, Wales and Scotland over fuel prices. The go-slow action mainly targeted three-lane motorways with convoys of vehicles crawling along two lanes - leaving the ""fast"" outside lane free. Twelve people were arrested during a protest on the M4, which led to the Prince of Wales Bridge, between England and Wales, being closed. Another man was arrested near the A38. Protesters, organised under the social media banner Fuel Price Stand Against Tax, drove in a series of convoys at 30mph (48.3km/h) to cause gridlock on major roads and motorways. Chief Superintendent Tom Harding from Gwent Police said people had been arrested for driving under 30mph for a ""prolonged amount of time"". The roads affected by disruption included: the M4 and Prince of Wales Bridge the M5 in Devon the M32 in Gloucestershire the A38 in Devon the M180 in Lincolnshire the A12 in Essex the A92 in Scotland the A64 near York Gwent Police said organisers of the protest had been given a legal notice to prevent them from blocking the bridge over the River Severn and from driving under 30mph. Ch Supt Harding said restrictions had been placed on the protest as otherwise ""emergency and critical services"" would have been restricted. Tariq Akram said other cars joined the convoy as it went by Tariq Akram said his was one of 50 vehicles making the 60-mile journey through Scunthorpe and Doncaster at 20mph. The Scunthorpe truck driver told the BBC his company had added Â£4,000 to its fuel bill in the past four months because of rising prices. ""The turnout was absolutely fantastic. There were 35 vehicles from our yard alone who took part,"" he said. ""At one point, I thought some cars wanted to overtake so I tried to let them by, then I realised they were joining in."" Police Scotland has told drivers to drive at an appropriate speed for the conditions Avon and Somerset Police said all protests in its area had finished and thanked the public for their patience in a tweet at 15:20 BST. Earlier, Devon and Cornwall Police said it was aware of a go-slow protest heading northbound from Exeter services on the M5. The force also said a further protest began on the A38 heading north from Ivybridge, where a man in his 50s was arrested after ignoring a warning about unsafe driving. ""Unfortunately we have had unsafe driving on the A38 including vehicles travelling at a dangerously low speed,"" a force spokesman said. Why is petrol so expensive in the UK? Fact vs fiction: Five tips for saving petrol money examined Steve Nash, who got stuck on the M5, said the protesters might be ""going about it the wrong way"" Steve Nash, who was delayed on the M5 by protesters as he drove to Exeter Airport to return a hire car, is hopeful the delay will not result in a penalty fee. ""I'm not sure what they're achieving - other than inconveniencing people,"" he said. ""I'm not critical of the sentiment behind what they're trying to do, I just think they're possibly going about it the wrong way."" The retired civil servant from Tiverton said his journey that would usually take 20 minutes took an hour on Monday. He said he felt the protesters should be ""stood outside parliament or writing to their MPs"". ""I think it's not affecting the people you need to actually protest, which is Parliament. The protesters have actually inconvenienced everyone else who is inconvenienced by high fuel prices."" Police Scotland said it had beenaware of protests on motorways and trunk roadsand urged motorists to drive at an appropriate speed for the road conditions. But the force had warned journey times could be longer than normal. In Lincolnshire, police blocked junction one between the M180 and M18 forcing protesters to remain on the former. West Yorkshire Police said a ""single tyre deflation device"" - also known as a ""stinger"" - had been deployed, but it was not used. West Mercia Police said some of the tactics used during a protest on the M54, which had ended by about 08:30 BST, had ""compromised the safety of other road users"" and said officers wouldtake action against those who committed traffic offences. A Facebook event called Stand Up to Fuel Prices, with more than 57,000 responses, had called for people to take their cars, lorries and tractors to cause roadblocks all over the country ""until there is change"". The organisers wrote that fuel costs were driving up other costs of living and said they hoped the more people that joined the protest, the sooner living costs would drop. Fuel prices have risen to record highs in recent weeks with figures from data firm Experian showing the average price of a litre of petrol at UK forecourts had hit 191.5p and 199.0p for diesel on Sunday. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said there did not appear to be any sign of retailers reducing forecourt prices, despite weekly wholesale costs having fallen for five weeks. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said he will carefully consider calls for a ""more substantial"" fuel duty cut after the 5p per litre reduction implemented in March failed to halt price rises. Rising fuel prices have been pushed even higher by the war in Ukraine, with Russia, one of the world's largest oil exporters, facing sanctions. A convoy of vehicles on the M180 in Lincolnshire Police escort vehicles across the Prince of Wales Bridge, which runs between England and Wales The government had said while it understands people are struggling with rising prices and have a right to protest, ""people's day-to-day lives should not be disrupted"" and warned traffic delays ""will only add to fuel use"". Howard Cox, founder of campaign group FairFuelUK, said other countries had cut fuel duty more than the UK and called for a reduction of at least 20p. While he said his organisation was not involved in the protests, he said there was an appetite for them - and if the government did not deliver on the issue there could be ""some serious escalation of protests"".

We lost battle not the war - Ukraine governorSerhiy Haidai tells the BBC that troops left the key city of Lysychansk to save it from Russian destruction.Europe,"Russian shelling has laid waste to large areas of the city Russian President Vladimir Putin has ordered his defence minister to continue the offensive in Ukraine after Russia captured the city of Lysychansk. Mr Putin was shown on Russian TV calling on forces on other fronts to pursue their aims according to ""previously approved plans"". The capture means that all of Luhansk region is now in Russian hands. Earlier the region's Ukrainian governor said the city was abandoned so Russians would not destroy it from a distance. Soldiers have now moved to new fortified positions, Serhiy Haidai told the BBC. Losing the city and ceding control of Luhansk to Russia was painful, he said, but added: ""This is just one battle we have lost, but not the war."" He pleaded for more weapons from the West to offset the Russian advantage. President Volodymyr Zelensky has pledged that Ukrainian forces will return to retake Lysychansk ""thanks to the increase in the supply of modern weapons"". What weapons are being supplied to Ukraine? Russia has now stepped up its bombardment of cities in the neighbouring Donetsk region, with the areas around Sloviansk and the road between Lysychansk and Bakhmut in particular being targeted, according to Ukrainian forces. Together the regions of Donetsk and Luhansk form the industrial Donbas area. Mr Putin was seen telling Defence Minister Sergei Shoigu that troops who took part in the campaign to capture Luhansk should ""rest and develop their combat capabilities"". ""Other military units, including the East group and the West group, must carry out their tasks according to previously approved plans,"" he said, expressing the hope that on those fronts they would have similar success to that in Luhansk region. Just before he launched the invasion of Ukraine on 24 February, Mr Putin recognised all of Luhansk and Donetsk as independent states. Russian proxy forces began an insurgency there in 2014 - the year Russia also annexed the Crimean peninsula. Just over a week ago, Russian troops captured Severodonetsk - which Russian bombardment has reduced to ruins. Three Ukrainian soldiers who've served in the Donbas have described the fighting there as brutal. ""Russians like to destroy a city, a village, totally. Never mind who's there - Ukrainian civilians or military,"" Mark, a volunteer fighter just back from the front line in the Luhansk region, told me. Another soldier, Nikolai, told me he'd be lying if he didn't admit it was ""terrifying"". All three soldiers agree with Ukraine pulling back when its troops are outgunned: ""It's very hard to hold ground. It's a lot of deaths. There's nothing left there now anyway. No civilians. No city. They bombed it all."" They can't give details of casualties, but talked of ""so many"". ""People we studied with, shared food with, volunteers like us. Many are gone."" And yet, they insisted they would go back to the Donbas within days to fight on. Speaking about the decision to leave Lysychansk, Mr Haidai said: ""Our military could have held the city for a long time, but Russia currently has a huge advantage in artillery and ammunition. They would have simply destroyed the city from a distance, so there was no point in staying."" Mr Haidai said troops had now moved to positions in neighbouring Donetsk, but that 10,000 people remained in the city. In other developments: Ukraine needs $750bn for a recovery plan and Russian oligarchs should contribute to the cost, Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal has told a reconstruction conference in Switzerland British Foreign Minister Liz Truss has called for a new Marshall Plan to rebuild Ukraine, in reference to the huge US aid programme for Europe after World War Two Ursula von der Leyen, the president of the European Commission, told the conference that Russia wants to undermine Ukraine's existence, but it can emerge from the war as a stronger and more modern country Ukraine's military said it had raised the Ukrainian flag again on Snake Island, afterRussian troops left the tiny but strategic outcropin the Black Sea last week STOLEN GRAIN:Tracking where Russia takes Ukraine's grain ANALYSIS:Why Russia couldn't hold Snake Island FACT CHECKED:Russia's claims about shopping centre attack READ MORE:Full coverage of the crisis,external Ukraine war in maps: Ukraine's counter-offensive into Russian territory Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Surprise fall in inflation boosts interest rate cut hopes Why a small drop in inflation matters to you Family unaware missing sisters had ended Aberdeen tenancy What happens if TikTok is banned?

LiveLiveRussia to push further into Donbas after taking key region5 minutes ago,"Leaders from dozens of countries and international organisations are meeting in Switzerland to create a plan to rebuild Ukraine after the war The reconstruction effort has been likened to the US-led Marshall Plan to rebuild Europe after World War Two It will cost $750bn for Ukraine to recover and Russia's invasion has caused $100bn of direct damage to infrastructure, PM Denys Shmyhal says On the ground, Russia will try to take full control of Donbas in eastern Ukraine after seizing the key region of Luhansk, Ukraine's regional governor says Russian forces have captured the eastern city of Lysychansk, and claimed control of the wider Luhansk region President Putin has congratulated Russian troops on ""liberating"" the area; Ukraine's President Zelensky has vowed to retake Luhansk Moscow has accused Ukraine of targeting civilians in a missile strike against the Russian city of Belgorod - but Kyiv has dismissed that claim Edited by Claire Heald We're wrapping up our live coverage of the war in Ukraine for the day. Here are the main headlines: Ukraine Recovery Conference: In other developments:  That's it from us. Today's live page was written by Sam Hancock, George Wright, Catherine Evans, James Harness, Victoria Lindrea, Alexandra FouchÃ© and Malu Cursino. Our editors were Jeremy Gahagan, Rob Corp, Heather Sharp and Claire Heald. The archbishop of Russia's Belgorod western region has called for an end to the ""bloodshed on Ukrainian soil"" -  in a rare display of public opposition to the Kremlin. His remarks - reported in the Russian media -followed a series of missile strikes on the Russian cities of Belgorod and Kursk on Ukraine's border- which Moscow has blamed on Kyiv. ""Last night, missiles from the armed forces of Ukraine hit sleeping Belgorod people in residential areas,"" the archbishop wrote, in a statement posted on the church's official website. ""Among the dead were residents of [Ukraine's] Kharkiv region who came to seek shelter from the war in peaceful Belgorod. ""We call for a special prayer for the repose of the deceased and for the recovery of the injured; for an end to the bloodshed that is taking place on Ukrainian soil, but which today has also reached our homes."" Steve RosenbergBBC Russia editor, reporting from Belgorod The site of the blast in Belgorod Developments now on the Russian side of the border with Ukraine... In her fifth floor apartment in the Russian city of Belgorod, Lidiya tells me of her narrow escape. ""At 10 past three on Sunday morning I was woken by a blinding flash and a loud explosion. I ran onto my balcony and saw a giant ball of flames heading towards the building. ""I ran inside. Suddenly all my windows shattered. ""Down below I heard shouting and crying. I could see rescuers digging people out of the rubble and carrying away the bodies."" Russia accusesUkraine of launching three missiles at Belgorod. Ukrainian officials have denied it. But whatever it was that exploded in this southern city, the emergency has completely undermined Moscow's claim that it ordered troops into Ukraine to make Russia safer. In reality, the security situation in Belgorod, and other Russian regions near the Ukrainian border, has deteriorated since the invasion. ""This is the first time something like this has happened in the city,"" Lidiya tells me. ""There was no shelling in the city of Belgorod half a year ago."" Local officials say four civilians were killed in the explosion and dozens of houses damaged. Across the border the scale of destruction has been far greater. Since the start of the Russian invasion, thousands of civilians have been killed in Ukraine and some cities have been reduced to rubble by repeated shelling. ""We need to live in peace with Ukraine. We always used to,"" Lidiya tells me. ""So many of us have relatives in Ukraine. And there are many Ukrainians living here."" Most of the people I speak to in Belgorod are not so conciliatory.

This video can not be played WATCH: PM Denys Shmyhal says Russia's oligarchs should pay the estimated $750bn rebuild costs As we've been reporting, leaders from dozens of countries and international organisations are meeting in Switzerland to discuss the future of Ukraine. In a speech to the conference, Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal says the confiscated assets of Russia and its oligarchs should be used to rebuild his country. Shmyhal says Russia should be held accountable for the destruction caused by the war. This video can not be played WATCH: Ursula von der Leyen says Ukraine can emerge from the war a stronger country Speaking at the Ukraine Recovery Conference in Switzerland, President of the European Commission Ursula von der Leyen says the Kremlin wants to undermine the existence of Ukraine. However, Ukraine can emerge from the war as a stronger and more modern country, she says. As we've been reporting this afternoon, the Ukraine Recovery Conference is under way in Lugano, Switzerland. World leaders and international organisations have been discussing how they will support Ukraine in its recovery and reconstruction, following Russia's invasion on 24 February. Ukraine's Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said Ukraine needs $750bn for a recovery plan. Ursula von der Leyen, president of the European Commission, said the EU has mobilised around â¬6.2bn (Â£5.3bn) in financial support for Ukraine since the start of Russia's invasion. But, also on the agenda, are anti-corruption pledges and demands from Ukraine. Swiss President Ignazio Cassis, co-host of the conference, said: ""It is crucial that these efforts continue unwaveringly, especially in the fight against corruption, improving transparency and the independence of the judiciary, and that they are not stalled by the war."" A side event to discuss anti-corruption strategies has been organised alongside the two-day conference. This is co-hosted by the EU Anti-Corruption Initiative (EUACI), which was set up in 2017 with the aim of reducing corruption in Ukraine at the national and local level. Mathias Cormann, secretary general of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) spoke at the Ukraine Recovery Conference. He said Ukraine was working closely with the OECD in an anti-corruption initiative that aims to tackle bribery and other forms of corruption in the country. This video can not be played President Putin will find ""new targets"" if Russia is not stopped in its war against Ukraine, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson tells MPs in the House of Commons. He says the goal must be for ""our Ukrainians friends"" to win and that Ukraine and President Volodymyr Zelensky must have the ""strength to finish this war"". He's been updating MPs after the Nato summit in Madrid last week. Leaders of the G7 group of rich nations are looking at the possibility of getting much-need Ukrainian grain out of the country ""in smaller quantities"" via the River Danube river, UK PM Boris Johnson also tells MPs. The World Trade Organization said a food crisis as a result of the Ukraine war could last for years without intervention. Millions of tonnes of grain are sitting in warehouses and Ukrainian ports that cannot be exported due to a combination of anti-ship mines in the Black Sea and a Russian naval blockade. Read more on that here. Johnson says the UK is not looking at breaching the Montreux Convention - an international agreement that regulates maritime traffic in the Black Sea - and there are alternative solutions that don't involve the presence of British warships. Johnson says getting grain out of Ukraine ""might involve a tougher approach, but what we are also looking at is the possibility of using the rivers, using the Danube in particular"". But, he adds, this might have to be done ""in smaller quantities"" rather than ""a giant maritime convoy"" using the Black Sea. Away from the action in Ukraine and in diplomatic moves, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has been updating the MPs in the House of Commons after he spent the last week attending international summits in Africa and Europe, where the conflict in Ukraine dominated. Here's what he had to say:  Labour leader Keir Starmer replied: Sarah RainsfordEastern Europe correspondent, reporting from Kyiv (l-r) Mark, âSkifâ and Nikolai: mechanic, businessman and medic - turned soldiers Three Ukrainian soldiers whoâve served in the Donbas have described the fighting there as
brutal. They say the Russian troops they faced are far more experienced and
ruthless than those who tried to take Kyiv in the spring. âRussians like to destroy a city, a village, totally. Never mind whoâs
there - Ukrainian civilians or military,â Mark, a volunteer fighter just
back from the front line in the Luhansk region, told me. He said Russia was using its overwhelming firepower to ""wipe out"" villages in its advance, leaving the Ukrainians with little cover. Another soldier,
Nikolai, told me heâd be lying if he didnât admit it was ""terrifying"". They asked
for more support, more weapons. All three soldiers agree with Ukraine pulling back when its troops are
outgunned: âItâs very hard to hold ground. Itâs a lot of deaths. Thereâs
nothing left there now anyway. No civilians. No city. They bombed it all."" They canât give details of casualties, but talked of ""so many"". âPeople
we studied with, shared food with, volunteers like us. Many are gone.â And yet, they insisted they would go back to the Donbas within days to fight
on. âWe want payback,â said Nikolai. âAnd we want to protect our
families, our friends, from the terrible things that Russians do with our civilians.
[What happened in] Irpin, Hostemel, Bucha... we canât let it happen again.â Sophie WilliamsReporting from Kyiv Turning to the situation on the ground in that region, Serhiy Haidai, head of Luhansk regional administration, says that more than 10,000 people are left in Lysychansk in eastern Ukraine. He made the remarks during an interview with Ukrainian media. Lysychansk is the latest city to have been taken by Russian troops. Ukrainian military said that after heavy fighting, defending forces were forced to withdraw from their positions. Russian cosmonauts on the ISS held the flag of the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic In March, not long after Russia invaded Ukraine, three Russian cosmonauts boarded the International Space Station wearing yellow and blue, in what many perceived as a show of support for Ukraine. They were warmly welcomed on board, hugging and greeting their  American, Russian and German fellow crew members. The Russian space agency denied the claims. ""Sometimes yellow is just yellow,"" said the Roscosmos space agency at the time. But now Denis Matveyev, Oleg Artemyev and Sergey Korsakov have been pictured celebrating Russia's
capture of the last major city in the eastern Ukrainian region of Luhansk. Many thought the team were showing solidarity with Ukraine in March, although the Russian space agency denied this The agency posted pictures of the three men smiling as they held up flags of Russia's proxies in eastern Ukraine, the self-proclaimed Luhansk People's Republic and Donetsk People's Republic. ""This is a long-awaited day that the residents of the occupied areas of the Luhansk region had been waiting eight years for,"" Roscosmos wrote on the Telegram messaging app. ""We are convinced that July 3, 2022, will forever remain in the history of the (Luhansk People's) Republic."" As we've been reporting, leaders from dozens of countries and international organisations are meeting in Lugano, Switzerland to discuss the reconstruction of Ukraine. What's happening? It's an event that's been happening every year since 2017, usually called the Ukraine Reform Conference, but this year renamed the Ukraine Recovery Conference. It is usually an opportunity for Ukraine to show other nations the progress it is making and for international partners to express support. Why is this meeting so significant? This is the first URC since Russian's invasion in February, leaving those in attendance with the sizeable task of trying to map out Ukraine's road to recovery from a war that has left entire pockets of the country in ruins. It is not a conference where donors will be pledging money. It aims to establish the principle and priorities for a reconstruction project that is being compared in scale to the US Marshall Plan for Europe after the Second World War. What's on the agenda? Ukraine conference is expected to work towards a ""Lugano Declaration"" and to begin to work out a road map for the reconstruction of Ukraine. Kyiv's own recovery plan will be discussed, as well as roles and  contributions of international partners. The conference website says social, economic, environmental and infrastructure recovery will all be considered, as well as reforms that are possible or necessary to implement in the current situation. What's needed for recovery? Ukraine's PM Denys Shmyal, who is in Switzerland at the summit, told attendees that his country needed $750bn for a recovery plan. It comes after more than $100bn worth of damage was caused to Ukrainian infrastructure during the fighting, he said. Joe InwoodReporting from Kyiv It seems
almost certain that Russia will push on to try and take the rest of the Donbas region,
especially the cities of Slavyansk and Kramatorsk - both of which were shelled
in recent days. Kramatorsk is said to hold particular significance to the
separatist movement, being the site of the first uprisings in 2014. Beyond that, the wider Russian strategy is not clear. Much will depend on the state of their
forces if - or when - they take the Donbas region. Putin has tacitly acknowledged this, saying: âThe units that took part in
active hostilities and achieved success and victory in the Luhansk direction
should certainly rest and increase their combat capabilities.â If they are still making rapid advances, they could continue their push to take the entire south of Ukraine, up to and maybe even including the major city of Dnipro or beyond. If, however, they are as exhausted as many analysts predict, and as Putin hinted, it is conceivable they will declare an end to the âspecial military operationâ, Russiaâs euphemistic phrase for this full scale war. They might hope a unilateral ceasefire would take some steam out of the international support for Ukraine, with some, perhaps France and Germany, pushing for peace. Ukraine would no doubt continue the fight, but without a steady stream of weaponry, it could be that the front line becomes a frozen conflict, much like it did between 2014 and 2022. That would suit Russia, keeping its neighbour in a state of turmoil and unrest. Read more here. The cargo ship is anchored about 1km from the shore, outside Karasu port in northwest Turkey Turkish officials have detained a Russian-flagged cargo ship off the Black Sea coast, which Ukraine claims is carrying stolen grain, according to Reuters. ""Upon request, the ship named Zhibek Zholy was halted off [the port of]

Karasu,"" the news agency quoted a senior Turkish official as saying on Monday. Allegations of stolen Ukrainian grain were ""being investigated thoroughly"", the official said, with Russia, the United Nations and third parties involved in talks. An official at Ukraine's Foreign Ministry, citing the nation's maritime administration, told Reuters the ship was carrying the first consignment of 4,500 tonnes of grain from Berdyansk, a Russian-occupied port in south Ukraine. A decision regarding the cargo would be made following a meeting of investigators on Monday, said Vasyl Bodnar, Ukraine's ambassador to Turkey, on national TV - adding that Ukraine was hoping for the confiscation of the grain. Kyiv has accused Moscow of stealing grain from a number ofterritories seized by Russian forces since the invasionbegan in February. The Kremlin has previously denied stealing Ukrainian grain. British Foreign Minister Liz Truss has called for a new Marshall Plan - the post-World War Two US aid program for Europe - to re-build Ukraine. Truss said the new aid program needs to be driven by Ukraine itself and there should be an immediate push to support Ukrainians' return to their homeland. She said it is important to give people ""hope about the future"". Truss said the UK would be hosting next year's Ukraine Reconstruction Conference, which will include key British stakeholders. She added the UK would ""continue to lead in supporting the Ukrainian government's reconstruction and development plan"". The President of the European Commission, Ursula von der Leyen, has said the Kremlin's goal is the military, political and economic destruction of Ukraine. She said Russia wanted to undermine Ukraine's very existence as a state and this could not be allowed to happen. The EU will set up a reconstruction platform to co-ordinate the
rebuilding of Ukraine once the war ends, she added. The platform will be used to map investment needs,
co-ordinate action and channel resources, she told the
Ukraine Recovery Conference in Switzerland. The EU has mobilised around â¬6.2bn (Â£5.3bn) in financial support since the start of Russia's invasion, she said. ""And... more will come. We will engage substantially in the
mid- and long-term reconstruction."" Cities such as Kharkiv have been devastated by the war Ukraine needs $750bn for a recovery plan in the wake of Russia's invasion - Ukrainian Prime Minister Denys Shmyhal said on Monday. Shmyhal told the Ukraine Recovery Conference, currently taking place in Switzerland, there had been over $100bn of direct damage to infrastructure from Russian aggression. The two-day conference in Lugano, which has already heard from President Zelensky, is bringing together several world leaders and NGOs with the aim of drawing up a roadmap for Ukraine's reconstruction after the war. Talks are under way in Lugano, southern Switzerland, to discuss the reconstruction of Ukraine. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said rebuilding Ukraine was the ""common task of the whole democratic world"". Speaking via video link during the international conference, Zelensky said the ""reconstruction of Ukraine is the biggest contribution to the support of global peace"". Several world leaders and international organisations are attending the two-day conference. They are meeting to draw up a roadmap for Ukraine's recovery and reconstruction. Sophie WilliamsReporting from Kyiv Here in Ukraine, there are reports that Russian forces are
trying to start âadministrative activitiesâ in Severodonetsk. Oleksandr Stryuk, Ukrainian head of the Severodonetsk city military-civilian
administration says a commandantâs office is being set up in order to
conduct a census of the city's population. âThey are now intensively looking for housing and communal
services specialists to at least somehow restore the cityâs infrastructure,â
Stryuk said, adding that portable generators will not be enough to get the city
back up and running. Russia took full control of the city last month. The city
was once home to some 100,000 people but most of its residents are thought to
have fled. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Long motorway queues as go-slow fuel protests startConvoys of protesters are driving slowly on motorways as they call for fuel duty to be cut.,"This video can not be played Watch: Motorways brought to a standstill by fuel price protesters More than a dozen protesters were arrested for driving too slowly during demonstrations on motorways in England, Wales and Scotland over fuel prices. The go-slow action mainly targeted three-lane motorways with convoys of vehicles crawling along two lanes - leaving the ""fast"" outside lane free. Twelve people were arrested during a protest on the M4, which led to the Prince of Wales Bridge, between England and Wales, being closed. Another man was arrested near the A38. Protesters, organised under the social media banner Fuel Price Stand Against Tax, drove in a series of convoys at 30mph (48.3km/h) to cause gridlock on major roads and motorways. Chief Superintendent Tom Harding from Gwent Police said people had been arrested for driving under 30mph for a ""prolonged amount of time"". The roads affected by disruption included: the M4 and Prince of Wales Bridge the M5 in Devon the M32 in Gloucestershire the A38 in Devon the M180 in Lincolnshire the A12 in Essex the A92 in Scotland the A64 near York Gwent Police said organisers of the protest had been given a legal notice to prevent them from blocking the bridge over the River Severn and from driving under 30mph.

Tariq Akram said other cars joined the convoy as it went by Tariq Akram said his was one of 50 vehicles making the 60-mile journey through Scunthorpe and Doncaster at 20mph. The Scunthorpe truck driver told the BBC his company had added Â£4,000 to its fuel bill in the past four months because of rising prices. ""The turnout was absolutely fantastic.

Earlier, Devon and Cornwall Police said it was aware of a go-slow protest heading northbound from Exeter services on the M5. The force also said a further protest began on the A38 heading north from Ivybridge, where a man in his 50s was arrested after ignoring a warning about unsafe driving. ""Unfortunately we have had unsafe driving on the A38 including vehicles travelling at a dangerously low speed,"" a force spokesman said. Why is petrol so expensive in the UK? Fact vs fiction: Five tips for saving petrol money examined Steve Nash, who got stuck on the M5, said the protesters might be ""going about it the wrong way"" Steve Nash, who was delayed on the M5 by protesters as he drove to Exeter Airport to return a hire car, is hopeful the delay will not result in a penalty fee. ""I'm not sure what they're achieving - other than inconveniencing people,"" he said. ""I'm not critical of the sentiment behind what they're trying to do, I just think they're possibly going about it the wrong way."" The retired civil servant from Tiverton said his journey that would usually take 20 minutes took an hour on Monday. He said he felt the protesters should be ""stood outside parliament or writing to their MPs"". ""I think it's not affecting the people you need to actually protest, which is Parliament. The protesters have actually inconvenienced everyone else who is inconvenienced by high fuel prices."" Police Scotland said it had beenaware of protests on motorways and trunk roadsand urged motorists to drive at an appropriate speed for the road conditions. But the force had warned journey times could be longer than normal. In Lincolnshire, police blocked junction one between the M180 and M18 forcing protesters to remain on the former. West Yorkshire Police said a ""single tyre deflation device"" - also known as a ""stinger"" - had been deployed, but it was not used. West Mercia Police said some of the tactics used during a protest on the M54, which had ended by about 08:30 BST, had ""compromised the safety of other road users"" and said officers wouldtake action against those who committed traffic offences. A Facebook event called Stand Up to Fuel Prices, with more than 57,000 responses, had called for people to take their cars, lorries and tractors to cause roadblocks all over the country ""until there is change"". The organisers wrote that fuel costs were driving up other costs of living and said they hoped the more people that joined the protest, the sooner living costs would drop. Fuel prices have risen to record highs in recent weeks with figures from data firm Experian showing the average price of a litre of petrol at UK forecourts had hit 191.5p and 199.0p for diesel on Sunday. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said there did not appear to be any sign of retailers reducing forecourt prices, despite weekly wholesale costs having fallen for five weeks. Chancellor Rishi Sunak has said he will carefully consider calls for a ""more substantial"" fuel duty cut after the 5p per litre reduction implemented in March failed to halt price rises. Rising fuel prices have been pushed even higher by the war in Ukraine, with Russia, one of the world's largest oil exporters, facing sanctions. A convoy of vehicles on the M180 in Lincolnshire Police escort vehicles across the Prince of Wales Bridge, which runs between England and Wales The government had said while it understands people are struggling with rising prices and have a right to protest, ""people's day-to-day lives should not be disrupted"" and warned traffic delays ""will only add to fuel use"". Howard Cox, founder of campaign group FairFuelUK, said other countries had cut fuel duty more than the UK and called for a reduction of at least 20p. While he said his organisation was not involved in the protests, he said there was an appetite for them - and if the government did not deliver on the issue there could be ""some serious escalation of protests"".

Parents asked about change to nursery ratios,"Staff at Yellow Wellies Day Nursery in Durham are worried the changes would reduce quality for two-year-olds Plans to let nurseries and childminders look after more two-year-olds in England are to be put to parents. In England, one adult can be in charge of four children, but the government says it wants to lower the cost for parents by following the Scottish model of one adult caring for five toddlers. Most nurseries say the systems cannot be compared and do not want the change. A mum who has spent more than Â£90,000 in nursery fees in seven years doubts a change would save parents much money. The consultation,externalinto the idea is expected to take eight weeks. Will Quince, the children and families minister, said it was about offering flexibility to early years settings and that he did not want to do anything that ""compromises quality or safety"". He told the BBC the Scottish model was a good one and ""it's only a slight tweak or variation to what we do"". ""But that's exactly why we are consulting because we've got to listen to the sector and, importantly, listen to parents to make sure that whatever we propose we are getting it right."" he added. Nurseries resist staff looking after more children Why free nursery childcare can come with costly extras Mother-of-two Amanda Smallbone, whose younger child attends a Durham nursery, says that as a working parent she already felt guilty about putting her children in someone else's care. But that means she wants them to have the best experience and ""part of that is being part of a smaller group and having that additional care"". Amanda questions how big the savings would actually be. She believes using the new ratios could create a two-tier system for parents - those who can afford paying for the extra costs of lower ratios and ""those who have to be driven by price as they have no other choice"". A full-time nursery place for a child under two now costs, on average, more than Â£14,000 a year in the UK,Coram family and childcare's recent annual survey found.,external In a separate interview with PA news agency, Mr Quince said other countries ""put far more money into early years' education"" - but people ""pay a lot more in tax"". Bridget Phillipson, Labour's shadow secretary of state for education, called the announcement ""pathetic"". ""Tweaking ratios is not the answer parents want and not the answer children need,"" she said. She added that Labour would introduce a ""fourfold increase"" in the early years pupil premium, which is funding given to early years providers for disadvantaged three and four-year-olds. Amanda Smallbone, from Durham, has spent more than Â£90,000 in nursery fees for her two children Most nurseries and pre-schools in England are opposed to the ratio changes andsay the plans will not cut costs for parents. Dr Kate Jones, the owner of Yellow Wellies Day Nursery in Durham, says they probably would not adopt the new ratio, even if the plan was approved. She says the proposal is about ""reducing quality"" for two-year-olds who are just learning how to do things for themselves. ""At lunchtime we have allergies, we have choking risks and usually we have some kind of toileting emergency and that is just with four of them,"" she says. With the nursery trying to retain its best staff and cope with a much larger electricity bill, Dr Jones adds that for parents ""the reduction in fees would not be a reduction, but maintaining at best"". At Little Flyers nursery in Broxburn near Edinburgh, one adult can look after five two-year-olds. Pamela Stein, the learning and development manager, says it is vital that staff have the right skills and resources to be able to provide ""a safe nurturing experience"". She says all their practitioners must complete a certain amount of training every year to maintain their obligatory registration with the Scottish social services council and help ensure that adult-to-child ratio remains safe. In Scotland, one adult can look after five two-year-olds, but providers say the English system is very different. The National Day Nurseries Association, which has members in England and Scotland, says the two systems cannot be compared. It says that in Scotland: more staff have at least a level three qualification in childcare (84%) compared with England (76%) nurseries receive on average more funding per child from local authorities the nurseries are exempt from business rates a larger proportion than in England are run by the local councils, where costs are different Eva Lloyd, a professor of early childhood at the University of East London,who co-authored a research report on the costs of childcare in 2013,externalwhen the ratio change was being considered by the coalition government, says it is ""a dangerous move"" that won't benefit parents, children or the sector. She says the measures being proposed will not make any difference ""until and unless we absolutely address workforce paying conditions head on"". ""We have the most serious recruitment and retention crisis in childcare employees than we've ever had as far as records go, and my prediction would be that even more will leave,"" she added. Meanwhile, the government also says it hopes to increase the number of childminders by allowing them to work from a local community centre or village hall rather than their own home. It says it is working with Ofsted to make it easier for childminders to register and to reduce inspections. The early years foundation stage framework they are expected to follow will be reduced as well. A new drive to target parents who are not taking up existing childcare offers has also been announced.

You can read more in ourlatest news story. These live updates have been brought to you by Jeremy Gahagan, George Wright, Sam Hancock and Catherine Evans. Catherine EvansBBC News Isabella said she had a panic attack after escaping A 13-year-old Harry Styles fan has described how she escaped
from the Fields shopping centre by climbing onto a roof with her grandmother. Isabella Hjertholm from Odense, Denmark, told the BBC: âWhen
we saw people running out of the cinema, at first I didnât think it was
anything serious, until I heard people say somebody were shooting."" âI didnât really know where to exit since I donât know the
mall that well, so I just followed a big group going to some type of rooftop,
and luckily we found an emergency exit,â she said. They ran as far away from the centre as they could, before phoning Isabella's mother and
grandfather, who were hiding in some toilets at the shopping centre. âWe waited at a gas station where we met with my mom and
grandpa later, and then we took a taxi back home,"" she said. ""I was traumatised and really
scared to go anywhere near Fields, plus my mom didnât let me go back there because it
didn't feel safe."" ""When I got back home to my grandma and grandpa I
began having a panic attack... I was really scared,"" she said. Isabella added that she was disappointed that she wouldnât be able to see Harry Styles, but was relieved to find out the show had been cancelled. ""It was the absolute right decision to make. Right now Iâm
hoping for a new date for Harry Styles concert,"" she said. ""I am very thankful
that me and my family are alive. I feel for those who have lost somebody."" Adrienne MurrayReporting from Copenhagen Crisis assistance points and counselling are being offered to the public in Copenhagen today. Only a couple of days ago, the Tour de France started here and there was a celebratory mood as spectators lined the streets. Itâs still unclear how the suspect obtained the murder weapon, and police say they are reviewing social media posts where he posed with weapons. Strict firearm controls are in place and potential gun-owners must pass a background check before being eligible for a licence. Although it's thought the suspect acted alone, police are keeping a visible presence across the capital. The attack in Denmark comes less than two weeks after agunman opened fire in Oslo, in neighbouring Norway, and Norwegian PM Jonas Gahr Stoere says he understands people's fears - but leaders are doing ""everything we can to keep us safe [sic]"". ""This is the most important task for the government at any time. And then each of us must take care of those around us and extend a hand to those who are now extra scared,"" he says in a statement, adding: There is still a lot we don't know about why the perpetrators in Oslo and Copenhagen committed the terrible acts, but regardless of the motive and background, our answer must be clear: we stand together in the face of violence and hatred. We are strengthened in our faith in community and love.""  Gahr Stoere also says Scandinavian countries are working to strengthen the goal of ""creating safe communities that prevent mental illness and radicalization"", though he doesn't give any detail on what's actually being done. ""My thoughts are with the victims, their relatives and to all those who are currently working to save lives and keep the population safe,"" the leader adds. Adrienne MurrayReporting from Copenhagen Dozens of heavily armed officers have been standing guard outside the Fieldâs shopping centre all morning, while investigators have been filing in and out. The steps to the main entrance remain cordoned off with tape, and police vehicles line the street outside. This is a smart office district on the outskirts of Copenhagen, but today the surroundings are quiet. At the weekend this area would have been particularly busy. The mall is a popular spot for families and young people, and at the time of the shooting, thousands of music fans were making their way to the Royal Arena concert hall, to see Harry Styles perform. For this small Nordic country, where gun violence is rare and mass shootings are almost unheard of, Sundayâs events are deeply shocking. A 16-year-old girl Harry Styles fan who was injured in Sunday's shooting has described how she came face to face with the gunman. The Swedish national, who is in a stable condition, spoke to Swedish media outlet Kristiansbladet from her hospital bed this morning. She said she's waiting to have fragments and a bullet removed from her body. The teenager was due to attend the Harry Styles concert nearby and had only been in the centre for a few minutes when the gunman opened fire. She managed to run away before she could feel a heat spread and heard a bang. ""Then I realised I had been hit,"" she said. ""I turned my head and saw the perpetrator for a few seconds."" Despite being hit, she managed to escape, getting help from people and ambulance crews outside the centre. More than 100 people are said to have contacted the Red Cross' victim counselling service in Denmark on Sunday night after the shooting at Field's shopping centre. Mikkel Wendelboe Toft, a consultant in national preparedness at the Red Cross, tells Danish news agency Ritzau that the service is hearing from people who've suffered ""great, violent experiences"". ""These are people who have been in direct visual contact in the moment out there,"" he's quoted as saying, adding that those who get away can often be left traumatised. ""There are people who have had escape experiences and have had to run away with children under their arms or have hidden in the centre."" Earlier, eyewitness Maximillian von Rentelndescribed his ""terrifying"" experienceof being just outside the mall when gunfire begun. He said dozens of people, including him, then ran as fast as they could to the nearest point of safety. This video can not be played People flee Field's shopping centre following the attack The shooting was carried out at Field's shopping centre, a popular destination for families and young Danes We've heard lots about the fallout from yesterday's gun attack in Copenhagen, but just how common is this kind of ambush in Denmark? The short answer is not very. The last time a militant attack was carried out in the Scandinavian country was February 2015, when a 22-year-old man opened fire on two separate occasions across the same day in Copenhagen. He killed two people in total and wounded six police officers. The perpetrator began shooting at the Krudttoenden cultural centre, during a freedom of speech event, before going on to shoot someone outside a Jewish synagogue in the city centre. He was eventually shot dead by police. At the time, local and international media branded it the ""worst attack on Danish soil for decades,external"". Betty Kandindima, from the Danish Broadcasting Corporation in
Copenhagen, told BBC Radio 5 Live earlier that the main difference between the two incidents was the police's ability to stop the suspect this time around. With that incident [in 2015], the suspect was walking around in the streets of Copenhagen for quite some time which meant the police actually had to barricade most of the city centre, whereasâ¦ itâs [this latest attack] in the outskirts of Copenhagen, approximately 10km from the city centre, which meant that this time around the police they had an easier time cutting off the area to find the suspect."" Betty Kandindima A picture has emerged of the alleged gunman inside Field's mall. It shows a man wearing shorts and a short-sleeved dark top, carrying what appears to be a weapon. The picture is from a video, which shows the man stopping momentarily, resting the apparent weapon on his shoulder, before starting to run through the shopping complex. Officials have just been holding a press conference outside the Rigshospitalet, where three of the seriously injured victims were taken. They were given ""life-saving treatment"" very quickly, chief physician Anders Damm said, according to the Jyllands-Posten newspaper. Of the three being treated there, two are in a stable condition. The third remains in a critical condition but further details were not given. A fourth gunshot victim is being treated at the Herlev Hospital, but is reported not to be in a critical condition. More now from Copenhagen's police chief, who has been explaining how the shooter targeted victims at random. Soeren Thomassen said police do not believe the attack was an act of terror and that the suspect has a history of mental health issues. ""It is important for me to underline that in the work we've been doing throughout the night there is nothing that indicates that the suspect that we apprehended has been together with others or has been helped by others. ""Our assessment is that the victims are random victims. That it is not motivated by gender or anything else."" British singer Harry Styles has said he is ""heartbroken"" following yesterday's deadly shopping centre attack in Copenhagen, which took place less than a mile from where he was due to play to fans on Sunday evening. The 28-year-old former One Direction star's concert was cancelled following the attack. Many fans had already gathered at the Royal Arena when the venue was evacuated. Posting to his verified Twitter account, Styles shared his love for the Danish capital and its residents, saying that he was ""heartbroken"" at the news. ""Iâm devastated for the victims, their families, and everyone hurting. ""Iâm sorry we couldnât be together. Please look after each other."" Allow Twitter content?

Police say the shooter was armed with a rifle, a pistol and a knife, and while the guns are not believed to be illegal, the suspect did not have a licence for them. But what are Denmark's gun laws? Denmark has restrictive gun laws that are regulated by the Ministry of Justice and the European Commission. Civilians are banned from owning full automatic firearms, while semi-automatic weapons and handguns are only allowed with special authorisation, according to Gun Policy, a group focused on gun control. Applicants for a gun ownerâs licence are required to establish a genuine reason to possess a firearm, for example hunting or target shooting. An applicant for a licence must pass a background check which considers criminal and mental health records. Eyewitness Maximillian von Renteln says police boarded a bus he escaped to, causing many to panic Let's hear from an eyewitness now. Maximillian von Renteln, who says he was ""just outside"" the
Field's shopping centre yesterday when he heard loud gun shots, has described the attack as terrifying. ""At
the time, I didnât think they were gunshots but just a while after I saw people
running out â and I instinctively did the same,"" he tells the BBC. Citing footage he captured on his mobile phone, Maximillian adds that a bus he managed to escape to was later boarded by armed police who instructed passengers to put their hands in the air. A man with a backpack, sitting at the back of the bus, was searched but officers found nothing and soon went on their way. âEveryone was in shock, no one knew what was happening. There were kids on board,"" Maximillian says. Despite this, he insists that the police did a good - and swift - job. ""Iâm happy with the police and how quickly they respondedâ¦ especially when you compare it to asituation like the [shooting] in Texas recently.â Danish journalist Lone Thelis says gun laws in the country are strict, leaving many puzzled about yesterday's attack In the last few minutes, Danish journalist Lone Thelis has been speaking to the BBC, saying the mood today in Copenhagen is one of ""shock and great sadness"". There is also ""disbelief"" that such an attack could take place in Denmark, she says. Asked why the 22-year-old gunman might have targeted the Field's shopping centre, Lone says details are still unknown. But, she adds, police in Denmark ""raided"" an apartment in the area last night and believe it to be the ""perpetrator's"" - meaning the explanation could be as simple as geography. Copenhagen has ""pretty strict"" gun laws, she adds, which is why many are so confused by yesterday's attack. ""You can't just go into a shop and get yourself a gun, you need to have permission. If you need a rifle for hunting, for instance, you need to do an exam,"" she says. ""That's definitely something the police will be interested in finding out - how did [the gunman] get the weapon?"" Sunday's attack took place at one of Denmark's biggest shopping centres. The Field's multi-storey shopping mall in the south of Copenhagen has more than 140 shops and restaurants and is located on the outskirts of the capital, near a subway line that connects it to the city centre. Less than a mile away is the Royal Arena, the 17,000-capacity venue where Harry Styles was due to perform on Sunday before the show was cancelled. There is a high school in the vicinity of the shopping centre, as well as a large student housing block where hundreds of young people on university exchange programmes live. Copenhagen airport is a short train ride away, as is the Ãresund Bridge, which connects Denmark to the Swedish city of MalmÃ¶. Footage on social media shows scenes of panic as people flee gunfire inside the shopping centre. You might find the content upsetting. This video can not be played The three people killed in Sunday's shooting have been identified as a Danish woman and man, both aged 17, and a 47-year-old Russian citizen residing in Denmark, Danish police say. Another four were injured in the shooting: two Danish women, aged 19 and 40, and two Swedish citizens, a 50-year-old man and a 16-year-old girl, Copenhagen police chief Soeren Thomassen says. He told reporters that police do not believe the attack was terror-related. Videos of the suspect circulating on social media are believed to be authentic, police say. The man can be seen posing with weapons, mimicking suicide gestures and talking about psychiatric medication ""that does not work"". More now from a press conference being held by police in Copenhagen. The city's police chief, Soeren Thomassen, says the suspect was known to mental health services. ""Our suspect is also known among psychiatric services, beyond that I do not wish to comment,"" Thomassen says. The victims appeared to have been randomly targeted and there was nothing to indicate it was an act of terror, he adds. Four people, including two Swedish citizens, are in critical
condition but stable after being hit by gunshots in the shooting on Sunday, where three people
were killed, the police chief says. Danish police say there is no indication that Sunday's shooting was an act of terror. The suspect had a history of mental health issues, they say. Â© 2025 BBC.

Catherine EvansBBC News Isabella said she had a panic attack after escaping A 13-year-old Harry Styles fan has described how she escaped
from the Fields shopping centre by climbing onto a roof with her grandmother. Isabella Hjertholm from Odense, Denmark, told the BBC: âWhen
we saw people running out of the cinema, at first I didnât think it was
anything serious, until I heard people say somebody were shooting."" âI didnât really know where to exit since I donât know the
mall that well, so I just followed a big group going to some type of rooftop,
and luckily we found an emergency exit,â she said. They ran as far away from the centre as they could, before phoning Isabella's mother and
grandfather, who were hiding in some toilets at the shopping centre. âWe waited at a gas station where we met with my mom and
grandpa later, and then we took a taxi back home,"" she said. ""I was traumatised and really
scared to go anywhere near Fields, plus my mom didnât let me go back there because it
didn't feel safe."" ""When I got back home to my grandma and grandpa I
began having a panic attack... I was really scared,"" she said. Isabella added that she was disappointed that she wouldnât be able to see Harry Styles, but was relieved to find out the show had been cancelled. ""It was the absolute right decision to make. Right now Iâm
hoping for a new date for Harry Styles concert,"" she said. ""I am very thankful
that me and my family are alive. I feel for those who have lost somebody."" Adrienne MurrayReporting from Copenhagen Crisis assistance points and counselling are being offered to the public in Copenhagen today. Only a couple of days ago, the Tour de France started here and there was a celebratory mood as spectators lined the streets. Itâs still unclear how the suspect obtained the murder weapon, and police say they are reviewing social media posts where he posed with weapons. Strict firearm controls are in place and potential gun-owners must pass a background check before being eligible for a licence. Although it's thought the suspect acted alone, police are keeping a visible presence across the capital. The attack in Denmark comes less than two weeks after agunman opened fire in Oslo, in neighbouring Norway, and Norwegian PM Jonas Gahr Stoere says he understands people's fears - but leaders are doing ""everything we can to keep us safe [sic]"". ""This is the most important task for the government at any time. And then each of us must take care of those around us and extend a hand to those who are now extra scared,"" he says in a statement, adding: There is still a lot we don't know about why the perpetrators in Oslo and Copenhagen committed the terrible acts, but regardless of the motive and background, our answer must be clear: we stand together in the face of violence and hatred. We are strengthened in our faith in community and love.""  Gahr Stoere also says Scandinavian countries are working to strengthen the goal of ""creating safe communities that prevent mental illness and radicalization"", though he doesn't give any detail on what's actually being done. ""My thoughts are with the victims, their relatives and to all those who are currently working to save lives and keep the population safe,"" the leader adds. Adrienne MurrayReporting from Copenhagen Dozens of heavily armed officers have been standing guard outside the Fieldâs shopping centre all morning, while investigators have been filing in and out. The steps to the main entrance remain cordoned off with tape, and police vehicles line the street outside. This is a smart office district on the outskirts of Copenhagen, but today the surroundings are quiet. At the weekend this area would have been particularly busy. The mall is a popular spot for families and young people, and at the time of the shooting, thousands of music fans were making their way to the Royal Arena concert hall, to see Harry Styles perform. For this small Nordic country, where gun violence is rare and mass shootings are almost unheard of, Sundayâs events are deeply shocking. A 16-year-old girl Harry Styles fan who was injured in Sunday's shooting has described how she came face to face with the gunman. The Swedish national, who is in a stable condition, spoke to Swedish media outlet Kristiansbladet from her hospital bed this morning. She said she's waiting to have fragments and a bullet removed from her body. The teenager was due to attend the Harry Styles concert nearby and had only been in the centre for a few minutes when the gunman opened fire. She managed to run away before she could feel a heat spread and heard a bang. ""Then I realised I had been hit,"" she said. ""I turned my head and saw the perpetrator for a few seconds."" Despite being hit, she managed to escape, getting help from people and ambulance crews outside the centre. More than 100 people are said to have contacted the Red Cross' victim counselling service in Denmark on Sunday night after the shooting at Field's shopping centre. Mikkel Wendelboe Toft, a consultant in national preparedness at the Red Cross, tells Danish news agency Ritzau that the service is hearing from people who've suffered ""great, violent experiences"". ""These are people who have been in direct visual contact in the moment out there,"" he's quoted as saying, adding that those who get away can often be left traumatised. ""There are people who have had escape experiences and have had to run away with children under their arms or have hidden in the centre."" Earlier, eyewitness Maximillian von Rentelndescribed his ""terrifying"" experienceof being just outside the mall when gunfire begun. He said dozens of people, including him, then ran as fast as they could to the nearest point of safety. This video can not be played People flee Field's shopping centre following the attack The shooting was carried out at Field's shopping centre, a popular destination for families and young Danes We've heard lots about the fallout from yesterday's gun attack in Copenhagen, but just how common is this kind of ambush in Denmark? The short answer is not very. The last time a militant attack was carried out in the Scandinavian country was February 2015, when a 22-year-old man opened fire on two separate occasions across the same day in Copenhagen. He killed two people in total and wounded six police officers. The perpetrator began shooting at the Krudttoenden cultural centre, during a freedom of speech event, before going on to shoot someone outside a Jewish synagogue in the city centre. He was eventually shot dead by police. At the time, local and international media branded it the ""worst attack on Danish soil for decades,external"". Betty Kandindima, from the Danish Broadcasting Corporation in
Copenhagen, told BBC Radio 5 Live earlier that the main difference between the two incidents was the police's ability to stop the suspect this time around. With that incident [in 2015], the suspect was walking around in the streets of Copenhagen for quite some time which meant the police actually had to barricade most of the city centre, whereasâ¦ itâs [this latest attack] in the outskirts of Copenhagen, approximately 10km from the city centre, which meant that this time around the police they had an easier time cutting off the area to find the suspect."" Betty Kandindima A picture has emerged of the alleged gunman inside Field's mall. It shows a man wearing shorts and a short-sleeved dark top, carrying what appears to be a weapon. The picture is from a video, which shows the man stopping momentarily, resting the apparent weapon on his shoulder, before starting to run through the shopping complex. Officials have just been holding a press conference outside the Rigshospitalet, where three of the seriously injured victims were taken. They were given ""life-saving treatment"" very quickly, chief physician Anders Damm said, according to the Jyllands-Posten newspaper. Of the three being treated there, two are in a stable condition. The third remains in a critical condition but further details were not given. A fourth gunshot victim is being treated at the Herlev Hospital, but is reported not to be in a critical condition. More now from Copenhagen's police chief, who has been explaining how the shooter targeted victims at random. Soeren Thomassen said police do not believe the attack was an act of terror and that the suspect has a history of mental health issues. ""It is important for me to underline that in the work we've been doing throughout the night there is nothing that indicates that the suspect that we apprehended has been together with others or has been helped by others. ""Our assessment is that the victims are random victims. That it is not motivated by gender or anything else."" British singer Harry Styles has said he is ""heartbroken"" following yesterday's deadly shopping centre attack in Copenhagen, which took place less than a mile from where he was due to play to fans on Sunday evening. The 28-year-old former One Direction star's concert was cancelled following the attack. Many fans had already gathered at the Royal Arena when the venue was evacuated. Posting to his verified Twitter account, Styles shared his love for the Danish capital and its residents, saying that he was ""heartbroken"" at the news. ""Iâm devastated for the victims, their families, and everyone hurting. ""Iâm sorry we couldnât be together. Please look after each other."" Allow Twitter content?

Police say the shooter was armed with a rifle, a pistol and a knife, and while the guns are not believed to be illegal, the suspect did not have a licence for them. But what are Denmark's gun laws? Denmark has restrictive gun laws that are regulated by the Ministry of Justice and the European Commission. Civilians are banned from owning full automatic firearms, while semi-automatic weapons and handguns are only allowed with special authorisation, according to Gun Policy, a group focused on gun control. Applicants for a gun ownerâs licence are required to establish a genuine reason to possess a firearm, for example hunting or target shooting. An applicant for a licence must pass a background check which considers criminal and mental health records. Eyewitness Maximillian von Renteln says police boarded a bus he escaped to, causing many to panic Let's hear from an eyewitness now. Maximillian von Renteln, who says he was ""just outside"" the
Field's shopping centre yesterday when he heard loud gun shots, has described the attack as terrifying. ""At
the time, I didnât think they were gunshots but just a while after I saw people
running out â and I instinctively did the same,"" he tells the BBC. Citing footage he captured on his mobile phone, Maximillian adds that a bus he managed to escape to was later boarded by armed police who instructed passengers to put their hands in the air. A man with a backpack, sitting at the back of the bus, was searched but officers found nothing and soon went on their way. âEveryone was in shock, no one knew what was happening. There were kids on board,"" Maximillian says. Despite this, he insists that the police did a good - and swift - job. ""Iâm happy with the police and how quickly they respondedâ¦ especially when you compare it to asituation like the [shooting] in Texas recently.â Danish journalist Lone Thelis says gun laws in the country are strict, leaving many puzzled about yesterday's attack In the last few minutes, Danish journalist Lone Thelis has been speaking to the BBC, saying the mood today in Copenhagen is one of ""shock and great sadness"". There is also ""disbelief"" that such an attack could take place in Denmark, she says. Asked why the 22-year-old gunman might have targeted the Field's shopping centre, Lone says details are still unknown. But, she adds, police in Denmark ""raided"" an apartment in the area last night and believe it to be the ""perpetrator's"" - meaning the explanation could be as simple as geography. Copenhagen has ""pretty strict"" gun laws, she adds, which is why many are so confused by yesterday's attack. ""You can't just go into a shop and get yourself a gun, you need to have permission. If you need a rifle for hunting, for instance, you need to do an exam,"" she says. ""That's definitely something the police will be interested in finding out - how did [the gunman] get the weapon?"" Sunday's attack took place at one of Denmark's biggest shopping centres. The Field's multi-storey shopping mall in the south of Copenhagen has more than 140 shops and restaurants and is located on the outskirts of the capital, near a subway line that connects it to the city centre. Less than a mile away is the Royal Arena, the 17,000-capacity venue where Harry Styles was due to perform on Sunday before the show was cancelled. There is a high school in the vicinity of the shopping centre, as well as a large student housing block where hundreds of young people on university exchange programmes live. Copenhagen airport is a short train ride away, as is the Ãresund Bridge, which connects Denmark to the Swedish city of MalmÃ¶. Footage on social media shows scenes of panic as people flee gunfire inside the shopping centre. You might find the content upsetting. This video can not be played The three people killed in Sunday's shooting have been identified as a Danish woman and man, both aged 17, and a 47-year-old Russian citizen residing in Denmark, Danish police say. Another four were injured in the shooting: two Danish women, aged 19 and 40, and two Swedish citizens, a 50-year-old man and a 16-year-old girl, Copenhagen police chief Soeren Thomassen says. He told reporters that police do not believe the attack was terror-related. Videos of the suspect circulating on social media are believed to be authentic, police say. The man can be seen posing with weapons, mimicking suicide gestures and talking about psychiatric medication ""that does not work"". More now from a press conference being held by police in Copenhagen. The city's police chief, Soeren Thomassen, says the suspect was known to mental health services. ""Our suspect is also known among psychiatric services, beyond that I do not wish to comment,"" Thomassen says. The victims appeared to have been randomly targeted and there was nothing to indicate it was an act of terror, he adds. Four people, including two Swedish citizens, are in critical
condition but stable after being hit by gunshots in the shooting on Sunday, where three people
were killed, the police chief says. Danish police say there is no indication that Sunday's shooting was an act of terror. The suspect had a history of mental health issues, they say. Â© 2025 BBC.

Court cases 'in limbo' due to barristers' strike,"Barristers gathered outside the Royal Courts of Justice in London Criminal cases in courts across England and Wales face disruption for a second week as barristers pledge to extend their strike action into August. Rallies have taken outside the Royal Courts of Justice, in London, plus Liverpool and Birmingham Crown Courts. Members of the Criminal Bar Association have rejected the government's 15% pay offer, saying it will not kick in immediately or apply to existing cases. Ministers blame the strikes for worseninga backlog of 58,000 cases. But the Criminal Bar Association says long-term legal-aid cuts are the cause. The CBA is asking for a 25% rise in pay for legal aid work, representing people who could not otherwise afford lawyers. It says some junior barristers currently make less than the hourly minimum wage. Ministers say a typical criminal barrister would get Â£7,000 more a year under the offer, adding that before expenses, median earnings for criminal barristers in 2019-20 were Â£79,800, although it admits junior barristers often earn a fraction of this. Strike leaves defendants facing court delays Barristers walk out of courts over pay Criminal barristers vote to strike over pay rates The CBA's four weeks of action escalates to a three-day walk-out this week, increasing by one day a week to a five-day strike from 18 July - and from August, barristers will strike on alternate weeks. Ministers say the number of backlogged cases is coming down, due to government initiatives - but say the strikes will lead to more delays and more people waiting for justice. ""Our energetic efforts to tackle the courts backlog are working but the strike action by criminal barristers threatens all that progress, despite the very generous pay offer on the table,"" argues Justice Minister James Cartlidge. But the CBA says a 28% cut in legal aid fees over the past decade has forced barristers out of the sector, with their numbers down a quarter compared to five years ago. This video can not be played Two young lawyers share their concerns about the profession ""There are simply too few criminal justice barristers to prosecute, to defend and even to provide the judges the government relies on and the public expects to be there, to crack a record backlog and ensure victims of crime and the accused are not left in agonising limbo,"" said a CBA spokesperson. ""The criminal justice system has been grinding to a halt for a number of years, not because of us but because the government has simply mismanaged the system and underfunded it considerably,"" said CBA chairman Jo Sidhu. The CBA says its own analysis of government figures suggests that in the year to March 2022 more  than 1,000 criminal trials were postponed at the last moment because there was no prosecuting or defence barrister available. Solicitors working in the criminal justice system have told the BBC they face similar problems. ""We believe the years of underfunding have lead to a crisis in the criminal justice system,"" said Hashem Puri, president of the London Criminal Courts Solicitors Association. ""Large numbers of barristers and criminal solicitors are leaving the profession because of the low pay... ""Our members are considering taking similar action and joining the bar in days of action.""

Australian PM pledges more aid on Ukraine visit,"The visit to Ukraine was the first by any Australian prime minister Australian Prime Minister Anthony Albanese has pledged more military aid to Ukraine after visiting the war-torn nation's capital. The prime minister met President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv during a surprise trip on Sunday. He earlier toured the devastated towns of Bucha and Irpin, describing what he saw as a ""war crime"". The aid package, worth 100m Australian dollars ($68m; Â£56m), includes drones and 34 additional armoured vehicles. Mr Albanese also announced sanctions and travel bans on a further 16 Russian ministers and oligarchs and an end to imports of Russian gold. He says he saw first-hand ""the devastation and trauma"" inflicted on Ukraine on his visit. Thousands of Ukranians have been killed and towns destroyed since the invasion began on February 24. The prime minister lit a candle for civilians buried in a mass grave in Bucha, where Russian forces are accused of committing atrocities. And in Irpin he described what he saw as ""devastating"". ""Here we have what [is] clearly a residential building,"" Mr Albanese said. ""Another one just behind it, brutally assaulted. This is a war crime."" Can we say how many people have died in Ukraine? Welsh journalist shares photos of Ukraine horrors No quick return to normal for scarred Bucha In a press conference at the Presidential Palace in Kyiv, Mr Albanese said his country will support Ukraine for ""as long as it takes"". The extra aid announced brings total Australian assistance to Ukraine to about $390 million. Australia is also considering reopening its embassy in the country, following the lead of other nations such as the UK and US. Mr Albanese joins a long list of world leaders who have visited Ukraine since the war began. The unannounced visit came after a week-long trip to Europe, where Mr Albanese attended a NATO summit in Madrid and met French President Emmanuel Macron in Paris.
