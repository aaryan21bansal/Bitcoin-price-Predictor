Hoffman, 40, sank nine birdies in a seven-under-par 65 to lead from compatriot William McGirt. Lee Westwood is third on two under, one ahead of fellow Englishmen Justin Rose, Andy Sullivan and Matt Fitzpatrick. Northern Ireland's Rory McIlroy rallied with three late birdies in a 72, while 2015 champion Jordan Spieth carded 75. England's defending champion Danny Willett started his defence with a double bogey and a bogey before fighting back to finish one over par. World number one Dustin Johnsonpulled out on the first teeafter injuring his back when slipping on the stairs at his rental house on Wednesday. How the drama unfolded on day one of the Masters Second round tee-times How to follow the Masters on the BBC Scoring was expected to be tough at Augusta with high winds forecast to become even stronger as the opening day progressed. And that proved to be the case as it became a distinct possibility that no player would shoot under 70 in the opening round for the first time in 60 years. But the tricky conditions proved little obstacle for McGirt and, particularly, Hoffman, who were the only players to score in the 60s. Hoffman has only previously claimed one top-25 finish at a major, tying for ninth at the 2015 Masters, but put together a remarkable round. The world number 52 closed the front nine with two birdies to move two under, then blitzed the back nine with a five-under 31 which included four straight birdies. The Californian almost made it five on the last, only to see a 16-foot putt fall agonisingly short. Nevertheless, his four-shot lead is the biggest first-round advantage at Augusta since 1941. ""The putts started going in the hole - as simple as that sounds,"" he said. ""I kept hitting my spots and in the wind I ended up getting 20 footers and I got some of them down the stretch."" McGirt has only won one PGA Tour title in his 13-year professional career McGirt, making his Masters debut, became the first player to break 70 with four birdies and a bogey in a three-under 69. The 37-year-old from South Carolina does not have much previous pedigree in the majors, having missed the cut at the US Open and the Open in 2016 before earning a 10th-place finish at last year's PGA Championship. ""It was pretty darn special. Any time to break 70 here is awesome,"" said McGirt, who is ranked a place below Hoffman at 53rd in the world. ""The few times I came down here to play in practice the wind direction was the same so this was not new to me today. ""I'm lucky enough to know a few members here and I've spoken to a few caddies and they've been happy to share their knowledge with me."" Defending champion Willett is one of a record 11 English players in the 93-strong field at Augusta, but made a nightmare start to his defence with a double bogey and a bogey in the opening two holes. Birdies on three and 10, with six successive pars sandwiched in-between, steadied the Yorkshireman's scorecard and a superb eagle on the par-five 13th moved him level par for the first time. However, a bogey on the 18th pushed him back over par. ""Battling back from three over even if it was flat and calm round this place would have been great,"" said the world number 17, who has not won a tournament since claiming the Green Jacket. ""We gathered ourselves after probably the worst start we could have wished for. A score of 73 seemed like a good score."" On returning to the scene of his greatest triumph for the first time, he added: ""The memories came flooding back. To be anywhere defending a title is incredible but to be here at Augusta National is amazing - at least once in your life, but it would be nice to do it a couple of times."" Willett became the first Englishman to win the Masters in 20 years when he overhauled Spieth 12 months ago, and a number of his compatriots are in close contention as they aim to repeat his feat. Fitzpatrick, the 22-year-old from Sheffield, led for a short period at three under before a double bogey on the 18th dropped him back into the pack also containing Sullivan and Rose. Westwood, 43, surged into third place with five straight birdies on the back nine as he continued his search for a first major title. World number two McIlroy, 27, is aiming to become only the sixth man to win all four majors - at his third time of trying at Augusta. This video can not be played Rory McIlroy lies seven shots behind leader Charley Hoffman after round one of the Masters McIlroy is seeking a first Masters title following victories at the US Open, the Open Championship and the US PGA Championship. And, after three consecutive top-10 finishes in Georgia, he has made no secret that finally winning the Green Jacket is his main priority. The Northern Irishman made a scruffy start to his opening round, however, dropping three shots without making a birdie on the front nine. Gutsy par putts on 10, 11 and 12 prevented him dropping further adrift, setting the platform to haul himself back to level par with three birdies in the final six holes. ""After nine holes if someone had said I would shoot even par I would have ripped their hand off,"" he said. Two-time major winner Jordan Spieth is hoping to banish memories of last year's spectacular final-day collapse by winning his second Masters. The American, 23, led by five shots as he approached the 10th in 2016, only to drop six shots in three holes - including a quadruple bogey seven at the 12th - and allow England's Willett to take advantage. He was putting together an encouraging first round on Thursday until another quadruple bogey wrecked his card, although at three over par he is still in contention. Spieth was among the leaders heading into Amen Corner, coming through the tough trio of 11, 12 and 13 unscathed. He found the green on the iconic par-three 12th to huge cheers, then birdied the par-five 13th to move into a 13-man share of the lead at one under. ""I was relieved to see it down and on the green,"" he said of his tee shot on 12. ""And I guess everybody else felt maybe more than I did on it."" But his opening-day challenge faded quickly as a bogey on the 14th was followed by a nine on the par-five 15th. Spieth's approach fizzed back off the green into the water and, after taking a penalty drop, he knocked his fifth shot over the back, then hit a poor chip before needing three putts from 30 feet. ""It was nice to make a three at 12 and then four at the next,"" he added. ""I really thought we had it going there and just made a club choice mistake on 15 but we're still in the tournament."" Belgium's Thomas Pieters - considered one of the rising stars on the European Tour - was one of the few players who managed to tame Augusta early on Thursday. He moved into an early four-shot lead on his Masters debut, rattling in five birdies in his opening 10 holes. Then, the 25-year-old came unstuck at Amen Corner. He signed for his first bogey at Augusta by three-putting on the 11th, but worse was soon to follow at the 12th. Pieters dunked his tee-shot into Rae's Creek - the water hazard guarding the narrow green - before knocking on and needing two putts for a double bogey. And another double bogey at the last dropped him back to level par alongside McIlroy, Ireland's Shane Lowry, England's Paul Casey and four-time major winner Ernie Els. Iain Carter, BBC golf correspondent at Augusta: ""This was a day not to play yourself out of the Masters. ""Today, you couldn't win the tournament but you could lose it. ""All of the players that have battled to around par have kept themselves in it.""

Leicestershire deducted 16 points,"Shreck took 1-42 from 21 overs in the game against Loughborough in March Leicestershire have been deducted 16 County Championship points for repeated disciplinary offences. Bowler Charlie Shreck was found guilty of ""using language that is obscene, offensive or insulting and/or making an obscene gesture"" in a pre-season match against Loughborough MCCU in March. The county's fifth offence in 12 months triggered the automatic punishment. Captain Mark Cosgrove, in charge for each of the indiscretions, has been banned for one Championship match. The punishment means that Leicestershire, who finished seventh in Division Two in 2016, will begin the season on minus 16 points. Their campaign begins on Fridayat home to Nottinghamshire. The club have also been fined Â£5,000 and given a further eight-point penalty suspended for 12 months. Fast bowler Shreck, 39, has been given a two-match suspension by the county. Cosgrove pleaded guilty to the charges and is set to serve his suspension in a fortnight's time, in the Championship match against Glamorgan which starts on 21 April. ""We've got to get better and be more disciplined - 16 points is a big deal to us. It's a game,"" Cosgrove told BBC Radio Leicester. ""Hopefully we can get some positive points on the board. This hurts the boys. We need to learn and get better. ""Charlie is very disappointed and very apologetic. He overstepped the mark. He knows he did the wrong thing. ""We've just got to take it and move on and get busy into the season."" In August 2015, Leicestershire were deducted 16 points and given a suspended fine forsimilar breaches. In a statement from the cricket discipline commission on Friday, it was ""noted that actions taken by the club since the previous disciplinary panel hearing have not been effective"". Durham begin their Division Two campaign on minus 48 points, the England and Wales Cricket Board having imposed the penalty because ofthe county's financial problems. Meanwhile, Leicestershire opener Harry Dearden has signed a one-year contract extension, Aadil Ali has agreed a new deal until 2019 and academy batsman Sam Evans has signed a three-year deal - his first professional contract.

The 24-year-old coach plotting a cup upset,"Carl Forster replaced James Coyle as Whitehaven head coach in September 2016 One of British sport's youngest professional head coaches is hoping to make his mark in rugby league's oldest cup competition. At 24, Carl Forster has only been playing as a professional for seven years, but he wasgiven the job as head coachwhen Whitehaven were relegated to England's third tier in 2016. And now he is hoping to draw on the fountain of youth when his League 1 side aim to cause an upset against Championship team Halifax in the fifth round of the Challenge Cup. The tie, to be played at Whitehaven's Recreation Ground, has been chosen to be streamed live on the BBC Sport website on Sunday, 23 April (15:00 BST). It is part of a commitment by BBC Get Inspired to, in the early rounds, put the focus on clubs who do not often get the chance to share the limelight with some of the game's giants. ""We can't wait for this tie,"" said former Salford and St Helens prop Forster. ""It'll be a real chance to see how far we have come in the last few months."" Forster (left) featured in Super League for Salford last season Whitehaven turned heads when they appointed Forster as player-coach after last season's relegation campaign. He is one of the youngest players in his own squad. But the Cumbrian side have a strong start in 2017, beating Oxford in round four and South Wales in the league, while they also pushed high-flying Toronto Wolfpack close in their most recent league outing. Forster continued: ""My age has created a bit of publicity. There are a lot of people talking about it. But for me it's not an issue. Nobody within our group talks about it. ""The job has been good. It's come with its struggles, especially in pre-season. But as soon as the competitive games have started, it's been going well."" Challenge Cup fifth-round draw details Now Forster's aim is to add to the collection of magical Challenge Cup memories that began with the 2002 final when he was just nine years old. ""My first memory was, as a St Helens fan, watching us in the final at Murrayfield when we got beaten by Wigan,"" he said. ""Then I was at the first game back at the new Wembley in 2007 when James Roby scored the first try there. ""Later I was in a St Helens squad that had a good cup run, playing in the early rounds. But now I'm just concentrating on doing a good job here.""

Do Labour's sums add up on free school meals?,"The claim:The Independent Schools Council says Labour's plan to fund free school meals for all primary school children in England by charging VAT on private school fees doesn't add up financially. Reality Check verdict:Unless increased fees led to large numbers of children switching from private to state schools, there's no reason Labour's plans would not work financially. Jeremy Corbyn says Labour would provide a free school meal for every primary school child in England, which he would fund by charging VAT on private school fees. The Independent Schools Council (ISC), which represents private schools, says Mr Corbyn's sums don't add up. At the moment, every primary school child up to about the age of seven - Year 2 - automatically gets a free lunch at school. After this point, eligibility depends on whether families receive certain benefits. About 15% of primary school children in Years 3-6 currently receive a free school meal. Think tank the Institute for Fiscal Studies estimated in 2012 that the total cost of providing free school meals to all primary school pupils in England would be an extra Â£1bn per year. Since 2012, inflation will have increased that figure. But using figures from 2015-16, Mr Corbyn has a slightly lower estimate of Â£900m. The calculation assumes that not every child would take up their free lunch. About 7% of English school children attend private schools. The Independent Schools Council represents about 80% of all the private schools across the UK. In England, their 1,217 schools educate 474,687 children. The average annual fee across the UK, as listed by schools, is Â£16,119. That would equate to a total fee income in England of Â£7.65bn a year. Add 20% VAT and you raise a sum of about Â£1.53bn - much more than the IFS's estimate for the cost of the policy. That assumes that all pupils pay a full fee. The ISC says a third of pupils at its member schools are on reduced fees. That help is worth about Â£850m a year across the UK, reducing the total fee income and thus the VAT take. Another potential reduction might be if non-UK resident parents are able to claim back VAT. Visitors to the UK can claim back VAT on certain goods and services and it's unclear whether school fees would be included in this list. But the ISC doesn't represent all schools - the total number of privately educated pupils in England is about 570,000. That's more potential VAT take. However, raising tax also creates behaviour change - with an increased cost some parents would no longer send their child to a private school. It's difficult at the moment to quantify how big this effect might be. But as shown above, Labour have left themselves a large leeway. If there was a large exodus from private to state schools, the plan would become less viable. An ISC spokeswoman says: ""A third of pupils at our schools are on reduced fees and are from families where both parents work hard to pay the fees. If this measure was introduced smaller independent schools might close, driving more children back to be funded in the state system."" The tax take would drop with each pupil leaving the private system. There would also be additional financial pressure on state school budgets from having to accommodate extra pupils.

How many pro-Brexit comedians are there?,"Marcus Brigstocke is furious about the decision to leave the EU Comedy and current affairs have always had a close relationship - but Brexit and Donald Trump's presidency have posed new challenges for comics. Politics has long been a part of Marcus Brigstocke's comedy routine. He's used to people not always agreeing with what he says, but this year it's been different. The subject was Brexit and the reaction in some places was unlike anything he'd experienced before. We met in Llandudno at the Craft of Comedy Festival. It's been described as the party conference of comedy - an annual get together to discuss the life and business of people making a living from making other people laugh. I spoke to him at the end of a session on politics and comedy. He explains that, as a result of his jokes, ""a lot of the people I think of as 'my audience' post-Brexit will not be back... they were that angry."" Boris Johnson was one of the key figures of the Vote Leave campaign Brigstocke is furious about the decision to leave the EU. The topic touches him more deeply than almost any other but he has doubts about this political passion. ""Anger's not great for comedy, it's been good for me but you still have to have nuance. You have to find the line and I've struggled with that."" ""People are more upset about this than anything else I have experienced."" Gareth Gwynn is one of Britain's most prolific topical gag writers.  He's worked on Have I Got News For You, the Now Show and the News Quiz on BBC Radio 4. He has a different concern about Brexit. ""Since June 2016 almost every time you walk in to that writers' room and it's tail it's Trump, heads it's Brexit,"" he says. ""It's so big we can't avoid it and the problem is trying to come up with new angles. It's both potentially trying for both the writers and the audience."" Brexit and Donald Trump's presidency have posed new challenges for comics The passions aroused by Brexit are, it appears, challenging for satire. Britain is deeply divided and that poses problems. Josh Buckingham is a commissioner for Channel 4. It is legally obliged to be politically impartial and while it can delight in taking pot shots at politicians it can't do it from just one perspective. He feels some viewers who spend a lot of time watching online content may not be so open to this. ""Audiences expect you to have a view and when they encounter you being even handed they might say, 'pick a side', he explains. Of course many comics have picked a side. The divide? Marcus Brigstocke could only think of two or three comics who might admit to being pro-Brexit - Lee Hurst and Geoff Norcott are notable examples. In a room of more than a hundred writers, producers and performers - we asked if any would come forward and admit to being pro-Brexit. Only one person put their hand up. One or two others approached me quietly afterwards but didn't want to be interviewed. The UK is scheduled to leave the EU on Friday, 29 March 2019 The one person that agreed to speak was James Cary, a writer of sitcoms. He's also an evangelical Christian and used to being in a minority in the comedy world. He's happy to be contrary. ""I think it's because Brexit is associated with conservatism and patriotism and nationalism and these are things comedians like to play against,"" he says. ""I think it's led to a really interesting discussion. I think you've got to be very careful about impugning anyone's motives... England and London are very different places"" He adds: ""We have to be wary of describing one as a metropolitan elite and likewise seeing people in England backward, nationalistic and patriotic and racist.""

Gender pay gap: What every woman should know,"New rules mean thousands of companies are beingforced to come cleanon the state of their gender pay gaps. Some have already volunteered the information - with Schroders fund managers taking the plunge as the first FTSE100 company to go public. The grouprevealed,externalthat fixed pay for its female staff was 33% lower on average than for their male staff, while there was a bonus gap of 66%. It sounds like a bad start for#GenderPayGap, but Schroders said the figures ""may be misleading"". In line with most companies in the financial services sector, there are fewer women in senior roles at the firm. The company said: ""Our analysis of comparable roles shows that we reward men and women fairly for similar work and that the gap reflects the lower representation of women at senior levels within the organisation"". If that's the case, what is the point of these figures? And how should you act on the facts? The Chartered Management Institute (CMI) calls it ""unprecedented transparency"". For the first time, more than 9,000 companies employing about 15m people will have to measure, and then report, how they pay men and women. It will affect nearly half the workforce in the UK. Unequal pay for men and women doing the same job has been illegal for 40 years but overall the gender gap in the UK still stands at 18%. Ann Francke, chief executive of the CMI, says:  ""The answer lies in the fact that the gap, in most cases, is not the result of unequal pay. ""Instead, it reflects the failure to achieve a balance of men and women in senior management roles, or to attract and retain women in some of the better remunerated occupations"". It won't compare your salary with someone else's. You are already entitled to compare your contract to that of another employee of the opposite sex who is doing similar work under theEqual Pay Act,external. What it will show you is: The difference in average earnings between men and women The difference in average bonus payments between men and women The proportion of men and women in each pay quartile Whether a company complies with the regulation and how it compares to other companies Although it is not obligatory, the government is encouraging companies to publish an ""action plan"" alongside their figures, demonstrating the steps they will take to close the gender pay gap within their organisation. Emma Codd, managing partner for talent at Deloitte UK, said: ""For the first time people will be able to see the gender pay gap of large employers at one fixed point in time, with this gap measured and reported in a consistent way. ""They will be able to read about the causes of each company's gap and the actions that are being taken to close it; they will also be able to determine for themselves those companies that are serious about this and those that are not."" Any voluntary, private or public sector company with 250 or more workers has to publish its annual gender pay data from April 2017. Companies must publish the data alongside a written statement on their website, as well as reporting the data to the government. The government plans to publish a link to a portal with all the data on itscampaign page.,external Though there is no set date for each company to report the data, they must do so by April 2018. Any employer that fails to publish its gender pay data would be breaking the law. The Equality and Human Rights Commission has the power to enforce employers to comply with the regulations if they fail to do so. If employees are concerned that their company is not complying or does not have an action plan, they should speak with their HR department. If they or the HR department need further advice, they can check the guidance on the government's website or contact the conciliation service Acas for further help. Some industries are expecting the data to show them up. The industry body for engineering and manufacturing, EEF, says its partners - which include Tata Steel and Rolls-Royce - are bracing themselves. But they say it's not due to a lack of support for women in the industry. ""Far from it,"" EEF's skills policy advisor Verity O'Keefe, said. ""Manufacturers offer enhanced and competitive maternity pay and schemes, flexible working and structured career and training plans."" She said the problem was that ""just a handful"" of engineering apprentices and graduates are female. ""Until we are able to move the dial on female recruitment we are unlikely to see much movement on closing the gender pay gap,"" she added. But not every industry will have the same excuse, and the government hopes the new rules will open up a dialogue between employers and employees about pay gaps, and encourage employers should to use the data to make changes. The Women's Equality Party says women can use the new law to push an action plan or address an unconscious bias within their company. Hannah Peaker, chief of staff at the campaign group, said it would be an ""eye-opener"" for women who, once they see that inequality exists in ""every sector and at every level"", will start to address the issue. Minister for Women and Equalities, Justine Greening, said helping women reach their full potential ""isn't only the right thing to do, it makes good economic sense and is good for British business"". Sam Smethers, chief executive at Fawcett Society, which campaigns for equality, says employers should see this as ""an opportunity not a threat"". She said: ""Through gender pay gap reporting they can address the productivity gap and get the best person for the job at the right level."" If companies don't act, women can use the data to find better opportunities - and vote with their feet. Gender pay gaps must be declared by firms Should the gender pay gap be illegal?

G is not for golf at Xi-Trump summit,"This video can not be played What American and Chinese people want US President Donald Trump will host his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, for two days of talks in Mar-a-Lago, Florida. From trade to currency to North Korea, a lot is on the table for the leaders of the world's two largest economies. Will they have time for some golf? As in alpha males. At a fraught moment in history, the world's two biggest economies are led by two macho men about to meet on a blind date. A could also be for the anxiety this unpredictable encounter provokes among policymakers on both sides, especially in a Chinese presidential team which hates surprises. President Trump has done a lot of rhetorical China bashing. But at this summit the contours of a real US China policy must start to appear. Was all Mr Trump's campaign talk of winning against China just sound and fury signifying nothing or was it a muscular new policy in the making? President Trump has repeatedly accused China of being a master manipulator of its currency. Many economists say it was once but isn't now. For the past two years China has been selling its reserves to keep the value of its currency up rather than driving it down to boost exports. In Florida, will President Trump call President Xi a currency manipulator to his face or will he pick a different battle? Read more: The risks and benefits of China weakening its currency What will this summit actually deliver? Nearly half the US trade deficit is with China and this week President Trump said again the US ""cannot continue to trade if we are going to have an unfair deal like we have right now"". But in his lexicon, D is also for difficult. He has warned that the summit with President Xi will be exactly that, which is perhaps a way of managing expectations down towards Ds for disappointment and deterioration. Some pessimists warn that the most this summit can deliver is greater predictability in a stressed and uncertain relationship. Other pessimists say those pessimists are already too optimistic, that this summit is premature because President Trump doesn't even have a China team let alone a coherent China policy. But those pessimists are in the American camp. For China, US incoherence is a source of optimism. And US employment. President Xi must convince his host that China offers solutions for both if he wants to keep US markets open to Chinese goods. President Trump is giving President Xi plenty of it by inviting him to his private Florida resort. That's meaningful to a status conscious Chinese audience at home. If Mr Trump can refrain from tarnishing the gift by some unforeseen slight or offence, optimists say he may get a calculated concession on North Korea or trade in return. Because President Xi disapproves of a game played back home between tycoons and corrupt Communist Party officials. Instead G is for globalisation of which the Chinese president now likes to see himself the champion. Along with efforts to tackle climate change. Expect subtle Chinese allusions to President Trump's retreat from both. It's supposed to be a gesture of peace and its absence  would send the wrong signal, but President Xi has his own version of this ritual and will not want to submit to the much studied Trump grab and yank. Watch for a hybrid handshake. Ivanka Trump, The soft power weapon of the Trump administration in China. Opinions divide on the father, but the daughter is a source of fascination to many young Chinese, and when relations between the incoming Trump administration and Beijing were at their nadir following the president elect's phone call with the Taiwanese president, it was Ivanka who kept lines of communication open with her attendance at a Chinese new year embassy function in Washington. Read more: Could China's Trump tactics actually be working? Jared Kushner, Ivanka's husband, has also established a good relationship with China's top diplomats in the US. At 36 and with no previous government experience, President Trump's son-in-law has become a key channel of communication between the White House and Beijing. But he's a novice on the most complex bilateral relationship in the world, and until last week his family's real estate business was pursuing a significant investment from a politically connected Chinese company. Those negotiations have now been suspended amid suggestions of a potential conflict of interest, but some observers still worry that he may be vulnerable to China's master negotiators and mistake a short-term gain for long-term US advantage. The leader of North Korea managed to overshadow a visit to Asia last month by the new US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. On that occasion it was the carefully timed announcement of a new rocket engine. No one is in any doubt that North Korea's bid for nuclear missiles which can reach American soil will loom large over this summit. But to prevent the world's inattention even for a moment, Kim Jong-un test fired a missile on the eve of President Xi's arrival in Florida. Read more: North Korea's missile programme And the lower key presence of the first ladies Melania Trump and Peng Liyuan. As fashion model and folk singer respectively, both were familiar with the limelight long before their famous marriages. It will be interesting to watch the first ladies attempt to engage without upstaging the husbands. For all President Xi's fine talk of openness and globalisation, the US market is currently open to Chinese goods and services in a way that China's is not. Beijing has repeatedly promised to remove import barriers, and as this is in the interests of China's long term growth, there really ought to be room for progress here. President Trump will have to avoid shouting, sulking and abuse. Chinese protocol will simply not tolerate it. The slogans that China likes: ""One China"" and ""One Belt, One Road"". The former is the formulation which frames a fragile US-China understanding on how to avoid going to war over Taiwan. The latter is China's massive infrastructure and development initiative for Asia. After initially threatening to re-examine relations with Taiwan, President Trump committed to the ""One China Policy"" in a phone call with President Xi in February. But there is no fixed US position on ""One Belt, One Road"" and President Trump is highly unlikely to sign up to President Xi's other favourite slogan the 'new model of great power relations' by which China signals its hopes for an Asian sphere of influence. The American ghost at the summit feast. The pivot to Asia was the slogan of the first Obama administration eight years ago, a vision of a United States firmly embedded in Asia with the Trans Pacific Partnership trade agreement underpinning a mesh of American security alliances. In Mr Obama's second term, the pivot to Asia was rebranded the rebalance, but with President Trump's decision to walk away from TPP, both pivot and rebalance are history. Even some US security alliances in Asia are looking less than solid in face of the rise of China and its vigorous cheque book diplomacy. If President Trump wants to hang onto allies like the Philippines and Thailand he urgently needs an Asia policy as well as a China policy. In fact, it's hard to define the latter without the former. The Trump administration talks tough on China, but when it comes to actually engaging, it is in the same quandary as every previous US administration since the US and China restored diplomatic relations four decades ago - how to exert leverage on Beijing without damaging itself or its allies. But also for rivalry and risk. In just a few brief hours together over a dinner and a lunch, can the two presidents build enough personal rapport to cut through the strategic rivalry and mistrust which risk the future of the world's most important bilateral relationship? The South China Sea. President Trump does not want to accept China's audacious island-building and militarisation as a fait accompli but President Xi will certainly not back down to a summit threat. And if the new US president is silent on the subject of the South China Sea, some allies may see it as a signal of willingness to surrender control of these vital waters to Beijing. So what to say about the South China Sea? Read more: South China Sea dispute And tariffs and Twitter. And also for Thucydides Trap, the theory that a rising power causes fear in an established power which then escalates toward war. Xi Jinping actually discussed the Thucydides trap at the 2015 summit with Barack Obama. On that occasion, there was no agreement on how to avoid it. Most would agree that the rise of the rising power and the fear of the established power have only increased in the interim. This video can not be played What are the contentious issues around US-China trade? Read more: Is Trump wise to take on China over trade? This week President Trump said the US would solve the problem of a nuclear North Korea on its own if China was unwilling to help. In the first instance, dealing with the problem may mean secondary sanctions on Chinese companies and individuals who trade with North Korea. And as a last resort, it may mean the threat of pre-emptive US military action against Pyongyang. It's a discussion which will get President Xi's full attention but it seems unlikely that he and his host can agree on what constitutes Chinese ""help with North Korea"" let alone how much of it would be enough. US presidents often use summits to remind their Chinese communist counterparts of the virtues of democracy, human rights and freedom. But President Trump may choose to remain silent on values. The new US secretary of state gratified President Xi last month when on a visit to Beijing. He used the Chinese formulation ""non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation"" to describe US-China ties. President Xi would dearly love to hear President Trump echo this language. Despite all the name calling from Mr Trump over the past year, the Chinese president and his state-controlled media have stuck to mild appeals to reason and common interest in framing the US-China narrative. Vanilla is President Xi's favourite flavour here and if he can persuade President Trump to tweet bland he will call it a triumph. At home, the Chinese president is in the sensitive run up to a Communist Party Congress at which he wants to install key allies in top positions. The last thing he needs is a trade war with a vital export market, especially as China's economic growth is slowing. A standoff in the South China Sea or on the Korean peninsula would be even worse. President Xi needs his relationship with President Trump to work. And he needs to go home calling this summit a success. Read more: The ever-growing power of Xi Jinping â¦ hmmmâ¦ not sure. Any suggestions? As in zero sum game. If President Trump takes a zero sum attitude towards the US trade balance with China, and if President Xi takes a zero sum attitude towards the US role in Asia then their summitry will swiftly sour and all talk of winners will look hollow.

Two visions for the future of media,"A multi-billionaire donates $100m to investigative journalism and hacks everywhere ask ""where do I apply?"". Is this what the future of media looks like? I hope not. As modern entrepreneurs go, Pierre Omidyar is among the most innovative and successful. With a net worth,according to Forbes,external, of just over $8bn (Â£6.3bn), the founder of eBay and First Look Media has used his Omidyar Network to plough huge sums into philanthropy. At the Skoll World Forum in Oxford this week, he said his latest pledge would be distributed over three years, with the aim of fighting the ""root causes of the global trust deficit"". Ebay founder Pierre Omidyar donating to fight the ""root causes of the global trust deficit"" He went on: ""A free and independent media is key to providing trusted information and critical checks and balances on those in positions of power"". The first $4.5m (Â£3.6m) will go to the International Consortium of Investigative Journalists (ICIJ), which produced the revelatory Panama Papers in 2016. This is hugely admirable. I wish I had made $8bn, so that I could put one pound in every 80 of my fortune toward uncovering great scoops. And, together with a couple of other developments this week, it shows who is making the running in modern news: Very rich tech industrialists. On Monday, Facebook announced the launch ofthe News Integrity Initiative,external, a $14m project to improve news literacy around the world. This afternoon, Adam Mosseri, Facebook's Vice-President for News Feed, also announced the launch of a new educational tool to help users spot fake news. AndFull Fact,external, the British fact-checking organisation, is re-publishing its top tips for spotting fake news. These will appear in users' news feeds tomorrow and over the weekend. All this follows a raft of measures in recent months to show that the social media giant - and specifically its founder, Mark Zuckerberg - take the spread of misinformation online very seriously. But look more closely at that News Integrity Initiative: It's a collaboration with other international partners, including the Craig Newmark Philanthropic Fund, the Ford Foundation, John S and James L Knight Foundation, and Tow Foundation. That's a lot of charities right there. In other words, the two biggest announcements in the world of media this week - involving the long-term funding of investigative journalism, and the attempt to protect citizens from the ill-effects of fake news - both stem from charity. Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg: joining with other charities to improve news literacy around the world Journalism has always depended on charity.  In fact, it has always relied on the whims, fancies and vanity of rich men (it has tended to be men) in particular, who are prepared to lose huge sums of money in return for political and commercial influence. Sometimes they are prepared to lose huge sums of money because they believe deeply in the intrinsic value of journalism, but this is rare. So, in a sense, the likes of Omidyar and Zuckerberg putting up cash to create a more informed citizenry is nothing new: They're just a digital update of the press barons of the past. Except for the context, that is. Today, the business model for sustaining high-quality journalism has been undermined by the internet, which has turned general news into a widely available commodity. Consequently, there is a real danger that journalism becomes ever more dependent on charity, especially from the very rich. But charity is a poor basis for high-quality journalism, because it cannot be relied upon. The whim of donors might be fragile; and excessive dependence on the favour of individuals can leave you exposed. One virtue of The Guardian's current business model, in which it asks digital readers for donations, is that it will help create a broad base of supporters who can be tapped up regularly. (Whether these contributions can meaningfully contribute to eradicating losses currently in the tens of millions of pounds is a more open question). The news that Omidyar is giving so generously to support journalism is, then, both welcome and a warning. Welcome, because $100m going into scrutiny of the rich and powerful is a great service to democracy. But a warning, because Omidyar knows that his $100m is especially welcome specifically because conventional sources of funding for investigative journalism - that is, paying readers, viewers and listeners - are thought to be in short supply. But are they? In a February blog post, I argued that recent evidence suggests many readers are willing to pay for quality, as shown by the growing circulations of The Spectator, New Statesman, and Private Eye. Fresh evidence arrived this week, in the shape of the Financial Times' annual results. Across digital and print, the pink'unhas a circulation that's nudging 850,000,external. That's up eight per cent year on year. Digital subscriptions - that is, people paying for journalism online, across multiple platforms - accounts for 650,000 of the total: more than three quarters, and up 14 per cent year on year. The FT has three big advantages over some of its rivals. First, it is both a specialist and general publication, because it has financial information that some companies prize. And, of course, one viable future for journalism is specialism: Just think of all those guest publications in the final round of Have I Got News For You. Second, it has a clientele who are generally wealthier than those of, say, most tabloids. And third, a combination of these two factors mean many of their customers can get their companies to pay for those subscriptions. Nevertheless, it has deployed these advantages effectively. You can't argue with the success of Chief Executive John Ridding's strategy of the ""march to a million"" - the aim to get to a million subscribers by 2020. John Ridding, chief executive officer of the Financial Times, is on a ""march to a million"" Years ago, I made - and comprehensively lost - an internal argument at The Independent that that paper (which I was not yet Editor of) should go radically upmarket, and become a kind of white FT that had the confidence to charge. My thinking was that profit is the ultimate and best guarantee of independence; that if you're reliant on advertising alone, your ultimate fidelity is to advertisers rather than readers; and that being paid by your readers has the double advantage of reducing your exposure to the ad market and deepening your relationship with the audience. There's not much I've seen in the past few years to persuade me that's wrong. We know thatThe Economist believes print display advertising will completely disappear,externalin the next few years. Media organisations wholly or solely dependent on advertising will find they are susceptible to the vagaries of an ad market which is anyway being gobbled up by Facebook and Google; and their editorial values under pressure from the need to drive traffic. Of course, you might argue all this is easy for me to say, writing as I am in the offices of a licence-fee funded public broadcaster. That's another model for funding journalism, the long-term viability of which is a subject for another day. For students with ambitions to enter journalism, this week provided two visions of what the future of this trade looks like: Dependence on charity, and dependence on committed customers, also known as viable business. For all that Omidyar's largesse is to be applauded, the latter is a much safer bet. Do technology giants face a backlash? Is the reporter an endangered species? What is the function of an editor?

Is the humble Lada now a classic car?,"This video can not be played The Lada owner who'd turn down a Ferrari The classic car speeds through the English countryside, a lovingly-maintained example of motoring heritage. It rounds a left-hand bend, negotiates a tight right corner, and gracefully dips out of view, a petrol-fuelled gazelle. This is a collectable automobile that has seen its value soar in recent years. Proud owner Ed Hughes is a very happy man. Yet the 45-year-old's set of wheels isn't what most people would imagine when they think of a classic car. It isn't a vintage Ferrari, Lamborghini or Jaguar, for example. Instead, it's a 1994 Lada Riva, the boxy, four-door Russian runabout that regularly features in""worst cars of all time"",externallists. Mr Hughes' example has a 1.5 litre engine, 80,000 miles on the clock, and a top speed of 95mph (153 km/h). And he loves Ladas so much that he owns five of them. Ed Hughes owns a collection of ""Eastern European motoring delicacies"" While some might scoff at the suggestion that a Lada Riva is a classic car, it does in fact meet the generally agreed criteria - it is an old car that is no longer in production, and there is enough interest in the vehicle for it now to be collectable rather than scrapped. And like any classic car worth its salt, there is money to be made, although not Ferrari-style tens of millions. Mr Hughes bought his red Riva 14 years ago for Â£50. It's now worth Â£2,000. As the global classic car industry continues to growstrongly,external, an increasing number of previously unheralded cars are now being avidly collected. But why the Lada Riva? Mr Hughes, who gave up a career in teaching to write full-time for Practical Classics magazine, admits that Ladas were ""deeply unfashionable"" for years. But as his father had owned a few of the Soviet cars when he was growing up, Mr Hughes says ""he'd always liked them"". So in the late 1990s he started buying Ladas, including the Riva, which was available in the UK from 1983 to 1997. When most people think of classic cars, they imagine Ferraris not Ladas ""As happens with old cars, people were throwing them away as their value decreased, and I started rescuing some of the nicer models,"" says Mr Hughes. ""What they lack in fit and finish they make up for in being quite well built mechanically."" Mr Hughes says there are two main reasons for the big rise in the value of Ladas in the UK in recent years. ""Firstly, a new generation of people in their 20s and 30s like the car's shape - there is nothing like it on the road. They've now become a fashion statement."" Dave Richards says it is vital to seek help before buying a classic car Secondly, they are being snapped up to be exported back to Russia and elsewhere in Eastern Europe. Mr Hughes explains: ""There's a small but avid market for Ladas in Eastern Europe, specifically for nice right-hand drive models made for export to Britain. ""Hungarians go berserk for them [in particular] because they think it's utterly amazing they were built for sale to the 'capitalist West' as it were."" In addition to his five Ladas, Mr Hughes' collection of ""Eastern European motoring delicacies"" includes three Wartburgs and a Trabant from former East Germany; a Moskvich from Russia; and a Zaporozhets and a Tavria from Ukraine. He also has ""a half-share"" in a Izh Oda, also from Russia. Mr Hughes says he wouldn't swap his collection for a Ferrari, because he argues that anyone with a ""big enough chequebook"" can pick up an old example of the Italian sports car, while it ""requires a bit more skill, care, and so on, to own a fleet of motoring's less-loved specimens"". Motoring journalist Dave Richards says that the big increase in the number of formerly ""prosaic"" or ordinary cars now considered to be classics certainly isn't limited to former Soviet vehicles. Instead, he says that cars such as old Ford Cortinas and Capris, the original Mini, and even the Austin Maxi, are in big demand. Plus the Citroen 2CV and the original VW Beetle. Older VW Beetles have long been coveted ""Many of these cars are practically extinct now, you hardly ever see them on the road, but there is a real demand for those that are still out there...  this limited supply means that prices are being driven ever upwards,"" says Mr Richards, who is also co-owner of car restoration business Project Shop, based near the Oxfordshire town of Bicester. The company makes a good living restoring classic cars to their former glory. At the UK branch of US car giant Ford, it celebrates its old cars in a quiet corner of its factory in Dagenham, east London. Its Ford Heritage Collection is an Aladdin's Cave of more than 100 Ford cars from the past 80-plus years. The jewel in the crown is a Ford Escort 1850GT, which won the first London-to-Mexico rally in 1970. Ivan Bartholomeusz, who helps to look after the collection, estimates that this car is worth at least Â£500,000. Yet the museum of cars is also home to Ford Fiestas from the 1990s. Ford Capris are now much in demand Mr Bartholomeusz says that the best Ford Cortinas made in the first half of the 1970s can now sell for Â£18,000, but back in the 1980s were worth as little as Â£100. However, Mr Richards cautions that there is still some risk to buying a classic car, be it a Lada, Ford or Ferrari. ""Don't trust your own judgement,"" he says. ""Instead, elicit the help of a car club who might know the vehicle in question, or take someone from that club with you to look at that car. ""This is better than saddling yourself with a car that could cost you a packet."" Of course, owning a classic car isn't just about money; some people do it for the sheer fun. Bronwyn Burrell was 25 when she took part in the same 1970 London-to-Mexico rally as the feted Escort, co-piloting an Austin Maxi. Bronwyn Burrell, pictured here in 1964, took up motorsport in the 1960s After a 47-year hiatus she's now taking the very same Maxi racing again, and is due to take part in the London-to-Lisbon classic car rally later this month. Ms Burrell says: ""It's such good fun, a really exhilarating drive. It's just like I'm 25 again, reliving my youth. ""I wouldn't sell the Maxi unless I had to. As far as I'm concerned she's priceless.""

GB switch will make me better - Francis,"Miguel Francis (centre) ran the seventh fastest 200m in 2016, clocking 19.88 seconds Miguel Francis says he is more likely to fulfil his potential after switching allegiance from Antigua and Barbuda to Great Britain. The 22-year-old, who ran the seventh fastest 200m of 2016, is eligible for Britain as he was born in Montserrat, an Overseas Territory without its own Olympic team. ""I think I'll be less stressed when in a better environment, where people look after you better,"" he told BBC Sport. ""I do think I will perform better."" He can compete for Britain immediately. Francis, who is part of a Jamaica-based training group coached byGlenn Millsand led by 100m and 200m world record holder Usain Bolt, ran a personal best of 19.88 seconds in June. Bolt's record is 19.19, set at the 2009 World Championships. Adam Gemili, 23, competed for Britain in the 200m at Rio 2016 and finished fourth in the final with a time of 20.12. His personal best is 19.97. Francis shares a coach with Usain Bolt - here the two are pictured competing at the 2015 World Championships Francis was due to also compete at last summer's Olympics, but had to withdraw with a hamstring injury suffered in training. He started the process to transfer his allegiance in August - before Rio - but appeared unlikely to see it through after announcing an apparent U-turn in March. Then he toldthe Antigua Observer,externalthat ""things got into my head"" and ""Antigua is who I want to run for"", while admitting the condition of the country's only athletics track was a concern. Now he insists he is more comfortable representing Britain. ""I'm running for who I am supposed to be running for,"" he added. ""Before I moved to Antigua my only option was Britain, but then Antigua wanted me to run for them. I ran for them for my career basically."" Francis' family fled Montserrat for Antigua following a volcanic eruption when he was six months old. His parents have lived in Wolverhampton since 2014 and Francis has visited the area several times.

McLaren's Alonso denies quit claims,"""China here we are!"" Alonso has been out and about meeting fans before this weekend's Chinese Grand Prix Two-time world champion Fernando Alonso has rejected claims he could walk away from McLaren-Honda during this season. Honda's new engine is less powerful and less reliable than last year's and McLaren are struggling towards the back of the field as they go into this weekend's Chinese Grand Prix. But Alonso said: ""I prefer to be here than in a supermarket in my home town."" He said claims from friend and former driver Mark Webber that he could quit mid-season were ""definitely not true"". ""If one ex-driver is interviewed, there is always one question about Alonso, on the situation, how difficult it is,"" the 35-year-old Spaniard said. ""Everyone [acts like they are] close to me and it's like I have a depression, and it's not like that. ""In F1, I am delivering at my best, I am more prepared than ever. I perform at my best."" What next for McLaren-Honda? Alonso expects big change in his team Alonso was on course to earn an unexpected point for 10th place last month in the season-openingAustralian Grand Prixafter what he said was ""one of the best races of my life"". He held off two other cars until damage caused by a broken brake duct forced a late retirement. ""The team is not very competitive now; there's nothing we can do from one day to another,"" he said. ""At the same time, the team is expecting an extra result from me now, as we did in Australia, when the predictions say we are last. ""If in China they say we are last, hopefully Alonso will be in the points."" However, Alonso said it was ""a little bit difficult to understand"" how the engine could have ""done a step backwards this year"". He added: ""We are working very hard for the last couple of months to fight for podiums and victories and if we can't do that we need to change the situation. ""It is what we are asking for. We are here to win and we are not winning so we need to change something."" BBC Sport revealed last month that McLaren hadapproached Mercedesabout the possibility of using their engines in the future. Alonso said: ""I have nothing really to say. I know there is some media speculation about things. I read also the things. But as far as I am concerned there is no news."" Alonso's contract with McLaren runs out this season and there is continuing speculation that he could switch to Mercedes in 2018 to partner Lewis Hamilton, whose team-mate Valtteri Bottas has signed only aone-year deal. Alonso said: ""It is a question for the future. Nothing is ruled out. ""I respect [Hamilton] a lot. We like to compete and beat the best. Same with Michael [Schumacher]. It was fantastic to win titles when Michael was on the track as well, because if not they do not have the same value.""

How do you come back from devastating failure?,"Olympian Lutalo Muhammad was seconds away from winning a taekwondo gold medal at the Rio Olympics when his dreams were shattered. The Victoria Derbyshire programme followed him as he met others who have overcome personal setbacks. ""I'm sorry, I don't want to cry on TV, but I'm so distraught."" These are not the words usually associated with somebody who has won a medal at the Olympic Games. But for Lutalo Muhammad, the Rio 2016 Olympics were about one thing: a gold medal. Anything less was a failure. Shortly before breaking down on television, with moments remaining of his gold medal taekwondo final, Lutalo was about to fulfil his lifelong dream. He was leading 6-4 as the clock counted down. But his opponent hit him with a reverse turning kick with the last kick of the final. He lost, and his dream had slipped through his fingers. ""The initial period was horrible,"" he says now, six months on from winning the silver medal. Lutalo broke into tears after the loss ""I lost at the Olympics in the last second. And one of the hardest things to deal with was that the entire world was watching. ""My lowest point was captured on camera for everybody to see. That was a very difficult thing for me to deal with."" As part of his attempt to come to terms with Olympic disappointment, Lutalo has met other people who have overcome adversity. Paloma Thompson has two healthy, happy boys. Wynter is four and Bodhi is two. Wynter was born three months premature and has some learning difficulties - something for which Paloma blamed herself. Paloma says she did not feel worthy of being Wynter's mother ""I felt like a failure, because when you're pregnant the one job you are meant to do is keep your child safe - protect them for the full nine months,"" she tells Lutalo. ""I just felt like my body let him down, and now he's had to start life in a really difficult place."" Paloma says she believed she was not ""worthy of being his mum"" for the first year of Wynter's life. Eventually, she was diagnosed with a form of post-natal depression and has since been seeing a therapist. She also joined a group for other mothers with similar feelings. Paloma now has a ""wonderful"" relationship with both her children Now, she says, she has an ""absolutely wonderful"" relationship with her children. Overcoming adversity is all about ""looking for the positives"", she tells Lutalo. ""Try not to dwell on what happened, but make the most of now."" One man who has looked past previous setbacks to achieve great success is Lord Sugar. As the star of BBC One's The Apprentice, he is one of the best known businessmen in the country, but his rise to the top was not without difficulties. Ventures into the gaming market in the 1990s with the Amstrad GX4000 and the pen computing market with the PenPad were both commercial flops. Lord Sugar is characteristically blunt in response: ""I had a failure and people talked about my failure, and you have to move on. This video can not be played Lord Sugar on how to bounce back from failure. ""We dropped from the darlings of the computer industry down to virtually zero and that was a very, very tough time,"" he says. ""We went from making profits of Â£160m a year to losses of Â£70m, and big bank debts."" So how do you overcome public failure, Lutalo asks him. ""You can't deal with it by arguing against it or making excuses,"" Lord Sugar says. ""You have to move on until you get your next product in the marketplace, like our satellite dishes which we made for Sky television, and then suddenly everything else was forgotten."" For others, financial difficulties can pervade family life. Naomi Gilmore ran a garden furniture company worth almost Â£1m, until things started suddenly to go wrong. ""I think my lowest point came about six months after my highest point,"" she tells Lutalo. ""I had turned over nearly Â£1m in business. I really thought like I'd made it. I had a team of staff."" But after a summer of bad weather affected sales of her outdoor furniture, her suppliers chose to sell to bigger retailers instead, which forced her to put her business into administration. Naomi lost everything in a period of six months Within six months, bailiffs were knocking at Naomi's door, threatening to take her car away. ""I sat on the kitchen floor and I just felt like my soul had been ripped out. I just felt like a huge failure. ""I felt like I'd let my family down. I didn't even know how I was going to keep a roof over their heads or feed them. ""I just wanted to hide away and pretend it wasn't all happening."" Naomi struggled to find work, and eventually chose to try business once more - writing down on a piece of paper what she was good at, and starting up an online marketing company as a result. She feels her past experiences have taught her to keep a better overview of her current company. ""Now I feel like a success, and I feel I've used that past feeling of failure very much to my advantage."" Lutalo will be hoping, in much the same way, that when it comes to Tokyo 2020 he too can learn from the anguish of Rio to finally put that gold medal around his neck.

How will Poland behave towards the UK in Brexit talks?,"Zachodnia bus station in Warsaw is big, bustling and busy. People laden with 57 varieties of luggage - from smart suitcases to supermarket bags tied together with string - queue in the spring sunshine, passports open, tickets in their hands. Coaches come and go all the time. To St Petersburg, Bosnia, Minsk and Vienna.  And this one - after a gruelling 29-hour journey with many stops - to London. As the driver Lukasz hauls bags into the coach's underbelly, he tells me there used to be 20 people a day going to London, but now there's not a single one going the whole way. ""It's a very strong situation in London for Polish people, difficult,"" he says. Why? It is because of Brexit. BBC News: Brexit Brexit: Article 50 has been triggered - what now? Theresa May 'wants and expects' to protect rights of Poles in UK Poland cries blackmail at EU summit There is a widespread perception Britain is no longer a friendly place. I am told Polish TV and radio has been full of a story about a Polish teenager being attacked. It may not be true, but there have been many such stories here, apparently unreported in Britain. It is at least arguable that one of the main reasons we are leaving the EU is because many people thought there were too many Poles and Eastern Europeans in the UK. Their fate will be the very first thing to be discussed in the Brexit talks. Theresa May has said she ""wants and expects"" to be able to protect the rights of Polish citizens in the UK Kasia, who lives in the UK, tells me: ""Nobody knows what will happen, that's the scariest thing. What will we need to stay? No answers."" The Polish government will be a big player when it comes to the negotiations over the UK's divorce from the EU. European Council president Donald Tusk, incidentally a former Polish prime minister whose reappointment the Polish government tried to block, stresses the need for unity. But individual nations will have individual bees in their respective bonnets. EU leaders embrace multi-speed Europe EU split over pace of reform as crisis bites The Polish government will place a high priority on the rights of its citizens who live in the UK and those who want to come in the future. Students at Warsaw University tell me Britain is still a prime destination. Natalia wants to study in Scotland and helps run an advice service for students. ""We've got thousands of questions,"" she says. ""'What about Brexit?', 'Will we still be able to get a student loan?', 'Will I be able to finish my studies?' And to be honest we can't really answer them. ""My friend is currently studying in the UK and she got an email saying 'We are not sure if you will be able to finish your studies here, but don't worry, we hope it will work out'."" Poland's fiercely nationalistic ruling party Law and Justice (PiS) is very hostile to the powers that be in Brussels and sees the UK as something of an ally, one it will miss. Prime Minister Beata Szydlo accused President Hollande of trying to blackmail Poland, which is the biggest net recipient of EU funds One of the party's MPs, Marcin Horala, tells me his government should demand as little change as possible. ""It would be best to keep all the achievements of the EU as it is: free travel, free work. That you can change your place of living freely within Europe is profitable for all sides, including Britain. ""I would try to convince the British government to have two immigration policies,"" he says. ""One for members of the EU, one for others."" As it happens, at the time I visit Poland, Catherine Barnard, professor of European law at Cambridge, is lecturing at the College of Europe just outside Warsaw. She tells me this would all be very complicated. ""For those who are currently [in the UK], there is a real problem. We have no records of who is in the country,"" she explains. ""For people who have been working for agencies, working in the fields, collecting daffodils in the East of England, [it's] much harder to work out how long they've been here. They may not have any paperwork. It will be quite difficult to prove their right to be in the UK."" And there's more. She adds: ""There will be some sort of work permit scheme in the future. Will it be light touch, or a full visa scheme, as applied now to non-EU nationals? That's extremely burdensome to employers and a lot of small businesses [who have] never been through that process will be in for a quite significant shock."" Pawel Kaczmarczyk, director of the Centre for Migration Research in Warsaw, argues the British government knows the UK needs Polish immigrants, and so - despite claims to be ""taking back control"" - there won't be any real difference. ""All of us know that migration is a lot about perception, not reality. But when we consider this case, it has been a hugely beneficial process, and still politicians and the media are able to present it as a negative story. That is one of the main reasons for Brexit. ""It's quite a paradox: in the end we will see Polish migrants staying in the UK and the UK out of the EU."" Poland will play a critical role in these coming talks and, despite a great feeling of friendship towards the UK, few think Mrs May will get her way.

Francis switches allegiance to Britain,"Miguel Francis (centre) ran the seventh fastest 200m in 2016, clocking 19.88 seconds Miguel Francis says he is more likely to fulfil his potential after switching allegiance from Antigua and Barbuda to Great Britain. The 22-year-old, who ran the seventh fastest 200m of 2016, is eligible for Britain as he was born in Montserrat, an Overseas Territory without its own Olympic team. ""I think I'll be less stressed when in a better environment, where people look after you better,"" he told BBC Sport. ""I do think I will perform better."" He can compete for Britain immediately. Francis, who is part of a Jamaica-based training group coached byGlenn Millsand led by 100m and 200m world record holder Usain Bolt, ran a personal best of 19.88 seconds in June. Bolt's record is 19.19, set at the 2009 World Championships. Adam Gemili, 23, competed for Britain in the 200m at Rio 2016 and finished fourth in the final with a time of 20.12. His personal best is 19.97. Francis shares a coach with Usain Bolt - here the two are pictured competing at the 2015 World Championships Francis was due to also compete at last summer's Olympics, but had to withdraw with a hamstring injury suffered in training. He started the process to transfer his allegiance in August - before Rio - but appeared unlikely to see it through after announcing an apparent U-turn in March. Then he toldthe Antigua Observer,externalthat ""things got into my head"" and ""Antigua is who I want to run for"", while admitting the condition of the country's only athletics track was a concern. Now he insists he is more comfortable representing Britain. ""I'm running for who I am supposed to be running for,"" he added. ""Before I moved to Antigua my only option was Britain, but then Antigua wanted me to run for them. I ran for them for my career basically."" Francis' family fled Montserrat for Antigua following a volcanic eruption when he was six months old. His parents have lived in Wolverhampton since 2014 and Francis has visited the area several times. Zharnel Hughes - born in the British overseas territory of Anguilla - and the United States-born quartet of Tiffany Porter, Cindy Ofili, Shante Little and Montene Speight have all switched allegiance to Britain in recent years.

Chelsea keep cushion but durable Spurs stay in hunt,"This video can not be played Conte revels in 'great' win over world's 'best coach' Chelsea's win over Manchester City and Tottenham's triumph at Swansea meant it was 'as you were' at the top of the Premier League - but the story behind the scorelines was one of pulsating drama. It was a night of fluctuation at either end of the table, with fortunes swinging back and forth as the season enters the finishing straight. Italian Antonio Conte has an image as one of the Premier League's most animated managers, stalking the touchline constantly and even swinging from the dug-out in celebration when Gary Cahill scored a late Chelsea winner at Stoke recently. He was in more subdued mood during and afterthe 2-1 win that gave them the league double over Pep Guardiola's sideand maintained their seven-point advantage over Spurs in second - although he gave his familiar joyous response to all four sides of Stamford Bridge at the final whistle. Eden Hazard's double gave Chelsea all three points at Stamford Bridge Conte admitted: ""My look is tired because I feel like I played it with my players tonight. I suffered with them. But we must be pleased because we beat a strong team - the best team in the league. ""I think they have a great coach - the best in the world. To win this type of game at the end of the season is great."" It restored Chelsea's equilibrium after the surprise home loss to Crystal Palace and brought calm back to a tense Stamford Bridge. But while Conte was able to rest after this crucial win, events elsewhere mean he and his players cannot relax too much, despite that seven-point cushion with only eight games to go. Tottenham were 1-0 down at Swansea with 88 minutes gone - and won 3-1 When Spurs trailed late in the game at Swansea to Wayne Routledge's early goal, while Chelsea led Manchester City, the gap between the top two was a potential 10 points, and the old insults were being prepared for manager Mauricio Pochettino and his players. 'Spursy' is a label that has often been attached to Tottenham's capacity to come up short, never more so than last season when they finished third in what had effectively been a two-horse race to the title with eventual champions Leicester. On the final day, they lost 5-1 at relegated Newcastle, insult added to injury as bitter rivals Arsenal beat Aston Villa to finish second. Were Spurs going to falter again, pushing the door ajar on Saturday by beating Burnley while Chelsea lost to Palace, only to slam it shut in their own face in south Wales? This video can not be played Spurs deserved win after 'crazy finish' - Pochettino They answered those charges with a brilliant finishing surge at the Liberty Stadium -turning a 1-0 deficit into a stunning triumphwith goals from Dele Alli, Son Heung-min and Christian Eriksen. Spurs are no longer 'Spursy', irrespective of where they finish this season. This is a side and a squad laced with quality and depth, and made of stern stuff - this was another crucial win secured without injured top-scorer Harry Kane. Two tough away assignments at Turf Moor and struggling Swansea have yielded six points and the statistics speak to both their ability and their durability. Spurs have a five-point advantage over third-placed Liverpool with a game in hand, and kept alive their outside chance of catching leaders Chelsea Spurs have won 29 points in 2017 - more than any other Premier League club. They have won nine, drawn two and lost one of their 12 league games. They have also won 17 points from losing positions, more than any other side, and under Pochettino have won 53 points from losing positions - more than any other side in that time. Spurs remain outsiders to pip Chelsea but this is a team that will keep Conte and his Blues players just glancing over their shoulder and on their mettle. Pochettino has learned the lesson of last term, when his side ran out of steam. They are looking to last the distance. Liverpool's season has been summed up in the past five days. Impressive in beating in-form neighbours Everton 3-1 in the Merseyside derby on Saturday then slipping up against so-called lesser opposition as they conceded a late equaliser todraw 2-2 with Bournemouth at Anfieldon Wednesday. Until very late in their respective fixtures, Spurs and Liverpool looked like finishing the night level on points - Liverpool's lapse and Spurs' stunning comeback left a very different picture Klopp's side have done the double over Arsenal and Everton, drawn twice with Manchester United, and won and drawn against Manchester City, Chelsea and Spurs. It is a hugely impressive record. Set this against their past six defeats, which all came against teams in the bottom half of the table at kick-off. Liverpool have lost to Burnley, Bournemouth, Swansea, Hull and Leicester this season - even doomed Sunderland held them to a 2-2 draw at the Stadium Of Light. This video can not be played Klopp takes responsibility for late Liverpool lapse The loss of top scorer Sadio Mane to injury is also ominous. Liverpool have won only two points in four Premier League games without the Senegal striker this season. Liverpool remain third but they were victims of their own carelessness and the Spurs' revival at Swansea. If they had held out for another three minutes they would have been only three points behind them - while at one point it looked like results might even have had them level with the second-placed side. Now their position looks markedly more perilous. They are two points ahead of fourth-placed Manchester City, who have a game in hand, and six points ahead of Arsenal and Manchester United, who both have two games in hand. Liverpool have two away games coming up at Stoke and West Bromwich Albion - and Klopp has problems to address. Marco Silva's appointment was questioned when he succeeded Mike Phelan at Hull City in January. Those doubts seemed a long way away as the Portuguese guided them out of the Premier League's bottom three for the first time since October. The4-2 victory over Middlesbroughnot only provided the Tigers with another vital three points after the win over West Ham at the weekend, it also inflicted a heavy blow on a relegation rival, leaving the Teessiders seven points behind Silva's side, albeit with a game in hand. Harry Maguire got the fourth of Hull's goals against relegation rivals Middlesbrough Silva has shown a sure touch at home, with five wins and 16 points out of 18, but also a priceless ability to take misfits and give them back their belief. Oumar Niasse was a laughing stock at Everton, a striker not even given a first-team locker by manager Ronald Koeman and exiled to the under-23s - where, it should be said, his attitude was widely praised - after a miserable time following his Â£13.5m move from Lokomotiv Moscow in February. He did not score a goal for Everton and yet he was on the mark for Hull for the fifth time against Middlesbrough and is displaying glimpses of a quality that were never on show at Goodison Park. Victory over Boro lifted Hull out of the relegation zone for the first time since October And on Wednesday, there was a goal for another on-loan forward, Lazar Markovic, who has been on his travels after struggling at Liverpool following a Â£20m move from Benfica in 2014. The Serb had a loan deal with Sporting Lisbon cancelled this season before arriving at Hull and also had an unfulfilling spell at Fenerbahce last season, but Silva has shown faith. The Portuguese also seems to have built a side with backbone, the Tigers coming from behind twice for the crucial wins against the Hammers and Boro. The 39-year-old is under contract until the end of the season and his reputation is growing by the week. It will be an impressive addition to his CV if he can navigate a route to safety after taking over when his new charges were propping up the Premier League table.

An A-Z of big issues in tense US-China summit,"This video can not be played What American and Chinese people want US President Donald Trump will host his Chinese counterpart, Xi Jinping, for two days of talks in Mar-a-Lago, Florida. From trade to currency to North Korea, a lot is on the table for the leaders of the world's two largest economies. Will they have time for some golf? As in alpha males. At a fraught moment in history, the world's two biggest economies are led by two macho men about to meet on a blind date. A could also be for the anxiety this unpredictable encounter provokes among policymakers on both sides, especially in a Chinese presidential team which hates surprises. President Trump has done a lot of rhetorical China bashing. But at this summit the contours of a real US China policy must start to appear. Was all Mr Trump's campaign talk of winning against China just sound and fury signifying nothing or was it a muscular new policy in the making? President Trump has repeatedly accused China of being a master manipulator of its currency. Many economists say it was once but isn't now. For the past two years China has been selling its reserves to keep the value of its currency up rather than driving it down to boost exports. In Florida, will President Trump call President Xi a currency manipulator to his face or will he pick a different battle? Read more: The risks and benefits of China weakening its currency What will this summit actually deliver? Nearly half the US trade deficit is with China and this week President Trump said again the US ""cannot continue to trade if we are going to have an unfair deal like we have right now"". But in his lexicon, D is also for difficult. He has warned that the summit with President Xi will be exactly that, which is perhaps a way of managing expectations down towards Ds for disappointment and deterioration. Some pessimists warn that the most this summit can deliver is greater predictability in a stressed and uncertain relationship. Other pessimists say those pessimists are already too optimistic, that this summit is premature because President Trump doesn't even have a China team let alone a coherent China policy. But those pessimists are in the American camp. For China, US incoherence is a source of optimism. And US employment. President Xi must convince his host that China offers solutions for both if he wants to keep US markets open to Chinese goods. President Trump is giving President Xi plenty of it by inviting him to his private Florida resort. That's meaningful to a status conscious Chinese audience at home. If Mr Trump can refrain from tarnishing the gift by some unforeseen slight or offence, optimists say he may get a calculated concession on North Korea or trade in return. Because President Xi disapproves of a game played back home between tycoons and corrupt Communist Party officials. Instead G is for globalisation of which the Chinese president now likes to see himself the champion. Along with efforts to tackle climate change. Expect subtle Chinese allusions to President Trump's retreat from both. It's supposed to be a gesture of peace and its absence  would send the wrong signal, but President Xi has his own version of this ritual and will not want to submit to the much studied Trump grab and yank. Watch for a hybrid handshake. Ivanka Trump, The soft power weapon of the Trump administration in China. Opinions divide on the father, but the daughter is a source of fascination to many young Chinese, and when relations between the incoming Trump administration and Beijing were at their nadir following the president elect's phone call with the Taiwanese president, it was Ivanka who kept lines of communication open with her attendance at a Chinese new year embassy function in Washington. Read more: Could China's Trump tactics actually be working? Jared Kushner, Ivanka's husband, has also established a good relationship with China's top diplomats in the US. At 36 and with no previous government experience, President Trump's son-in-law has become a key channel of communication between the White House and Beijing. But he's a novice on the most complex bilateral relationship in the world, and until last week his family's real estate business was pursuing a significant investment from a politically connected Chinese company. Those negotiations have now been suspended amid suggestions of a potential conflict of interest, but some observers still worry that he may be vulnerable to China's master negotiators and mistake a short-term gain for long-term US advantage. The leader of North Korea managed to overshadow a visit to Asia last month by the new US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. On that occasion it was the carefully timed announcement of a new rocket engine. No one is in any doubt that North Korea's bid for nuclear missiles which can reach American soil will loom large over this summit. But to prevent the world's inattention even for a moment, Kim Jong-un test fired a missile on the eve of President Xi's arrival in Florida. Read more: North Korea's missile programme And the lower key presence of the first ladies Melania Trump and Peng Liyuan. As fashion model and folk singer respectively, both were familiar with the limelight long before their famous marriages. It will be interesting to watch the first ladies attempt to engage without upstaging the husbands. For all President Xi's fine talk of openness and globalisation, the US market is currently open to Chinese goods and services in a way that China's is not. Beijing has repeatedly promised to remove import barriers, and as this is in the interests of China's long term growth, there really ought to be room for progress here. President Trump will have to avoid shouting, sulking and abuse. Chinese protocol will simply not tolerate it. The slogans that China likes: ""One China"" and ""One Belt, One Road"". The former is the formulation which frames a fragile US-China understanding on how to avoid going to war over Taiwan. The latter is China's massive infrastructure and development initiative for Asia. After initially threatening to re-examine relations with Taiwan, President Trump committed to the ""One China Policy"" in a phone call with President Xi in February. But there is no fixed US position on ""One Belt, One Road"" and President Trump is highly unlikely to sign up to President Xi's other favourite slogan the 'new model of great power relations' by which China signals its hopes for an Asian sphere of influence. The American ghost at the summit feast. The pivot to Asia was the slogan of the first Obama administration eight years ago, a vision of a United States firmly embedded in Asia with the Trans Pacific Partnership trade agreement underpinning a mesh of American security alliances. In Mr Obama's second term, the pivot to Asia was rebranded the rebalance, but with President Trump's decision to walk away from TPP, both pivot and rebalance are history. Even some US security alliances in Asia are looking less than solid in face of the rise of China and its vigorous cheque book diplomacy. If President Trump wants to hang onto allies like the Philippines and Thailand he urgently needs an Asia policy as well as a China policy. In fact, it's hard to define the latter without the former. The Trump administration talks tough on China, but when it comes to actually engaging, it is in the same quandary as every previous US administration since the US and China restored diplomatic relations four decades ago - how to exert leverage on Beijing without damaging itself or its allies. But also for rivalry and risk. In just a few brief hours together over a dinner and a lunch, can the two presidents build enough personal rapport to cut through the strategic rivalry and mistrust which risk the future of the world's most important bilateral relationship? The South China Sea. President Trump does not want to accept China's audacious island-building and militarisation as a fait accompli but President Xi will certainly not back down to a summit threat. And if the new US president is silent on the subject of the South China Sea, some allies may see it as a signal of willingness to surrender control of these vital waters to Beijing. So what to say about the South China Sea? Read more: South China Sea dispute And tariffs and Twitter. And also for Thucydides Trap, the theory that a rising power causes fear in an established power which then escalates toward war. Xi Jinping actually discussed the Thucydides trap at the 2015 summit with Barack Obama. On that occasion, there was no agreement on how to avoid it. Most would agree that the rise of the rising power and the fear of the established power have only increased in the interim. This video can not be played What are the contentious issues around US-China trade? Read more: Is Trump wise to take on China over trade? This week President Trump said the US would solve the problem of a nuclear North Korea on its own if China was unwilling to help. In the first instance, dealing with the problem may mean secondary sanctions on Chinese companies and individuals who trade with North Korea. And as a last resort, it may mean the threat of pre-emptive US military action against Pyongyang. It's a discussion which will get President Xi's full attention but it seems unlikely that he and his host can agree on what constitutes Chinese ""help with North Korea"" let alone how much of it would be enough. US presidents often use summits to remind their Chinese communist counterparts of the virtues of democracy, human rights and freedom. But President Trump may choose to remain silent on values. The new US secretary of state gratified President Xi last month when on a visit to Beijing. He used the Chinese formulation ""non-conflict, non-confrontation, mutual respect and win-win cooperation"" to describe US-China ties. President Xi would dearly love to hear President Trump echo this language. Despite all the name calling from Mr Trump over the past year, the Chinese president and his state-controlled media have stuck to mild appeals to reason and common interest in framing the US-China narrative. Vanilla is President Xi's favourite flavour here and if he can persuade President Trump to tweet bland he will call it a triumph. At home, the Chinese president is in the sensitive run up to a Communist Party Congress at which he wants to install key allies in top positions. The last thing he needs is a trade war with a vital export market, especially as China's economic growth is slowing. A standoff in the South China Sea or on the Korean peninsula would be even worse. President Xi needs his relationship with President Trump to work. And he needs to go home calling this summit a success. Read more: The ever-growing power of Xi Jinping â¦ hmmmâ¦ not sure. Any suggestions? As in zero sum game. If President Trump takes a zero sum attitude towards the US trade balance with China, and if President Xi takes a zero sum attitude towards the US role in Asia then their summitry will swiftly sour and all talk of winners will look hollow.

Chelsea keep their cushion but durable Tottenham no longer look 'Spursy',"This video can not be played Conte revels in 'great' win over world's 'best coach' Chelsea's win over Manchester City and Tottenham's triumph at Swansea meant it was 'as you were' at the top of the Premier League - but the story behind the scorelines was one of pulsating drama. It was a night of fluctuation at either end of the table, with fortunes swinging back and forth as the season enters the finishing straight. Italian Antonio Conte has an image as one of the Premier League's most animated managers, stalking the touchline constantly and even swinging from the dug-out in celebration when Gary Cahill scored a late Chelsea winner at Stoke recently. He was in more subdued mood during and afterthe 2-1 win that gave them the league double over Pep Guardiola's sideand maintained their seven-point advantage over Spurs in second - although he gave his familiar joyous response to all four sides of Stamford Bridge at the final whistle. Eden Hazard's double gave Chelsea all three points at Stamford Bridge Conte admitted: ""My look is tired because I feel like I played it with my players tonight. I suffered with them. But we must be pleased because we beat a strong team - the best team in the league. ""I think they have a great coach - the best in the world. To win this type of game at the end of the season is great."" It restored Chelsea's equilibrium after the surprise home loss to Crystal Palace and brought calm back to a tense Stamford Bridge. But while Conte was able to rest after this crucial win, events elsewhere mean he and his players cannot relax too much, despite that seven-point cushion with only eight games to go. Tottenham were 1-0 down at Swansea with 88 minutes gone - and won 3-1 When Spurs trailed late in the game at Swansea to Wayne Routledge's early goal, while Chelsea led Manchester City, the gap between the top two was a potential 10 points, and the old insults were being prepared for manager Mauricio Pochettino and his players. 'Spursy' is a label that has often been attached to Tottenham's capacity to come up short, never more so than last season when they finished third in what had effectively been a two-horse race to the title with eventual champions Leicester. On the final day, they lost 5-1 at relegated Newcastle, insult added to injury as bitter rivals Arsenal beat Aston Villa to finish second. Were Spurs going to falter again, pushing the door ajar on Saturday by beating Burnley while Chelsea lost to Palace, only to slam it shut in their own face in south Wales? This video can not be played Spurs deserved win after 'crazy finish' - Pochettino They answered those charges with a brilliant finishing surge at the Liberty Stadium -turning a 1-0 deficit into a stunning triumphwith goals from Dele Alli, Son Heung-min and Christian Eriksen. Spurs are no longer 'Spursy', irrespective of where they finish this season. This is a side and a squad laced with quality and depth, and made of stern stuff - this was another crucial win secured without injured top-scorer Harry Kane. Two tough away assignments at Turf Moor and struggling Swansea have yielded six points and the statistics speak to both their ability and their durability. Spurs have a five-point advantage over third-placed Liverpool with a game in hand, and kept alive their outside chance of catching leaders Chelsea Spurs have won 29 points in 2017 - more than any other Premier League club. They have won nine, drawn two and lost one of their 12 league games. They have also won 17 points from losing positions, more than any other side, and under Pochettino have won 53 points from losing positions - more than any other side in that time. Spurs remain outsiders to pip Chelsea but this is a team that will keep Conte and his Blues players just glancing over their shoulder and on their mettle. Pochettino has learned the lesson of last term, when his side ran out of steam. They are looking to last the distance. Liverpool's season has been summed up in the past five days. Impressive in beating in-form neighbours Everton 3-1 in the Merseyside derby on Saturday then slipping up against so-called lesser opposition as they conceded a late equaliser todraw 2-2 with Bournemouth at Anfieldon Wednesday. Until very late in their respective fixtures, Spurs and Liverpool looked like finishing the night level on points - Liverpool's lapse and Spurs' stunning comeback left a very different picture Klopp's side have done the double over Arsenal and Everton, drawn twice with Manchester United, and won and drawn against Manchester City, Chelsea and Spurs. It is a hugely impressive record. Set this against their past six defeats, which all came against teams in the bottom half of the table at kick-off. Liverpool have lost to Burnley, Bournemouth, Swansea, Hull and Leicester this season - even doomed Sunderland held them to a 2-2 draw at the Stadium Of Light. This video can not be played Klopp takes responsibility for late Liverpool lapse The loss of top scorer Sadio Mane to injury is also ominous. Liverpool have won only two points in four Premier League games without the Senegal striker this season. Liverpool remain third but they were victims of their own carelessness and the Spurs' revival at Swansea. If they had held out for another three minutes they would have been only three points behind them - while at one point it looked like results might even have had them level with the second-placed side. Now their position looks markedly more perilous. They are two points ahead of fourth-placed Manchester City, who have a game in hand, and six points ahead of Arsenal and Manchester United, who both have two games in hand. Liverpool have two away games coming up at Stoke and West Bromwich Albion - and Klopp has problems to address. Marco Silva's appointment was questioned when he succeeded Mike Phelan at Hull City in January. Those doubts seemed a long way away as the Portuguese guided them out of the Premier League's bottom three for the first time since October. The4-2 victory over Middlesbroughnot only provided the Tigers with another vital three points after the win over West Ham at the weekend, it also inflicted a heavy blow on a relegation rival, leaving the Teessiders seven points behind Silva's side, albeit with a game in hand. Harry Maguire got the fourth of Hull's goals against relegation rivals Middlesbrough Silva has shown a sure touch at home, with five wins and 16 points out of 18, but also a priceless ability to take misfits and give them back their belief.

The cost of Trump's 'Winter White House',"Hello Florida: Mr Trump has flown to Mar-a-Lago most weekends of his presidency When President Trump flies in to Palm Beach County, Jorge Gonzalez stays firmly on the ground. That's a problem for the 35-year-old because his small business, Skywords Advertising, only really works in the air, and when the president pays a visit he brings a 10-mile no-fly zone with him. ""Every weekend he's here we have to shut down,"" said Mr Gonzalez, who employs three other pilots. ""And right now that's every weekend."" Since taking office 10 weeks ago, Mr Trump has spent seven weekends at Mar-a-Lago, a sun-kissed coastal expanse in Palm Beach that he bought in 1985 and turned into a private members club. His visits have riled taxpayers and raised concerns over an uneasy mix of business and politics. On Thursday he will once again jet down to the so-called ""Winter White House"", this time to host the Chinese president Xi Jinping. Roads will close, Secret Service agents will swarm, Navy gunboats will patrol, and Mr Gonzalez will kick his heels. ""About 97% of my business occurs on the weekends, and I make 80% of my revenue between January and May,"" he said. ""We were told to expect him to come once a month. We never imagined it would be every weekend."" Mr Gonzalez estimated that he'd lost about $65,000 and several clients since Mr Trump took office. ""At this rate we might survive through the summer,"" he said, ""but I don't see the company lasting much beyond that."" There are no official expenses yet for Trump's weekend trips - the Government Accountability Office (GAO) has just announced it will begin a review - but travel and security are estimated to cost the taxpayer somewhere in the region of $3.3m per trip, based on a GAO assessment of a similar trip by Barack Obama. Mr Trump has at his disposal the traditional presidential retreat of Camp David, in Maryland, where for decades presidents have hosted foreign leaders. Camp David is a short helicopter trip from the White House and, as an existing Naval base, security comes cheap. But the retreat was apparently not to Mr Trump's taste. ""Camp David is very rustic, it's nice, you'd like it,"" he told a reporter. ""You know how long you'd like it? For about 30 minutes."" This video can not be played Inside Mar-a-Lago So the new president has repaired to Florida most weekends, racking up an estimated bill of about $23 million over 10 weeks. Added to that, the decision to keep his wife Melania and son Barron living in Manhattan is costing the state an estimated $58 million per year, according to the New York Police Department. As a private citizen, Mr Trump delighted in tweeting pot shots at Mr Obama over his presidential travel costs, but according to an analysis by the conservative watchdog Judicial Watch, Mr Obama spent $97 million on travel in his entire eight years in office - a figure Mr Trump could, at his current rate, comfortably outspend within his first year. And Mr Gonzalez isn't the the only one feeling the pinch in Palm Beach. When the president flies in for the weekend it costs the county sheriff's office and city police about $85,000 a day in overtime pay. And other small businesses, from skydiving outfits to local restaurants, say they are losing thousands of dollars. ""This is having a big impact on our budget,"" said Paulette Burdick, the Palm Beach County mayor. ""We fully understand the need to protect the president but it's unfair to ask local taxpayers to pay. And there are a lot of people down here who feel that way."" Inside Donald Trump's Palm Beach retreat Who is the new first family of the US? Is Trump now part of the establishment? The county is looking at savings in its current budget, Mayor Burdick said, with possible cutbacks to parks, building maintenance and homeless services to fund the overtime pay. Mayor Burdick has written twice to the Trump administration asking to be reimbursed for the costs. ""To date, we haven't heard a word back,"" she said. ""I have a long list of things I'd like to say to President Trump,"" she added, ""regarding this, I'd just like to ask him to reimburse us our money."" White House press secretary Sean Spicer has defended the trips, saying the president uses them for vital work. He said on Monday that Mr Trump would not compensate Palm Beach County, arguing that the president had already made a ""sizable donation"" to the federal government by foregoing his $400,000 salary. Then there is the ethical muddle. Mar-a-Lago is a minefield on the scrambled map of Mr Trump's conflicts of interest - a private club of nearly 500 members where the president hosts foreign dignitaries and mingles with executives, billionaire traders, and real estate developers, all of whom have paid $200,000 up front to the Trump Organization to get in the door. The sign-on fee doubled from $100,000 shortly after Mr Trump took office, when proximity to the president of the United States was added to the list of amenities, alongside the tennis courts and spa. ""It's pay-to-play, people are paying for access to the president,"" said Richard Painter, former chief White House ethics lawyer under George W Bush. ""And now he's going down there nearly every weekend, at great expense to the taxpayer, making money by selling off memberships, and members clearly have an opportunity to mingle with White House staff and maybe the president himself."" Exactly who those members are, we can't know. Unlike the White House, Mar-a-Lago has no official visitors' register. In a state that voted for Trump in November, Palm Beach County went for Hillary Clinton, and the disruption now swirling around Mar-a-Lago most weekends might not help win over locals. Mr Gonzalez and others tried to work with the Secret Service to keep their doors open but the response was short and unhelpful, he said. ""A lot of local businesses are suffering, a lot of guys' livelihoods are at stake. It took me 10 years to build this business from scratch. I can't up sticks and do that again."" Correction: An earlier version of this article stated that daily overtime pay for county and city police officers was $120,000. The correct amount is $85,000.
