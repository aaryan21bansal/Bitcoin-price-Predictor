EA removes Russian teams from Fifa 22 game,"The move follows bans from footballing governing bodies Games publisher Electronic Arts will remove the Russian national team and all other Russian teams from Fifa 22 and associated games, it has announced. It was doing so to ""stand in solidarity with the Ukrainian people"",the company tweeted.,external It comes as football's governing bodies Fifa and Uefa said Russia's national side and clubs would be banned from all competitions. Ukraine has asked the video games industry to do more. LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine? RUSSIA:Watching the war on TV UKRAINE:'I have never felt so much love for my homeland' IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict The country's Deputy Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorovcalled on,externalall game-development companies and esport platforms to block Russian and Belarusian accounts, cancel tournaments and ban players Electronic Arts tweeted: ""EA Sports stands in solidarity with the Ukrainian people and like so many voices across the world of football, calls for peace and an end to the invasion of Ukraine. ""In line with our partners at Fifa [the International Federation of Association Football] and Uefa [the Union of European Football Associations], EA Sports has initiated processes to remove the Russian national team and all Russian clubs from EA Sports Fifa products including Fifa 22, Fifa Mobile and Fifa online. ""We're also actively evaluating related changes to other areas of our games."" It has also removed Russian and Belarusian teams from NHL 22 games. There has not been any response yet from Microsoft and Sony, which own Xbox and Playstation respectively, to Mr Fedorov's tweet asking them to leave the Russian market. Music streaming app Spotify has announced it has closed its Russian office indefinitely Earlier this week it removed all content from state media RT and Sputnik on its platform in the European Union, the US and other markets except Russia, following similar steps from Meta and Twitter. Who you play as is an essential element of Fifa, as people live out their sporting dreams from home. Being suddenly unable to choose to play as your country or your favourite club will fundamentally alter the experience that many Russian gamers can have with a game they love. A game they've already paid for. Electronic Arts has also made a similar move with its NHL ice hockey franchise. Given that gigs, movie releases and sporting events have already been cancelled in Russia, it was only a matter of time before the gaming industry got involved. We've already seen games companies fundraising, esports events banning Russian teams and messages of solidarity with the people of Ukraine on social media - but this is the first step that will impact millions of gamers in one go. Whether it goes far enough for Ukraine's deputy prime minister, who called on the gaming industry to take action on Wednesday, we wait and see - but expect this to be the first move from gaming's major players, with more measures likely in the days to come.

Journalist wins 'kleptocrat' book libel case,"Mr Burgis said he was delighted the court action had failed A libel claim brought by a post-Soviet mining giant against a journalist's book about dirty money and corruption has been dismissed by a High Court. Tom Burgis faced potentially huge damages over his book, Kleptopia. But judge Mr Justice Nicklin stopped the case after finding the claim against the author to be wholly flawed. Mr Burgis' publisher said the case had been an attempt to use legal and financial firepower to silence public interest journalism. In the book, Mr Burgis - a Financial Times journalist - charts how he says dirty money is linked to corruption and is now ""flooding the global economy, emboldening dictators [and] poisoning democracies"". Among its stories, the book features Kazakhstan-based Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC), a mining company with interests around the world. Lawyers for ENRC claimed in court that Mr Burgis has defamed the corporation because the real meaning of part of his book was that the company had three men murdered to protect its business interests. Andrew Caldecott QC, for Mr Burgis and HarperCollins publishers, told the court: ""This is not a Private Eye nudge-nudge book. ""It is not a book that pulls its punches at all. The theme is about thieves and their money - masters and their secrecy  - and it shows how the thieves are uniting and the terrible human cost."" In a ruling stopping the case, Mr Justice Nicklin said he had read the book for himself before considering the case papers, so he could form a view like any other ordinary reader. He said that ENRC's claim was not sustainable because every reader would know that only individuals can commit murder, rather than corporations. That early ruling meant the case could not proceed to a full libel trial - and the judge awarded Â£50,000 in costs against ENRC, while also refusing it permission to appeal. Speaking outside court, Mr Burgis said: ""I wrote a book about what I believe is the greatest threat to freedom today: the rise of kleptocracy. I'm delighted that this attempt to censor Kleptopia has failed."" He however still faces a second libel action over an article published in the Financial Times relating to his investigation. A spokesman for HarperCollins described the case as ""lawfare"" - legal action that poses such massive financial risks to a defendant it has the effect of silencing them or making them withdraw. ""HarperCollins is committed to publishing high quality investigative non-fiction and to defending our authors in the face of legal attacks from those who would seek to use the UK courts to silence them. ""It is grossly unfair that yet again HarperCollins and our author have had to risk substantial legal costs and personal liability defending public interest journalism."" But a spokesman for ENRC said the case had been fairly brought and insisted there had been enormous damage to its reputation because of the book. ""The independence of the British judiciary remains the UK's greatest defence of our democracy and our shared liberal values,"" said the spokesman. ""It is regretful to have witnessed a growing attempt to mischaracterise our reasonable and proportionate steps to defend our reputation through the courts. ""We have maintained throughout that we fully support the media's right to report fairly and objectively on matters, including on our own business.""

Kim Kardashian declared single in divorce with Ye,"The couple have four children together Kim Kardashian is a single woman once again after nearly eight years married to Ye, formerly known as Kanye West. In a virtual court hearing on Wednesday, the reality star also officially and legally dropped ""West"" from her last name. Kardashian, who filed for divorce from the rapper last year, made the request in December to become legally single. The former couple must still resolve the division of property and custody of their four children. Wednesday's ruling - granting Kardashian's request for a ""bifurcated divorce"" - means that divorce proceedings will be split into two parts - the first settling her legal name and marital status, now resolved, and the second part involving custody and financial assets. In several sworn statements submitted since December, the 41-year-old beauty and television mogul said she ""very much"" desired the termination of her marriage. ""I believe that the court terminating our marital status will help Kanye to accept that our marital relationship is over,"" she wrote in a statement last month. Ye, 44, who was not present for the hearing, had publicly fought the separation and appealed for Kardashian to return to their marriage. But Kardashian also wrote that his recent social media activity, in which he posted private text messages and attacked her new boyfriend, comedian Pete Davidson, had caused ""emotional distress"". On Wednesday, the rapper posted a video for his new song Eazy, apparently showing an animated version of Davidson being kidnapped and buried. At the divorce hearing, a lawyer for Ye pushed for an agreement from Kardashian to waive any marital privilege she might have with a subsequent spouse. Kardashian and her lawyer called the move ""unprecedented"" and it was denied by the judge. The former couple began dating in 2012 and married two years later. Ye is one of the biggest names in rap music, known for global hits like Stronger, Jesus Walks and Gold Digger. He has also found success as a fashion designer. Kardashian first found fame in 2007 as the star of reality TV show about her family, Keeping Up With The Kardashians, and has since launched fashion and beauty brands.

Oil price rises again as buyers shun Russian fuel,"Russian oil makes up around 8% of global supply The cost of oil surged on Wednesday, as traders snapped up non-Russian oil, increasing the chance of further price rises at UK forecourts. Brent crude - the global benchmark for oil prices - passed $113 a barrel, its highest level since June 2014. Traders are struggling to sell Russian oil, even at a discount, because of the new difficulties in shipping and payments amid its invasion of Ukraine. Gas prices also doubled, which could feed through to energy bills. Almost 70% of Russian crude oil exports do not have a buyer according to UK-based research consultancy, Energy Aspects. On Tuesday, oil trader Trafigura offered a cargo load of Russian crude oil at a record discount of $18.60 per barrel below the market rate for Brent, but could not find a buyer willing to take the risk. Amrita Sen, its founding partner told the BBC World Service that buyers are concerned that they could run afoul of Western sanctions and ""lawyers are poring through the language"" of the new rules. The RAC said if the higher oil price is sustained, the cost of filling up a car in the UK will increase with it. ""The sudden $10 jump in the oil price is likely to take the average price of petrol towards 155p a litre and diesel to 160p, particularly as it's looking like this price isn't just a market blip caused by the US and allies deciding to dip into the strategic oil reserve. ""If oil does stay at this level, the journey to an average unleaded price of 155p may be far too quick."" said RAC fuel spokesperson Simon Williams. The average price of petrol across UK forecourts on Tuesday was 151.6p per litre, according to the RAC. Household gas and electricity bills are set to rise after the annual energy price cap increases to Â£1,971 in April, but the rise in wholesale prices amid the war in Ukraine may mean the price cap ratchets up to Â£3,000 by the end of the year, according to one energy analyst. ""Wholesale prices make up between 40-50% of household bills,"" said independent energy analyst David Cox. ""If these high prices stay around 400p per therm we may see the price cap head closer to Â£3,000 per year, which is terrifying."" Energy analysts at Cornwall Insights also predicted a jump in the energy price cap in October, based on turmoil in the European wholesale gas prices, to over Â£2,900. Higher oil and commodity prices helped the London stock market to buck the downward trend in global markets, with commodity-linked company share prices surging as the Ukraine crisis fanned fears about supply shortages. The FTSE 100 closed up 1.36%, boosted by Shell and BP shares. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones, Nasdaq and S&P 500 indexes all opened trading higher, and were up between 1.6% and 1.9% respectively at the close of trade. Meanwhile, the price of US oil - West Texas Intermediate crude - rose to almost $109.78 a barrel. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Major movie studios halt Russia film releases Ukraine to sell 'war bonds' to fund armed forces Jaguar Land Rover pauses car sales to Russia Oil and gas is still flowing from Russia - but there's deep concern that situation may change - either because of a further tightening of sanctions, or because Russia itself decides to restrict supplies. So prices are rising. The decision by International Energy Agency members to release 60m barrels of emergency oil reserves has done little to calm the situation. If anything, comments by the head of the agency that global energy security is under threat have made traders even more nervous. Meanwhile wholesale gas prices in the UK and Europe have moved perilously close to the record levels seen in December. Europe gets 40% of its gas from Russia and there are deep concerns about what would happen if those supplies were choked off. At the moment, the high prices are working in Russia's favour - it's making billions at a time when it's economy is being squeezed. While that makes it unlikely Moscow will cut supplies, nothing can be ruled out. If European nations were to clamp down on oil or gas imports, meanwhile, the impact of its sanctions would be magnified dramatically. But it would also cause serious economic pain for those countries themselves. The IEA member countries, led by the United States, yesterday agreed to release 60 million barrels of emergency stockpiles, but it appeared to have had a limited effect on pricing. Selling the emergency oil reserves is not sufficient to meet the supply shortfall caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine or prevent prices from going higher, analysts at Goldman Sachs said. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said the move would not ""make any sustained difference"" to prices. ""Russia controls a sixth of the world's gas and a tenth of its oil. Those figures dwarf the 60 million barrels and industrial buyers, or financial speculators, will be focusing on those numbers and where that supply goes. ""The West is still buying Russian supply and Russia is still providing it but that could conceivably change as relations deteriorate further,"" Mr Mould added. Russian oil exports account for about 8% of global supply. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and allies, a group known as known as OPEC+, met and agreed on Wednesday to stick to their ongoing policy of increasing supply by 400,000 barrels per day in April. ExxonMobil on Tuesday said it would sell out its stakes in Russian oil and gas operations as a result of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Shell and BP have also made similar announcements.

Abramovich says he will sell Chelsea,"Chelsea have been owned by Roman Abramovich since 2003 Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich says he is planning to sell the club. In a statement on the Premier League club's website, businessman Abramovich said he had made the ""incredibly difficult decision"" which ""pains"" him. The Russian will not ask ""for any loans to be repaid"" and said proceeds of the sale would be donated to war victims. Abramovich had said on Saturday he would give""stewardship and care""of Chelsea to its foundation trustees following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. That led to speculation Abramovich - who has loaned the club more than Â£1.5bn - would put Chelsea up for sale, and billionaire Hansjorg Wyss told Swiss newspaperBlick,externalon Wednesday that he had been offered the chance to buy the club. Wyss said Abramovich wanted ""to get rid of Chelsea quickly"" after the threat of sanctions was raised in Parliament. Abramovich, 55, is alleged to have strong ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, which he has denied. He said ""all net proceeds from the sale"" would be donated to the ""victims of the war in Ukraine"". BBC Sport understands Abramovich has already received offers for Chelsea and that he values the club at as much as Â£3bn. In his statement, Abramovich said: ""I have always taken decisions with the club's best interest at heart. ""In the current situation, I have therefore taken the decision to sell the club, as I believe this is in the best interest of the club, the fans, the employees, as well as the club's sponsors and partners. ""The sale of the club will not be fast-tracked but will follow due process. I will not be asking for any loans to be repaid. ""I have instructed my team to set up a charitable foundation where all net proceeds from the sale will be donated. The foundation will be for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine."" BBC Sport understands the trustees of Chelsea's charitable foundation, who had not yet agreed to take control of the club, will no longer be asked to. Abramovich was criticised for not referencing Russia's invasion of Ukraine in that original statement on Saturday. Chelsea's players were not told ahead of time about their owner's new statement, which was released less than a hour before the side's FA Cup fifth-round tie at Luton Town. After falling behind early on, thePremier League team won 3-2to reach the quarter-finals. Abramovich bought Chelsea in 2003 for Â£140m, and in his statement said it had ""never been about business nor money, but about pure passion for the game and club"". This video can not be played Roman Abramovich: Alan Shearer & Micah Richards react to news of Chelsea sale Since his purchase of the club, Chelsea have been transformed, setting the template for how much finance was needed to compete at the top end of the Premier League. In total, Abramovich has loaned the club more than Â£1.5bn, which has helped to bring great success. Under his ownership, the club have won every major trophy possible - including the Champions League twice, both the Premier League and FA Cup five times, the Europa League twice and the League Cup three times. In August 2021, they won the Uefa Super Cup and in February won their first Club World Cup. He has appointed 13 different managers and the club spent more than Â£2bn in the transfer market under his ownership. Chelsea's women's team, who became affiliated to Chelsea FC in 2004, have thrived under Abramovich's ownership, winning the Women's Super League four times, the Women's FA Cup, three times and reaching the Champions League final last season. Their high profile has seen world stars such as Australia's Sam Kerr and Danish forward Pernille Harder move to the club. This video can not be played 'It's his choice, it's his club' - Tuchel on Abramovich's Chelsea sale Other Russian billionaires have already been the subject of European Union sanctions where their assets have been frozen. That has included Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov, who has commercial links to Everton. The United Kingdom government is yet to sanction Abramovich or Usmanov, but Labour MP Chris Bryant said in Parliament on Tuesday that Abramovich was ""terrified of being sanctioned which is why he is going to sell his home tomorrow [Wednesday], and another flat as well"". On Wednesday, during Prime Minister's Questions, Labour leader Keir Starmer asked why Abramovichwas not facing sanctions,with Boris Johnson replying it was ""not appropriate to comment on any individual cases at this stage"". A spokesperson denied the Labour leader's claims and said Abramovich had not done anything sanctionable. Wyss also said: ""Abramovich is trying to sell all of his villas in England, he also wants to get rid of Chelsea quickly. ""I and three other people received an offer on Tuesday to buy Chelsea from Abramovich."" A spokesperson for Abramovich declined to comment on those claims. Dan Roan, BBC sport editor While this was not an entirely unexpected development after it became apparent during the last 24 hours that Roman Abramovich was looking to sell Chelsea, this dramatic announcement still feels like a seismic moment. Not only for the west London club, but for the wider English game too. The Russian billionaire's arrival almost two decades ago helped transform the Premier League's competitive balance, profile and spending power, reinforcing its status as a truly global competition. The oligarch's riches turned Chelsea into a major force in the game, and his ownership seemed to pave the way for subsequent takeovers by overseas billionaires, at clubs like Manchester City for instance. But there was significant controversy too. With Abramovich - one of Russia's richest people - almost never commenting in public, he also came to symbolise the detachment of some super-wealthy club owners. Many also found the ruthlessness with which he treated managers questionable. There was always intrigue surrounding the motives for his ownership, and how he made his fortune. While he has always denied direct links with Putin, the invasion of Ukraine led to calls in parliament for the government to sanction wealthy Russians. Abramovich vehemently denies that he had done anything to merit sanctions being imposed against him. But as the highest-profile oligarch in the country, and withone MP citing concerns about alleged links to corruption,his ownership was coming under mounting scrutiny. And with the government facing mounting pressure to seize his assets, and Abramovich criticised over his failure to explicitly condemn Russia's invasion, it is little surprise that he has swiftly announced his decision to sell. In recent years Abramovich has been an increasingly infrequent visitor to Stamford Bridge, withdrawing his application for a visa in 2018 after relations between the UK and Russia worsened. But while fans had got used to not seeing Abramovich, the Russian's departure could mean the club is run very differently in future - and perhaps with much more financial constraint - by whoever now buys it. That may help explain why some at Chelsea will no doubt be sorry to see him go. Many other observers, however, will be pleased, some of whom have always viewed Abramovich's ownership as a classic example of 'sportswashing'. Having always insisted he was passionate about the club and had its interests at heart, he leaves as one of the most significant, controversial and influential figures in the history of English football. This video can not be played Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel voices frustration over Roman Abramovich questions Football finance expert Kieran Maguire Chelsea will be a desirable football club for many given its status within the game. It's in London which makes it very attractive to ultra high net-worth individuals. You have to caution that Chelsea has lost more money than any other club in the history of the Premier League and its stadium is a lot smaller than some of the other stadiums in London. Speaking to some agents already today, I think the initial asking price is around Â£3bn. I think that is unlikely to be achieved. But if you are looking for a trophy asset - something to show off to your compatriots, to your friends, then Chelsea has an awful lot of attraction. They are European and world champions - that does add to its allure. There are three potential types of bidders we could see. We could see the individual billionaire looking to add to their portfolio of well-known assets. It could come for a private equity company based in the US who believes the riches of Premier League are undervalued in traditional markets. We could see from a sovereign wealth fund as we've seen in relation to Manchester City, Newcastle and Paris St-Germain This sale has come at a bad time in terms of the market. The share price of Manchester United - a good peer group company for Chelsea - is now trading significantly below its initial listing price in 2012. The market seems to have lost its love-in with football and this could impact on the ultimate price Chelsea is sold for. 24 February:Russian President Vladimir Putin launches a military invasion of Ukraine. 25 February:Labour's Chris Bryant tells MPs the UK government should removeRoman Abramovich's ownership of Chelseaand seize his assets, citing concerns about alleged links to corruption. 26 February:Abramovich announces he is handing""stewardship and care""of Chelsea to its charitable foundation. 27 February:Foundation membersexpress concernover whether Charity Commission rules would allow them to run the club.

UK rejects Russian demand to sell satellite share,"Mr Rogozinâs comments followed the Soyuz rocketâs early morning transfer to the launch pad The UK has rejected Russian demands for it to sell its share in internet firm OneWeb to allow a satellite launch. A Soyuz rocket carrying 36 OneWeb satellites is on the launch pad at Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Russia's space agency Roscomos demanded guarantees the spacecraft would not be used for military purposes. It then said it would not launch the rocket unless the UK sold its share in OneWeb - but business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng rejected this. ""There's no negotiation on OneWeb: the UK government is not selling its share,""tweeted Mr Kwarteng,external. Stop rocket launch from Russian site, UK urged What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? UK space start-up gets $500m cash injection The UK government, which hascome under pressure to pull the launchbecause of the war in Ukraine in any case, said it was continuing to discuss the situation with its partners on the OneWeb board. OneWeb itself has made few public comments in recent days, although the BBC understands this was because it wanted the space to remove its personnel from the Baikonur launch complex. This it has now done. UK taxpayers helped buy OneWeb out of bankruptcy in 2020 with a Â£400m stake. In an interview with Russia 24 TV channel, Roscosmos head Dmitry Rogozin said the agency had contacted OneWeb and its partner Arianespace to demand ""comprehensive legally binding guarantees"" that the satellites would not be used for military purposes. ""If by 21:30 on March 4 we do not receive confirmation, the rocket will be removed from the launch pad and the satellites will be sent to the assembly and test building,"" he added. The launch is currently timed for 22:41 GMT on Friday (03:41 local, Saturday). Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Mr Rogozin posted a video of pad workers covering over UK, US and Japanese flags According to Russian news agency TASS, Mr Rogozin said the OneWeb contract had been paid in full and the funds would not be returned. ""We received all the money for it for the manufacture of launch vehicles, upper-stages and for the necessary launch services. ""This money, due to force majeure circumstances that have arisen as a result of the aggressive policy of the West and the sanctions that are applied against Russia, this money will remain in Russia,"" the Roscosmos boss stated. The space agency's twitter feed later went a step further, demanding the ""hostile"" UK government withdraw its shareholding from the London-headquartered company. Mr Rogozin posted a video showing pad workers at Baikonur covering over the flags of the UK, US and Japan from the fairing of Friday's rocket. Neither OneWeb nor the UK government will be taking direction from Mr Rogozin. His demands are impossible. The UK and US militaries want to use OneWeb, and ever since British taxpayers took a share in the company post-bankruptcy the talk has been about adding further defence and security capabilities to future OneWeb satellites. Low-Earth orbiting broadband internet constellations present an emerging challenge for authoritarian regimes. While they can simply turn off terrestrial networks to control the flow of information, this is much harder to achieve with space infrastructure. The numbers of satellites in these new constellations, and the speed at which they move across the sky, make them hard to jam. US entrepreneur Elon Musk this weekshipped antenna terminals to Ukraineto allow citizens there to use his Starlink broadband system. At the moment, most of Ukraine would not be able to plug into OneWeb because much of the country is too far south for its signals. Future launches planned by OneWeb would ultimately though have filled in this gap. Former UK government adviser Dominic Cummings, widely regarded as the official who persuaded Prime Minister Boris Johnson to buy into OneWeb,tweeted at the weekend,externalthat a situation such as that in Ukraine was in their minds when making the investment. OneWeb has just a handful of launches left to complete its network of 648 satellites. All of the missions are booked on Russian Soyuz vehicles that are scheduled to fly out of Baikonur in the coming months. With the existing spacecraft it has in orbit (428), the company can deliver broadband internet connections to locations above 50 degrees North, which includes business customers such as BT in the UK, but it needs those additional satellites if it wants to run a truly global service. Regions important to the company's prospects, including the rest of Europe, most of the US, Africa and Asia, will be left out without the final set of launches. What happens next is anyone's guess, but a flight to orbit on Friday now seems highly unlikely. OneWeb's launch contract is with France-based Arianespace. It markets Soyuz vehicles to the world. Following itsemergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2020, OneWeb paid Arianespace upfront to organise all its launches. Then there is the issue of the 36 satellites currently sitting on top of the Soyuz in Baikonur. They are the property of OneWeb. They were manufactured in Florida in the US and their handling is therefore subject to strict American export controls covering sensitive technologies. These regulations would have seen the satellites' shipment to Kazakhstan and attachment to the Soyuz rocket overseen by a US official. That official is also no longer present at the spaceport.

Crypto exchange boss rejects Russian user ban,"The boss of one of the world's biggest crypto-currency exchanges has ruled out restricting ordinary Russians from using the service. Binance founder and chief executive Changpeng Zhao, told BBCRadio 4's Today programme: ""Many normal Russians do not agree with war."" Major cryptocurrency exchanges have been asked by Ukraine to block Russian users. One financial expert warned the war could become a ""crypto conflict"". In a tweet sent on Sunday Ukraine's Deputy Prime Minster Mykhailo Fedorov asked major crypto-currency exchanges to block the addresses of ordinary Russian users, not just politicians.

The value of Bitcoin has risen 13% since the Russian invasion of Ukraine, according to the Reuters news agency. There has been speculation Russian oligarchs may pour their money into cryptocurrencies to avoid sanctions and other restrictions. And the Telegraph newspaper called cryptocurrency ""Putin's sanctions-busting super-weapon"". But Mr Zhao said: ""We're not against any people. ""We differentiate between the Russian politicians who start wars and the normal people. ""Many normal Russians do not agree with war."" ""We don't control the industry. ""I can publish my sanction list, you can publish yours... Guess what? No-one else is going to follow. ""It just moves Russian users to other smaller platforms,"" he said. In a statement published earlier, Binance said it would not unilaterally freeze millions of ""innocent users'"" accounts. ""Crypto is meant to provide greater financial freedom for people across the globe,"" the company told BBC News. Any unilateral ban would ""fly in the face"" of the reason crypto existed. But ""while minimising the impact to innocent users"", it was taking the steps necessary to enforce sanctions. Mr Zhao said: ""There are, I think, a few hundred individuals that are on the international sanction list in Russia - those are mostly politicians, et cetera. ""We follow that very, very strictly. ""And we are not in a position to sanction populations of people. ""We are not political - we are against war but we are here to help the people."" Several other cryptocurrency exchanges have also ruled out freezing all Russian accounts, according to aVice News investigation,external. Kraken's chief executive Jesse Powell, for example, said its platform would not freeze Russian accounts, which would go against Bitcoin's ""libertarian values"". Allow Twitter content?

But Tom Keatinge, director of the Centre for Financial Crime and Security Studies (CFCS), at the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think tank, warned exchanges that failed to follow the rules might find themselves cut off from financial services. ""Those banks that provide services to crypto exchanges will be watching their clients' activities very carefully to ensure that they are diligently applying the checks required by the expanding sanctions regimes against Russia,"" he said. The war in Ukraine could become the first meaningful ""crypto conflict"", Mr Keatinge told BBC News, as those seeking to ""evade sanctions, protect their savings or avoid a collapsing banking system turn to cryptocurrencies for solutions"". Criminals laundered $8.6bn (Â£6.4bn) of crypto-currency in 2021, up 30% on the previous year, according to a report by blockchain data company Chainalysis published prior to the invasion. And the Financial Times revealed: ""Trading between the Russian rouble and crypto assets such as Bitcoin and Tether had doubled since the assault on Ukraine began, reaching $60m a day."" The increase comes as governments have sought to cut Russia out of the financial system. On Wednesday, French Finance Minister Bruno le Maire said that the European Union will include crypto currencies in its sanctions against Russia, aimed at making Moscow's aggression against Ukraine as costly as possible. He told journalists during a news conference that the sanctions against Russia were very effective and have ""disorganised"" the Russian financial system. The British government has alsoannounced measures to crack down on money laundering by Russian ""oligarchs and kleptocrats"", including new powers to seize crypto assets. Chainalysis's Caroline Malcolm told BBC News: ""As with the traditional financial system, Russian oligarchs could leverage crypto-currency to evade the sanctions."" But it was unlikely designated persons under sanctions would move around large quantities of cryptocurrency now. ""Russia's elite and financial authorities have been preparing for sanctions for some time,"" she said. ""To the extent that cryptocurrency may be used to evade sanctions related to this crisis, it likely would have happened slowly over the past several months."" And analytics tools used for following money were more effective than those ""capable of disrupting Russia's use of a network of traditional bank wires or physical cash to evade sanctions"". Tom Robinson, of blockchain analysis company Elliptic, said crypto-currency could be an attractive haven for the wealth of oligarchs as it could not be seized and no-one could prevent it being moved. But it was ""highly traceable, which means that they would find it difficult to spend anywhere that sanctions are enforced"".

Journalist wins 'kleptocrat' book libel caseThe High Court dismisses a post-Soviet mining firm's claim an author's book about dirty money was libellous.UK,"Mr Burgis said he was delighted the court action had failed A libel claim brought by a post-Soviet mining giant against a journalist's book about dirty money and corruption has been dismissed by a High Court. Tom Burgis faced potentially huge damages over his book, Kleptopia. But judge Mr Justice Nicklin stopped the case after finding the claim against the author to be wholly flawed. Mr Burgis' publisher said the case had been an attempt to use legal and financial firepower to silence public interest journalism. In the book, Mr Burgis - a Financial Times journalist - charts how he says dirty money is linked to corruption and is now ""flooding the global economy, emboldening dictators [and] poisoning democracies"". Among its stories, the book features Kazakhstan-based Eurasian Natural Resources Corporation (ENRC), a mining company with interests around the world. Lawyers for ENRC claimed in court that Mr Burgis has defamed the corporation because the real meaning of part of his book was that the company had three men murdered to protect its business interests. Andrew Caldecott QC, for Mr Burgis and HarperCollins publishers, told the court: ""This is not a Private Eye nudge-nudge book. ""It is not a book that pulls its punches at all. The theme is about thieves and their money - masters and their secrecy  - and it shows how the thieves are uniting and the terrible human cost."" In a ruling stopping the case, Mr Justice Nicklin said he had read the book for himself before considering the case papers, so he could form a view like any other ordinary reader. He said that ENRC's claim was not sustainable because every reader would know that only individuals can commit murder, rather than corporations. That early ruling meant the case could not proceed to a full libel trial - and the judge awarded Â£50,000 in costs against ENRC, while also refusing it permission to appeal. Speaking outside court, Mr Burgis said: ""I wrote a book about what I believe is the greatest threat to freedom today: the rise of kleptocracy. I'm delighted that this attempt to censor Kleptopia has failed."" He however still faces a second libel action over an article published in the Financial Times relating to his investigation. A spokesman for HarperCollins described the case as ""lawfare"" - legal action that poses such massive financial risks to a defendant it has the effect of silencing them or making them withdraw. ""HarperCollins is committed to publishing high quality investigative non-fiction and to defending our authors in the face of legal attacks from those who would seek to use the UK courts to silence them. ""It is grossly unfair that yet again HarperCollins and our author have had to risk substantial legal costs and personal liability defending public interest journalism."" But a spokesman for ENRC said the case had been fairly brought and insisted there had been enormous damage to its reputation because of the book. ""The independence of the British judiciary remains the UK's greatest defence of our democracy and our shared liberal values,"" said the spokesman. ""It is regretful to have witnessed a growing attempt to mischaracterise our reasonable and proportionate steps to defend our reputation through the courts. ""We have maintained throughout that we fully support the media's right to report fairly and objectively on matters, including on our own business.""

"Abramovich must face sanctions, says Starmer","This video can not be played Starmer: Why is Abramovich not facing sanctions? Roman Abramovich - the owner of Chelsea Football Club - must be among those to face UK sanctions over Ukraine, Sir Keir Starmer has said. The Labour leader accused Boris Johnson of being slow to target individuals who ""prop up"" Vladimir Putin's regime. The PM said he could not comment on individual cases but UK sanctions were already ""having an effect in Moscow"". Mr Abramovich has previously denied having close financial ties with Vladimir Putin or the Kremlin. A spokesperson denied the Labour leader's claims and said Mr Abramovich had not done anything sanctionable. The 55-year-old, who gave ""stewardship and care"" of Chelsea to its foundation trustees following Russia's invasion of Ukraine, has now announced that he is selling the club. Ina statement,external, he said the ""net proceeds"" of the sale would go to a charitable foundation to help ""all victims of the war in Ukraine"". Abramovich says he will sell Chelsea Who is not on the UK sanctions list? Putin has carried out war crimes - Boris Johnson At Prime Minister's Questions, Sir Keir Starmer said: ""We must stand up to Putin and those who prop up his regime. ""Roman Abramovich is the owner of Chelsea Football Club and various other high-value assets in the United Kingdom. ""He's a person of interest to the Home Office because of his links to the Russian state and his public association with corrupt activity and practices. ""Last week, the prime minister said that Abramovich is facing sanctions. He later corrected the record to say that he isn't. Well, why on earth isn't he?"" Roman Abramovich bought Chelsea football club in 2003 Mr Johnson said it is not ""appropriate"" for him to comment on individual cases at this stage. But he told MPs the UK had sanctioned 275 individuals, and a ""further 100 this week"", and had led the way on action against Russian banks. He added: ""What we will publish in addition, is a full list of all those associated with the Putin regime."" Downing Street later added that a significant proportion of those on that list could expect to face sanctions. Boris Johnson has referred to the 100 figure several times in the past week. But when Reality Check asked for the names of the 100, the government could not provide them and said: ""We'll let you know as soon as we have further details to add."" Instead, it sent a list of every person and company currently sanctioned by the UK, including people from Iran and North Korea. It shows that 15 individuals have been sanctioned in the past week. When asked about this, the prime minister's spokesman said there were 100 individuals and entities. Did the UK sanction 100 people last week? Sir Keir asked why Russia's former deputy prime minister Igor Shuvalov, who he said owns two flats in central London ""worth over Â£11m"", was not on the UK sanctions list when he was being targeted by EU sanctions. Shuvalov's properties are registered under a company owned by the Russian politician and his wife, said Sir Keir. ""We only know which oligarch lurks beneath that shell company because of the information obtained and disclosed by Alexei Navalny. Navalny, of course, was poisoned by the Russian state and he now sits in a Putin jail,"" added the Labour leader. He said transparency was ""essential to rooting out corruption"", adding: ""I'm ashamed that we only know about Shuvalov's Westminster flats because a dissident risked his life. Is the prime minister?"" This video can not be played Watch MPs in UK Parliament stand and clap for the Ukrainian ambassador, who was attending Prime Minister's Questions Mr Johnson said: ""The UK of course is doing everything that we can to expose ill-gotten Russian loot and this has been something that we have been working on for a long time, and we actually were the first to impose sanctions on those who were guilty of the poisoning of Alexei Navalny."" He told MPs measures being brought forward next week to expose the ownership of properties will ""continue to tighten the noose around Putin's regime"". Boris Johnson is under pressure to punish more Russian oligarchs with sanctions. The prime minister is now promising a ""full list"" of those associated with the Putin regime but in Whitehall there's no clear sense yet of exactly how this will work. Labour and Conservative MPs are using Parliamentary privilege to name individuals but ministers have to be more careful. UK officials say cases need to be built in a way that's legally robust and it's too simplistic to see this as a numbers games or a competition with the EU to see who can freeze the most assets. The aim is to impose the highest economic cost on President Putin and his regime, which is more likely to come from restrictions on Russian defence companies and banks than individuals. But they do want to identify those who have real influence and significance, a proven association with Putin - and they aren't necessarily the names most familiar to the British public. What everyone is keen to avoid is a situation where a list is published before sanctions are imposed and all it does is tip off individuals who then move quickly to protect their assets. Under the government'sEconomic Crime Bill,external, a register will force anonymous foreign owners of UK property to reveal their identities to prevent criminals hiding behind secretive shell companies. Sir Keir said Labour would help vote through the long-awaited legislation on Monday ""at speed"", but he said it would not come into force for existing property owners like Shuvalov for 18 months. ""At best, that's Autumn 2023. Far too long for the Ukrainian people. Why are we giving Putin's cronies 18 months to quietly launder their money out of the UK property market and into another safe haven?"" He also called for measures to be added to the bill to overhaul Companies House - where directors register companies - to deter criminals from setting up shell firms. Mr Johnson said he was happy to work with Labour next week to ""strengthen and accelerate the package of measures"" in the bill. He also suggested, in response to a question from Conservative MP Bob Seely, that law firms representing oligarchs with links to Putin could ""face sanctions"". Mr Seely claimed law firms ""intimidate into silence"" those who would investigate offshore money flows, including the media or ""even the National Crime Agency"". ""Does the prime minister understand this is how state corruption happens and this is systemic, planned subversion?,"" asked the Isle of Wight MP. Mr Johnson said law firms were reminded on 23 February of the ""need to comply with sanctions regulations and legislation,"" adding: ""Clearly they will face sanctions if they fail to do so."" Labour MP Chris Bryant. who has led calls for Roman Abramovich to be sanctioned, also named a series of individuals at Prime Minister's Questions. ""We are not even sanctioning Sergey Shoygu, the Russian defence minister, yet. Nor Igor Osipov, the commander of the Black Sea fleet,"" said the chairman of the Commons standards committee. He added: ""Why don't we use parliamentary privilege to get this out there so the lawyers can't attack the sanctions that we must surely bring, rapidly, today?""

Ukrainian city of Mariupol 'near to catastrophe',"Emergency services in the aftermath of a strike on a TV tower in Kyiv on Tuesday that killed five The key Ukrainian port city of Mariupol was ""near to a humanitarian catastrophe"" on Wednesday after more than 15 hours of continuous bombardment by Russian forces, the city's deputy mayor told the BBC. ""The Russian army is working through all their weapons here - artillery, multiple rocket launch systems, airplanes, tactical rockets. They are trying to destroy the city,"" Serhiy Orlov said. Mr Orlov said Russian forces were several kilometres from the city on all sides and had launched strikes on key infrastructure, cutting water and power supplies to parts of the city. One densely populated residential district on the city's left bank had been ""nearly totally destroyed"", he said. ""We cannot count the number of victims there, but we believe at least hundreds of people are dead. We cannot go in to retrieve the bodies. My father lives there, I cannot reach him, I don't know if he is alive or dead."" Russian forces had targeted strikes against pump stations and electrical transformers, Mr Orlov said, and there were food shortages in parts of the city - raising fears of an approaching humanitarian crisis. Mariupol is a key strategic target for Russia because seizing it would allow Russian-backed separatist forces in eastern Ukraine to join forces with troops in Crimea, the southern peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014. Ukraine's army has resisted Russian forces so far in key parts of the country but the increased aerial bombardment of cities has raised fears Russia is shifting tactics. ""The Ukrainian army is very brave and they will continue to defend the city but the style of the Russian army is like pirates - they do not fight with their army, they just destroy entire districts,"" Mr Orlov said. ""We believe in our Ukrainian army, but we are in a terrible situation."" Russia's invasion of Ukraine took a heavy toll on civilians on Wednesday as residential neighbourhoods in several large cities were bombed. Ukraine's emergency services said more than 2,000 civilians had been killed so far during the Russian invasion, though the BBC was not able to independently verify the figure. The UN said on Tuesday that at least 136 civilians had been killed, but it estimated that the actual number was higher. There were fears on Wednesday that the death toll would rise dramatically as Russian troops appeared to surround the country's second-largest city, Kharkiv, and the port city of Kherson. Ukrainian forces said Russian paratroopers had landed near Kharkiv on Wednesday, leading to street fighting on the outskirts of the city. Local officials said a cruise missile hit a city council meeting, blowing off the top of the building and wounding three. At least 18 people have been reported killed in the city in the past day. A fire at the a Kharkiv university building after it was hit by a Russian missile on Wednesday Residents in Kharkiv told the BBC they were experiencing heavy aerial bombardment. ""It is exhausting and terrifying living under this pressure,"" said Iryna Ruzhynska, 40, who was sheltering with her family in her second-floor apartment on Wednesday. ""We have put Scotch tape on the windows and pillows by the window stills,"" Ms Ruzhynska said. ""We don't turn on the lights, only the torches on our phones. We managed to go to the store yesterday, but we queued for four hours and there was virtually no food left."" The Russian defence ministry claimed its forces were in control of Kherson, a city of nearly 250,000 people just north of Crimea, but local authorities said the city was still under Ukrainian control, despite being surrounded. Video footage verified by the BBC appeared to show Russian troops in the centre of Kherson. LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine? RUSSIA SANCTIONS:'If I could leave, I would' UKRAINE:Desperate scenes in Lviv train station IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict Larysa Pavlovska, a 58-year-old paramedic in Kherson, told the BBC her part of the city was quiet on Wednesday but other parts were smouldering after intense overnight shelling, adding that some residential districts had been ""bombed out"". ""Local residents say Russian armoured vehicles can be seen moving in the city, people say about 50 units,"" she said. ""They have been spotted by the state regional administration building."" Inesa Chamlai, the deputy head of the emergency aid centre in Kherson, said Russian troops had prevented them taking a wounded 55-year-old man to hospital. The man had stepped on a mine and lost his leg, Mr Chamlai said. ""Our ambulance team was dispatched but was then prevented by Russian troops from taking the man to hospital,"" he said. ""The soldiers ordered to bring him back to his house where he will definitely die."" There were also growing fears in the capital, Kyiv, over a 40-mile long convoy of Russian military vehicles just 15 miles north of the city, though US officials said on Wednesday the column was barely moving. In Irpin, close to Kyiv, residential buildings have been destroyed Russia's air force struck a television mast in the capital on Tuesday, killing five people at the site of a Nazi massacre which killed more than 33,000, mostly Jews, while a missile strike west of Kyiv, in the city of Zhytomyr, killed four people including a child, a Ukrainian official said. In a video message on Wednesday, Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky, who is Jewish, condemned the strike at the site of the massacre, accusing the Russians of trying to ""erase"" Ukrainians. ""They know nothing about our capital. About our history. But they have an order to erase our history. Erase our country. Erase us all,"" he said. A UK government spokesperson said Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke to Mr Zelensky on Wednesday ""to condemn the abhorrent attacks on Ukraine in the recent hours and days"". In an address on Tuesday, the US president Joe Biden called Russian President Vladimir Putin a ""dictator"" and promised ""robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted at Russia's economy"". Nearly a week after invading, Russia is facing increasing economic turmoil at home as it is hit by increasing sanctions. The Moscow Stock Exchange remained closed for the third day in a row on Wednesday as authorities tried to limit the impact of the sanctions. ""The Russian economy has suffered a serious blow,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, insisting that it was ""still standing"". Have you been affected by any of the issues raised here?

Fighting escalates despite Ukraine ceasefire talks,"A destroyed Ukrainian vehicle after shelling in Kharkiv Fighting continued on Monday, the fifth day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, despite talks aimed at securing a ceasefire. Missile strikes killed dozens of civilians in the country's second city, Kharkiv, while air raid sirens sounded again in the capital, Kyiv. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky called the Russian bombardment of Kharkiv a ""war crime"". There were reports of fierce shelling in the northern city of Chernihiv. Russia is attacking Ukraine on several fronts, but its advance has been slowed by Ukrainian resistance. All three cities remain under Ukrainian control. Away from the battlefields, economic and diplomatic moves have continued. President Vladimir Putin has banned Russians from moving money abroad as he tries to halta plunge in the value of the roublefollowing the imposition of sanctions. And a rare emergency session of the United Nations General Assembly has heard a demand from the secretary general for an immediate halt to hostilities. On the northern border with Belarus, Ukrainian and Russian officials ended their first round of talks. There was little expectation the session would bring a breakthrough, but a Ukrainian official said both sides would now return to their respective capitals for further consultations before a second round of negotiations. Russia said both sides had agreed to continue talking and would meet again ""in the next few days"". In other developments: Canada banned Russian oil imports More than half a million people have fledtheir homes to escape the war in Ukraine, the UN says President Putin put Russia's nuclear forces on high alert aftercomments by UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and others, the Kremlin has said Mr Putin and French President Emmanuel Macron have had a telephone conversation in which the Russian leader called for Moscow's legitimate security interests to be addressed Football's world governing body, Fifa, and Europe's governing body, Uefa, havesuspended Russian clubs and national teams from all competitions New members have been joining the Territorial Defence Forces in Kyiv In a late-night address, Mr Zelensky said there were eyewitness accounts of civilians being deliberately targeted during a sustained attack on Kharkiv. He called for the West to consider a no-fly zone over Ukraine - something the US so far ruled out over fears it could draw it into a direct conflict with Russia. Videos shared on social media showed rockets landing in Kharkiv, in what some defence analysts described as typical of a cluster munition strike on a dense urban area. Russia has previously denied targeting residential areas. New satellite images showed a Russian military convoy stretching for about 40 miles (64km) north of Kyiv. But reports of fresh fighting on the outskirts of the capital forced residents back into their shelters on Monday evening. This video can not be played The cities of Kharkiv and Chernihiv faced heavy shelling on the fifth day of Russia's invasion Another video circulating on social media showed huge clouds of smoke at a burning shopping centre in Chernihiv, another city that has been under pressure from the Russian offensive. One teacher in Chernihiv, Oksana Buryak, told the BBC the situation was ""like from some horror movie"". ""Our hearts are broken, we don't understand anything,"" she said. This video can not be played A resident in Donetsk asks ""How much longer until this is over?"" as buildings in the city are destroyed. To the south, Russian forces are trying to take control of the key strategic port of Mariupol, near Russia-annexed Crimea. Ukraine denied reports that Zaporizhzhia, home to Europe's largest nuclear power plant, had fallen into Russia hands. Ukrainian Interior Minister Denys Monastyrskyy, speaking to the BBC, said the situation across the country was ""serious, but stable"". ""Every day the enemy sends more and more forces. But our glorious armed forces are basically destroying everything that arrives to Kyiv,"" he added. The UN human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, said millions of civilians were being forced to huddle in makeshift bomb shelters such as underground rail stations to escape explosions. Since the invasion began on Thursday, her office has recorded 102 civilian deaths, including seven children - and more than 300 injured. ""The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher,"" she said. Lyse Doucet, BBC News, Kyiv A cold Kyiv day, the fifth day of Russia's invasion, had dawned with a weekend curfew ending, peace talks starting, and a bright sun rising in the winter sky. But the chilling wail of the air raid siren soon sounded. It kept piercing the quiet of a city drained of its normal rhythms. After the sun set, it almost seemed to be on a loop. No one here wonders why. As darkness fell, an explosion rocked the centre of Kyiv, shaking buildings in the city centre for the first time. Some reports said they were targeting a military radar centre in the Brovary suburb. Residents in high-rise apartment blocks there told us it was ""very close, very frightening"". Russian forces seem to be inching closer to the city centre, the prize in this war. Ukrainian forces have been stalling their advance. And tonight the night sky was lit by surface-to-air missiles targeting Russian warplanes and helicopters. To sum up the view of a Western official who spoke to journalists today, the Russians seem to have overestimated its own military prowess, underestimated Ukrainian resolve, miscalculated the world's reaction and misunderstood the mood of our time. But other Ukrainian cities give a glimpse of may lie in wait for Kyiv. In the north-west, Ukraine's second-largest city Kharkiv has been pounded by suspected cluster munitions. In the north-east, siege tactics used to devastating effect in Syria are being unleashed around the historic city of Chernihiv; shells are also slamming into its streets. A woman I met in a shelter today anxiously told me of her father's plight. He's in Chernobyl, to the north, now occupied by Russian forces, without electricity or much of a phone signal, trying to hide the light of a burning fire now cooking his potato soup.

Airbus joins rival Boeing in cutting Russia ties,"The A320neo is key to Airbus's plans Airbus has joined rival planemaker Boeing and oil giant ExxonMobil on a growing list of corporate giants cutting ties with Russia. The European manufacturer said it had stopped support and supply of spare parts for Russia's aviation industry. Earlier, Boeing suspended operations and ExxonMobil said it would end a multi-billion dollar joint venture with Russian state-owned company Rosneft. Firms are exiting Russia after the West imposed sanctions over Ukraine. Airbus said on Wednesday: ""In line with international sanctions now in place, Airbus has suspended support services to Russian airlines, as well as the supply of spare part to the country. ""Services provided by the Airbus Engineering Centre in Russia (ECAR) have also been suspended pending further review."" US aviation giant Boeing said it had suspended ""major operations"" in Moscow and temporarily closed its office in Ukraine's capital Kyiv. ""We are also suspending parts, maintenance and technical support services for Russian airlines,"" a Boeing spokesperson told the BBC. ExxonMobil is the latest oil producer to cut business ties with the country, after similar moves by BP, Shell and Equinor. ""We deplore Russia's military action that violates the territorial integrity of Ukraine and endangers its people,""Texas-based ExxonMobil said in a statement,external. ""We are deeply saddened by the loss of innocent lives and support the strong international response,"" it added. ExxonMobil currently operates and holds a stake in the Sakhalin Island oil and gas fields, alongside Rosneft and companies from Japan and India. It said it would now exit its Russian oil and gas operations, which have been valued at more than $4bn (Â£3bn), and halt new investments in the country. Last year, ExxonMobil employed more than 1,000 people across the country, with offices in Moscow, St. Petersburg, Yekaterinburg and Yuzhno-Sakhalinst, according to its website. Russia is one of the world's biggest energy producers. The announcement came as Brent crude -the international benchmark for oil prices - hit $113 a barrel, marking the highest level seen in more than seven years. Allow Twitter content?

Russia doubles interest rate after rouble slumps,"People stand in line to use an ATM money machine in St Petersburg on Sunday Russia has more than doubled its interest rate to 20% in a bid to halt a slump in the value of its currency. The Bank of Russia raised the rate from 9.5% after the rouble sank 30% after new Western sanctions. The currency then eased back to about 20% down. The collapse in value erodes the currency's buying power and could wipe out the savings of ordinary Russians. Amid pictures at the weekend of queues at cash machines, Russia said it had the resources to ride out sanctions. President Vladimir Putin on Monday responded to the sanctions with an order barring citizens from transferring money outside of Russia, including for debt payments. Moscow's stock market, which saw heavy losses last week as investors sold, is to be closed for a second day on Tuesday. Ahead of an emergency meeting between President Vladimir Putin and his economic advisers on Monday, Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said: ""These are heavy sanctions, they're problematic, but Russia has the necessary potential to compensate the damage from these sanctions."" What is Swift and why is banning Russia so significant? What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? The UK, along with the US and EU, cut off major Russian banks from financial markets in the West, prohibiting dealings with the central bank, state-owned investment funds and the finance ministry. The moves sent the rouble tumbling. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the measures demonstrated the UK's ""determination to apply severe economic sanctions in response to Russia's invasion of Ukraine"". Russia has about $630bn (Â£470bn) in reserves - a stockpile of savings - built up from soaring oil and gas prices. But because a lot of this money is stored in foreign currencies like the dollar, the euro and sterling as well as gold, the Western ban on dealing with Russia's central bank restricts Moscow from accessing the cash. Last week, Russia's central bank was forced to increase the amount of money it supplies to ATMs after demand for cash reached the highest level since March 2020. Videos on social media on Sunday appeared to show long queues forming at cash machines and money exchanges in Moscow, with people worried that their bank cards may stop working or that limits will be placed on the amount of cash they can withdraw. Chris Weafer, chief executive at consultancy firm Micro-Advisory and based in Moscow, said on Monday he was seeing some queues in food stores. ""You are beginning to see a little bit of queuing in some grocery stores, particularly people buying some goods that they think might come into short supply due to trade restrictions or maybe will be subject to big price increases because of the rouble devaluation. ""This set of sanctions is hitting ordinary Russians to an extent that previous sanctions have not and people are now becoming aware of that. ""People are a lot more fearful. There is already talk about some companies having to either go on reduced working hours, or even suspend production because they're not able to access maybe key parts from the West due to sanctions or due to trade limitations, so there's a great deal of concern on the street."" Moscow resident Anastasia told Reuters that she expected her economic situation to get worse.  ""It's inevitable in these circumstances,"" she added. Whilst another Moscow resident Sergey said he was already seeing an impact. ""Prices are rising, of course, savings are shrinking and stocks are falling."" On Monday, the central bank said it had ordered brokers to suspend the execution of all orders by foreign legal entities and individuals to sell Russian investments. The sanctions that have been imposed by the EU, the US, the UK and others are unprecedented. It's one thing to block the foreign reserves of a country like Iran or Venezuela, quite another to act against Russia - a country with a major role in global trade and a very significant supplier of oil and gas. The reaction on the currency markets has been dramatic - with the rouble plummeting, despite the central bank's efforts to prop it up using interest rates. There may already have been a rush to the foreign currency ATMs in Russian cities, but citizens there have yet to feel the full impact. At the very least prices will rise dramatically; banking collapses, hyperinflation and a deep recession are all potential consequences. But sanctions are a two-way street. Cutting the central bank off from its reserves and limiting Russian institutions' access to the Swift network will not only hurt Russia - western institutions also face losses from debts that cannot or will not be repaid, for example. And then there is the risk of countermeasures from Russia - potentially hitting energy exports. Such sweeping sanctions being imposed in such a unified way is remarkable. It's also a very big gamble. Attempts to put a stranglehold around Russia's finances reverberated across the financial and corporate world: The price of crude oil jumped to $101 per barrel, and the dollar and gold rose as investors sought safer places to put their money. The price of gas for delivery over the next couple of months soared by 24%. European markets tumbled at the open amid fears over financial stability, but later pared losses with London's FTSE 100 closing down 0.4%. Paris fell 1.3% and Frankfurt 0.7%. BP's share priceslumped more than 6% after it decided to exit Russian oil and gas operationsat a cost of up to $25bn. Shell also said it would quit its Russian ventures. Russian gold producer Polymetal was the biggest faller on the FTSE 100, down 56%, while shares in Evraz - the steel firm controlled by Roman Abramovich and Alexander Abramov - sank 29%. US markets were mixed, with the Dow closing down 0.5%, the S&P 500 off 0.2%, while the Nasdaq gained 0.4%. The major exchanges temporarily halted trading of Russian stocks to understand the impact of the sanctions. US bank Citigroup was among the biggest losers, falling more than 4.4% after the firm disclosed nearly $10bn in exposure to Russia, including more than $5bn in loans, securities and funding commitments Equinor, the energy firm majority owned by the Norway government, started to divest its joint ventures in Russia. Wheat prices saw their biggest one-day gain in a decade on supply worries from Russia and Ukraine. Switzerland also said it would follow the European Union's sanctions, breaking its tradition of neutrality. Will Walker-Arnott, senior investment manager at Charles Stanley, told the BBC's Today programme that ""it looks like Russia is increasingly becoming an economic pariah, increasingly isolated from the global financial system"". Cutting some Russian banks from international payments system Swift is among the harshest measureso far imposed to date on Moscow over the Ukraine conflict. The assets of Russia's central bank will also be frozen, limiting the country's ability to access its overseas reserves. Russia is heavily reliant on the Swift system for its key oil and gas exports. It was not clear whether those deals would be exempt from the bans. The intention is to ""further isolate Russia from the international financial system"", a joint statement said. On Monday, the European Central Bank (ECB) said several European subsidiaries of Sberbank Russia, which is Russia's largest bank and majority owned by the Russian government, were failing or likely to fail due to reputational cost of the war in Ukraine. Sberbank Europe AG, which had total assets of â¬13.64bn (Â£11.4bn) at the end of last year, along with its Croatian and Slovenian units, suffered a rapid deposit outflow in recent days and is likely to fail to pay its debts or other liabilities, said the ECB, which is the lenders' supervisor.

UK sanctions Belarus for role in Ukraine invasion,"Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko is a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin The UK has targeted Belarusian army chiefs as part of its first wave of sanctions against Belarus for its role in Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Four defence officials and two military enterprises are included in the package. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko had aided and abetted Russia's invasion. Mr Lukashenko has hosted Russian forces and allowed them to use Belarus as a staging ground. A close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Mr Lukashenko's administration has become increasingly reliant on Russia for economic, political and military support in recent years. Mr Putin backed Mr Lukashenko after he claimed a disputed election victory in 2020, sparking mass protests that almost ousted him from power. Belarus crackdown fails to crush opposition spirit Fear and violence in the jails of Belarus Lukashenko: We may have helped migrants into EU In January this year,Belarus hosted large joint military drills with Russiaas western leaders issued increasingly grave warnings of a possible attack on Ukraine. The exercises were extended and then Belarus announced that the Russian troops would remain in the country, citing ""the aggravation of the situation"" in eastern Ukraine. But on Monday, Mr Lukashenko said Belarus had no plans to join Russia's military operation in Ukraine, according to state news agency Belta. Mr Lukashenko denied Ukraine's allegations that Russian troops were attacking from Belarus's territory, Belta's report said. Announcing sanctions on Tuesday,external, the UK government accused Belarus of ""facilitating the invasion from within its borders"". Those sanctioned include: Belarus's deputy defence minister, Major GeneralVictor Gulevich, who is ""responsible for directing the actions of the Belarusian armed forces"" Major GeneralAndrei Burdyko, a logistics chief; Major GeneralSergei Simonenko, an arms chief; and Major GeneralAndrey Zhuk, Belarus's deputy minister of defence Also sanctioned areJSC Integral, a military semi-conductor manufacturer, andJSC 558 Aircraft Repair Plant, which provides maintenance and servicing to military aircraft at an air base from which Russian aircraft have operated Ms Truss said Belarus ""will be made to feel the economic consequences for its support for Putin"". ""We are inflicting economic pain on Putin and those closest to him. We will not rest until Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity is restored."" The UK says it has already imposed sanctions on more than 100 people and organisations in response to the ""fraudulent elections"" and ""human rights violations"" in Belarus. Suggesting further sanctions could be imposed on Belarus over the Ukraine invasion, the foreign secretary said ""nothing - and no one - is off the table"". Belarusian and Russian forces took part in joint military exercises in Belarus ahead of the invasion of Ukraine Tuesday's Belarus sanctions came as MPs approved new measures against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. The package includes a full asset freeze for all Russian banks, as well as new powers to limit them from clearing payments in sterling. A ban has also been enacted on a range of exports critical to Russia's military and strategic interests. The sanctions are in alignment with the US, European Union and others to collectively cut off much of Russia's high-tech imports, the government said. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Russians feel the pain of international sanctions The measures were announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who told the House of Commons last week they were ""the largest and most severe package of economic sanctions that Russia has ever seen"". Labour and Conservative MPs have called on the government to strengthen the sanctions regime in order to put further pressure on Russia. Labour shadow foreign minister Stephen Doughty urged ministers to ""go even faster and further"", warning in some cases the sanctions had been ""off the pace"" compared with the UK's allies. Conservative former cabinet minister David Davis said action was needed against the ""140 or so oligarchs"" identified as having ""direct links"" with President Putin.

Half a million flee Ukraine as fighting rages,"A temporary camp has been set up in Przemysl, Poland, for some of the hundreds of thousands fleeing Ukraine More than half a million people have fled their homes to escape the war in Ukraine, the UN says, as heavy fighting continues across the country. Major cities - including Kyiv, Kharkiv, and Chernihiv - remain under attack from Russian forces. A government official said dozens of civilians were killed in Kharkiv as shelling continued into the morning. On the northern border with Belarus, Ukrainian and Russian officials are meeting for talks for the first time. Hopes for a breakthrough are slim - but Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky said there was a ""small chance to end the war"". The United Nations human rights chief, Michelle Bachelet, said millions of civilians were being forced to huddle in makeshift bomb shelters such as underground rail stations to escape explosions. Since the invasion began on Thursday, her office has recorded 102 civilian deaths, including seven children - and more than 300 injured. ""The real figures are, I fear, considerably higher,"" she said. In the capital, Kyiv, the bulk of Russian forces are about 30km (19 miles) outside the north of the city, slowed by fierce Ukrainian resistance, according to the UK Ministry of Defence. But street-level fighting continues in several parts of the city. Despite the danger, a two-day curfew has been lifted, with residents emerging from underground shelters to buy food and gather supplies. Kasenya, who spent more than 36 hours underground, told the BBC she had managed to get home. ""I can't describe how I am feeling, I'm happy to stay alive and safe and just have the possibility to see my splendid and beautiful Kyiv,"" she said. ""Even underground, everyone is trying to help one another and help our army to be stronger and to spread the world about our situation here.""

Shells landed near a shopping centre in Kharkiv during the day, while fighting continued in the streets. Anton Herashchenko, an adviser to the interior minister, posted to Facebook: """"Kharkiv has just come under massive shelling from Grads [multiple rocket launchers]. Dozens have been killed and hundreds wounded!"" To the south, Russian forces are trying to take control of the key strategic port of Mariupol, near Russia-annexed Crimea. Ukraine denied reports that Zaporizhzhia, home to Europe's largest nuclear power plant, had fallen into Russia hands. By Orla Guerin in Kyiv As the curfew lifted at 08:00 on day five of the Russian invasion, small numbers of people began to emerge on to the sunlit streets in Kyiv. Since the curfew was imposed on Saturday night, there has been a change in the city - more checkpoints, more sandbags and more tension. We drove past a blue Lada car, stopped in the middle of the road. There were bullet holes along one side, and the driver was slumped - dead - over the wheel. He had been shot in the head. Suddenly Ukrainian troops - in a concealed position - started shouting at us to go.  We don't know the circumstances but it's possible the driver was suspected of being a Russian saboteur. The security forces are hunting for them inside the city. For some, today was a chance to try to flee. Mid-morning, as an air raid siren wailed, we met a group of about 30 students from India, rushing to the railway station, dragging their cases behind them. They said they had heard reports that foreign students were being prevented from getting on trains. One medical student told me that in this time of war, they hoped all people would be treated the same.  In any case they weren't planning to rely on the train.  They had booked their own bus. As the Ukrainian delegation arrived for talks near the Belarusian border, President Zelensky gave a speech to the nation, saying that 16 children had been killed in the four days since the invasion began. He implored Russian troops to lay down their weapons and leave the country. And he called on the European Union to make Ukraine a member immediately. ""We are grateful to the partners that they stand with us,"" he said. ""But our goal is to be with all Europeans and, most importantly, to be equal. I'm sure that's fair. I am sure we deserved it."" There is speculation that troops from Belarus could join the fight on the side of Russia, to which it is closely aligned. Reports in US media, and Ukrainian news outlet the Kyiv Independent, suggest that a troop deployment is possible as soon as Monday. Belarus has acted as a springboard for Russian troops since the invasion began. Its government voted on Sunday to renounce its non-nuclear status - paving the way for Russia to potentially stage nuclear weapons there.

That coincided with Russian President Vladimir Putin putting its deterrence forces, which include nuclear weapons, on ""special alert"". The announcement does not mean Russia intends to use the weapons, but was widely perceived as a threat. UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallacetold media the move was to ""remind the world that he has a deterrent"" and distract people from ""what's going wrong in Ukraine"". ""We're all talking about it.

Russia's Kharkiv attacks are war crimes - Zelensky,"This video can not be played Watch: The moment Kyiv TV tower was struck by a Russian missile Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of war crimes after it launched air strikes on the country's second city, Kharkiv. At least 10 people were killed and 35 hurt when an opera house, a concert hall and government offices were struck in Kharkiv's Freedom Square on Tuesday. Later, Ukraine's military said Russian troops had parachuted into Kharkiv in an effort to capture the besieged city. The military said there were immediate clashes after the paratroopers landed. Earlier on Tuesday, the main TV tower in the capital Kyiv was also hit, knocking media off air and killing five people. Moscow warned residents near Kyiv's military areas to leave their homes. The explosion sent smoke billowing from the steel structure, but the tower remains standing. A nearby memorial to victims of the Holocaust was damaged in the same strike. The Babyn Yar ravine is Europe's largest mass grave of the Holocaust where more than 70,000 people, mostly Jews, were shot by the Nazis. Mr Zelensky said on Twitter,externalthat the attack was ""history repeating..."". ""What is the point of saying 'never again' for 80 years, if the world stays silent when a bomb drops on the same site of Babyn Yar?"" Satellite images reveal a huge Russian military convoy snaking towards Kyiv, amid fears of an all-out assault on the capital. But a senior US defence official said there had been ""no appreciable movement"" by the 40-mile (64km) convoy on Tuesday. There were indications that morale was flagging among Russian troops in general, and some units were surrendering, sometimes without a fight, the official added.

Later the parliament said it would look at a request by Ukraine for candidate status of the EU. The Ukrainian president condemned the attacks on Kharkiv as ""state terrorism on the part of Russia"". Video footage showed a missile hitting the local government building and exploding, causing a massive fireball and blowing out windows of surrounding buildings. Freedom Square is the second largest city-centre square in Europe and a landmark of the city. Residents of Kharkiv told the BBC they were living in ""hell"" because of apparent attacks on civilians. Yulia, a married mother of three, said the Russians were targeting areas with no military infrastructure. ""They've been bombing... a residential area where tens of thousands of people live - mothers, children,"" she said. ""We have very many injured... This is hell."" Another resident told the Newshour programme she and her husband and children were living in a bomb shelter because they did not know where the shelling would strike next. Joel Gunter, BBC News, Ukraine Just 30 miles from the border and largely Russian speaking, Kharkiv has long been considered an obvious target for this invasion. Russian troops have engaged in street combat there with Ukrainian soldiers defending the city, and the city has been heavily bombarded from the air, killing scores of civilians at least. Residents who spoke to the BBC on Tuesday described spending long nights in cramped bomb shelters or, for those with no access underground, in the hallways of their apartments, away from windows. Iryna Ruzhynska, 40, was sheltering on Tuesday in the hallway of her second-floor apartment in a 16-floor building, with her two sons, daughter-in-law and grandchild. Ruzhynska's mother, who is 75, was trapped in her own 11th-floor apartment because the building's lift was out of order. ""We have put scotch tape on the windows and pillows by the window stills,"" Ruzhynska said. ""We don't turn on the lights, only the torches on our phones. We managed to go to the store yesterday, but we queued for four hours and there was virtually no food left."" A street nearby Ruzhynska's apartment was shelled on Monday, she said - a thumping blast that left body parts strewn around the street. When she opens her window she can hear gunfire and bombing. ""It is exhausting and terrifying living under this pressure,"" she said. ""And I am angry, because this is a big, beautiful city, my city, and they want to wipe it from the face of the Earth.""

Russia's defence ministry said it was not targeting cities, only military infrastructure, and that there was no threat to the civilian population. The sixth day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine saw continued attacks on several fronts, but the Russian advance has reportedly been slowed by Ukrainian resistance. There are reports of shelling and street fighting in the southern city ofKherson, andMariupol, a port city also in the south of Ukraine, is without electricity after an intense bombardment. Four people, including a child, were killed when their homes were struck inZhytomyron Tuesday by a Russian air strike, apparently aimed at a nearby military base, a Ukrainian official said. More than 600,000 people across Ukraine have fled their homesto escape the fighting, according to the United Nations, and Kyiv says more than 350 civilians, including 13 children, have been killed in Ukraine since the invasion began. Ukraine has also reported that more than 70 of its soldiers have been killed, while Russia has not released figures for its own losses, amid Ukrainian claims of thousands of deaths.

Ryanair boss: Air fares will be higher this summer,"Ryanair boss Michael O'Leary has warned that air fares this summer will be ""materially higher"" due to soaring oil prices and Covid effects. He said the impact of the Ukraine crisis on oil prices was ""steep and severe"". Airlines also had fewer seats available after cutting capacity during the Covid pandemic, he said. In February Air-France KLM warned of airlines pushing up prices as they face rising overheads. Crude oil prices are surging as markets react to Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Oil and gas is still flowing from Russia, but there's concern that sanctions could tighten supply, or that Russia could decide to restrict supplies. Mr O'Leary said that Ryanair was largely insulated from surging prices due to fuel-buying agreements until 2023 that cap the cost for 80% of its fuel. However, price rises on the remaining fifth of its fuel mean Ryanair expects to pay an extra â¬50m (Â£42m), he said. Oil and gas surge sparks fears over new bill rises Air fare rises are unavoidable, warns Air France-KLM How are travel rules being relaxed? Short-haul capacity in Europe would be reduced by 10% this summer, and that would also drive higher fares in the peak months, when prices would be ""materially higher"", he said. Mr O'Leary predicted that air fares would be 10% to 15% higher than pre-Covid in June, July, August and September and accommodation would also be more expensive. ""I think you're going to see families returning to the beaches of Europe this year,"" due to pent up demand, he added. The warningsecho those made by the UK boss of Air France-KLMFahmi Mahjoub in February, who said his airline faced significantly higher fuel and airport costs, and as a result higher air fares were ""quite unavoidable"". Speaking to reporters on Wednesday, Mr O'Leary said his airline would be the first to fly to and from Ukraine again, when it was safe to do so and airspace reopened. But he said that may not be until the winter. Russia has taken out most of the radar infrastructure at Ukrainian airports, he said, adding that he wanted to see the Ukrainians ""succeed"". Mr O'Leary said on Tuesday that Ryanair had started flying medical supplies and humanitarian aid in the hold of flights to south eastern Poland, free of charge, on behalf of Irish and UK humanitarian agencies. Ryanair has seen a significant surge to and from Polish airports. Mr O'Leary said a lot of people who had come across the border from Ukraine to Poland ""are flying across Europe reuniting with friends and family"". He said Ryanair was keeping air fares low because it wanted to play its part in reuniting them. Before the crisis, Ryanair was the biggest airline flying to Ukraine, serving four airports there. It had expected to fly two million passengers on those routes this year. He also said Ryanair carrying humanitarian supplies was ""for the first time in 30 years"". Mr O'Leary added that Ryanair flight bookings had dropped 20% when the invasion began and were still about 10% down.

Roman Abramovich's Chelsea future in doubt,"Chelsea have been owned by Roman Abramovich since 2003 Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich says he is planning to sell the club. In a statement on the Premier League club's website, businessman Abramovich said he had made the ""incredibly difficult decision"" which ""pains"" him. The Russian will not ask ""for any loans to be repaid"" and said proceeds of the sale would be donated to war victims. Abramovich had said on Saturday he would give""stewardship and care""of Chelsea to its foundation trustees following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. That led to speculation Abramovich - who has loaned the club more than Â£1.5bn - would put Chelsea up for sale, and billionaire Hansjorg Wyss told Swiss newspaperBlick,externalon Wednesday that he had been offered the chance to buy the club. Wyss said Abramovich wanted ""to get rid of Chelsea quickly"" after the threat of sanctions was raised in Parliament. Abramovich, 55, is alleged to have strong ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin, which he has denied. He said ""all net proceeds from the sale"" would be donated to the ""victims of the war in Ukraine"". BBC Sport understands Abramovich has already received offers for Chelsea and that he values the club at as much as Â£3bn. In his statement, Abramovich said: ""I have always taken decisions with the club's best interest at heart. ""In the current situation, I have therefore taken the decision to sell the club, as I believe this is in the best interest of the club, the fans, the employees, as well as the club's sponsors and partners. ""The sale of the club will not be fast-tracked but will follow due process. I will not be asking for any loans to be repaid. ""I have instructed my team to set up a charitable foundation where all net proceeds from the sale will be donated. The foundation will be for the benefit of all victims of the war in Ukraine."" BBC Sport understands the trustees of Chelsea's charitable foundation, who had not yet agreed to take control of the club, will no longer be asked to. Abramovich was criticised for not referencing Russia's invasion of Ukraine in that original statement on Saturday. Chelsea's players were not told ahead of time about their owner's new statement, which was released less than a hour before the side's FA Cup fifth-round tie at Luton Town. After falling behind early on, thePremier League team won 3-2to reach the quarter-finals. Abramovich bought Chelsea in 2003 for Â£140m, and in his statement said it had ""never been about business nor money, but about pure passion for the game and club"". This video can not be played Roman Abramovich: Alan Shearer & Micah Richards react to news of Chelsea sale Since his purchase of the club, Chelsea have been transformed, setting the template for how much finance was needed to compete at the top end of the Premier League. In total, Abramovich has loaned the club more than Â£1.5bn, which has helped to bring great success. Under his ownership, the club have won every major trophy possible - including the Champions League twice, both the Premier League and FA Cup five times, the Europa League twice and the League Cup three times. In August 2021, they won the Uefa Super Cup and in February won their first Club World Cup. He has appointed 13 different managers and the club spent more than Â£2bn in the transfer market under his ownership. Chelsea's women's team, who became affiliated to Chelsea FC in 2004, have thrived under Abramovich's ownership, winning the Women's Super League four times, the Women's FA Cup, three times and reaching the Champions League final last season. Their high profile has seen world stars such as Australia's Sam Kerr and Danish forward Pernille Harder move to the club. This video can not be played 'It's his choice, it's his club' - Tuchel on Abramovich's Chelsea sale Other Russian billionaires have already been the subject of European Union sanctions where their assets have been frozen. That has included Russian billionaire Alisher Usmanov, who has commercial links to Everton. The United Kingdom government is yet to sanction Abramovich or Usmanov, but Labour MP Chris Bryant said in Parliament on Tuesday that Abramovich was ""terrified of being sanctioned which is why he is going to sell his home tomorrow [Wednesday], and another flat as well"". On Wednesday, during Prime Minister's Questions, Labour leader Keir Starmer asked why Abramovichwas not facing sanctions,with Boris Johnson replying it was ""not appropriate to comment on any individual cases at this stage"". A spokesperson denied the Labour leader's claims and said Abramovich had not done anything sanctionable. Wyss also said: ""Abramovich is trying to sell all of his villas in England, he also wants to get rid of Chelsea quickly. ""I and three other people received an offer on Tuesday to buy Chelsea from Abramovich."" A spokesperson for Abramovich declined to comment on those claims. Dan Roan, BBC sport editor While this was not an entirely unexpected development after it became apparent during the last 24 hours that Roman Abramovich was looking to sell Chelsea, this dramatic announcement still feels like a seismic moment. Not only for the west London club, but for the wider English game too. The Russian billionaire's arrival almost two decades ago helped transform the Premier League's competitive balance, profile and spending power, reinforcing its status as a truly global competition. The oligarch's riches turned Chelsea into a major force in the game, and his ownership seemed to pave the way for subsequent takeovers by overseas billionaires, at clubs like Manchester City for instance. But there was significant controversy too. With Abramovich - one of Russia's richest people - almost never commenting in public, he also came to symbolise the detachment of some super-wealthy club owners. Many also found the ruthlessness with which he treated managers questionable. There was always intrigue surrounding the motives for his ownership, and how he made his fortune. While he has always denied direct links with Putin, the invasion of Ukraine led to calls in parliament for the government to sanction wealthy Russians. Abramovich vehemently denies that he had done anything to merit sanctions being imposed against him. But as the highest-profile oligarch in the country, and withone MP citing concerns about alleged links to corruption,his ownership was coming under mounting scrutiny. And with the government facing mounting pressure to seize his assets, and Abramovich criticised over his failure to explicitly condemn Russia's invasion, it is little surprise that he has swiftly announced his decision to sell. In recent years Abramovich has been an increasingly infrequent visitor to Stamford Bridge, withdrawing his application for a visa in 2018 after relations between the UK and Russia worsened. But while fans had got used to not seeing Abramovich, the Russian's departure could mean the club is run very differently in future - and perhaps with much more financial constraint - by whoever now buys it. That may help explain why some at Chelsea will no doubt be sorry to see him go. Many other observers, however, will be pleased, some of whom have always viewed Abramovich's ownership as a classic example of 'sportswashing'. Having always insisted he was passionate about the club and had its interests at heart, he leaves as one of the most significant, controversial and influential figures in the history of English football. This video can not be played Chelsea manager Thomas Tuchel voices frustration over Roman Abramovich questions Football finance expert Kieran Maguire Chelsea will be a desirable football club for many given its status within the game. It's in London which makes it very attractive to ultra high net-worth individuals. You have to caution that Chelsea has lost more money than any other club in the history of the Premier League and its stadium is a lot smaller than some of the other stadiums in London. Speaking to some agents already today, I think the initial asking price is around Â£3bn. I think that is unlikely to be achieved. But if you are looking for a trophy asset - something to show off to your compatriots, to your friends, then Chelsea has an awful lot of attraction. They are European and world champions - that does add to its allure. There are three potential types of bidders we could see. We could see the individual billionaire looking to add to their portfolio of well-known assets. It could come for a private equity company based in the US who believes the riches of Premier League are undervalued in traditional markets. We could see from a sovereign wealth fund as we've seen in relation to Manchester City, Newcastle and Paris St-Germain This sale has come at a bad time in terms of the market. The share price of Manchester United - a good peer group company for Chelsea - is now trading significantly below its initial listing price in 2012. The market seems to have lost its love-in with football and this could impact on the ultimate price Chelsea is sold for. 24 February:Russian President Vladimir Putin launches a military invasion of Ukraine. 25 February:Labour's Chris Bryant tells MPs the UK government should removeRoman Abramovich's ownership of Chelseaand seize his assets, citing concerns about alleged links to corruption. 26 February:Abramovich announces he is handing""stewardship and care""of Chelsea to its charitable foundation. 27 February:Foundation membersexpress concernover whether Charity Commission rules would allow them to run the club.

Biden to Putin: You have no idea what's coming,"This video can not be played Watch: Standing ovation for Ukrainian ambassador at Biden speech US President Joe Biden has told Congress that Vladimir Putin badly misjudged how the West would hit back once he invaded Ukraine. In a primetime speech, Mr Biden vowed ""an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny"". Democrats and Republicans reacted to Mr Biden's appeal to show support for Ukraine by rising in unison to applaud. His State of the Union address came as pandemic-weary Americans grapple with galloping inflation. In an hour-long address to lawmakers on Tuesday night, the Democratic president said: ""Putin's war was premeditated and unprovoked. He rejected repeated efforts at diplomacy. ""He thought the West and Nato wouldn't respond. And he thought he could divide us here at home."" Mr Biden - whose chaotic withdrawal last year from Afghanistan damaged his popularity among Americans - added: ""Putin was wrong. We were ready."" He announced that the US would ban Russian aircraft from American airspace, following similar bans by Canadian and European authorities. What message was Biden sending to Putin? Follow live updates from the ground Why Biden won't send troops to Ukraine The US and its allies have launched a barrage of sanctions against Russia's economy and financial system and Mr Putin himself. In his speech Mr Biden deviated from his prepared remarks by vowing further economic retaliation, warning Mr Putin: ""He has no idea what's coming."" The US president also welcomed Ukrainian Ambassador Oksana Markarova, who received a standing ovation as she sat in US First Lady Jill Biden's VIP box. THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine? RUSSIA SANCTIONS:'If I could leave, I would' UKRAINE:Desperate scenes in Lviv train station IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict Hours before his address, Mr Biden spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss what help the US could give his country after six days of the Russian assault. ""Let each of us... stand and send an unmistakable signal to Ukraine and to the world,"" Mr Biden told his audience in the chamber of the House of Representatives. It was one of the few moments in the speech where members of both deeply polarised parties rose together to clap and cheer for Ukraine, many of them waving Ukrainian flags that had been passed out before the president arrived. Mr Biden's first formal State of the Union speech, an annual event pushing a president's agenda, came as his approval rating languishes. Just 40.6% of Americans are happy with his job performance, according to the RealClearPolitics polling average. After addressing his biggest foreign policy crisis, the invasion of Ukraine, Mr Biden confronted a host of domestic troubles dogging his presidency, from the enduring pandemic, to soaring consumer prices, to a wave of violent crime. Ukraine flags and badges were in evidence Although the US jobless rate has sunk to 4%, inflation has hit a 40-year high. The president sought on Tuesday night to empathise with hard-pressed working families, saying: ""I get it."" He promised a plan for ""building a better America"". Mr Biden argued the best way to counter rocketing consumer prices was to boost domestic production of cars and semiconductors and rebuild the nation's roads and bridges. Opinion polls show Americans are also unhappy with Mr Biden's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. But on Tuesday, members of Congress who attended the speech were not required to wear masks for the first time in months. Mr Biden said: ""Last year Covid-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again.""Â Biden's first year in office - in six charts Five voters give their verdict on Biden More than 2,000 Americans are still dying daily of Covid, according to the latest figures, the highest official tally of any country in the world. With the nation's homicide rate having hit a 25-year high, Mr Biden rejected calls to defund the police that were taken up by a wide spectrum of his fellow Democrats. ""The answer is not to defund the police,"" said the president.Â ""The answer is to fund them."" Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds delivered the Republican response to Mr Biden's speech. She sought to portray a presidency that had sent America back to the late '70s ""when runaway inflation was hammering families, a violent crime wave was crashing on our cities, and the Soviet army was trying to redraw the world map"".

Russian forces claim control of key port city,"Emergency services in the aftermath of a strike on a TV tower in Kyiv on Tuesday that killed five The key Ukrainian port city of Mariupol was ""near to a humanitarian catastrophe"" on Wednesday after more than 15 hours of continuous bombardment by Russian forces, the city's deputy mayor told the BBC. ""The Russian army is working through all their weapons here - artillery, multiple rocket launch systems, airplanes, tactical rockets. They are trying to destroy the city,"" Serhiy Orlov said. Mr Orlov said Russian forces were several kilometres from the city on all sides and had launched strikes on key infrastructure, cutting water and power supplies to parts of the city. One densely populated residential district on the city's left bank had been ""nearly totally destroyed"", he said. ""We cannot count the number of victims there, but we believe at least hundreds of people are dead. We cannot go in to retrieve the bodies. My father lives there, I cannot reach him, I don't know if he is alive or dead."" Russian forces had targeted strikes against pump stations and electrical transformers, Mr Orlov said, and there were food shortages in parts of the city - raising fears of an approaching humanitarian crisis. Mariupol is a key strategic target for Russia because seizing it would allow Russian-backed separatist forces in eastern Ukraine to join forces with troops in Crimea, the southern peninsula annexed by Russia in 2014. Ukraine's army has resisted Russian forces so far in key parts of the country but the increased aerial bombardment of cities has raised fears Russia is shifting tactics. ""The Ukrainian army is very brave and they will continue to defend the city but the style of the Russian army is like pirates - they do not fight with their army, they just destroy entire districts,"" Mr Orlov said. ""We believe in our Ukrainian army, but we are in a terrible situation."" Russia's invasion of Ukraine took a heavy toll on civilians on Wednesday as residential neighbourhoods in several large cities were bombed. Ukraine's emergency services said more than 2,000 civilians had been killed so far during the Russian invasion, though the BBC was not able to independently verify the figure. The UN said on Tuesday that at least 136 civilians had been killed, but it estimated that the actual number was higher. There were fears on Wednesday that the death toll would rise dramatically as Russian troops appeared to surround the country's second-largest city, Kharkiv, and the port city of Kherson. Ukrainian forces said Russian paratroopers had landed near Kharkiv on Wednesday, leading to street fighting on the outskirts of the city. Local officials said a cruise missile hit a city council meeting, blowing off the top of the building and wounding three. At least 18 people have been reported killed in the city in the past day. A fire at the a Kharkiv university building after it was hit by a Russian missile on Wednesday Residents in Kharkiv told the BBC they were experiencing heavy aerial bombardment. ""It is exhausting and terrifying living under this pressure,"" said Iryna Ruzhynska, 40, who was sheltering with her family in her second-floor apartment on Wednesday. ""We have put Scotch tape on the windows and pillows by the window stills,"" Ms Ruzhynska said. ""We don't turn on the lights, only the torches on our phones. We managed to go to the store yesterday, but we queued for four hours and there was virtually no food left."" The Russian defence ministry claimed its forces were in control of Kherson, a city of nearly 250,000 people just north of Crimea, but local authorities said the city was still under Ukrainian control, despite being surrounded. Video footage verified by the BBC appeared to show Russian troops in the centre of Kherson. LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine? RUSSIA SANCTIONS:'If I could leave, I would' UKRAINE:Desperate scenes in Lviv train station IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict Larysa Pavlovska, a 58-year-old paramedic in Kherson, told the BBC her part of the city was quiet on Wednesday but other parts were smouldering after intense overnight shelling, adding that some residential districts had been ""bombed out"". ""Local residents say Russian armoured vehicles can be seen moving in the city, people say about 50 units,"" she said. ""They have been spotted by the state regional administration building."" Inesa Chamlai, the deputy head of the emergency aid centre in Kherson, said Russian troops had prevented them taking a wounded 55-year-old man to hospital. The man had stepped on a mine and lost his leg, Mr Chamlai said. ""Our ambulance team was dispatched but was then prevented by Russian troops from taking the man to hospital,"" he said. ""The soldiers ordered to bring him back to his house where he will definitely die."" There were also growing fears in the capital, Kyiv, over a 40-mile long convoy of Russian military vehicles just 15 miles north of the city, though US officials said on Wednesday the column was barely moving. In Irpin, close to Kyiv, residential buildings have been destroyed Russia's air force struck a television mast in the capital on Tuesday, killing five people at the site of a Nazi massacre which killed more than 33,000, mostly Jews, while a missile strike west of Kyiv, in the city of Zhytomyr, killed four people including a child, a Ukrainian official said. In a video message on Wednesday, Ukraine's president Volodymyr Zelensky, who is Jewish, condemned the strike at the site of the massacre, accusing the Russians of trying to ""erase"" Ukrainians. ""They know nothing about our capital. About our history. But they have an order to erase our history. Erase our country. Erase us all,"" he said. A UK government spokesperson said Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke to Mr Zelensky on Wednesday ""to condemn the abhorrent attacks on Ukraine in the recent hours and days"". In an address on Tuesday, the US president Joe Biden called Russian President Vladimir Putin a ""dictator"" and promised ""robust action to make sure the pain of our sanctions is targeted at Russia's economy"". Nearly a week after invading, Russia is facing increasing economic turmoil at home as it is hit by increasing sanctions. The Moscow Stock Exchange remained closed for the third day in a row on Wednesday as authorities tried to limit the impact of the sanctions. ""The Russian economy has suffered a serious blow,"" Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said, insisting that it was ""still standing"". Have you been affected by any of the issues raised here?

"Russia's Kharkiv attacks are war crimes - ZelenskyThe Ukrainian president asks the EU to prove it is with his country, while accusing Russia of terrorism.","This video can not be played Watch: The moment Kyiv TV tower was struck by a Russian missile Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has accused Russia of war crimes after it launched air strikes on the country's second city, Kharkiv. At least 10 people were killed and 35 hurt when an opera house, a concert hall and government offices were struck in Kharkiv's Freedom Square on Tuesday. Later, Ukraine's military said Russian troops had parachuted into Kharkiv in an effort to capture the besieged city. The military said there were immediate clashes after the paratroopers landed. Earlier on Tuesday, the main TV tower in the capital Kyiv was also hit, knocking media off air and killing five people. Moscow warned residents near Kyiv's military areas to leave their homes. The explosion sent smoke billowing from the steel structure, but the tower remains standing. A nearby memorial to victims of the Holocaust was damaged in the same strike. The Babyn Yar ravine is Europe's largest mass grave of the Holocaust where more than 70,000 people, mostly Jews, were shot by the Nazis. Mr Zelensky said on Twitter,externalthat the attack was ""history repeating..."". ""What is the point of saying 'never again' for 80 years, if the world stays silent when a bomb drops on the same site of Babyn Yar?"" Satellite images reveal a huge Russian military convoy snaking towards Kyiv, amid fears of an all-out assault on the capital. But a senior US defence official said there had been ""no appreciable movement"" by the 40-mile (64km) convoy on Tuesday. There were indications that morale was flagging among Russian troops in general, and some units were surrendering, sometimes without a fight, the official added.

Later the parliament said it would look at a request by Ukraine for candidate status of the EU. The Ukrainian president condemned the attacks on Kharkiv as ""state terrorism on the part of Russia"". Video footage showed a missile hitting the local government building and exploding, causing a massive fireball and blowing out windows of surrounding buildings. Freedom Square is the second largest city-centre square in Europe and a landmark of the city. Residents of Kharkiv told the BBC they were living in ""hell"" because of apparent attacks on civilians. Yulia, a married mother of three, said the Russians were targeting areas with no military infrastructure. ""They've been bombing... a residential area where tens of thousands of people live - mothers, children,"" she said. ""We have very many injured... This is hell."" Another resident told the Newshour programme she and her husband and children were living in a bomb shelter because they did not know where the shelling would strike next. Joel Gunter, BBC News, Ukraine Just 30 miles from the border and largely Russian speaking, Kharkiv has long been considered an obvious target for this invasion. Russian troops have engaged in street combat there with Ukrainian soldiers defending the city, and the city has been heavily bombarded from the air, killing scores of civilians at least. Residents who spoke to the BBC on Tuesday described spending long nights in cramped bomb shelters or, for those with no access underground, in the hallways of their apartments, away from windows. Iryna Ruzhynska, 40, was sheltering on Tuesday in the hallway of her second-floor apartment in a 16-floor building, with her two sons, daughter-in-law and grandchild. Ruzhynska's mother, who is 75, was trapped in her own 11th-floor apartment because the building's lift was out of order. ""We have put scotch tape on the windows and pillows by the window stills,"" Ruzhynska said. ""We don't turn on the lights, only the torches on our phones. We managed to go to the store yesterday, but we queued for four hours and there was virtually no food left."" A street nearby Ruzhynska's apartment was shelled on Monday, she said - a thumping blast that left body parts strewn around the street. When she opens her window she can hear gunfire and bombing. ""It is exhausting and terrifying living under this pressure,"" she said. ""And I am angry, because this is a big, beautiful city, my city, and they want to wipe it from the face of the Earth.""

Russia's defence ministry said it was not targeting cities, only military infrastructure, and that there was no threat to the civilian population. The sixth day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine saw continued attacks on several fronts, but the Russian advance has reportedly been slowed by Ukrainian resistance. There are reports of shelling and street fighting in the southern city ofKherson, andMariupol, a port city also in the south of Ukraine, is without electricity after an intense bombardment. Four people, including a child, were killed when their homes were struck inZhytomyron Tuesday by a Russian air strike, apparently aimed at a nearby military base, a Ukrainian official said. More than 600,000 people across Ukraine have fled their homesto escape the fighting, according to the United Nations, and Kyiv says more than 350 civilians, including 13 children, have been killed in Ukraine since the invasion began. Ukraine has also reported that more than 70 of its soldiers have been killed, while Russia has not released figures for its own losses, amid Ukrainian claims of thousands of deaths.

How many nuclear weapons does Russia have?,"US President Joe Biden has warned that the risk of a nuclear ""Armageddon"" is at its highest level for 60 years. Mr Biden said that Russian President Vladimir Putin was ""not joking"" when he warned that Moscow would use ""all means we have"" to defend Russian territory. Mr Putin has also said that the US created a ""precedent"" by using nuclear weapons in World War Two. But analysts suggest Mr Putin's words should probably be interpreted as a warning to other countries not to escalate their involvement in Ukraine, rather than signalling any desire to use nuclear weapons. Nuclear weapons have existed for almost 80 years and many countries see them as a deterrent that continues to guarantee their national security. All figures for nuclear weapons are estimates but, according to the Federation of American Scientists, Russia has 5,977 nuclear warheads - the devices that trigger a nuclear explosion - though this includes about 1,500 that are retired and set to to be dismantled. Of the remaining 4,500 or so, most are considered strategic nuclear weapons - ballistic missiles, or rockets, which can be targeted over long distances. These are the weapons usually associated with nuclear war. The rest are smaller, less destructive nuclear weapons for short-range use on battlefields or at sea. But this does not mean Russia has thousands of long-range nuclear weapons ready to go. Experts estimate around 1,500 Russian warheads are currently ""deployed"", meaning sited at missile and bomber bases or on submarines at sea. Nine countries have nuclear weapons: China, France, India, Israel, North Korea, Pakistan, Russia, the US and the UK. China, France, Russia, the US and the UK are also among 191 states signed up to the Treaty on the Non-Proliferation of Nuclear Weapons (NPT). Under the agreement, they have to reduce their stockpile of nuclear warheads and, in theory, are committed to their complete elimination. And it has reduced the number of warheads stored in those countries since the 1970 and 80s. India, Israel and Pakistan never joined the NPT - and North Korea left in 2003. Israel is the only country of the nine never to have formally acknowledged its nuclear programme - but it is widely accepted to have nuclear warheads. Ukraine has no nuclear weapons and, despite accusations by President Putin, there is no evidence it has attempted to acquire them. IN-DEPTH:Biden says nuclear risk highest for 60 years ANALYSIS:Putin's dream of victory slipping away ON THE GROUND:Ukraine war in maps READ MORE:Full coverage of the crisis,external Nuclear weapons are designed to cause maximum devastation. The extent of the destruction depends on a range of factors, including: the size of the warhead how high above the ground it detonates the local environment But even the smallest warhead could cause huge loss of life and lasting consequences. The bomb that killed up to 146,000 people in Hiroshima, Japan, during World War Two, was 15 kilotons. And nuclear warheads today can be more than 1,000 kilotons. Little is expected to survive in the immediate impact zone of a nuclear explosion. After a blinding flash, there is a huge fireball and blast wave that can destroy buildings and structures for several kilometres. The argument for maintaining large numbers of nuclear weapons has been having the capacity to completely destroy your enemy would prevent them from attacking you. The most famous term for this became mutually assured destruction (Mad). Though there have been many nuclear tests and a constant increase in their technical complexity and destructive power, nuclear weapons have not been used in an armed confrontation since 1945. Russian policy also acknowledges nuclear weapons solely as a deterrent and lists four cases for their use: the launch of ballistic missiles attacking the territory of the Russian Federation or its allies the use of nuclear weapons or other types of weapons of mass destruction against the Russian Federation or its allies an attack on critical governmental or military sites of the Russian Federation that threatens its nuclear capability aggression against the Russian Federation with the use of conventional weapons when the very existence of the state is in jeopardy The shadow of nuclear weapons has hung over this conflict from its earliest days - and that has been a deliberate choice on the part of Vladimir Putin. He has raised their use at moments when he has been on the back foot - for instance after the failure of his initial February plan to quickly overthrow the Ukrainian government and now again when a Ukrainian offensive has driven his forces back, His hope will be that a reminder of the devastating power of these weapons will intimidate and deter his opponents and force them to rethink how far they are willing to push. There is also a domestic motive - the Russian population will be worried by the partial mobilisation and Putin's own claims that Nato is somehow threatening Russia itself. Talking about nuclear weapons is a way of reassuring domestic opinion that despite this dark turn, the country remains capable of defending itself. Russian military doctrine says nuclear weapons will only be used if the Russian state itself is threatened. It was notable that Putin framed their use in a defensive sense responding to what he claimed were Western nuclear threats. His reference to this not being a 'bluff' referred to a situation when Russia's territorial integrity was threatened. An important question is how far Russia sees its territory extending after the upcoming referenda in Ukrainian territory. All of this suggests that the use of nuclear weapons is far from imminent or even likely. While the possibility of their use can not be dismissed, especially if Putin feels the security of the state threatened, the response from the West for the moment will likely be to watch closely Russia's actual behaviour rather than the rhetoric and to remain focused on their strategy.

What message did Biden send?,"Joe Biden spent the first 15 minutes of his State of the Union address talking about Russia's invasion of Ukraine, an event that certainly has transfixed the world more than the latest twists and stumbles of his domestic legislative agenda. Although Mr Biden's annual speech is billed as a message to Congress, his comments on Ukraine were tailored to four distinct audiences - with four distinct messages. Here's a look at what he had to say and to whom. Latest updates from Ukraine Early in his speech, Mr Biden called out Ukrainian ambassador to the US Oksana Markarova, seated in the balcony next to Jill Biden and other distinguished guests. ""Thank you, thank you, thank you,"" he said, as members of Congress cheered. This video can not be played Watch: Standing ovation for Ukrainian ambassador at Biden speech The United States has already sent Ukraine military, economic and humanitarian aid. On Tuesday night, Mr Biden wanted to send a message that America cared about Ukraine's fate and stood by the embattled nation. ""From President Zelensky to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination inspires the world,"" he said. Although Kyiv may be encircled by Russian tanks, his message was that more American help is on the way. Mr Biden's message to Vladimir Putin was simple - the Russian president had ""badly miscalculated"". The economy pain that the US and Europe had imposed on Russia for its invasion was just beginning. The rouble was crashing, the Russian stock market was in free-fall, Russian oligarchs would have their ""ill-begotten gains"" confiscated, and Russia was losing access to key technologies. There was another message to Russia beyond one of economic pain, however. He also emphasised that the US and its allies would fight to defend ""every inch of territory of Nato countries"". Mr Putin has put his nuclear forces on elevated alert and warned of devastating consequences if any nation intervened in Ukraine. Mr Biden's message was to spell out, lest there be any doubt, when and where America itself would fight. The US and its European allies have been in remarkable lockstep as they imposed sanctions on Russia and offered military aid to Ukraine. Time and time again during his speech, Mr Biden celebrated this fact. ""He thought the West and Nato wouldn't respond,"" the president said. ""Putin was wrong. We were ready."" Biden vows 'freedom will triumph over tyranny' Mr Putin may have got that impression from the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, which sparked criticism directed at Mr Biden for not consulting allies. But this was a topic the US president notably avoided during his speech. Mr Biden's emphasis on the key role Europe has played in the response to Russia's invasion may have been part of this administration's continued effort to soothe frayed relations. Over the course of his presidency, Mr Biden has spoken repeatedly about what he sees as an era-defining global conflict between democracies and autocracies - and that it would take co-operation among the democracies of the world to prevail. It was a theme he touched on again on Tuesday. ""Democracies are rising to the moment,"" he said, ""and the world is clearly choosing the side of peace and security."" THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine? RUSSIA SANCTIONS:'If I could leave, I would' UKRAINE:Desperate scenes in Lviv train station IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict A public opinion survey released earlier on Tuesday showed that a majority of Americans were most interested in hearing what Mr Biden had to say about the conflict in Ukraine. Biden's message was that the global unity of response - from Asia to Latin America to Europe and even Switzerland - was a testament to his administration's efforts. ""American diplomacy matters,"" he said. ""American resolve matters."" One of Mr Biden's campaign pledges was to restore US standing in the world and rebuild strained relations with allies after the tumultuous Trump years. This, he implied, were tangible results of that effort, coming when the stakes were at their highest. Mr Biden also had a message to Americans we may be concerned that the possibility that US soldiers would be at risk in the Ukrainian conflict. While he spelled out US obligations to Nato allies, his message about what the US would do in Ukraine was also direct, that US forces ""are not engaged and will not engage in conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine"". Why Biden won't send troops to Ukraine Finally, Mr Biden had to address what is sure to be the increased economic hardship that Americans will bear because of the conflict in Ukraine - hardships added to those already caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and ones that may come at political price for a president whose standing with the US public is already weak. He said that the US will attempt to craft its sanctions to target the Russian economy, but that costs for the rest of the world were unavoidable. He announced that the US will release 30 million barrels of oil from its strategic reserve, but that move is more symbolic than it is likely to blunt the rising price of gas for American consumers. ""I know the news about what's happening can seem alarming,"" he said, ""but I want you to know that we are going to be OK."" That may be the most important message for Mr Biden's political fortunes. If the American public doesn't feel OK, the president and his party may bear the consequences in November's mid-term elections.

Oil and gas surge sparks fears over new bill rises,"Russian oil makes up around 8% of global supply The cost of oil surged on Wednesday, as traders snapped up non-Russian oil, increasing the chance of further price rises at UK forecourts. Brent crude - the global benchmark for oil prices - passed $113 a barrel, its highest level since June 2014. Traders are struggling to sell Russian oil, even at a discount, because of the new difficulties in shipping and payments amid its invasion of Ukraine. Gas prices also doubled, which could feed through to energy bills. Almost 70% of Russian crude oil exports do not have a buyer according to UK-based research consultancy, Energy Aspects. On Tuesday, oil trader Trafigura offered a cargo load of Russian crude oil at a record discount of $18.60 per barrel below the market rate for Brent, but could not find a buyer willing to take the risk. Amrita Sen, its founding partner told the BBC World Service that buyers are concerned that they could run afoul of Western sanctions and ""lawyers are poring through the language"" of the new rules. The RAC said if the higher oil price is sustained, the cost of filling up a car in the UK will increase with it. ""The sudden $10 jump in the oil price is likely to take the average price of petrol towards 155p a litre and diesel to 160p, particularly as it's looking like this price isn't just a market blip caused by the US and allies deciding to dip into the strategic oil reserve. ""If oil does stay at this level, the journey to an average unleaded price of 155p may be far too quick."" said RAC fuel spokesperson Simon Williams. The average price of petrol across UK forecourts on Tuesday was 151.6p per litre, according to the RAC. Household gas and electricity bills are set to rise after the annual energy price cap increases to Â£1,971 in April, but the rise in wholesale prices amid the war in Ukraine may mean the price cap ratchets up to Â£3,000 by the end of the year, according to one energy analyst. ""Wholesale prices make up between 40-50% of household bills,"" said independent energy analyst David Cox. ""If these high prices stay around 400p per therm we may see the price cap head closer to Â£3,000 per year, which is terrifying."" Energy analysts at Cornwall Insights also predicted a jump in the energy price cap in October, based on turmoil in the European wholesale gas prices, to over Â£2,900. Higher oil and commodity prices helped the London stock market to buck the downward trend in global markets, with commodity-linked company share prices surging as the Ukraine crisis fanned fears about supply shortages. The FTSE 100 closed up 1.36%, boosted by Shell and BP shares. On Wall Street, the Dow Jones, Nasdaq and S&P 500 indexes all opened trading higher, and were up between 1.6% and 1.9% respectively at the close of trade. Meanwhile, the price of US oil - West Texas Intermediate crude - rose to almost $109.78 a barrel. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Major movie studios halt Russia film releases Ukraine to sell 'war bonds' to fund armed forces Jaguar Land Rover pauses car sales to Russia Oil and gas is still flowing from Russia - but there's deep concern that situation may change - either because of a further tightening of sanctions, or because Russia itself decides to restrict supplies. So prices are rising. The decision by International Energy Agency members to release 60m barrels of emergency oil reserves has done little to calm the situation. If anything, comments by the head of the agency that global energy security is under threat have made traders even more nervous. Meanwhile wholesale gas prices in the UK and Europe have moved perilously close to the record levels seen in December. Europe gets 40% of its gas from Russia and there are deep concerns about what would happen if those supplies were choked off. At the moment, the high prices are working in Russia's favour - it's making billions at a time when it's economy is being squeezed. While that makes it unlikely Moscow will cut supplies, nothing can be ruled out. If European nations were to clamp down on oil or gas imports, meanwhile, the impact of its sanctions would be magnified dramatically. But it would also cause serious economic pain for those countries themselves. The IEA member countries, led by the United States, yesterday agreed to release 60 million barrels of emergency stockpiles, but it appeared to have had a limited effect on pricing. Selling the emergency oil reserves is not sufficient to meet the supply shortfall caused by Russia's invasion of Ukraine or prevent prices from going higher, analysts at Goldman Sachs said. AJ Bell investment director Russ Mould said the move would not ""make any sustained difference"" to prices. ""Russia controls a sixth of the world's gas and a tenth of its oil. Those figures dwarf the 60 million barrels and industrial buyers, or financial speculators, will be focusing on those numbers and where that supply goes. ""The West is still buying Russian supply and Russia is still providing it but that could conceivably change as relations deteriorate further,"" Mr Mould added. Russian oil exports account for about 8% of global supply. The Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), Russia and allies, a group known as known as OPEC+, met and agreed on Wednesday to stick to their ongoing policy of increasing supply by 400,000 barrels per day in April. ExxonMobil on Tuesday said it would sell out its stakes in Russian oil and gas operations as a result of Moscow's invasion of Ukraine. Shell and BP have also made similar announcements.

Russian ultimatum over UK satellite launch,"Mr Rogozinâs comments followed the Soyuz rocketâs early morning transfer to the launch pad The UK has rejected Russian demands for it to sell its share in internet firm OneWeb to allow a satellite launch. A Soyuz rocket carrying 36 OneWeb satellites is on the launch pad at Baikonur Cosmodrome in Kazakhstan. Russia's space agency Roscomos demanded guarantees the spacecraft would not be used for military purposes. It then said it would not launch the rocket unless the UK sold its share in OneWeb - but business secretary Kwasi Kwarteng rejected this. ""There's no negotiation on OneWeb: the UK government is not selling its share,""tweeted Mr Kwarteng,external. Stop rocket launch from Russian site, UK urged What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? UK space start-up gets $500m cash injection The UK government, which hascome under pressure to pull the launchbecause of the war in Ukraine in any case, said it was continuing to discuss the situation with its partners on the OneWeb board. OneWeb itself has made few public comments in recent days, although the BBC understands this was because it wanted the space to remove its personnel from the Baikonur launch complex. This it has now done. UK taxpayers helped buy OneWeb out of bankruptcy in 2020 with a Â£400m stake. In an interview with Russia 24 TV channel, Roscosmos head Dmitry Rogozin said the agency had contacted OneWeb and its partner Arianespace to demand ""comprehensive legally binding guarantees"" that the satellites would not be used for military purposes. ""If by 21:30 on March 4 we do not receive confirmation, the rocket will be removed from the launch pad and the satellites will be sent to the assembly and test building,"" he added. The launch is currently timed for 22:41 GMT on Friday (03:41 local, Saturday). Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

You may want to readTwitterâs cookie policy,externalandprivacy policy,externalbefore accepting. To view this content chooseâaccept and continueâ. Mr Rogozin posted a video of pad workers covering over UK, US and Japanese flags According to Russian news agency TASS, Mr Rogozin said the OneWeb contract had been paid in full and the funds would not be returned. ""We received all the money for it for the manufacture of launch vehicles, upper-stages and for the necessary launch services. ""This money, due to force majeure circumstances that have arisen as a result of the aggressive policy of the West and the sanctions that are applied against Russia, this money will remain in Russia,"" the Roscosmos boss stated. The space agency's twitter feed later went a step further, demanding the ""hostile"" UK government withdraw its shareholding from the London-headquartered company. Mr Rogozin posted a video showing pad workers at Baikonur covering over the flags of the UK, US and Japan from the fairing of Friday's rocket. Neither OneWeb nor the UK government will be taking direction from Mr Rogozin. His demands are impossible. The UK and US militaries want to use OneWeb, and ever since British taxpayers took a share in the company post-bankruptcy the talk has been about adding further defence and security capabilities to future OneWeb satellites. Low-Earth orbiting broadband internet constellations present an emerging challenge for authoritarian regimes. While they can simply turn off terrestrial networks to control the flow of information, this is much harder to achieve with space infrastructure. The numbers of satellites in these new constellations, and the speed at which they move across the sky, make them hard to jam. US entrepreneur Elon Musk this weekshipped antenna terminals to Ukraineto allow citizens there to use his Starlink broadband system. At the moment, most of Ukraine would not be able to plug into OneWeb because much of the country is too far south for its signals. Future launches planned by OneWeb would ultimately though have filled in this gap. Former UK government adviser Dominic Cummings, widely regarded as the official who persuaded Prime Minister Boris Johnson to buy into OneWeb,tweeted at the weekend,externalthat a situation such as that in Ukraine was in their minds when making the investment. OneWeb has just a handful of launches left to complete its network of 648 satellites. All of the missions are booked on Russian Soyuz vehicles that are scheduled to fly out of Baikonur in the coming months. With the existing spacecraft it has in orbit (428), the company can deliver broadband internet connections to locations above 50 degrees North, which includes business customers such as BT in the UK, but it needs those additional satellites if it wants to run a truly global service. Regions important to the company's prospects, including the rest of Europe, most of the US, Africa and Asia, will be left out without the final set of launches. What happens next is anyone's guess, but a flight to orbit on Friday now seems highly unlikely. OneWeb's launch contract is with France-based Arianespace. It markets Soyuz vehicles to the world. Following itsemergence from Chapter 11 bankruptcy in 2020, OneWeb paid Arianespace upfront to organise all its launches. Then there is the issue of the 36 satellites currently sitting on top of the Soyuz in Baikonur. They are the property of OneWeb. They were manufactured in Florida in the US and their handling is therefore subject to strict American export controls covering sensitive technologies. These regulations would have seen the satellites' shipment to Kazakhstan and attachment to the Soyuz rocket overseen by a US official. That official is also no longer present at the spaceport.

Apple to halt sales and limit services in Russia,"Re:Store shops, which sell Apple products in Russia, have been closed. Apple has become the latest major firm to halt all product sales in Russia, in a widening corporate backlash to the country's invasion of Ukraine. The tech giant was said it was ""deeply concerned"" about the Russian invasion and stands with those ""suffering as a result of the violence"". Apple Pay and other services such as Apple Maps have also been limited. Nike did not comment on the conflict but customers are no longer able to order its products online. An automated message said Nike was halting online orders because it could not guarantee delivery of goods to customers in Russia. However, the website directed customers to their nearest Nike stores. One Ukrainian member of parliament, Lesia Vsylenko,tweeted,externalthat the sportswear giant's move was a great example of how private companies could impose sanctions against Russia. Russians can no longer order Nike products online A series of high profile brands have pulled back from Russia in recent days, including film studios, carmakers and technology firms. Google has removed Russian state-funded publishers such as RT from its features. Mobile banking apps in Russian, such as Russia's VTB Bank's app, may soon not function fully on devices using Apple's iOS operating system, according to news agency RIA. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? What is Swift and why is banning Russia so significant? Apple said in a statement that the firm had disabled both traffic and live incidents in Apple Maps in Ukraine as a ""safety and precautionary measure for Ukrainian citizens"". Last week, Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov published an open letter to Apple on Twitter, in which he asked Apple to cut Russia off from its products, services, and App Store.

Apple's iPhones are the third best-selling smartphone in Russia, supplying about 13% of all the handsets sold last year,according to market research firm Counterpoint,external.However that represents less than 2% of Apple's global iPhone sales. Earlier, Google restricted news firms funded by the Russian government from advertising tools and some features on YouTube. ""We are committed to complying with all sanctions requirements and we continue to monitor the latest guidance,"" the company wrote in a blog post. The company also told the BBC that Google Pay had been limited in the country - for those using sanctioned banks. Google has not, however, blocked Google Pay in Russia. Google also said ""most of our services (like Search, Maps and YouTube) currently remain available in Russia, continuing to provide access to global information and perspectives."" Apple is generally fairly good at keeping its head down when it comes to global affairs. For example, it has faced criticism for not standing up to China over its treatment of Uyghurs. This move then is significant, and unusual, by the iPhone maker. One by one global brands have been moving to distance themselves from Russia - making the country look more and more isolated. But it was by no means certain that Apple would make this move. The company had started to receive criticism for its relative silence on Ukraine. The BBC had reached out to Apple for comment, but had not received a reply until this announcement. There are many phone companies in Russia, and plenty of alternatives to Apple products. People with iPhones will also still be able to use the App Store - the pause in sales will not have a huge immediate impact. But as brands desert Russia, its citizens will begin to notice that products they used to buy, simply aren't available anymore. Meanwhile, the Finnish network equipment maker Nokia said it would stop deliveries to Russia to comply with sanctions imposed on the country following the invasion of Ukraine. On Monday, Netflix also said it had ""no plans"" to add state-run channels to its Russian service. Russian regulations had required it to carry 20 free-to-air news, sports and entertainment channels in the country. The biggest shipping firms in the world, Danish Maersk and Geneva-based MSC, also suspended container shipping to and from the country on Tuesday. The UK has also banned ships from Russia in its updated sanctions. Russia supplies a sixth of the world's commodities so will now be cut off from a significant part of shipping trade. Motorbike firm Harley-Davidson also suspended business and shipments of its bikes to Russia. And US plane manufacturer Boeing Co said on Tuesday it was suspending parts, maintenance and technical support for Russian airlines -  as well as major operations in Moscow after Russia's invasion of Ukraine.

Oil hits $113 a barrel despite emergency measures,"Oil prices have surged despite new measures aimed at calming markets worried by the invasion of Ukraine. Brent crude - the international benchmark for oil prices - has hit $113 a barrel, marking the highest level since June 2014. It rose even after the International Energy Agency's members agreed to release 60 million barrels of oil from emergency stockpiles. Russia is one of the biggest energy producers in the world. As a result, concerns about Russia's invasion of Ukraine have sparked concerns among investors that oil or gas supplies could be affected. Meanwhile, the price of US oil - West Texas Intermediate crude - rose to almost $109 a barrel. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Major movie studios halt Russia film releases Ukraine to sell 'war bonds' to fund armed forces Jaguar Land Rover pauses car sales to Russia The United States and 30 other member countries of the International Energy Agency (IEA) agreed to release the oil in a bid to stabilize energy markets worldwide. ""We are prepared to use every tool available to us to limit disruption to global energy supply as a result of President Vladimir Putin's actions,"" White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said on Tuesday. She added that Washington would carry on looking at how to speed up moving energy supplies away from Russia. Another statement by the IEA noted that the invasion of Ukraine came against a ""backdrop of already tight global oil markets, heightened price volatility, commercial inventories that are at their lowest level since 2014"". Petrol price movements in the UK are mainly determined by the price of crude oil, which is the raw material for fuel, and the exchange rate between the dollar and the pound, because oil is traded in dollars. On Monday, the RAC said the average price of petrol had jumped to a record high of Â£1.51 a litre on Sunday, while diesel increased to Â£1.55. Jay Hatfield, chief investment officer at ICAP, said the ""dramatic"" price increases seen globally were unlikely to persist though if the situation in Ukraine becomes more stable. Share prices across Europe and the US also fell further on Tuesday as attacks on cities in Ukraine continued. Markets in US, Europe and UK fell amid fears about the impact of the ongoing conflict. Having been up in early trading, the FTSE 100 turned negative amid the warnings of the consequences of Western sanctions on Moscow and signs that Russia was stepping up its invasion of Ukraine. Western countries have imposed punishing sanctions against Moscow, with another raft of companies winding down Russian operations and halting investment, such as BP and Shell. Italian energy giant Eni also said it planned to sell its stake in the Blue Stream pipeline. Eni co-owns the pipeline, which carries Russian gas to Turkey, with Russian energy firm Gazprom. Meanwhile, French oil and gas group TotalEnergies said it would no longer provide capital for new projects in Russia on Tuesday. Frankfurt saw steeper losses, which analysts suggested could be linked to Germany's reliance on Russian energy imports. Russia's currency was stable, however, having collapsed 30% on Monday to record lows against major currencies. One rouble was worth less than one US cent in trading on Tuesday. The rouble's fall cuts its buying power and hits savings of ordinary Russians. The decline was only halted when Russia's central bank doubled interest rates to make the currency more attractive to investors. The sanctions' stranglehold on Moscow's finances has hit the central bank's access to a lot of Russia's huge reserves of money held in the form of foreign currencies. Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""This is a fast-moving situation and investors should be mindful of potential share price volatility in the short to medium term."" Russia's invasion of Ukraine has investors on edge. There is a huge amount of uncertainty about what is likely to happen next, and you can see that in the volatility on markets. Western sanctions on Russia have caused turmoil in the global banking sector, with firms scrambling to ensure they're not doing business with any sanctioned individual or company. European and US asset managers who are keen to offload their Russian investments may find it difficult to do so with the Moscow stock exchange currently closed and talk that the Kremlin will prevent foreigners from selling up. That - together with the lack of revenue from Russian customers - could mean lower profits for western companies, from energy giants to carmakers to investment funds. Sanctions can hurt both sides, not just the sanctioned. But many company bosses are clear - decisions are being made, not simply about money, but on moral grounds too. Meanwhile, the war continues to unsettle the energy markets, with the price of oil now well over $100 a barrel. An announcement that large stockpiles of crude will be released would ordinarily send prices lower. Today's news, however, has done nothing to ease market concerns about the potential for shortages of oil from Russia. LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine?

Shop prices rise at fastest rate in a decade,"Prices in shops rose at their fastest rate in over a decade in February, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) says. Shop price inflation jumped from 1.5% in January to 1.8% in February, according to the BRC-NielsenIQ price index. It marks the highest rate of inflation it has recorded since November 2011. The sharp rise was partly driven by fresh food price rises and higher prices for other goods such as beauty and furniture products. Many people have been struggling with a cost of living crisis as fuel prices and energy bills continue to soar. The latest official figures provided by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed living costsrising at their highest rate for 30 years. Why are prices rising so quickly? UK wage growth lags rising cost of living What help with bills is there in my council tax band? Non-food inflation rose to 1.3% in February, rising from 0.9% in January which is its highest rate since September 2011, the BRC said on Wednesday. The inflation rate for fresh food, which measures how quickly costs for everyday items increase over time, rose to 3.3% - up from 2.9% in January, according to the industry group. The BRC said this was partly because of poor harvests, both in the UK and overseas. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said that the price rises would be ""unwelcome news"" for households who already face taking how less because of energy price rises and higher National Insurance rates. Retailers, Ms Dickinson added, are still facing cost pressures from higher shipping rates, labour shortages, product price increases and rising energy prices. Many of these increases continue to be passed on to customers. This video can not be played Cost of living: âAll of a sudden thereâs no moneyâ ""Retailers are going to great lengths to mitigate against these price rises and support their customers, for example, many supermarkets have expanded their value ranges for food,"" Ms Dickinson continued. ""Unfortunately, there are limits to the costs that retailers can absorb,"" she added. Mike Watkins, head of retailer and business insight at research firm NielsenIQ, said he expects shop prices to continue to rise over the next few months. ""With falling disposable income for most households, retailers will need to keep encouraging customers to spend by offering choice and value and, for some, discounts as well as added benefits for loyal shoppers,"" Mr Watkins added. The Bank of England has warned the increase in the cost of living could exceed more than 7% this year. Food chains such as Greggs, have already raised the price of some goods in order to cover increased labour costs. The High Street retailer Next, has also said its prices could rise by up to 6% this year to keep up with higher costs. Supermarket giant Tesco has also warned that the ""worst is yet to come"" for rising food prices. Jack Monroe, a food poverty campaigner, has said that the prices of everyday essentials are going up by more than the official inflation rate, hitting the poorest hardest. The ONS agreed that ""one inflation rate doesn't fit all"" and said it would soon be publishing a wider variety of cost-of-living metrics. Why are prices rising in the UK?

"Shop prices rise at fastest rate in a decadeIn February, shop prices rose at their fastest rate in over 10 years, according to one industry group.","Prices in shops rose at their fastest rate in over a decade in February, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) says. Shop price inflation jumped from 1.5% in January to 1.8% in February, according to the BRC-NielsenIQ price index. It marks the highest rate of inflation it has recorded since November 2011. The sharp rise was partly driven by fresh food price rises and higher prices for other goods such as beauty and furniture products. Many people have been struggling with a cost of living crisis as fuel prices and energy bills continue to soar. The latest official figures provided by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed living costsrising at their highest rate for 30 years. Why are prices rising so quickly? UK wage growth lags rising cost of living What help with bills is there in my council tax band? Non-food inflation rose to 1.3% in February, rising from 0.9% in January which is its highest rate since September 2011, the BRC said on Wednesday. The inflation rate for fresh food, which measures how quickly costs for everyday items increase over time, rose to 3.3% - up from 2.9% in January, according to the industry group. The BRC said this was partly because of poor harvests, both in the UK and overseas. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said that the price rises would be ""unwelcome news"" for households who already face taking how less because of energy price rises and higher National Insurance rates. Retailers, Ms Dickinson added, are still facing cost pressures from higher shipping rates, labour shortages, product price increases and rising energy prices. Many of these increases continue to be passed on to customers. This video can not be played Cost of living: âAll of a sudden thereâs no moneyâ ""Retailers are going to great lengths to mitigate against these price rises and support their customers, for example, many supermarkets have expanded their value ranges for food,"" Ms Dickinson continued. ""Unfortunately, there are limits to the costs that retailers can absorb,"" she added. Mike Watkins, head of retailer and business insight at research firm NielsenIQ, said he expects shop prices to continue to rise over the next few months. ""With falling disposable income for most households, retailers will need to keep encouraging customers to spend by offering choice and value and, for some, discounts as well as added benefits for loyal shoppers,"" Mr Watkins added. The Bank of England has warned the increase in the cost of living could exceed more than 7% this year. Food chains such as Greggs, have already raised the price of some goods in order to cover increased labour costs. The High Street retailer Next, has also said its prices could rise by up to 6% this year to keep up with higher costs. Supermarket giant Tesco has also warned that the ""worst is yet to come"" for rising food prices. Jack Monroe, a food poverty campaigner, has said that the prices of everyday essentials are going up by more than the official inflation rate, hitting the poorest hardest. The ONS agreed that ""one inflation rate doesn't fit all"" and said it would soon be publishing a wider variety of cost-of-living metrics. Why are prices rising in the UK?

Council to end contract with Russian-owned firm,"The deal between Suffolk County Council's company Vertas and Gazprom was agreed in 2019 A council plans to stop using gas from Russian company Gazprom as a result of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Suffolk County Council said it would break away from its Â£10m contract with the state-owned energy supplier, held by its wholly owned company Vertas. Council leader Matthew Hicks said the county was ""actively pursuing"" ending the contract. The 2019 deal started in 2020 and is due to run until 2023, theLocal Democracy Reporting Servicesaid.

Oil hits $110 a barrel despite emergency measures,"Oil prices have surged despite new measures aimed at calming markets worried by the invasion of Ukraine. Brent crude - the international benchmark for oil prices - has hit $113 a barrel, marking the highest level since June 2014. It rose even after the International Energy Agency's members agreed to release 60 million barrels of oil from emergency stockpiles. Russia is one of the biggest energy producers in the world. As a result, concerns about Russia's invasion of Ukraine have sparked concerns among investors that oil or gas supplies could be affected. Meanwhile, the price of US oil - West Texas Intermediate crude - rose to almost $109 a barrel. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Major movie studios halt Russia film releases Ukraine to sell 'war bonds' to fund armed forces Jaguar Land Rover pauses car sales to Russia The United States and 30 other member countries of the International Energy Agency (IEA) agreed to release the oil in a bid to stabilize energy markets worldwide. ""We are prepared to use every tool available to us to limit disruption to global energy supply as a result of President Vladimir Putin's actions,"" White House spokeswoman Jen Psaki said on Tuesday. She added that Washington would carry on looking at how to speed up moving energy supplies away from Russia. Another statement by the IEA noted that the invasion of Ukraine came against a ""backdrop of already tight global oil markets, heightened price volatility, commercial inventories that are at their lowest level since 2014"". Petrol price movements in the UK are mainly determined by the price of crude oil, which is the raw material for fuel, and the exchange rate between the dollar and the pound, because oil is traded in dollars. On Monday, the RAC said the average price of petrol had jumped to a record high of Â£1.51 a litre on Sunday, while diesel increased to Â£1.55. Jay Hatfield, chief investment officer at ICAP, said the ""dramatic"" price increases seen globally were unlikely to persist though if the situation in Ukraine becomes more stable. Share prices across Europe and the US also fell further on Tuesday as attacks on cities in Ukraine continued. Markets in US, Europe and UK fell amid fears about the impact of the ongoing conflict. Having been up in early trading, the FTSE 100 turned negative amid the warnings of the consequences of Western sanctions on Moscow and signs that Russia was stepping up its invasion of Ukraine. Western countries have imposed punishing sanctions against Moscow, with another raft of companies winding down Russian operations and halting investment, such as BP and Shell. Italian energy giant Eni also said it planned to sell its stake in the Blue Stream pipeline. Eni co-owns the pipeline, which carries Russian gas to Turkey, with Russian energy firm Gazprom. Meanwhile, French oil and gas group TotalEnergies said it would no longer provide capital for new projects in Russia on Tuesday. Frankfurt saw steeper losses, which analysts suggested could be linked to Germany's reliance on Russian energy imports. Russia's currency was stable, however, having collapsed 30% on Monday to record lows against major currencies. One rouble was worth less than one US cent in trading on Tuesday. The rouble's fall cuts its buying power and hits savings of ordinary Russians. The decline was only halted when Russia's central bank doubled interest rates to make the currency more attractive to investors. The sanctions' stranglehold on Moscow's finances has hit the central bank's access to a lot of Russia's huge reserves of money held in the form of foreign currencies. Sophie Lund-Yates, equity analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said: ""This is a fast-moving situation and investors should be mindful of potential share price volatility in the short to medium term."" Russia's invasion of Ukraine has investors on edge. There is a huge amount of uncertainty about what is likely to happen next, and you can see that in the volatility on markets. Western sanctions on Russia have caused turmoil in the global banking sector, with firms scrambling to ensure they're not doing business with any sanctioned individual or company. European and US asset managers who are keen to offload their Russian investments may find it difficult to do so with the Moscow stock exchange currently closed and talk that the Kremlin will prevent foreigners from selling up. That - together with the lack of revenue from Russian customers - could mean lower profits for western companies, from energy giants to carmakers to investment funds. Sanctions can hurt both sides, not just the sanctioned. But many company bosses are clear - decisions are being made, not simply about money, but on moral grounds too. Meanwhile, the war continues to unsettle the energy markets, with the price of oil now well over $100 a barrel. An announcement that large stockpiles of crude will be released would ordinarily send prices lower. Today's news, however, has done nothing to ease market concerns about the potential for shortages of oil from Russia. LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine?

"UK sanctions Belarus for role in Ukraine invasionThe foreign secretary says Belarus ""actively aids and abets Russiaâs illegal invasion"" of Ukraine.","Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko is a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin The UK has targeted Belarusian army chiefs as part of its first wave of sanctions against Belarus for its role in Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Four defence officials and two military enterprises are included in the package. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko had aided and abetted Russia's invasion. Mr Lukashenko has hosted Russian forces and allowed them to use Belarus as a staging ground. A close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Mr Lukashenko's administration has become increasingly reliant on Russia for economic, political and military support in recent years. Mr Putin backed Mr Lukashenko after he claimed a disputed election victory in 2020, sparking mass protests that almost ousted him from power. Belarus crackdown fails to crush opposition spirit Fear and violence in the jails of Belarus Lukashenko: We may have helped migrants into EU In January this year,Belarus hosted large joint military drills with Russiaas western leaders issued increasingly grave warnings of a possible attack on Ukraine. The exercises were extended and then Belarus announced that the Russian troops would remain in the country, citing ""the aggravation of the situation"" in eastern Ukraine. But on Monday, Mr Lukashenko said Belarus had no plans to join Russia's military operation in Ukraine, according to state news agency Belta. Mr Lukashenko denied Ukraine's allegations that Russian troops were attacking from Belarus's territory, Belta's report said. Announcing sanctions on Tuesday,external, the UK government accused Belarus of ""facilitating the invasion from within its borders"". Those sanctioned include: Belarus's deputy defence minister, Major GeneralVictor Gulevich, who is ""responsible for directing the actions of the Belarusian armed forces"" Major GeneralAndrei Burdyko, a logistics chief; Major GeneralSergei Simonenko, an arms chief; and Major GeneralAndrey Zhuk, Belarus's deputy minister of defence Also sanctioned areJSC Integral, a military semi-conductor manufacturer, andJSC 558 Aircraft Repair Plant, which provides maintenance and servicing to military aircraft at an air base from which Russian aircraft have operated Ms Truss said Belarus ""will be made to feel the economic consequences for its support for Putin"". ""We are inflicting economic pain on Putin and those closest to him. We will not rest until Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity is restored."" The UK says it has already imposed sanctions on more than 100 people and organisations in response to the ""fraudulent elections"" and ""human rights violations"" in Belarus. Suggesting further sanctions could be imposed on Belarus over the Ukraine invasion, the foreign secretary said ""nothing - and no one - is off the table"". Belarusian and Russian forces took part in joint military exercises in Belarus ahead of the invasion of Ukraine Tuesday's Belarus sanctions came as MPs approved new measures against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. The package includes a full asset freeze for all Russian banks, as well as new powers to limit them from clearing payments in sterling. A ban has also been enacted on a range of exports critical to Russia's military and strategic interests. The sanctions are in alignment with the US, European Union and others to collectively cut off much of Russia's high-tech imports, the government said. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Russians feel the pain of international sanctions The measures were announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who told the House of Commons last week they were ""the largest and most severe package of economic sanctions that Russia has ever seen"". Labour and Conservative MPs have called on the government to strengthen the sanctions regime in order to put further pressure on Russia. Labour shadow foreign minister Stephen Doughty urged ministers to ""go even faster and further"", warning in some cases the sanctions had been ""off the pace"" compared with the UK's allies. Conservative former cabinet minister David Davis said action was needed against the ""140 or so oligarchs"" identified as having ""direct links"" with President Putin.

What message was Biden sending to Putin?,"Joe Biden spent the first 15 minutes of his State of the Union address talking about Russia's invasion of Ukraine, an event that certainly has transfixed the world more than the latest twists and stumbles of his domestic legislative agenda. Although Mr Biden's annual speech is billed as a message to Congress, his comments on Ukraine were tailored to four distinct audiences - with four distinct messages. Here's a look at what he had to say and to whom. Latest updates from Ukraine Early in his speech, Mr Biden called out Ukrainian ambassador to the US Oksana Markarova, seated in the balcony next to Jill Biden and other distinguished guests. ""Thank you, thank you, thank you,"" he said, as members of Congress cheered. This video can not be played Watch: Standing ovation for Ukrainian ambassador at Biden speech The United States has already sent Ukraine military, economic and humanitarian aid. On Tuesday night, Mr Biden wanted to send a message that America cared about Ukraine's fate and stood by the embattled nation. ""From President Zelensky to every Ukrainian, their fearlessness, their courage, their determination inspires the world,"" he said. Although Kyiv may be encircled by Russian tanks, his message was that more American help is on the way. Mr Biden's message to Vladimir Putin was simple - the Russian president had ""badly miscalculated"". The economy pain that the US and Europe had imposed on Russia for its invasion was just beginning. The rouble was crashing, the Russian stock market was in free-fall, Russian oligarchs would have their ""ill-begotten gains"" confiscated, and Russia was losing access to key technologies. There was another message to Russia beyond one of economic pain, however. He also emphasised that the US and its allies would fight to defend ""every inch of territory of Nato countries"". Mr Putin has put his nuclear forces on elevated alert and warned of devastating consequences if any nation intervened in Ukraine. Mr Biden's message was to spell out, lest there be any doubt, when and where America itself would fight. The US and its European allies have been in remarkable lockstep as they imposed sanctions on Russia and offered military aid to Ukraine. Time and time again during his speech, Mr Biden celebrated this fact. ""He thought the West and Nato wouldn't respond,"" the president said. ""Putin was wrong. We were ready."" Biden vows 'freedom will triumph over tyranny' Mr Putin may have got that impression from the chaotic withdrawal from Afghanistan, which sparked criticism directed at Mr Biden for not consulting allies. But this was a topic the US president notably avoided during his speech. Mr Biden's emphasis on the key role Europe has played in the response to Russia's invasion may have been part of this administration's continued effort to soothe frayed relations. Over the course of his presidency, Mr Biden has spoken repeatedly about what he sees as an era-defining global conflict between democracies and autocracies - and that it would take co-operation among the democracies of the world to prevail. It was a theme he touched on again on Tuesday. ""Democracies are rising to the moment,"" he said, ""and the world is clearly choosing the side of peace and security."" THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine? RUSSIA SANCTIONS:'If I could leave, I would' UKRAINE:Desperate scenes in Lviv train station IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict A public opinion survey released earlier on Tuesday showed that a majority of Americans were most interested in hearing what Mr Biden had to say about the conflict in Ukraine. Biden's message was that the global unity of response - from Asia to Latin America to Europe and even Switzerland - was a testament to his administration's efforts. ""American diplomacy matters,"" he said. ""American resolve matters."" One of Mr Biden's campaign pledges was to restore US standing in the world and rebuild strained relations with allies after the tumultuous Trump years. This, he implied, were tangible results of that effort, coming when the stakes were at their highest. Mr Biden also had a message to Americans we may be concerned that the possibility that US soldiers would be at risk in the Ukrainian conflict. While he spelled out US obligations to Nato allies, his message about what the US would do in Ukraine was also direct, that US forces ""are not engaged and will not engage in conflict with Russian forces in Ukraine"". Why Biden won't send troops to Ukraine Finally, Mr Biden had to address what is sure to be the increased economic hardship that Americans will bear because of the conflict in Ukraine - hardships added to those already caused by the Covid-19 pandemic and ones that may come at political price for a president whose standing with the US public is already weak. He said that the US will attempt to craft its sanctions to target the Russian economy, but that costs for the rest of the world were unavoidable. He announced that the US will release 30 million barrels of oil from its strategic reserve, but that move is more symbolic than it is likely to blunt the rising price of gas for American consumers. ""I know the news about what's happening can seem alarming,"" he said, ""but I want you to know that we are going to be OK."" That may be the most important message for Mr Biden's political fortunes. If the American public doesn't feel OK, the president and his party may bear the consequences in November's mid-term elections.

Russian oligarch warns sanctions will not stop war,"This video can not be played Mikhail Fridman said the conflict in Ukraine should be stopped as soon as possible One of Russia's richest men has said imposing sanctions on oligarchs would have no impact on Moscow's decision to launch a war in Ukraine. Billionaire banker Mikhail Fridman told a press conference in London the war was a tragedy for both sides. But he stopped short of direct criticism, saying personal remarks could be a risk not just to himself but also staff and colleagues. He joins another businessman, Oleg Deripaska, in calls for peace. The two men are the most prominent oligarchs to speak out against Russia's invasion, now in its sixth day. The UK also sanctioned Belarusian military chiefs on Tuesday for their role in ""abetting"" the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The Foreign Office said the Belarusian military has ""supported and enabled the Russian invasion of Ukraine"" and has also sanctioned some of its state manufacturing firms. The Belarus sanctions are on top of those already applied on Minsk by the UK since 2020 when over 100 people and organisations were targeted in response to the fraudulent elections in Belarus. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Born in Ukraine before the break-up of the Soviet Union, Mr Fridman was the founder of Russia's biggest private bank, Alfa, and runs investment firm LetterOne which has extensive interests in oil and retailing. The billionaire said the sanctions, which freeze some assets and impose a travel ban, were unjustified and he would fight them. But he added the sanctions would, in any case, not have the desired effect of helping to rein in the Kremlin. He said: ""My parents always told me: you know, because you are a Jew, you could not be in this position or that position, in this university or this job. ""Now, I'm facing the same situation here in the West, because you are Russian."" On Monday, the European Union slapped sanctions on Mr Fridman, who lives in London, and long-time partner Pyotr Aven. The EU statement described Mr Fridman as ""a top Russian financier and enabler of Putin's inner circle"". Mr Fridman said the conflict in Ukraine should end as soon as possible, but avoided questions about outright condemnation of President Vladimir Putin's actions. ""Please, don't push me to comment,"" he said, adding it would be not just ""my personal risk, but also a risk for my colleagues and staff"". He said his companies had tens of thousands of staff in Russia, Ukraine and the UK. ""It's a very sensitive issue. We have a dozens of partners and I do not have a right to put all of them at risk."" Mr Deripaska, who founded one of Russia's largest industrial groups, has also pleaded for peace in a post on the messaging app Telegram. Russian billionaire oligarchs do not give many press conferences. In some Western circles, the mere sight of banker and industrialist Mikhail Fridman defending himself after being sanctioned by the EU, shows the strategy of squeezing Russia financially is having the desired impact. Mr Fridman, who was born in Ukraine, said sanctions were having a drastic impact on the Russian economy, and called for an end to the conflict - but said he had no influence over the actions of President Putin. The founder of Alfabank said when asked if there was a bank run in Russia, that there was huge pressure on the Russian currency the rouble. He said many Russians were going to banks to withdraw roubles to convert into dollars because of dramatic moves in value, to keep hard currency ""under the mattress"". But he feels the EU is treating him unfairly and without due process, that he should be sent back to Russia, for having been born in the former Soviet Union. And tellingly, while wishing for the war to end, he said journalists could not expect him to criticize President Putin, given the risk to his staff in Russia and Ukraine.

Shop prices rise at fastest rate in over ten years,"Prices in shops rose at their fastest rate in over a decade in February, the British Retail Consortium (BRC) says. Shop price inflation jumped from 1.5% in January to 1.8% in February, according to the BRC-NielsenIQ price index. It marks the highest rate of inflation it has recorded since November 2011. The sharp rise was partly driven by fresh food price rises and higher prices for other goods such as beauty and furniture products. Many people have been struggling with a cost of living crisis as fuel prices and energy bills continue to soar. The latest official figures provided by the Office for National Statistics (ONS) showed living costsrising at their highest rate for 30 years. Why are prices rising so quickly? UK wage growth lags rising cost of living What help with bills is there in my council tax band? Non-food inflation rose to 1.3% in February, rising from 0.9% in January which is its highest rate since September 2011, the BRC said on Wednesday. The inflation rate for fresh food, which measures how quickly costs for everyday items increase over time, rose to 3.3% - up from 2.9% in January, according to the industry group. The BRC said this was partly because of poor harvests, both in the UK and overseas. Helen Dickinson, chief executive of the BRC, said that the price rises would be ""unwelcome news"" for households who already face taking how less because of energy price rises and higher National Insurance rates. Retailers, Ms Dickinson added, are still facing cost pressures from higher shipping rates, labour shortages, product price increases and rising energy prices. Many of these increases continue to be passed on to customers. This video can not be played Cost of living: âAll of a sudden thereâs no moneyâ ""Retailers are going to great lengths to mitigate against these price rises and support their customers, for example, many supermarkets have expanded their value ranges for food,"" Ms Dickinson continued. ""Unfortunately, there are limits to the costs that retailers can absorb,"" she added. Mike Watkins, head of retailer and business insight at research firm NielsenIQ, said he expects shop prices to continue to rise over the next few months. ""With falling disposable income for most households, retailers will need to keep encouraging customers to spend by offering choice and value and, for some, discounts as well as added benefits for loyal shoppers,"" Mr Watkins added. The Bank of England has warned the increase in the cost of living could exceed more than 7% this year. Food chains such as Greggs, have already raised the price of some goods in order to cover increased labour costs. The High Street retailer Next, has also said its prices could rise by up to 6% this year to keep up with higher costs. Supermarket giant Tesco has also warned that the ""worst is yet to come"" for rising food prices. Jack Monroe, a food poverty campaigner, has said that the prices of everyday essentials are going up by more than the official inflation rate, hitting the poorest hardest. The ONS agreed that ""one inflation rate doesn't fit all"" and said it would soon be publishing a wider variety of cost-of-living metrics. Why are prices rising in the UK?

Deadly blast at Kyiv TV tower after Russia warns capital,"Five people have died after Russia attacked a TV tower in Kyiv, hitting nearby broadcast facilities, Ukrainian officials say It comes after Russia warned residents that it was preparing to hit targets in the Ukrainian capital It said it was planning attacks on Kyiv technology centres, urging people to stay away A huge convoy of Russian armoured vehicles continues to advance on the city Freedom Square in central Kharkiv, Ukraine's second city, has been hit by a strike, killing at least 10 civilians In its latest assessment, the Pentagon says Russian troops have not taken Kharkiv or Mariupol, but they have occupied nearby towns UK PM Boris Johnson accuses Russia of ""barbaric and indiscriminate"" attacks Edited by Jude Sheerin For technical reasons too dull to tell you about here, our live coverage of the Ukraine crisis istransferring to a new page. Please follow us here. The BBC's US partner CBS News reports that the US will soon close its airspace to Russian aircraft. European nations and Canada have already shut their own airspace to air traffic from Russia. An order that bars Russian owned and operated aircraft from the US is expected within the next 24 hours. Some flights from Russia to the US have already been cancelled. Two people have been killed in an air strike on the city of Zhytomyr, west of Kyiv, according to the State Emergency Service of Ukraine. Three others were injured and more people may be trapped under rubble, the government service said. The SES also said at least 10 homes and a local hospital were damaged in the attack. It also released photos to show a fire broke out in some of the damaged homes. The BBC has not independently verified these claims. Two leading independent media outlets - TV Rain and the Ekho Moskvy (Echo of Moscow) radio channel - were taken off air on Tuesday night. This follows a complaint from the Russian prosecutor generalâs office that both outlets have been airing ""calls to extremist activities"" and ""premeditated false information about Russian servicemen"". Both TV Rain and Ekho Moskvy have denied the allegations. They remain visible and able to operate on social media and YouTube. Separately, Russian Wikipedia said that media watchdog Roskomnadzor had issued it with a warning, demanding it remove an article entitled ""Russian invasion of Ukraine 2022"", or risk being blocked. Russian authorities and the state-controlled media do not refer to the ""invasion"" of Ukraine or the ""war"", instead calling it a ""military operation"". Gennady Gatilov, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva Moscow has seen ""no desire on the part of Ukraine"" to reach a legitimate and balanced solution to the problems between the two countries, says a Russian diplomat. Gennady Gatilov, Russia's ambassador to the United Nations in Geneva, made these comments in an interview with a Lebanese TV station that aired on Tuesday. Russia ""supports diplomacy based on respect for the positions of all countries and equality, but for now we don't see that"", he said, according to Russian news agency RIA. Russia and Ukraine held peace talks on Monday, but no agreements were reached other than a commitment to meet again at an unspecified date. The World Bank Group and International Monetary Fund are preparing financing support for Ukraine. In a joint statement, leaders of the two agencies said they were worried by the potential spillover effects of the Russian invasion. They cited rising commodity prices, disruptions in financial markets and the risk of further fuelling global inflation. The World Bank said it would pledge $3bn (Â£2.3bn) in the coming months, including at least $350m in the next week. The IMF meanwhile said it will swiftly consider Ukraine's request for emergency financing. It also hopes to make $2.2bn in funding available up to June. Footage has emerged of a Ukrainian crowd mobbing a Russian vehicle in the embattled eastern city of Kharkiv. The verified footage,posted on social media,external, shows protesters hurling obscenities and attacking the vehicle with their bare fists. Some protesters wave Ukrainian flags and others throw objects at the vehicle as it speeds away. This video can not be played Ukraine: Polish communities help people fleeing war Thousands of people fleeing Ukraine have headed to Poland. And communities across the country, particularly along the border, have rallied to help them. The BBC went to a school that has been transformed into a shelter to speak to volunteers. Lyse DoucetChief International Correspondent, Kyiv As day six of Russiaâs invasion drew to a close in Kyiv, the air-raid siren sounded, five loud thuds of explosions shattered the night, and the mayor issued a warning. âDear friends, dear Kyivans"", the champion boxer turned politician Vitali Klitschko began. âI invite all of you to stay away from the streets and be extremely cautious. It is better to spend this night in a shelter,"" he said. Many are already bedded down in basements, bunkers, and bomb shelters, glued to their phones, after an even starker warning from Russiaâs Defence Ministry during the day. The announcement dropped that Russia would strike two key security installations with âhigh-precision weaponsâ, including the Security Service of Ukraine (SBU) and the 72nd Main Centre for Information and Psychological Operations. It called on residents who live near ârelay nodesâ to leave their homes in an apparent reference to communication towers. The TV tower, the tallest building in the country, did take a hit, reportedly from two missiles. Mayor Klitschko reported that experts were now working to restore the towerâs full operation. Those missiles also slammed into the adjacent Babyn Yar Holocaust Memorial to tens of thousands of Jews murdered by the Nazis in World War Two. âHistory repeatingâ¦â tweeted Ukraineâs President Volodmyr Zelensky as others mocked President Putinâs earlier call for a âde-nazificationâ of Ukraine. It underscored again the fatal mistakes and misfirings in every war, this one included. And a serpentine armoured convoy still lies in wait just 25km (15 miles) from Kyiv's city centre. Today a senior US defence official said it had advanced little â whether it was regrouping, running out of fuel and food, or facing restive troops, wasnât clear. The guessing game is ever-present. The Green Planet had been sold to âFriday!â a digital channel thatâs owned by Gazprom TV The BBC has announced that it will stop licensing content to Russia. This means the BBC will not make any new sales of programmes to Russian broadcasters - and had also made a formal request to purchasers to stop
broadcasting any more episodes of series it has already licensed. Series which will be affected include the Russian version of Strictly Come Dancing spin-off, Dancing With The Stars, and Sir David Attenborough's recent The Green Planet documentary. ITV  have done the same, saying: ""We have made
the decision to stop new sales to Russian clients as we do not believe it
appropriate to be doing business with them at this time."" And the Producers Alliance for Cinema and
TV - the UK's trade association for independent producers - has already removed all Russian production and business information from its
website and is calling on its members to suspend all co-operation and trade with Russia
for the time being. Many sectors have been distancing themselves from Russia in recent days - with several major Hollywood
entertainment companies pausing the release of films in Russia. Five people died in the attack on the tower on Tuesday The Yad Vashem Holocaust Memorial - the museum dedicated to remembering the Nazi genocide of Jews during World War Two - has condemned the rocket attack on a TV tower in Kyiv which damaged a nearby Holocaust memorial. The museum voiced its ""vehement condemnation"" to what it called a ""deadly Russian attack on the vicinity of the Babyn Yar Holocaust memorial site"". A statement from Israel's foreign minister called for ""the sanctity of the site to be preserved and honoured"", but did not condemn Russia for the attack. The memorial is built on Europe's largest mass grave of the Holocaust,where Nazi death squads killed more than 33,000 Jewish peoplein the space of just two days in 1941. Ukraine's president described the attack near the site on Tuesday as ""history repeating"". Phone call follows China's abstention from a UN vote last week condemning the invasion China's Foreign Minister Wang Yi and and his Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba, have discussed the conflict engulfing the eastern European nation in a call. Wang told Kuleba he ""deeply regrets"" the conflict and is ""paying extreme attention to the harm suffered by civilians"", according to the AFP news agency quoting Chinese state media. He also called for both sides to ""find a way to resolve the issue through negotiations"", the same source reported. In the call, which marks the first between the two men since Russia's invasion on Thursday, Kuleba asked Beijing to use its ties with Moscow to help halt the invasion, the Reuters news agency said. Wang is said to have offered to make every effort to end the violence diplomatically, the agency wrote. Last week, defying expectation from experts, China abstained from a UN Security Council vote condemning the invasion of Ukraine. Some analysts had expected Beijing to join Russia in voting against the motion. Read more: Protesters chanted ""no to war"" in the centre of St Petersburg More than 90 protesters were arrested in the western Russian city of St Petersburg on Tuesday while protesting against the war in Ukraine, according to the BBC Russian Service. The protest took place at the Gostiny Dvor shopping centre on Nevsky Avenue in the city centre. Russian police arrested the protesters, and at least one journalist, in the space of 30 minutes, our colleagues report, citing the Zaks.ru publication. A day earlier, police in the city detained some 900 anti-war protesters. Member countries of the International Energy Agency (IEA), the Paris-based intergovernmental agency that advises on oil policy, have agreed to release 60 million barrels of oil from their emergency reserves amid the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The move comes as oil prices have risen sharply and fears of energy supply issues have emerged. The 31 members of the IEA agreed to release reserves in order to ""send a unified and strong message to global oil markets that there will be no shortfall in supplies"" as a result of the Ukraine conflict, the group said. Members include the US, UK, EU nations, Mexico, Canada, Japan and others. ""Todayâs announcement is another example of partners around the world condemning Russiaâs unprovoked and unjustified invasion of Ukraine,"" the White House said, adding that efforts to get away from Russian energy supplies continued. Earlier this week, oil giants Shell and BP said they would off-load stakes in Russian energy companies and stop projects. If you woke up this morning, looked at the news, and felt increasingly worried about the war in Ukraine, you are not alone. After a two-year pandemic, it's a lot to absorb, and experts agree that feeling overwhelmed is normal. While it's right to think first and foremost about the impact on those caught up in the conflict, it's also completely normal to feel upset from afar by what we're seeing in Ukraine, says Alex Bushill, from the mental health charity Mind. ""It's very natural to be distressed by what we're seeing, you wouldn't be human if you didn't,"" he says. This doesn't always lead to anxiety, but the NHS and Anxiety UK agree on some key ways to avoid it: eat well, get outside, put your phone down, connect with people, rest. These are all pretty basic pieces of advice, but when you're stressed, they can be difficult to do consistently. Read more advice and guidance here. We've news of more action being taken by Apple.The tech giant has paused sales of its products in Russia, the company has announced. The company has also limited its payments system, Apple Pay, and other services including live-traffic tracking, according to the Reuters news agency. The BBC's Ukrainian service reports that consumers in Russia attempting to buy an iPhone, watch or MacBook on the company's website are greeted with a message saying that delivery of the goods is impossible. The move by Apple comes after Ukrainian Vice Prime Minister Mykhailo Fedorov disclosed earlier this week that he had sent a letter to the company's chairman Tim Cook asking that Apple be blocked from Russia.

Google has removed the Russian state media outlet RT from its news search tool. ""In this extraordinary crisis we are taking extraordinary measures to stop the spread of misinformation and disrupt disinformation campaigns online,"" Kent Walker, Google's president of global affairs said. The company already had restricted Russian government-funded news sites from advertising and using some features on YouTube, the video-sharing platform owned by Google. RT's deputy editor-in-chief Anna Belkina said the move was evidence that ""establishment"" Western companies are ""terrified of a mere presence of any outside voice for the fear of losing their historically captive audience, if that audience encounters a different perspective"". RT and Sputnik, another government-funded site, are considered by the US State department to be two ""critical elements in Russiaâs disinformation and propaganda ecosystem,external"". Tech giant Apple has also said that RT and Sputnik would no longer be available for download on its app store outside Russia. US defence officials say Russia's operation has moved much more slowly than planned, and now faces supply shortages. The Pentagon said Russian forces had not yet taken control of Ukraine's skies after six days, nor had they taken key targets such as the country's second city, Kharkiv, or the southern port of Mariupol. ""In many cases, what we're seeing are columns that are literally out of gas,"" one official is quoted as saying by the AFP news agency. ""Now they're starting to run out of food for their troops."" The official also said there were signs of morale problems in the Russian force, which makes use of a large number of conscript soldiers. ""Not all of them were apparently fully trained and prepared, or even aware that they were going to be sent into a combat operation. We have picked up independently on our own indications that morale is flagging in some of these units""  Russian driver Nikita Mazepin can race this season with Haas Motorsport's governing bodythe FIA has ruled that Russian drivers can continue to compete in global events, though not under the Russian flag. The same will apply to Belarusian drivers due to Minsk's support for the Russian invasion of Ukraine. The decision will allow Russian driver Nikita Mazepin to race in F1 this season with the Haas team. Competitors from the two countries will fly a neutral banner and must make âspecific commitment and adherence to the FIAâs principles of peace and political neutrality, until further noticeâ, the body said. The decision follows that of the International Olympic Committee and Fifa deciding to enact an outright ban on Russian competitors. The FIA also announced it would cancel the upcoming Intercontinental Drifting Cup event that was to be held in Sochi, Russia, this summer. What other action has sport taken in response to Russia's invasion? Myroslava PetsaBBC News Ukrainian Their city has been shelled
with Grad rockets, hit by cruise missiles and air bombardment. But life goes on for the
children of the Kharkiv Hippocrates centre where they treat patients with the
most serious nervous system conditions. The centre is a hospice and a rehabilitation facility. Its head, Dr Roman Marabyan, had been called up to the army, so I spoke to his deputy, Valentyna Drokina. She seems overoptimistic for a doctor stuck with her patients in a city thatâs
been seeing no reprieve from Russia. In more peaceful times, the centre used to care for dozens of young patients from the Kharkiv
region and north-eastern Ukraine. Some children were orphans - their parents abandoned them in state facilities after learning their
diagnoses. The centreâs nurses and doctors have become not just childrenâs
carers, but parental figures. Other children usually had
mothers by their side. The war has brought all of
them together. âWe are one family now,â says
Valentyna Drokina. Her centre welcomes all abandoned children with
life-threatening conditions and those with their parents who didnât have enough
time to flee Kharkiv. Out of 21 children that are
being treated in this facility, only three can walk on their feet. Valentyna tells me the centreâs professionals had equipped its basement so that the
children could spend the most dangerous hours down there. âWhen itâs needed, every
adult comes up to the kids, each takes one child and runs with them to the cellar,"" she says. ""Children have no idea of whatâs going on. They think we are playing with them""  The centre is home not just to its young patients and their parents, but also to the staff who work there. Valentyna says they even found room for three ordinary families who couldnât find a safe place to stay. âWe are OK as long as there are no power outages.â She says the area hasnât been shelled with Grad rockets, so theyâre staying strong.

Biden to warn Putin: 'Dictators must pay a price',"Ukraine's President Zelensky has asked Vladimir Putin for one-to-one talks, saying this is the only way to end the war He also appealed to the West to ""give me planes"" to fight invasion Russian and Ukrainian negotiators agree to organise humanitarian corridors to evacuate civilians Meanwhile Putin insists the war is ""going to plan"", despite taking only one major city The UK has imposed sanctions on two more Russian oligarchs In Mariupol, a southern port near Ukraine's border with Russia, civilians are trapped by intense shelling If Russia captures more southern cities, Ukrainian forces could be cut off from the sea Kyiv remains in government control and a large Russian armoured convoy is some distance away More than one million people have fled Ukraine since the invasion began Edited by Jessica Murphy For technical reasons weâre switching our live coverage to a different webpage. To continue to follow our around-the-clock live coverage,please click here  The International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) has said it is in contact with Ukrainian authorities over the reports of shelling at the the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant. A spokesperson for the plant has also taken to social media asking that Russian forces ""stop the heavy weapons fire"". âThere is a real threat of nuclear danger in the biggest atomic energy station in Europe,â Andriy Tuz said in a video on Telegram, according to the Associated Press. Tuz said the plant is under direct attack from Russian shelling and firefighters are not able to go near the fire that had broken out. He added the reactor that is on fire was under renovation and is not currently operational, but it contains nuclear fuel. Zaporizhzhia reportedly accounts for some 25% of the country's power. Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba says Russian troops are ""firing from all sides"" at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear plant, the largest plant in Europe. As we just reported, local officials say that a fire has broken out in the plant because of these attacks. ""Russians must IMMEDIATELY cease the fire, allow firefighters, establish a security zone!"" he wrote on Twitter. Laura Rockwood, the director of the Open Nuclear Network non-profit, earlier told the BBC's Radio 4 that the war could have an impact on Ukraine's electricity grid, which depends on nuclear power. She said military activity around a plant poses two direct risks to nuclear instillations - potential damage to a plant's infrastructure and harm to its personnel, or much more serious damage that affects a plant's operational abilities that could cause a meltdown. A fire has reportedly broken out at the Zaporizhzhia nuclear power plant, the largest in Europe. It appears to have been caused by ""continuous enemy shelling of [the plant's] buildings and units"", according to Mayor Dmytro Orlov of nearby Enerhodar. Orlov had previously reported intense fighting between Ukrainian and Russian forces on the outskirts of his city, which is in the southeast. Russian troops had tried to enter the city in tanks and seize the plant, but residents and workers were seen congregating around the plant and its surrounding roads on Wednesday. Ukraine has four active nuclear plants including Zaporizhzhia. It also deals with nuclear waste at sites like Chernobyl, now under Russian control. The International Atomic Energy Agency said earlier today that it is consulting with Ukraine ""and others with a view to provide maximum possible assistance to the country as it seeks to maintain nuclear safety and security in the current difficult circumstances"". OneWeb, the satellite company part-owned by the UK government, says it is suspending all launches from the Russian-operated Baikonur spaceport. The firm had hoped to send up 36 spacecraft on a Soyuz rocket from the Kazakhstan cosmodrome, but the mission has become embroiled in the fall-out over the invasion of Ukraine. Russia had sought a guarantee that armed forces would not use the satellites. It also wanted the UK government to divest itself of OneWeb shares, an ultimatum rejected by Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng. Read morehere. Enerhodar's nuclear cooling towers, pictured before the war Wladimir Klitschko, the champion boxer and brother of the Kyiv mayor, has said that Ukraine's nuclear plants are being threatened by the Russian invasion, warning of a potential repeat of the 1986 Chernobyl disaster. Earlier, we reported fierce shelling in Enerhodar, in south-eastern Ukraine, the home of one of Europe's largest nuclear plants. The local mayor has already warned that there is no water supply or electricity in the town, due to the onslaught. Klitschko tweeted today: ""Ukraine has 4 nuclear power plants and Russian army is shooting rockets and bombing right next to it. Donât look away, STOP  Russian invasion NOW!!!"" The International Atomic Energy Agency Director General Rafael Grossi in a statement today called on all the military forces operating around Enerhodar to refrain from violence near the plant. On Wednesday, he said the countryâs nuclear power plants ""must be able to continue operating without any safety or security threats. Any accident caused as a result of the military conflict could have extremely serious consequences for people and the environment, in Ukraine and beyond"". Russian forces seized control of the shuttered Chernobyl nuclear power plant about a week ago. Ukrainian officials reported radiation levels had been ""exceeded"" in a number of places in the area at the time, but Russia said that was not the case. The producer is accused of working with sanctioned oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev (pictured) A former TV producer for Fox News was arrested in London last month at the request of the US, and American officials are now seeking to extradite him. American John ""Jack"" Hanik, 71, is accused of violating sanctions imposed in 2014 after Russia's invasion of Crimea. Prosecutors say he worked with a sanctioned Russian businessman to set up pro-Kremlin TV channels in Europe. Hanik is accused of working with oligarch Konstantin Malofeyev, who the US Justice Department says ""is closely tied to Russian aggression in Ukraine"". Malofeyev, the US says, was ""one of the main sources of financing for Russians promoting separatism in Crimea,"" and has provided material and financial assistance to separatists in Donetsk. ""The defendant Hanick knowingly chose to help Malofeyev spread his destabilising messages by establishing, or attempting to establish, TV networks in Russia, Bulgaria, and Greece, in violation of those sanctions,â the US statement adds. Yellowknife is a city in the Northwest Territories of Canada Canadian transport officials have grounded a charter plane carrying two Russian citizens who appeared to be headed to the Arctic to conduct an expedition. ""A charter aircraft that carried Russian foreign nationals has been held at the Yellowknife airport,"" Canada's transport minister tweeted on Thursday. ""We will continue to hold Russia accountable for its invasion of Ukraine."" The plane will be held until officials complete an assessment to determine if the flight violated the new ban on Russian planes in Canada's airspace. It's unclear what is happening to the Russians passengers aboard the plane. Ukrainian nationals present in the US as of this past Tuesday will be allowed to remain in the country under a special non-immigrant category. US Secretary of Homeland Security Alejandro Mayorkas announced the move on Thursday evening, saying the government would extend the 'Temporary Protected Status' (TPS) to Ukrainians. Homeland Security typically designates nationalities under TPS due to ongoing armed conflict, natural disasters, epidemics or ""other extraordinary and temporary conditions"" that prevent people from safely returning to their home countries. Nationals from 12 countries are already protected under TPS. They include Burma, Haiti, Syria and Yemen. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In separate phone conversations with Vladimir Putin and Volodymyr Zelensky, he expressed support for ""a political solution"" to their conflict. He told Zelensky that the kingdom will extend the visas of Ukrainian tourists and residents that are due to expire by three more months. According to Saudi Arabian media, it was Putin who called the Crown Prince, who then ""clarified the kingdom's stated position"" on the war in Ukraine. The Kremlin, in its own readout of the call, said both leaders discussed energy concerns and ""will continue to coordinate their approaches"" on oil production, as key partners in the OPEC+ alliance. ""Taking into account the anti-Russian sanctions imposed by a number of Western countries, Vladimir Putin emphasised the inadmissibility of politicising the issues of global energy supply,"" it said. Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko has cast doubt over the viability of peace talks with Russia. Speaking to BBC Newsnight, he says it is impossible to trust Russia's President Putin to keep his word. Watch what he has to say here: This video can not be played Poroshenko became Ukraine's president in 2014, and lost to Volodymyr Zelensky in 2019 Watch the full interview on Newsnight onBBC Twoat 22:30 GMT (UK only). Good evening to those of you just joining us, here's a round-up of today's main events on day eight of Russia's invasion of Ukraine.  You can read more on today's developmentshere. Duncan KennedyBBC News Correspondent President Biden was
pretty blunt in announcing thenew package of sanctions on Russia. He said its oligarchs were lining their pockets with the Russian peopleâs money while Ukraine
and its people were hiding in subways to protect themselves from Russian
missiles. Biden added that sanctions against President Putin and those
around him were already having a âprofound impactâ. The additional list of eight
names of those to be sanctioned by the US is interesting. They include former friends of Putin during his time in the KGB
in East Germany and one of his former judo training partners. They
also include the Kremlin press secretary who, the Americans say, is a ""top purveyor of Putinâs propaganda"". And weâre told a lot of these Russians have
houses and other major assets in the US. Earlier on Thursday, the White House also told us that President Biden had no plans to talk to, or meet, President Putin
to discuss ways of halting the invasion. The Russian rouble has hit record lows in recent days Ratings agency S&P has cut Russia's credit rating from ""BB+"" to ""CCC-"". ""The downgrade follows the imposition of measures that we believe will likely substantially increase the risk of default,"" the agency said on Thursday. It comes less than a week after S&P's last downgrade of Russian debt. On Wednesday, Moodyâs Investors Service and Fitch Ratings also downgraded Russia's rating by several notches. Both indicated further downgrades were likely. It means Russian debt is now considered sub-investment grade, or in ""junk"" territory, by all three of the world's major ratings companies. The Russian rouble has hit record lows in the wake of heavy sanctions. Nada TawfikNorth America correspondent, BBC News The war in Ukraine has put international arts
organisations in a difficult position, and many have chosen to take a principled
stance. The Metropolitan Opera, based in New York, just announced that their superstar Russian
soprano, Anna Netrebko, will no longer perform this season or next after she
failed to comply with their demand that she repudiates her support for Vladimir
Putin. General manager Peter Gelb said the loss of Netrebko â one of the best singers in Met Opera history â was a great artistic
loss. But, he said: ""With Putin killing
innocent victims in Ukraine, there was no way forward."" The soprano will be replaced by a Ukrainian, Liudmyla Monastyrska, who
made her debut in the opera house in 2012. Increasingly, it looks like Russiaâs isolation internationally will be felt for
some time: a Met official said it would be hard to imagine a scenario where Netrebko would be able to return to the opera house. Billionaire Alisher Usmanov will be among those sanctioned by the US The Biden administration has announced a fresh round of sanctions against Russian oligarchs. Eight wealthy elites will be cut off by the US financial system and see their assets frozen, including billionaire Alisher Usmanov, Kremlin press secretary Dmitry Peskov and oil executive Nikolai Tokarev. In addition, 19 oligarchs and 47 of their family members and closest associates will be banned from traveling to America. The White House also said it will sanction seven Russian entities and 26 individuals for their role in spreading ""false narratives that advance Russian strategic objectives and falsely justify the Kremlinâs activities"". President Joe Biden noted on Thursday that sanctions already in place have ""had a profound impact"". Now, he said, Western allies are headed toward ""the strongest unified economic impact campaign on Putin in all history"". Former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko tells the BBC the ""whole nation is beating Putin"", as he urges his fellow citizens to never give up. ""He can switch off the lights, he can switch off the supply of the warmth, but he cannot kill Ukrainian soul,"" he says. Poroshenko was Ukraine's president for five years, until Volodymyr Zelenskywon a landslidein the 2019 election. Watch what he's got to say below.

"Sainsburyâs cafe closures puts 2,000 jobs at risk","Sainsbury's is set to close 200 of its in-store cafes next month, putting about 2,000 jobs at risk. The supermarket has also announced plans to close less popular hot food counters in 34 stores. Chief executive Simon Roberts said the chain was ""absolutely committed"" to supporting the members of staff affected. They will be prioritised for vacant jobs and encouraged to look at alternative roles within the business. It comes as part of new plans aimed at updating the supermarket's eat-in, takeaway and home delivery food and drink offer for customers. The move follows a trial of a new ""food hall"" format called The Restaurant Hub at its Selly Oak store in Birmingham. Sainsbury's raises pay to Â£10 an hour Champagne sales give Sainsbury's bumper Christmas 'UK first' in Tesco's carbon reduction push Off the back of the trial, Sainsbury's plans to open 30 more of the food halls in 2022, as well as 30 Starbucks coffee shops in its supermarkets over the next 12 months. It is currently working in partnership with the Boparan Restaurant Group on the project. As part of the trial, customers were able to choose options from the likes of Gourmet Burger Kitchen, Ed's Diner and Slim Chickens. Sainsbury's said it could increase the number of food halls in future years, if they continued to perform well with customers. The remaining 67 cafes will remain open while Sainsbury's reviews roll-out plans. In a statement, the supermarket said it had spoken to all of its cafe workers today about the closure plans. It also said that it would ""simplify the way it runs its bakeries"" in 54 stores and hold talks with those workers and those on the hot food counters, with the aim of redeploying them in other departments in-store if possible. The retailer has already closed its fresh fish, cheese and meat counters in stores,which saw about 3,500 jobs cut. Mr Roberts said: ""We are totally focused on improving what we can deliver for our customers and at the same time, working hard to make our business simpler. ""We are really excited about this new customer offer we will be rolling out over the next two to three years across many of our stores."" Sainsbury's said it could increase the number of food halls in future years, if they do well with customers. He added, however, that he acknowledged this was an ""uncertain"" time for many members of staff. ""Of course, we understand this is very unsettling for our colleagues, but we must keep adapting our business to make sure we are offering customers the best possible food and drink at affordable prices,"" he said. Susannah Streeter, senior investment analyst at Hargreaves Lansdown, said the announcement marked the latest in a raft of restructuring moves as the supermarket seeks to keep a lid on rising costs - and compete with the likes of discounters Aldi and Lidl. ""The chain is clearly hoping customers will 'taste the difference' via these tie-ups... while its own staff costs are taken out of the equation and it can concentrate spend on the business of filling trollies and virtual baskets instead,"" she said. Sainsbury's is the first of the ""big four"" supermarkets to restructure its cafes. It's all part of a wider plan to simplify the business and save money. CaffÃ¨ Carluccio's is going to be the main offer and it will work alongside one or two other brands using the same kitchen, which will fulfil orders for home deliveries and takeaways too. Sixty-seven Sainsbury's cafes remain, for now. They provide hot food like a cooked breakfast and are still popular with shoppers. So bringing in these new, popular, brands is an eye-catching move. Other new partners could also be brought in. Will shoppers will miss the old cafes? The new ones won't be as cheap. But in-store cafes are hard work to run. Sainsbury's is prioritising its food offer in the aisles and trying to stay as competitive as possible on price. But Unite the union hit out at Sainsbury's, demanding compulsory redundancies for cafe workers should be ruled out. Unite national officer for food, drink and agriculture, Bev Clarkson, said: ""Our members showed great loyalty to Sainsbury's during the pandemic. They served their communities during lockdown and ensured Sainsbury's flourished when other businesses flatlined. ""Now Sainsbury's must repay them by keeping job losses to an absolute minimum and ruling out compulsory redundancies,"" she said. Richard Lim, the chief executive of Retail Economics added that the pandemic had brought about huge changes for the food industry. ""Disruptive technologies have created near frictionless access to groceries, takeaway and food on-demand, resulting in greater competition and the merging of channels,"" he said. He added that takeaways could be a ""lucrative opportunity"" for supermarkets which have enough stores to supply large numbers of people with lots of different cuisines. ""The takeaway market has seen impressive growth in recent years as digital platforms provide greater choice, faster deliveries and more competition. So there's no surprise that the supermarkets are trying to establish a firm foothold in the market and cater for evolving consumer habits.""

VideoUkrainian cities hit by heavy shelling,"This video can not be played Dozens of people have been killed in Russian missile strikes on Ukraine's second city, Kharkiv, officials say. Videos shared on social media showed rockets landing in Kharkiv, in what some defence analysts described as typical of a cluster munition strike on a dense urban area. Russia has previously denied targeting residential areas. Thick black smoke could also been seen billowing from destroyed a shopping centre in the city of Chernihiv, north of Ukraine. The footage in this video has been verified by the BBC, but the sources of some sections are unknown.

"West was ready for Russian invasion, says Biden","This video can not be played Watch: Standing ovation for Ukrainian ambassador at Biden speech US President Joe Biden has told Congress that Vladimir Putin badly misjudged how the West would hit back once he invaded Ukraine. In a primetime speech, Mr Biden vowed ""an unwavering resolve that freedom will always triumph over tyranny"". Democrats and Republicans reacted to Mr Biden's appeal to show support for Ukraine by rising in unison to applaud. His State of the Union address came as pandemic-weary Americans grapple with galloping inflation. In an hour-long address to lawmakers on Tuesday night, the Democratic president said: ""Putin's war was premeditated and unprovoked. He rejected repeated efforts at diplomacy. ""He thought the West and Nato wouldn't respond. And he thought he could divide us here at home."" Mr Biden - whose chaotic withdrawal last year from Afghanistan damaged his popularity among Americans - added: ""Putin was wrong. We were ready."" He announced that the US would ban Russian aircraft from American airspace, following similar bans by Canadian and European authorities. What message was Biden sending to Putin? Follow live updates from the ground Why Biden won't send troops to Ukraine The US and its allies have launched a barrage of sanctions against Russia's economy and financial system and Mr Putin himself. In his speech Mr Biden deviated from his prepared remarks by vowing further economic retaliation, warning Mr Putin: ""He has no idea what's coming."" The US president also welcomed Ukrainian Ambassador Oksana Markarova, who received a standing ovation as she sat in US First Lady Jill Biden's VIP box. THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine? RUSSIA SANCTIONS:'If I could leave, I would' UKRAINE:Desperate scenes in Lviv train station IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict Hours before his address, Mr Biden spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky to discuss what help the US could give his country after six days of the Russian assault. ""Let each of us... stand and send an unmistakable signal to Ukraine and to the world,"" Mr Biden told his audience in the chamber of the House of Representatives. It was one of the few moments in the speech where members of both deeply polarised parties rose together to clap and cheer for Ukraine, many of them waving Ukrainian flags that had been passed out before the president arrived. Mr Biden's first formal State of the Union speech, an annual event pushing a president's agenda, came as his approval rating languishes. Just 40.6% of Americans are happy with his job performance, according to the RealClearPolitics polling average. After addressing his biggest foreign policy crisis, the invasion of Ukraine, Mr Biden confronted a host of domestic troubles dogging his presidency, from the enduring pandemic, to soaring consumer prices, to a wave of violent crime. Ukraine flags and badges were in evidence Although the US jobless rate has sunk to 4%, inflation has hit a 40-year high. The president sought on Tuesday night to empathise with hard-pressed working families, saying: ""I get it."" He promised a plan for ""building a better America"". Mr Biden argued the best way to counter rocketing consumer prices was to boost domestic production of cars and semiconductors and rebuild the nation's roads and bridges. Opinion polls show Americans are also unhappy with Mr Biden's handling of the coronavirus pandemic. But on Tuesday, members of Congress who attended the speech were not required to wear masks for the first time in months. Mr Biden said: ""Last year Covid-19 kept us apart. This year we are finally together again.""Â Biden's first year in office - in six charts Five voters give their verdict on Biden More than 2,000 Americans are still dying daily of Covid, according to the latest figures, the highest official tally of any country in the world. With the nation's homicide rate having hit a 25-year high, Mr Biden rejected calls to defund the police that were taken up by a wide spectrum of his fellow Democrats. ""The answer is not to defund the police,"" said the president.Â ""The answer is to fund them."" Iowa Governor Kim Reynolds delivered the Republican response to Mr Biden's speech. She sought to portray a presidency that had sent America back to the late '70s ""when runaway inflation was hammering families, a violent crime wave was crashing on our cities, and the Soviet army was trying to redraw the world map"".

Putin using barbaric tactics - Boris Johnson,"This video can not be played Ukrainian in tears during question to UK PM Vladimir Putin is engaging in ""barbaric and indiscriminate"" tactics targeting civilians, Boris Johnson has said. The prime minister said the Russian president had ""fatally underestimated"" the willingness of the Ukrainian people to fight - and the resolve of the West. Speaking during a visit to Poland, he also said the UK had set aside Â£220m in humanitarian aid. Meanwhile, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has said ""nothing and no one is off the table"" for further sanctions. The UK is considering calling for Russia to be expelled from the UN Security Council, the BBC understands. Mr Johnson said he was ""increasingly confident"" Russia's invasion would not succeed, adding that Mr Putin ""must fail"" in his aims in Ukraine. During a news conference with his Polish counterpart Mateusz Morawiecki in the Polish capital Warsaw, he said Mr Putin was prepared to ""bomb tower blocks, to send missiles into tower blocks, to kill children, as we are seeing in increasing numbers"". The sixth day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine has seen continued attacks on several fronts, but the Russian advance has reportedly been slowed by Ukrainian resistance. Earlier, Russia attacked a TV tower in Kyiv - with Ukrainian officials saying five people were killed. Missiles and rockets have also killed dozens of civilians in Kharkiv, Ukraine's second largest city, and satellite images show a hugearmoured convoyheading towards Kyiv.

NUCLEAR ALERT:What are the risks? MAPS:Tracking day five of Russia's invasion IN DEPTH:Full coverage of the conflict At a further news conference with the Estonian prime minister and the Nato secretary-general in the Estonian capital Tallinn, Mr Johnson said the international community must do everything it can to support Ukrainians, but said ""we will not fight Russian forces in Ukraine"". He said the UK was not actively supporting its citizens to volunteer to fight in Ukraine and ruled out a no-fly zone over the country. Ukraine hascalled for help to enforce a no-fly zone- which would be designed to stop Russian air raids - in a bid to protect civilians. This video can not be played Building hit by missile in Kharkiv's Freedom Square In a speech after the news conference in Warsaw, Mr Johnson announced the emergency aid and said the UK had placed 1,000 troops on standby to help with the humanitarian response in Europe. He said the government was making it easier for Ukrainians in the UK to bring their relatives out of the country, byextending the scheme to help those fleeing the war- which could see the UK take in more than 200,000 Ukranian refugees. The scheme is being extended to include immediate Ukrainian family members - meaning adult parents, grandparents, children over 18 and siblings of those settled in the UK. But Home Secretary Priti Patel said the UK could not waive the need for visas for people fleeing Ukraine as it had to protect national security. She also announced a ""humanitarian sponsorship pathway"" for Ukrainians without ties to the UK to come to the UK by working for individuals, businesses, charities and community groups in the UK. Mr Johnson has also warned there would be a cost to Western economies as a result of sanctions, adding it was essential Europe ""wean ourselves off dependence"" on Russian oil and gas exports. Boris Johnson met troops at the Tapa military base in Estonia Following his speech, Mr Johnson was confronted by a Ukrainian who criticised Nato's response to the invasion, and asked why Russian oligarch and Chelsea Football Club owner Roman Abramovich, thought to have close ties to Mr Putin,had not been sanctioned by the UK. Daria Kaleniuk, the executive director of the Ukrainian civil society organization Anti-Corruption Action Centre, said: ""You are talking about more sanctions prime minister but Roman Abramovich is not sanctioned, he's in London, his children are not in the bombardments, his children are there in London."" Mr Johnson said he welcomed her question - but he was ""acutely conscious that there is not enough we can do as the UK government to help in the way that you want"". Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has warned ""nothing and no-one is off the table"" in terms of further sanctions on the Russian economy, Mr Putin and the ""highest echelons of the Russian elite"". She told the UN Human Rights Council in Geneva the Russian president was responsible for civilian deaths and more than half a million refugees so far. On Tuesday evening, the governmentannounced new sanctions against Belarusian individuals and organisations.Belarus is closely aligned with Russia and there is speculation troops from Belarus could join the fight on Russia's side. During a visit to a Ukrainian church in west London, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer told one parishioner he would ""talk to the government"" about a no-fly zone. Sir Keir also said ""we need to go further in our support for Ukraine"", adding that he did not think the government had gone far enough to help people who were fleeing.

Mr Johnson said: ""I think that everybody involved in the Russian onslaught should understand that all this will be collated in evidence to be used at a future time in what could be proceedings before the International Criminal Court.""

"UK sanctions Belarus for role in Ukraine invasionThe foreign secretary says Belarus ""actively aids and abets Russiaâs illegal invasion"" of Ukraine.UK Politics","Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko is a close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin The UK has targeted Belarusian army chiefs as part of its first wave of sanctions against Belarus for its role in Russia's invasion of Ukraine. Four defence officials and two military enterprises are included in the package. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said Belarus leader Alexander Lukashenko had aided and abetted Russia's invasion. Mr Lukashenko has hosted Russian forces and allowed them to use Belarus as a staging ground. A close ally of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Mr Lukashenko's administration has become increasingly reliant on Russia for economic, political and military support in recent years. Mr Putin backed Mr Lukashenko after he claimed a disputed election victory in 2020, sparking mass protests that almost ousted him from power. Belarus crackdown fails to crush opposition spirit Fear and violence in the jails of Belarus Lukashenko: We may have helped migrants into EU In January this year,Belarus hosted large joint military drills with Russiaas western leaders issued increasingly grave warnings of a possible attack on Ukraine. The exercises were extended and then Belarus announced that the Russian troops would remain in the country, citing ""the aggravation of the situation"" in eastern Ukraine. But on Monday, Mr Lukashenko said Belarus had no plans to join Russia's military operation in Ukraine, according to state news agency Belta. Mr Lukashenko denied Ukraine's allegations that Russian troops were attacking from Belarus's territory, Belta's report said. Announcing sanctions on Tuesday,external, the UK government accused Belarus of ""facilitating the invasion from within its borders"". Those sanctioned include: Belarus's deputy defence minister, Major GeneralVictor Gulevich, who is ""responsible for directing the actions of the Belarusian armed forces"" Major GeneralAndrei Burdyko, a logistics chief; Major GeneralSergei Simonenko, an arms chief; and Major GeneralAndrey Zhuk, Belarus's deputy minister of defence Also sanctioned areJSC Integral, a military semi-conductor manufacturer, andJSC 558 Aircraft Repair Plant, which provides maintenance and servicing to military aircraft at an air base from which Russian aircraft have operated Ms Truss said Belarus ""will be made to feel the economic consequences for its support for Putin"". ""We are inflicting economic pain on Putin and those closest to him. We will not rest until Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity is restored."" The UK says it has already imposed sanctions on more than 100 people and organisations in response to the ""fraudulent elections"" and ""human rights violations"" in Belarus. Suggesting further sanctions could be imposed on Belarus over the Ukraine invasion, the foreign secretary said ""nothing - and no one - is off the table"". Belarusian and Russian forces took part in joint military exercises in Belarus ahead of the invasion of Ukraine Tuesday's Belarus sanctions came as MPs approved new measures against Russia over its invasion of Ukraine. The package includes a full asset freeze for all Russian banks, as well as new powers to limit them from clearing payments in sterling. A ban has also been enacted on a range of exports critical to Russia's military and strategic interests. The sanctions are in alignment with the US, European Union and others to collectively cut off much of Russia's high-tech imports, the government said. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? Russians feel the pain of international sanctions The measures were announced by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who told the House of Commons last week they were ""the largest and most severe package of economic sanctions that Russia has ever seen"". Labour and Conservative MPs have called on the government to strengthen the sanctions regime in order to put further pressure on Russia. Labour shadow foreign minister Stephen Doughty urged ministers to ""go even faster and further"", warning in some cases the sanctions had been ""off the pace"" compared with the UK's allies. Conservative former cabinet minister David Davis said action was needed against the ""140 or so oligarchs"" identified as having ""direct links"" with President Putin.
