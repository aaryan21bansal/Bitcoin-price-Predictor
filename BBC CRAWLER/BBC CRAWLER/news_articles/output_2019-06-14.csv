The surprising benefits of talking to strangers,"Most people spend part of every day surrounded by strangers, whether on their daily commute, sitting in a park or cafe, or visiting the supermarket. Yet many of us remain in self-imposed isolation, believing that reaching out to a stranger would make you both feel uncomfortable. These beliefs may be unwarranted.  In fact,our research suggests,externalwe may often underestimate the positive impact of connecting with others for both our own and others' wellbeing. For example, having a conversation with a stranger on your way to work may leave you both feeling happier than you would think. We asked bus and train commuters in Chicago how they would feel about striking up a conversation on their morning commute, compared to sitting in solitude or doing whatever they normally do. Most thought that talking would lead to the least pleasant commute. However, when we actually carried out the experiment, those randomly assigned to talk had the most pleasant commute. Our commuters estimated that only about 40% of their fellow train passengers would be willing to talk to them. Yet every participant in our experiment who actually tried to talk to a stranger found the person sitting next to them was happy to chat. Thinking others aren't interested in talking, or won't like you, are the very things that will keep you from making contact. In fact, research suggests that weconsistently underestimate how much a new person likes us,externalfollowing an initial conversation. Separate experiments on buses and in taxis yielded similar results; individuals found connecting with strangers was surprisingly pleasant. The positive impact even seems to spread to the person you talk to.  In another experiment conducted in a waiting room, we found that not only did the people we encouraged to talk have a more pleasant experience, but so did the person they were asked to talk to. Of course, nobody appreciates unwanted attention. But simply reaching out to a fellow human being to say hello may be better received than people realise. Few start a conversation with a stranger, but most seem happy to talk if you reach out with good intentions. One reason may be that the experience of talking with others and hearing a stranger's voicemakes us realise they have a rich inner life,externalof thoughts, feelings, emotions, and experiences, just like us. These brief connections with strangers are not likely to turn a life of misery into one of bliss. However, they can change unpleasant moments - like the grind of a daily commute - into something more pleasant. Humans are inherently social animals, who are made happier and healthier when connected to others. Feeling isolated and lonely, in contrast, is a stress factor that poses a health riskcomparable to smoking and obesity,external. Having positive social relationships has been put forward as akey ingredient for happiness,external, more significant even thanhow much we earn,external. Professor Epley's team has replicated the Chicago experiment with nearly 700 rail commuters on Greater Anglia's lines into London for the BBC. He will offer early impressions of the results on Friday as part of Crossing Divides On the Move, a day when the BBC - working with transport companies - is encouraging adults to chat to fellow passengers. Initiatives include: Virgin Trains designating all coach Cs on its west coast services as the ""chat coach"" Arriva distributing ""conversation starter"" cards via its national bus network, and encouraging passengers to ""share a smile"" Encouraging people from different backgrounds to mix on Translink Northern Ireland's Glider service connecting East and West Belfast You might imagine that only outgoing people would benefit more from connecting with others. In fact, several experiments indicateboth extroverts and introverts are happier,externalwhen they are asked to behave in an extroverted manner. We found that commuters tend to be happier when they talk to a stranger, regardless of how extroverted they perceived themselves to be. Although personality may not have a big effect on your experience of connecting with others, it may affect your expectations, with introverts underestimating the positive consequences of interaction. Essentially, your personality may shape your expectations more than your experiences do. Our expectations can become self-fulfilling. If you think that talking to a stranger is likely to be unpleasant, you'll never try and so never discover that your expectations might be wrong. This can keep us mistakenly isolated and disconnected from others. This may help to explain why cities seem so crowded with highly social people who are actively trying to ignore each other. Strangers sit next to each other on park benches staring at their phones, walk down city streets without smiling or saying ""hello"" to anyone. More like this The friends who are good for your brain How much difference does going to a top US university make? Light mornings and the secret to a good night's sleep These misunderstandings extend beyond interaction on public transport to many areas of our lives, where we consistently underestimate the positive impact of reaching out to others in general. Those whowrite a thank-you letter,external, do random acts of kindness, or express compliments consistently, believe their recipient will be less happy than they actually are. Underestimating the positive impact of reaching out can keep us from being social enough for both our own, and others', wellbeing. Our findings do not suggest that you should talk to every person you see, or that you should engage with everyone who attempts to approach you. Instead, the next time you'd like to help a stranger with something, or strike up a conversation, but are worried about how they might react, simply give it a try. Our research suggests it's likely to go significantly better than you might expect, leaving both of you feeling happier and better connected.

'We caught a bus to stop feeling lonely',"This video can not be played Passengers chatting aboard a bus in Plymouth The BBC and public transport companies are encouraging people to try talking to their fellow passengers. It's part of Crossing Divides On the Move day, an initiative testing the theory that we benefit from talking to strangers. Former NHS nurse Kate Smith is a believer. ""When you look up and out, you see that there are some really nice people around,"" she says. ""And people actually care about who you are and what you've done today."" Kate co-founded Plymouth-based dementia charity Memory Matters. At the charity's city centre cafe she introduces us to Anne-Marie, Derek and Hazel. They've agreed to take part in our simple experiment: can a conversation on the bus make you feel happier and less lonely? The surprising benefits of talking to strangers About Crossing Divides On the Move Your stories of commuting conversations Joined by other volunteers, we climb on a double-decker in Plymouth and, at first, ask all our passengers to keep themselves to themselves. You can picture the scene: headphones in, eyes glued to phones and vacant gazes out of the window. Then we give our volunteers a simple task: talk to another passenger. The atmosphere immediately changes. ""It's the best bus I've been on"", laughs Anne-Marie. Anxiety means that she normally ""struggles talking to people"" and can feel very lonely in a crowded room. But on our chatty bus she doesn't feel isolated or alone. ""I just feel quite comfortable and there's a good energy around everyone,"" is the way 19-year-old Hazel puts it. And for Derek Perry, who describes loneliness as ""one of his worst illnesses"", the bus is a ""happy place"". ""We should look at different ideas of how we encourage people to talk to each other."" The enthusiasm is clear in his voice. Claire Haigh believes there is a ""loneliness epidemic"" in the UK. She heads the transport group Greener Journeys, a coalition including bus operators and passenger groups. Its polling data suggests that a third of people have caught a bus purely to have human contact. A bus driver, she says, can be the only person that someone communicates with throughout the course of an entire day. ""We need to find ways to create more cohesive communities,"" she argues. ""The bus can do that."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It is On the Move day, part of the BBC's Crossing Divides season about bringing people together in a fragmented world. With the help of transport companies, the BBC is encouraging as many people as possible on trains, trams and buses to interact with other passengers or staff. Initiatives include: Virgin Trains designating all coach Cs on its West Coast services as the ""chat coach"" Arriva distributing ""conversation starter"" cards on buses across the country, and encouraging passengers to ""share a smile"" encouraging people from different backgrounds to mix on Translink Northern Ireland's Glider service connecting East and West Belfast National Express deploying actors, poets and games to help trigger conversations on its route 11, which connects Birmingham's most affluent and deprived areas rail companies Greater Anglia and GTR are also taking part, along with Go Ahead buses and Transport for London The intention is to spark thousands of conversations and start a national conversation aimed at breaking down society's barriers and combating loneliness. Prof Nicholas Epley, a behavioural scientist at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, led research which suggestedcommuters had a ""significantly more positive journeywhen they connected with a stranger than when they sat in solitude"". He replicated the Chicago experiment with 477 rail commuters on Greater Anglia's lines into London for the BBC. ""The results were replicated almost exactly in terms of people's experiences,"" he said. ""The thing we are crystal clear on in our analysis is that the Brits in our experiment enjoyed talking to strangers just as our American participants did."" While accepting many people cherish solitude on their journeys, Crossing Divides season editor Emily Kasriel says On the Move day aims to create a greater sense of belonging and break down barriers in society. ""Contributing to social cohesion is part of the BBC's public purpose,"" she says, adding that participation ""should be fun and is, of course, voluntary."" It's not everybody's cup of tea. ""No thank you. My mornings are for drinking my coffee and listening to music,"" website reader Stephen Mortimer told the BBC. ""Thankfully big headphones generally signal to people that I'm not interested in a conversation."" Another, Vicente, wrote: ""I'm a Londoner. There are over eight million of us living here. I work in an open-plan office with constant interaction. Forgive me for valuing my downtime on public transport by burying my head in a book."" Allow Twitter content?

'I spend three hours a day on Facebook fighting hate',"This video can not be played Nina spends three hours a day on the #IAmHere project A network of tens of thousands of online volunteers is fighting hate speech on Facebook. They organise under the slogan ""#IAmHere"". It's 7:30 in Berlin, and Nina's alarm clock is going off. Before getting up and making breakfast for her 13-month-old daughter, who is sleeping in the next room, she reaches for her phone. Unlike many of us, Nina's not checking her emails, the news, or looking at gossip sites or posting photos. Instead, every day Nina opens up Facebook and heads straight to the closed group #IchBinHier (""#IAmHere""). Nina is part of an international movement working to find and combat hate speech on the platform. She and her fellow #IAmHere members spend their spare time scanning Facebook for conversations happening on big pages, often run by mainstream media organisations, which are overwhelmed with racist, misogynistic or homophobic comments. They don't attempt to change the minds of people posting hate or argue directly with extremists. Instead they collectively inject discussions with facts and straightforwardly argued reasonable viewpoints. The idea is to provide balance so that other social media users see that there are alternative perspectives beyond the ones offered up by the trolls. The volunteers also say they don't target conservative views or any other mainstream opinions. Instead #IAmHere activists - there are tens of thousands of them in groups across Europe and around the world - say their mission is to change the overall tone of online debate, counteract hate storms and make Facebook a nicer place overall. And the social media giant has picked up on the phenomenon. Facebook has provided #IAmHere groups with free advertising credits and helps them organise meet-ups as part of itsOnline Civil Courage Initiative,external. Nina, 39, says she spends around three hours a day moderating comments on top of her full-time job as director of an NGO. But she has very personal reasons for devoting a large chunk of her busy schedule to the campaign. Her husband is from Uganda, and she says they both have felt angry and scared by what they perceive as a rise in racist, anti-immigrant rhetoric on social media over the past few years. ""As a couple in this still very white Germany, we are exposed in a way,"" she says. ""I think our feeling that we have to change something got stronger. ""I cannot imagine [my daughter] growing up and reading all these things. I do not want this culture."" Nina with her Ugandan husband, who moved to Berlin in 2017 You may also be interested in: The lawyer who takes on Facebook over free speech 'I invested in Facebook â¦ now I am ashamed' Meet the people at America's political extremes Nina posted her first comment on behalf of the group in February 2017 after #IchBinHier was endorsed by a popular German TV presenter. ""My heart was beating a lot the first time I used the hashtagâ¦ It felt amazing to finally have a group behind me."" In Germany, Nina says articles about asylum seekers or climate change protests tend to attract a lot of anger. User comments include racial or ethnic slurs, or include violent images of guns or guillotines. Some comments and pictures can be much worse. Hear more on this story on the Trending podcast from the BBC World Service:Download now #IAmHere was founded in Sweden, where it is called #JagArHar, by Iranian-born journalist Mina Dennert. Around three years ago she says she noticed social media becoming, as she describes it, ""flooded with hatred"", so she began trying to counter misogynistic and racist comments ""in a calm, non-aggressive way"". ""I've experienced so much racism throughout my life, I wasn't scared to do this,"" she adds. Mina Dennert founded the #IAmHere movement in Sweden After a while working mainly on her own, Dennert figured she could make more impact with a group behind her: ""I reached out to get other people involved. A lot of them were like, 'This is fantastic, I've been feeling so alone with this.'"" Media attention soon followed and the Swedish group grew to 75,000 members. As word spread, similar groups began popping up in other countries including Italy, France, Slovakia, Poland and the UK. Today, there are 14 different #IAmHere groups working towards the same goals in their respective languages. The groups stick to fighting hate speech, which Facebook defines as a ""direct attack on people based on protected characteristics - race, ethnicity, national origin, religious affiliation, sexual orientation, caste, sex, gender, gender identity, and serious disease or disability."" The German group, #IchBinHier, was founded by marketing consultant Hannes Ley. It currently has 45,000 members. ""I had some Swedish friends come to stay in December 2016,"" he explains. ""I came into the kitchen one morning and one of them was posting comments on Facebook. I asked what he was doing."" Ley says he had ""a really positive gut feeling"" the minute his friend explained the concept. ""I was reading comments for many years and I felt rather helpless because of the quantity of hate speech. I thought, OK, we can try to make another majority to confront the hate speech crowd."" Ley says the group is welcoming of diverse political views. ""The majority of our members are left and liberal and we have some conservative members,"" he says. ""We have to tolerate different opinions in a democracy. But if it becomes aggressive, if it becomes violent, this is where #IchBinHier interrupts."" Hannes Ley founded the German branch of the group As the German group grew, some members became curious about the commenters they were interacting with. ""I was very astonished by the number of likes some comments were getting, ones that would really vilify migrants,"" says Philip Kreissel, a 23-year-old political science student and #IchBinHier volunteer. Intrigued to see whether he could find some kind of organised activity taking place, he began doing data analysis. ""I found that some of these accounts were really [very] active and were 'liking' all day, and this created a bias in social media."" Further digging made it clear that many users creating and liking hateful comments were just as organised and targeted as #IAmHere. Researcher Jacob Davey, an expert on the far right at the London-based Institute of Strategic Dialogue (ISD), says: ""Troll armies bring themselves together in almost semi-military style hierarchies. ""You can see these groups coming together and engaging in harassment on Facebook, which appears to be both silencing moderate discussion and dominating certain discussion points."" Going up against these troll armies does not come without risks. ""2018 was an election year in Sweden and they started making up the craziest stuff about us, that we were weapons dealers or supporting terrorists,"" says Dennert. Members of the Swedish group were doxxed - they had their personal information posted online. Dennert, her husband and two children requested police protection after the threats got particularly vicious. In Berlin, Nina has also been subject to intimidation. ""One troll mentioned my child, as he saw on my work's website I was on parental leave. That really creeped me out, and I thought for a moment 'Should I be doing this?'"" She admits that being confronted with hateful comments on a daily basis can take a toll on members' mental health. ""It depends on my daily mood,"" she says. ""Some days I can take so much I amaze myself. Others, I feel my skin is very thin."" Facebook has provided the volunteers with free ad credits and support in organising meet-ups. Despite being grateful for the help, many #IAmHere members believe the platform should do more to combat hate speech. Ley says Facebook needs to ""live up to its own community standards"" and be quicker at deleting comments. In a statement, Facebook says it uses a mix of proactive technology and human moderation, and that its efforts to tackle hate speech have improved. For instance, the company says it has banned more than 200 white supremacist organisations. Starting in 2018, Germany's NetzDG law required social media sites to remove hate speech within a day of it being reported, and analysis shows that explicitly racist posts have decreased on Facebook since then. A study of #IchBinHier activity by researchers at the University of Dusseldorf also found that its commenters are often successful at changing the tone of online debates. Will Germany's new law kill free speech online? On the other hand, research carried out by Kreissel and the ISD found that coordinated right-wing extremist online hate campaigns have increased three-fold since December 2017. ""I don't see it getting better, I see it getting worse,"" says Nina. She says she often feels ""hopeless"" when confronted with the daily barrage of hate, and she believes ""what we say online will affect our offline actions eventually"". But this is another reason she keeps going. ""I think it's made me more courageous in offline situations,"" she says. ""Recently, two men were shouting at each other on the subway and I just got in between them and said, 'What are you doing?' ""It equips me for being with my daughter in this world - if someone makes a comment on how she looks, I'm fast to react. ""It's in meâ¦ It's part of my life.""

Second home ownership soaring,"The number of British people who own a second home, buy-to-let or overseas property has doubled since 2001, says think tank the Resolution Foundation. While the number of millennials who own a home continues to fall, one in 10 people now own an additional property. Just 37% of people born in the 1980s managed to buy a home at the age of 29, compared with half of those born in the 1960s. Wealth from owning a second home has risen since 2001 to almost Â£1 trillion. Buy-to-let property is now the most common form of property wealth, having grown by 58% since 2006-08, the report found. However, when looking at the number of people who can afford an additional property, millennials match the property ownership rates of other generations. This suggests that only younger people who are rich can afford a second home - a sign, according to the foundation, that property wealth is not distributed fairly across the country. The Resolution Foundation wants to see policymakers step in to reform the housing market, in particular buy-to-let, in order to rebalance the housing market back towards first-time buyers. ""The sheer scale of additional property wealth is an important driver of rising wealth gaps across Britain,"" says George Bangham, policy analyst at the Resolution Foundation. ""While young people in particular are less likely to own their own home than previous generations, those that do own are more likely to have more than one property. ""And as the huge stock of second homes, buy-to-let and overseas properties starts to be passed on to younger generations, Britain risks becoming a country where getting ahead in life depends as much on what you inherit, as what you earn."" Chris Norris, director of policy and practice at the National Landlords Association, defended second home owners. ""There is a distinct difference between those who have a second home for personal use, leaving it empty for long periods of time, and those who have invested in a rental property which provides a valued home for someone else,"" he said. ""Far from the stereotype of the wealthy property baron, most private landlords invest in residential property to provide for their future and their family's in the form of supplementing a pension or establishing a business."" Meanwhile, the government said it was helping first-time buyers get on the housing ladder. ""The Government is determined to ensure that a new generation can realise the dream of homeownership,"" a spokesman said. ""Last year saw the highest number of first-time buyers in more than a decade. Since 2015, we have helped more than 300,000 people to purchase a home through schemes such as Help to Buy.""

Sinha, a former GP, said he was told he had Parkinson's - a degenerative brain condition - last month. He said it had been ""a really, really tough two weeks"" but said he did not ""consider himself unlucky"". ""Whatever the next stage of my life holds for me, many others have it far worse,"" he continued. Sinha said he intended to ""keep Chasing, keep writing and performing comedy [and] keep quizzing"" while joking that appearing on Dancing on Ice was probably ""out of the question"".

Johnson to take part in BBC TV debate,"This video can not be played Johnson: I want grown-up discussion Boris Johnson has said he will take part in Tuesday's televised Tory leadership debate on the BBC. The frontrunner in the contest to replace Theresa May said the programme, which will be shown after the second round of MPs' voting, was the right forum to debate the big issues. Rival candidates have accused Mr Johnson of avoiding media scrutiny. He said he was ""very keen"" on TV debates but viewers might not like too much ""blue-on-blue action"". Mr Johnson, however, will not be taking part in Sunday's debate on Channel 4, with his team reportedly having reservations about its proposed format. Matt Hancock quits Tory leadership contest Johnson's success leaves him vulnerable The other five candidates still in the race become Tory leader and prime minister - Jeremy Hunt, Michael Gove, Sajid Javid, Rory Stewart and Dominic Raab - have urged Mr Johnson to take part in every TV debate. They say the next prime minister should be subjected to the fullest possible scrutiny. Mr Johnson, a former Foreign Secretary, won the first Tory MPs' ballot for the contest on Thursday with 114 votes, with his nearest rival - Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt - getting 43. He told the BBC Radio 4's World at One he had done many TV debates during his two successful London mayoral campaigns and he was ""pretty bewildered"" by claims he was dodging scrutiny. ""I think it is important that we have a sensible, grown-up debate,"" he said, ahead of next week's BBC event. ""My own observation is that in the past when you've had loads of candidates, it can be slightly cacophonous and I think the public have had quite a lot of blue-on-blue action, frankly, over the last three years."" He added: ""We don't necessarily need a lot more of that, and so what I think the best solution would be would be to have a debate on what we all have to offer the country. ""The best time to do that, I think, would be after the second ballot on Tuesday and the best forum is the proposed BBC debate. I think that's a good idea."" In a wide-ranging interview, Mr Johnson defended his record as foreign secretary and said the UK must step up preparations for a no-deal Brexit as a way of getting an improved deal. He said it was ""perfectly realistic"" to renegotiate the withdrawal deal and leave the EU by the end of October, adding that the ""fundamental flaw"" in Theresa May's Withdrawal Agreement was theIrish border ""backstop""and a solution was possible.

""That's not to say that I don't think there will be some difficulties that need to be addressed and we must make sure that we can address them."" Asked when he last took cocaine, he replied that there had been ""a single inconclusive event that took place when I was a teenager"" and never since then. He said those who criticised his handling, as foreign secretary, of the case ofNazanin Zaghari-Ratcliffe, a British-Iranian woman who is imprisoned in Iran was ""unintentionally exculpating the people who are really responsible and that is the Iranian Revolutionary Guard"".

Police take no action over Brand acid joke,"Jo Brand said the joke was ""crass and ill-judged"" The Metropolitan Police has said it will take no further action over Jo Brand's comments on a radio show about throwing battery acid at politicians. The comedian was accused of inciting violence after joking on BBC Radio 4's Heresy about throwing acid instead of milkshakes at ""unpleasant characters"". She later apologised for whatshe called a ""crass and ill-judged"" joke,external. The show's creator, David Baddiel, said the BBC was ""cowardly"" forremoving the joke from a repeat of the episode. Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage, who had milkshake thrown over him during the European election campaign in May, has accused Brand of inciting violence, although he did not say who against. Writing on Twitter, he added: ""I am sick to death of overpaid, left-wing, so-called comedians on the BBC who think their view is morally superior. Can you imagine the reaction if I had said the same thing as Jo Brand?"" In the episode of theHeresybroadcast on Tuesday, Brand told presenter Victoria Coren Mitchell that people who attacked ""unpleasant figures"" with milkshakes were ""pathetic"", adding: ""Why bother with a milkshake when you could get some battery acid?"" The comic then went on to immediately make clear she was joking and criticised the milkshake stunts. ""I'm not going to do it,"" she said. ""It's purely a fantasy, but I think milkshakes are pathetic, I honestly do, sorry."" Her follow-up comments were edited out of widely-shared clips on social media. Ofcom said it received 65 complaints about the episode.

She added: ""Nigel Farage tweeted the first bit that I said without the second bit when I apologised and said it was a joke and not something I would encourage.

London attacker was 60cm from armed officer,"Youssef Zaghba, armed with a knife, charged at a firearms officer before being shot dead One of the London Bridge attackers was less than 60cm (23in) away from an armed police officer when he was shot dead, an inquest has heard. Det Supt Rebecca Riggs said forensic evidence suggested how close knifeman Youssef Zaghba had been to an officer. Zaghba and two others left eight people dead and 48 injured when they drove a van into pedestrians and stabbed people in Borough Market on 3 June 2017. Det Supt Riggs was giving evidence at inquests into the victims' deaths. The Old Bailey had heard previously that Zaghba, armed with a knife, had charged at the firearms officer and was within touching distance when the officer opened fire. Det Supt Riggs, who was in charge of the Metropolitan Police investigation into the attacks, said eight armed officers fired a total of 46 shots at the three attackers. The armed officers who killed the knifemen have not been named at the inquest Zaghba's accomplices Khuram Butt, 27, and Rachid Redouane, 30, were struck by at least six bullets each, the court heard. Det Supt Riggs said Zaghba, 22, was hit at least twice. London Bridge: MI5 'missed chances due to errors' Bullet 'centimetres' from witness Summarising evidence that had already been heard in court, Det Supt Riggs confirmed that at 22:23 BST - seven minutes after the initial volley of shots - officers opened fire again on Butt and Redouane. They were thought to be still moving and wearing explosive vests, which were later revealed to be fake. The victims of the London Bridge attack (clockwise from top left): Christine Archibald, Sebastien Belanger, Kirsty Boden, Ignacio Echeverria, Sara Zelenak, Xavier Thomas, Alexandre Pigeard, James McMullan Det Supt Riggs said officers fired twice more at Butt at 22:29 and 22:31. Another senior officer told the court back-up firearms officers then had to be drafted in. City of London Police temporary commander David Evans - the force's most senior officer on duty on the night of the attacks - described the police control room as ""exceptionally busy"" even after the trio were shot, and said he experienced ""information overload"". ""It continued to be a very confusing period, with reports of potentially linked incidents, so part of my responsibility now that firearms officers were engaged in a post-incident process was to have firearms cover,"" he said. Xavier Thomas, 45, Chrissy Archibald, 30, Sara Zelenak, 21, Sebastien Belanger, 36, James McMullan, 32, Kirsty Boden, 28, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, and Ignacio Echeverria, 39, were killed by the attackers. London Bridge attack: What happened Victims of the London Bridge attack Det Supt Riggs said 124 crime scenes were processed, almost 6,100 exhibits seized and 22 addresses searched in the subsequent investigation. The court heard 22 people were arrested but released without charge. When Jonathan Hough QC, counsel to the inquests, asked Det Supt Riggs if there was anything to suggest the attack had been directed from overseas, or by a wider network, she said: ""No, there was no evidence of that."" She admitted the phones used by the three knifemen in the build-up to the attack were never recovered. Mr Hough said the weapon taken from Butt had DNA on it thought to relate to Mr Pigeard and DNA traces thought to relate to Ms Zelenak and Mr Belanger - as well as traces thought to be Zaghba's. A knife found next to Zaghba had DNA thought to relate to Ms Boden and Mr Belanger, Mr Hough said. The knife attached to Redouane's wrist also had DNA linked to Mr Belanger and Mr Echeverria and DNA thought to relate to Ms Zelenak, the court heard. The inquests continue.

'Girl gang' student attack pair sentenced,"Mariam Moustafa had a stroke and died in hospital a month after the attack Two members of a girl gang who attacked a student at a bus stop in a row over a boy have been sentenced. Mariam Moustafa, 18, fell into a coma after she was punched several times by a ""pack"" of assailants last February. She died of a stroke a month later, but pathologists could not legally link the attack with her death, Nottingham Crown Court heard. Mariah Fraser, 20, was given an eight-month sentence and Britania Hunter, 18, given a 12-month community order. Both previously admitted affray. A third accused, a 16-year-old girl who cannot be named and also pleaded guilty, was remanded back to the youth court for sentencing. Six female defendants were charged after Miss Moustafa, an engineering student, was attacked in Nottingham city centre while one of her friends tried to protect her. They included three other teenage girls aged 18, 17 and 16, who will be sentenced later this month. During sentencing, Nottingham Crown Court heardthe attack was ""fuelled by social media"". Fraser (left), Hunter (right) and four teenagers admitted carrying out the attack Opening the facts of the case on Thursday, prosecutor Luke Blackburn said the six were not charged with manslaughter because pathologists could not legally link the attack to Miss Moustafa's death. The hearing was told Fraser and Hunter were part of a group who filmed the attack on Miss Moustafa and watched as two others, aged 16 and 18, hit her. Latest news and stories from the East Midlands Mr Blackburn said footage showed Miss Moustafa, an Egyptian national, looking ""frightened, passive and, towards the end, obviously unwell"". Judge Gregory Dickinson QC called the defendants aggressive and cowardly and said: ""This was not an attack motivated by hostility to race or religion. It was to do with a boy."" Mohamed Moustafa said he was not informed of a court hearing in April where the three admitted affray Ch Supt Rob Griffin said: ""These girls showed persistent aggression towards Mariam and what was even more disgusting was that there was filming of what happened and this footage was shared on social media."" Miss Moustafa's father, Mohamed Moustafa,said the family had not been informed about a hearingin April where Fraser, Hunter and the 16-year-old admitted affray a week before their trial. The Crown Prosecution Service subsequently apologised. After the sentencing, he said his family ""are not safe in this country"". ""I have been doing my best for all of my family - telling them to keep safe, don't do anything wrong in this country, don't attack anyone, but after court today... nobody can protect my family,"" he said.

"University faces 'financial uncertainties'As a university looks at 110 job cuts, its accounts reveal financial difficulties.Wales","Developments have included a new home for the Faculty of Architecture, Computing and Engineering (Face) on Swansea waterfront University of Wales Trinity Saint David is facing financial uncertainty that could cast ""significant doubt"" over future operations. Its latest accounts said it might not have enough cash to continue as a going concern if some key sources of income did not materialise. UWTSD said the risk was remote and it had acted to secure its ""resilience"". It confirmed it was looking at 110 possible job cuts and had nearly completed a process to save Â£6.5m. The university has received 94 applications for voluntary redundancy and made 16 compulsory redundancies, but said it was working with staff and unions to reduce the need for the latter. UWTSD is based across three locations in west Wales - Lampeter, Carmarthen and Swansea - and employs 1,500 people. It had more than 10,000 students in 2017-18. Academic brands Wales' university mergers 'disgraceful' Swansea waterfront campus plan for university A new library is part of the waterfront developments Its latest accounts showed a Â£30m HSBC bank loan, forits development on Swansea's waterfront, had to be rearranged because it breached one of the conditions. They warned there was uncertainty over four expected sources of income - if a combination of them do not materialise, it could give rise to a ""material uncertainty"" over whether the university will have enough cash. The accounts - for the year to July 2018 - were not finalised until April 2019, said these were: A large grant towards the cost of a property development was expected in 2018 but had been delayed A sale of a property, subject to planning permission, had also been delayed Final savings from a restructuring process were not yet known Uncertainties, experienced by all universities, about student enrolment and retention No other Welsh universities have included a similar statement in the audit report in their accounts in recent years, according to higher education finance officials. A UWTSD spokeswoman said there was no ""significant doubt"" and the university was ""responding to a risk"". She said: ""The current uncertainty the university is facing is linked to the timing of it receiving grants. This is a holding issue that the university is dealing with. ""In line with good governance the university has identified the risk, as it is required to do in its financial accounts, and is managing it. The university's future is not uncertain.""

The teenager who was forgotten for 17 years,"Margaret Fleming pictured on a college night out Margaret Fleming was a vulnerable young woman who vanished without trace - and no-one raised the alarm for almost 17 years. She was 19 years old when she was last seen by anyone other than Edward Cairney and Avril Jones. Her disappearance was so mysterious that at one point police asked the couple, who were meant to be Margaret's carers, if she even existed. Their version of her life was stranger than fiction. This video can not be played The wild claims made by Margaret Fleming's killers They claimed that Margaret, who had learning difficulties, ran off with a traveller, then went on to become a gangmaster who travelled Europe, and a drug dealer with several aliases. Precisely what happened may never be known, but a jury found the pairguilty of murdering Margaretwithin three weeks of that final sighting on 17 December 1999. Her body has never been found. During the seven-week trial, the prosecution painted a bleak picture of Margaret's life before she disappeared. An only child, she was brought up in the town of Port Glasgow, Inverclyde, and faced challenges from an early age. At Slaemuir Primary School, Margaret struggled with reading and writing, and she continued to require additional support as a pupil at Port Glasgow High. But two defining events ultimately led her into the care of her killers. Margaret was described as a quiet figure at school In January 1993, her parents Derek and Margaret divorced after 20 years of marriage. The schoolgirl was 12 when she left the family home to move in with her father and grandparents. The jury heard Margaret had a bad temper and was described by her mother as difficult to handle. In contrast, she was a quiet figure in the classroom and required constant encouragement. In a 1995 report, teacher Elizabeth Brown wrote: ""Margaret Fleming has moderate learning difficulties. She works fairly well to her ability but needs written instructions set out simply and gone over verbally."" In evidence she said: ""If you left Margaret on her own she would do very little. You had to prod her to do the work. Her marks were all at the very bottom end of the school."" On one rare occasion another teacher put on record her gratitude to the teenager for helping her with registration. Margaret Fleming pictured with Avril Jones This provided one of the most poignant moments of the trial at the High Court in Glasgow. Ms Brown recalled: ""She clearly thought Margaret deserved a letter of praise, which Margaret wouldn't have got many of during her schooling."" Another retired teacher, Elaine Moore, said: ""She was quite isolated. Her and her dad were a wee unit. She was concerned about him and he was concerned about her."" Mr Fleming, a tradesman who retrained as a lawyer, was so protective of his daughter he didn't tell her why he had been taken in to hospital. He had been diagnosed with terminal cancer. His condition had deteriorated by 20 October 1995, when his ex-wife took Margaret to Inverclyde Council's social work office. The meeting was arranged to discuss her behavioural problems, which included arguing with her grandparents. The referral said: ""Margaret does not know why her father is in hospital and is afraid it is something serious."" Margaret with Cairney and Jones It also noted the child was always with her father and felt ""rejected"" by her mother. The report continued: ""I feel like Margaret is a rather lonely, isolated girl who is living with elderly grandparents. ""Margaret appears to be surrounded by a great deal of uncertainty and ill health."" Five days after the meeting, Mr Fleming lost his battle with cancer. His death not only devastated Margaret but proved to be the catalyst for her eventual move from Port Glasgow to Inverkip, 10 miles along the Clyde coast. The couple's Seacroft home sits on the banks of the Firth of Clyde Mr Fleming thought that his parents were too old to take care of his daughter. He had earlier told his fiancÃ©e Jean McSherry that if anything happened to him, Eddie and Avril would look after Margaret. During the trial Margaret's mother, 71-year-old Margaret Cruickshanks, recalled how she first met Cairney. She said: ""After Derek died they were at the funeral. Eddie Cairney came and approached me and said if I needed any help with Margaret he would give me respite care."" Eddie Cairney had offered to help with respite for Margaret The court heard Margaret initially lived with her mother but later spent up to a fortnight at a time staying with Cairney and Jones at their dilapidated home, which was named Seacroft. Ms Cruickshanks said her daughter was even more difficult to cope with after the loss of her father. She added: ""She would come back from school and I'd say: 'What were you doing?' ""Her temper would be up and she would batter me."" A month after Mr Fleming's death, Margaret and her mother met Inverclyde Councilsocial worker Denise Munroin a bid to secure support from the additional needs team. Ms Munro recalled: ""She was quite a naÃ¯ve girl, quite vulnerable, quiet, lonely, sad and did not have many friends."" She said there had been a strained relationship between mother and daughter. Giving evidence, she added: ""When I went to their house to pick up Margaret I would have a conversation with her mum, who found it difficult. ""She had lived on her own and had an adolescent girl who was missing her dad."" The back garden of Seacroft, where Margaret lived with Cairney and Jones Ms Munro continued to support the teenager until she went on maternity leave in July 1996. By this time, Margaret had enrolled on a skills for life course at James Watt College in Greenock and appeared to have settled down. But that August, Ms Cruickshanks told the social work department that her daughter's behaviour had deteriorated. But she received no further support and no-one stepped into Ms Munro's role. The living room of the house in Inverkip All ties between mother and daughter were finally severed after achilling confrontationon 26 November, 1997. Ms Cruickshanks told the jury she was attacked by Cairney after travelling to Inverkip to tell him she wanted her daughter to come home. She said Margaret, who struggled with her weight, was then brought downstairs from her attic bedroom and asked where she wanted to live. Ms Cruickshanks said: ""I think she was a bit nervous and she turned round and said she wanted to stay there. There was nothing I could do about it."" She later called the police who went to check on Margaret. Memories of that night reduced her to tears in the witness box as she recalled: ""The police came back to say she was alright. As far as I knew that was where she was living. ""I didn't visit any more. I got a letter. It said she didn't want to see me any more."" In the months that followed, Margaret became more reclusive and Cairney told the jury he tried to stop the teenager self-harming by putting cardboard tubes on her arms. In October 1999, Margaret saw her GP, Dr James Farrell, for the last time. He told the court she had ""quite significant learning difficulties"" and said she might have hadSotos syndrome,externalfrom birth - although a definitive diagnosis of the rare disorder was never made. The GP also said she was ""socially and educationally"" isolated and referred her to a psychologist. Dr Alan Smith visited Seacroft before Christmas but all attempts to contact Margaret to arrange another appointment came to nothing. The three-week timeframe during which detectives believe Margaret was murdered was narrowed down by the testimony of Avril Jones' brother, Richard, and mother, Florence. Thelast confirmed sightingof Margaret was at Richard Jones' new home in Inverkip on 17 December 1999. Florence Jones remembered Margaret as a ""very, very quiet girl"" who was unable to look after herself due to her learning difficulties. The 79-year-old played a key role in the chronology of the case. The last known photograph of Margaret was taken in March 1999 Her most recent memory of Margaret was at her ruby wedding celebrations in March 1999, and a photograph from that night is the last known image of the teenager. Crucially, Mrs Jones had no recollection of Margaret joining the family at Mr Jones' house for Christmas dinner in 1999. There was also no sign of her in the photos taken that day. On 5 January, 2000 Mrs Jones spoke to her daughter on the phone. The pensioner told the court: ""She said Margaret had left with a traveller. I wasn't sure what had happened. It was up to them."" As the months turned to years, memories faded and not one person saw fit to report that a teenage girl had simply disappeared off the face of the earth. Indeed it was not until October 2016 that a missed appointment for a benefits review finally led police to Seacroft. The couple produced letters which they claimed had been written by Margaret The couple's attempts to cover their tracks, while Avril Jones fraudulently claimed Â£182,000 in benefits, included producing letters which were said to be from Margaret. One was said to be from Carlisle on 9 January 2000 and the other two were from the Regent Palace Hotel in Piccadilly Circus, London, on 13 January, 2000. As part of the complex investigation that followed detectives showed the typed letters to Jacqueline Cahill, whotaught Margaret standard grade Englishat Port Glasgow High between 1994 and 1996. She told the court the teenager would not have been capable of writing them. Ms Cahill said: ""She had literacy difficulties. ""She struggled to put pen to paper. She struggled to read, and read at about the level of an eight-year-old."" This video can not be played Jacqueline Cahill recalls her memories of Margaret Fleming But despite her struggles in the classroom, the teacher told BBC Scotland Margaret had the potential to hold down a job that did not require some numeracy and literacy skills. She added: ""If she had stayed in Port Glasgow, she would have stayed in touch with her friends, but moving to Inverkip probably made it easier for Margaret to slip off the radar. ""I don't even want to imagine what her life was like when she was living in Inverkip."" The teenager's life and death has had a profound impact on Ms Cahill. She said: ""There isn't anyone who remembers Margaret. ""I taught her for two years and I am here speaking about her as a person and I am one of the only people who remembers her. ""That is one of the saddest things that this wee girl was forgotten - abandoned with supposed carers, and forgotten about for 20 years.""

The day I interviewed Margaret's killers,"This video can not be played The wild claims made by Margaret Fleming's killers It was a grey day in November 2016 when I answered a call from my newsdesk. As a duty reporter I could be assigned anything, and on this particular day I was asked to look into a missing person's case. That wasn't unusual, but as the story unfolded it became the most incredible I'd worked on. Along with a cameraman, I headed to the coastal village of Inverkip where police were appealing for information about Margaret Fleming. She was a young woman who hadn't been seen for 17 years by anyone other than her carers, Eddie Cairney and Avril Jones. Margaret Fleming was last seen when she was 19 From December 1999 there had been no record of Margaret having seen a doctor, she had never used a bank account and there was no evidence she was on social media. In my career as a reporter, I've done several missing persons cases - but none that sounded like this. How could someone be alive but live undetected for all that time? I followed the story in the months that passed and despite several appeals by Police Scotland there remained no sight nor sound of Margaret. Then in October 2017 - almost a year on from the reported disappearance - I was handed an opportunity to interview Cairney and Jones at Seacroft, the home they had shared with Margaret. It is understood Margaret Fleming had lived in the Inverkip house since 1999 The day was as extraordinary as the case itself. The house was in a stunning location, looking out to the Firth of Clyde. The property appeared derelict from the outside, but inside it was worse. For me and cameraman Stan Leech, the first thing to hit us was the terrible smell. The floorboards creaked, plaster was coming off the ceiling and in the back room there was a huge hole in the house with only tarpaulin between the garden and the interior. I can't imagine how cold winter must have been. There was a tarpaulin over a hole in the back of the house Jones was quiet and said she wasn't feeling well. Cairney was very talkative, bullish even. He appeared outraged that police seemed to be treating them as suspects. The interview began with that standard question - how do you feel? And what came back was an unsurprising answer: ""We're upset at the way we've been treated, we feel like suspects, the last year has been hell."" But then the conversation took an incredible turn. My next question, asking whether the pair had heard from Margaret, prompted the reply: ""Oh yes, she's alive and working as a gangmaster in Poland."" Do you mean she's working under a gangmaster? I asked. ""No, no - she is the gangmaster,"" came the reply. Now, this was a woman whose learning difficulties were so complex she couldn't manage her financial affairs. Some of the things Cairney said about Margaret were unrepeatable, unkind and distasteful. But the most telling moment was when I asked Jones what she would like to say to Margaret if she was watching now? This is a question I ask in a lot of missing persons cases, as interviewees are nervous and getting them to describe a loved one is straightforward and puts them at ease. Jones was silent - not a word passed her lips. Eventually, the interview was over and we packed up our kit and left the house. As we drove onto the A78 back to the office, I asked Stan what he thought. ""Well, that was strange,"" he replied. We both agreed it was one of the most bizarre days we'd had at work. Did we believe them? Some of it yes - some of it no. Cairney said he'd been a deep sea diver, and that seems undisputed. But when he said he'd spoken to Margaret recently and I asked if he'd told the police, he insisted that they weren't interested. To me, that just wasn't credible. The interview was broadcast the following day and not long after that, Cairney and Jones were arrested. The next time I saw them in the flesh they were in the dock at the High Court in Glasgow and I was in the witness box. I was called by the prosecution to give evidence during their trial and I looked on as my interview was played for the jury. It was an uncomfortable experience for a reporter who is used to sitting in the press gallery. It was hard to look at them, but I did steal a peek at one point. Cairney looked very frail and Jones looked far away, as if she was disconnected from events. Now they stand convicted of Margaret's murder. The jury clearly did not believe their version of events. The police and prosecutors have done their job.  Justice has been served for her family. But one question remains - where is Margaret Fleming's body?

Firefighter gets ÃÂ£1.5m after losing hand,"This video can not be played 'One tiny wound cost me my whole hand' A firefighter whose hand was amputated after he was injured by faulty cutting gear has received Â£1.5m in damages. Ian McDonald, 37, was taking part in a training exercise in March 2014 when his hand was pierced by a high-pressure jet of hydraulic fluid. He had 40 operations after the toxic liquid destroyed the tissue in his right hand but after a four-year battle doctors were forced to amputate. The fire service said it had taken steps to prevent similar incidents. Ian with his daughter Ava before the accident Mr McDonald was injured during an exercise at Bishopbriggs fire station, in East Dunbartonshire, which was simulating rescuing a casualty from a car accident using hydraulic cutting equipment. It was only later that day he noticed his hand starting to swell and he began to feel a burning sensation. There was a small puncture wound through the side of his hand. The fluid got into Ian's hand through a small puncture wound ""One of my colleagues looked at the glove I had been wearing at the time and there was a hole straight through it,"" Mr McDonald, who is from Bishopbriggs, said. ""This started alarm bells ringing that this was a serious consideration."" He was taken to hospital and an X-ray showed oil inside his hand. It later emerged the hose pipe connecting the generator to the cutting gear, which pumps an internal fluid up to 850 Bars of pressure, was riddled with tiny punctures which can appear over time after being dragged over broken glass or metal shards at the scene of an incident. Ian McDonald said the past five years had been very difficult emotionally and physically One of these punctures caused a fine jet of hydraulic fluid to escape and pierce Mr McDonald's leather safety gloves. Over the next four years, he was in chronic pain and suffering repeated infections as doctors battled to keep his hand working. ""The doctors were doing everything they could to save my hand but at one point I lost one of my fingers, then another finger. ""They were using grafts from my leg to save what they had but it became apparent during last year that it was just beyond repair."" His hand was finally amputated in June 2018. ""It was a big thing but I didn't really see there was any other route to go down,"" he said. ""I'd already lost my hand by that point in a sense. ""When it was actually physically removed it was no great loss compared to what I'd already been going through."" Ian with his four children and his wife Claire In January, the father-of-four was fitted with a prosthetic hand which he says has given him a lot more independence. ""It allows me to do things for myself and not ask for help and gives me a bit more confidence,"" he said. He now has the dexterity to tie his own shoelaces and can help in the kitchen to a ""limited"" degree. Looking back on the past five years, Mr McDonald said it had been ""very difficult"" emotionally and physically but he thanked his wife Claire for helping him get through. ""At times it was frustrating, knowing it was going on for so long and not making any progress,"" he said. ""Physically, it has really taken its toll. I think I had 40 operations in total, each one under general anaesthetic. I also had skin grafts taken from other parts of my body, from my leg three times, and transplanted on to my hand and my arm. ""The medication I was on was really energy-sapping. It's been a tough time."" He said the amputation had been ""an overnight cure"" for his pain and suffering. ""The pain has gone away and the function is improving with the prosthetic device and it is just allowing me to get back to normal as much as I can,"" he said. Ian says his prosthetic hand has helped his independence and confidence An investigation into the incident by Digby Brown Solicitors revealed there was an inadequate system of inspection and maintenance for equipment despite the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service knowing about the risks. There were also protective coverings for the hose which would have prevented Ian's injury but they were not used. Solicitor David Nellaney said: ""The SFRS is undoubtedly a safety-conscious organisation that provides an invaluable service but on this occasion it failed in its duty of care to an employee. ""No settlement can alter the past, but it can improve the future and in Ian's case, it will provide access to ongoing medical treatment and ease the financial implications of this workplace injury."" Scottish Fire and Rescue's David McGown said he was heartened to see Mr McDonald make a strong recovery. He said: ""Following a robust investigation into Mr McDonald's injury, we undertook a review of equipment and related safety checks and have taken appropriate steps to minimise the risk of similar incidents happening in the future.""

"London attacker was 60cm from armed officerForensic evidence shows how close Youssef Zaghba was to a firearms officer, a senior officer says.UK","Youssef Zaghba, armed with a knife, charged at a firearms officer before being shot dead One of the London Bridge attackers was less than 60cm (23in) away from an armed police officer when he was shot dead, an inquest has heard. Det Supt Rebecca Riggs said forensic evidence suggested how close knifeman Youssef Zaghba had been to an officer. Zaghba and two others left eight people dead and 48 injured when they drove a van into pedestrians and stabbed people in Borough Market on 3 June 2017. Det Supt Riggs was giving evidence at inquests into the victims' deaths. The Old Bailey had heard previously that Zaghba, armed with a knife, had charged at the firearms officer and was within touching distance when the officer opened fire. Det Supt Riggs, who was in charge of the Metropolitan Police investigation into the attacks, said eight armed officers fired a total of 46 shots at the three attackers. The armed officers who killed the knifemen have not been named at the inquest Zaghba's accomplices Khuram Butt, 27, and Rachid Redouane, 30, were struck by at least six bullets each, the court heard. Det Supt Riggs said Zaghba, 22, was hit at least twice. London Bridge: MI5 'missed chances due to errors' Bullet 'centimetres' from witness Summarising evidence that had already been heard in court, Det Supt Riggs confirmed that at 22:23 BST - seven minutes after the initial volley of shots - officers opened fire again on Butt and Redouane. They were thought to be still moving and wearing explosive vests, which were later revealed to be fake. The victims of the London Bridge attack (clockwise from top left): Christine Archibald, Sebastien Belanger, Kirsty Boden, Ignacio Echeverria, Sara Zelenak, Xavier Thomas, Alexandre Pigeard, James McMullan Det Supt Riggs said officers fired twice more at Butt at 22:29 and 22:31. Another senior officer told the court back-up firearms officers then had to be drafted in. City of London Police temporary commander David Evans - the force's most senior officer on duty on the night of the attacks - described the police control room as ""exceptionally busy"" even after the trio were shot, and said he experienced ""information overload"". ""It continued to be a very confusing period, with reports of potentially linked incidents, so part of my responsibility now that firearms officers were engaged in a post-incident process was to have firearms cover,"" he said. Xavier Thomas, 45, Chrissy Archibald, 30, Sara Zelenak, 21, Sebastien Belanger, 36, James McMullan, 32, Kirsty Boden, 28, Alexandre Pigeard, 26, and Ignacio Echeverria, 39, were killed by the attackers. London Bridge attack: What happened Victims of the London Bridge attack Det Supt Riggs said 124 crime scenes were processed, almost 6,100 exhibits seized and 22 addresses searched in the subsequent investigation. The court heard 22 people were arrested but released without charge. When Jonathan Hough QC, counsel to the inquests, asked Det Supt Riggs if there was anything to suggest the attack had been directed from overseas, or by a wider network, she said: ""No, there was no evidence of that."" She admitted the phones used by the three knifemen in the build-up to the attack were never recovered. Mr Hough said the weapon taken from Butt had DNA on it thought to relate to Mr Pigeard and DNA traces thought to relate to Ms Zelenak and Mr Belanger - as well as traces thought to be Zaghba's.

MP Chuka Umunna joins Lib Dems,"This video can not be played Chuka Umunna tells Today there's only room for one centre ground party in British politics Former Labour and Change UK MP Chuka Umunna has joined the Liberal Democrats, saying he was ""wrong"" to think ""millions of politically homeless people... wanted a new party"". The Streatham MP said he had ""massively underestimated just how difficult it is to set up a fully fledged new party without an existing infrastructure"". He was one of six MPS to quit Change UK - founded in February - last week. It gained only 3.4% of the vote in the European elections. In contrast, the Liberal Democrats - who, like Change UK, campaigned on a strongly pro-EU message - saw a surge in support, coming second after Nigel Farage's Brexit Party. Iain Watson: The Changing Man of political parties Mr Umunna's move to the the Liberal Democrats brings the party's number of MPs to 12. Asked if he would hold a by-election and re-stand as a Lib Dem, Mr Umunna declined to answer directly but said that he had listened to his constituents and their biggest issue was Brexit.

The former shadow business secretary, who had previously criticised the Lib Dems for ""enabling Tory austerity"" during the 2010 to 2015 coalition government, acknowledged that not everyone in the party would welcome his arrival. However, he told the BBC ""things have changed"", as the Lib Dems had voted against every single Conservative Budget since 2015 and had stood on an anti-austerity manifesto in the 2017 general election. ""If you want to end austerity you cannot do that if you are going to sponsor Brexit in the way that the two main parties are doing,"" he added. Mr Umunna said he had realised ""there isn't room for more than one centre-ground option"" in British politics, adding that he believed there were ""a good handful"" of Conservative and Labour MPs who knew their parties were ""broken"" and could also be prepared to join the Lib Dems. Change UK applies to change name Umunna's Change exit a 'serious mistake' Davey and Swinson in Lib Dem run-off The MP, who withdrew from the 2015 Labour leadership contest days after announcing his candidacy, told the Times he did not want to take sides between the two contenders to replace Sir Vince Cable as Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson and Ed Davey, adding: ""I'm a newbie."" Welcoming him, Sir Vince said: ""Chuka and I have worked together effectively for many months, campaigning for a People's Vote and to stop Brexit. ""I know that he will be a great asset to our party not just on Brexit, but in fighting for the liberal and social democratic values that we share."" When asked if he expected other MPs to defect to his party, the Lib Dem leader confirmed he was ""in conversations"" with other independent MPs. Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said he was ""delighted"" to have Chuka Umunna in his party Mr Umunna's move was also welcomed by the two candidates for the Lib Dem leadership. Jo Swinson said the Lib Dems were ""the rallying point for people who want to stop Brexit and fight the climate crisis"", while Ed Davey praised the Streatham MP's ""huge courage"". Change UK - formerly known as The Independent Group - was formed by MPs who quit Labour and then joined by some former Conservatives. It pledged to push for any Brexit deal negotiated by the government to be voted on at a referendum - or ""People's Vote"" - in which it would campaign for the UK to remain in the EU. After last month's European Parliament elections, six of its 11 MPs quit. On Thursday it applied to change its name to The Independent Group for Change, to avoid a protracted legal dispute with petitions website Change.org. Labour Party chairman Ian Lavery called for a by-election in Mr Umunna's constituency,tweeting:,external""Three parties in as many months... who's next? Put your immense popularity to the good people of Streatham... let's have a PV [People's Vote] on you and your principles.""

Couple's baby joy after 13 miscarriages,"Ivy Worsley is now a healthy nine-month old girl A woman who suffered 13 miscarriages gave birth to a girl after pioneering work by a fertility expert. Eleven of Laura Worsley's pregnancies ended in the first trimester but she also lost two boys at 17 and 20 weeks. Professor Siobhan Quenby discovered she had two conditions affecting her ability to have children. Mrs Worsley and her husband Dave, from Kenilworth, got pregnant a 14th time and, with the help of Prof Quenby and her team, had a daughter named Ivy. ""Even now, nine months on, I can't believe she's actually mine,"" said Laura, 35. It was in 2008 the couple suffered the heartbreak of their first miscarriage. They said when it happened a third time, they knew something was wrong. Doctors advised them to keep trying but, after their fourth pregnancy ended, they were referred to Prof Quenby at University Hospital of Coventry and Warwickshire's Biomedical Research Unit. The birth of Ivy is a story that is being shared in medical circles all over the world It was discovered Laura had Antiphospholipid syndrome, also known as ""sticky blood syndrome"", which can cause recurring pregnancy loss. ""We were told a high dose of folic acid might sort it, but it didn't,"" said Laura, whose continued pregnancies never progressed beyond a few weeks. ""We took part in trials, did all the tests and tried different medications, hoping something would work."" Two pregnancies did get beyond the 12-week stage but the couple lost their boys, Graceson and Leo, in 2015 and 2017. ""I don't know how I coped, to be honest,"" said Laura. ""Dave stayed strong for me but when we lost the boys, he really struggled with that. ""It was all I lived for - I lost years of my life. I just thought, if I can't have a baby I don't see a point in my life,"" she said. Leo's placenta was tested and results showed Laura also had Chronic Histiocytic Intervillositis (CHI), which causes the body to fight pregnancy. ""It was causing my placenta to die in places,"" said Laura. ""I wasn't sure I wanted to try again. But Professor Quenby said she had helped women with this successfully. ""I thought if there's that one bit of hope, I had to try again. I spoke to Dave about it and he felt the same. ""I told myself, this is the last time I'm doing this."" After medication to improve the lining of Laura's womb, the couple conceived naturally for the 14th time. Laura and Dave kept the pregnancy a secret for fear of experiencing another loss Prof Quenby said they used steroids to suppress Laura's immune system to allow the pregnancy to progress beyond 24 weeks, when babies have a chance of surviving. Drugs helped stop her blood clotting. ""The steroids do have side effects,"" said Prof Quenby. ""But we both decided it was worth one more go."" After so many tragedies, Laura and Dave said they did not dare to dream this pregnancy would work. ""We didn't really tell anyone. It was the hardest thing to keep in but the hardest thing to share. I just kept thinking if we tell people, we're going to jinx it,"" said Laura. And then, at 30 weeks, Laura was in bed at home when her waters broke. Ivy was delivered by caesarean section while Laura was under a general anaesthetic. She weighed just 1.7 lbs, about the same as a Christmas pudding. Ivy was a fighter right from the start, Laura said ""My husband saw her first. He showed me a photo of her when I woke up,"" said Laura, whose daughter had been taken straight to a neonatal incubator in intensive care. It was three days before they could hold her. The new parents were warned Ivy might develop sepsis but she continued to thrive. ""I just thought, she's a fighter. She just kept going forward all the time, she never went back,"" said Laura. For Prof Quenby, it was two months before she dared to visit Ivy on the ward. ""I was delighted she was here but I just couldn't bear to see her until I knew she was ok. I'd ask the nurses to go and see her for me but I was too scared."" Ivy was so small, her father's ring fitted on her wrist After 11 weeks in hospital, which included recovering from bronchiolitis, Ivy was able to go home. She is now nine months old, and Laura's case is being highlighted globally as an example of how women with her conditions could still have successful pregnancies. ""I look at her and think 'miracles do happen', said Laura. ""I'd read about other people's miracles, and now I've got mine."" ""Laura's case is benefitting people across the world,"" said Prof Quenby. ""Many in her situation would have given up, but she just kept going."" Prof Quenby eventually plucked up the courage to meet Ivy in hospital Laura and Dave held a baby shower for Ivy - after she was born - and raised more than Â£1,000, which they have donated to the hospital's charity. ""It's so important to be able to make a difference for anyone else going through what I went through,"" said Laura, who is continuing to raise money through a JustGiving page. ""Through my story I want to give others the hope and strength to carry on even when things seem impossible.""

Adoptive families' new support 'crucial',"Mike and Tony adopted a boy who spent two years in care When Tony and Mike adopted a young boy, they were unsure what to do when he started screaming at night. But after help from a psychologist and a mentor they were able to cope. Now, families across Wales will have access to similar support after ministers gave Â£2.3m to strengthen adoption support services. Suzanne Griffiths of the National Adoption Service said the money would boost support available to adoptive families. Tony and Mike, who live in Cardiff, adopted their son six months ago after he spent two years in care. ""They [the adoption agency] put in place support, anything that comes up that we're not sure of, we can go to a psychologist,"" said Tony. ""He started having night terrors, screaming and crying, we were not sure what to do, so it's nice to have that reassurance that we're doing the best we can and give us advice. 'We felt abandoned as adoptive parents' More adoption help for families 'vital' Call to help end children's adoption wait ""He's gone through more than anyone in a lifetime and he's still asking 'am I going to leave you', that's a big burden for a young child, so it's nice to have the support. ""When he has tantrums, we think 'are they typical tantrums, or is this something else?' He's got a lot of baggage hidden away. ""We know now if something crops up, we've got support. I wouldn't change it for the world."" This video can not be played One adoptive couple said they were left ""at the end of our tether"" and blamed lack of help from the start. Support Tony and Mike had access to has not been available to everyone - but the investment will help to make it ""available consistently"", Ms Griffiths said. The National Adoption Service in Wales dealt with 167 new requests for post-adoption support in 2017-18 - up by about a third on the year before. Deputy Minister for Health and Social Services, Julie Morgan, announced the funding at an event where she also officially launched the new Adoption Register Wales, which aims to match families and children and speed up the adoption process. Part of the investment has also been used to match-fund Â£250,000 from the National Lottery Community Fund, granted to Adoption UK Cymru, for itsTherapeutic Education Support Services in Adoption,external(TESSA) programme. Ann Bell, development manager of AUK Cymru, said: ""TESSA gives an adoptive family access to a clinical psychologist and an experienced adopter, giving them coping strategies and an insight into how other parents have worked through challenges to help their family flourish. ""Early intervention is crucial to successful adoptions. The additional funding from Welsh Government will significantly increase the scale and reach of TESSA in Wales, making it more widely-available to new adoptive families."" Mrs Morgan said the Welsh Government funding would provide support to adopters and children being adopted. ""As well as ensuring that adoptive families can be found more quickly, this funding will enable the adoption regions to improve further the provision of adoption support services in their area,"" she added.

University faces 'financial uncertainties',"Developments have included a new home for the Faculty of Architecture, Computing and Engineering (Face) on Swansea waterfront University of Wales Trinity Saint David is facing financial uncertainty that could cast ""significant doubt"" over future operations. Its latest accounts said it might not have enough cash to continue as a going concern if some key sources of income did not materialise. UWTSD said the risk was remote and it had acted to secure its ""resilience"". It confirmed it was looking at 110 possible job cuts and had nearly completed a process to save Â£6.5m. The university has received 94 applications for voluntary redundancy and made 16 compulsory redundancies, but said it was working with staff and unions to reduce the need for the latter. UWTSD is based across three locations in west Wales - Lampeter, Carmarthen and Swansea - and employs 1,500 people. It had more than 10,000 students in 2017-18. Academic brands Wales' university mergers 'disgraceful' Swansea waterfront campus plan for university A new library is part of the waterfront developments Its latest accounts showed a Â£30m HSBC bank loan, forits development on Swansea's waterfront, had to be rearranged because it breached one of the conditions. They warned there was uncertainty over four expected sources of income - if a combination of them do not materialise, it could give rise to a ""material uncertainty"" over whether the university will have enough cash. The accounts - for the year to July 2018 - were not finalised until April 2019, said these were: A large grant towards the cost of a property development was expected in 2018 but had been delayed A sale of a property, subject to planning permission, had also been delayed Final savings from a restructuring process were not yet known Uncertainties, experienced by all universities, about student enrolment and retention No other Welsh universities have included a similar statement in the audit report in their accounts in recent years, according to higher education finance officials. A UWTSD spokeswoman said there was no ""significant doubt"" and the university was ""responding to a risk"". She said: ""The current uncertainty the university is facing is linked to the timing of it receiving grants. This is a holding issue that the university is dealing with. ""In line with good governance the university has identified the risk, as it is required to do in its financial accounts, and is managing it. The university's future is not uncertain."" Prof Medwin Hughes is vice-chancellor of the University of Wales Trinity Saint David The university is behind theYr Egin complex,externalin Carmarthen, the first phase of which houses S4C's headquarters.

Firefighter gets Â£1.5m after losing handIan McDonald was taking part in a training exercise when his hand was pierced by hydraulic fluid.Scotland,"This video can not be played 'One tiny wound cost me my whole hand' A firefighter whose hand was amputated after he was injured by faulty cutting gear has received Â£1.5m in damages. Ian McDonald, 37, was taking part in a training exercise in March 2014 when his hand was pierced by a high-pressure jet of hydraulic fluid. He had 40 operations after the toxic liquid destroyed the tissue in his right hand but after a four-year battle doctors were forced to amputate. The fire service said it had taken steps to prevent similar incidents. Ian with his daughter Ava before the accident Mr McDonald was injured during an exercise at Bishopbriggs fire station, in East Dunbartonshire, which was simulating rescuing a casualty from a car accident using hydraulic cutting equipment. It was only later that day he noticed his hand starting to swell and he began to feel a burning sensation. There was a small puncture wound through the side of his hand. The fluid got into Ian's hand through a small puncture wound ""One of my colleagues looked at the glove I had been wearing at the time and there was a hole straight through it,"" Mr McDonald, who is from Bishopbriggs, said. ""This started alarm bells ringing that this was a serious consideration."" He was taken to hospital and an X-ray showed oil inside his hand. It later emerged the hose pipe connecting the generator to the cutting gear, which pumps an internal fluid up to 850 Bars of pressure, was riddled with tiny punctures which can appear over time after being dragged over broken glass or metal shards at the scene of an incident. Ian McDonald said the past five years had been very difficult emotionally and physically One of these punctures caused a fine jet of hydraulic fluid to escape and pierce Mr McDonald's leather safety gloves. Over the next four years, he was in chronic pain and suffering repeated infections as doctors battled to keep his hand working. ""The doctors were doing everything they could to save my hand but at one point I lost one of my fingers, then another finger. ""They were using grafts from my leg to save what they had but it became apparent during last year that it was just beyond repair."" His hand was finally amputated in June 2018. ""It was a big thing but I didn't really see there was any other route to go down,"" he said. ""I'd already lost my hand by that point in a sense. ""When it was actually physically removed it was no great loss compared to what I'd already been going through."" Ian with his four children and his wife Claire In January, the father-of-four was fitted with a prosthetic hand which he says has given him a lot more independence. ""It allows me to do things for myself and not ask for help and gives me a bit more confidence,"" he said. He now has the dexterity to tie his own shoelaces and can help in the kitchen to a ""limited"" degree. Looking back on the past five years, Mr McDonald said it had been ""very difficult"" emotionally and physically but he thanked his wife Claire for helping him get through. ""At times it was frustrating, knowing it was going on for so long and not making any progress,"" he said. ""Physically, it has really taken its toll. I think I had 40 operations in total, each one under general anaesthetic. I also had skin grafts taken from other parts of my body, from my leg three times, and transplanted on to my hand and my arm. ""The medication I was on was really energy-sapping. It's been a tough time."" He said the amputation had been ""an overnight cure"" for his pain and suffering. ""The pain has gone away and the function is improving with the prosthetic device and it is just allowing me to get back to normal as much as I can,"" he said. Ian says his prosthetic hand has helped his independence and confidence An investigation into the incident by Digby Brown Solicitors revealed there was an inadequate system of inspection and maintenance for equipment despite the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service knowing about the risks. There were also protective coverings for the hose which would have prevented Ian's injury but they were not used. Solicitor David Nellaney said: ""The SFRS is undoubtedly a safety-conscious organisation that provides an invaluable service but on this occasion it failed in its duty of care to an employee. ""No settlement can alter the past, but it can improve the future and in Ian's case, it will provide access to ongoing medical treatment and ease the financial implications of this workplace injury."" Scottish Fire and Rescue's David McGown said he was heartened to see Mr McDonald make a strong recovery. He said: ""Following a robust investigation into Mr McDonald's injury, we undertook a review of equipment and related safety checks and have taken appropriate steps to minimise the risk of similar incidents happening in the future.""

'I'm living in a building that's unsafe',"Seventy two people died in the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017 More than 200 high-rise buildings in England with cladding similar to that used on Grenfell Tower are yet to have work to remove it. Out of 328 buildings that still have aluminium composite material (ACM) cladding, 221 are awaiting work to start. Events on Friday will mark the second anniversary of the Grenfell Tower fire in which 72 people died. The government will pay Â£200m to remove ACM from privately owned blocks. There have been calls for the funding to be extended to other forms of cladding and fire safety measures. The government ordered a review into cladding on high-rise blocks following the tragedy, when a blaze broke out in the 24-storey block of flats in North Kensington, west London. It took minutes for the fire to race up the exterior of the building, and spread to all four sides. A public inquiry into the disaster heard evidence to support the theory that the highly combustible material in the cladding was the primary cause of the fire's spread. As of the end of May, 105 other high-rise buildings that had previously failed safety tests have had work to remove the cladding completed. The data only covers ACM cladding and does not include buildings with other fire safety issues. Ahead of the second anniversary of the fire, campaigners projected messages on to tower blocks in Salford, Newcastle and Londonwhich they said were unsafe. The message on this Salford block says it has dangerous cladding The projection on to the NV building in Salford, which has 246 flats, said it was ""still covered in dangerous cladding"" that was not covered by the government's cladding removal fund. This video can not be played The friendships brought together through Grenfell Memorial services and vigils will be held throughout Friday to mark the second anniversary of the fire. Survivors and families will be joined by communities secretary James Brokenshire and fire minister Nick Hurd for a remembrance service in St Helen's Church, close to Grenfell Tower. Britain's Got Talent semi-finalist and Grenfell survivor Leanne Mya will sing during the service and white doves will be released afterwards. Other multi-faith services will also take place around the area, along with a private wreath-laying, a remembrance event in which 72 bells will be rung - one for each victim - and a silent walk organised by survivors' group Grenfell United. Karim Mussilhy, whose uncle died in the fire, said: ""Our plan is to come together with the rest of the community and be with each other, share some tears with each other, smiles with each other, and put our arms around each other and remember our loved ones and pay our respects. ""We also want to be a presence to everyone else, show them that we are still here and we are still standing strong together, dignified, respectful, we aren't going to go away, we're not going to fade away and we're not going to let others forget our loved ones and for us to be swept under the carpet."" There are high-rise buildings with ACM cladding in 62 local authority areas across England. Greenwich, Tower Hamlets and Salford were all found to have at least 20 buildings each with the cladding. Brent, Newham, Wandsworth, Westminster and Manchester have between 11 and 20 each, while Camden, Haringey, Islington, Lambeth, Leeds and Liverpool have between six and 10 each. Grenfell Tower: What happened? Who were the Grenfell fire victims? Next PM 'must prioritise Grenfell Tower' Ministers have promiseda Â£200m fundto help remove the material from private residential tower blocks. However, leaseholders said the fund did not go far enough and they would still be left facing bills of thousands of pounds for other fire safety measures. Alex Di Giuseppe is living in a building with ACM cladding Alex Di Giuseppe, who lives at City Gate, a block with ACM cladding in Manchester, said leaseholders were being expected to pay between Â£4,000 and Â£7,000, depending on the size of the flat. They were now waiting to find out how much the government funding might reduce the bill by. ""The government fund covers the ACM cladding, which helps, but doesn't cover any other type of cladding or fire safety work,"" said the 29-year-old, who works in marketing. ""There's a lot of stress involved living in a building that's technically unsafe. ""There are costs we can't afford and we can't sell our flats. We are mortgage prisoners.""

Gender stereotypes in adverts banned,"A ban on adverts featuring ""harmful gender stereotypes"" or those which are likely to cause ""serious or widespread offence"" has come into force. The ban covers scenarios such as a man with his feet up while a woman cleans, or a woman failing to park a car. The UK's advertising watchdog introduced the ban because it found some portrayals could play a part in ""limiting people's potential"". It said it was pleased with how advertisers had responded. The new rule follows areview of gender stereotyping in adverts,externalby the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) - the organisation that administers the UK Advertising Codes, which cover both broadcast and non-broadcast adverts, including online and social media. Watchdog bans gender stereotypes in adverts C4 offers Â£1m for 'positive' gender ads Co-op in Easter egg advert sexism row The ASA said the review had found evidence suggesting that harmful stereotypes could ""restrict the choices, aspirations and opportunities of children, young people and adults and these stereotypes can be reinforced by some advertising, which plays a part in unequal gender outcomes"". ""Our evidence shows how harmful gender stereotypes in ads can contribute to inequality in society, with costs for all of us. Put simply, we found that some portrayals in ads can, over time, play a part in limiting people's potential,"" said ASA chief executive Guy Parker. An advert for baby formula Aptamil was accused of reinforcing gender stereotypes Blogger and father of two Jim Coulson thinks the ban is a good idea. He dislikes adverts that perpetuate stereotypes about dads being ""useless"". ""It's the small things though that build up, and the small things are what inform the subconscious,"" he told the BBC. ""That's the problem... that adverts rely on stereotypes. We know why they do it, because it's easy. "" But columnist Angela Epstein disagrees, and thinks that society has become ""over-sensitive"". ""There's a lot of big things we need to fight over - equality over pay, bullying in the workplace, domestic violence, sexual harassment - these are really big issues that we need to fight over equally,"" she told the BBC. ""But when you chuck in the fact that women are doing the dishes [in advertisements], it's not in the same sphere. When we lump it all together and become desensitised, we devalue those important arguments we need to have."" As part of its review, the ASA brought together members of the public and showed them various adverts to gauge how they felt about how men and women were depicted. One of them was a 2017 television advert for Aptamil baby milk formula, which showed a baby girl growing up to be a ballerina and baby boys engineers and mountain climbers. The ASA found some parents ""felt strongly about the gender based aspirations shown in this advert specifically noting the stereotypical future professions of the boys and girls shown. ""These parents queried why these stereotypes were needed, feeling that they lacked diversity of gender roles and did not represent real life."" At the time it was released, the campaign prompted complaints but the ASA did not find grounds for a formal investigation as it did not break the rules. However, Fernando Desouches, managing director of marketing agency New Macho, which specialises in targeting men, said this was an example of a past advert that would not pass the new ASA legislation. He said it showed how easy it can be for ""deeply entrenched views on gender to come through in an ad that purports to be caring and nurturing of future generations."" He was ""unsurprised it generated a backlash"". Other situations likely to fall foul of the new rule include: Adverts which show a man or a woman failing at a task because of their gender, like a man failing to change a nappy or a woman failing to park Adverts aimed at new mothers which suggest that looking good or keeping a home tidy is more important than emotional wellbeing Adverts which belittle a man for carrying out stereotypically female roles However, the new rules do not preclude the use of all gender stereotypes. The ASA said the aim was to identify ""specific harms"" that should be prevented. So, for example, adverts would still be able to show women doing the shopping or men doing DIY, or use gender stereotypes as a way of challenging their negative effects. The ASAoutlined the new rulesat the end of last year, giving advertisers six months to prepare for their introduction. Mr Parker said the watchdog was pleased with how the industry had already responded. The ASA said it would deal with any complaints on a case-by-case basis and would assess each advert by looking at the ""content and context"" to determine if the new rule had been broken.

Firefighter gets Â£1.5m after losing hand,"This video can not be played 'One tiny wound cost me my whole hand' A firefighter whose hand was amputated after he was injured by faulty cutting gear has received Â£1.5m in damages. Ian McDonald, 37, was taking part in a training exercise in March 2014 when his hand was pierced by a high-pressure jet of hydraulic fluid. He had 40 operations after the toxic liquid destroyed the tissue in his right hand but after a four-year battle doctors were forced to amputate. The fire service said it had taken steps to prevent similar incidents. Ian with his daughter Ava before the accident Mr McDonald was injured during an exercise at Bishopbriggs fire station, in East Dunbartonshire, which was simulating rescuing a casualty from a car accident using hydraulic cutting equipment. It was only later that day he noticed his hand starting to swell and he began to feel a burning sensation. There was a small puncture wound through the side of his hand. The fluid got into Ian's hand through a small puncture wound ""One of my colleagues looked at the glove I had been wearing at the time and there was a hole straight through it,"" Mr McDonald, who is from Bishopbriggs, said. ""This started alarm bells ringing that this was a serious consideration."" He was taken to hospital and an X-ray showed oil inside his hand. It later emerged the hose pipe connecting the generator to the cutting gear, which pumps an internal fluid up to 850 Bars of pressure, was riddled with tiny punctures which can appear over time after being dragged over broken glass or metal shards at the scene of an incident. Ian McDonald said the past five years had been very difficult emotionally and physically One of these punctures caused a fine jet of hydraulic fluid to escape and pierce Mr McDonald's leather safety gloves. Over the next four years, he was in chronic pain and suffering repeated infections as doctors battled to keep his hand working. ""The doctors were doing everything they could to save my hand but at one point I lost one of my fingers, then another finger. ""They were using grafts from my leg to save what they had but it became apparent during last year that it was just beyond repair."" His hand was finally amputated in June 2018. ""It was a big thing but I didn't really see there was any other route to go down,"" he said. ""I'd already lost my hand by that point in a sense. ""When it was actually physically removed it was no great loss compared to what I'd already been going through."" Ian with his four children and his wife Claire In January, the father-of-four was fitted with a prosthetic hand which he says has given him a lot more independence. ""It allows me to do things for myself and not ask for help and gives me a bit more confidence,"" he said. He now has the dexterity to tie his own shoelaces and can help in the kitchen to a ""limited"" degree. Looking back on the past five years, Mr McDonald said it had been ""very difficult"" emotionally and physically but he thanked his wife Claire for helping him get through. ""At times it was frustrating, knowing it was going on for so long and not making any progress,"" he said. ""Physically, it has really taken its toll. I think I had 40 operations in total, each one under general anaesthetic. I also had skin grafts taken from other parts of my body, from my leg three times, and transplanted on to my hand and my arm. ""The medication I was on was really energy-sapping. It's been a tough time."" He said the amputation had been ""an overnight cure"" for his pain and suffering. ""The pain has gone away and the function is improving with the prosthetic device and it is just allowing me to get back to normal as much as I can,"" he said. Ian says his prosthetic hand has helped his independence and confidence An investigation into the incident by Digby Brown Solicitors revealed there was an inadequate system of inspection and maintenance for equipment despite the Scottish Fire and Rescue Service knowing about the risks. There were also protective coverings for the hose which would have prevented Ian's injury but they were not used. Solicitor David Nellaney said: ""The SFRS is undoubtedly a safety-conscious organisation that provides an invaluable service but on this occasion it failed in its duty of care to an employee. ""No settlement can alter the past, but it can improve the future and in Ian's case, it will provide access to ongoing medical treatment and ease the financial implications of this workplace injury."" Scottish Fire and Rescue's David McGown said he was heartened to see Mr McDonald make a strong recovery. He said: ""Following a robust investigation into Mr McDonald's injury, we undertook a review of equipment and related safety checks and have taken appropriate steps to minimise the risk of similar incidents happening in the future.""

Couple's baby joy after 13 miscarriagesLaura and Dave Worsley refused to give up hope - and their fertility expert was just as determined.Coventry & Warwickshire,"Ivy Worsley is now a healthy nine-month old girl A woman who suffered 13 miscarriages gave birth to a girl after pioneering work by a fertility expert. Eleven of Laura Worsley's pregnancies ended in the first trimester but she also lost two boys at 17 and 20 weeks. Professor Siobhan Quenby discovered she had two conditions affecting her ability to have children. Mrs Worsley and her husband Dave, from Kenilworth, got pregnant a 14th time and, with the help of Prof Quenby and her team, had a daughter named Ivy. ""Even now, nine months on, I can't believe she's actually mine,"" said Laura, 35. It was in 2008 the couple suffered the heartbreak of their first miscarriage. They said when it happened a third time, they knew something was wrong. Doctors advised them to keep trying but, after their fourth pregnancy ended, they were referred to Prof Quenby at University Hospital of Coventry and Warwickshire's Biomedical Research Unit. The birth of Ivy is a story that is being shared in medical circles all over the world It was discovered Laura had Antiphospholipid syndrome, also known as ""sticky blood syndrome"", which can cause recurring pregnancy loss. ""We were told a high dose of folic acid might sort it, but it didn't,"" said Laura, whose continued pregnancies never progressed beyond a few weeks. ""We took part in trials, did all the tests and tried different medications, hoping something would work."" Two pregnancies did get beyond the 12-week stage but the couple lost their boys, Graceson and Leo, in 2015 and 2017. ""I don't know how I coped, to be honest,"" said Laura. ""Dave stayed strong for me but when we lost the boys, he really struggled with that. ""It was all I lived for - I lost years of my life. I just thought, if I can't have a baby I don't see a point in my life,"" she said. Leo's placenta was tested and results showed Laura also had Chronic Histiocytic Intervillositis (CHI), which causes the body to fight pregnancy. ""It was causing my placenta to die in places,"" said Laura. ""I wasn't sure I wanted to try again. But Professor Quenby said she had helped women with this successfully. ""I thought if there's that one bit of hope, I had to try again. I spoke to Dave about it and he felt the same. ""I told myself, this is the last time I'm doing this."" After medication to improve the lining of Laura's womb, the couple conceived naturally for the 14th time. Laura and Dave kept the pregnancy a secret for fear of experiencing another loss Prof Quenby said they used steroids to suppress Laura's immune system to allow the pregnancy to progress beyond 24 weeks, when babies have a chance of surviving. Drugs helped stop her blood clotting. ""The steroids do have side effects,"" said Prof Quenby. ""But we both decided it was worth one more go."" After so many tragedies, Laura and Dave said they did not dare to dream this pregnancy would work. ""We didn't really tell anyone. It was the hardest thing to keep in but the hardest thing to share. I just kept thinking if we tell people, we're going to jinx it,"" said Laura. And then, at 30 weeks, Laura was in bed at home when her waters broke. Ivy was delivered by caesarean section while Laura was under a general anaesthetic. She weighed just 1.7 lbs, about the same as a Christmas pudding. Ivy was a fighter right from the start, Laura said ""My husband saw her first. He showed me a photo of her when I woke up,"" said Laura, whose daughter had been taken straight to a neonatal incubator in intensive care. It was three days before they could hold her. The new parents were warned Ivy might develop sepsis but she continued to thrive. ""I just thought, she's a fighter. She just kept going forward all the time, she never went back,"" said Laura. For Prof Quenby, it was two months before she dared to visit Ivy on the ward. ""I was delighted she was here but I just couldn't bear to see her until I knew she was ok. I'd ask the nurses to go and see her for me but I was too scared."" Ivy was so small, her father's ring fitted on her wrist After 11 weeks in hospital, which included recovering from bronchiolitis, Ivy was able to go home. She is now nine months old, and Laura's case is being highlighted globally as an example of how women with her conditions could still have successful pregnancies. ""I look at her and think 'miracles do happen', said Laura. ""I'd read about other people's miracles, and now I've got mine."" ""Laura's case is benefitting people across the world,"" said Prof Quenby. ""Many in her situation would have given up, but she just kept going."" Prof Quenby eventually plucked up the courage to meet Ivy in hospital Laura and Dave held a baby shower for Ivy - after she was born - and raised more than Â£1,000, which they have donated to the hospital's charity. ""It's so important to be able to make a difference for anyone else going through what I went through,"" said Laura, who is continuing to raise money through a JustGiving page. ""Through my story I want to give others the hope and strength to carry on even when things seem impossible.""

Residents 'trapped in dangerous properties',"Seventy two people died in the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017 More than 200 high-rise buildings in England with cladding similar to that used on Grenfell Tower are yet to have work to remove it. Out of 328 buildings that still have aluminium composite material (ACM) cladding, 221 are awaiting work to start. Events on Friday will mark the second anniversary of the Grenfell Tower fire in which 72 people died. The government will pay Â£200m to remove ACM from privately owned blocks. There have been calls for the funding to be extended to other forms of cladding and fire safety measures. The government ordered a review into cladding on high-rise blocks following the tragedy, when a blaze broke out in the 24-storey block of flats in North Kensington, west London. It took minutes for the fire to race up the exterior of the building, and spread to all four sides. A public inquiry into the disaster heard evidence to support the theory that the highly combustible material in the cladding was the primary cause of the fire's spread. As of the end of May, 105 other high-rise buildings that had previously failed safety tests have had work to remove the cladding completed. The data only covers ACM cladding and does not include buildings with other fire safety issues. Ahead of the second anniversary of the fire, campaigners projected messages on to tower blocks in Salford, Newcastle and Londonwhich they said were unsafe. The message on this Salford block says it has dangerous cladding The projection on to the NV building in Salford, which has 246 flats, said it was ""still covered in dangerous cladding"" that was not covered by the government's cladding removal fund. This video can not be played The friendships brought together through Grenfell Memorial services and vigils will be held throughout Friday to mark the second anniversary of the fire. Survivors and families will be joined by communities secretary James Brokenshire and fire minister Nick Hurd for a remembrance service in St Helen's Church, close to Grenfell Tower. Britain's Got Talent semi-finalist and Grenfell survivor Leanne Mya will sing during the service and white doves will be released afterwards. Other multi-faith services will also take place around the area, along with a private wreath-laying, a remembrance event in which 72 bells will be rung - one for each victim - and a silent walk organised by survivors' group Grenfell United. Karim Mussilhy, whose uncle died in the fire, said: ""Our plan is to come together with the rest of the community and be with each other, share some tears with each other, smiles with each other, and put our arms around each other and remember our loved ones and pay our respects. ""We also want to be a presence to everyone else, show them that we are still here and we are still standing strong together, dignified, respectful, we aren't going to go away, we're not going to fade away and we're not going to let others forget our loved ones and for us to be swept under the carpet."" There are high-rise buildings with ACM cladding in 62 local authority areas across England. Greenwich, Tower Hamlets and Salford were all found to have at least 20 buildings each with the cladding. Brent, Newham, Wandsworth, Westminster and Manchester have between 11 and 20 each, while Camden, Haringey, Islington, Lambeth, Leeds and Liverpool have between six and 10 each. Grenfell Tower: What happened? Who were the Grenfell fire victims? Next PM 'must prioritise Grenfell Tower' Ministers have promiseda Â£200m fundto help remove the material from private residential tower blocks. However, leaseholders said the fund did not go far enough and they would still be left facing bills of thousands of pounds for other fire safety measures. Alex Di Giuseppe is living in a building with ACM cladding Alex Di Giuseppe, who lives at City Gate, a block with ACM cladding in Manchester, said leaseholders were being expected to pay between Â£4,000 and Â£7,000, depending on the size of the flat. They were now waiting to find out how much the government funding might reduce the bill by. ""The government fund covers the ACM cladding, which helps, but doesn't cover any other type of cladding or fire safety work,"" said the 29-year-old, who works in marketing. ""There's a lot of stress involved living in a building that's technically unsafe. ""There are costs we can't afford and we can't sell our flats. We are mortgage prisoners."" Remembering Grenfell, two years on 'No guarantee' of Grenfell criminal charges Cladding tests 'almost certain to fail' A spokeswoman for the building's management agent Rendall and Rittner said mandatory internal work relating to fire safety was complete.

Swiss women stage national strike for equality,"This video can not be played Socialist MP Flavia Wasserfallen told Imogen Foulkes in June why women were taking to the streets Women across Switzerland have taken to the streets to protest against what they say is the country's unacceptably slow pace to equality. Friday's protest comes 28 years after similar action saw half a million women take to the streets in 1991. Swiss women have long campaigned to accelerate the pace of gender equality. They joined millions of other women in Europe after World War One ended in 1918 in demanding the right to vote - but did not get it until 1971. There were marches and rallies in the capital, Bern, and cities including Lausanne, Zurich, Neuchatel, Nyon and Basel At the time of the 1991 strike there were no women in the Swiss government, and there was no statutory maternity leave. Appenzell, the last Swiss canton to refuse women the right to vote, had just been ordered to change its policy by Switzerland's Supreme Court. Even in the 1920s women complained about the snail's pace with which Switzerland was tackling equal rights at work Some things have changed: there have since been eight female government ministers and the right to maternity leave is now enshrined in law. Is equal pay actually possible? Gender pay gap grows at hundreds of firms However, women in Switzerland still earn on average 20% less than men, they are under-represented in management positions, and childcare remains not only expensive, but in short supply. Last month, a survey by the International Labour Organisation put Switzerland bottom of the list in pay rates between men and women in senior roles. Journalist Beatrice Born, who was six months pregnant with her first child when she joined the strike back in 1991, will be striking again on Friday. When she returned to work following the birth of her daughter in 1991, she got something of a shock. No-one, it seemed, had expected her back, and certainly not full-time. ""The resistance was huge,"" she says. Paola Ferro, one of the organisers of the 1991 strike, will be back on the streets on Friday, too. She agrees that some progress has been made in the past 28 years, but points to the wage and pension gap. Swiss women's pensions are 37% lower than men's, primarily because women take time out from work to raise their children. A new strike was first suggested last year in response to parliament's decision to introduce more scrutiny on equal pay. The government's move only related to companies with more than 100 employees, a measure that women trade union leaders dismissed as virtually meaningless. Since then, women across the country have been mobilising, using social media to take advantage of the power of the hashtag. #Frauenstreik - women's strike in German - has been trending for days, along with #GrÃ¨vedesFemmes in French. Events were staged in many of the main cities on Friday, including Bern, Basel, Zurich, Sion, and Lausanne, where women filled the station concourse to sing a feminist hymn. Allow Twitter content?

In Geneva, street signs named after men were replaced with women's names. Social media has emerged in recent years as one of the most powerful techniques for quickly raising awareness of a particular issue and mobilising people for protests and demonstrations. This video can not be played Hashtags and online campaigns have given women around the world a voice Nadine, a Swiss law student not even born when the first strike took place in her country, will be among those taking part. ""I think it's a good thing,"" says the student, who comes from the traditionally conservative canton of Glarus. ""People will get informed about the many disadvantages women still face: we don't get equal pay, men still get prioritised with certain jobs,"" she adds. Aida, a 25-year-old yoga teacher, will be striking too. ""I think it's a good opportunity to stand together and show that we're not happy with the way things are,"" she explains. For her it's also a way to pay tribute to earlier struggles. ""I want to honour all the amazing, strong women who fought for us before."" Not every Swiss woman is entirely convinced. ""I'm not sure what to think about the strike,"" says one. ""Some of these feminists can be really in your face,"" another tells the BBC. But the fact that every Swiss town and village, from urban centre to alpine farming community, has an activity planned for the day, is an indication of widespread impatience with the slow pace of equality. Thousands of women have already informed their bosses they won't be at work. Others will leave at 15:30, reducing their working day by 20% to symbolise the 20% wage gap. But Switzerland has no tradition of major industrial stoppages, and there are unlikely to be unexpected walkouts.

"Swiss women stage national strike for equalityWomen are protesting against the slow pace of change, calling for ""more money, time and respect"".","This video can not be played Socialist MP Flavia Wasserfallen told Imogen Foulkes in June why women were taking to the streets Women across Switzerland have taken to the streets to protest against what they say is the country's unacceptably slow pace to equality. Friday's protest comes 28 years after similar action saw half a million women take to the streets in 1991. Swiss women have long campaigned to accelerate the pace of gender equality. They joined millions of other women in Europe after World War One ended in 1918 in demanding the right to vote - but did not get it until 1971. There were marches and rallies in the capital, Bern, and cities including Lausanne, Zurich, Neuchatel, Nyon and Basel At the time of the 1991 strike there were no women in the Swiss government, and there was no statutory maternity leave. Appenzell, the last Swiss canton to refuse women the right to vote, had just been ordered to change its policy by Switzerland's Supreme Court. Even in the 1920s women complained about the snail's pace with which Switzerland was tackling equal rights at work Some things have changed: there have since been eight female government ministers and the right to maternity leave is now enshrined in law. Is equal pay actually possible? Gender pay gap grows at hundreds of firms However, women in Switzerland still earn on average 20% less than men, they are under-represented in management positions, and childcare remains not only expensive, but in short supply. Last month, a survey by the International Labour Organisation put Switzerland bottom of the list in pay rates between men and women in senior roles. Journalist Beatrice Born, who was six months pregnant with her first child when she joined the strike back in 1991, will be striking again on Friday. When she returned to work following the birth of her daughter in 1991, she got something of a shock. No-one, it seemed, had expected her back, and certainly not full-time. ""The resistance was huge,"" she says. Paola Ferro, one of the organisers of the 1991 strike, will be back on the streets on Friday, too. She agrees that some progress has been made in the past 28 years, but points to the wage and pension gap. Swiss women's pensions are 37% lower than men's, primarily because women take time out from work to raise their children. A new strike was first suggested last year in response to parliament's decision to introduce more scrutiny on equal pay. The government's move only related to companies with more than 100 employees, a measure that women trade union leaders dismissed as virtually meaningless. Since then, women across the country have been mobilising, using social media to take advantage of the power of the hashtag. #Frauenstreik - women's strike in German - has been trending for days, along with #GrÃ¨vedesFemmes in French. Events were staged in many of the main cities on Friday, including Bern, Basel, Zurich, Sion, and Lausanne, where women filled the station concourse to sing a feminist hymn. Allow Twitter content?

In Geneva, street signs named after men were replaced with women's names. Social media has emerged in recent years as one of the most powerful techniques for quickly raising awareness of a particular issue and mobilising people for protests and demonstrations. This video can not be played Hashtags and online campaigns have given women around the world a voice Nadine, a Swiss law student not even born when the first strike took place in her country, will be among those taking part. ""I think it's a good thing,"" says the student, who comes from the traditionally conservative canton of Glarus. ""People will get informed about the many disadvantages women still face: we don't get equal pay, men still get prioritised with certain jobs,"" she adds. Aida, a 25-year-old yoga teacher, will be striking too. ""I think it's a good opportunity to stand together and show that we're not happy with the way things are,"" she explains. For her it's also a way to pay tribute to earlier struggles. ""I want to honour all the amazing, strong women who fought for us before."" Not every Swiss woman is entirely convinced. ""I'm not sure what to think about the strike,"" says one. ""Some of these feminists can be really in your face,"" another tells the BBC. But the fact that every Swiss town and village, from urban centre to alpine farming community, has an activity planned for the day, is an indication of widespread impatience with the slow pace of equality. Thousands of women have already informed their bosses they won't be at work. Others will leave at 15:30, reducing their working day by 20% to symbolise the 20% wage gap. But Switzerland has no tradition of major industrial stoppages, and there are unlikely to be unexpected walkouts. Some employers have said the strike is illegal, but many big companies seem to be taking a pragmatic approach. Retail giant Migros has said it would prefer employees not to simply down tools, but has also suggested there will be no disciplinary action if they do.

Hundreds of buildings still have 'unsafe' cladding,"Seventy two people died in the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017 More than 200 high-rise buildings in England with cladding similar to that used on Grenfell Tower are yet to have work to remove it. Out of 328 buildings that still have aluminium composite material (ACM) cladding, 221 are awaiting work to start. Events on Friday will mark the second anniversary of the Grenfell Tower fire in which 72 people died. The government will pay Â£200m to remove ACM from privately owned blocks. There have been calls for the funding to be extended to other forms of cladding and fire safety measures. The government ordered a review into cladding on high-rise blocks following the tragedy, when a blaze broke out in the 24-storey block of flats in North Kensington, west London. It took minutes for the fire to race up the exterior of the building, and spread to all four sides. A public inquiry into the disaster heard evidence to support the theory that the highly combustible material in the cladding was the primary cause of the fire's spread. As of the end of May, 105 other high-rise buildings that had previously failed safety tests have had work to remove the cladding completed. The data only covers ACM cladding and does not include buildings with other fire safety issues. Ahead of the second anniversary of the fire, campaigners projected messages on to tower blocks in Salford, Newcastle and Londonwhich they said were unsafe. The message on this Salford block says it has dangerous cladding The projection on to the NV building in Salford, which has 246 flats, said it was ""still covered in dangerous cladding"" that was not covered by the government's cladding removal fund. This video can not be played The friendships brought together through Grenfell Memorial services and vigils will be held throughout Friday to mark the second anniversary of the fire. Survivors and families will be joined by communities secretary James Brokenshire and fire minister Nick Hurd for a remembrance service in St Helen's Church, close to Grenfell Tower. Britain's Got Talent semi-finalist and Grenfell survivor Leanne Mya will sing during the service and white doves will be released afterwards. Other multi-faith services will also take place around the area, along with a private wreath-laying, a remembrance event in which 72 bells will be rung - one for each victim - and a silent walk organised by survivors' group Grenfell United. Karim Mussilhy, whose uncle died in the fire, said: ""Our plan is to come together with the rest of the community and be with each other, share some tears with each other, smiles with each other, and put our arms around each other and remember our loved ones and pay our respects. ""We also want to be a presence to everyone else, show them that we are still here and we are still standing strong together, dignified, respectful, we aren't going to go away, we're not going to fade away and we're not going to let others forget our loved ones and for us to be swept under the carpet."" There are high-rise buildings with ACM cladding in 62 local authority areas across England. Greenwich, Tower Hamlets and Salford were all found to have at least 20 buildings each with the cladding. Brent, Newham, Wandsworth, Westminster and Manchester have between 11 and 20 each, while Camden, Haringey, Islington, Lambeth, Leeds and Liverpool have between six and 10 each. Grenfell Tower: What happened? Who were the Grenfell fire victims? Next PM 'must prioritise Grenfell Tower' Ministers have promiseda Â£200m fundto help remove the material from private residential tower blocks. However, leaseholders said the fund did not go far enough and they would still be left facing bills of thousands of pounds for other fire safety measures. Alex Di Giuseppe is living in a building with ACM cladding Alex Di Giuseppe, who lives at City Gate, a block with ACM cladding in Manchester, said leaseholders were being expected to pay between Â£4,000 and Â£7,000, depending on the size of the flat. They were now waiting to find out how much the government funding might reduce the bill by. ""The government fund covers the ACM cladding, which helps, but doesn't cover any other type of cladding or fire safety work,"" said the 29-year-old, who works in marketing. ""There's a lot of stress involved living in a building that's technically unsafe. ""There are costs we can't afford and we can't sell our flats. We are mortgage prisoners."" Remembering Grenfell, two years on 'No guarantee' of Grenfell criminal charges Cladding tests 'almost certain to fail' A spokeswoman for the building's management agent Rendall and Rittner said mandatory internal work relating to fire safety was complete. She added the company was applying for government funding ""to reduce costs to leaseholders as far as is possible"". Manchester Central MP Lucy Powell told the House of Commons: ""Residents are trapped in dangerous properties. ""The fund does not cover many buildings in my constituency that have other cladding - not ACM cladding - or that have no firebreaks or other safety concerns."" Grenfell United wants a social housing regulator created to ensure tenants are listened to when they raise concerns and for dangerous materials including cladding to be banned and removed from homes. Natasha Elcock, who chairs the organisation and is a survivor from the tower, said: ""It's been two years since Grenfell and people are still going to bed at night worried that a fire like Grenfell could happen to them."" The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: ""The government has banned combustible materials in the external walls of new high-rise homes and guidance requires that sprinklers must be installed in new buildings above 30 metres. ""Building owners are ultimately responsible for the safety of the building and it is for them to decide whether to retro-fit sprinklers.""

Iran calls US oil tanker accusation 'unfounded',"This video can not be played Iranian TV footage shows a burning tanker Iran says it ""categorically rejects"" US claims that it is behind attacks on two oil tankers in the Gulf of Oman. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo had blamed Iran for the ""unprovoked attacks"" on Thursday. He added that the US had made its assessment based on intelligence about the type of weapons used. But Iran dismissed the claim as ""unfounded"". A senior Iranian official had earlier told the BBC that ""Iran has no connection"" with the explosions. Dozens of crew members were rescued after the blasts on the Japanese-owned Kokuka Courageous and the Front Altair, owned by a Norwegian company. In a statement released on Friday, the Iranian mission to the United Nations said: ""Iran categorically rejects the US unfounded claim with regard to 13 June oil tanker incidents, and condemns it in the strongest possible terms."" Within hours of the denial, the US military's Central Command released a video it says shows Iran's Revolutionary Guard ""removing [an] unexploded limpet mine"" from the side of the Kokuka Courageous following the blasts. Gulf of Oman tanker 'attacks': What we know Iran, the US and the Gulf: What now? US-Iran tensions explained The blasts come a month after four oil tankers were damaged in an unclaimed attack off the United Arab Emirates. The US at the time blamed Iran - but Tehran denied the accusations. Oil prices jumped as much as 4% after Thursday's incident in the Gulf of Oman, which lies at one end of a vital shipping lane through which hundreds of millions of dollars of oil pass. BIMCO, the world's largest international shipping association, said the tension in the area are ""now as high as it gets without being an actual armed conflict"". Meanwhile, UK Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt warned that if Iran was involved, ""it is a deeply unwise escalation which poses a real danger to the prospects of peace and stability in the region"". ""It is the assessment of the United States that the Islamic Republic of Iran is responsible for the attacks,"" the US secretary of state said at a news conference in Washington. This video can not be played Mike Pompeo: ""Unprovoked attacks a clear threat to peace and security"" ""This assessment is based on intelligence, the weapons used, the level of expertise needed to execute the operation, recent similar Iranian attacks on shipping, and the fact that no proxy group operating in the area has the resources and proficiency to act with such a high degree of sophistication."" Mr Pompeo presented no evidence. ""This is only the latest in the series of attacks instigated by the Islamic Republic of Iran and its surrogates against American and allied interests. ""Taken as a whole, these unprovoked attacks present a clear threat to international peace and security, a blatant assault on the freedom of navigation, and an unacceptable campaign of escalating tension by Iran,"" Mr Pompeo said. The Norwegian Maritime Authority said earlier on Thursday that the Front Altair had been ""attacked"", and that there were three blasts on board. Wu I-fang, a spokesman for Taiwan's CPC Corp oil refiner, which chartered the Front Altair, said it was carrying 75,000 tonnes of naphtha and was ""suspected of being hit by a torpedo"", although this has not been confirmed. Other unverified reports suggested a mine attack. The ship's owner, Frontline, said the vessel was on fire - but denied reports in Iranian media that it had sunk. The operator of the Kokuka Courageous, BSM Ship Management, said its crew abandoned ship and were rescued by a passing vessel. Both Iran and the US have released pictures showing rescued crew members on board their vessels. The 21 crew on the Kokuka Courageous (L) and 23 on the Front Altair have been rescued In 2018, the US pulled out of the landmark nuclear deal reached in 2015 that was aimed at curbing Iran's nuclear activities. The move was strongly criticised by a number of countries, including America's closest allies. In May, President Donald Trump tightened US sanctions on Iran - mainly targeting its oil sector. Iran then announced it was suspending some commitments under the nuclear deal. In recent months the US has strengthened its forces in the Gulf - saying there was a danger of Iranian attacks. This video can not be played Why does the Strait of Hormuz matter? It has sent an aircraft carrier strike group and B-52 bombers to the region. In response, Iran has accused the US of aggressive behaviour. Those tensions rose markedly after the 12 May limpet mine attacks in the UAE. This video can not be played The BBC was invited on board the USS Abraham Lincoln in the Arabian Sea The UAE blamed an unnamed ""state actor"". The US said that actor was Iran, an accusation Tehran has denied. It is a pretty damning verdict from Mr Pompeo but as yet little detail has been given as to the exact nature of the intelligence and the extent to which a forensic analysis of the damage to the two tankers is backed up by other information - satellite or other tracking of the movements of any other vessels involved and so on. Some may argue that there is a danger of a rush to judgement. And it is clear that if the US intends a response, especially a military one, then many countries - even friendly governments - will want to have chapter and verse on exactly what the US intelligence amounts to. Iran, for its part, was quick to deny any involvement in the incidents. Indeed it sought to deflect blame by arguing in effect that it was being framed. ""Somebody,"" an Iranian official asserted, ""is trying to destabilise relations between Iran and the international community."" UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres condemned Thursday's blasts. He told the Security Council that the world cannot afford ""a major confrontation in the Gulf region"". The UK's foreign secretary said it would conduct its own assessment, but the ""starting point is obviously to believe our US allies"". Meanwhile, the EU called for ""maximum restraint"", while Russia said no-one should jump to conclusions or use the incident to put pressure on Iran, a Russian ally. The incident is expected to be discussed at a closed-door meeting of the UN Security Council later on Thursday. Paolo d'Amico, chairman of the tanker association, Intertanko, said the two vessels had been attacked, and expressed concern about dangers to other crews. ""If the waters are becoming unsafe, the [oil] supply to the entire Western world could be at risk,"" he said. Were you on board one of the tankers? Do you know anybody who was on board?

Analysis: Is Johnson now vulnerable?,"The margin of success took his fellow candidates by surprise - but not the core of Boris Johnson's team. After many, many weeks of private campaigning, introducing Boris Johnson to the world of the spreadsheet, this morning one of his organisers wrote the number 114 and sealed it in an envelope. At lunchtime, the announcement revealed the controversial former foreign secretary had indeed received exactly that number. That is not just a marker of the level of Mr Johnson's support, but for the sometimes clownish politician, whose reputation has risen and fallen and then risen again, it's a sign that it is different this time. His campaign has extended way beyond his old friends. The discipline his lieutenants are trying to instil is holding at this stage. But his success today leaves him vulnerable. Frontrunner status is a precious commodity. It makes him the target for all of the others left in the race, for all of them to pitch themselves to those many MPs who feel strongly that he is wrong for the job. Johnson tops first Tory leadership poll The UK's next prime minister: What you need to know So members of his campaign team tell me their motto is simple - do not die. His place in the final two of the race to become our prime minister is secure, unless he errs explosively. With Boris Johnson, that is not a secure bet. And once in that final duet, weeks of scrutiny and challenge await. There is a choice for those who want to stop him now. Discussions are live tonight between the other camps in the race over what to do next. Should there be an effort to come together behind one candidate who could beat Mr Johnson? Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said tonight - arriving back at the Pall Mall mansion that used to be Mr Johnson's formal residence, of course - that he is the person to take him on. Although he had fewer votes than expected today, he's clearly not going to pull out. Sajid Javid and Matt Hancock though, the home and health secretaries, met this afternoon after the results. Sources close to Mr Hancock say he's ""mulling over"" what to do next. There's no final decision, but don't be hugely surprised if by Friday lunchtime he has withdrawn from the contest. One of the only things we can be sure of: The next prime minister will be a man Rory Stewart though is not going anywhere. He is instead ramping up his rhetoric against his fellow Old Etonian (yes, he and Boris Johnson did not just go to the same school, but also to the same Oxford college), and talking boldly about how only he can be the person to take him on. Given his place on the political spectrum frankly that seems extremely unlikely, however many views his videos get on Twitter. And while his team are extremely gung-ho, and he has built up some impressive momentum, some MPs from the so-called One Nation, (centre-ish) part of the Tory party are pretty cross, telling me that either Javid or Hancock had a decent crack if he would get out of the way. There is plenty more of this political intrigue to come in the next week or so, whether it bores you to tears or is the insider manoeuvring that excites you. It's fluid, and there is, as I tediously probably always say, a long way to go. There are two things we can be absolutely sure of, tonight Boris Johnson is looking hard to beat. And with Esther McVey and Andrea Leadsom both out of the race, the next prime minister will be a man.

MP Chuka Umunna joins the Lib DemsThe former Labour and Change UK MP says he was wrong to think people wanted a new party.UK Politics,"This video can not be played Chuka Umunna tells Today there's only room for one centre ground party in British politics Former Labour and Change UK MP Chuka Umunna has joined the Liberal Democrats, saying he was ""wrong"" to think ""millions of politically homeless people... wanted a new party"". The Streatham MP said he had ""massively underestimated just how difficult it is to set up a fully fledged new party without an existing infrastructure"". He was one of six MPS to quit Change UK - founded in February - last week. It gained only 3.4% of the vote in the European elections. In contrast, the Liberal Democrats - who, like Change UK, campaigned on a strongly pro-EU message - saw a surge in support, coming second after Nigel Farage's Brexit Party. Iain Watson: The Changing Man of political parties Mr Umunna's move to the the Liberal Democrats brings the party's number of MPs to 12. Asked if he would hold a by-election and re-stand as a Lib Dem, Mr Umunna declined to answer directly but said that he had listened to his constituents and their biggest issue was Brexit.

The former shadow business secretary, who had previously criticised the Lib Dems for ""enabling Tory austerity"" during the 2010 to 2015 coalition government, acknowledged that not everyone in the party would welcome his arrival. However, he told the BBC ""things have changed"", as the Lib Dems had voted against every single Conservative Budget since 2015 and had stood on an anti-austerity manifesto in the 2017 general election. ""If you want to end austerity you cannot do that if you are going to sponsor Brexit in the way that the two main parties are doing,"" he added. Mr Umunna said he had realised ""there isn't room for more than one centre-ground option"" in British politics, adding that he believed there were ""a good handful"" of Conservative and Labour MPs who knew their parties were ""broken"" and could also be prepared to join the Lib Dems. Change UK applies to change name Umunna's Change exit a 'serious mistake' Davey and Swinson in Lib Dem run-off The MP, who withdrew from the 2015 Labour leadership contest days after announcing his candidacy, told the Times he did not want to take sides between the two contenders to replace Sir Vince Cable as Lib Dem leader, Jo Swinson and Ed Davey, adding: ""I'm a newbie."" Welcoming him, Sir Vince said: ""Chuka and I have worked together effectively for many months, campaigning for a People's Vote and to stop Brexit.

Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said he was ""delighted"" to have Chuka Umunna in his party Mr Umunna's move was also welcomed by the two candidates for the Lib Dem leadership.

Chelsea agree deal for Sarri to join JuveChelsea agree a deal in principle for their Italian manager Maurizio Sarri to join Serie A club Juventus.,"Maurizio Sarri had never won a major trophy before May's Europa League win, having spent much of his career in Italy's lower leagues Chelsea have agreed a deal in principle for their manager Maurizio Sarri to join Serie A champions Juventus. An agreement was reached late on Thursday evening after talks between senior officials. A deal could be completed as early as Friday. It is understood a compensation fee in excess of Â£5m has been agreed. Sarri arrived from Napoli in July 2018 and led the Blues to third place in the Premier League andwon the Europa Leaguein his one season in charge. Why Sarri is leaving Stamford Bridge with stock higher than when he arrived Despite signing a three-year deal last July, he will become the ninth full-time manager to leave the club under Chelsea owner Roman Abramovich. Throughout the 60-year-old Italian's time at Stamford Bridge there was repeated speculation about his position, with Chelsea fansexpressing their discontent at tactics and team selections. One of the low points came in February when goalkeeper Kepa Arrizabalaga challenged his authority byrefusing to be substitutedin the Carabao Cup final at Wembley, shortly before Chelsea were beaten in a penalty shootout by Manchester City. But Sarri did manage to win his first ever trophy as manager with a 4-1 victory over Arsenal in May in the Europa League final, and after the match said ""he deserved"" to stay with the club. Chelsea are currently unable to sign any players after they werebanned for two transfer windowsby Fifa - a decision they are appealing at the Court of Arbitration for Sport. Their star player Eden Hazard hasjoined Real Madridfor a fee that could exceed Â£150m. Significantly, Chelsea have not asked for the suspension to be put on hold until a final decision is reached. It means their only new arrival might be USA forward Christian Pulisic, a Â£58m signing from Borussia Dortmund in January, who spent the remainder of the campaign on loan in Germany. Juventus are managerless after Massimiliano Allegri left at the end of last season, having won the league title in each of his five seasons since taking charge in 2014. After earning glowing references for his tactics at Napoli, he looked to have effectively introduced 'Sarri-ball' to his new players as Chelsea started their Premier League campaign with a 12-game unbeaten streak. But the Blues were out of title contention after losing three out of four Premier League games from January to February, including a 6-0 defeat at eventual champions Manchester City, which saw them slip to sixth in the table. Chelsea thenlost 2-0 at home to Manchester Unitedin the FA Cup, when fans booed the Italian's substitutions and joined in when the visiting supporters sang ""You're getting sacked in the morning"". However, Sarri remained in charge, and of the 19 matches played after they were beaten on penalties in the League Cup final, his side lost just two, as they won their first European trophy since securing the Europa League in 2012-13. They also held off the challenge of Tottenham, Arsenal and Manchester United to finish third in the league and clinch Champions League qualification. BBC Sport's Simon Stone For all the difficulties Chelsea managers tend to encounter, there has been no shortage of potential candidates being linked to the job. The most obvious is Blues' record scorer Frank Lampard. Lampard ended his first season as a manager with defeat at Wembley in the Championship play-off. Lampard is steeped in Chelsea history, won 11 major trophies during his 13 years at the club, and is adored by supporters, even though he eventually moved away to join Manchester City before ending his career in Major League Soccer with New York City. At Derby, Lampard also linked up with former team-mate Jody Morris, who developed an impressive reputation during five years working with Chelsea's youth teams - that might improve the pair's chances even more, given the transfer embargo Chelsea are facing. Chelsea loanees Fikayo Tomori, Mason Mount and Tammy Abraham were all involved at Wembley and others, such as Reece James, have also impressed in season-long moves away from the club. Morris' inside knowledge would be a major asset in deciding which of these youngsters have the capability to step into the first-team picture. It is also probable, although by no means certain, that Lampard would be given time if results did not go well. Rafael Benitez, whose Newcastle future is uncertain, is also tipped, despite the fact Chelsea's fans have no love of the 59-year-old, something they made clear during his six months in temporary charge following the dismissal of Roberto di Matteo in 2012, when fans made banners demanding his exit even though he won the Europa League. Wolves manager Nuno Espirito Santo is also of interest. Santo has taken Wolves from the Championship to seventh in the Premier League - and European qualification - in the space of two seasons. He is known to be hugely ambitious and for all the promise Wolves have shown during his time at Molineux, Chelsea still represents a significant step up. And, given Chelsea have already had six Italian managers and he has won five Serie A titles in a row, Massimiliano Allegri cannot be discounted, even if the 51-year-old has said he intends to take a year out of football.

"Hundreds of buildings still have 'unsafe' claddingTwo years on from the Grenfell Tower fire, 328 high-rises still have the same type of cladding.England","Seventy two people died in the Grenfell Tower fire in 2017 More than 200 high-rise buildings in England with cladding similar to that used on Grenfell Tower are yet to have work to remove it. Out of 328 buildings that still have aluminium composite material (ACM) cladding, 221 are awaiting work to start. Events on Friday will mark the second anniversary of the Grenfell Tower fire in which 72 people died. The government will pay Â£200m to remove ACM from privately owned blocks. There have been calls for the funding to be extended to other forms of cladding and fire safety measures. The government ordered a review into cladding on high-rise blocks following the tragedy, when a blaze broke out in the 24-storey block of flats in North Kensington, west London. It took minutes for the fire to race up the exterior of the building, and spread to all four sides. A public inquiry into the disaster heard evidence to support the theory that the highly combustible material in the cladding was the primary cause of the fire's spread. As of the end of May, 105 other high-rise buildings that had previously failed safety tests have had work to remove the cladding completed. The data only covers ACM cladding and does not include buildings with other fire safety issues. Ahead of the second anniversary of the fire, campaigners projected messages on to tower blocks in Salford, Newcastle and Londonwhich they said were unsafe. The message on this Salford block says it has dangerous cladding The projection on to the NV building in Salford, which has 246 flats, said it was ""still covered in dangerous cladding"" that was not covered by the government's cladding removal fund. This video can not be played The friendships brought together through Grenfell Memorial services and vigils will be held throughout Friday to mark the second anniversary of the fire. Survivors and families will be joined by communities secretary James Brokenshire and fire minister Nick Hurd for a remembrance service in St Helen's Church, close to Grenfell Tower. Britain's Got Talent semi-finalist and Grenfell survivor Leanne Mya will sing during the service and white doves will be released afterwards. Other multi-faith services will also take place around the area, along with a private wreath-laying, a remembrance event in which 72 bells will be rung - one for each victim - and a silent walk organised by survivors' group Grenfell United. Karim Mussilhy, whose uncle died in the fire, said: ""Our plan is to come together with the rest of the community and be with each other, share some tears with each other, smiles with each other, and put our arms around each other and remember our loved ones and pay our respects. ""We also want to be a presence to everyone else, show them that we are still here and we are still standing strong together, dignified, respectful, we aren't going to go away, we're not going to fade away and we're not going to let others forget our loved ones and for us to be swept under the carpet."" There are high-rise buildings with ACM cladding in 62 local authority areas across England. Greenwich, Tower Hamlets and Salford were all found to have at least 20 buildings each with the cladding. Brent, Newham, Wandsworth, Westminster and Manchester have between 11 and 20 each, while Camden, Haringey, Islington, Lambeth, Leeds and Liverpool have between six and 10 each. Grenfell Tower: What happened? Who were the Grenfell fire victims? Next PM 'must prioritise Grenfell Tower' Ministers have promiseda Â£200m fundto help remove the material from private residential tower blocks. However, leaseholders said the fund did not go far enough and they would still be left facing bills of thousands of pounds for other fire safety measures. Alex Di Giuseppe is living in a building with ACM cladding Alex Di Giuseppe, who lives at City Gate, a block with ACM cladding in Manchester, said leaseholders were being expected to pay between Â£4,000 and Â£7,000, depending on the size of the flat. They were now waiting to find out how much the government funding might reduce the bill by. ""The government fund covers the ACM cladding, which helps, but doesn't cover any other type of cladding or fire safety work,"" said the 29-year-old, who works in marketing. ""There's a lot of stress involved living in a building that's technically unsafe. ""There are costs we can't afford and we can't sell our flats. We are mortgage prisoners."" Remembering Grenfell, two years on 'No guarantee' of Grenfell criminal charges Cladding tests 'almost certain to fail' A spokeswoman for the building's management agent Rendall and Rittner said mandatory internal work relating to fire safety was complete. She added the company was applying for government funding ""to reduce costs to leaseholders as far as is possible"". Manchester Central MP Lucy Powell told the House of Commons: ""Residents are trapped in dangerous properties. ""The fund does not cover many buildings in my constituency that have other cladding - not ACM cladding - or that have no firebreaks or other safety concerns."" Grenfell United wants a social housing regulator created to ensure tenants are listened to when they raise concerns and for dangerous materials including cladding to be banned and removed from homes. Natasha Elcock, who chairs the organisation and is a survivor from the tower, said: ""It's been two years since Grenfell and people are still going to bed at night worried that a fire like Grenfell could happen to them."" The Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government said: ""The government has banned combustible materials in the external walls of new high-rise homes and guidance requires that sprinklers must be installed in new buildings above 30 metres. ""Building owners are ultimately responsible for the safety of the building and it is for them to decide whether to retro-fit sprinklers.""

Boarding a 'chatty bus' to fight loneliness,"This video can not be played Passengers chatting aboard a bus in Plymouth The BBC and public transport companies are encouraging people to try talking to their fellow passengers. It's part of Crossing Divides On the Move day, an initiative testing the theory that we benefit from talking to strangers. Former NHS nurse Kate Smith is a believer. ""When you look up and out, you see that there are some really nice people around,"" she says. ""And people actually care about who you are and what you've done today."" Kate co-founded Plymouth-based dementia charity Memory Matters. At the charity's city centre cafe she introduces us to Anne-Marie, Derek and Hazel. They've agreed to take part in our simple experiment: can a conversation on the bus make you feel happier and less lonely? The surprising benefits of talking to strangers About Crossing Divides On the Move Your stories of commuting conversations Joined by other volunteers, we climb on a double-decker in Plymouth and, at first, ask all our passengers to keep themselves to themselves. You can picture the scene: headphones in, eyes glued to phones and vacant gazes out of the window. Then we give our volunteers a simple task: talk to another passenger. The atmosphere immediately changes. ""It's the best bus I've been on"", laughs Anne-Marie. Anxiety means that she normally ""struggles talking to people"" and can feel very lonely in a crowded room. But on our chatty bus she doesn't feel isolated or alone. ""I just feel quite comfortable and there's a good energy around everyone,"" is the way 19-year-old Hazel puts it. And for Derek Perry, who describes loneliness as ""one of his worst illnesses"", the bus is a ""happy place"". ""We should look at different ideas of how we encourage people to talk to each other."" The enthusiasm is clear in his voice. Claire Haigh believes there is a ""loneliness epidemic"" in the UK. She heads the transport group Greener Journeys, a coalition including bus operators and passenger groups. Its polling data suggests that a third of people have caught a bus purely to have human contact. A bus driver, she says, can be the only person that someone communicates with throughout the course of an entire day. ""We need to find ways to create more cohesive communities,"" she argues. ""The bus can do that."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It is On the Move day, part of the BBC's Crossing Divides season about bringing people together in a fragmented world. With the help of transport companies, the BBC is encouraging as many people as possible on trains, trams and buses to interact with other passengers or staff. Initiatives include: Virgin Trains designating all coach Cs on its West Coast services as the ""chat coach"" Arriva distributing ""conversation starter"" cards on buses across the country, and encouraging passengers to ""share a smile"" encouraging people from different backgrounds to mix on Translink Northern Ireland's Glider service connecting East and West Belfast National Express deploying actors, poets and games to help trigger conversations on its route 11, which connects Birmingham's most affluent and deprived areas rail companies Greater Anglia and GTR are also taking part, along with Go Ahead buses and Transport for London The intention is to spark thousands of conversations and start a national conversation aimed at breaking down society's barriers and combating loneliness. Prof Nicholas Epley, a behavioural scientist at the University of Chicago Booth School of Business, led research which suggestedcommuters had a ""significantly more positive journeywhen they connected with a stranger than when they sat in solitude"". He replicated the Chicago experiment with 477 rail commuters on Greater Anglia's lines into London for the BBC. ""The results were replicated almost exactly in terms of people's experiences,"" he said. ""The thing we are crystal clear on in our analysis is that the Brits in our experiment enjoyed talking to strangers just as our American participants did."" While accepting many people cherish solitude on their journeys, Crossing Divides season editor Emily Kasriel says On the Move day aims to create a greater sense of belonging and break down barriers in society. ""Contributing to social cohesion is part of the BBC's public purpose,"" she says, adding that participation ""should be fun and is, of course, voluntary."" It's not everybody's cup of tea. ""No thank you. My mornings are for drinking my coffee and listening to music,"" website reader Stephen Mortimer told the BBC. ""Thankfully big headphones generally signal to people that I'm not interested in a conversation."" Another, Vicente, wrote: ""I'm a Londoner. There are over eight million of us living here. I work in an open-plan office with constant interaction. Forgive me for valuing my downtime on public transport by burying my head in a book."" Allow Twitter content?
