RAF veteran says jab is 'no trouble and no pain',"Louis Godwin said receiving the vaccine was ""no trouble at all"" and encouraged others to have it as soon as they could Salisbury Cathedral has been transformed into a vaccination centre with an RAF veteran being one of the first to receive the Covid-19 jab. Former Flight Sergeant Louis Godwin, 95, gave a thumbs-up after being vaccinated in the cathedral, which dates back more than 800 years. ""I was so pleased to get it, especially in a setting like this,"" he said. Organisers were aiming to vaccinate 1,000 people aged over 80 with the Pfizer/BioNTech jab on Saturday. People queuing to receive their vaccines at Salisbury Cathedral on Saturday Mr Godwin, a great-grandfather of 12, joined the RAF aged 18 in 1943 and served as an air gunner during World War Two. ""I've had many jabs in my time, especially in the RAF. After the war, I was sent to Egypt and I had a couple of jabs which knocked me over for a week,"" he said. ""This one, the doctor said to me 'well that's done' and I thought he hadn't started. So it's no trouble at all and no pain."" A health worker prepares the vaccine to be administered at the cathedral Stella Bennett, 88, said she felt ""safer"" after receiving the jab. ""It was easy. I live on my own so it has been hard but I've managed. At least I'm at home and not in hospital with it,"" she said. Derek Burnett was also among those inoculated against the virus on Saturday. ""I feel unbelievably relieved as lockdown has been a big strain. It takes a big weight off my mind,"" said the 81-year-old. Organisers hoped to vaccinate 1,000 people aged over 80 during the day The Very Rev Nicholas Papadopulos, Dean of Salisbury described the vaccines as ""a real sign of hope for us at the end of this very, very difficult year"". ""I doubt that anyone is having a jab in surroundings that are more beautiful than this so I hope it will ease people as they come into the building,"" he said.

Nasa's 'megarocket' engine test ends early,"This video can not be played The four main engines were fired in unison for the first time, but had to be shut down early A critical engine test for Nasa's new ""megarocket"" has ended early, but the agency denied it amounted to a failure. Shortly before 22:30 GMT (17:30 EST) on Saturday, the four engines ignited, burning for more than a minute before the event was aborted. The core stage of the Space Launch System (SLS) was being evaluated at Stennis Space Center, in Mississippi. The engines were supposed to fire for eight minutes to simulate the rocket's climb to orbit. The SLS is part of Nasa's Artemis programme, which aims to put Americans back on the lunar surface in the 2020s. When it makes its maiden flight - possibly later this year - the SLS will become the most powerful rocket ever to have flown to space. Teams at Stennis are still poring over the data to find out what happened. John Honeycutt, SLS program manager at Nasa's Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama, said there were ""a lot of dynamics going on"" when the engine shut down. Nasa's giant SLS rocket: a guide Nasa's new 'megarocket' set for critical tests Artemis: To the Moon and beyond The engines' power levels were being throttled down and up again; they were also being prepared to pivot - or gimbal. This movement allows the rocket to be steered during flight. The RS-25 engines are the same type that powered the space shuttle orbiter ""We did see a little bit of a flash come from around the interface between the thermal protection blanket on engine four at the time when we had initiated the gimbal,"" Honeycutt told reporters at a post-test briefing at Stennis. The as-yet unknown problem triggered what Nasa calls a failure identification (Fid), followed by a major component failure (MCF). As a result of the fault, an onboard computer known as the engine controller sent a message to another computer called the core stage controller, which took a decision to shut down the vehicle. ""Any parameter that went awry on the engine could have sent that failure ID,"" said John Honeycutt. It was the first time all four RS-25 engines had been ignited together, in a test known as a ""hotfire"". The core stage of the rocket was anchored to a massive steel structure called the B-2 test stand on the grounds of the Stennis facility. To prepare the core stage, engineers filled its tanks with more than 700,000 gallons (2.6 million litres) of super-cold liquid hydrogen and oxygen propellant. This was the eighth and final test in the Green Run, a programme of evaluation carried out by engineers from Nasa and Boeing - the rocket's prime contractor. Although the test was intended to run for eight minutes, engineers would have received all the data required to certify the rocket for flight after 250 seconds. They wanted to iron out any problems before the core stage is used for the first SLS launch, in which it will send Nasa's next-generation Orion spacecraft on a loop around the Moon. Nasa's outgoing administrator Jim Bridenstine declined to call Saturday's event a failure: ""This is why we test,"" he said, adding: ""Before we put American astronauts on American rockets, that's when we need it to be perfect."" Officials have not yet decided whether to re-run the hotfire, or proceed with shipping the core stage to Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida to prepare it for the rocket's uncrewed maiden flight, a mission called Artemis-1. ""It depends what the anomaly was and how challenging it's going to be to fix it,"" said Bridenstine. Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine said perfection wasn't a realistic expectation for the first engine test Asked whether a launch this year was still feasible, he added: ""I think it's too early to tell. As we figure out what went wrong, we're going to know what the future holds."" However, if one or more of the engines needs to be replaced, there are spares waiting to be used at Stennis Space Center. The Artemis-1 mission will evaluate how both the SLS and Orion capsule perform prior to Nasa staging a repeat of this lunar loop with astronauts in 2023. This will be followed by the first landing on the Moon by humans since the Apollo 17 mission in 1972. The SLS consists of the 65m (212 ft) -long core stage with two smaller solid rocket boosters (SRBs) attached to the sides. Engineers at KSC have begun stacking the individual SRB segments for Artemis-1. ""This powerful rocket is going to put us in a position to be ready to support the agency and the country in deep space missions to the Moon and beyond,"" John Honeycutt said during a media briefing on Tuesday. Artwork: The initial version of the SLS - known as Block 1 - during the climb to orbit Officials have been planning to ship the core stage to Florida in February. Its engines are of the same type that powered the spaceplane-like shuttle orbiter - America's crewed space vehicle for 30 years from 1981-2011. Nasa is re-using flown hardware: the RS-25 engines used in this test helped launch 21 shuttle missions. Two were used on the last shuttle flight - STS-135 in 2011. The four RS-25s can generate 1.6 million lbs (7 Meganewtons) of thrust - the force that propels a rocket through the air. When the solid rocket boosters are added to the core stage, the combined system will produce 8.8 million pounds (39.1 Meganewtons) of thrust. This will make it 15% more powerful than the giant Saturn V rocket that sent astronauts to the Moon in the 1960s and 70s. Prior to Saturday's test, John Shannon, vice president and SLS program manager at Boeing praised teams at Stennis for keeping the Green Run on track despite the pandemic and this year's particularly active hurricane season.

Funeral by the Mersey for singer Gerry Marsden,"Gerry Marsden on a Mersey ferry in 2009 The funeral of Gerry and the Pacemakers singer Gerry Marsden has been held at a church near his beloved River Mersey. Marsdendied, aged 78, in hospitalon 3 January following a blood infection. As the frontman in the band Gerry and the Pacemakers, his hits included Ferry Cross The Mersey and a cover version of You'll Never Walk Alone. Ex-Liverpool boss Sir Kenny Dalglish was among the mourners at the funeral which had to remain small because of Covid restrictions. Sir Kenny managed the club at the time of the 1989 Hillsborough disaster, which led to the deaths of 96 fans who were attending an FA Cup game between Liverpool and Nottingham Forest. Gerry Marsden sings You'll Never Walk Alone before an Anfield match in 2010 Sir Kenny said: ""You'll Never Walk Alone has huge meaning to the lives of Liverpool supporters around the world and is synonymous with the club. ""He will be sadly missed by those who knew him and the millions he never got to meet."" You'll Never Walk Alone became a football terrace anthem for Marsden's hometown club soon after it topped the charts in 1963. The song was played during the funeral by a guitarist while a version of Marsden singing Don't Let The Sun Catch You Crying, a song he wrote for his wife Pauline, also featured. She said: ""We, his family, are totally devastated and have been so moved and amazed at the extent of the respect, love and affection received from all over the world. ""When the time is right and we have come out of this terrible pandemic we hope a fitting memorial can be held for him in the city he loved so much."" Gerry and the Pacemakers was one of the biggest British bands in the 1960s Referring to the lyrics from Ferry Cross the Mersey, close friend Arthur Johnson said: ""He lived close to the banks of the Mersey for all his life and as the words of his song say: 'This land's the place I love and here I'll stay'."" Liverpool City Region mayor Steve Rotheram said: ""I feel privileged he let me into his life, although that makes his passing even more painful."" In 1962, Beatles manager Brian Epstein signed up Gerry and the Pacemakers and, a year later, they became the first band to have their first three songs top the charts - How Do You Do It, I Like It and You'll Never Walk Alone. A flag on the Royal Iris Mersey ferry flew at half mast after the death of Gerry Marsden They were one of the successes of the Merseybeat era, withformer Beatles star Sir Paul McCartney,externalsaying at the time of Marsden's death that: ""Gerry was a mate from our early days in Liverpool"".

Rise in suspected child abuse cases after lockdownThe number of incidents reported to the child safeguarding panel in England rose by a quarter.UK,"The number of reported incidents of children dying or being seriously harmed after suspected abuse or neglect rose by a quarter after England's first lockdown last year, figures indicate. The Child Safeguarding Practice Review Panelreceived 285 serious incident notifications,externalfrom April to September. This is an increase of 27% from 225 in the same period the previous year. The data also includes children who were in care and died, regardless of whether abuse or neglect was suspected. The Children's Society described the figures as ""shocking"". Vulnerable children in lockdown 'national concern' Lockdown 'sees vulnerable children slip from view' The serious incident notification system requires councils in England to report all incidents of death or serious harm involving children in their area to the Department for Education, which publishes the data. They are also required to inform the education secretary and Ofsted if a looked-after child dies, regardless of whether they suspect abuse or neglect. Child deaths increased from 89 to 119 and those seriously harmed rose from 132 with 153 compared with the same period in 2019, according to the data. The number of serious incidents involving children under one increased by 30% as did the harm suffered by those aged 16 and over. The majority (54%) of incidents related to boys, and almost two thirds related to white children. In two-thirds of the 285 cases reported, the harm occurred while children were living at home. The number of serious incident notifications had fallen in 2019-20 compared with 2018-19 when there were 274 such notifications. Iryna Pona, policy manager at the Children's Society, said the increase in incidents last year happened at a time when Covid-19 was having a ""huge impact on the well-being of children and families and disrupted help available to those who needed it most"". England's first lockdown began at the end of March last year and ended on 4 July. Ms Pona said: ""During the first lockdown many vulnerable children were stuck at home in difficult, sometimes dangerous situations, often isolated from friends and support networks. ""Sadly, children also continued to be targeted and groomed by people outside their families for sexual and criminal exploitation like county lines drug dealing operations, which can lead to serious violence or death. ""At the same time, they were often hidden from view of professionals like social workers and teachers who are best placed to spot the signs if they may be in danger."" She added that in the current lockdown it was ""vital"" that social care and schools work together closely to ensure all vulnerable children, including those in care, have regular contact with a trusted professional. A government spokeswoman said: ""Every single incident of this nature is a tragedy and we are working to understand the impact the pandemic may be having. ""Throughout the past months, we have prioritised the most vulnerable children and their families and put in place support to protect babies. ""We've maintained vital frontline services because we know it has been a challenge for many, especially for new parents, and we've invested thousands of pounds in charities working with vulnerable children and their families. ""Today we have launched a wholescale review of children's social care to reform the system and think afresh about how we support the most vulnerable. This data will provide important information to the care review to help address major challenges.""

India begins world's biggest Covid vaccine drive,"This video can not be played Health workers are the first in line to get Covid jabs A sanitation worker became the first Indian to receive a Covid vaccine as the country began the world's largest inoculation drive. Prime Minister Narendra Modi launched the programme, which aims to vaccinate more than 1.3 billion people against Covid. He paid tribute to front-line workers who will be the first to receive jabs. India has recorded the second-highest number of Covid-19 infections in the world after the United States. Millions of doses of two approved vaccines - Covishield and Covaxin - were shipped across the country in the days leading up to the start of the drive. ""We are launching the world's biggest vaccination drive and it shows the world our capability,"" Mr Modi, said, addressing the country on Saturday morning. A sanitation worker is the first Indian to receive a Covid vaccine He added that India was well prepared to vaccinate its population with the help of an app, which would help the government track the drive and ensure that nobody was left out. Mr Modi spoke at length about doctors, nurses and other front-line workers ""who showed us the light"" in ""dark times"". ""They stayed away from their families to serve humanity. And hundreds of them never went home. They gave their life to save others. And that is why the first jabs are being given to healthcare workers - this is our way of paying respect to them."" Geeta Pandey, BBC News, Delhi Doctors and medical staff at Delhi's Max hospital tell me a lot of hope is being pinned on the vaccination drive. One official described it ""as a new dawn"" and said ""it's the beginning of Covid's end"". Inside the waiting room, there are posters on the wall with information about the documents one needs to bring, how safe the vaccine is, and the precautions that need to be taken even after one's been vaccinated.  Among those being vaccinated on Saturday are doctors, nurses and front-office staff from all departments. The names have been been chosen alphabetically so those getting jabs are mostly those with names starting with the letter A. ""The pandemic has played havoc in the country. I hope the vaccine will rid us of the fears and we will be able to breathe easy,"" Dr Anil Dass said after getting the jab. Ashutosh Chaturvedi, a 31-year-old male nurse described as a ""Covid warrior"" by hospital officials, became the first recipient of the vaccine at Max. ""I'm fine, I feel good,"" he told reporters as he came down the hospital ramp, which has been decorated with blue, green and white balloons. Since April, he told me, he's worked in the emergency wing of the Covid ward, tending to those afflicted with the coronavirus. ""I haven't seen my wife and nine-month-old daughter since then. A month later, once I've received the second dose, I'll visit my family,"" he said. Mr Modi also appealed to people to continue adhering to Covid-19 safety protocols like wearing masks and following social distancing. He said the country cannot afford to be complacent as vaccinating the entire population will take time. He also urged people not to believe any ""propaganda and rumours about the safety of the vaccines"". ""I want to tell people that the approval to these vaccines was given only after scientists and experts were satisfied about its safety,"" he said. An estimated 10 million health workers will be vaccinated in the first round, followed by policemen, soldiers, municipal and other front-line workers. Health workers have been queuing up at vaccination centres for their turn Next in line will be people aged over 50 and anyone under 50 with serious underlying health conditions. India's electoral rolls, which contain details of some 900 million voters, will be used to identify eligible recipients. The government plans to vaccinate 300 million people by early August. This will happen in state-run health care centres, schools, colleges, community halls, municipal offices and wedding halls. Several hospitals across India are giving the first doses of the vaccine. The government plans to vaccinate 300 million people by early August Dr Atul Peters was among those who got the jab at Max hospital. ""It's a very big day. I'm grateful to those who worked hard to make this a reality. I was very very happy when I got a call informing me that my name was on the list. ""We worked hard during the pandemic to save lives and we are also taking the jab first to dispel fears in people's minds that the vaccine is not safe,"" he told the BBC. Millions of vaccine doses have been shipped across India India's drug regulator has given the green light to two vaccines - Covishield (the local name for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine developed in the UK) and Covaxin, locally-made by pharma company Bharat Biotech. But concerns have been raised over the efficacy of Covaxin because theregulator's emergency approval came before the completion of Phase 3 clinical trials. The regulator and the manufacturer have said the vaccine is safe, and that the efficacy data would be available by February. Both vaccines will be given as two injections, 28 days apart, with the second dose being a booster. Immunity would begin to kick in after the first dose but reaches its full effect 14 days after the second dose. The status of the vaccines and recipients will be electronically tracked in real time - some 8 million people who will receive the early jabs have been already registered. More than 600,000 people have been trained for the drive. The jabs will be voluntary, and recipients will be given a certificate of vaccination after they complete both doses. ""I expect India's vaccination programme will be run much better than most countries because of the considerable government investment and earlypreparedness,external,"" Dr Gagandeep Kang, one of India's best-known vaccine experts, told the BBC. With more than 10 million cases, India has recorded the second-highest number of Covid-19 infections in the world, after the US. The largest vaccination drive in the country, however, begins at a time when infections have fallen sharply, and much of life has returned to normal. A limited availability of doses in the initial phase, therefore, is not likely to pose a problem. Most scientists feel India is primed for the challenge as it is a vaccine-making powerhouse and has run, for decades, a well-oiled immunisation programme for tens of millions of new-borns and mothers-to-be. But the real challenges will begin when the general population starts receiving the jabs. India will use its formidable election machinery to deliver and track doses to recipients in far corners of the country. It is also likely to use digital platforms and apps to enable people to register for the doses. However, not every Indian owns a smart phone or knows how to operate an app, so it will be interesting to see what the government does to make sure that there are no inadvertent exclusions. Vaccine hesitancy is the other concern. Health activists Seema Pal and Rama Negi say they have been busting misinformation about the vaccine The recent controversy over the hurried approval of Covaxin, many feel, could undermine confidence. There's a history of hesitancy about receiving the polio vaccine in parts of northern India, triggered by rumours about vaccines being impure and affecting fertility. Similar disinformation is now circulating about Covid vaccines on social networking apps, such as WhatsApp. The government will need consistent, clear-eyed communication to bolster vaccine acceptance and community perception of the programme. Vaccines come with side effects for some people. India has a 34-year-old surveillance programme for monitoring such ""adverse events"" following immunisation. But researchers have found that benchmarks for reporting side effects still remain weak. A failure to transparently report adverse effects could easily lead to fear-mongering around vaccines.

Many police and NHS workers are too concerned with battling the pandemic to look after their mental health, they were told. Insp Phil Spencer from Cleveland Police said staff did not engage enough with counselling ""because we don't want to take anybody else's valuable time"". Prince William said he ""really worries"" about the effect on front-line workers. ""When you're surrounded by that level of intense trauma and sadness and bereavement, it really does, it stays with you at home, it stays with you for weeks on end,"" he said. Insp Spencer said emergency workers ""run towards danger, run towards a terrorist attack, we run towards the pandemic"". ""Perhaps further down the line when all this is gone we're going to have some broken police officers and emergency services staff, because we're too busy focusing on protecting the most vulnerable,"" he said. The couple also spoke to counsellors from Hospice UK's Harrogate-based Just B support line for NHS staff, social care workers, carers and emergency services, which their foundation helps financially. The prince said he feared ""you're all so busy caring for everyone else that you won't take enough time to care for yourselves"". He and Catherine said the stigma surrounding seeking help for mental health issues must end. LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area SOCIAL DISTANCING:Can I give my friends a hug?

UK staycation boom predicted for 2021,"Holiday firms say they are expecting more people to take holidays in the UK this year Staycations are expected to boom in 2021 after lockdown ends, UK holiday firms have said. Bosses at the Caravan and Motorhome Club said the lifting of restrictions would be like ""a cork popping from a bottle"". Director general Nick Lomas said although coronavirus had hit the industry hard, they were optimistic about the coming season. Other firms said they also expected more people to holiday in the UK. Mr Lomas said: ""2020 was a very difficult year for the tourism and hospitality sector."" The West Sussex-based Caravan and Motorhome Club had suffered ""significant financial losses"", he said. However, he added: ""When our campsites were allowed to be open last year we actually saw record levels of bookings, with new memberships up by 14%. ""Sadly, this surge does not make up for the losses we suffered during nearly six months of lockdown."" During the first lockdown popular resorts like Skegness were largely deserted But, despite the current restrictions, Mr Lomas said he had every reason to believe this year could finish as one of ""the best and busiest yet"", due to the appetite for outdoor UK holidays. ""In fact, we think that 2021 is going to be like a cork popping from a bottle,"" he said. Operators say people are keen to experience the ""great outdoors"" once restrictions are lifted Experience Freedom, which operates glamping holidays in the UK, said bookings for 2021 were already up as people looked to spend more time in the ""great outdoors"". Lincoln-based Anne's Vans said they were expecting a ""bumper year"" Smaller operators such as Anne's Vans, based in Lincoln, are also expecting to benefit. Owner Anne Davies said so far they had no bookings, saying ""uncertainty over when lockdown will end"" was putting people off at the moment. However, she said: ""Based on last year's experience we are expecting a bumper year in 2021... once this latest lockdown is over."" The Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority said it was inundated with visitors after restrictions were lifted last year The chief executive of the Yorkshire Dales National Park Authority, David Butterworth, said visitor numbers after the first lockdown ended were ""unprecedented"". ""The challenge for 2021 is to capitalise on this trend, and capture the hearts and minds of the people who have experienced the Dales for the first time to make sure they keep coming back,"" he added.

Archie Lyndhurst died from a brain haemorrhage,"Archie Lyndhurst starred in CBBC sitcom So Awkward CBBC star Archie Lyndhurst, the son of Only Fools and Horses actor Nicholas Lyndhurst, died in his sleep from a brain haemorrhage, his mother has said. Lucy Lyndhurst said a second post-mortem exam had revealed his death was caused by a condition called Acute Lymphoblastic Lymphoma/Leukaemia. She described Archie as ""the most magical human being we have ever met"". The 19-year-old's death on 22 September had had a ""catastrophic effect"" on their family,she wrote on Instagram.,external Archie with his father Nicholas and mother Lucy Smith in 2017 Lucy said she and husband Nicholas were assured by the doctor who explained the post-mortem results to them that there ""wasn't anything anyone could have done as Archie showed no signs of illness"". She said it was ""not leukaemia as we know it"" and that acute in medical terms meant ""rapid"". The couple were ""utterly floored"" to think something like this could happen, she wrote, adding: ""It's very rare and around only 800 people a year die from it."" She said that just days earlier he had been celebrating his birthday with ""the love of his life Nethra"". ""Life is fragile, precious and sometimes incredibly cruel,"" Lucy wrote. She also criticised some media outlets for attempting to garner information about how her son had died from the coroner, before they knew the results of the post mortem themselves. ""To have a coroner call you a few days after your child has died to say the press have been calling for the results of Archie's post mortem, I think stoops to an all time low for us,"" she noted. ""What gives the press the right to badger a coroner's office solely to find the cause of death before the parents? The complete lack of empathy is astounding. We released no information at the time as we had no idea what he had died from."" Nicholas appeared alongside his son in an episode of So Awkward in 2019 Archie began his acting career at the Sylvia Young Theatre School at the age of 10 and was best known for playing Ollie Coulton in the CBBC comedy show So Awkward. He appeared in the sitcom, which followed the lives of a group of friends in secondary school, from its first series in 2015. Nicholas appeared alongside his son in a 2019 episode of the programme.

Rise in suspected child abuse cases after lockdown,"The number of reported incidents of children dying or being seriously harmed after suspected abuse or neglect rose by a quarter after England's first lockdown last year, figures indicate. The Child Safeguarding Practice Review Panelreceived 285 serious incident notifications,externalfrom April to September. This is an increase of 27% from 225 in the same period the previous year. The data also includes children who were in care and died, regardless of whether abuse or neglect was suspected. The Children's Society described the figures as ""shocking"". Vulnerable children in lockdown 'national concern' Lockdown 'sees vulnerable children slip from view' The serious incident notification system requires councils in England to report all incidents of death or serious harm involving children in their area to the Department for Education, which publishes the data. They are also required to inform the education secretary and Ofsted if a looked-after child dies, regardless of whether they suspect abuse or neglect. Child deaths increased from 89 to 119 and those seriously harmed rose from 132 with 153 compared with the same period in 2019, according to the data. The number of serious incidents involving children under one increased by 30% as did the harm suffered by those aged 16 and over. The majority (54%) of incidents related to boys, and almost two thirds related to white children. In two-thirds of the 285 cases reported, the harm occurred while children were living at home. The number of serious incident notifications had fallen in 2019-20 compared with 2018-19 when there were 274 such notifications. Iryna Pona, policy manager at the Children's Society, said the increase in incidents last year happened at a time when Covid-19 was having a ""huge impact on the well-being of children and families and disrupted help available to those who needed it most"". England's first lockdown began at the end of March last year and ended on 4 July. Ms Pona said: ""During the first lockdown many vulnerable children were stuck at home in difficult, sometimes dangerous situations, often isolated from friends and support networks. ""Sadly, children also continued to be targeted and groomed by people outside their families for sexual and criminal exploitation like county lines drug dealing operations, which can lead to serious violence or death. ""At the same time, they were often hidden from view of professionals like social workers and teachers who are best placed to spot the signs if they may be in danger."" She added that in the current lockdown it was ""vital"" that social care and schools work together closely to ensure all vulnerable children, including those in care, have regular contact with a trusted professional. A government spokeswoman said: ""Every single incident of this nature is a tragedy and we are working to understand the impact the pandemic may be having. ""Throughout the past months, we have prioritised the most vulnerable children and their families and put in place support to protect babies. ""We've maintained vital frontline services because we know it has been a challenge for many, especially for new parents, and we've invested thousands of pounds in charities working with vulnerable children and their families. ""Today we have launched a wholescale review of children's social care to reform the system and think afresh about how we support the most vulnerable. This data will provide important information to the care review to help address major challenges.""

GPs warned about delay to batch of Covid vaccines,"This video can not be played How will I get my Covid-19 vaccine in Wales? GPs in north Wales are being advised to consider delaying Covid-19 vaccine appointments early next week due to a hold-up affecting about 26,000 doses. Betsi Cadwaladr health board, which manages healthcare in the area, said it was a national issue which was expected to be ""resolved in the coming days"". The Welsh Government said one Oxford-AstraZeneca batch out of four had been delayed. It had been due to be shared between Wales' seven health boards. It said rollout plans were unaffected. The Welsh Government said it had been assured it would get more Pfizer vaccines by February, despite shipments of it beingtemporarily slowedbecause of changes to the company's manufacturing processes. Four per cent of the Welsh population have received a vaccine so far. Chris Stockport, executive director primary and community care at Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, said the organisation was ""notified of a delay in releasing a batch of vaccines which would have disrupted supply nationally in the middle of next week"". Will mass Covid testing be offered across Wales? When, where and how will I get my Covid vaccine? Case rates fall in Covid hotspots as 54 people die ""To help minimise disruption and anxiety, we informed GP practices of this supply issue at the earliest opportunity, and suggested they may wish to delay appointments early next week,"" he said. ""We expect that this issue will be resolved in the coming days, and we expect a further allocation of vaccines will arrive over the coming week. ""We are now in the process of working with our partners in primary care to minimise any disruption and continue the rollout of vaccinations across north Wales."" UK government figuresshow 126,375 people in Wales, 4% of the population, have received their first jab so far. The Welsh Government'svaccine strategysays everyone will be offered a jab by autumn. It is not known why one of four batches has been held up. Dr Phil White, chair of BMA Wales' general practitioners' committee which represents doctors, said it was ""not unprecedented"" for a batch of vaccines to be withheld, as happened with flu vaccines in 2019. He said almost one million flu vaccines have been administered this season, so 26,000 Covid vaccines was a ""tiny amount"" which would be made up. ""It's really an inconvenience and will lead to some appointments being cancelled but, hopefully, we can make up for that as soon as the batch is replaced,"" he said. A Welsh Government spokeswoman confirmed each batch contains about 26,000 doses. She said it would not affect its plan to vaccinate priority groups by mid-February. ""We were recently notified that one of the four batches of the vaccine we had anticipated receiving this week will be delayed, and not available until the week commencing 25 January,"" she said. ""This does not affect our overall expected delivery volumes or expectations for hitting the milestones set out in ourCovid-19 Vaccination Strategy for Wales,external."" Meanwhile,several EU countries have said they are receiving significantly fewer dosesof thePfizer vaccinesthan expected after the US company slowed shipments. But the Welsh Government said it has been ""assured"" by the UK government that it will receive further Pfizer vaccines by February. ""We are aware of a slowing down in supply from Pfizer's European production which may have implications on the rate at which we can vaccinate more people as we move to administer the second doses,"" said the spokeswoman. Wales has received about 250,000 doses of thePfizer/BioNTech vaccineand 50,000 doses of theOxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, according to First Minister Mark Drakeford. This video can not be played Mark Drakeford says there is âsignificant evidenceâ of coronavirus transmission in supermarkets He told Friday's Welsh Government briefing a further supply of Pfizer vaccines was expected in late January or earlier February, along with a ""significant upswing in the Oxford vaccine coming to Wales next week"". Regarding the Pfizer vaccine, he said: ""What you can't do is to try and stand up a system which uses all the vaccines you've got in week one and then has nothing to offer for the next four weeks. ""That's why you haven't seen it all used in week one because we've got to space it out over the weeks that it's got to cover."" But Paul Davies, leader of the Conservatives in the Senedd, said it was""clear we are lagging behind""the rest of the UK in Covid vaccinations. He said it was ""important now to get those vaccines out to people"". Plaid Cymru has said it makes ""little sense"" to spread out the vaccines, when ""time is of the essence"". ""The Welsh Government must set out and make public a clearer and more comprehensive strategy on vaccines,"" said Plaid's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth. ""This can help ensure that the priority groups are being vaccinated as quickly as possible, so we can move on to other groups of essential workers."" Will mass Covid testing be offered across Wales?

All 50 US states on alert for armed protests,"This video can not be played The US Capitol is on high alert ahead of Biden's inauguration All 50 US states and the District of Columbia (DC) are on alert for possible violent protests this weekend, ahead of President-elect Joe Biden's inauguration on Wednesday. National Guard troops have been sent en masse to Washington DC, to deter any repeat of last week's deadly riots. The FBI has warned of possible armed marches by pro-Trump supporters at all 50 state capitols. Meanwhile, the Biden team has set out plans to reverse key Trump policies. In the hours after Mr Biden sets foot in the White House, he will embark on a blitz of executive actions designed to signal a clean break from his predecessor's administration, according to a memo seen by US media. Among the actions: He will return the US to the Paris climate agreement - a global pact on cutting carbon emissions He will repeal the controversial travel ban on a list of mostly Muslim-majority countries He will make wearing masks mandatory on federal property and when travelling interstate Although Mr Biden, like President Trump, will be able to use executive orders as a means of bypassing Congress on some issues,his $1.9tn (Â£1.4tn) stimulus planannounced earlier this week will need to be approved by lawmakers, as will a bill on immigration reform. Much of Washington DC will be locked down ahead of Wednesday's inauguration, with National Guard troops deploying in their thousands. What are far-right Trump supporters saying? At the Capitol: Trump's Christian supporters Who has the FBI arrested so far? Many streets - some miles from the Capitol, the site of deadly rioting on 6 January - have been blocked off with concrete barriers and metal fences. The National Mall, which is usually thronged with thousands of people for inaugurations, has been shut at the request of the Secret Service - the agency charged with protecting the president. The Biden team had already asked Americans to avoid travelling to the nation's capital for the inauguration because of the Covid-19 pandemic. Local officials said people should watch the event remotely. Sunday is expected to also be a particular focus for protests, after posts on pro-Trump and far-right online networks called for armed demonstrations on that day. Some militias have told their followers not to attend, however, citing heavy security or claiming the planned events are police traps. Capitol Police confirmed on Saturday that an armed Virginia man carrying a ""non-government issued credential"" had been stopped and arrested at a security checkpoint on Friday with at least one gun and 509 rounds of ammunition. But the man, named Wesley Allen Beeler, was later released from custody andtold the Washington Post that he did not intend to bring a firearm into Washington,external, where he said he had been working with a private security firm. ""I pulled up to a checkpoint after getting lost in DC because I'm a country boy,"" he said. ""I showed them the inauguration badge that was given to me."" Barricades are being assembled around the US Capitol ahead of the 20 January inauguration of Joe Biden and Kamala Harris The tough security measures follow a week in which Donald Trump became the first US president to be impeached twice.He now faces a Senate trial, on a charge of ""incitement of insurrection"" linked to the storming of the US Capitol by groups of his supporters. They did so in a bid to thwart Congress certifying Joe Biden's victory in the presidential election. When will Trump go on trial in the Senate? Dozens of arrests have been made in relation to the assault on the Capitol building. Among the latest is a far-right media personality known as Baked Alaska - real name Anthime Joseph Gionet.A criminal complaint says,externalhe was arrested in Houston, Texas on Friday and charged with two federal crimes, including violent entry and disorderly conduct on Capitol grounds. States across the country are also taking precautionary measures, from boarding up capitol windows to refusing to grant permits for rallies. The governors of Maryland, New Mexico and Utah have all declared states of emergency ahead of possible protests at their legislatures. California, Pennsylvania, Michigan, Virginia, Washington and Wisconsin are among those activating their National Guards, and Texas will shut its state capitol from Saturday until after inauguration day. A fence is being put up around the Michigan state capitol in Lansing According to the director of the Texas Department of Public Safety, intelligence suggested ""violent extremists"" could infiltrate planned protests there to ""conduct criminal acts"". Virginia's Governor Ralph Northam told a news conference on Thursday: ""If you're planning to come here or up to Washington with ill intent in your heart, you need to turn around right now and go home. You are not welcome here, and you're not welcome in our nation's capital. And if you come here and act out, Virginia will be ready."" Analysts believe states that saw especially hostile or protracted election battles are at most risk of violence. One of them, Michigan, has erected a six-foot fence around its capitol in Lansing. ""We are prepared for the worst, but we remain hopeful that those who choose to demonstrate at our capitol do so peacefully,"" the state's Police Director Joe Gasper said on Friday. The building will have an increased police presence until at least mid-February, he added. In October,six men were arrested for allegedly plotting to kidnap and overthrow Michigan Governor Gretchen Whitmer, a Democrat. The group planned to gather about ""200 men"" to storm the capitol building and take hostages, investigators said. In a further development on Saturday, Facebook said it would temporarily halt adverts for gun accessories and military kit in the US. The site had already banned adverts for guns and ammunition. ""Out of an abundance of caution, we are temporarily banning ads promoting weapons accessories and protective equipment in the US until at least January 22nd,"" spokesperson Liz Bourgeois told Buzzfeed. The move came after three senators and four attorneys general urged Facebook to stop ""placing profit ahead of our Nation's democracy"". What are far-right Trump supporters saying?

Patel: Work to restore lost police records ongoing,"Work to restore hundreds of thousands of fingerprint, DNA and arrest records accidentally wiped from police databases is ongoing, the Home Office has said. Around 400,000 records were lost,according to The Times,external, which first reported the story. The Home Office did not comment on how many records were likely to be restored, or how long it would take. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the issue was ""a result of human error"". Data was wiped from the Police National Computer (PNC) - which stores and shares criminal records information across the UK - after being inadvertently flagged for deletion. The PNC is used in police investigations and provides real-time checks on people, vehicles and crimes, as well as whether suspects are wanted for any unsolved offences. The coding that caused the problem was introduced in November 2020, and the deletions started earlier this week. Initially, it was thought some 150,000 records were lost, but it since has emerged the number could be significantly higher. Technical issue sees police records lost Police probes compromised after records deleted Commenting on the error, Ms Patel said: ""Engineers continue to work to restore data lost as a result of human error during a routine housekeeping process earlier this week. ""I continue to be in regular contact with the team, and working with our policing partners, we will provide an update as soon as we can."" Earlier, Labour shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds called on Ms Patel to take responsibility for the error and be clear about the impact it had had. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, he described the situation as ""extraordinarily serious"", adding: ""Priti Patel will be responsible for criminals walking free. ""We're not going to be able to link suspects to crime scenes without the DNA and fingerprint evidence."" TheNational Police Chiefs' Council saidthe lost data had resulted in a couple of ""near misses"" for serious crimes when trying to identify an offender. Policing minister Kit Malthouse insisted the affected records ""apply to cases where individuals were arrested and then released with no further action"". He added: ""We are working to recover the affected records as a priority. While we do so, the Police National Computer is functioning and the police are taking steps to mitigate any impact.""

Mountaineer Nimsdai Purja, a member of the group, said they reached the peak at 17:00 local time (12:00 GMT). Dozens of climbers have been on the 8,611m (28,251ft) mountain this winter hoping to achieve the same feat. But one Spanish mountaineer has died after suffering a fall this weekend while descending. K2, which is only 200m shorter than Everest, is part of the Karakoram Range that straddles the Pakistan-China border. One of only 14 mountains higher than 8,000m, it is widely considered the most demanding of all in winter. It has long been referred to as ""the savage mountain"", a name that stuck after US mountaineer George Bell said of his own attempt in 1953: ""It is a savage mountain that tries to kill you."" Among the most treacherous sections is the notorious ""bottleneck"", a couloir liable to icefalls. Eleven climbers were killed there in an avalanche in 2008. Left out to freeze on K2 K2 climber aborts solo winter ascent Irish climbers conquer peak within 24 hours of each other The Nepali climbers were initially spread across three of four competing teams - in all, totalling 60 people. But the 10 Nepalis later formed into a single group to claim the historic achievement in Nepal's name. Mountaineer Nirmal Purja - a former member of the UK's Special Boat Service -shared an image,externalof the group celebrating their achievement, which was confirmed by expedition organiser Seven Summit Treks. ""We are proud to have been a part of history for humankind and to show that collaboration, teamwork and a positive mental attitude can push limits to what we feel might be possible,"" said Mr Purja. K2 is one of 14 mountains in the world more than 8,000 metres (26,246ft) in height Since the first attempt in 1987-1988, just a handful of winter expeditions have been attempted on K2. Until now, none has reached higher than 7,650 metres. Nepali guides, usually ethnic Sherpas, are considered the backbone of the climbing industry around the Himalayas, and regularly help foreign mountaineers on expeditions. News of the group's success on Saturday has been praised on social media and sparked joy within the Nepalese climbing community - often left out of the spotlight. ""For decades, Nepalis have assisted foreigners to reach the summits of the Himalayas, but we've not been getting the recognition we deserve,"" said Kami Rita, speaking to AFP. ""It is wonderful that today on K2 10 Nepalis have made history and shown our bravery and strength,"" added Mr Rita, who has climbed Everest a record 24 times. As news of their success broke, it was also confirmed that another climber, Spaniard Sergi Mingote, died after experiencing a severe fall. Mr Mingote, 49, was based with another team and had been descending to K2's base camp when he slipped and fell. An experienced mountaineer, Mr Mingote had previously climbed seven of the world's so-called ""8000ers"", including Everest. He had been attempting to summit K2 without oxygen but became severely fatigued, forcing him to abandon the expedition.

Will mass Covid testing be offered across Wales?,"Hundreds queued around the leisure centre in Merthyr Tydfil to get tested in November People queued around the side of a leisure centre to be mass-tested for Covid when Merthyr Tydfil was considered a hotspot in November, and the Army was drafted in to help. UK Health Secretary Matt Hancock has credited this method of ""lateral flow"" testing for asymptomatic people with lowering case rates in Liverpool, another Covid hotspot. He has since announced these regular rapid tests would beused in communities across England. But are they likely to be rolled out across Wales? Asymptomatic South Wales Police officers face tests NHS rapid test use defended amid accuracy concerns The lateral flow tests give a result within half an hour It is a quick way of testing for coronavirus symptoms and returns a result in about 30 minutes. This means those who have been in close contact with someone who has tested positive will not have to self-isolate if their test comes back negative. Instead of having to self-isolate, they could remain at work or in the classroom if they tested negative with a lateral flow test each morning. Test centres in the Lower Cynon Valley were open until 20 December An article in theBMJ medical journal,externalraised concerns about the effects of rapid testing in Liverpool, where a pilot scheme was carried out. The lateral flow tests, which do not require processing in a laboratory, were reported to have missed half of all cases and a third of those with a high viral load who were likely to be the most infectious. Angela Raffle, a consultant in public health at the University of Bristol medical school, also said increasinglateral flow testing was ""very worrying""and warned the benefits of finding symptomless cases ""will be outweighed by the many more infectious cases that are missed by these tests"". However Susan Hopkins, chief medical adviser to NHS Test and Trace in England, said the lateral flow tests could identify many cases of infection in people without symptoms. While she admittedthere were ""false"" negatives""and the method had ""limitations"", Dr Hopkins said its use was a ""gamechanger"". Council and military personnel helped with a mass testing pilot in Merthyr Tydfil Mass testing pilots were run in two Covid hotspots in Wales at the end of last year. On the first day oftesting in Merthyr Tydfilin November, 977 people were tested and nine of them were positive. Mass testing followedin the Lower Cynon Valleyin December. Across both areas, a total of 1,100 positive Covid cases were identified after 50,000 lateral flow tests were carried out. The Welsh Government also starteda four-week pilot of routinely testing asymptomaticSouth Wales Police officers on 23 December. Its aim was to reduce the numbers off work self-isolating, despite not being infected, following contact with a person who has tested positive. While the trial is still ongoing, the Welsh Government said results so far showed a steady decline in Covid-related absences. Regular testing of asymptomatic health and social care workers has also begun, and a pilot scheme is under way at the Tata Steel site in Port Talbot. There were also plansto roll it out in schools and collegesacross Wales in January, if they had opened as originally planned. The lateral flow testing method has been used widely during the pandemic Lateral flow tests have been made availablein all 317 of England's local authority areasfrom this week as part of a community testing regime. Councils have been encouraged to prioritise tests for those people who cannot work from home during the lockdown. The Scottish governmentis also offering community testing,externalin areas that have high prevalence of coronavirus. Mass community testing has been trialled in Covid hotspot Merthyr Tydfil A Welsh Government spokeswoman said officials were evaluating the results of pilots and initiatives, and looking at what was happening in other parts of the UK as it develops its approach to community testing. However, a number of more targeted schemes are currently operating. ""We have announced regular asymptomatic testing of health and social care workers, in education and daily contact testing in South Wales Police,"" the spokeswoman added. ""A pilot has also started at the Tata Port Talbot site. ""We are also exploring other opportunities for regular testing to support critical services."" Rhondda Cynon Taf has had the highest number of Covid-19 deaths in Wales The Welsh Conservatives have called for lateral flow testing to be ""ramped up"" in hospitals. Health spokesman Andrew RT Davies said in December: ""Hospitals are reporting high percentages of staff self-isolating, and therefore putting increasing strain on services and remaining staff."" Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price hasraised the need for ""Covid Support Areas""- saying research from the north of England suggested post-industrial communities may be disproportionately affected by the virus. In line with this, he called for mass testing as well as more financial support in areas such as Merthyr Tydfil, Blaenau Gwent and Rhondda Cynon Taf.

"Patel: Work to restore lost police records ongoingHundreds of thousands of DNA and arrest records were deleted after a human error, the Home Office says.UK","Work to restore hundreds of thousands of fingerprint, DNA and arrest records accidentally wiped from police databases is ongoing, the Home Office has said. Around 400,000 records were lost,according to The Times,external, which first reported the story. The Home Office did not comment on how many records were likely to be restored, or how long it would take. Home Secretary Priti Patel said the issue was ""a result of human error"". Data was wiped from the Police National Computer (PNC) - which stores and shares criminal records information across the UK - after being inadvertently flagged for deletion. The PNC is used in police investigations and provides real-time checks on people, vehicles and crimes, as well as whether suspects are wanted for any unsolved offences. The coding that caused the problem was introduced in November 2020, and the deletions started earlier this week. Initially, it was thought some 150,000 records were lost, but it since has emerged the number could be significantly higher. Technical issue sees police records lost Police probes compromised after records deleted Commenting on the error, Ms Patel said: ""Engineers continue to work to restore data lost as a result of human error during a routine housekeeping process earlier this week. ""I continue to be in regular contact with the team, and working with our policing partners, we will provide an update as soon as we can."" Earlier, Labour shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds called on Ms Patel to take responsibility for the error and be clear about the impact it had had. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, he described the situation as ""extraordinarily serious"", adding: ""Priti Patel will be responsible for criminals walking free. ""We're not going to be able to link suspects to crime scenes without the DNA and fingerprint evidence."" TheNational Police Chiefs' Council saidthe lost data had resulted in a couple of ""near misses"" for serious crimes when trying to identify an offender. Policing minister Kit Malthouse insisted the affected records ""apply to cases where individuals were arrested and then released with no further action"". He added: ""We are working to recover the affected records as a priority. While we do so, the Police National Computer is functioning and the police are taking steps to mitigate any impact.""

'I caught Covid - and my father-in-law died',"Everyone has heard about doctors and nurses catching Covid-19 but some of the worst affected hospital staff have been cleaners and porters. Dr John Wright of Bradford Royal Infirmary tells the story of a cleaner who became ill, and is now stricken with guilt for taking the virus home. The first person I see early each morning when I arrive at the hospital is our cleaner, Karen Smith. During 10 months of uncertainty, Karen has been the one constant, apart from a few weeks in spring, when she was ill with Covid-19. Usually Karen cleans the offices of the hospital's Institute for Health Research, but in the first wave of the pandemic she was called to the Covid wards. It was a frightening time for everyone, but Karen volunteered for an extra shift on Good Friday as there was a staff shortage - and on that day she thinks she was infected. We know that working in hospitalsincreases your risk of infection by a factor of three,external, but this risk is not evenly spread. Antibody tests carried out in many NHS hospitals over the summer showed it was not the ICU consultants or infectious ""red zone"" clinical staff who had the highest rate of infection, but porters and cleaners working in those areas. Their risk of infection wasdouble that of their clinical colleagues,external. This heightened risk for hospital staff also applies to their household contacts. Karen and her husband, Mal As she cleaned the hospital in April, Karen was scared not for herself, but for her family. She and her husband, Mal, had moved into a caravan in Mal's parents' garden, while his mother was ill with cancer - and they stayed on after she died, to support Mal's 80-year-old father, Malcolm. Mal, a hospital porter, was shielding because he has chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and Malcolm senior was clearly vulnerable because of his age. Stopping work, however, was not a luxury Karen could afford. And unlike some hospital staff who were housed in hotels to protect their families, she went back home every night. She became ill towards the end of April, followed by Mal at the beginning of May. The weather was hot, she remembers, as they coughed and wheezed in the caravan. ""It was like being in a tin box,"" she says. ""I got Covid and couldn't get over it properly. And then Mal got it and his was on another level compared to mine - and then his dad got ill, and that was a different ball game altogether."" Prof John Wright, a doctor and epidemiologist, is head of the Bradford Institute for Health Research, and a veteran of cholera, HIV and Ebola epidemics in sub-Saharan Africa. He is writing this diary for BBC News and recording from the hospital wards for BBC Radio. Listen to Karen's story in theCoronavirus Front Line, on BBC World Service, from 2 February Or read the previous online diary entry:'Close to death from Covid, I asked them to save my baby' Find all the diary entries on the BBC Radio 4 website The couple had to go inside the house to cook and to use the bathroom but did their best to keep away from the elderly Malcolm, who would go into a different room whenever they entered. ""We tried so, so hard not to give it to him - but then he got ill and he just went to his bed. Honestly, he was just like a little child, under the quilt looking all bewildered. He started with the shivers and we rang 111. They said to bring him to Accident and Emergency to get him tested, and we couldn't believe it when it came back positive,"" Karen says. Later, he was brought into hospital. I have fond memories of meeting Malcolm on the ward after he was admitted, acutely struggling with symptoms of cough and shortness of breath from his Covid infection. He was a kind and gentle man, stoical and patient. He was adamant that he had been careful to keep his distance from Karen and Mal in the house, but admitted wandering over to show them articles in the Telegraph and Argus - Bradford's daily newspaper - whenever I was mentioned in it. I felt strangely culpable that I might have been the cause of the transmission. Malcolm made a good recovery and was eager to be discharged. But Covid is an unpredictable illness, and it can happen that improvements in a patient's condition are followed by a sharp deterioration. And this is what happened with Malcolm soon after he arrived home. ""He didn't want to go back into hospital - he said to get him some Tunes because they would help him breathe,"" says Karen. ""But nothing could help him, he was so, so ill. We had to say to him, 'No, you've got Covid and you need proper medical care.' He was such a lovely man, bless him."" Malcolm was readmitted after two nights at home and died on 28 May. Malcolm as he turned 80, visiting his brother in Canada Karen returned to work. But like many people who have had this illness, she has been suffering the after-effects, both physically and mentally. She's now on an inhaler for breathlessness, can barely taste anything seven months later, and is constantly tired. She is also receiving medication for anxiety because of the fear that she will have to return to the Covid wards, where potentially she could get ill again. And in her case there is the added pain of having lost a loved one, mixed with feelings of guilt. ""When I start to think about him the tears come and sometimes I'll be crying almost all day - cleaning and crying. If I'm having a bad day, I won't be able to talk,"" she says. ""The guilt is always there, as I'll never know for sure where he picked it up. Mal's dad didn't set foot out of the door, and so in my head I feel such guilt, because we had to go into the house, we didn't have any choice. I go over it all but it's hard to escape from, because I got it, Mal got it and then his Dad got it. Deep down I think that's what's happened, and it will take time to come to terms with."" Karen has been referred for counselling, but there is a long waiting list. Both Karen and Mal also had to wait for the vaccine, though both had it on Wednesday. This was a huge relief for Karen, as anything that reduces her chance of reinfection also helps her cope with her anxiety. If NHS trusts are serious about following the science then arguably they should be vaccinating cleaners and porters first. The fear of transmitting the virus to our loved ones at home is the ghost that haunts all front-line staff.Many went into isolation during the first wave, but this was never a sustainable approach, and with a virus that is so contagious and an environment in which it is so prevalent, transmission to family members is unfortunately common. Karen and Mal personify this occupational risk, and its potential deadly impact.

Our coronavirus live page will be back tomorrow morning. The live page writers were Victoria Lindrea, Kelly-Leigh Cooper and Alex Therrien. The page was edited by James Clarke. We'll soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a pause for the day. But before we do, here is a round-up of today's main stories:  Bex Tonks said tens of thousands of eggs were at risk of being wasted Tens of thousands of free-range eggs are being donated to food banks by a farm in Cornwall that has seen demand plummet. St Ewe farm is home to 180,000 laying hens, but orders from the hospitality sector have dried up and the eggs are at risk of being wasted. So the farm has begun a campaign to avoid throwing them away, pointing out that hens ""can't be furloughed"". It is selling trays at a reduced rate and simultaneously donating a carton to a food bank or community kitchen for each sale. Bex Tonks, CEO of St Ewe said the ""Shell Out to Help Out"" campaign gave 20,000 eggs away last week, adding that it was ""really important to feed those who need it most"". ""It's tough times but we're all looking forward,"" she says. Louis Godwin descibed the vaccine as ""no trouble at all"" An RAF veteran has been among hundreds of people over 80 to receive the Covid-19 vaccine at Salisbury Cathedral, in Wiltshire, today. Former Flight Sergeant Louis Godwin described receiving the Pfizer/BioNTech jab as ""absolutely marvellous"". The landmark cathedral is hosting a vaccination hub for five GP surgeries in the area, with the aim of vaccinating more than 1,000 elderly residents and staff. Mr Godwin recalled having jabs in Egypt after the war ""which knocked me over for a week"". ""This one, the doctor said to me 'well that's done' - and I thought he hadn't started!"" The veteran pilot, who has 12 great-grandchildren, said the pandemic could not be compared to the war. ""It was entirely different because this has divided people. ""The vaccine is nothing, you don't feel a thing... so anybody that needs one and can get one, I would say go ahead and do it quickly. ""It's the only way we're going to beat the virus."" Patients queued for a short time around the cloisters on Saturday, before going into the cathedral where they were treated to a programme of music on the famous Father Willis organ. ""It is a bonus to be in such a iconic, wonderful place,"" said Dr Dan Henderson, co-clinical director for the Sarum South Primary Care Network. ""It's great to be getting the vaccine out there and getting them in people's arms and knowing that this is hopefully the start of some sort of normality again."" Karen Smith thinks she was infected on an extra shift she did because of staff shortages Everyone has heard about doctors and nurses catching Covid-19, but some of the worst affected hospital staff have been cleaners and porters. Dr John Wright of Bradford Royal Infirmary tells the story of a cleaner who became ill, and is now stricken with guilt for taking the virus home. The first person I see early each morning when I arrive at the hospital is our cleaner, Karen Smith. During 10 months of uncertainty, Karen has been the one constant, apart from a few weeks in spring, when she was ill with Covid-19. Usually Karen cleans the offices of the hospital's Institute for Health Research, but in the first wave of the pandemic she was called to the Covid wards. It was a frightening time for everyone, but Karen volunteered for an extra shift on Good Friday as there was a staff shortage. And on that day she thinks she was infected. Read more about Karen's case Corey Johnson died Thursday night and Dustin Higgs on Saturday morning Two US prisoners held on federal death row have been executed despite both testing positive for Covid-19 last month. Lawyers for both men argued their sentences should be delayed because damage to their lungs could mean the lethal dose of pentobarbital given to them leading to heightened suffering in their last moments, akin to a drowning sensation. A court ordered a stay of execution on these grounds earlier this week but the decision was overturned following a US government appeal. The number of reported incidents of children dying or being seriously harmed after suspected abuse or neglect rose by a quarter after England's first lockdown last year, figures indicate. The Child Safeguarding Practice Review Panelreceived 285 serious incident notifications,externalfrom April to September. This is an increase of 27% from the same period the previous year. The data also includes children who were in care and died, regardless of whether abuse or neglect was suspected. The Children's Society described the figures as ""shocking"". Read more Earlier this hour, the government released its daily UK coronavirus figures, which included a further 1,295 deaths. There are 37,475 Covid-19 patients in hospital. And as the below graphics show, while deaths are continuing to rise, there are signs daily cases may be falling. And you can read more here.  Portugal has registered a record rise of 10,947 new cases and 166 deaths on Saturday  - one day after a new national lockdown began. The Observador newspaper reports thatthree Lisbon area hospitals only had three intensive care beds left on Saturday,externaland queues of ambulances have been reported in places. Portugal has the lowest critical care capacity per 100,000 in Europe and experts warn hospital rates are likely to rise over the next week following a surge in cases after Christmas. The country was included in a travel ban implemented by the UK government this weekover fears of a new variant identified in Brazil. Along with the number of new deaths and cases, there was some more positive news in the government's daily coronavirus figures. The number of vaccinations in the UK up to 15 January now stands at 3,559,179 - up from 3,234,946 yesterday. Mike Hind paid for the meals himself as he had no time to fundraise A fitness trainer has responded to the outcry over inadequate free school food parcels by donating 3,000 meals. Images of the contents of some packages - given to children in England who qualify for free school meals and are learning remotely during the lockdown - have been shared and roundly criticised on social media. Mike Hind, 37, from Teesside, says the pictures he saw made him think: ""This is for a rabbit, not a child."" He paid for the meals himself because there was no time to fundraise but a local dairy donated milk and Morrisons supermarket donated fruit, he says. ""I've had people who've been walking two and three miles for these meals,"" he says. Read more A further 1,295 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test,according to the latest government figures,external. It takes the death toll by this measure to 88,590. A further 41,346 cases have been reported. There have been a total of 3,357, 361 cases. Some 5,000 Covid vaccinations are being given to health and social care staff on Saturday at a newly-created mass vaccination centre in Glasgow. The NHS Louisa Jordan is a temporary hospital constructed last year to treat Covid patients at Glasgow's SEC exhibition and conference centre.

Some 3,514,385 Covid-19 vaccinations have taken place in England since 8 December, according to provisional NHS England data. The figure, for jabs up to and including yesterday, includes first and second doses and is a rise of 324,711 on the statistics from 24 hours earlier. Of this number, 3,090,058 were the first dose of the vaccine, a rise of 320,894 on Friday's figures, while 424,327 were the second dose, an increase of 3,817. Pakistan's health minister, Faisal Sultan, says the country has given emergency use authorisation to the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca - making it the first to be approved nationally. The Drug
Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) is also currently reviewing the Chinese-made Sinopharm vaccine - with more than one million doses already ordered. Mr Sultan told Reuters that the country was speaking to a number of vaccine producers around the world: ""We have and are
watching the evolving stories around efficacy of a number of
vaccines."" Pakistan has confirmed more than 516,000 cases and almost 11,000 deaths so far. Doctors and nurses should be protected from legal action over treatment decisions made under the pressures of the pandemic, medical bodies have said. The British Medical Association (BMA) is among the groups that have written to ministers, saying medical workers should not be at risk of unlawful killing charges. In November, Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned that in the face of the NHS being overwhelmed, ""doctors and nurses could be forced to choose which patients to treat, who would live and who would die"". A joint letter, co-ordinated by the Medical Protection Society (MPS), said - given the current public health emergency - medical staff were concerned ""that not only do they face being put in this position but also that they could subsequently be vulnerable to a criminal investigation by the police"". The letter was signed by the BMA, the Doctors' Association UK, the Hospital Consultants and Specialists' Association, the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin and Medical Defence Shield. It calls for emergency legislation to protect doctors and nurses from ""inappropriate"" legal action when dealing with circumstances outside their control. They said the change in the law should be temporary and should apply retrospectively from the start of the pandemic. The government said staff would be protected by indemnity schemes. Read more.

"Nepali climbers make history with K2 winter summitTill now, K2 was the only mountain higher than 8,000m not to be conquered in winter.Asia","The Nepali climbers are the first to summit K2 during its dangerous winter season A team of 10 Nepali climbers has set a new world record by becoming the first to reach the summit of K2, the world's second highest mountain, in winter. Mountaineer Nimsdai Purja, a member of the group, said they reached the peak at 17:00 local time (12:00 GMT). Dozens of climbers have been on the 8,611m (28,251ft) mountain this winter hoping to achieve the same feat. But one Spanish mountaineer has died after suffering a fall this weekend while descending. K2, which is only 200m shorter than Everest, is part of the Karakoram Range that straddles the Pakistan-China border. One of only 14 mountains higher than 8,000m, it is widely considered the most demanding of all in winter. It has long been referred to as ""the savage mountain"", a name that stuck after US mountaineer George Bell said of his own attempt in 1953: ""It is a savage mountain that tries to kill you."" Among the most treacherous sections is the notorious ""bottleneck"", a couloir liable to icefalls. Eleven climbers were killed there in an avalanche in 2008. Left out to freeze on K2 K2 climber aborts solo winter ascent Irish climbers conquer peak within 24 hours of each other The Nepali climbers were initially spread across three of four competing teams - in all, totalling 60 people. But the 10 Nepalis later formed into a single group to claim the historic achievement in Nepal's name. Mountaineer Nirmal Purja - a former member of the UK's Special Boat Service -shared an image,externalof the group celebrating their achievement, which was confirmed by expedition organiser Seven Summit Treks. ""We are proud to have been a part of history for humankind and to show that collaboration, teamwork and a positive mental attitude can push limits to what we feel might be possible,"" said Mr Purja. K2 is one of 14 mountains in the world more than 8,000 metres (26,246ft) in height Since the first attempt in 1987-1988, just a handful of winter expeditions have been attempted on K2. Until now, none has reached higher than 7,650 metres. Nepali guides, usually ethnic Sherpas, are considered the backbone of the climbing industry around the Himalayas, and regularly help foreign mountaineers on expeditions. News of the group's success on Saturday has been praised on social media and sparked joy within the Nepalese climbing community - often left out of the spotlight. ""For decades, Nepalis have assisted foreigners to reach the summits of the Himalayas, but we've not been getting the recognition we deserve,"" said Kami Rita, speaking to AFP. ""It is wonderful that today on K2 10 Nepalis have made history and shown our bravery and strength,"" added Mr Rita, who has climbed Everest a record 24 times. As news of their success broke, it was also confirmed that another climber, Spaniard Sergi Mingote, died after experiencing a severe fall. Mr Mingote, 49, was based with another team and had been descending to K2's base camp when he slipped and fell. An experienced mountaineer, Mr Mingote had previously climbed seven of the world's so-called ""8000ers"", including Everest. He had been attempting to summit K2 without oxygen but became severely fatigued, forcing him to abandon the expedition.

Nasa's 'megarocket' set to fire up engines,"This video can not be played The four main engines were fired in unison for the first time, but had to be shut down early A critical engine test for Nasa's new ""megarocket"" has ended early, but the agency denied it amounted to a failure. Shortly before 22:30 GMT (17:30 EST) on Saturday, the four engines ignited, burning for more than a minute before the event was aborted. The core stage of the Space Launch System (SLS) was being evaluated at Stennis Space Center, in Mississippi. The engines were supposed to fire for eight minutes to simulate the rocket's climb to orbit. The SLS is part of Nasa's Artemis programme, which aims to put Americans back on the lunar surface in the 2020s. When it makes its maiden flight - possibly later this year - the SLS will become the most powerful rocket ever to have flown to space. Teams at Stennis are still poring over the data to find out what happened. John Honeycutt, SLS program manager at Nasa's Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama, said there were ""a lot of dynamics going on"" when the engine shut down. Nasa's giant SLS rocket: a guide Nasa's new 'megarocket' set for critical tests Artemis: To the Moon and beyond The engines' power levels were being throttled down and up again; they were also being prepared to pivot - or gimbal. This movement allows the rocket to be steered during flight. The RS-25 engines are the same type that powered the space shuttle orbiter ""We did see a little bit of a flash come from around the interface between the thermal protection blanket on engine four at the time when we had initiated the gimbal,"" Honeycutt told reporters at a post-test briefing at Stennis. The as-yet unknown problem triggered what Nasa calls a failure identification (Fid), followed by a major component failure (MCF). As a result of the fault, an onboard computer known as the engine controller sent a message to another computer called the core stage controller, which took a decision to shut down the vehicle. ""Any parameter that went awry on the engine could have sent that failure ID,"" said John Honeycutt. It was the first time all four RS-25 engines had been ignited together, in a test known as a ""hotfire"". The core stage of the rocket was anchored to a massive steel structure called the B-2 test stand on the grounds of the Stennis facility. To prepare the core stage, engineers filled its tanks with more than 700,000 gallons (2.6 million litres) of super-cold liquid hydrogen and oxygen propellant. This was the eighth and final test in the Green Run, a programme of evaluation carried out by engineers from Nasa and Boeing - the rocket's prime contractor. Although the test was intended to run for eight minutes, engineers would have received all the data required to certify the rocket for flight after 250 seconds. They wanted to iron out any problems before the core stage is used for the first SLS launch, in which it will send Nasa's next-generation Orion spacecraft on a loop around the Moon. Nasa's outgoing administrator Jim Bridenstine declined to call Saturday's event a failure: ""This is why we test,"" he said, adding: ""Before we put American astronauts on American rockets, that's when we need it to be perfect."" Officials have not yet decided whether to re-run the hotfire, or proceed with shipping the core stage to Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida to prepare it for the rocket's uncrewed maiden flight, a mission called Artemis-1. ""It depends what the anomaly was and how challenging it's going to be to fix it,"" said Bridenstine. Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine said perfection wasn't a realistic expectation for the first engine test Asked whether a launch this year was still feasible, he added: ""I think it's too early to tell. As we figure out what went wrong, we're going to know what the future holds."" However, if one or more of the engines needs to be replaced, there are spares waiting to be used at Stennis Space Center. The Artemis-1 mission will evaluate how both the SLS and Orion capsule perform prior to Nasa staging a repeat of this lunar loop with astronauts in 2023. This will be followed by the first landing on the Moon by humans since the Apollo 17 mission in 1972. The SLS consists of the 65m (212 ft) -long core stage with two smaller solid rocket boosters (SRBs) attached to the sides. Engineers at KSC have begun stacking the individual SRB segments for Artemis-1. ""This powerful rocket is going to put us in a position to be ready to support the agency and the country in deep space missions to the Moon and beyond,"" John Honeycutt said during a media briefing on Tuesday. Artwork: The initial version of the SLS - known as Block 1 - during the climb to orbit Officials have been planning to ship the core stage to Florida in February. Its engines are of the same type that powered the spaceplane-like shuttle orbiter - America's crewed space vehicle for 30 years from 1981-2011. Nasa is re-using flown hardware: the RS-25 engines used in this test helped launch 21 shuttle missions. Two were used on the last shuttle flight - STS-135 in 2011. The four RS-25s can generate 1.6 million lbs (7 Meganewtons) of thrust - the force that propels a rocket through the air. When the solid rocket boosters are added to the core stage, the combined system will produce 8.8 million pounds (39.1 Meganewtons) of thrust. This will make it 15% more powerful than the giant Saturn V rocket that sent astronauts to the Moon in the 1960s and 70s. Prior to Saturday's test, John Shannon, vice president and SLS program manager at Boeing praised teams at Stennis for keeping the Green Run on track despite the pandemic and this year's particularly active hurricane season.

'Urgent' aviation support plea over travel curbs,"The UK's aviation sector ""urgently"" needs more government support if it is to survive another long period of travel curbs, industry groups say. From Monday, arrivals to the UK from all destinations will be required to quarantine in an effort to prevent the spread of any new variants of Covid. People will also have to show proof of a negative test taken in the previous 72 hours before travelling. The government said it was committed to supporting the travel industry. Underthe new rules beginning at 04:00 GMT on Monday,external, all travel corridors - which have been in place to allow arrivals from some countries to forgo quarantine - are being closed. All arrivals to the UK after that time will need to isolate for up to 10 days, although the quarantine period can be cut short with a negative test after five days. What are the new rules for travellers? Why hasn't the UK banned all international flights? UK to close all travel corridors from Monday With all parts of the UK under lockdown amid high levels of infection, only essential travel is permitted. There were 55,761 new confirmed cases recorded on Friday and 1,280 more people were reported to have died within 28 days of a positive test. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the changes at a Downing Street news conference on Friday, saying they would ""protect against the risk of as yet unidentified new strains"" of Covid. The new rules will be in place until at least 15 February, he said. The travel industry said closing the travel corridors was understandable due to the health emergency, but warned it would deepen the crisis for the sector. The Airport Operators Association said that there was ""only so long"" before airports might have to close temporarily to save costs and called for more support. Geoff Turner is currently teaching accounting and finance at the American University of Bahrain Geoff Turner is booked on a flight back to the UK with his wife on 2 February, two days after his contract working as a university professor in Bahrain comes to an end. After living in Australia for 40 years and travelling the world for 15 years, Geoff says he has nowhere to call home in the UK and needs to quickly find somewhere they can tell the authorities they will isolate under the government's new travel rules. He said: ""Nothing can be done now to change our flights. We'll have to quarantine for 10 days, meaning no work and no income. ""Is the government going to provide support during that time? I doubt it very much. ""It's the suddenness of it all. You find out that what you knew isn't what's happening anymore and it gets to a point where it's so late in the day you can't do anything about it."" Aban on travellers from South America, Portugal and Cape Verdealso came into force on Friday, having been imposed over concerns about a new variant identified in Brazil. New variants causing concern have previously been identifiedin the UKandSouth Africa, with many countries imposing restrictions on arrivals from both nations. Scientists fear the variants seen in South Africa and Brazil mayinterfere with the effectiveness of vaccines and evade parts of the immune system. Prof John Edmunds from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, said the South Africa variant had already been detected in the UK and it was ""quite likely"" that the Brazilian one had been imported too. But he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the ""severe restrictions"" the UK is under would help to contain any cases of the new variants and make it harder for them to spread. Prof Edmunds warned relaxing restrictions at the end of February with only the most vulnerable having been given a first dose of the vaccine would be a ""disaster"". ""If we relaxed our restrictions we would immediately put the NHS under enormous pressure again,"" he said. Travel corridors were introduced in the summer to allow people to travel to and from some countries with low numbers of Covid cases without having to quarantine on their return. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, said the system had been ""a lifeline for the industry"" last summer but ""things change and there's no doubting this is a serious health emergency"". He said he assumed the government would remove the latest restrictions as soon as it was safe. ""We've had no revenue now effectively for 12 months, give or take a few months in the summer last year. If we're going to have an aviation sector coming out of this we need to open up in the summer,"" he told the BBC. Abta, a trade association of travel agents and tour operators, said the government should provide support ""as a matter of urgency"" both for the jobs and businesses at risk, and ""in recognition of the important role the travel industry will play in the UK's economic recovery"". How worrying are the new Covid variants? Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said closing the travel corridors was the ""right step"" but called the timing of the decision ""slow again"", adding that the public would be thinking ""why on earth didn't this happen before"". Labour also criticised the effectiveness of the quarantine system, with shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds saying ""it's been a real problem"". Only about 3% of people were contacted to ensure they were quarantining, he said. But aviation minister Robert Courts told the Today programme there was a ""robust enforcement process"", with three million spot checks of the passenger locator forms which travellers are required to fill in on arrival. A Department for Transport spokesman said it was supporting the travel industry with an extension to the furlough scheme until the end of April, business rates relief and tax deferrals. Travel operators had already been forced to cancel holidays before the latest restrictions were announced. Earlier this week, Jet2 suspended all flights and holidays until 25 March over ""ongoing uncertainty"" and budget travel provider EasyJet on Thursday began cancelling holidays up to and including 24 March.

"Further 1,295 Covid deaths recorded in the UKAnother 4,262 people have also been admitted to hospital with the virus, the government says.UK","A further 1,295 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test have been reported in the UK, the third-highest daily total since the pandemic began. It brings the total number of deaths by this measure to 88,590. There have also been a further 41,346 lab-confirmed cases, and 4,262 more people have been admitted to hospital. Dr Yvonne Doyle, medical director for Public Health England, said the ""continuous rise in cases and deaths should be a bitter warning for us all"". ""We must not forget the basics,"" she added. ""The lives of our friends and family depend on it. ""Keep your distance from others, wash your hands and wear a mask."" The latest figures come ahead of Monday'schange in travel rules for the UK, with all travel corridors closing, meaning arrivals from every country will have to quarantine. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the changes at Downing Street on Friday, saying they would ""protect against the risk of as yet unidentified new strains"" of Covid. Protect us from unlawful killing charges - medics 'Urgent' aviation support plea over travel curbs 'I caught Covid - and my father-in-law died' While daily figures can fluctuate due to delays in reporting, the seven-day average of Covid deaths in the UK has now risen slightly to 1,103. For cases, however, there has been a drop in the seven-day average, with the figure now at 48,565. There are currently 37,475 people in hospital with the virus, government figures show, while a further 324,233 people have received their first vaccine dose. The government has promised all the over-70s, the extremely clinically vulnerable and front-line health and care workers - about 15 million people - will be offered a jab by mid February. Currently, just over 3.5 million doses have been administered. The government has also announced Â£120m in funds for the social care sector to be used by local authorities to increase staffing levels. Staff absence rates have risen in care homes and among home care staff, due to them testing positive or having to self-isolate. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said the money would bolster staffing numbers in a ""controlled and safe way, whilst ensuring people continue to receive the highest quality of care"". A further Â£149m funding was announced in December to support rapid testing of care home staff. Speaking alongside the PM on Friday, England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, said the number of patients being admitted to hospital with coronavirus was set to peak within the next 10 days, while the peak for deaths was also yet to come. He added, however, that he hoped the peak in infections had already happened in the South East, East and London, where there was a surge in the new, more transmissible variant. ""The peak of deaths I fear is in the future, the peak of hospitalisations in some parts of the country may be around about now and beginning to come off the very, very top,"" he said. ""Because people are sticking so well to the guidelines we do think the peaks are coming over the next week to 10 days for most places in terms of new people into hospital."" However, chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance stressed it was a ""suppressed peak"" that would ""boil over for sure"" if controls were eased. He said: ""This is not the natural peak that's going to come down on its own, it's coming down because of the measures that are in place. ""Take the lid off now and it's going to boil over for sure and we're going to end up with a big problem."" Meanwhile, on Saturday, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer suggested he would back further coronavirus measures, as ""the tougher the restrictions now the quicker we get the virus back under control"". Sir Keir said he was ""still worried"" by the number of infections, despite signs they are falling - and that the ""sense that we are through the worst"" of the third wave was wrong. ""Nobody likes restrictions but the tougher the restrictions now the quicker we get the virus back under control, the quicker we reduce the number of hospital admissions and the quicker we get that number of deaths, tragically, down,"" he added.

Centrist elected leader of Merkel's CDU party,"Mr Laschet is now in a good position to stand for German chancellor Centrist Armin Laschet has been elected leader of Germany's Christian Democrats (CDU), the party of Chancellor Angela Merkel. Mr Laschet, premier of North Rhine-Westphalia state, defeated two rivals in the party's virtual conference. He is now in a good position in the race to succeed Mrs Merkel when she steps down as German chancellor in September, after 16 years in office. But he faces a changed political landscape following the Covid pandemic. Mr Laschet, 59, defeated conservative businessman Friedrich Merz in a run-off vote by 521 votes to 466. A third candidate, Norbert RÃ¶ttgen, was eliminated in the previous round. The men vying to take Merkel's top job in Germany He replaces as chair of the party Annegret Kramp-Karrenbauer, who failed to live up to her billing as Mrs Merkel's appointed successor after taking office more than two years ago. Germany goes to the polls in September, but the CDU leader is not guaranteed to become its candidate for chancellor. Health Minister Jens Spahn, who has been elected as one of Mr Laschet's deputies, and Markus SÃ¶der, leader of the CDU's Bavarian sister party the CSU, could also step into the ring, though neither has yet said that they want the job. A final decision will be made in the spring. Mr Laschet is a loyal supporter of Mrs Merkel, and said during the campaign that a change of direction for the party would ""send exactly the wrong signal"". In his victory speech, he said: ""I want to do everything so that we can stick together through this year... and then make sure that the next chancellor in the federal elections will be from the [CDU/CSU] union."" Armin Laschet is a short, cheerful chap. The popular premier of Germany's most populous state, North Rhine-Westphalia, he throws himself with gusto into traditional carnival celebrations. He touts himself as a continuity candidate and, for a time at least, was thought to have been Angela Merkel's preferred candidate. He defended her stance during the 2015 refugee crisis and is known for his liberal politics, passion for the EU and ability to connect with immigrant communities. But his call for an early relaxation of Covid restrictions last spring surprised many and reportedly infuriated Mrs Merkel. He has since retreated from that position but he's had to work to repair the damage to his political credibility. The big question now is whether the CDU will put him up as their chancellor candidate in September's general election. German Health Minister Jens Spahn - who supported Mr Laschet in his leadership bid - is thought to harbour ambitions to the chancellory. And recent opinion polls suggest that Bavarian Prime Minister Markus SÃ¶der would be a popular choice too. Who wants to follow in Merkel's footsteps?

Rain moves in after wintry start for parts of UK,"Parts of the UK were blanketed in snow on Saturday as forecasters warned of the potential for disruption. East Anglia woke up to a thick layer that had settled overnight and there were warnings that rural communities could be ""cut off"", with up to 8cm (3in) of snow forecast. People in eastern England were warned to expect power cuts and travel delays. However, by midday snow had stopped falling across most parts of the UK, replaced by rain and sleet in places. Some further light snow is still expected in the hills and mountains of Scotland. Parts of Wales and Northern Ireland were mostly cloudy, with some bands of rain in the northern regions. In pictures: Winter scenes from around the UK Parts of East of England wake to snowy cold snap The Met Office had predicted between 4-8cm (1.5-3in) of snow could fall in the worst-affected regions, and warned drivers to accelerate their cars ""gently"" and leave a large gap between surrounding vehicles. But the worst of the wintry weather has passed and earlieramber and yellow weather warnings,externalhave been cancelled. Blackmoss Reservoir covered in snow in Barley, Pendle, Lancashire A man trekking through the snow at a golf course in Gleneagles Two women sledging in Gleneagles Greg Dewhurst, a Met Office forecaster, said earlier that Saturday was expected to be the colder of the two days over the weekend. He said: ""Temperatures are unlikely to rise above 10C, with a lot of areas closer to freezing."" There were also 25 flood warnings across England on Saturday Luke Miall, meteorologist at the Met Office, said earlier patches of snow could reach parts of Greater London. He said the snow had the potential to cause some ""fairly significant disruption"". There were also 22 flood warnings across England on Saturday, stretching from the South East to the North East, meaning ""immediate action is required"", according to the Environment Agency. This is expected to clear up in the evening, going into Sunday, when southern and eastern parts of the UK will see dry, sunny spells. North-western regions are expected to see showers, with a ""spell of more persistent rain"" later on in the day.

"Northern Ireland records highest weekly Covid deathsStatistics agency Nisra says 145 deaths were registered last week, bringing its pandemic total to 1,976.Northern Ireland'I caught Covid - and my father-in-law died'","Northern Ireland's statistics agency has recorded its highest weekly Covid-19 related registered deaths since the pandemic began. Nisra said 145 deaths were registered in the first week of 2021, although administrative delays over Christmas may have affected the number. That brings the agency's death toll to 1,976 by 8 January. The figures come as the chief medical officers from NI and the Republic issued a joint stay-at-home plea. Dr Michael McBride and Dr Tony Holohan said they were ""gravely concerned"" about the ""unsustainably high level of Covid-19 infection"" across the island of Ireland. Concern was raised in the Republic of Ireland this week as figures showedit has the world's highest number of confirmed new Covid-19 cases per million people. On Friday evening, the Irish Department of Health reported 50 further deaths with Covid-19 and 3,498 new cases of the virus. More than half (54%) of those newly diagnosed are under the age of 45. Northern Ireland is in the third week of a six-week lockdown, with ministers scheduled to review measures next week. Visiting suspended in NI hospitals due to Covid Minister tells big retail to stop non-essential trade NI to introduce international travel Covid tests However, health officials have warned that an extension of the restrictions could be required to reduce pressure on the health service. Of the 2,019 deaths recorded by Nisra by 8 January, 1,247 (62%) occurred in hospital, 622 (31%) in care homes, 12 (0.6%) in hospices and 138 (7%) at residential addresses or other locations. People aged 75 and over account for just over three-quarters of all Covid-19 related registered deaths (77.6%) between 19 March 2020 and 8 January 2021. Just over a fifth (22.2%) of all Covid-19 related registered deaths have been of people with an address in the Belfast council area. Meanwhile, the Department of Health reported 26 further Covid-related deaths on Friday. Five of these deaths did not occur in the past 24 hours. The Department of Health bases its figures on a positive test result being recorded, whereas Nisra figures are based on mentions of the virus on death certificates, so people may or may not have been confirmed to have contracted the virus prior to death. A further 1,052 individuals have tested positive for Covid-19 and 63 patients are being treated in intensive care units, 47 of whom are on ventilators. The chief medical officers warned the high infection rate was having a ""significant impact"" on the health of the population and the ""safe functioning"" of the healthcare systems. They said the public should avoid all unnecessary journeys, including cross-border travel. Pointing out that many of the patients admitted to hospital in January have been younger than 65, they warned coronavirus could affect anyone, ""regardless of age or underlying condition"". ""It highlights the need for us all to protect one another by staying at home,"" said the medical officers. Northern Ireland's spike in infections has been put down to an easing of restrictions over Christmas. Asked if he regretted being part of the decision to ease restrictions, Health Minister Robin Swann said the executive had tried to be balanced in its approach. ""I regret the pressures we see now in our hospitals, but let's remember it's caused by this virus, we have it in our power to bring it back under control and get us back to where we were in the summer,"" he told BBC News NI on Friday. Mr Swann pleaded with people to follow the current restrictions. ""We're in the middle of a very tough six-week scenario, and how we come out of this will be a more graduated approach to make sure we get the benefits of what we've already done, and also the benefits of the vaccine.""

GPs warned about delay to batch of Covid vaccinesOne health board says it has contacted doctors to suggest delaying vaccination appointments.Wales,"This video can not be played How will I get my Covid-19 vaccine in Wales? GPs in north Wales are being advised to consider delaying Covid-19 vaccine appointments early next week due to a hold-up affecting about 26,000 doses. Betsi Cadwaladr health board, which manages healthcare in the area, said it was a national issue which was expected to be ""resolved in the coming days"". The Welsh Government said one Oxford-AstraZeneca batch out of four had been delayed. It had been due to be shared between Wales' seven health boards. It said rollout plans were unaffected. The Welsh Government said it had been assured it would get more Pfizer vaccines by February, despite shipments of it beingtemporarily slowedbecause of changes to the company's manufacturing processes. Four per cent of the Welsh population have received a vaccine so far. Chris Stockport, executive director primary and community care at Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, said the organisation was ""notified of a delay in releasing a batch of vaccines which would have disrupted supply nationally in the middle of next week"".

GPs warned about delay to batch of Covid vaccinesOne health board says it has contacted doctors to suggest delaying vaccination appointments.Wales'I caught Covid - and my father-in-law died',"This video can not be played How will I get my Covid-19 vaccine in Wales? GPs in north Wales are being advised to consider delaying Covid-19 vaccine appointments early next week due to a hold-up affecting about 26,000 doses. Betsi Cadwaladr health board, which manages healthcare in the area, said it was a national issue which was expected to be ""resolved in the coming days"". The Welsh Government said one Oxford-AstraZeneca batch out of four had been delayed. It had been due to be shared between Wales' seven health boards. It said rollout plans were unaffected. The Welsh Government said it had been assured it would get more Pfizer vaccines by February, despite shipments of it beingtemporarily slowedbecause of changes to the company's manufacturing processes. Four per cent of the Welsh population have received a vaccine so far. Chris Stockport, executive director primary and community care at Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, said the organisation was ""notified of a delay in releasing a batch of vaccines which would have disrupted supply nationally in the middle of next week"".

Final execution of Trump presidency is carried out,"A court had previously ordered a stay of execution for Higgs over a Covid-19 diagnosis Dustin Higgs, an inmate on death row in Indiana, has died in the final federal execution of the Trump presidency just days before he leaves office. Higgs was convicted in the killings of three women in a wildlife refuge in 1996, but until his death denied ordering their murder. He died by lethal injection at 01:23 local time (06:23 GMT) on Saturday. His execution is the 13th carried out since July when the US government ended a 17-year hiatus on federal executions. It comes just days before President-elect Joe Biden, who is against the death penalty, is sworn in. In Trump's final days, a rush of executions Looking for answers in the life of a killer How many countries still have the death sentence? There has been criticism of the Trump administration's rush to carry out the sentences - breaking with an 130-year-old precedent of pausing executions during a presidential transition. Higgs was convicted and sentenced to death in 2001 for overseeing the 1996 kidnapping and murder of three women: Tanji Jackson, Tamika Black and Mishann Chinn. The women had been on a date with Higgs and two other men at an apartment before one rebuffed his advances and an argument broke out between the group. Higgs and accomplice Willis Haynes offered to drive them home but instead took them to a wildlife refuge in Maryland, where prosecutors said Higgs gave Haynes a gun and told him to shoot the three women. Haynes, who confessed to being the shooter, was sentenced to life in prison in a separate trial. ""It is arbitrary and inequitable to punish Mr Higgs more severely than the actual killer,"" a lawyer had appealed in a plea for clemency addressed to President Trump. Alexa Cave, sister of Dustin Higgs, was there for his execution A court had ordered a stay of execution for Higgs and another inmate, Corey Johnson, on Tuesday after they contracted Covid-19 on death row - with lawyers arguing damage to their lung tissue would cause painful suffering during their executions. But the Department of Justice immediately appealed and won the case. Johnson was put to death on Thursday. A final bid to halt Higgs's execution then failed on Friday when the US Supreme Court's conservative majority voted 6-3 to clear the way the sentence to be carried out. ""This is not justice,"" Justice Sonia Sotomayor wrote in her dissent. ""After waiting almost two decades to resume federal executions, the Government should have proceeded with some measure of restraint to ensure it did so lawfully. When it did not, this Court should have. It has not."" She also listed the names of all 13 executed since July: ""To put that in historical context, the Federal Government will have executed more than three times as many people in the last six months that it had in the previous six decades."" In his final words, Higgs repeated his claim to innocence. ""I'd like to say I am an innocent man,"" he said, mentioning the three women by name. ""I did not order the murders."" Higgs was the third to die at a federal prison in Terre Haute, Indiana this week includingLisa Montgomery, the only woman on federal death rowon Wednesday. ""The government completed its unprecedented slaughter of 13 human beings tonight by killing Dustin Higgs, a Black man who never killed anyone, on Martin Luther King's birthday,"" Shawn Nolan, one of Higgs's lawyers, said in a statement. ""Dustin spent decades on death row in solitary confinement helping others around him, while working tirelessly to fight his unjust convictions.""

How serious are the new variants?,"Two new fast-spreading subvariants of Omicron are causing fresh surges of Covid around the world. BA.4 and BA.5 were first identified in South Africa and may soon become the dominant strains in Europe and the US, health experts say. Ever since it first emerged, Covid has been mutating or shape-shifting. The new genetic versions that keep appearing are called variants. There have been a few major variants already, such as alpha and delta, that have caused massive waves of infection. The latest ones experts are concerned about - BA.4 and BA.5 - are very closely related to the Omicron variant behind last winter's wave. They were added to the World Health Organization's monitoring list in March and have also been designated as variants of concern in Europe. They were spotted circulating in South Africa at the beginning of the year and now appear to be spreading much more quickly than other variants. Most European countries now have them and they look set to overtake other types of Covid soon. That's already happened in Portugal - BA.5 is now dominant there. In the US, officials say they are seeing rising numbers of infections caused by the two new subvariants. Covid infections in the UK are also increasing, driven by BA.4 and BA.5. Australia has reported cases too. Experts are unsure how hard countries will be hit. BA.4 and BA.5 Omicron are not thought to be any more lethal than other types of Covid. Lots of people have built up some immunity from past infections and vaccination, which is helping to make the disease less risky overall. But the new subvariants do appear to be spreading more easily. This is partly because immunity may be waning, but also because of the mutations the virus has undergone. Many countries have also lifted their Covid restrictions, meaning people are mixing more, which gives the virus more chances to spread. BA.4 and BA.5 appear to be able to infect people even if they've recently had other types of Omicron. A wave of new infections could lead to more hospitalisations and some more deaths. As with other Covid variants, the risk or serious illness remains highest for people who are elderly, or who have significant underlying health conditions. Although current vaccines are not a perfect fit, they are still the best line of defence. They have cut the risk of severe illness against the other major Covid variants, including Delta, Alpha, Beta and Gamma. Doctors say it is vital people get the recommended number of doses to gain maximum protection against existing and emerging variants. Extra Covid booster in spring for over-75s and high risk How many people have been vaccinated so far? Updated versions of vaccines against Covid variants are already being designed and tested. Manufacturers could scale up production quickly too, and regulators have already discussed how to fast-track the approval process. Viruses make carbon copies of themselves to reproduce, but they aren't perfect at it. Errors creep in that change the genetic blueprint, resulting in a new version of the virus. If this gives the virus a survival advantage, the new version will thrive. The more chances coronavirus has to make copies of itself in us - the host - the more opportunities there are for mutations to occur. How many people have had boosters so far?

Protect us from unlawful killing charges - medics,"Doctors and nurses need protection from prosecution over Covid-19 treatment decisions made under the pressures of the pandemic, medical bodies have said. Groups including the British Medical Association have written to ministers saying medical workers fear they could be at risk of unlawful killing charges. It comes as the UK's chief medical officers said the NHS could be overwhelmed in weeks. The government said staff should not have to fear legal action. The letter from the health organisations points out that the prime minister warned in November that the NHS being overwhelmed would be a ""medical and moral disaster"", where ""doctors and nurses could be forced to choose which patients to treat, who would live and who would die"". It said: ""With the chief medical officers now determining that there is a material risk of the NHS being overwhelmed within weeks, our members are worried that not only do they face being put in this position but also that they could subsequently be vulnerable to a criminal investigation by the police."" Co-ordinated by the Medical Protection Society (MPS), the letter was signed by the British Medical Association, the Doctors' Association UK, the Hospital Consultants and Specialists Association, the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin and Medical Defence Shield. Key NHS services 'in crisis' after Covid surge Packed Covid hospitals raised death risk by 20% Government sued over care home deaths 'disgrace' It calls for emergency legislation to protect doctors and nurses from ""inappropriate"" legal action when dealing with circumstances outside their control. Existing guidance for doctors and nurses on when to administer or withdraw treatment does not give legal protection, the letter says. It also says the guidance does not consider the circumstances of the pandemic where demand for healthcare may outstrip supply. ""The first concern of a doctor is their patients and providing the highest standard of care at all times,"" the medical bodies said. ""We do not believe it is right that healthcare professionals should suffer from the moral injury and long-term psychological damage that could result from having to make decisions on how limited resources are allocated, while at the same time being left vulnerable to the risk of prosecution for unlawful killing."" This video can not be played What does it mean if the NHS is overwhelmed? The medical organisations said no healthcare professional should be ""above the law"" and that the emergency legislation should only apply to decisions made ""in good faith"" and ""in circumstances beyond their control and in compliance with relevant guidance"". They said the change in the law should be temporary and should apply retrospectively from the start of the pandemic. Medical staff in the NHS are protected financially from clinical negligence claims by indemnity schemes where the state pays the costs of claims. But if someone dies as a result of a lack of treatment, doctors and nurses fear prosecutors could bring charges such as gross negligence manslaughter, which can carry a maximum sentence of life imprisonment. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCKDOWN LOOK-UP:The rules in your area TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? Earlier this month, a survey by the MPS of 2,420 of its members found that 61% were concerned about facing an investigation following a decision made in a high-pressure situation. About 36% were concerned about being investigated for a decision to withdraw or withhold life-prolonging treatment due to pressure on resources during the pandemic. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""Dedicated frontline NHS staff should be able to focus on treating patients and saving lives during the pandemic without fear of legal action."" NHS staff have been told that existing indemnity arrangements will continue and will cover ""the vast majority of liabilities"", the spokesman said.

What are the new travel rules?,"Fully vaccinated people travelling to the UK no longer have to take any Covid tests - either before departure or on arrival. The prime minister has announced thathe intends to remove England's remaining Covid restrictions at the end of the month. Fully vaccinated travellers (two doses) and under-18s no longer need to take a test either before or after they arrive in England, Scotland, Wales or Northern Ireland. To qualify as vaccinated, non-UK travellers must have received their jabs in a country or territory with""approved proof of vaccination"".,externalThis now covers most countries in the world, with more - including China - due to join on 11 February. Will travel return to normal this summer? What Covid rules remain across the UK? Unvaccinated travellers still have to show proof of a negative Covid test taken two days before departure. They must also take a post-arrival PCR test two days after arrival. This must be booked before travelling to the UK and bought privately froma government-approved list of providers.,external If this is positive, they need toself-isolate. However, unvaccinated travellers no longer have to self-isolate on arrival, or take a test on day eight. All unvaccinated travellers to the UK must complete apassenger locator form,externalbefore departure. Digital Covid passes showing your vaccination status can be downloaded to your phone, whether you're inEngland,external,Scotland,external,Wales,externalorNorthern Ireland,external. Test results can be in the form of a printed document, or an email or text on your phone. They must be in English, French or Spanish. European Union residents can use theEU Digital Covid Certificateto show their vaccination status or test results. Since 3 February, 12 to 15-year-olds in England have also been able to prove their vaccination status via the digital NHS pass. Where do I need to use a Covid passport? You are responsible forchecking the entry requirements for any other countries you wish to visit,,externalas well as the local Covid restrictions which are in force. These can change quickly. Many UK familieshave cancelled half-term trips to mainland Spain and the Canary Islandsbecause children over 12 must be double vaccinated to enter. Very few countries allow unrestricted access to those who have not been vaccinated. It is thought more than 80 holiday destinations around the world still require all UK travellers to take a pre-departure PCR test before arrival. UK-issuedCovid passes can be used throughout the EU to show proof of vaccination- either digitally, or as a printed download (as long as it is dated after than 1 November 2021).

Why hasn't the UK banned flights?,"There are more than 40 countries onthe government's red list,external, which has the strictest travel restrictions. One is India, where a new mutation of coronavirus first identified in the country has spread to the UK. This has been linked to international travel. It has been classified as a""variant of concern"",externaland more than 3,400 cases of it have been found in the UK. But despite this and the discovery in the UK of other variants identified abroad, the government has never banned international travel altogether - unlike some countries. A traffic light system has been introduced for travel, with countries classed as green, amber or red - with different rules for quarantine and Covid tests. What are the travel rules? Matt Hancock's India Covid claim fact-checked Red list countries (which include India, Pakistan, Brazil and South Africa) are those the UK government says are at the highest risk from Covid, and should not be visited ""except in the most extreme of circumstances"". If you have been in one, you can only enter the UK if you are a UK or Irish national, or UK resident. You must be tested negative for Covid-19 before departure and self-isolate for 10 days in a government-approved quarantine hotel. Direct flights from many red list countries to the UK are banned but some are allowed. These include flights from India, Pakistan, Bangladesh and Kenya. The government says this is to avoid potential disruption to critical freight and British nationals seeking to return home. On one day (19 May), Reality Check counted 4 direct flights from India to Heathrow. Coronavirus variants originally found in Brazil, South Africa and India are believed to be more transmissible, and there are concerns vaccines may not be quite as effective against them. British and Irish citizens who have been in these countries are allowed to return to the UK and - until mid-February - were trusted to self-isolate at home and could take public transport to get there. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the UK had moved ""as fast as we could"" to introduce quarantine hotels, describing them as a ""very tough regime"". The measures began on 15 February 2021, after weeks of speculation. Labour said there had been a lack of a ""comprehensive"" border system. How worrying are the new coronavirus variants? What is the government doing about the South Africa strain? The Civil Aviation Authority said that in February 2021, 50,000 passengers travelled between India and the UK, which is an average of just under 900 a day in each direction. The country was placed on the red list on 23 April and there has been criticism that it should have been added earlier. Why was India not on the red list sooner? Matt Hancock's India Covid claim fact-checked Just under half of people with the India variant of concern in England had been travelling,according to a 13 May briefing from Public Health England,external. It said that about one third of the cases were in London and a quarter were in the North West of England. Positive tests from passengers arriving in the UK are automatically sent for genome sequencing, which identifies new variants. But there is concern that by the time a variant has been identified, it may already have spread in the UK. The debate over whether to shut UK borders stretches back to the start of the pandemic. Between January and March 2020, the UK introduced some measures to try to protect itself from the new virus. Quarantine was imposed on 273 people travelling from Wuhan in China, where the first outbreak was seen. Others from ""high-risk countries"" including China, Iran and Northern Italy were asked to voluntarily isolate for 14 days. Aninquiry into the pandemic,externalsuggested it was understandable the government ""did not consider it practical or effective simply to restrict flights"" at that time, partly because there were so many British residents trying to get home. But these self-isolation requirements were withdrawn on 13 March 2020 - 10 days before the UK went into the first lockdown. ""The government's failure to have proper quarantine measures in place in March as the infection was spreading fast was a grave error and meant Covid spread faster and reached more people,"" Yvette Cooper, chair of the committee of MPs behind the inquiry said. One study found,externalthe virus was introduced to the UK ""well over a thousand times in early 2020"", with a third of transmission chains brought in from Spain, followed by 29% from France, neither of which faced any restrictions. China accounted for just 0.4% of imported cases. At the end of February 2020, the World Health Organization (WHO)advised against travel bans,external, saying they were ""usually not effective in preventing the importation of cases but may have a significant economic and social impact"". In April 2021, the WHO said it wouldupdate its ""risk-based guidance"",externalon Covid and international travel. The Home Office said the committee behind the inquiry was ""incorrect in their assertions"". It said keeping borders open helped businesses maintain international connections, boosted the economy and meant people could still travel for essential reasons. It argued that by mid-March 2020 there was ""significant transmission"" in the UK and any extra travel restrictions at that time would have had a ""very marginal"" impact. At ameeting in February 2020,external, the government advisory committee Sage suggested that cutting the number of infections entering the UK by half would only delay the epidemic by five days. The scientists estimated that a 95% reduction in imported cases, which would have required ""draconian"" travel restrictions, would have pushed things back by a month. But at itsmeeting in January 2021,external, Sage said: ""No intervention, other than a complete, pre-emptive closure of borders, or the mandatory quarantine of all visitors upon arrival in designated facilities, irrespective of testing history, can get close to fully preventing the importation of cases or new variants.""

How a pilot ended up producing PPE,"Douglas Jones was fulfilling a lifelong dream when he became a pilot The aviation industry has been among those hardest hit by the Covid pandemic. Pilot Douglas Jones was working for Aegean Airlines, flying out of Athens, when it began. It cost him his job and also prompted him to return to the small Scottish town where he grew up. Now he is now turning his hand to a very different line of work producing PPE, in a sector which is enjoying something of a boom. Mr Jones saw much of Europe in his work with Easyjet and Aegean Airlines The 27-year-old, who was born in Haywards Heath in Sussex but raised in Moffat in Dumfries and Galloway, was enjoying his dream job at the start of 2020. Having gained a commercial pilot's licence, he was based in Berlin with Easyjet before landing a position in Greece. ""It is definitely what I have always wanted to do,"" he said. ""With Aegean I have flown a good way across all the major airports of Europe."" However, life changed ""very quickly"" as coronavirus spread across the continent. ""I flew to Copenhagen and I flew back from Copenhagen and I was on unpaid leave when I landed back in Athens,"" he explained. Fearing being stranded in Greece, he booked a flight home to Scotland and within a couple of weeks he received confirmation that his job was gone. Mr Jones returned to Moffat amid fears of being stranded in Greece Mr Jones said it took some time for him to fully appreciate that he would not be returning to the skies any time soon. ""Half of my stuff is still in Greece because we came back to our home countries thinking this will only be three to six months and that will be that,"" he said. ""We had just no concept of how bad this was ever going to be."" It meant he was back home in a region where he admits there are ""not a huge amount of options career-wise in normal times"". ""When you have been used to living in Berlin and Athens and you move back to Moffat, living with your dad, it is a bit of slowdown,"" he said. ""I was just desperate to do something, to have work."" Alpha Solway is producing millions of masks for NHS Scotland It was a relative of a friend who spotted south of Scotland firm Alpha Solway was hiring new workers tomeet demand for personal protective equipment (PPE). After interview, he was offered a job in June which proved to be something of a change of pace from day one. ""I came in and I sat and cut elastic for visors for most of the day - I think I cut like something like 3km worth of elastic because one of the machines had a fault,"" he said. Since then he has helped make filter units for masks, developed standard work procedures and become a ""jack of all trades"" for the business. Mr Jones said of his abilities as a pilot were useful at the PPE factory He said he had been ""surprised"" by what parts of his old job he could bring to his new post. ""A lot in commercial aviation is about awareness - situational awareness - and a lot of that can be built into manufacturing as well,"" he said. ""When you are talking health and safety around large automated machinery you have to be aware of what things are doing and when and who is doing what. ""As a pilot - as you might like to think - we have quite a logical way of looking at things. The way we are trained to look at problems is very applicable to manufacturing."" An ""incredible"" summer helped ease the transition from Greece to Moffat So how has the transition back to rural Scotland gone? ""We are so lucky that the summer we had here was quite incredible,"" said Mr Jones. ""To be out in Moffat, even during lockdown, you can access the hills, you don't have to drive outside a five-mile radius. ""You can just go out and walk and you will never see a soul."" Some things, however, take more getting used to, like his more conventional nine to five day. ""I think that has probably been the biggest shock to my system, getting into that working routine,"" he said. Alpha Solway is taking in large numbers of new staff to cope with demand Alpha Solwaysecured a major contract to supply the NHS in Scotlandearlier this year which has helped to keep Mr Jones ""extremely busy"". However, flying gets ""into your blood"" and he hopes to get back into a plane at some time in the future. ""My goal is when the jobs start to come - which they will - I will return to the sky in some capacity,"" he said. ""But it will be a double-edged sword in that I have learned a huge amount here and I have met a lot of very good people. ""I'm working with a really good team of people here - there are good people here doing a good job and I am helping at least with that.""

'Urgent' aviation support plea over travel curbsAir industry bodies call for more support ahead of the UK's tighter quarantine rules on Monday.UK,"The UK's aviation sector ""urgently"" needs more government support if it is to survive another long period of travel curbs, industry groups say. From Monday, arrivals to the UK from all destinations will be required to quarantine in an effort to prevent the spread of any new variants of Covid. People will also have to show proof of a negative test taken in the previous 72 hours before travelling. The government said it was committed to supporting the travel industry. Underthe new rules beginning at 04:00 GMT on Monday,external, all travel corridors - which have been in place to allow arrivals from some countries to forgo quarantine - are being closed. All arrivals to the UK after that time will need to isolate for up to 10 days, although the quarantine period can be cut short with a negative test after five days. What are the new rules for travellers? Why hasn't the UK banned all international flights? UK to close all travel corridors from Monday With all parts of the UK under lockdown amid high levels of infection, only essential travel is permitted. There were 55,761 new confirmed cases recorded on Friday and 1,280 more people were reported to have died within 28 days of a positive test. Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced the changes at a Downing Street news conference on Friday, saying they would ""protect against the risk of as yet unidentified new strains"" of Covid. The new rules will be in place until at least 15 February, he said. The travel industry said closing the travel corridors was understandable due to the health emergency, but warned it would deepen the crisis for the sector. The Airport Operators Association said that there was ""only so long"" before airports might have to close temporarily to save costs and called for more support. Geoff Turner is currently teaching accounting and finance at the American University of Bahrain Geoff Turner is booked on a flight back to the UK with his wife on 2 February, two days after his contract working as a university professor in Bahrain comes to an end. After living in Australia for 40 years and travelling the world for 15 years, Geoff says he has nowhere to call home in the UK and needs to quickly find somewhere they can tell the authorities they will isolate under the government's new travel rules. He said: ""Nothing can be done now to change our flights. We'll have to quarantine for 10 days, meaning no work and no income. ""Is the government going to provide support during that time? I doubt it very much. ""It's the suddenness of it all. You find out that what you knew isn't what's happening anymore and it gets to a point where it's so late in the day you can't do anything about it."" Aban on travellers from South America, Portugal and Cape Verdealso came into force on Friday, having been imposed over concerns about a new variant identified in Brazil. New variants causing concern have previously been identifiedin the UKandSouth Africa, with many countries imposing restrictions on arrivals from both nations. Scientists fear the variants seen in South Africa and Brazil mayinterfere with the effectiveness of vaccines and evade parts of the immune system. Prof John Edmunds from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, a member of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, said the South Africa variant had already been detected in the UK and it was ""quite likely"" that the Brazilian one had been imported too. But he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the ""severe restrictions"" the UK is under would help to contain any cases of the new variants and make it harder for them to spread. Prof Edmunds warned relaxing restrictions at the end of February with only the most vulnerable having been given a first dose of the vaccine would be a ""disaster"". ""If we relaxed our restrictions we would immediately put the NHS under enormous pressure again,"" he said. Travel corridors were introduced in the summer to allow people to travel to and from some countries with low numbers of Covid cases without having to quarantine on their return. Tim Alderslade, chief executive of Airlines UK, said the system had been ""a lifeline for the industry"" last summer but ""things change and there's no doubting this is a serious health emergency"". He said he assumed the government would remove the latest restrictions as soon as it was safe. ""We've had no revenue now effectively for 12 months, give or take a few months in the summer last year. If we're going to have an aviation sector coming out of this we need to open up in the summer,"" he told the BBC. Abta, a trade association of travel agents and tour operators, said the government should provide support ""as a matter of urgency"" both for the jobs and businesses at risk, and ""in recognition of the important role the travel industry will play in the UK's economic recovery"". How worrying are the new Covid variants? Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said closing the travel corridors was the ""right step"" but called the timing of the decision ""slow again"", adding that the public would be thinking ""why on earth didn't this happen before"". Labour also criticised the effectiveness of the quarantine system, with shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds saying ""it's been a real problem"". Only about 3% of people were contacted to ensure they were quarantining, he said. But aviation minister Robert Courts told the Today programme there was a ""robust enforcement process"", with three million spot checks of the passenger locator forms which travellers are required to fill in on arrival. A Department for Transport spokesman said it was supporting the travel industry with an extension to the furlough scheme until the end of April, business rates relief and tax deferrals. Travel operators had already been forced to cancel holidays before the latest restrictions were announced. Earlier this week, Jet2 suspended all flights and holidays until 25 March over ""ongoing uncertainty"" and budget travel provider EasyJet on Thursday began cancelling holidays up to and including 24 March.

Northern Ireland records highest weekly Covid deaths,"Northern Ireland's statistics agency has recorded its highest weekly Covid-19 related registered deaths since the pandemic began. Nisra said 145 deaths were registered in the first week of 2021, although administrative delays over Christmas may have affected the number. That brings the agency's death toll to 1,976 by 8 January. The figures come as the chief medical officers from NI and the Republic issued a joint stay-at-home plea. Dr Michael McBride and Dr Tony Holohan said they were ""gravely concerned"" about the ""unsustainably high level of Covid-19 infection"" across the island of Ireland. Concern was raised in the Republic of Ireland this week as figures showedit has the world's highest number of confirmed new Covid-19 cases per million people. On Friday evening, the Irish Department of Health reported 50 further deaths with Covid-19 and 3,498 new cases of the virus. More than half (54%) of those newly diagnosed are under the age of 45. Northern Ireland is in the third week of a six-week lockdown, with ministers scheduled to review measures next week. Visiting suspended in NI hospitals due to Covid Minister tells big retail to stop non-essential trade NI to introduce international travel Covid tests However, health officials have warned that an extension of the restrictions could be required to reduce pressure on the health service. Of the 2,019 deaths recorded by Nisra by 8 January, 1,247 (62%) occurred in hospital, 622 (31%) in care homes, 12 (0.6%) in hospices and 138 (7%) at residential addresses or other locations. People aged 75 and over account for just over three-quarters of all Covid-19 related registered deaths (77.6%) between 19 March 2020 and 8 January 2021. Just over a fifth (22.2%) of all Covid-19 related registered deaths have been of people with an address in the Belfast council area. Meanwhile, the Department of Health reported 26 further Covid-related deaths on Friday. Five of these deaths did not occur in the past 24 hours. The Department of Health bases its figures on a positive test result being recorded, whereas Nisra figures are based on mentions of the virus on death certificates, so people may or may not have been confirmed to have contracted the virus prior to death. A further 1,052 individuals have tested positive for Covid-19 and 63 patients are being treated in intensive care units, 47 of whom are on ventilators. The chief medical officers warned the high infection rate was having a ""significant impact"" on the health of the population and the ""safe functioning"" of the healthcare systems. They said the public should avoid all unnecessary journeys, including cross-border travel. Pointing out that many of the patients admitted to hospital in January have been younger than 65, they warned coronavirus could affect anyone, ""regardless of age or underlying condition"". ""It highlights the need for us all to protect one another by staying at home,"" said the medical officers. Northern Ireland's spike in infections has been put down to an easing of restrictions over Christmas. Asked if he regretted being part of the decision to ease restrictions, Health Minister Robin Swann said the executive had tried to be balanced in its approach. ""I regret the pressures we see now in our hospitals, but let's remember it's caused by this virus, we have it in our power to bring it back under control and get us back to where we were in the summer,"" he told BBC News NI on Friday. Mr Swann pleaded with people to follow the current restrictions. ""We're in the middle of a very tough six-week scenario, and how we come out of this will be a more graduated approach to make sure we get the benefits of what we've already done, and also the benefits of the vaccine.""

Our coronavirus live page will be back tomorrow morning. The live page writers were Victoria Lindrea, Kelly-Leigh Cooper and Alex Therrien. The page was edited by James Clarke. We'll soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a pause for the day. But before we do, here is a round-up of today's main stories:  Bex Tonks said tens of thousands of eggs were at risk of being wasted Tens of thousands of free-range eggs are being donated to food banks by a farm in Cornwall that has seen demand plummet. St Ewe farm is home to 180,000 laying hens, but orders from the hospitality sector have dried up and the eggs are at risk of being wasted. So the farm has begun a campaign to avoid throwing them away, pointing out that hens ""can't be furloughed"". It is selling trays at a reduced rate and simultaneously donating a carton to a food bank or community kitchen for each sale. Bex Tonks, CEO of St Ewe said the ""Shell Out to Help Out"" campaign gave 20,000 eggs away last week, adding that it was ""really important to feed those who need it most"". ""It's tough times but we're all looking forward,"" she says. Louis Godwin descibed the vaccine as ""no trouble at all"" An RAF veteran has been among hundreds of people over 80 to receive the Covid-19 vaccine at Salisbury Cathedral, in Wiltshire, today. Former Flight Sergeant Louis Godwin described receiving the Pfizer/BioNTech jab as ""absolutely marvellous"". The landmark cathedral is hosting a vaccination hub for five GP surgeries in the area, with the aim of vaccinating more than 1,000 elderly residents and staff. Mr Godwin recalled having jabs in Egypt after the war ""which knocked me over for a week"". ""This one, the doctor said to me 'well that's done' - and I thought he hadn't started!"" The veteran pilot, who has 12 great-grandchildren, said the pandemic could not be compared to the war. ""It was entirely different because this has divided people. ""The vaccine is nothing, you don't feel a thing... so anybody that needs one and can get one, I would say go ahead and do it quickly. ""It's the only way we're going to beat the virus."" Patients queued for a short time around the cloisters on Saturday, before going into the cathedral where they were treated to a programme of music on the famous Father Willis organ. ""It is a bonus to be in such a iconic, wonderful place,"" said Dr Dan Henderson, co-clinical director for the Sarum South Primary Care Network. ""It's great to be getting the vaccine out there and getting them in people's arms and knowing that this is hopefully the start of some sort of normality again."" Karen Smith thinks she was infected on an extra shift she did because of staff shortages Everyone has heard about doctors and nurses catching Covid-19, but some of the worst affected hospital staff have been cleaners and porters. Dr John Wright of Bradford Royal Infirmary tells the story of a cleaner who became ill, and is now stricken with guilt for taking the virus home. The first person I see early each morning when I arrive at the hospital is our cleaner, Karen Smith. During 10 months of uncertainty, Karen has been the one constant, apart from a few weeks in spring, when she was ill with Covid-19. Usually Karen cleans the offices of the hospital's Institute for Health Research, but in the first wave of the pandemic she was called to the Covid wards. It was a frightening time for everyone, but Karen volunteered for an extra shift on Good Friday as there was a staff shortage. And on that day she thinks she was infected. Read more about Karen's case Corey Johnson died Thursday night and Dustin Higgs on Saturday morning Two US prisoners held on federal death row have been executed despite both testing positive for Covid-19 last month. Lawyers for both men argued their sentences should be delayed because damage to their lungs could mean the lethal dose of pentobarbital given to them leading to heightened suffering in their last moments, akin to a drowning sensation. A court ordered a stay of execution on these grounds earlier this week but the decision was overturned following a US government appeal. The number of reported incidents of children dying or being seriously harmed after suspected abuse or neglect rose by a quarter after England's first lockdown last year, figures indicate. The Child Safeguarding Practice Review Panelreceived 285 serious incident notifications,externalfrom April to September. This is an increase of 27% from the same period the previous year. The data also includes children who were in care and died, regardless of whether abuse or neglect was suspected. The Children's Society described the figures as ""shocking"". Read more Earlier this hour, the government released its daily UK coronavirus figures, which included a further 1,295 deaths. There are 37,475 Covid-19 patients in hospital. And as the below graphics show, while deaths are continuing to rise, there are signs daily cases may be falling. And you can read more here.  Portugal has registered a record rise of 10,947 new cases and 166 deaths on Saturday  - one day after a new national lockdown began. The Observador newspaper reports thatthree Lisbon area hospitals only had three intensive care beds left on Saturday,externaland queues of ambulances have been reported in places. Portugal has the lowest critical care capacity per 100,000 in Europe and experts warn hospital rates are likely to rise over the next week following a surge in cases after Christmas. The country was included in a travel ban implemented by the UK government this weekover fears of a new variant identified in Brazil. Along with the number of new deaths and cases, there was some more positive news in the government's daily coronavirus figures. The number of vaccinations in the UK up to 15 January now stands at 3,559,179 - up from 3,234,946 yesterday. Mike Hind paid for the meals himself as he had no time to fundraise A fitness trainer has responded to the outcry over inadequate free school food parcels by donating 3,000 meals. Images of the contents of some packages - given to children in England who qualify for free school meals and are learning remotely during the lockdown - have been shared and roundly criticised on social media. Mike Hind, 37, from Teesside, says the pictures he saw made him think: ""This is for a rabbit, not a child."" He paid for the meals himself because there was no time to fundraise but a local dairy donated milk and Morrisons supermarket donated fruit, he says. ""I've had people who've been walking two and three miles for these meals,"" he says. Read more A further 1,295 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test,according to the latest government figures,external. It takes the death toll by this measure to 88,590. A further 41,346 cases have been reported. There have been a total of 3,357, 361 cases. Some 5,000 Covid vaccinations are being given to health and social care staff on Saturday at a newly-created mass vaccination centre in Glasgow. The NHS Louisa Jordan is a temporary hospital constructed last year to treat Covid patients at Glasgow's SEC exhibition and conference centre.

Some 3,514,385 Covid-19 vaccinations have taken place in England since 8 December, according to provisional NHS England data. The figure, for jabs up to and including yesterday, includes first and second doses and is a rise of 324,711 on the statistics from 24 hours earlier. Of this number, 3,090,058 were the first dose of the vaccine, a rise of 320,894 on Friday's figures, while 424,327 were the second dose, an increase of 3,817. Pakistan's health minister, Faisal Sultan, says the country has given emergency use authorisation to the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca - making it the first to be approved nationally. The Drug
Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) is also currently reviewing the Chinese-made Sinopharm vaccine - with more than one million doses already ordered. Mr Sultan told Reuters that the country was speaking to a number of vaccine producers around the world: ""We have and are
watching the evolving stories around efficacy of a number of

Doctors and nurses should be protected from legal action over treatment decisions made under the pressures of the pandemic, medical bodies have said. The British Medical Association (BMA) is among the groups that have written to ministers, saying medical workers should not be at risk of unlawful killing charges. In November, Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned that in the face of the NHS being overwhelmed, ""doctors and nurses could be forced to choose which patients to treat, who would live and who would die"". A joint letter, co-ordinated by the Medical Protection Society (MPS), said - given the current public health emergency - medical staff were concerned ""that not only do they face being put in this position but also that they could subsequently be vulnerable to a criminal investigation by the police"". The letter was signed by the BMA, the Doctors' Association UK, the Hospital Consultants and Specialists' Association, the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin and Medical Defence Shield. It calls for emergency legislation to protect doctors and nurses from ""inappropriate"" legal action when dealing with circumstances outside their control. They said the change in the law should be temporary and should apply retrospectively from the start of the pandemic. The government said staff would be protected by indemnity schemes. Read more.

Disruption warning as snow hits parts of the UK,"Parts of the UK were blanketed in snow on Saturday as forecasters warned of the potential for disruption. East Anglia woke up to a thick layer that had settled overnight and there were warnings that rural communities could be ""cut off"", with up to 8cm (3in) of snow forecast. People in eastern England were warned to expect power cuts and travel delays. However, by midday snow had stopped falling across most parts of the UK, replaced by rain and sleet in places. Some further light snow is still expected in the hills and mountains of Scotland. Parts of Wales and Northern Ireland were mostly cloudy, with some bands of rain in the northern regions. In pictures: Winter scenes from around the UK Parts of East of England wake to snowy cold snap The Met Office had predicted between 4-8cm (1.5-3in) of snow could fall in the worst-affected regions, and warned drivers to accelerate their cars ""gently"" and leave a large gap between surrounding vehicles. But the worst of the wintry weather has passed and earlieramber and yellow weather warnings,externalhave been cancelled. Blackmoss Reservoir covered in snow in Barley, Pendle, Lancashire A man trekking through the snow at a golf course in Gleneagles Two women sledging in Gleneagles Greg Dewhurst, a Met Office forecaster, said earlier that Saturday was expected to be the colder of the two days over the weekend. He said: ""Temperatures are unlikely to rise above 10C, with a lot of areas closer to freezing."" There were also 25 flood warnings across England on Saturday Luke Miall, meteorologist at the Met Office, said earlier patches of snow could reach parts of Greater London. He said the snow had the potential to cause some ""fairly significant disruption"". There were also 22 flood warnings across England on Saturday, stretching from the South East to the North East, meaning ""immediate action is required"", according to the Environment Agency. This is expected to clear up in the evening, going into Sunday, when southern and eastern parts of the UK will see dry, sunny spells. North-western regions are expected to see showers, with a ""spell of more persistent rain"" later on in the day.

Thousands to be vaccinated at Salisbury Cathedral,"Louis Godwin said receiving the vaccine was ""no trouble at all"" and encouraged others to have it as soon as they could Salisbury Cathedral has been transformed into a vaccination centre with an RAF veteran being one of the first to receive the Covid-19 jab. Former Flight Sergeant Louis Godwin, 95, gave a thumbs-up after being vaccinated in the cathedral, which dates back more than 800 years.

New takeaway and shopping rules begin in Scotland,"New tighter Covid restrictions have come into force in Scotland with changes for takeaway outlets and click and collect shopping. Customers buying takeaway food and coffee are no longer allowed inside premises. Staff must serve from a hatch or doorway. Now only retailers selling essential items - clothing, footwear, baby equipment, homeware and books - can provide click and collect services. Customer collections can only be made outdoors, with staggered pick-up times to avoid queues. The changes are amongsix new rulesannounced by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon earlier this week. 1. Takeaway food and drinks 2. Click and collect shopping services 3. Outdoor alcohol consumption 4. Working from home 5. Home repairs and maintenance 6. Stay at Home message Ms Sturgeon said they were a ""regrettable but necessary means to an end"". The restrictions also include a ban on drinking alcohol outside in public in level four areas. This prevents takeaway pints from being consumed in parks or on the street. Statutory guidance has also been introduced requiring employers to support staff working from home wherever possible. Guidance on tradespeople working in homes has now been put into law. Work is only permitted for essential maintenance and repairs. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon announced the new rules to the Scottish parliament on Wednesday. The final new rule changes an ""apparent loophole"" in the stay at home regulations. The law now states that people must not leave ""or remain"" outside unless it is for an essential purpose. The tightened restrictions come amid concerns that the stay at home message across the UK isnot having the same impactit did during last year's lockdown. ""The situation we face in relation to the virus remains extremely serious,"" Ms Sturgeon told parliament. ""These additional measures, in further reducing the interactions that allow the virus to spread, will help our essential efforts to suppress it, "" she added.

"Northern Ireland records highest weekly Covid deathsStatistics agency Nisra says 145 deaths were registered last week, bringing its pandemic total to 1,976.Northern IrelandProtect us from unlawful killing charges - medicsHealth groups say NHS staff fear prosecution over decisions if hospitals are overwhelmed.UK","Northern Ireland's statistics agency has recorded its highest weekly Covid-19 related registered deaths since the pandemic began. Nisra said 145 deaths were registered in the first week of 2021, although administrative delays over Christmas may have affected the number. That brings the agency's death toll to 1,976 by 8 January. The figures come as the chief medical officers from NI and the Republic issued a joint stay-at-home plea. Dr Michael McBride and Dr Tony Holohan said they were ""gravely concerned"" about the ""unsustainably high level of Covid-19 infection"" across the island of Ireland. Concern was raised in the Republic of Ireland this week as figures showedit has the world's highest number of confirmed new Covid-19 cases per million people. On Friday evening, the Irish Department of Health reported 50 further deaths with Covid-19 and 3,498 new cases of the virus. More than half (54%) of those newly diagnosed are under the age of 45. Northern Ireland is in the third week of a six-week lockdown, with ministers scheduled to review measures next week. Visiting suspended in NI hospitals due to Covid Minister tells big retail to stop non-essential trade NI to introduce international travel Covid tests However, health officials have warned that an extension of the restrictions could be required to reduce pressure on the health service. Of the 2,019 deaths recorded by Nisra by 8 January, 1,247 (62%) occurred in hospital, 622 (31%) in care homes, 12 (0.6%) in hospices and 138 (7%) at residential addresses or other locations. People aged 75 and over account for just over three-quarters of all Covid-19 related registered deaths (77.6%) between 19 March 2020 and 8 January 2021. Just over a fifth (22.2%) of all Covid-19 related registered deaths have been of people with an address in the Belfast council area. Meanwhile, the Department of Health reported 26 further Covid-related deaths on Friday. Five of these deaths did not occur in the past 24 hours. The Department of Health bases its figures on a positive test result being recorded, whereas Nisra figures are based on mentions of the virus on death certificates, so people may or may not have been confirmed to have contracted the virus prior to death. A further 1,052 individuals have tested positive for Covid-19 and 63 patients are being treated in intensive care units, 47 of whom are on ventilators. The chief medical officers warned the high infection rate was having a ""significant impact"" on the health of the population and the ""safe functioning"" of the healthcare systems. They said the public should avoid all unnecessary journeys, including cross-border travel. Pointing out that many of the patients admitted to hospital in January have been younger than 65, they warned coronavirus could affect anyone, ""regardless of age or underlying condition"". ""It highlights the need for us all to protect one another by staying at home,"" said the medical officers. Northern Ireland's spike in infections has been put down to an easing of restrictions over Christmas. Asked if he regretted being part of the decision to ease restrictions, Health Minister Robin Swann said the executive had tried to be balanced in its approach. ""I regret the pressures we see now in our hospitals, but let's remember it's caused by this virus, we have it in our power to bring it back under control and get us back to where we were in the summer,"" he told BBC News NI on Friday. Mr Swann pleaded with people to follow the current restrictions. ""We're in the middle of a very tough six-week scenario, and how we come out of this will be a more graduated approach to make sure we get the benefits of what we've already done, and also the benefits of the vaccine.""

GPs warned about delay to batch of Covid vaccinesOne health board says it has contacted doctors to suggest delaying vaccination appointments.WalesProtect us from unlawful killing charges - medicsHealth groups say NHS staff fear prosecution over decisions if hospitals are overwhelmed.UK,"This video can not be played How will I get my Covid-19 vaccine in Wales? GPs in north Wales are being advised to consider delaying Covid-19 vaccine appointments early next week due to a hold-up affecting about 26,000 doses. Betsi Cadwaladr health board, which manages healthcare in the area, said it was a national issue which was expected to be ""resolved in the coming days"". The Welsh Government said one Oxford-AstraZeneca batch out of four had been delayed. It had been due to be shared between Wales' seven health boards. It said rollout plans were unaffected. The Welsh Government said it had been assured it would get more Pfizer vaccines by February, despite shipments of it beingtemporarily slowedbecause of changes to the company's manufacturing processes. Four per cent of the Welsh population have received a vaccine so far. Chris Stockport, executive director primary and community care at Betsi Cadwaladr University Health Board, said the organisation was ""notified of a delay in releasing a batch of vaccines which would have disrupted supply nationally in the middle of next week"". Will mass Covid testing be offered across Wales? When, where and how will I get my Covid vaccine? Case rates fall in Covid hotspots as 54 people die ""To help minimise disruption and anxiety, we informed GP practices of this supply issue at the earliest opportunity, and suggested they may wish to delay appointments early next week,"" he said. ""We expect that this issue will be resolved in the coming days, and we expect a further allocation of vaccines will arrive over the coming week. ""We are now in the process of working with our partners in primary care to minimise any disruption and continue the rollout of vaccinations across north Wales."" UK government figuresshow 126,375 people in Wales, 4% of the population, have received their first jab so far. The Welsh Government'svaccine strategysays everyone will be offered a jab by autumn. It is not known why one of four batches has been held up. Dr Phil White, chair of BMA Wales' general practitioners' committee which represents doctors, said it was ""not unprecedented"" for a batch of vaccines to be withheld, as happened with flu vaccines in 2019. He said almost one million flu vaccines have been administered this season, so 26,000 Covid vaccines was a ""tiny amount"" which would be made up. ""It's really an inconvenience and will lead to some appointments being cancelled but, hopefully, we can make up for that as soon as the batch is replaced,"" he said. A Welsh Government spokeswoman confirmed each batch contains about 26,000 doses. She said it would not affect its plan to vaccinate priority groups by mid-February. ""We were recently notified that one of the four batches of the vaccine we had anticipated receiving this week will be delayed, and not available until the week commencing 25 January,"" she said. ""This does not affect our overall expected delivery volumes or expectations for hitting the milestones set out in ourCovid-19 Vaccination Strategy for Wales,external."" Meanwhile,several EU countries have said they are receiving significantly fewer dosesof thePfizer vaccinesthan expected after the US company slowed shipments. But the Welsh Government said it has been ""assured"" by the UK government that it will receive further Pfizer vaccines by February. ""We are aware of a slowing down in supply from Pfizer's European production which may have implications on the rate at which we can vaccinate more people as we move to administer the second doses,"" said the spokeswoman. Wales has received about 250,000 doses of thePfizer/BioNTech vaccineand 50,000 doses of theOxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, according to First Minister Mark Drakeford. This video can not be played Mark Drakeford says there is âsignificant evidenceâ of coronavirus transmission in supermarkets He told Friday's Welsh Government briefing a further supply of Pfizer vaccines was expected in late January or earlier February, along with a ""significant upswing in the Oxford vaccine coming to Wales next week"". Regarding the Pfizer vaccine, he said: ""What you can't do is to try and stand up a system which uses all the vaccines you've got in week one and then has nothing to offer for the next four weeks. ""That's why you haven't seen it all used in week one because we've got to space it out over the weeks that it's got to cover."" But Paul Davies, leader of the Conservatives in the Senedd, said it was""clear we are lagging behind""the rest of the UK in Covid vaccinations. He said it was ""important now to get those vaccines out to people"". Plaid Cymru has said it makes ""little sense"" to spread out the vaccines, when ""time is of the essence"". ""The Welsh Government must set out and make public a clearer and more comprehensive strategy on vaccines,"" said Plaid's health spokesman Rhun ap Iorwerth. ""This can help ensure that the priority groups are being vaccinated as quickly as possible, so we can move on to other groups of essential workers."" Will mass Covid testing be offered across Wales?

Hauliers 'bypassing Welsh ports because of Brexit',"Irish hauliers have been bypassing ports in Wales because of Brexit, say industry leaders Irish hauliers are bypassing Welsh ports to avoid Brexit bureaucracy, industry leaders say. So-called ""teething problems"" with new export rules are causing ""enormous strain on staff"", according to one haulage company. But others warn of a longer-term shift by truck firms from using Holyhead, Fishguard and Pembroke Dock. Gwynedd Shipping said it was operating at 65% normal volumes and the pressure of extra paperwork was challenging. Andrew Kinsella, the firm's managing director, said: ""It's an enormous strain on our staff in terms of processing bookings. Covid tests for Channel hauliers to continue 'until further notice' 'Most difficult week I've had in this job in 20 years' Truckers who tested negative board ferries for France ""We process around 400 or 500 bookings a week, the reality is we're operating at 65-70% of previous volumes. ""Whilst we see recovery in the number of clients and we're starting to get to a better pattern in terms of shipments I still think it's going to take several weeks for things to return to normal. Whether things return to pre-Christmas, pre-Brexit volumes remains to be seen."" Mr Kinsella thinks there will be long-term consequences for the ports. Stena Line is among firms that have made changes to the routes its uses ""You can already see the shift in terms of the number of sailings,"" he said. ""I think you're seeing a shift away from Holyhead particularly in terms of weekend, off-peak traffic. I think longer term, the viability of all of these services will be something those ferry services will continue to scrutinise."" This week Stena Line moved its new ship to the route from Rosslare, in the Republic of Ireland, to Cherbourg, France. According to Irish public broadcaster RTÃ, a new weekend sailing from Dublin to Cherbourg will also begin on 23 January, resulting in a temporary reduction in weekend capacity on the Dublin to Holyhead route.  It also intends to sail the Belfast-to-Liverpool route. ""Due to the current Brexit-related shift for direct routes and increasing customer demand, Stena Line has decided to temporarily deploy the Stena Embla on Rosslare-Cherbourg,"" Stena Line said. At Rosslare Europort, business is booming, says general manager Glenn Carr. ""We've seen unprecedented demand in the first two weeks of trading compared to last year,"" Mr Carr said. ""On our European routes there's a 500% increase in freight volume going through the port compared to last year."" He added that 18 months ago they would have had three sailings a week directly to mainland Europe from Rosslare Europort: ""Today we have 15."" Mr Carr says his customers want to bypass the UK because of Brexit. ""I think that's testament to demand, particularly from our exporters and importers, on the island of Ireland and the need to unfortunately bypass the UK because of Brexit to trade directly with the EU,"" he added. He believes this change in operations will not be temporary. He said decisions by ferry companies and businesses who trade with the EU to re-direct freight, have been made based on market analysis. ""The business case for the extra services out of Rosslare were not based on the first two weeks of this year,"" Mr Carr said. ""They were based on analysis of the market and conversations with our exporters and importers who were switching. ""So there is a genuine switch and we foresee services being maintained out of Rosslare."" UK government ministers have played down concerns about the long term viability of Welsh ports. Giving evidence to the Welsh Affairs Select Committee this week, Wales Office Minister David TC Davies MP, said former haulage industry colleagues referred to the issues as ""teething problems"". Secretary of State for Wales Simon Hart MP, said: ""There is some evidence that things aren't looking necessarily, permanently bleak. ""It's one of those areas where we have to keep a very wary eye on it, but I think and hope that it is a temporary dip in the graph."" But transport expert Prof Stuart Cole, of the University of South Wales, thinks Brexit delays will be the incentive Irish companies needed to switch permanently to trading directly with the European mainland. Prof Cole said the EU wanted to reduce congestion and pollution in parts of Europe. One solution was to move freight by sea rather than road. There have been problems with paperwork for drivers travelling to the European mainland Until now there was no reason for Irish hauliers to move from using Welsh ports and Dover, Prof Cole said. ""The route worked perfectly, there was a predictable journey time and that's important for food and component parts going to factories,"" he said. ""That kind of change required a significant shift, and that's what's there now."" Bangor University economics lecturer, Dr Edward Thomas Jones, believes it is too soon to predict longer term changes. ""Because businesses stockpiled before Christmas in anticipation of Brexit, there is of course less use of the port [at Holyhead] since Brexit,"" he said. ""On top of that, coronavirus means there are fewer tourists going on holiday to Ireland. ""We'll have a better idea of the future of the port in six months when these businesses who have stockpiled start buying again. ""Hopefully, by the second half of the year coronavirus will have been resolved and tourists will once again be able to travel back and forth."" Plaid Cymru warned if traffic continued to be diverted away from the UK then Wales would suffer. ""I urge the UK government to work with the Welsh Government to provide substantial investment into Welsh ports to secure their viability into the future,"" said MP Hywel Williams, Plaid's Cabinet Office spokesman. ""If the trend of rerouting traffic through direct routes continues, I fear that our local economies both in the north west and south west of Wales will suffer enormously.""

New takeaway and shopping rules begin in ScotlandTakeaway outlets and click and collect retail services must change how they operate in Scotland.Scotland,"New tighter Covid restrictions have come into force in Scotland with changes for takeaway outlets and click and collect shopping. Customers buying takeaway food and coffee are no longer allowed inside premises. Staff must serve from a hatch or doorway. Now only retailers selling essential items - clothing, footwear, baby equipment, homeware and books - can provide click and collect services. Customer collections can only be made outdoors, with staggered pick-up times to avoid queues. The changes are amongsix new rulesannounced by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon earlier this week. 1. Takeaway food and drinks 2. Click and collect shopping services 3. Outdoor alcohol consumption 4. Working from home 5. Home repairs and maintenance 6. Stay at Home message Ms Sturgeon said they were a ""regrettable but necessary means to an end"". The restrictions also include a ban on drinking alcohol outside in public in level four areas. This prevents takeaway pints from being consumed in parks or on the street. Statutory guidance has also been introduced requiring employers to support staff working from home wherever possible. Guidance on tradespeople working in homes has now been put into law. Work is only permitted for essential maintenance and repairs. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon announced the new rules to the Scottish parliament on Wednesday. The final new rule changes an ""apparent loophole"" in the stay at home regulations. The law now states that people must not leave ""or remain"" outside unless it is for an essential purpose. The tightened restrictions come amid concerns that the stay at home message across the UK isnot having the same impactit did during last year's lockdown. ""The situation we face in relation to the virus remains extremely serious,"" Ms Sturgeon told parliament. ""These additional measures, in further reducing the interactions that allow the virus to spread, will help our essential efforts to suppress it, "" she added.

"Nasa's 'megarocket' set to fire up enginesThe four main engines for Nasa's new ""megarocket"" are to be fired in unison for the first time.Science & Environment","This video can not be played The four main engines were fired in unison for the first time, but had to be shut down early A critical engine test for Nasa's new ""megarocket"" has ended early, but the agency denied it amounted to a failure. Shortly before 22:30 GMT (17:30 EST) on Saturday, the four engines ignited, burning for more than a minute before the event was aborted. The core stage of the Space Launch System (SLS) was being evaluated at Stennis Space Center, in Mississippi. The engines were supposed to fire for eight minutes to simulate the rocket's climb to orbit. The SLS is part of Nasa's Artemis programme, which aims to put Americans back on the lunar surface in the 2020s. When it makes its maiden flight - possibly later this year - the SLS will become the most powerful rocket ever to have flown to space. Teams at Stennis are still poring over the data to find out what happened. John Honeycutt, SLS program manager at Nasa's Marshall Space Flight Center in Alabama, said there were ""a lot of dynamics going on"" when the engine shut down. Nasa's giant SLS rocket: a guide Nasa's new 'megarocket' set for critical tests Artemis: To the Moon and beyond The engines' power levels were being throttled down and up again; they were also being prepared to pivot - or gimbal. This movement allows the rocket to be steered during flight. The RS-25 engines are the same type that powered the space shuttle orbiter ""We did see a little bit of a flash come from around the interface between the thermal protection blanket on engine four at the time when we had initiated the gimbal,"" Honeycutt told reporters at a post-test briefing at Stennis. The as-yet unknown problem triggered what Nasa calls a failure identification (Fid), followed by a major component failure (MCF). As a result of the fault, an onboard computer known as the engine controller sent a message to another computer called the core stage controller, which took a decision to shut down the vehicle. ""Any parameter that went awry on the engine could have sent that failure ID,"" said John Honeycutt. It was the first time all four RS-25 engines had been ignited together, in a test known as a ""hotfire"". The core stage of the rocket was anchored to a massive steel structure called the B-2 test stand on the grounds of the Stennis facility. To prepare the core stage, engineers filled its tanks with more than 700,000 gallons (2.6 million litres) of super-cold liquid hydrogen and oxygen propellant. This was the eighth and final test in the Green Run, a programme of evaluation carried out by engineers from Nasa and Boeing - the rocket's prime contractor. Although the test was intended to run for eight minutes, engineers would have received all the data required to certify the rocket for flight after 250 seconds. They wanted to iron out any problems before the core stage is used for the first SLS launch, in which it will send Nasa's next-generation Orion spacecraft on a loop around the Moon. Nasa's outgoing administrator Jim Bridenstine declined to call Saturday's event a failure: ""This is why we test,"" he said, adding: ""Before we put American astronauts on American rockets, that's when we need it to be perfect."" Officials have not yet decided whether to re-run the hotfire, or proceed with shipping the core stage to Kennedy Space Center (KSC) in Florida to prepare it for the rocket's uncrewed maiden flight, a mission called Artemis-1. ""It depends what the anomaly was and how challenging it's going to be to fix it,"" said Bridenstine. Nasa administrator Jim Bridenstine said perfection wasn't a realistic expectation for the first engine test Asked whether a launch this year was still feasible, he added: ""I think it's too early to tell. As we figure out what went wrong, we're going to know what the future holds."" However, if one or more of the engines needs to be replaced, there are spares waiting to be used at Stennis Space Center. The Artemis-1 mission will evaluate how both the SLS and Orion capsule perform prior to Nasa staging a repeat of this lunar loop with astronauts in 2023. This will be followed by the first landing on the Moon by humans since the Apollo 17 mission in 1972. The SLS consists of the 65m (212 ft) -long core stage with two smaller solid rocket boosters (SRBs) attached to the sides. Engineers at KSC have begun stacking the individual SRB segments for Artemis-1. ""This powerful rocket is going to put us in a position to be ready to support the agency and the country in deep space missions to the Moon and beyond,"" John Honeycutt said during a media briefing on Tuesday. Artwork: The initial version of the SLS - known as Block 1 - during the climb to orbit Officials have been planning to ship the core stage to Florida in February. Its engines are of the same type that powered the spaceplane-like shuttle orbiter - America's crewed space vehicle for 30 years from 1981-2011. Nasa is re-using flown hardware: the RS-25 engines used in this test helped launch 21 shuttle missions. Two were used on the last shuttle flight - STS-135 in 2011. The four RS-25s can generate 1.6 million lbs (7 Meganewtons) of thrust - the force that propels a rocket through the air. When the solid rocket boosters are added to the core stage, the combined system will produce 8.8 million pounds (39.1 Meganewtons) of thrust. This will make it 15% more powerful than the giant Saturn V rocket that sent astronauts to the Moon in the 1960s and 70s. Prior to Saturday's test, John Shannon, vice president and SLS program manager at Boeing praised teams at Stennis for keeping the Green Run on track despite the pandemic and this year's particularly active hurricane season.

EU nations hit by delayed Pfizer vaccine deliveries,"A nurse prepares a dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech Covid-19 vaccine in Cannes, France Several EU countries are receiving significantly fewer doses of the Pfizer coronavirus vaccine than expected, after the US firm slowed shipments. Six nations called the situation ""unacceptable"" and warned it ""decreases the credibility of the vaccination process"". Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia urged the EU to apply pressure on Pfizer-BioNTech. Pfizer said the reduced deliveries were a temporary issue. In a statement on Friday, the drugmaker said shipments were being affected by changes to its manufacturing processes designed to boost production. ""Although this will temporarily impact shipments in late January to early February, it will provide a significant increase in doses available for patients in late February and March,"" Pfizer said. Whatâs happening to the EU vaccine scheme? Coronavirus cases, deaths, vaccinations by country Shocked to be Europe's vaccination stragglers The company said its production upgrades would also have a ""short-term impact"" on the delivery of vaccines to the UK. Despite this, the UK government said it still planned to hit its target of vaccinating all priority groups by mid-February - about 15 million people. The vaccine from Pfizer is not the only candidate available in the UK, with the University of Oxford and AstraZeneca jab also currently being rolled out. The EU is not wholly reliant on the Pfizer jab either, having approved a vaccine manufactured by US company Moderna for use. Still, the development is expected to slow the pace of vaccination programmes. The German health ministry called Pfizer's announcement surprising and regrettable, noting that it had committed to binding delivery dates until mid-February. EU Commission President Ursula von der Leyen said she had been assured by Pfizer's chief executive that all orders guaranteed for delivery in the first quarter of the year would arrive. Last week, Ms von der Leyen said Pfizer had agreed to supply the EU with 600 million doses this year, double its initial order. The pledge may do little to soothe European governments battling to subdue a fast-spreading Covid-19 variant first detected in the UK. About a third of the 27 EU governments reported having ""insufficient"" vaccine doses at a meeting this week, Reuters reported, citing a participant. Lithuania said it would now get only half as many Pfizer vaccine doses as promised until mid-February. Belgium said it expected to receive about half the planned doses in January. Canada is also affected, because its vaccine supplies come from a Pfizer factory in Belgium. Norway, which is not an EU member, said on Friday that Pfizer was temporarily reducing the number of vaccine doses delivered to the country as of next week. The Norwegian Institute of Public Health said in a statement that it could supplement the loss using ""emergency stock"". ""The stock we now have will be able to compensate for a reduction in the planned deliveries for a few weeks ahead,"" it said. As well as Pfizer-BioNTech, the European Commission has reached agreements with five other pharmaceutical companies to purchase hundreds of millions of vaccines, once they pass clinical trials: AstraZeneca: 400 million doses Sanofi-GSK: 300 million doses Johnson & Johnson: 400 million doses CureVac: 405 million doses Moderna: 160 million doses The Commission concluded initial talks with another company,Novavax, for up to 200 million doses. Elsewhere in the world, Turkey said it had vaccinated half a million people in two days with vaccines developed by China's Sinovac Biotech. The figures suggest Turkey vaccinated more people on the first day of its roll-out than France did in almost three weeks. The French government faced a storm of criticism after it emerged that only 500 people had been vaccinated in the first week of the roll-out, which began in late December. Vaccination efforts have since stepped up, though, with 388,730 people receiving at least one dose so far,according to CovidTracker,external. In the US, President-elect Joe Biden on Friday unveiled an ambitious plan to ramp up vaccinations against Covid-19 when he takes office on 20 January. Mr Biden said his administration would set up new mass vaccination centres and hire extra health workers to achieve his target of inoculating 100 million Americans within his first 100 days in office. The incoming president made the announcement asthe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) issued a stark warning about the spread of a highly transmissible coronavirus variantin the US. India, meanwhile,launched the world's largest vaccination campaign on Saturday. Efforts are under way to inoculate 1.3 billion people against the disease, starting with healthcare and frontline workers. Two vaccines - Covishield (the local name for the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine) and Covaxin - are being used in India.

US expects 'rapid growth' of virus variant,"The US is in a race to vaccinate its population amid a winter surge A highly contagious coronavirus variant first detected in the UK could become the dominant strain in the US by March, health officials have said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned of ""rapid growth"" of the variant in coming weeks. It said such a spike could further threaten health systems already strained by a winter Covid surge. The warning came on Friday as President-elect Joe Biden unveiled an ambitious plan to ramp up vaccinations. To meet his target of inoculating 100 million Americans within his first 100 days in office, Mr Biden said his administration would take a more active role in accelerating the distribution of vaccines. He outlined a plan to set up new mass vaccination centres, hire extra health workers, and ensure the shot is available to everyone, including minority communities that have been hit hardest by the epidemic. How will the world vaccinate seven billion people? Covid map: Where have the two million deaths been? Official data shows that, so far, 12.2 million vaccine doses of have been administered in the US,external- a figure Mr Biden has criticised as insufficient. More than 30 million doses have been distributed to states. In a speech on Friday, Mr Biden told Americans that ""we remain in a very dark winter"", admitting that ""things will get worse before they get better"". ""This is going to be one of the most challenging operational efforts ever undertaken by our country,"" Mr Biden, who takes office on 20 January, said of the vaccination drive. His address came a day afterhe announced a $1.9tn (Â£1.4tn) stimulus packagefor the battered US economy that included a further $20bn for the vaccine roll-out. The plan will need to pass Congress. This video can not be played Biden: ""I promise we will not forget you"" The US has recorded the highest number of confirmed coronavirus infections - 23.5 million - of any country in the world. At about 391,000, the country's coronavirus deaths account for a fifth of the global total, which passed the two-million mark on Friday. The crisis is particularly acute in the state of California, where deaths have surged by more than 1,000% since November. Inside California's struggle to contain the virus In its report,external, the CDC said that the UK variant would spread quickly in the coming weeks. The latest research by Public Health England (PHE),externalsuggests the variant - now dominant in much of Britain - is between 30% and 50% more transmissible than previous strains. There is currently no evidence to suggest it causes any more serious illness. Experts have also played down the possibility that the current vaccines will not be as effective against it. How worrying are the new coronavirus variants? So far, 76 people from 10 US states have been confirmed to have been infected with the UK variant, known as B.1.1.7. But the CDC said: ""The modelled trajectory of this variant in the US exhibits rapid growth in early 2021, becoming the predominant variant in March."" Two other variants - one from South Africa and one from Brazil - are also thought to be more contagious than the original one that started the pandemic.

PM says girls' education key to stopping poverty,"The international community has missed previous deadlines on ensuring access to school Boris Johnson says it is his ""fervent belief"" that improving girls' education in developing countries is the best way to ""lift communities out of poverty"". The prime minister has announced MP Helen Grant as a special envoy for efforts to support girls' education. It is expected to be a key theme of the UK's presidency this year of the G7 group of major industrial countries. ""It can change the fortunes of not just individual women and girls, but communities and nations,"" says the PM. Even before the pandemic, millions of children in developing countries did not have any access to school - and girls from disadvantaged families are particularly vulnerable to missing out on education. whether through poverty or prejudice. The Covid pandemic has created even more barriers to education, with a peak of 1.6 billion children around the world having faced school closures. Boris Johnson wants girls' education to be a focus of the UK's G7 presidency Mr Johnson, as foreign secretary and prime minister, has previously highlighted girls' education as akey to improving the health, wealth and security of the poorest countries. He once described it as the ""Swiss army knife"" of development, as getting girls to stay in education could avoid early marriage, improve their chances of getting a job and provide more income for children to be better fed. Boris Johnson says girls' education is key to global progress Backlash over cut to overseas aid 10 toughest places for girls to go to school What's it like to start reading at 60? The prime minister said the international target of ensuring all girls can have 12 years of good quality education would be the ""simplest and most transformative thing we can do"" to tackle poverty and to ""end the scourge of gender-based violence"". ""The benefits of educating girls are enormous - a child whose mother can read is 50% more likely to live past the age of five and twice as likely to attend school themselves. With just one additional school year, a woman's earnings can increase by up to a fifth,"" said Mr Johnson. Helen Grant, now the special envoy for girls' education, said: ""High quality female education empowers women, reduces poverty and unleashes economic growth. ""I will be making it my mission to encourage a more ambitious approach to girls' education from the international community."" There has been a series of pledges from the international community over the past three decades to provide at least a primary school education for all children - all of which have been missed. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said hosting the G7 should be a chance for the UK to act as a ""moral force for good in the world"", but accused the Conservatives of engaging in ""a decade of global retreat"". ""We need to seize this chance to lead again, just as Blair and Brown did over global poverty and the financial crisis.""

Lumley 'shocked' at claims disabled workers unpaid,"Joanna Lumley in a video promoting Clarity Products in 2011 Disabled workers at one of the UK's oldest charitable enterprises, Clarity, have allegedly been denied Â£200,000 in wages by the new owner. The company produces toiletries and beauty products under the Clarity, Beco and Soap Co brands. Actress Joanna Lumley and Sir Iain Duncan Smith MP have spoken out strongly over the claims. Nicholas Marks, who bought the company last year, says all currently employed staff have been paid. Community, the union which represents Clarity's workers, claims that a number of disabled employees at the firm have not been paid wages and furlough payments. Stephen Steppens says he has received no money since September Stephen Steppens, 60, has been blind since birth, and has worked at Clarity since 1985. He is officially on furlough until his redundancy is completed at the end of January. He says he has received no money since September and has been relying on his savings to get by. ""I loved it,"" he says of working there. Losing the job, and the fight over the organisation's future, have taken a toll on his mental health, he says. ""I want to see justice done, not just for me, but also for my friends who are visiting food banks."" Man quit after 20 years over furlough 'nightmare' A number of employees have brought successful employment tribunal claims for unauthorised deduction of wages against Clarity, including Mr Steppens. Clarity was ordered to pay him Â£706. A number of other employment tribunal claims are ongoing, according to Community. Joanna Lumley, who had been a supporter of Clarity, called it ""the best of the best"" and said she was ""shocked"" to learn of the allegations over treatment of workers. ""Justice must be done as soon as possible,"" she told BBC News. Clarity was founded in 1854 by a wealthy blind woman, Elizabeth Gilbert, as the Association for Promoting the General Welfare of the Blind, to provide opportunities for workers whom other employers overlooked because of their disabilities. Before the takeover, three-quarters of its staff were disabled people. A factory in London run by General Welfare of the Blind, about 1901 Its supporters and patrons in the past have included Winston Churchill, Charles Dickens and Queen Victoria. Clarity went into administration last year, as it was losing money and unable to fund the hole in its pension scheme, according to a spokesman for the administrators, FRP. In January, it was bought by Nicholas Marks. Sir Iain Duncan Smith, whose London constituency is home to Clarity's headquarters, raised the issue in the House of Commons on 12 January. ""Staff have failed to receive national insurance contributions, with many failing to receive their wages or support while undertaking childcare,"" he told MPs. ""The total amount that these decent but very vulnerable people have failed to receive is now around Â£200,000. They cannot claim benefits because they are essentially employed."" Community estimates that about 60 former employees of Clarity are still awaiting payment of their wages and furlough payments, most of them disabled workers. A spokesman for Nicholas Marks said that Sir Iain's remarks were ""highly inaccurate"" and the company ""does not recognise"" the Â£200,000 figure. ""The grievances echoed by Sir Iain Duncan Smith simply reflect disgruntled ex-employees. All employees currently working have been paid in full up-to-date and the company is dealing with redundancies and gross misconduct of former employees,"" he said. Community says it is not aware of any staff who have been dismissed for gross misconduct. The spokesman for Mr Marks said that Mr Marks had ""saved this historic company from permanent failure"". However, other bids for Clarity were made, including one from the well-known social entrepreneur, Cemal Ezel, who runs the Change Please coffee business, which creates opportunities for homeless people. He is still interested in buying the brands, he told BBC News. Cemal Ezel, founder of Change Please Though Mr Ezel's final bid was slightly higher, the administrators' report says they chose to sell to Mr Marks because he was in a better position to complete the deal by 31 January. Mr Marks's spokesman said that he had to make ""some sensible commercial decisions to place it on to a proper business footing and regrettably some staff had to be let go"". On Wednesday, Clarity's website was still running the Certified Social Enterprise mark, denoting an organisation devoted to ""creating positive social change"". The spokesman said Clarity Products was not a social enterprise and was not ""purporting to clients"" that it was, though it retained the ""social enterprise ethos through the continued employment of fully paid disabled staff"". Wrongly using the logo for nearly a year was ""simply an oversight"", and it is being removed. On Thursday morning, the website was unavailable - the company spokesman said he was not aware why. In a response to Sir Iain's query, Treasury Minister Jesse Norman wrote that he had ""specifically asked HMRC to note the circumstances you describe, and to consider whether and how there may be a case for early intervention"". Another company owned by Mr Marks, a Preston-based caravan maker called Lunar Automotive, was reported to HMRC by the local MP, Sir Mark Hendrick, for allegedly refusing to pay wages and pension contributions for its workers. This company was also bought out of an administration run by FRP. Mr Marks's spokesman was not able to comment in detail on the Lunar Automotive case, but said the company had not heard back from HMRC.

Our coronavirus live page will be back tomorrow morning. The live page writers were Victoria Lindrea, Kelly-Leigh Cooper and Alex Therrien. The page was edited by James Clarke. We'll soon be bringing our coronavirus live page to a pause for the day. But before we do, here is a round-up of today's main stories:  Bex Tonks said tens of thousands of eggs were at risk of being wasted Tens of thousands of free-range eggs are being donated to food banks by a farm in Cornwall that has seen demand plummet. St Ewe farm is home to 180,000 laying hens, but orders from the hospitality sector have dried up and the eggs are at risk of being wasted. So the farm has begun a campaign to avoid throwing them away, pointing out that hens ""can't be furloughed"". It is selling trays at a reduced rate and simultaneously donating a carton to a food bank or community kitchen for each sale. Bex Tonks, CEO of St Ewe said the ""Shell Out to Help Out"" campaign gave 20,000 eggs away last week, adding that it was ""really important to feed those who need it most"". ""It's tough times but we're all looking forward,"" she says. Louis Godwin descibed the vaccine as ""no trouble at all"" An RAF veteran has been among hundreds of people over 80 to receive the Covid-19 vaccine at Salisbury Cathedral, in Wiltshire, today. Former Flight Sergeant Louis Godwin described receiving the Pfizer/BioNTech jab as ""absolutely marvellous"". The landmark cathedral is hosting a vaccination hub for five GP surgeries in the area, with the aim of vaccinating more than 1,000 elderly residents and staff. Mr Godwin recalled having jabs in Egypt after the war ""which knocked me over for a week"". ""This one, the doctor said to me 'well that's done' - and I thought he hadn't started!"" The veteran pilot, who has 12 great-grandchildren, said the pandemic could not be compared to the war. ""It was entirely different because this has divided people. ""The vaccine is nothing, you don't feel a thing... so anybody that needs one and can get one, I would say go ahead and do it quickly. ""It's the only way we're going to beat the virus."" Patients queued for a short time around the cloisters on Saturday, before going into the cathedral where they were treated to a programme of music on the famous Father Willis organ. ""It is a bonus to be in such a iconic, wonderful place,"" said Dr Dan Henderson, co-clinical director for the Sarum South Primary Care Network. ""It's great to be getting the vaccine out there and getting them in people's arms and knowing that this is hopefully the start of some sort of normality again."" Karen Smith thinks she was infected on an extra shift she did because of staff shortages Everyone has heard about doctors and nurses catching Covid-19, but some of the worst affected hospital staff have been cleaners and porters. Dr John Wright of Bradford Royal Infirmary tells the story of a cleaner who became ill, and is now stricken with guilt for taking the virus home. The first person I see early each morning when I arrive at the hospital is our cleaner, Karen Smith. During 10 months of uncertainty, Karen has been the one constant, apart from a few weeks in spring, when she was ill with Covid-19. Usually Karen cleans the offices of the hospital's Institute for Health Research, but in the first wave of the pandemic she was called to the Covid wards. It was a frightening time for everyone, but Karen volunteered for an extra shift on Good Friday as there was a staff shortage. And on that day she thinks she was infected. Read more about Karen's case Corey Johnson died Thursday night and Dustin Higgs on Saturday morning Two US prisoners held on federal death row have been executed despite both testing positive for Covid-19 last month. Lawyers for both men argued their sentences should be delayed because damage to their lungs could mean the lethal dose of pentobarbital given to them leading to heightened suffering in their last moments, akin to a drowning sensation. A court ordered a stay of execution on these grounds earlier this week but the decision was overturned following a US government appeal. The number of reported incidents of children dying or being seriously harmed after suspected abuse or neglect rose by a quarter after England's first lockdown last year, figures indicate. The Child Safeguarding Practice Review Panelreceived 285 serious incident notifications,externalfrom April to September. This is an increase of 27% from the same period the previous year. The data also includes children who were in care and died, regardless of whether abuse or neglect was suspected. The Children's Society described the figures as ""shocking"". Read more Earlier this hour, the government released its daily UK coronavirus figures, which included a further 1,295 deaths. There are 37,475 Covid-19 patients in hospital. And as the below graphics show, while deaths are continuing to rise, there are signs daily cases may be falling. And you can read more here.  Portugal has registered a record rise of 10,947 new cases and 166 deaths on Saturday  - one day after a new national lockdown began. The Observador newspaper reports thatthree Lisbon area hospitals only had three intensive care beds left on Saturday,externaland queues of ambulances have been reported in places. Portugal has the lowest critical care capacity per 100,000 in Europe and experts warn hospital rates are likely to rise over the next week following a surge in cases after Christmas. The country was included in a travel ban implemented by the UK government this weekover fears of a new variant identified in Brazil. Along with the number of new deaths and cases, there was some more positive news in the government's daily coronavirus figures. The number of vaccinations in the UK up to 15 January now stands at 3,559,179 - up from 3,234,946 yesterday. Mike Hind paid for the meals himself as he had no time to fundraise A fitness trainer has responded to the outcry over inadequate free school food parcels by donating 3,000 meals. Images of the contents of some packages - given to children in England who qualify for free school meals and are learning remotely during the lockdown - have been shared and roundly criticised on social media. Mike Hind, 37, from Teesside, says the pictures he saw made him think: ""This is for a rabbit, not a child."" He paid for the meals himself because there was no time to fundraise but a local dairy donated milk and Morrisons supermarket donated fruit, he says. ""I've had people who've been walking two and three miles for these meals,"" he says.

Some 3,514,385 Covid-19 vaccinations have taken place in England since 8 December, according to provisional NHS England data. The figure, for jabs up to and including yesterday, includes first and second doses and is a rise of 324,711 on the statistics from 24 hours earlier. Of this number, 3,090,058 were the first dose of the vaccine, a rise of 320,894 on Friday's figures, while 424,327 were the second dose, an increase of 3,817. Pakistan's health minister, Faisal Sultan, says the country has given emergency use authorisation to the Covid-19 vaccine developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca - making it the first to be approved nationally. The Drug
Regulatory Authority of Pakistan (DRAP) is also currently reviewing the Chinese-made Sinopharm vaccine - with more than one million doses already ordered. Mr Sultan told Reuters that the country was speaking to a number of vaccine producers around the world: ""We have and are
watching the evolving stories around efficacy of a number of
vaccines."" Pakistan has confirmed more than 516,000 cases and almost 11,000 deaths so far. Doctors and nurses should be protected from legal action over treatment decisions made under the pressures of the pandemic, medical bodies have said. The British Medical Association (BMA) is among the groups that have written to ministers, saying medical workers should not be at risk of unlawful killing charges. In November, Prime Minister Boris Johnson warned that in the face of the NHS being overwhelmed, ""doctors and nurses could be forced to choose which patients to treat, who would live and who would die"". A joint letter, co-ordinated by the Medical Protection Society (MPS), said - given the current public health emergency - medical staff were concerned ""that not only do they face being put in this position but also that they could subsequently be vulnerable to a criminal investigation by the police"". The letter was signed by the BMA, the Doctors' Association UK, the Hospital Consultants and Specialists' Association, the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh, the British Association of Physicians of Indian Origin and Medical Defence Shield. It calls for emergency legislation to protect doctors and nurses from ""inappropriate"" legal action when dealing with circumstances outside their control. They said the change in the law should be temporary and should apply retrospectively from the start of the pandemic. The government said staff would be protected by indemnity schemes. Read more.

Signal messaging service goes down amid user surgeSignal has been downloaded millions of times since WhatsApp unveiled new privacy terms last week.,"Signal is a free, encrypted messenger service - and a rival to WhatsApp and Telegram Messaging platform Signal says it has resolved technical problems which have hampered its service over the past few days, after seeing a rush of new users. On Friday, some users reported messages failing to send on both the mobile and desktop apps for several hours. The company has seen a huge uptick in interest since its rival WhatsApp unveiled new privacy terms last week. It urged users to continue with the service and report any further problems. In a series of tweets,it said users might see errors in some of their chats,external, including missed messages, but this would not affect their security. ""Signal is back!"" it said. ""Like an underdog going through a training montage, we've learned a lot since yesterday - and we did it together. ""Thanks to the millions of new Signal users around the world for your patience."" Both Signal and Telegram, another free-to-use encrypted messaging app, have benefited from discontent sparked by WhatsApp's updated terms and conditions. The update led many users to believe WhatsApp was telling them that they must allow it to share data with its parent company Facebook if they wished to continue using it. However the platform now says this practice is not new, and there are no changes to it. There are also different privacy laws for users in the UK and Europe - but the notification was sent to everyone. WhatsApp and Facebook to share data outside Europe WhatsApp said there had been ""confusion"" about its message, which initially gave people until 8 February to accept its updated terms or stop using the service. WhatsApp has now changed the cut-off date to 15 May, saying it would use the time to clear up misinformation. ""We can't see your private messages or hear your calls, and neither can Facebook,""WhatsApp said in an earlier FAQ blog post,external. According to data from analytics firm Sensor Tower, Signal was downloaded 246,000 times worldwide in the week before WhatsApp announced the change on 4 January, and 8.8 million times the week after. In India, downloads went from 12,000 to 2.7 million. In the UK, they leapt from 7,400 to 191,000, and in the US from 63,000 to 1.1 million. On Wednesday, Telegram said it had surpassed 500 million active users globally. Downloads jumped from 6.5 million in the week starting 28 December, to 11 million during the following week. During the same period, WhatsApp's global downloads shrank from 11.3 million to 9.2 million. WhatsApp has said the data it shares from users outside the EU and UK does not include messages, groups or call logs. However, it does include: phone number and other information provided on registration (such as name) information about the user's phone, including make, model, and mobile company internet protocol (IP) addresses, which indicate the location of a user's internet connections any payments and financial transactions made over WhatsApp WhatsApp extends 'confusing' update deadline WhatsApp users flock to rival message platforms WhatsApp and Facebook to share data outside Europe At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Man quit after 20 years over furlough 'nightmare' A number of employees have brought successful employment tribunal claims for unauthorised deduction of wages against Clarity, including Mr Steppens. Clarity was ordered to pay him Â£706. A number of other employment tribunal claims are ongoing, according to Community. Joanna Lumley, who had been a supporter of Clarity, called it ""the best of the best"" and said she was ""shocked"" to learn of the allegations over treatment of workers. ""Justice must be done as soon as possible,"" she told BBC News. Clarity was founded in 1854 by a wealthy blind woman, Elizabeth Gilbert, as the Association for Promoting the General Welfare of the Blind, to provide opportunities for workers whom other employers overlooked because of their disabilities. Before the takeover, three-quarters of its staff were disabled people. A factory in London run by General Welfare of the Blind, about 1901 Its supporters and patrons in the past have included Winston Churchill, Charles Dickens and Queen Victoria. Clarity went into administration last year, as it was losing money and unable to fund the hole in its pension scheme, according to a spokesman for the administrators, FRP. In January, it was bought by Nicholas Marks. Sir Iain Duncan Smith, whose London constituency is home to Clarity's headquarters, raised the issue in the House of Commons on 12 January. ""Staff have failed to receive national insurance contributions, with many failing to receive their wages or support while undertaking childcare,"" he told MPs. ""The total amount that these decent but very vulnerable people have failed to receive is now around Â£200,000. They cannot claim benefits because they are essentially employed."" Community estimates that about 60 former employees of Clarity are still awaiting payment of their wages and furlough payments, most of them disabled workers. A spokesman for Nicholas Marks said that Sir Iain's remarks were ""highly inaccurate"" and the company ""does not recognise"" the Â£200,000 figure. ""The grievances echoed by Sir Iain Duncan Smith simply reflect disgruntled ex-employees. All employees currently working have been paid in full up-to-date and the company is dealing with redundancies and gross misconduct of former employees,"" he said. Community says it is not aware of any staff who have been dismissed for gross misconduct. The spokesman for Mr Marks said that Mr Marks had ""saved this historic company from permanent failure"". However, other bids for Clarity were made, including one from the well-known social entrepreneur, Cemal Ezel, who runs the Change Please coffee business, which creates opportunities for homeless people. He is still interested in buying the brands, he told BBC News. Cemal Ezel, founder of Change Please Though Mr Ezel's final bid was slightly higher, the administrators' report says they chose to sell to Mr Marks because he was in a better position to complete the deal by 31 January. Mr Marks's spokesman said that he had to make ""some sensible commercial decisions to place it on to a proper business footing and regrettably some staff had to be let go"". On Wednesday, Clarity's website was still running the Certified Social Enterprise mark, denoting an organisation devoted to ""creating positive social change"". The spokesman said Clarity Products was not a social enterprise and was not ""purporting to clients"" that it was, though it retained the ""social enterprise ethos through the continued employment of fully paid disabled staff"". Wrongly using the logo for nearly a year was ""simply an oversight"", and it is being removed. On Thursday morning, the website was unavailable - the company spokesman said he was not aware why. In a response to Sir Iain's query, Treasury Minister Jesse Norman wrote that he had ""specifically asked HMRC to note the circumstances you describe, and to consider whether and how there may be a case for early intervention"". Another company owned by Mr Marks, a Preston-based caravan maker called Lunar Automotive, was reported to HMRC by the local MP, Sir Mark Hendrick, for allegedly refusing to pay wages and pension contributions for its workers. This company was also bought out of an administration run by FRP. Mr Marks's spokesman was not able to comment in detail on the Lunar Automotive case, but said the company had not heard back from HMRC.

Hauliers 'bypassing Welsh ports because of Brexit'Sea port managers fear the shift may be part of a long-term trend to ship from the Irish Republic.Wales,"Irish hauliers have been bypassing ports in Wales because of Brexit, say industry leaders Irish hauliers are bypassing Welsh ports to avoid Brexit bureaucracy, industry leaders say. So-called ""teething problems"" with new export rules are causing ""enormous strain on staff"", according to one haulage company. But others warn of a longer-term shift by truck firms from using Holyhead, Fishguard and Pembroke Dock. Gwynedd Shipping said it was operating at 65% normal volumes and the pressure of extra paperwork was challenging. Andrew Kinsella, the firm's managing director, said: ""It's an enormous strain on our staff in terms of processing bookings. Covid tests for Channel hauliers to continue 'until further notice' 'Most difficult week I've had in this job in 20 years' Truckers who tested negative board ferries for France ""We process around 400 or 500 bookings a week, the reality is we're operating at 65-70% of previous volumes. ""Whilst we see recovery in the number of clients and we're starting to get to a better pattern in terms of shipments I still think it's going to take several weeks for things to return to normal. Whether things return to pre-Christmas, pre-Brexit volumes remains to be seen."" Mr Kinsella thinks there will be long-term consequences for the ports. Stena Line is among firms that have made changes to the routes its uses ""You can already see the shift in terms of the number of sailings,"" he said. ""I think you're seeing a shift away from Holyhead particularly in terms of weekend, off-peak traffic. I think longer term, the viability of all of these services will be something those ferry services will continue to scrutinise."" This week Stena Line moved its new ship to the route from Rosslare, in the Republic of Ireland, to Cherbourg, France. According to Irish public broadcaster RTÃ, a new weekend sailing from Dublin to Cherbourg will also begin on 23 January, resulting in a temporary reduction in weekend capacity on the Dublin to Holyhead route.  It also intends to sail the Belfast-to-Liverpool route. ""Due to the current Brexit-related shift for direct routes and increasing customer demand, Stena Line has decided to temporarily deploy the Stena Embla on Rosslare-Cherbourg,"" Stena Line said. At Rosslare Europort, business is booming, says general manager Glenn Carr. ""We've seen unprecedented demand in the first two weeks of trading compared to last year,"" Mr Carr said. ""On our European routes there's a 500% increase in freight volume going through the port compared to last year."" He added that 18 months ago they would have had three sailings a week directly to mainland Europe from Rosslare Europort: ""Today we have 15."" Mr Carr says his customers want to bypass the UK because of Brexit. ""I think that's testament to demand, particularly from our exporters and importers, on the island of Ireland and the need to unfortunately bypass the UK because of Brexit to trade directly with the EU,"" he added. He believes this change in operations will not be temporary. He said decisions by ferry companies and businesses who trade with the EU to re-direct freight, have been made based on market analysis. ""The business case for the extra services out of Rosslare were not based on the first two weeks of this year,"" Mr Carr said. ""They were based on analysis of the market and conversations with our exporters and importers who were switching. ""So there is a genuine switch and we foresee services being maintained out of Rosslare."" UK government ministers have played down concerns about the long term viability of Welsh ports. Giving evidence to the Welsh Affairs Select Committee this week, Wales Office Minister David TC Davies MP, said former haulage industry colleagues referred to the issues as ""teething problems"". Secretary of State for Wales Simon Hart MP, said: ""There is some evidence that things aren't looking necessarily, permanently bleak. ""It's one of those areas where we have to keep a very wary eye on it, but I think and hope that it is a temporary dip in the graph."" But transport expert Prof Stuart Cole, of the University of South Wales, thinks Brexit delays will be the incentive Irish companies needed to switch permanently to trading directly with the European mainland. Prof Cole said the EU wanted to reduce congestion and pollution in parts of Europe. One solution was to move freight by sea rather than road. There have been problems with paperwork for drivers travelling to the European mainland Until now there was no reason for Irish hauliers to move from using Welsh ports and Dover, Prof Cole said. ""The route worked perfectly, there was a predictable journey time and that's important for food and component parts going to factories,"" he said. ""That kind of change required a significant shift, and that's what's there now."" Bangor University economics lecturer, Dr Edward Thomas Jones, believes it is too soon to predict longer term changes. ""Because businesses stockpiled before Christmas in anticipation of Brexit, there is of course less use of the port [at Holyhead] since Brexit,"" he said. ""On top of that, coronavirus means there are fewer tourists going on holiday to Ireland. ""We'll have a better idea of the future of the port in six months when these businesses who have stockpiled start buying again. ""Hopefully, by the second half of the year coronavirus will have been resolved and tourists will once again be able to travel back and forth."" Plaid Cymru warned if traffic continued to be diverted away from the UK then Wales would suffer. ""I urge the UK government to work with the Welsh Government to provide substantial investment into Welsh ports to secure their viability into the future,"" said MP Hywel Williams, Plaid's Cabinet Office spokesman. ""If the trend of rerouting traffic through direct routes continues, I fear that our local economies both in the north west and south west of Wales will suffer enormously.""

New takeaway and shopping rules begin in ScotlandTakeaway outlets and click and collect retail services must change how they operate in Scotland.,"New tighter Covid restrictions have come into force in Scotland with changes for takeaway outlets and click and collect shopping. Customers buying takeaway food and coffee are no longer allowed inside premises. Staff must serve from a hatch or doorway. Now only retailers selling essential items - clothing, footwear, baby equipment, homeware and books - can provide click and collect services. Customer collections can only be made outdoors, with staggered pick-up times to avoid queues. The changes are amongsix new rulesannounced by First Minister Nicola Sturgeon earlier this week. 1. Takeaway food and drinks 2. Click and collect shopping services 3. Outdoor alcohol consumption 4. Working from home 5. Home repairs and maintenance 6. Stay at Home message Ms Sturgeon said they were a ""regrettable but necessary means to an end"". The restrictions also include a ban on drinking alcohol outside in public in level four areas. This prevents takeaway pints from being consumed in parks or on the street. Statutory guidance has also been introduced requiring employers to support staff working from home wherever possible. Guidance on tradespeople working in homes has now been put into law. Work is only permitted for essential maintenance and repairs. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon announced the new rules to the Scottish parliament on Wednesday. The final new rule changes an ""apparent loophole"" in the stay at home regulations. The law now states that people must not leave ""or remain"" outside unless it is for an essential purpose. The tightened restrictions come amid concerns that the stay at home message across the UK isnot having the same impactit did during last year's lockdown. ""The situation we face in relation to the virus remains extremely serious,"" Ms Sturgeon told parliament. ""These additional measures, in further reducing the interactions that allow the virus to spread, will help our essential efforts to suppress it, "" she added.

Signal messaging service goes down amid user surgeSignal has been downloaded millions of times since WhatsApp unveiled new privacy terms last week.Technology,"Signal is a free, encrypted messenger service - and a rival to WhatsApp and Telegram Messaging platform Signal says it has resolved technical problems which have hampered its service over the past few days, after seeing a rush of new users. On Friday, some users reported messages failing to send on both the mobile and desktop apps for several hours. The company has seen a huge uptick in interest since its rival WhatsApp unveiled new privacy terms last week. It urged users to continue with the service and report any further problems. In a series of tweets,it said users might see errors in some of their chats,external, including missed messages, but this would not affect their security. ""Signal is back!"" it said. ""Like an underdog going through a training montage, we've learned a lot since yesterday - and we did it together. ""Thanks to the millions of new Signal users around the world for your patience."" Both Signal and Telegram, another free-to-use encrypted messaging app, have benefited from discontent sparked by WhatsApp's updated terms and conditions. The update led many users to believe WhatsApp was telling them that they must allow it to share data with its parent company Facebook if they wished to continue using it. However the platform now says this practice is not new, and there are no changes to it. There are also different privacy laws for users in the UK and Europe - but the notification was sent to everyone. WhatsApp and Facebook to share data outside Europe WhatsApp said there had been ""confusion"" about its message, which initially gave people until 8 February to accept its updated terms or stop using the service. WhatsApp has now changed the cut-off date to 15 May, saying it would use the time to clear up misinformation. ""We can't see your private messages or hear your calls, and neither can Facebook,""WhatsApp said in an earlier FAQ blog post,external. According to data from analytics firm Sensor Tower, Signal was downloaded 246,000 times worldwide in the week before WhatsApp announced the change on 4 January, and 8.8 million times the week after. In India, downloads went from 12,000 to 2.7 million. In the UK, they leapt from 7,400 to 191,000, and in the US from 63,000 to 1.1 million. On Wednesday, Telegram said it had surpassed 500 million active users globally. Downloads jumped from 6.5 million in the week starting 28 December, to 11 million during the following week. During the same period, WhatsApp's global downloads shrank from 11.3 million to 9.2 million. WhatsApp has said the data it shares from users outside the EU and UK does not include messages, groups or call logs. However, it does include: phone number and other information provided on registration (such as name) information about the user's phone, including make, model, and mobile company internet protocol (IP) addresses, which indicate the location of a user's internet connections any payments and financial transactions made over WhatsApp WhatsApp extends 'confusing' update deadline WhatsApp users flock to rival message platforms WhatsApp and Facebook to share data outside Europe At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

UK to close all travel corridors from Monday,"This video can not be played Prime Minister Boris Johnson: ""We will temporarily close all travel corridors from 0400 on Monday"" The UK is to close all travel corridors from Monday morning to ""protect against the risk of as yet unidentified new strains"" of Covid, the PM has said. Anyone flying into the country from overseas will have to show proof of a negative Covid test before setting off. It comes as aban on travellers from South America and Portugalcame into force on Friday over concerns about a new variant identified in Brazil. Boris Johnson said the new rules would be in place until at least 15 February. A further 1,280 people with coronavirus have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive test, taking the total to 87,291. The latest government figures on Friday,externalalso showed another 55,761 new cases had been reported - up from 48,682 the previous day. Meanwhile, more than two million people around the world have now died with the virus since the pandemic began,according to figures from Johns Hopkins University.,external What are the new rules for travellers? Why hasn't the UK banned all international flights? Scotland to suspend travel corridors from Monday Speaking at a Downing Street press conference, the prime minister said it was ""vital"" to take extra measures now ""when day by day we are making such strides in protecting the population"". ""It's precisely because we have the hope of that vaccine and the risk of new strains coming from overseas that we must take additional steps now to stop those strains from entering the country."" All travel corridors will close from 04:00 GMT on Monday.,externalAfter that, arrivals to the UK will need to quarantine for up to 10 days, unless they test negative after five days. Mr Johnson, who said the rules would apply across the UK after talks with the devolved administrations, added that the government would be stepping up enforcement at the border and in the country. Travel corridors were introduced in the summer to allow people travelling from some countries with low numbers of Covid cases to come to the UK without having to quarantine on arrival. Trade body Airlines UK said it supported the latest restrictions ""on the assumption"" that the government would remove them ""when it is safe to do so"". Chief executive Tim Alderslade said travel corridors were ""a lifeline for the industry"" last summer but ""things change and there's no doubting this is a serious health emergency"". Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said it was the ""right step"" but called the timing of the decision ""slow again"", adding that the public would be thinking ""why on earth didn't this happen before"". The prime minister warned that the NHS was facing ""extraordinary pressures"", having had the highest number of hospital admissions on a single day of the pandemic earlier this week. He said that came on Tuesday when there were 4,134 new admissions, while the UK currently has more than 37,000 Covid patients in hospitals. Mr Johnson said that once the most vulnerable have been vaccinated by mid-February ""we will think about what steps we could take to lift the restrictions"". England is currently under a national lockdown, meaning people must stay at home and can go out only for limited reasons such as food shopping, exercise, or work if they cannot do so from home. Similar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Also speaking at the No 10 briefing, England's chief medical officer Prof Chris Whitty said the restrictions would need to be lifted gradually by ""testing what works, and then if that works going the next step"". He said the peak of people entering hospital would be in the next week to 10 days for most places, but ""we hope"" the peak of infections ""already has happened"" in the south-east, east and London. ""The peak of deaths I fear is in the future, the peak of hospitalisations in some parts of the country may be around about now and beginning to come off the very, very top,"" he said. A ban on travellers from South America, Portugal and Cape Verde entering the UKcame into force on Friday morningas a result of a new, potentially more infectious variant of coronavirus linked to Brazil. The government's chief scientific adviser Sir Patrick Vallance told the press briefing that some of the new variants may be able to ""get round"" the Covid vaccines but it was ""really quite easy"" to adjust the vaccines to deal with mutations in the virus. New variants causing concern have previously been identifiedin the UKandSouth Africa, with many countries imposing restrictions on arrivals from both nations. Public Health England said a total of 35 genomically confirmed and 12 genomically probable cases of the Covid-19 variant which originated in South Africa have been identified in the UK as of 14 January. Earlier, a leading scientist said one of the two variants first detected in Brazil had been found in the UK -but not the variant that was causing concern. ""I think it is likely that the vaccine we have now is going to protect against the UK variant and is going to provide protection I suspect against the other variants as well,"" said Sir Patrick. ""The question is to what degree."" How worrying are the new Covid variants? Latest figures show that more than three million people in the UK have now received the first dose of a vaccine - 3,234,946 - an increase of 316,694 from the previous day. Sir Patrick said he expected the vaccines would reduce transmission of the virus but that ""we shouldn't go mad"" as jabs are rolled out because a risk would remain. ""Just because you've been vaccinated doesn't mean you can't catch this and pass it on, it means you're protected against severe disease,"" he added. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

But in London, where tight restrictions came in earlier, the R number is lower - between 0.9 and 1.2.

CDC predicts 'rapid growth' of virus variant in US,"The US is in a race to vaccinate its population amid a winter surge A highly contagious coronavirus variant first detected in the UK could become the dominant strain in the US by March, health officials have said. The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned of ""rapid growth"" of the variant in coming weeks. It said such a spike could further threaten health systems already strained by a winter Covid surge. The warning came on Friday as President-elect Joe Biden unveiled an ambitious plan to ramp up vaccinations. To meet his target of inoculating 100 million Americans within his first 100 days in office, Mr Biden said his administration would take a more active role in accelerating the distribution of vaccines. He outlined a plan to set up new mass vaccination centres, hire extra health workers, and ensure the shot is available to everyone, including minority communities that have been hit hardest by the epidemic. How will the world vaccinate seven billion people? Covid map: Where have the two million deaths been? Official data shows that, so far, 12.2 million vaccine doses of have been administered in the US,external- a figure Mr Biden has criticised as insufficient. More than 30 million doses have been distributed to states. In a speech on Friday, Mr Biden told Americans that ""we remain in a very dark winter"", admitting that ""things will get worse before they get better"". ""This is going to be one of the most challenging operational efforts ever undertaken by our country,"" Mr Biden, who takes office on 20 January, said of the vaccination drive. His address came a day afterhe announced a $1.9tn (Â£1.4tn) stimulus packagefor the battered US economy that included a further $20bn for the vaccine roll-out. The plan will need to pass Congress. This video can not be played Biden: ""I promise we will not forget you"" The US has recorded the highest number of confirmed coronavirus infections - 23.5 million - of any country in the world. At about 391,000, the country's coronavirus deaths account for a fifth of the global total, which passed the two-million mark on Friday. The crisis is particularly acute in the state of California, where deaths have surged by more than 1,000% since November. Inside California's struggle to contain the virus In its report,external, the CDC said that the UK variant would spread quickly in the coming weeks. The latest research by Public Health England (PHE),externalsuggests the variant - now dominant in much of Britain - is between 30% and 50% more transmissible than previous strains. There is currently no evidence to suggest it causes any more serious illness. Experts have also played down the possibility that the current vaccines will not be as effective against it. How worrying are the new coronavirus variants? So far, 76 people from 10 US states have been confirmed to have been infected with the UK variant, known as B.1.1.7. But the CDC said: ""The modelled trajectory of this variant in the US exhibits rapid growth in early 2021, becoming the predominant variant in March."" Two other variants - one from South Africa and one from Brazil - are also thought to be more contagious than the original one that started the pandemic.

NÃ³ra Quoirin inquest 'leaves unanswered questions',"NÃ³ra Quoirin went missing from her room on 4 August 2019 An inquest into the death of a teenager who went missing during a holiday in Malaysia has left several questions unanswered, her family has said. NÃ³ra Quoirin, whose mother is from Belfast, disappeared from her room at the Dusun resort on 4 August 2019. Her body was found 10 days later about 1.6 miles (2.5km) away. Earlier this month a coroner ruled that she died as a result of misadventure, buther family said they were ""utterly disappointed"" with the verdict. In an interview with Irish broadcaster RTÃ, NÃ³ra's mother Meabh said there is ""compelling evidence"" that her daughter was abducted. Search and rescue teams were deployed in an effort to locate NÃ³ra NÃ³ra, who was born to Irish-French parents, lived with her family in London and was understood to be in Malaysia on an Irish passport. She was born with holoprosencephaly, a disorder which affects brain development. Since her disappearance, her parents have believed that she was abducted. They have always maintained that wandering off was not something they could imagine their daughter doing. The girl who vanished into a Malaysian jungle Parents want answers after teen death case closed 'No foul play' in Nora Quoirin death Meabh Quoirin told RTÃ: ""One of the most compelling things that we found out was that in a relatively small area, the plantation where NÃ³ra was eventually found, there was vast numbers of specialist personnel deployed to find NÃ³ra. ""Not only that, on four different occasions, trained personnel went to the plantation area and searched it and, in fact, some officers were even in the precise location NÃ³ra's body was recovered. ""They had all reported that there were no signs of human life at any point. That for us is compelling evidence to say that she was not there by herself."" NÃ³ra went missing the day after she and her family arrived in Malaysia in August 2019 Mrs Quoirin added that ""there was a lack of evidence around DNA and prints"". She said that when the family went to the inquest, ""we had a lot of unanswered questions and while many of those questions cannot be answered, we actually found out a great deal about what went on during those 10 days when NÃ³ra was missing"". Meabh and Sebastien Quorin, pictured during the search for NÃ³ra ""In fact we felt it really strengthened our case, our belief, that NÃ³ra was abducted and we found some compelling evidence to support our view on that."" Mrs Quoirin added that her daughter ""was not physically or mentally capable"" of leaving the chalet via the window. ""Not only that - we also learned that none of her fingerprints could be found on the window and yet other unidentifiable prints were found on that window.""
