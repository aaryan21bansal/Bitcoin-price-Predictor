M&S customer 'racially harassed by staff member',"Essex Police was called to the M&S branch at Mayflower Retail Park in Basildon Marks & Spencer says it is looking into an allegation that one of its shop workers racially harassed a customer. Faryaal Hussain said two female members of staff followed her into a car park in Basildon, and one subjected her to racial abuse. The mother-of-two said it happened after a dispute inside the store about where to queue for the tills. Essex Police confirmed it was investigating, and M&S said it took all allegations ""extremely seriously"". Officers were called to Mayflower Retail Park at about 13:00 BST on Friday 7 August to deal with a report that a woman in her 30s had been harassed. Mrs Hussain said she and her mother were waiting for a till when they were approached by a member of staff who told them, ""the queue's over there, can you not read?"" She asked for the worker's name and said she was going to speak to the manager. Later, as she was putting her trolley away in the car park, she said the same staff member approached her again, with a colleague, who used an offensive term and said: ""People like you can't read."" Mrs Hussain said: ""As we were walking to our car, they were also walking with us. They were both going on and on. ""I'm shocked and hurt that in the 21st Century people still have this mentality. ""I moved to Essex from London less than two years ago for a quieter life to raise my children, but since I've been here I've had the most racial discrimination, and it makes me wonder if it's because I wear a headscarf."" Essex Police appealed for witnesses to come forward, and said a man and a woman were believed to have seen the incident. M&S said in a statement: ""We take all allegations extremely seriously and we are currently investigating the situation.""

Robot boat completes three-week Atlantic mission,"The robot boat was controlled via satellite from SEA-KIT's HQ in Tollesbury in Essex A UK boat has just provided an impressive demonstration of the future of robotic maritime operations. The 12m Uncrewed Surface Vessel (USV) Maxlimer has completed a 22-day-long mission to map an area of seafloor in the Atlantic. SEA-KIT International, which developed the craft, ""skippered"" the entire outing via satellite from its base in Tollesbury in eastern England. The mission was part-funded by the European Space Agency. Robot boats promise a dramatic change in the way we work at sea. Already, many of the big survey companies that run traditional crewed vessels have started to invest heavily in the new, remotely operated technologies. Freight companies are also acknowledging the cost advantages that will come from running robot ships. But ""over-the-horizon"" control has to show it's practical and safe if it's to gain wide acceptance. Hence, the demonstration from Maxlimer. Robots go their own way deep in the ocean One-fifth of Earth's ocean floor is now mapped Ocean survey company goes for robot boats at scale The boat mapped a section of seafloor on the edge of the continental shelf The USV was despatched from Plymouth in late July and sent to a location some 460km (280 miles) to the south-west. With a multi-beam echo-sounder attached to its hull, the boat mapped more than 1,000sq km of continental shelf area, down to about a kilometre in depth. This was a segment of seafloor that had essentially no modern data registered with the UK Hydrographic Office. SEA-KIT had wanted to send the USV across the Atlantic to America for the demonstration, but the Covid-19 crisis made this impossible to organise. ""The project's overall aim was to demonstrate the capabilities of current technologies to survey unexplored or inadequately surveyed ocean frontiers and despite the planning challenges we faced due to Covid-19, I feel that we have done that. We have proven the true over-the-horizon capability of our USV design and the team are exhausted but elated,"" the company's director of technology, Peter Walker, said. The USV Maxlimer was originally developed for -and won- the Shell Ocean Discovery XPRIZE. This was a competition to find the next-generation technologies that could be used to map the global ocean floor.Four-fifths of the sea bottom have yet to be surveyedto an acceptable resolution. Robotic solutions will be essential if we're to have any chance of closing the knowledge gap. Artwork: The Netherlands-headquartered multinational Fugro has ordered a fleet of USVs from SEA-KIT Maxlimer makes use of a communications and control system known as Global Situational Awareness via Internet. This allows an operator to remotely access CCTV footage, thermal imaging and radar through the vessel, as well as listen live to the USV's surroundings and even communicate with others in the vicinity. Maxlimer links to three independent satellite systems to stay in contact with the control room in Tollesbury. The robot boat moves slowly, at up to 4 knots (7km/h; 5mph), but its hybrid diesel-electric propulsion system is highly efficient. SEA-KIT CEO and designer, Ben Simpson, told BBC News: ""We had a sweepstake on how much fuel would be left in the tank. We thought there was going to be 300-400 litres. It turned out there was 1,300 litres."" In other words, Maxlimer returned to Plymouth with its fuel tank still around a third full. As well as the European Space Agency, partners on the project included Global Marine Group, Map the Gaps, Teledyne CARIS, Woods Hole Group and the Nippon Foundation-GEBCO Seabed 2030 initiative. Another partner was Fugro, one of the world's biggest marine geotechnical companies. The multinational recently announced a contract with SEA-KIT to purchase a fleet of USVs to use in survey work in the oil, gas and offshore wind sectors.

'Frantic packing' and trips 'ruined' by quarantine,"Thousands of holidaymakers have seen their plans thrown into chaos afterUK quarantine measures were alteredto include France and the Netherlands from Saturday morning. Here are some of their tales. Scott and Tracy Cuthbert have been on holiday in France with their daughter Milly ScottandTracy Cuthbert, from the village of Bloxham in Oxfordshire, say cutting their holiday in the Loire Valley short by six days was an ""easy decision to make for us because we both need to work"". Scott, a sales manager for a glazing company, was furloughed for 10 weeks but business has been going well since he returned to work - so he can't afford to miss out. And Tracy wants to make sure she's back for the start of term for the private school she works at. The couple and their daughter Milly, 16, should have been coming back next Thursday, but began ""frantically packing"" and searching for a ferry to bring them home in time after they heard news of the rule changes. They had been on holiday with three other families who are also all coming home early. ""It's ruined everyone's holiday and cut it short,"" Scott says. ""Why 14-day quarantine when parts of the UK are probably more badly affected? I am very frustrated."" The family booked themselves onto a ferry for Friday afternoon, only to realise they wouldn't make it to the port in time - so have now booked another ferry, due to leave Calais at 20:30 BST. ""We're driving up now and the sat nav says we'll have about an hour's leeway,"" Scott says from the car. Milly is already worrying about her GCSE results after the news about people being downgraded for A-levels - and is now concerned she could miss the first day back at school if the family have to self-isolate, her father adds. What are the UK travel quarantine rules? The Cuthbert family and the friends they were holidaying with all had to pack up quickly this morning Katieis a teacher in London on holiday in a remote part of France, in a private villa. She says she and her children will miss the beginning of the school term because they are a 12-hour drive to the Channel crossing ""so we can't make it back in time"". Katie says she checked the government website and signed up for any alerts to keep an eye on changes to the rules. ""We knew there may be a risk but also we couldn't get a refund on our holiday,"" she says. ""Why did they not give this call at the beginning of the week so we could have travelled back? Why were they still advising it was OK to travel to France?"" ""We have done everything the government has asked of us for months but I really think they need to treat us all with a little respect and give us time to organize ourselves."" I'm in France right now - what do I do? European countries fight coronavirus surge France to be added to UK quarantine countries Laurence Dolman with his nine-year-old son Henry, and daughters Bethan, seven, and Eliza, three Laurence Dolmanand his family, from Sheffield, have enjoyed a week of ice creams and sunshine at a Eurocamp in Wassenaar, in the Netherlands. Their ferry home will arrive in Hull at 08:30 on Saturday - four hours after the rules come into effect. Before the pandemic the family had spent about a year and a half planning a big trip around Europe for this summer, and they've lost a lot of money since it was cancelled. So they decided to treat themselves to a smaller summer holiday, and carefully picked the Netherlands as what they thought was a ""low-risk"" place to visit compared with other European countries. While Laurence, 41, and his wife Michelle, 40, have discussed ""crazy ideas"" about possibly being let off the self-isolation rules, due to ""possibly being in British naval territory"" by the cut-off time of 04:00, they have ""no regrets"" about having to quarantine. ""We deserved this holiday,"" Laurence says, citing how difficult it has been home-schooling his children during lockdown. This video can not be played British holiday maker at Calais: ""We cancelled our holiday to come home"" Asked if they considered trying to get home early, he adds: ""No, we're just going to soak up our last bit of holiday."" ""My wife and I have another week's leave before we are due to return to work. I'm fortunate that I'm able to work from home but as my wife is a social worker, it's a bit more of a problem for her"". Karl Simpson isn't rushing back from his holiday in south-east France Karl Simpsonwent to his second home in the French hamlet of Vion knowing ""full well"" he might have to quarantine on his return home to Southampton on 20 August. But now that it's been confirmed, he is worried about arranging care for his 90-year-old mother, who has dementia. ""There is no time now to rearrange care provision if I am absent,"" he says. ""Will the government help? Will I be breaking quarantine rules if I visit Mum, or do the [previous lockdown exemptions for carers] still apply? I've arranged care for the time I'm away but sustaining that care beyond the 20th will be difficult."" Karl, a 68-year-old scientist who has advised the government on vaccines and pandemic planning, is hoping the same exemptions for carers will be in place as when the UK was in full lockdown in March - but ""there's no clear guidance on that yet"". He says he agrees with the principle of quarantining after a foreign holiday, ""but it should be applied intelligently"". You finally got abroad, but was it worth it? Sun, sea and sanitiser: What your holiday will be like Tom Duffell, who runs a small business, decided to cut short his family holiday to Nice by four days and booked a last minute flight home. ""An extra two weeks off of work is just not doable,"" says Tom ""We were enjoying a nice cocktail last night and suddenly a news flash pops in and a scramble to book flights,"" he told the BBC from the airport. ""I think we've managed to get my wife and one of my sons on one flight and myself and my other son on another flight. ""We've had to spend about Â£800 because we just can't afford to take two extra weeks off of work,"" added Tom, whose wife works as an NHS nurse and volunteered in an intensive care ward. He said the government should have given tourists already in France longer to prepare. ""They could have said you know give tourists 72 hours to return to the UK, rather than just over 24 hours and there's this mad scramble,"" he said. ""Instead we're all packed into the airport. There's huge queues, social distancing's gone out of the window."" ""We're all scrambling on to the same flight, the flights are all full. Surely that's not going to help public health, that's just going to make things worse."" Will you be affected by the quarantine? Do you have a story to share? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

UK commemorates 75th anniversary of VJ Day,"This video can not be played A service of remembrance was held at the National Memorial Arboretum The Royal Family has led the UK's commemorations on the 75th anniversary of VJ Day - the day World War Two ended with Japan's surrender. The Prince of Wales led a two-minute silence at the National Memorial Arboretum in Staffordshire, as part of a service of remembrance. Later, in a TV address, his elder son Prince William urged the public ""to learn the lessons of the past"". And a message from the Queen thanked those ""who fought so valiantly"". She said: ""Those of us who remember the conclusion of the Far East campaign, whether on active service overseas, or waiting for news at home, will never forget the jubilant scenes and overwhelming sense of relief."" The Prince of Wales attended the event at the arboretum with the Duchess of Cornwall. He laid a wreath at the Kwai Railway Memorial, as a small number of veterans and their relatives sat on benches dotted around the garden, to maintain social distancing. A Battle of Britain Memorial Flight flypast also commemorated those who fought. In a speech, Prince Charles said the veterans' service ""will echo through the ages."" He referred to the description of them as the Forgotten Army, noting how many soldiers, nurses and other personnel felt aggrieved at the way some of the public associated the end of World War Two with the victory in Europe in May 1945. ""Let us affirm, they and serving veterans are not forgotten, rather you are respected, thanked and cherished with all our hearts and for all time,"" he said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who also attended and read the poem The Exhortation before the silence, thanked those who had fought for restoring ""peace and prosperity"". Boris Johnson laid a wreath and read the war poem Exhortation - saying ""they shall grow not old"" This video can not be played Prince William: ""Your bravery, and the sacrifices you made, will never be forgotten"" In a pre-recorded speech for BBC One's VJ Day 75: The Nation's Tribute - broadcast on Saturday evening - the Duke of Cambridge spoke of how King George VI addressed the nation on August 15 1945 as ""the most catastrophic conflict in mankind's history came to an end"". ""It is hard for us to imagine what Victory over Japan Day must have felt like at the time; a mix of happiness, jubilation, and sheer relief, together with a deep sadness and overwhelming sense of loss for those who would never return home. ""Today we remember those who endured terrible suffering and honour all those who lost their lives."" He cautioned: ""As we look back, we must not forget our responsibility to learn the lessons of the past and ensure that the horrors of the Second World War are never repeated. ""We owe that to our veterans, to their families, and to the generations who will come after us. He went on to thank those veterans, among them his own grandfather, the Duke of Edinburgh, who ""remembers vividly his role in collecting released prisoners of war"", said Prince William. Prince Philip was a young Royal Navy officer aboard a warship in Tokyo Bay when Japan surrendered. As part of the commemorations, he appeared in a photo montage of veterans which featured on large screens in locations across the country throughout the day. In the montage each veteran was pictured with an image of themselves from their time in service. It marked a rare appearance for Prince Philip, 99, who has only been seen a handful of times in public since retiring in 2017 - most recently for a military event at Windsor Castle. Earlier in the morning, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace was joined by military chiefs as he placed a wreath at the Cenotaph in London. The defence secretary also met some of the famous Chelsea Pensioners during his visit to their iconic home, the Royal Hospital Chelsea, as part of events to mark the 75th anniversary. But the Red Arrows - who were due to carry out a flypast over the capital cities of all four nations of the UK - were forced to cancel flights over Edinburgh, Cardiff and London, where they were to fly directly over the Royal Hospital Chelsea, due to poor weather conditions. They were, at least, able to fly over Belfast, and pilots met three veterans during a stop at Prestwick, near Glasgow. The Red Arrows flew over the Titanic slipway and the Titanic Museum in Belfast VJ Day - or Victory over Japan Day - on 15 August 1945 ended one of the worst episodes in British military history, during which tens of thousands of servicemen were forced to endure the brutalities of prisoner of war camps. It is estimated that there were 71,000 British and Commonwealth casualties of the war against Japan, including more than 12,000 prisoners of war who died in Japanese captivity. More than 2.5 million Japanese military personnel and civilians are believed to have died over the course of the conflict. What is VJ Day? VJ Day celebrations 75 years ago Bells toll to mark 75 years since Hiroshima bomb The fighting in Europe had ended in May 1945, but many Allied servicemen were still fighting against Japan in east Asia. Japan rejected an ultimatum for peace, and the US believed that dropping a nuclear bomb would force them to surrender. The US dropped two atomic bombs on Japan on 6 and 9 August, killing an estimated 214,000 people, and within two weeks Japan surrendered. To mark the 75th anniversary,Japan's Prime Minister Shinzo Abe sent an offeringto a controversial war shrine in Tokyo, but did not attend in person. However, two of his ministers did visit the Yasukuni Shrine, in which 14 leaders who were later convicted by the Allies as war criminals are commemorated. John Maguire, BBC News The National Memorial Arboretum seems to lend itself perfectly to the concept of a socially distanced commemorative service. Veterans of the Burma campaign, their families, and other guests sat on chairs spaced out on the grass between the trees. The proceedings focused on the multinational and multicultural make up of the Allied forces that fought the Japanese. Gurkhas, alongside Sikhs, sat next to troops from Welsh and Scottish regiments, representing the 40 nations involved in the Far East. After sitar music, readings from British Asian actors, and speeches from descendants of those who fought, the roar of aircraft engines could be heard overhead. A Lancaster, Hurricane and three Spitfires from the Battle of Britain Memorial flew over in formation and in tribute. Then those who could stand, were invited to do so for a two-minute silence. The Prince of Wales then laid a wreath at the Burma Railway Memorial. Flowers had been placed between the sleepers and track that make up the memorial. It was known as the ""Death Railway"" and 16,000 prisoners of war died during its construction. It makes an incongruous, yet incredibly poignant sight among the granite and brass of the other memorials. Boris Johnson earlier joined other world leaders including US President Donald Trump in recording a video message to thank veterans. In the video, each leader says in turn: ""To all who served, we thank you."" Defence Secretary Ben Wallace (far right) laid a wreath at the Cenotaph in London on Saturday morning Mr Johnson added: ""On this 75th anniversary of the end of the Second World War, we pay tribute to the heroes deployed thousands of miles away in the mountains, islands and rainforests of Asia. ""Unable to celebrate the victory in Europe, and among the last to return home, today we recognise the bravery and ingenuity of those who, in the face of adversity, restored peace and prosperity to the world. ""Their immeasurable sacrifice changed the course of history and, at today's commemorations, we take the opportunity to say what should be said every day - thank you."" How a Belfast doctor used Irish to keep WW2 secrets A WW2 hero and a reckoning with Japan's past Daughter of WW2 prisoner of war shares last letter In a letter specifically addressed to Far East veterans, Mr Johnson said: ""You were the last to come home but your achievements are written in the lights of the glittering capitals of the dynamic region we see today."" ""All of us who were born after you have benefitted from your courage in adversity. On this anniversary, and every day hereafter, you will be remembered,"" he added. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer also recorded a message, paying tribute ""to the wartime generation, who through the horrors of conflict showed us the spirit and determination that we need to always remember and always be grateful for"". ""It's important that as we face the challenges of today, we take inspiration from that generation,"" he said. At the 70th anniversary of VJ Day there was a parade in London Meanwhile Capt Sir Tom Moore, who served in the Burma campaign has encouraged the public to join in the commemorations, describing VJ Day as ""the most special day"". ""It was VJ Day when the pain of war could finally start to fall away as peace was declared on all fronts,"" said Sir Tom - who raised millions of pounds for NHS charities by walking laps of his garden during lockdown. ""I respectfully ask Britain to stop whatever it is doing and take some time to remember. ""We must all take the time to stop, think and be thankful that were it not for the ultimate sacrifices made all those years ago by such a brave band of men and women, we would not be enjoying the freedoms we have today, even in these current difficult times."" The service at the National Memorial Arboretum was broadcast on BBC One between 09:30 and 11:30 BST and is available on Iplayer. VJ Day 75: The Nation's Tribute is broadcast from 20:30 BST.

Exiled leader calls weekend of protests in Belarus,"This video can not be played 'Human life is the most precious thing': Svetlana Tikhanovskaya speaks out from exile Belarus opposition leader Svetlana Tikhanovskaya has called for peaceful rallies across the country, after she was forced to leave for Lithuania in the wake of a disputed election. ""Don't stay on the sidelines,"" she said, proposing a broad council to work on the transfer of power. Alexander Lukashenko has ruled Belarus since 1994 but Sunday's presidential vote was condemned by the EU and US. Protests have erupted across the country calling for him to quit. Some 6,700 people were arrested in the wake of the election, and many have spoken of torture at the hands of the security services. As protests continued for a sixth day and walkouts from state factories grew on Friday, EU foreign ministers held an emergency video meeting and agreed to prepare new sanctions on Belarusian officials responsible ""for violence and falsification"". These workers at the Azot company in Grodno joined a protest on Friday Amnesty International said accounts from released detainees suggested ""widespread torture"". Russia on Friday said Belarus had handed back 32 suspected mercenaries who had been detained since last month. Authorities in Belarus said the men were in the country to destabilise Sunday's election, while Russia said they were just passing through. Details of their release are not yet clear. Ms Tikhanovskaya was held for seven hours herself on Monday night, when she went to register a complaint about the election, before she was forced into exile. Protesters marched past the KGB security service building on Friday chanting ""let them go"" The Central Election Commission says Mr Lukashenko won 80.1% of the vote and Ms Tikhanovskaya 10.12%. But Ms Tikhanovskaya insists that where votes were properly counted, she won support ranging from 60% to 70%. She has called on mayors to organise ""peaceful mass gatherings"" on Saturday and Sunday. By Abdujalil Abdurasulov, BBC News, Minsk Sergiy was detained on Monday. Riot police threw him into a police van and started torturing him. They kept asking who the organiser was and each time when he said that there was no such a person, they electrocuted him with a stun gun.  For every word he tried to say, they beat him with batons in response. ""The scariest part was that these people knew no limits,"" he said. This video can not be played Sergiy says riot police in Belarus threatened to burn him alive ""You understand you're totally without any rights, that they could do anything they wanted. The pain was unbearable and I begged him to stop but he continued."" After hours of torture, Sergiy could barely breathe. Officers called an ambulance and sent him to hospital. Otherwise he might not have survived the notorious Okrestina detention centre. Many have faced more vicious beatings and the mistreatment of detainees remaining in prisons continues.  Volunteers outside the detention centre in Minsk on Friday asked us to be quiet and urged people not to clap and chant to support the detainees.  They say that otherwise those who remain behind the prison walls will get beaten in revenge. Prisoners continued to be released from the notorious Okrestina detention centre in Minsk on Friday, revealing their bruised and swollen bodies. ""They beat people ferociously, with impunity, and they arrest anyone. We were forced to stand in the yard all night. We could hear women being beaten. I don't understand such cruelty,"" one man said as he showed the BBC his bruising. Medics treated people as they left Okrestina detention centre on Friday Belarus Interior Minister Yuri Karayev said he took responsibility for people being injured and wanted to apologise to people caught up in the violence. Russian journalist Nikita Telizhenko wrote a harrowing account of his three days inside prison, detailing people lying on the floor of a detention centre, piled on top of each other, in a pool of blood and excrement. They were not allowed to use the toilet for hours on end or even change position. As detainees were allowed to leave the notorious Okrestina detention centre they revealed their wounds Ms Tikhanovskaya, who arrived in Lithuania on Tuesday, said in her video message that Belarus authorities should stop violence and ""engage in dialogue"" and her supporters should sign an online petition calling for a vote recount. In a separate message she praised Belarusians for showing ""we are a majority and this country belongs to us, to the nation rather than one man"". She then called for: a co-ordinating council made up of ""civil society activists, respected Belarusians and professionals"" to secure a transfer of power involvement from personnel from industrial companies, trade unions and other civil society organisations the international community and European states would help organise dialogue with Belarus authorities authorities should free all detainees, remove riot police and troops from the streets and prosecute those who ordered violence. Ms Tikhanovskaya, 37, only entered the presidential race after her husband was arrested and blocked from registering for the vote. Her statements on Friday were a far cry from her last message on Tuesday, when she said she had left Belarus for the sake of her children and spoke of herself as ""a weak woman"". LETTER FROM MINSK:Shocked by violence, people lose their fear SPREADING THE NEWS:How messenger app bypassed blackout PROFILE:The stay-at-home mum challenging Belarus's longtime ruler Belarusians returned to the streets of several cities on Friday. In the western city of Grodno, workers gathered outside a management office, demanding fresh elections, and car workers gathered in big numbers at the Maz plant in Minsk. Walkouts were also reported at a number of other factories. Protesters including tractor workers carried a banner ridiculing the president, who had dismissed protesters as sheep Mr Lukashenko, who has previously dismissed protesters as sheep condemned ""attempts to inflame workers"" and spoke of walkouts involving 20 people. Tractor workers taking part in a big march in Minsk on Friday carried a banner reading: ""We're not sheep, we're not a herd, we're not little people... there are not 20 of us but 16,000.""

Parents urged to be up-to-date with routine jabs,"Parents are being urged to make sure their children are up-to-date with all their routine vaccinations. The Local Government Association said high vaccine uptake could prevent infections and stop pressure being piled on the NHS. The childhood vaccination programme,externalis continuing as normal while jabs given in school are being rescheduled. Vaccines protect children against serious diseases including measles, meningitis and whooping cough. The LGA, which represents councils in England and Wales, said it was expecting an influx of children needing vaccinations when schools return in September. It called for the government to set out a plan to ensure children get the vaccinations they need and to provide funding to allow GPs, clinics and schools to cope with demand. Research by Public Health England found that during the first three weeks of lockdown, there was a 20% drop in the number of MMR (measles, mumps and rubella) vaccines given to young children. Numbers then rose again in late April. There was little impact on uptake of other vaccines, and further analysis by PHE suggests children were vaccinated at normal levels in May and June. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at PHE, said it was ""vital"" that parents knew that routine vaccinations were still available and made sure their children attended appointments. She said this was particularly the case for diseases such as measles, where high vaccination rates were needed to prevent outbreaks. The LGA said a ""national effort"" to vaccinate children and young people was required to relieve pressure on the health service and avoid preventable diseases. Judith Blake, chairwoman of the LGA's Children and Young People Board, said: ""Vaccines are an absolutely essential part of our children's health and wellbeing, so if you or any member of your household are not displaying symptoms of coronavirus and are not self-isolating, vaccinations should happen as normal. ""Local services are working hard to ensure that people including babies, children and pregnant women still receive their routine vaccinations - they provide essential protection against potentially life-threatening diseases.""

Coronavirus cases stable across most of England,"Coronavirus cases across England appear to be levelling off, despite flare-ups in local hotspots, according to estimates from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). An estimated 1 in 1,900, or 28,300 people in England currently have the virus. The ONS said evidence of a ""small increase"" in people testing positive in July has now stabilised. It has been regularly testing people in private households since April. The ONS survey provides a consistent picture of what's been happening, because it regularly tests a large group of people - whether they have symptoms or not. That means any changes are down to fewer or more infections, not just because more testing is taking place. In areas where there have been spikes, more testing takes place. Looking at the government's figures, this can make it look like cases are rising, when in fact more are simply being uncovered. ALockdown: What can I do now? Visiting people at home banned in parts of England On the other hand, the relatively small number of people involved in the survey means the conclusions are based on 58 positive tests out of 122,000 swabs in the past six weeks. But the ONS takes this uncertainty into account and even, with a margin of error, believes cases are levelling off. Virus cases 'may be levelling off' in England Public Health England, which does look at confirmed cases along with other measures, said the majority of indicators suggested ""Covid-19 activity remained stable at a national level"". But there was a rise in cases being identified and general ""increases in activity"" in the North West, Yorkshire and Humber and the East Midlands. The area with the most cases per 100,000 people was Pendle, followed by Oldham, Blackburn and Bradford. But in Blackburn, cases are now falling - as they are in Leicester and Calderdale, the next most affected areas.

The Covid Symptom Study app run by company ZOE and researchers at King's College London shows a similar picture. It estimates 22,702 people currently have symptomatic Covid in the UK. Symptom study figures, which are slightly more up to date than ONS figures, also show a rise in cases in July which then tailed off and have since fallen. The government's figures on ""confirmed cases"" - which just look at positive tests, but don't adjust for more tests being done - look like cases are rising.

Police investigate racist hate crime at Army base,"The car was parked inside the camp behind security fencing and gates Military police have been called in to investigate a racist hate crime carried out at a British Army base in Cyprus. A black soldier found racist graffiti sprayed on his car at Dhekelia camp, currently home to troops from 1st Battalion, The Princess Of Wales's Royal Regiment. Photographs show a racist word sprayed on his car. The Ministry of Defence condemned the attack and confirmed a criminal investigation is under way. Photographs released on social media show a white car daubed with a highly offensive racist insult along with what appears to be an attack on the Black Lives Matter movement with ""All Life Matter"" sprayed in black paint across the vehicle. The BBC has confirmed the car belonged to a black soldier serving with the regiment. The incident happened on Thursday while the vehicle was parked inside the camp behind security fencing and gates. The racist abuse sprayed on the car includes the N-word. ""We are actively supporting the criminal investigation into this repellent and wholly unacceptable incident,"" said the Ministry of Defence in a statement. ""We always take the strongest action possible against those responsible for this type of unacceptable behaviour, which is contrary to all we exemplify as an open and welcoming organisation, which draws and relies on people from across the whole of society."" The British Army has two bases in Cyprus, which allow the UK to have a permanent military presence at a strategic point in the eastern Mediterranean,the Army says.,external The incident followsa recent promise by defence chiefs,externalto show ""zero tolerance"" to racism in the armed forces. In a joint letter signed in July, military chiefs also set out a commitment to improving diversity in the forces. 'It wasn't just Army banter - it was racism' Armed forces told to tackle racial discrimination Black, Asian and minority ethnic (BAME) personnelmake up just over 8% of the total armed forces- with a target to increase that proportion to 10% this year. Statistics show that personnel from BAME backgrounds are more likely to complain about bullying harassment and discrimination. Cases of discrimination account for 25% of all the complaints made across the armed forces. Accordingto the ombudsman who oversees those complaints,a ""disproportionate"" number of those come from ethnic minorities. This video can not be played Former soldier Mark de Kretser: ""People called me Apu from The Simpsons"" Earlier this year,the UK's most senior military officer saidmore must be done to tackle racial discrimination in the armed forces.

US Postal Service warns of risks to mail-in votes,"The US Postal Service (USPS) has warned that millions of mail-in votes may not arrive in time to be counted on the presidential election day, 3 November. In letters to states across the country last month, the agency said ""certain deadlines... are incongruous with the Postal Service's delivery standards"". Critics have blamed the new USPS head - a loyal supporter of President Donald Trump - for a slowdown in deliveries. A record number of people are expected to vote by mail due to the pandemic. But on Thursday, Mr Trump said he was blocking additional funding for the USPS to help with election issues, because he opposed mail-in voting. He has repeatedly said mail-in ballots will lead to voting fraud - and give a boost to his rival Democrat Joe Biden. Experts say the mail-in voting system - which is used by the American military and by Mr Trump himself - is safe from tampering. Former President Barack Obama strongly criticised what he described as Mr Trump's ""attempts to undermine the election"", writing on Twitter that the administration was ""more concerned with suppressing the vote than suppressing a virus"". Trump blocks postal funds to stymie mail-in voting Does US postal voting lead to âtremendous fraudâ? Democrats call for probe into US postal service Meanwhile, Congress's two top Democrats - Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer - called on the president to stop his ""assault"" on the postal service and ""allow the 2020 election to proceed without his sabotage tactics"". Their comments come as a poll by Axios/ Survey Monkey found that three quarters of Republican voters plan to vote in person, while more than half of Democratic voters plan to use a mail vote. Private delivery services Fedex and UPS have both rejected calls to help ease the pressure on the postal agency. Meanwhile,the USPS has reportedly begun removing mail sorting machines,external- many of which would normally be used to process ballots during the election - according to Vice. The USPS, which has long been in financial trouble and carries about $160bn (Â£122bn) in debt, sent letters to states across the US in July. It warned that it could not guarantee that all votes cast by mail would arrive on time to be counted. At least 15 states have received a letter, according to NBC News. In a letter to Pennsylvania's secretary of state, the USPS said mail-in ballots requested one week before the 3 November election - allowed under the state's election laws - may not reach their destination on time because the state's deadlines are too tight for its ""delivery standards"". USPS General Counsel Thomas Marshall said a ""mismatch"" between Pennsylvania's laws and the mail system's delivery capabilities ""creates a risk that ballots requested near the deadline under state law will not be returned by mail in time to be counted under your laws as we understand them"". How is Donald Trump doing in the polls? How you can be US president without winning most votes The letter was made public on Thursday as Secretary of State Kathy Boockvar asked the state's supreme court to allow ballots to be counted as long as they were received up to three days after the election. Currently, votes are discarded if they are received after election day. Pennsylvania is a battleground state, which Mr Trump won by less than 1% in the 2016 election. Other battleground states, including Florida and Michigan, also received letters, according to US media reports. The Democratic governor in Pennsylvania's neighbouring New Jersey announced on Friday that the state would pre-emptively send ballots to every registered voter in the state. The process of sending out ballots is known as universal mail-in voting, and has been adopted in nine other US states. By David Willis, BBC North America correspondent American voters have been here before of course. In the year 2000, the entire US presidential election result was decided by a few hundred contested votes in the state of Florida, after ballots were scrutinised and sometimes rejected, and the process dragged on for weeks. President Trump has said he wants a clear result on election night, not a contest that drags on through the courts. But by blocking the allocation of badly needed funding to the beleaguered US postal service, Mr Trump is potentially paving the way to a series of drawn-out legal battles that could stretch on for weeks. According to reports here, conservative groups are marshalling a massive legal effort aimed not only at limiting the allocating of postal ballots, but challenging results that prove unfavourable to them on election night. In possibly the harshest criticism of his successor to date, Barack Obama has accused Donald Trump of attempting to ""kneecap"" the US postal service in order to discourage people from voting, while Mr Trump's Democratic rival Joe Biden has accused the man he is seeking to replace of launching an ""assault on democracy"". Critics say changes made by the new Postmaster General Louis DeJoy - a major Republican donor - like clamping down on overtime and halting late delivery trips have led to an increase in mail waiting times. But Mr Trump told Fox News he was blocking additional funding for the financially troubled agency, because he opposes mail-in voting. ""Now they need that money in order to make the post office work so it can take all of these millions and millions of ballots,"" he said. ""Now, if we don't make a deal, that means they don't get the money. That means they can't have universal mail-in voting, they just can't have it."" Amid the funding controversy, the 300,000-member National Association of Letter Carriers union on Friday endorsed Mr Biden, warning that the ""very survival"" of the USPS was at stake.

Crash investigators confirm train struck landslip,"A derailment which left three people dead happened after the train struck a landslip covering the track,the Rail Accident Investigation Branch has said,external. The driver, conductor and a passenger died when the 06:38 Aberdeen to Glasgow service crashed near Stonehaven. The RAIB said the train had turned back towards Aberdeen after reports of a landslip further down the track. The six-vehicle train had travelled more than a mile when it was derailed after hitting a separate landslip. The track curved to the right, but investigators said the train continued in a straight line for about 100 yards before hitting the parapet of a bridge. Are we doing enough to modernise infrastructure? Tributes paid to three killed in train derailment What we know about the Stonehaven derailment The locomotive at the front of the train continued over the bridge and fell down an embankment, as did the third passenger carriage. The first passenger carriage came to rest on its roof, at right angles to the track, with the second passenger carriage on top of it. The fourth passenger carriage remained upright and also came to rest on top of the first carriage. It was still attached to the rear locomotive. The RAIB said the train had left Stonehaven station and passed Carmont on Wednesday morning when it was stopped by a signaller who had received a report of a landslip further along the track. The decision was taken to return to Aberdeen, and the train was routed back over a crossover at Carmont. The RAIB said it was collecting evidence on the cause and consequences of the accident. It will examine the sequence of events and the actions of those involved, as well as the management of earthworks and drainage in the area, including recent inspections and risk assessments. Tributes have been paid to Brett McCullough, Donald Dinnie and Chris Stuchbury Simon French, chief inspector of the RAIB, said: ""Thankfully, fatal derailments are a rare occurrence on the UK's national network. ""However, landslips and other earthworks failures remain a risk to trains that needs to be constantly managed - and this is becoming even more challenging for the rail industry due to the increasing incidence of extreme weather events."" Driver Brett McCullough, conductor Donald Dinnie and passenger Christopher Stuchbury died in the crash. On Thursday, their families told of their devastation at their deaths. In a fresh tribute on Friday, the Roxburghe House hospice in Aberdeen where Mr Stuchbury volunteered in his spare time said he was ""incredibly caring"". And two police officers from British Transport Police laid flowers in tribute to the men who died. The officers, who knew Mr McCullough and Mr Dinnie for many years, had gone to the scene from their homes as soon as they heard the news. Prince Charles thanked emergency responders for their bravery when he visited the crash site on Friday. He met some of those among the first on the scene, including Pc Liam Mercer and Pc Eilidh McCabe. Police Scotland Chief Inspector Kevin Walker said the visit by was ""very much appreciated by everyone"" and those on scene were ""grateful for the genuine interest he showed in hearing about their experiences"". It earlier emerged that an off-duty rail worker walked a mile to raise the alarm after surviving the accident. Prince Charles visited the scene of the crash on Friday The prince met emergency responders who were among the first on the scene Transport Secretary Michael Mathesontold BBC Scotland's The Ninethat a ""number of actions"" were taken after the derailment to raise the alarm. He said: ""There was a call made by someone who believed that an incident had taken place locally and they contacted Police Scotland. ""There was also an off-duty railway person on the train who, after it derailed, walked around a mile to the next signal box and advised them that an incident had occurred, which allowed Network Rail at its national control centre to close the line. ""During the course of that, Police Scotland obviously dispatched their staff and Network Rail dispatched some of the staff that they had working nearby to respond to the incident."" UK Transport Minister Grant Shapps has asked Network Rail to produce an interim report by 1 September. Network Rail said it would carry out detailed inspections of high-risk trackside slopes with similar characteristics to the site of the Aberdeenshire crash. Dozens of sites across Britain will be assessed using in-house engineers, specialist contractors and helicopter surveys. Scotland's Lord Advocate has asked Police Scotland, British Transport Police and the Office of Rail and Road, the independent regulator, to conduct a joint investigation into the accident. This will run in parallel with the independent safety investigation being carried out by the RAIB. Are we doing enough to modernise infrastructure?

Expert calls for 'missing' Test and Protect data,"Prof Bauld said the data was needed by researchers A public health expert is calling on the Scottish government to release details on the number of people contacted by NHS Test and Protect. Prof Linda Bauld believes the ""missing"" data is essential for researchers to check the system is working. After schools reopened,and the infection rate appeared to rise, pressure is mounting to prove the system can fulfil its role. The figures were promised before pupils returned to school. The Scottish government says they will now be available at the end of August. Prof Bauld, from Edinburgh University, has said that failure to publish the data showed a lack of transparency on the government's part. Speaking onGood Morning Scotlandon Friday, she said it was the ""missing piece"" of the jigsaw. She said: ""The data published so far only contains number of close contacts successfully traced and spoken to, but what it doesn't contain is the proportion of contacts not reached. ""I want to see all the data to understand what's going on. All we have at the moment is the number of people who have been tested and the number of people who are contacts. ""We don't know the proportion of people that are being followed up, how long it is taking to do that and we don't know what happens to those people who are followed up. ""We need to see all of that data to be confident the system is working as it should be."" She believes the government has that level of information after the first minister revealed that duringthe Aberdeen outbreak, a significant portion of contacts were traced within a day and all the contacts were found within three days. The professor said that Scotland has done ""extremely well"" on other areas of the data but outlined the information she would also like to see published. ""What I would like to see, is the proportion of contacts reported by index case, so that's the person who tested positive, that have been successfully reached, so that's that percentage,"" she said. ""Also the time taken to reach the individual, that's crucial because to shut down the chains of transmission it needs to be rapid and I'd also like to see whether follow-up occurs for those who are asked to isolate. ""Finally, and this is probably optional but would be interesting, whether cases have been symptomatic or not because there's routine testing in care homes and in the NHS and of course those people will have contacts as well so let's aim to be even better than the countries that are currently reporting that data and give all of that data, not just to researchers like me but to the public as well."" Schools returned across Scotland this week Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said the government was working hard to ensure the efficiency of the Test and Protect system. He told the BBC:  ""When that data is available, and available in a form that can be verified, then of course we would release that data. This government has released data throughout this pandemic to be as transparent as possible."" Questioned on why schools have reopened without information on the proportion of contacts traced being known, he said: ""We would not take any gamble or any risk when it comes to young people's education. In fact, what we've said from day one is that our children's education is a priority."" He added: ""There's a number of harms we have to balance, a range of data we have to look at. And having looked at that data, we're confident that schools can reopen."" Analysis by Kenneth Macdonald, BBC Scotland science correspondent When tracking this pandemic it can be easy to forget that all these numbers are people.  But the authorities need the big numbers to build the big picture of how the virus is attacking Scotland. And when some promised data fails to make an appearance the conspiracy antennae tends to twitch. But here the reality is more prosaic. Latest data shows a rise in the estimated R number in Scotland The Scottish government's figures already tell us how many cases of the virus are known about and how many close contacts each of these people has reported. However, there are known unknowns. How many contacts can't be found - and how quickly are the contact tracers finding the ones that can be? It's clear that the people who need those numbers most urgently - the ones doing the virus detective work and tracking down people who may not realise they are at risk - have the data they need. But the rest of us will have to wait a while longer. Ministers say the data is not yet in a robust enough state to be released widely. Why does it matter?A recent Lancet paper,externalsuggested that 68% of close contacts would have to be traced for schools to reopen safely across the UK. While we don't yet know officially if that target has been reached - and Scotland's schools are already open - the early, albeit anecdotal, indications are that it is being exceeded comfortably. What's more, most Scots are said to be responding well when the contact tracers call. This is particularly good news because in the absence of a vaccine the most effective weapon against the virus is us. Jamie Halcro Johnston from the Scottish Conservatives said Scots were likely to be living with the coronavirus and the impact of it for some time and needed to have the confidence that the systems were in place and working. He said: ""We are talking about a health pandemic, and confidence in the government is different to confidence in a system which is either working or it isn't. ""There are no indications there are problems but we just don't know that because the Scottish government haven't provided the data - despite saying they would."" The system will be primarily telephone-based but apps are in development A Scottish government spokeswoman said: ""The Scottish government is committed to setting out as much data as possible about the Covid-19 pandemic to help inform and improve our response. ""We work closely with National Records of Scotland and Public Health Scotland to ensure the figures we publish are robust, and will publish significantly more information about the contact tracing process, including the percentage of positive cases followed up, time taken to reach individuals who had tested positive and time taken to reach their contacts. We expect to publish this data by the end of August.""

New Covid rules in force for bars and restaurants,"Bars and restaurants should be providing table service and taking contact details Bars and restaurants in Scotland are now required by law to collect customers' contact details. Guidance such as providing table service, pre-booking and avoiding customers standing together or queuing is also now mandatory. There should be no background music and TVs should be muted so that people do not have to lean in to be heard. The Scottish government said police and local environmental health teams would enforce the rules if necessary. Announcing the measures last week, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the outbreak in Aberdeen and elsewhere had underlined how coronavirus could easily be spread in settings such as pubs. On Friday, Ms Sturgeon confirmed that 198 cases were now associated with the cluster and, to date, 1,032 contacts had so far been identified. The first minister also said 28 of the 65 new cases in Scotland were detected by NHS Grampian. Tighter rules on visors, masks and contacts During her daily media briefing she said: ""We know that pubs and restaurants are higher risk locations for transmission of Covid and we are seeing that reflected in out data right now."" Ms Sturgeon also urged people to limit the number of pubs they visited in one day and warned that customers who refused to provide their details should not be served. She said: ""The more settings you go to the more likely you will be to get Covid and the more likely you might be to spread it."" And Ms Sturgeon stressed that the Aberdeen outbreak emphasised the threat still posed by the virus. She added: ""Nobody's life should be feeling absolutely normal yet. Nobody's social life should feel exactly as it was before Covid struck."" However, Ms Sturgeon said the possibility of allowing ""acceptable decibel levels"" for TVs and music was being examined. It emerged on Friday that a restaurant in East Renfrewshire had closed after a positive coronavirus case was linked to it. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said anyone who visited the Ca Va Brasserie in Giffnock from mid-afternoon onwards on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday should look out for symptoms associated with the virus, such as a fever or persistent cough. A spokesman for the restaurant said: ""A member of staff tested positive for Covid-19. As soon as this was discovered we closed the restaurant and arranged for a thorough clean. ""The safety of staff and customers is our absolute priority, and we won't reopen until that can be assured."" The hospitality sector had already been urged to take customers' contact details to allow the Test and Protect system of contact tracing to function While many businesses had complied with the guidance, Ms Sturgeon earlier said others had not and it was therefore necessary to tighten the rules. The first minister said putting the guidance on a statutory basis, meaning it was backed up by law, would ""help to clarify exactly what is required of the hospitality industry"". Businesses were given seven days to prepare for the new tighter rules but were urged to act sooner to ensure the guidance was being followed. Contact details may be kept by businesses for 21 days after which they must be destroyed or deleted.

Princess Anne turns 70 on Saturday and her birthday is being marked with the release of three official photographs taken at her home in Gatcombe Park, Gloucestershire. The pictures were taken in late February by John Swannell, who has also photographed other senior royals as well as Tony Blair, Sir Michael Caine and Sir Elton John. The photos were taken at her home, which has 730 acres of land and a lake Speaking earlier this week, Anne's son-in-law Mike Tindall said plans to mark the day have been ""scaled back"" because of the coronavirus pandemic. ""We did have plans - it would've been up in Scotland - but obviously with Covid and Aberdeen being locked down a bit, I think everything's been scaled back a little bit,"" said the former England rugby star, who is married to Anne's daughter Zara, on The One Show. ""It's a shame. I'm sure we'll do something as a family to celebrate her 70 amazing years, she's just an incredible woman in terms of how much work she can get through in the year. ""We will be doing something, as yet I don't know whether she knows - so my lips are sealed."" In one of the new photos, Anne wears a gold ribbon knot brooch set with 12 diamonds Speaking about her military promotion, which has been approved by the Queen, the Ministry of Defence said Anne had been ""hugely supportive"" of the armed forces.

Juries to hear courtroom trials from cinemas,"Juries will hear trials remotely from cinemas under plans to stop a growing backlog of criminal cases. The move will see the most serious criminal trials go ahead in courtrooms while a socially-distanced jury watches a video-link in a cinema. The Lord Justice General Lord Carloway described the plan as ""bold and imaginative"". But he warned of a ""long term project"" to clear the backlog of cases postponed due to Covid-19. Lord Carloway said there were about 750 outstanding High Court and 1,800 Sheriff Court cases as a result of the courts being closed by the pandemic earlier this year. He told BBC Scotland this ""illustrates the seriousness of the position"" and added that the ""remote jury approach is the only practical way which has been identified to reduce that backlog."" Strict physical distancing measures have been in place since trials resumed at the High Court in Edinburgh High Court trialsrestarted last month in Edinburgh and Glasgow, having been paused during the pandemic. Juries have been observing trials via a video link from another courtroom. But moving the juries to watch cases from cinemas will free up increased space for more trials. The Scottish Courts and Tribunals Service (SCTS) hope jury centres based in cinema complexes in the east and west of Scotland, with capacity for at least 16 juries, will be in place by the autumn. Lady Dorrian, chairwoman of the restarting solemn trials working group, said: ""The beauty of this solution is that it preserves the 15-person jury trial and will allow us, in time, to raise business in the High Court to a level that will start to address the growing backlog of cases. ""It was clear that the remote jury model does work and, if suitable external venues could be identified, it would be possible to run a much higher number of trials, making full use of the courtrooms we have available for the trials."" Tape in the dock reminds the accused to keep their distance from the security guards at the High Court Eric McQueen, chief executive of the SCTS, said: ""The great advantage of these remote jury centres is that they provide, in a single building, a number of spacious and soundproofed auditoria that can comfortably accommodate 15 physically-distanced jurors, combined with state-of-the-art secure technology. ""It also means we have a model that can be replicated at various sites around the country."" The cinemas used will be staffed by SCTS staff and made to look as much like a court as possible. Justice Secretary Humza Yousaf said Â£5.5m of Scottish government money will fund the scheme, which he said was a ""ground-breaking solution"". He added: ""Our funding of this scheme not only allows serious criminal cases to proceed but also provides reassurance to victims, witnesses and accused who have been adversely affected by case delays.""

Dolly Parton: 'Of course black lives matter!',"US country music star Dolly Parton has come out in support of Black Lives Matter, in a rare comment on politics. She told Billboard Magazine: ""Do we think our little white asses are the only ones that matter? No!"" With a broad fan base that spans the right and the left, the singer generally eschews political subjects. Her comments come amid a nationwide reckoning on race that has impacted all of US society, including country music. Although Ms Parton has not attended Black Lives Matter marches, she said she supported anti-racism activists' right to protest. ""I understand people having to make themselves known and felt and seen,""she told the music magazine,external. The entertainment mogul - who owns Dollywood amusement park in her home state of Tennessee as well as other attractions - also spoke about her decision in 2018 to drop the ""Dixie"" from her Dixie Stampede attraction. A 2017 article in Slate critiqued Ms Parton's attraction, calling it a ""lily-white kitsch extravaganza"". ""Dixie"" was often used as a nickname for the southern states that made up the Confederate States of America during the US Civil War era. US country band Dixie Chicks drop the Dixie from their name ""There's such a thing as innocent ignorance, and so many of us are guilty of that,"" she told Billboard. ""When they said 'Dixie' was an offensive word, I thought, 'Well, I don't want to offend anybody. This is a business. We'll just call it The Stampede.' ""As soon as you realise that [something] is a problem, you should fix it. Don't be a dumbass. That's where my heart is. I would never dream of hurting anybody on purpose."" George Floyd's death, and the subsequent nationwide protests, has impacted industries from publishing to sport to country music, inspiring some artists to join marches while forcing others to reconsider their own racial blindspots. Two other country acts, the Dixie Chicks and Lady Antebellum, have dropped words linked to the Confederacy from their names, becoming The Chicks and Lady A, respectively. This video can not be played Four numbers that explain the impact of George Floyd's death on US society President Donald Trump has taken the opposite approach, describing protesters as ""anarchists"" and condemning those who kneel for the national anthem. Ms Parton's comments come as the 2020 presidential election campaign heats up, a stark contrast with four years ago when she assiduously avoided criticising Mr Trump when he was running against Hillary Clinton. In 2017, she remained quiet on stage at the Emmys next to Lily Tomlin and Jane Fonda, when her former 9-to-5 costars decided to use the spotlight to slam the president. More recently, in the popular WNYC podcast Dolly Parton's America, Ms Parton said: ""If you hate the president so much, why don't we pray for him?"" This is not the first time the 74 year old, who is seen as both an LGBT and feminist icon, has supported progressive causes. She came out in favour of gay marriage in 2014, a year before it was legalised nationwide, spoke against anti-transgender ""bathroom bills"", and supported the Me Too movement. But her support for left-leaning issues is usually carefully crafted to be as inoffensive as possible, often urging people to ""judge not lest ye be judged"". ""The sin of judging is just as bad as any other sin they might say somebody else is committing. I try to love everybody,"" she told Billboard in 2014.

Coronavirus cases stable across most of EnglandA survey by the Office for National Statistics suggests fewer than 0.05% of the population has the virus.,"Coronavirus cases across England appear to be levelling off, despite flare-ups in local hotspots, according to estimates from the Office for National Statistics (ONS). An estimated 1 in 1,900, or 28,300 people in England currently have the virus. The ONS said evidence of a ""small increase"" in people testing positive in July has now stabilised. It has been regularly testing people in private households since April. The ONS survey provides a consistent picture of what's been happening, because it regularly tests a large group of people - whether they have symptoms or not. That means any changes are down to fewer or more infections, not just because more testing is taking place. In areas where there have been spikes, more testing takes place. Looking at the government's figures, this can make it look like cases are rising, when in fact more are simply being uncovered. ALockdown: What can I do now? Visiting people at home banned in parts of England On the other hand, the relatively small number of people involved in the survey means the conclusions are based on 58 positive tests out of 122,000 swabs in the past six weeks. But the ONS takes this uncertainty into account and even, with a margin of error, believes cases are levelling off. Virus cases 'may be levelling off' in England Public Health England, which does look at confirmed cases along with other measures, said the majority of indicators suggested ""Covid-19 activity remained stable at a national level"". But there was a rise in cases being identified and general ""increases in activity"" in the North West, Yorkshire and Humber and the East Midlands. The area with the most cases per 100,000 people was Pendle, followed by Oldham, Blackburn and Bradford. But in Blackburn, cases are now falling - as they are in Leicester and Calderdale, the next most affected areas.

Enter a full UK postcode, English, Welsh or Northern Irish council name, or Scottish health board name to find out If you can't see the look-up click here.,external The government's Scientific Advisory Group on Emergencies (Sage) believes the virus's reproduction or R number is at or below one, indicating the virus is stable or slightly falling. The Covid Symptom Study app run by company ZOE and researchers at King's College London shows a similar picture. It estimates 22,702 people currently have symptomatic Covid in the UK. Symptom study figures, which are slightly more up to date than ONS figures, also show a rise in cases in July which then tailed off and have since fallen. The government's figures on ""confirmed cases"" - which just look at positive tests, but don't adjust for more tests being done - look like cases are rising.

Oxford college 'will honour UK A-level offers',"Worcester College, Oxford said it had offered places to its ""most diverse cohort ever"" An Oxford college has said it will honour all places it offered to UK students, irrespective of their A-level results. Therehas been anger amongschools, colleges and students since Thursday when 40% of awarded A-level gradeswere lower than teachers' predictions. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the results were a ""robust set of grades"". Worcester College said it had given offers to its ""most diverse cohort ever"" before exams were cancelled. There has been widespread concern about the fairness of the ""calculated"" results In England, 36% of entries had a lower grade than teachers predicted and 3% were down two grades after exams were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. School and college leaders are calling for a review and have said all fees for appeals should be waived. However, the overall results, across England, Northern Ireland and Wales, show record highs for A* and A grades. Astatement on the website of Worcester College,external, which has about 700 students, said: ""Many members of our college community and beyond have expressed their concern for the potential impact of yesterday's A-level results on this year's incoming students. ""At Worcester we made offers in 2020 to our most diverse cohort ever, and in response to the uncertainties surrounding this year's assessment, we have confirmed the places of all our UK offer-holders, irrespective of their A-level results."" How have my exam results been decided this year? A-level results: 'My future has been set back completely' What's next in the arguments over exam results? Staff at another Oxford college, which has not confirmed places, told the BBC they had been ""flooded with emails"" from concerned alumni that deserving students could lose out. An open letter to the university, signed by more than 2,700 alumni, called for all colleges to make offers unconditional, with deferred entry where courses were full. The letter, organised by two Balliol College graduates, said: ""Brilliant pupils from economically disadvantaged schools have seen their dreams dashed - while others from wealthy backgrounds saw their predicted grades confirmed."" Organisers Hannah O'Rourke and Liam Whitton said the government's ""discriminatory algorithm... operates on an assumption that individuals cannot transcend their backgrounds"". This year's A-level results are higher than even before, with record highs for A* and A grades The prime minister has said pupils would be able to sit exams in the autumn if they felt they ""could have done better"" or felt there had been ""an injustice"". He added: ""But looking at the big picture, I think overall we've got a very robust set of grades, plus you've got the situation in which more pupils than ever before are getting their first choice course at university and more kids from disadvantaged backgrounds going to university.""

Free exam appeals for schools in England,"There has been widespread concern about the fairness of the 'calculated' results The government will cover the cost of schools in England appealing against exam grades after students had 280,000 A-level results downgraded. Ministers are also expected to set up a taskforce, led by Schools Minister Nick Gibb, to oversee the appeals process. The government previously said it wants the process to conclude by 7 September. But letting schools make appeals free of charge is ""cold comfort"" for pupils, the Liberal Democrats said, adding the move ""should never have been needed"". Education Secretary Gavin Williamson told the Times the government would cover the fees in a bid to ensure that head teachers were not deterred from making appeals. Oxford college 'will honour UK A-level offers' Anger over 'unfair' A-level results There had been fears that the costs - which can reach Â£150 - could stop schools from taking on harder to prove cases. The regulator, Ofqual, will give more details next week. Nearly 40% of A-level grades awardedon Thursday were lower than teachers' assessments, prompting anger among schools, colleges and students. Mr Gibb promised that the appeals system will be ""robust"" after facing a call during BBC Radio 4's Any Questions on Friday from a student who said she had been rejected by her chosen university. Nina, from Peterborough, said her grades fell three grades lower than her teachers' estimates. She was expected to achieve ABB and scored As and Bs in her mock exams but was handed three D grades. She told Mr Gibb she was distraught after failing to meet her offer from the Royal Veterinary College. ""You have ruined my life,"" she told him. ""It won't ruin your life, it will be sorted, I can assure you,"" Mr Gibb said. He added: ""There will be these mistakesâ¦ we do know there are imperfections somewhere in the system as a result of this model. There are no models that can improve on that, this is the problem."" Samantha Smith, a grammar school student from Telford, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that her results had been downgraded from As and A* grades to a B, E and U. ""I know I didn't sit the exam but I didn't think I'd be treated as if I didn't turn up for the exam,"" she said. ""I've now got no university places, because of the algorithm and the system of being treated as if your postcode matters more than your potential."" Why did the A-level algorithm say no? While many students discovered they lost their university places,Oxford's Worcester College said it will honour all offersit made to UK students, irrespective of their A-level results. Admissions tutor Prof Laura Ashe said it was ""the morally right thing to do"". Because students had not taken any exams, ""we took the view there wasn't going to be any new information that could justify rejecting someone to whom we'd made an offer"", she said. She said the algorithm used to adjust grades ""literally copied the inequalities that are currently existing in our education system"", with a quarter of the college's state school applicants being downgraded, but only 10% of private school candidates. Ofqual adjusted the results to make the spread of grades look right at a national level, she said, but ""they can't possibly tell us that they've given the right grades to the right people"". The Liberal Democrats welcomed the announcement over appeals costs, but called on Mr Williamson to resign. The party's education spokeswoman, Layla Moran, said: ""For the young people who have worked so hard to not get the results they deserve, through no fault of their own, this announcement alone will be cold comfort."" ""While this should never have been needed, it is right the government has listened to the Liberal Democrats and others and U-turned."" Ms Moran added: ""Ultimately, after Gavin Williamson's botched handling of the process thus far, pupils will have no confidence in him to fix the broken glass. Before he causes any more hurt, he must go."" Earlier, Labour called on ministers to act immediately to sort out an ""exams fiasco"" in England and stop thousands of A-level students being ""betrayed"". And some Tory MPs have challenged the fairness of how grades have been decided. BBC News political correspondent Helen Catt said having ""an efficient and effective"" appeals process ""is going to be really important in making sure more Tories don't join them"". After exams were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic, grades were awarded using a controversial modelling system, with the key factors being the ranking order of pupils and the previous exam results of schools and colleges. This produced more top grades than have ever been seen before in A-levels, with almost 28% getting A* and As, but head teachers have been angry about ""unfathomable"" individual injustices in the downgrading of some results. In England, 36% of entries had grades lower than their teachers predicted and 3% were down two grades. There has since been calls to switch away from this system and to use teachers' predictions, in the way that the government U-turned in Scotland. But England's exam watchdog Ofqual has warned that using teachers' predictions would have artificially inflated results - and would have seen about 38% of entries getting A*s and As. Labour said the lack of consistency in individual results was ""heartbreaking"" for those affected and the government was squarely to blame for sticking with a ""fatally flawed results system"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson has previously defended what he said were a ""robust set"" of grades and said that pupils who believed they were treated unfairly would be able to appeal or, if they wanted, sit exams in the autumn. Schools can appeal for an upgrade if their pupils' mock grades were higher than their estimated results. But the exam regulator Ofqual has still to say how a mock exam result can be validated - and head teachers have warned that mocks are not standardised or taken by all pupils, and could not be used as a fair way of deciding final exam results.

North England Covid-19 restrictions extended,"Restrictions on social gatherings will continue in parts of the North West and Yorkshire Lockdown restrictions on social gatherings for parts of northern England will continue despite measures being relaxed across the country. In Greater Manchester cases have risen in Oldham, with a similar trend in Pendle, Lancashire, while case numbers remain high in Blackburn with Darwen. Bradford and Kirklees in Yorkshire have also seen case numbers rise. The government will work with leaders in the region to address the rising trends. The ban on indoor gathering continues to apply in these areas and people will continue to be prohibited from mixing with other households within private homes or gardens. Oldham had 112 cases per 100,000 people in the week up to 8 August, the highest in the country. Blackburn with Darwen Council, which figures for the week up to 10 August show had 82 cases per 100,000 people, said it was looking to increase local testing. Despite an England-wide easing of restrictions planned from Saturday with reopening of venues including casinos, bowling alleys and conference halls, such places in Greater Manchester, West Yorkshire and East Lancashire will remain shut. Pools, indoor gyms and other leisure facilities as well as nail bars, spas and beauty salons will open across England but will remain closed in Blackburn and Bradford, with shielding to continue for people in Blackburn with Darwen.

Extra measures were put in place in Oldham in July after a rise in positive cases ""Earlier this week we warned of the risk of imminent lockdown for the borough and, despite today's announcement, those warnings remain,"" she said. ""In the absence of a vaccine, an effective testing and tracing system is vital in the management of this crisis. We welcome the opportunity to work more closely with government both to improve our access to government testing facilities for residents and to deliver more contact tracing at a local level."" In a joint statement Blackburn with Darwen Council leader Mohammed Khan, Sayyed Osman, director of adult social care and Prof Dominic Harrison, director of public health, said the local authority has acted ""decisively and proactively since cases started to rise"". ""We have been lobbying for increased testing capability, including hyperlocal community testing; more funding for businesses and more funding to help people who unable to work because they are isolating,"" they said. ""As many people as possible need to get tested as well as it helps us understand what is happening with the virus in our borough."" The council did not rule out the possibility of further lockdown measures which it said could be imposed unless ""significant progress"" is made in reducing cases. Health minister Edward Argar said it was ""essential"" people remained vigilant. ""I urge everyone in these areas to continue to follow the rules - wash your hands regularly, follow social distancing, get yourself a free test as soon as you get any symptoms, and isolate if NHS Test and Trace tells you to,"" he said.

Senedd committee recalled over A-level resultsMembers will look into students' and teachers' concerns after 42% of grades were lowered.Wales politics,"Education Minister Kirsty Williams met students at Merthyr College on results day The Welsh Government's handling of exam results is to be ""urgently"" examined by a Senedd committee amid criticism over the grading of A-levels. Students have accused the Welsh Government of ""abandoning them"" after 42% of grades were lowered by the exams watchdog. As head teachers described the results as ""unjust"", the Senedd's education committee has been recalled. But First Minister Mark Drakeford has said it was ""a record year"" for pupils. ""The big picture is we have more students achieving, more students achieving at the very top end of the scale, and a record number of people from Wales accepted into university,"" he told BBC Wales. The handling of the results system has seen the Labour government come under fire from head teachers and some of its own backbenchers, who said some pupils had got results two grades lower than predicted. This video can not be played Bradley Desmier was predicted a B, C and a merit but got a D, E and a pass The Welsh Parliament is on its summer break, but the Children, Young People and Education Committee will now meet on Tuesday. Chair Lynne Neagle said decision-makers must explain what happened to provide ""clarity"", ahead of the publication of GCSE results next week. ""Young people's well-being, and their ability to plan for their future learning and careers, will be at the centre of our work looking at these issues,"" she said. ""We recognise that these matters are complex and will need detailed, longer term consideration. However, we believe that there is an important role for us to play now, to ask questions which will ensure that a fair and clear approach is adopted and communicated to the Welsh people as quickly as possible."" Exams were cancelled after schools were closed in March Mike Hedges, Labour member of the Senedd for Swansea East, had said he knew of pupils receiving a lower than predicted grade ""without any samples of their work being checked"". But Mr Drakeford told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast: ""I read what people said, and I don't agree that it was strong criticism."" Labour MS for Aberavon David Rees has backed calls for a ""full review"" to examine whether poorer areas have been more affected by the grading system than more affluent areas. ""The robust and fair quotes that the government is talking about is of course consistency across Wales, but I do not believe that that has actually been fair to individuals,"" he told BBC Radio Wales. ""These are young people whose futures are on the line."" Unfair results claim after grades lowered Minister makes pledge on this year's grades Exams were cancelled this summer due to the coronavirus pandemic, with results based on teacher estimates. But 42% were downgraded by exams watchdog,Qualifications Wales, after it judged the grades were ""too generous"". On Wednesday, Education Minister Kirsty Williams promised that students would be guaranteed a grade no lower than they achieved at AS-level. But with the last-minute intervention coming after results had already been sent to schools and colleges, there are concerns that universities may judge applications on the grades already issued, before that revision takes effect. In an open letter to Ms Williams, 16 members of the Welsh Youth Parliament also called for action. Welsh Youth Parliament member Jonathan Powell says students feel ""abandoned"" A-level student and Wrexham youth parliament member Jonathan Powell said: ""Not only have you abandoned thousands of students who did not have a chance to sit their exams, but you have demonstrated a lack of respect and trust in teachers across the nation."" He said he had been predicted to achieve A* and A grades, but was awarded a single A grade and Bs. ""How is it justifiable that A*s are brought down to Bs?"" he asked. Abbie Cooper, 17, from Cwmbran is another member of the youth parliament who signed the letter. She said her predicted AS-level grades were downgraded from three Bs to an unclassified and two D grades. ""It kind of feels like they just got a number generator or a letter generator and given you a grade based on that,"" she said. ""It sucks because I need these to apply for university next year because these are my predicted for university. How can I go anywhere with these?"" She said it had left her felling ""distraught"" and she would now be appealing the results. Natalie Johns said her future was decided by people who did not know her work or what she could and had achieved When Natalie Johns opened her A-level results on Thursday, the results were not what she was predicted. The 18-year-old's teachers had calculated she would get all A*s, meaning she would meet the requirements of her conditional offer to study psychology at Cambridge University. But when she opened her results at Y Pant School, in Rhondda Cynon Taff, her results had been lowered to one A* in biology, with As in maths and psychology. The teenager had a desperate 24 hours after her chosen college said they could not accept her, and she was put in a ""summer pool"" waiting to see if another college would let her in. But she has since had the good news she has been accepted after her school and MP got involved, but said she would still be fighting to get the grade changed. ""It is not important right now, but these A-level results are going to stick with me for life - if I am going for a job, it's not going to have a sticker next to it saying the grade is because of Covid-19,"" she said. ""It was such a let down, that this is how we were treated and how our [school] education came to an end."" Natalie said she was angry with the Welsh Government for their response to students' concerns. ""They are almost bragging about how you can't go lower than your AS grade, but you can't get an A* at AS-level,"" said Natalie. ""For high achievers wanting to go on to study medicine and other subjects, it really matters. It's the injustice of it."" Some pupils were pleased with their results Head teachers in north Wales said the way results were allocated was ""unfair"" and ""impossible to fathom"", saying their own teachers' estimates had been done with ""professionalism and fairness"". The Federation of North Wales Secondary School Head Teachers said many universities had lowered their offers due to a shortage of international students during the pandemic. But while that meant many students would be able to attend their university of choice, the A-level grades would be ""with them for the rest of their lives"". Claire Armitstead, head teacher of Rhyl High School, said the system had generated ""numerous inconsistencies"". ""It can never be forgotten that every inconsistency is a child whose life has been turned upside by an algorithm and this cannot be allowed to happen,"" she said. ""It is unjust and immoral and our children deserve better."" Geraint Parry, head teacher at Ysgol Brynhyfryd, in Ruthin, Denbighshire, said: ""Students have been disregarded, downgraded and simply told 'computer says no'."" Ellen Williams, head of Llanrug's Ysgol Brynrefail, Gwynedd, said the grading system had ""resulted in many of our young people's lives being devastated"". Plaid Cymru's leader also urged Mr Drakeford to ensure pupils in Wales awarded lower grades received their predicted results instead. In a letter to the first minister, Adam Price said this should also apply to next week's GCSE results ""and this should be communicated to learners today, for peace of mind"". Mr Price pointed to comments from the UK Labour leader Keir Starmer, who has said ministers in Englandmust follow the lead of Scotland and allow teacher assessed marks to be accepted. But Wales' first minister said Mr Starmer was referring to the position in: ""England, where they don't have AS-levels; England where you have to pay for an appeal; England where people will be kept waiting for longer for results than they have here in Wales. ""Our position is very different."" A pupil from Swansea checking her results on Thursday A Welsh Government spokesman said about 94% of the grades were the same or within one grade of those students were predicted to achieve. ""This is before any adjustments are made as a result of the AS [level] floor announced yesterday by the minister for education,"" he added. ""We have also asked Qualifications Wales to consider whether the grounds for appeal can be broadened for all A-level, AS-level and GCSE qualifications and we expect to provide more information on this next week. ""No student from Wales should be disadvantaged against other UK students. ""We are pleased that, following the publication of the results today, UCAS have reported the highest number of Welsh learners being offered a place at university since 2011.""

Trump 'abhorrent' for fuelling Harris conspiracy,"Joe Biden named Kamala Harris his running mate - she is the first woman of colour on a major party ticket The campaign team for Democratic White House candidate Joe Biden has issued a scathing response after US President Donald Trump amplified a conspiracy theory about his running mate. Mr Trump said he had ""heard"" that Kamala Harris - a US-born citizen whose parents were immigrants - ""doesn't qualify"" to serve as US vice-president. The fringe theory has been dismissed by constitutional experts. The Biden campaign called the comments ""abhorrent"" and ""pathetic"". They noted that Mr Trump spent years promoting a false ""birther"" theory that ex-President Barack Obama was not born in the US. Ms Harris, a senator from California, on Tuesday became the first black woman and the first Asian-American to be named as a running mate on a main-party US presidential ticket. ""Donald Trump was the national leader of the grotesque, racist birther movement with respect to President Obama and has sought to fuel racism and tear our nation apart on every single day of his presidency,"" a Biden campaign spokesman said in an email. ""So it's unsurprising, but no less abhorrent, that as Trump makes a fool of himself straining to distract the American people from the horrific toll of his failed coronavirus response that his campaign and their allies would resort to wretched, demonstrably false lies in their pathetic desperation."" Profile: Who is Kamala Harris? Why Kamala Harris embraces her biracial roots How Kamala Harris could help - or hurt - Joe Biden Ms Harris was born to a Jamaican father and Indian mother in Oakland, California, on 20 October 1964. As such, she is eligible to serve as president or vice-president. Constitutional scholars have dismissed the fringe legal theory that Mr Trump was referring to. To be vice-president or president, Kamala Harris ""has to be a natural-born citizen, at least 35 years old, and a resident in the United States for at least 14 years"", Juliet Sorensen, a law professor at Northwestern University, told the Associated Press news agency. ""She is. That's really the end of the inquiry."" Anyone born in the US and subject to its jurisdiction is a natural born citizen, regardless of the citizenship of their parents, says the Cornell Legal Information Institute. After a conservative law professor questioned Ms Harris' eligibility based on her parents' immigration status at the time of her birth, Mr Trump was asked about the argument at a press conference on Thursday. The president said: ""I just heard it today that she doesn't meet the requirements and by the way the lawyer that wrote that piece is a very highly qualified, very talented lawyer. This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? ""I have no idea if that's right. I would have assumed the Democrats would have checked that out before she gets chosen to run for vice-president. ""But that's a very serious, you're saying that, they're saying that she doesn't qualify because she wasn't born in this country."" The reporter replied there was no question that Ms Harris was born in the US, simply that her parents might not have been permanent US residents at the time. Earlier on Thursday, a Trump campaign adviser, Jenna Ellis, reposted a tweet from the head of conservative group Judicial Watch, Tim Fitton. In that tweet, Mr Fitton questioned whether Ms Harris was ""ineligible to be vice-president under the US constitution's 'citizenship clause'"". This video can not be played Kamala Harris' childhood home reacts to Biden pick He also sharedthe opinion piece published in Newsweek,externalmagazine by John Eastman, a law professor at Chapman University in California, that Mr Trump was asked about. Prof Eastman cites Article II of the US Constitution's wording that ""no person except a natural born citizenâ¦ shall be eligible to the office of president"". He also points out that the 14th Amendment to the constitution says ""all persons bornâ¦ in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens"". This video can not be played A look back at Joe Biden's life and political career Prof Eastman's argument, which he claims is also being made by other ""commentators"", hinges on the idea that Ms Harris may not have been subject to US jurisdiction if her parents were, for example, on student visas at the time of their daughter's birth in California. ""Her father was (and is) a Jamaican national, her mother was from India, and neither was a naturalized US citizen at the time of Harris' birth in 1964. That, according to these commentators, makes her not a 'natural born citizen' - and therefore ineligible for the office of the president and, hence, ineligible for the office of the vice president,"" he wrote in the Newsweek op-ed. Experts in constitutional law have dismissed his claims In 2010, Prof Eastman ran to be the Republican candidate for California attorney general. He lost to Steve Cooley, who went on to be defeated by Ms Harris, the Democratic candidate, in the general election. Following furious backlash to the Newsweek op-ed, its editor-in-chief Nancy Cooper stood by the decision to publish, arguing on Thursday that Prof Eastman's article had ""nothing to do with racist birtherism"" and was instead ""focusing on a long-standing, somewhat arcane legal debate"". Berkeley Law School Dean Erwin Chemerinsky told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that Prof Eastman's argument about Ms Harris' eligibility was ""truly silly"". ""Under section 1 of the 14th Amendment, anyone born in the United States is a United States citizen. The Supreme Court has held this since the 1890s. Kamala Harris was born in the United States,"" he said. Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School, told the Associated Press: ""Let's just be honest about what it is: It's just a racist trope we trot out when we have a candidate of colour whose parents were not citizens.""

The story of the Mangrove Nine," Echoes of black lives matter from 50 years ago By Ashley John-Baptiste By Ashley John-Baptiste  It was a summer Sunday afternoon and most locals were home. Curtains twitched and front doors opened. Some residents ventured bravely outside to witness the scene. Their quiet backstreet in west London had become a battleground. At a noisy but otherwise peaceful march to protest at “police harassment” of black people, fighting between protesters and police had broken out. Nine people would end up at the Old Bailey in a high-profile, but now much-forgotten, trial that secured an important spot in the timeline of black British people. This article has imagery of a pig’s head which some readers may find upsetting. In March 1968 a new all-night restaurant - the Mangrove - opened on All Saints Road in Notting Hill. Run by Trinidadian-born entrepreneur, Frank Crichlow, it was dimly lit with black leather furniture. Woman outside the Mangrove restaurant  “I remember when it started. Frank wanted it to be an upmarket restaurant. They played soul music and the waiters and waitresses dressed in white suits and straw hats,” says one of Frank’s friends, 79-year-old Clive Phillip - or “Mashup” as locals call him. Notting Hill in the late 1960s was not the sought after address it is today. There were still undeveloped bomb sites from World War Two, many of the impressive white-rendered Victorian mansions had seen better days and an elevated concrete artery - the Westway motorway - was under construction, carving the area in two. But because accommodation was cheap, many Windrush migrants - people arriving in the UK between 1948 and 1971 from Caribbean countries - called the area home.

But because accommodation was cheap, many Windrush migrants - people arriving in the UK between 1948 and 1971 from Caribbean countries - called the area home.         “The Mangrove was the ‘go to’ place for black people in the area,” says Barbara Beese, one of the Mangrove Nine. She vividly remembers the spicy aroma of West Indian food wafting through the restaurant and the mural of mangrove trees on the wall. “Frank used to make the most wicked pineapple punch. My son was weaned on that juice,” she says. Barbara Beese The Mangrove served the best Caribbean food in the area, says Clive - who loved the spring chicken with rice and peas, followed by banana fritters. Maybe that was why it attracted an impressive array of A-listers. “Bob Marley would play football around the corner, or be at the music studio, and then pop over to the Mangrove for food,” says Clive. Jimi Hendrix, Diana Ross and Marvin Gaye - plus actress Vanessa Redgrave - all sampled the cuisine. But the Mangrove was, say Clive and Barbara, more than just a restaurant. It became a home from home for the Caribbean community - and a space for political discussion. When Clive arrived in “dismal and cold” London from Trinidad, he struggled. Low on money, unable to find work at the start, and fearful of white racist “Teddy Boy” thugs - he longed for community. Then the Mangrove opened and he felt at home. Clive Phillip “It was like a sanctuary. It was family, a base of support.” Barbara agrees. “There was good food, but there was way more to it. All Saints Road and the Mangrove were popularly known as ‘the frontline’. “People associate that term with drug dealing, but what I mean is that the Mangrove was the frontline of support for the black community. “They’d get advice on things like housing. Frank’s restaurant became the crucible for all of that.” But in December 1969, two days before Christmas, the restaurant was dealt a blow. The local council - Kensington and Chelsea - suddenly withdrew Frank’s licence to operate as an all-night cafe. The Mangrove had been open from 18:00 to 06:00 - with the bulk of trade after midnight. Frank was told he could now only offer takeaway food after 23:00. He complained, claiming to be the victim of unlawful discrimination. “The Mangrove was the ‘go to’ place for black people in the area,” says Barbara Beese, one of the Mangrove Nine.

Frank was told he could now only offer takeaway food after 23:00. He complained, claiming to be the victim of unlawful discrimination. One of the reasons given to Frank for his licence removal was that “people with criminal records, prostitutes, and convicted persons” used the Mangrove. “My restaurant is patronised by respectable people,” wrote Frank on the Race Relations Board complaint form. He also said his premises had been “unlawfully raided” by police on two occasions. With his new restricted licence, Frank felt he was under close scrutiny. Frank Crichlow in 1970 “Since the decision of the council, police cars have been outside the restaurant almost every night, I assume to check I am complying with the regulations,” he wrote in another letter in early 1970. “Not once did they ever find evidence of ‘drugs, pimps and prostitutes’ as one policeman said of us who inhabited the Mangrove,” recalls Barbara. She says the police appeared to resent the restaurant’s popularity - especially with its high profile customers. “To the police, Frank was a Trinidadian businessman gaining too much influence.” Clive says the police would turn up looking for drugs. “Everyone knew Frank was anti-drugs - you most certainly couldn’t go there if you had a reputation for being dodgy or selling weed. “It was harassment. It dragged the restaurant’s reputation down. They saw us black people as a threat.” In the following months, the police raids persisted. They were “harassing the black community with impunity”, says Barbara. Frank looked for support from the local Caribbean community and the newly-formed British Black Panthers anti-racist group - which was inspired by the radical political organisation, the Black Panther Party in the US. A group called “The Action Committee for the Defence of the Mangrove” was created and preparations for a protest march began. The Mangrove restaurant “We simply wanted to make visible our opposition to what was happening at the Mangrove,” says Barbara. The building quickly became a makeshift hub for community activism. “You had the restaurant upstairs, but downstairs people were busy preparing placards for the march,” says Clive. Before the protest, the Mangrove committee wrote an open letter to Prime Minister Edward Heath and others. It said the many “deliberate raids, harassments and provocations” by the police had been reported to the Home Office on many occasions but had fallen on deaf ears. “This protest is necessary as all other methods have failed to bring about any change in the manner the police have chosen to deal with black people.” One of the reasons given to Frank for his licence removal was that “people with criminal records, prostitutes, and convicted persons” used the Mangrove. “My restaurant is patronised by respectable people,” wrote Frank on the Race Relations Board complaint form. He also said his premises had been “unlawfully raided” by police on two occasions. With his new restricted licence, Frank felt he was under close scrutiny.

She says the police appeared to resent the restaurant’s popularity - especially with its high profile customers. “To the police, Frank was a Trinidadian businessman gaining too much influence.” Clive says the police would turn up looking for drugs. “Everyone knew Frank was anti-drugs - you most certainly couldn’t go there if you had a reputation for being dodgy or selling weed. “It was harassment. It dragged the restaurant’s reputation down. They saw us black people as a threat.” In the following months, the police raids persisted. They were “harassing the black community with impunity”, says Barbara. Frank looked for support from the local Caribbean community and the newly-formed British Black Panthers anti-racist group - which was inspired by the radical political organisation, the Black Panther Party in the US. A group called “The Action Committee for the Defence of the Mangrove” was created and preparations for a protest march began. The Mangrove restaurant “We simply wanted to make visible our opposition to what was happening at the Mangrove,” says Barbara. The building quickly became a makeshift hub for community activism. “You had the restaurant upstairs, but downstairs people were busy preparing placards for the march,” says Clive. Before the protest, the Mangrove committee wrote an open letter to Prime Minister Edward Heath and others. It said the many “deliberate raids, harassments and provocations” by the police had been reported to the Home Office on many occasions but had fallen on deaf ears. “This protest is necessary as all other methods have failed to bring about any change in the manner the police have chosen to deal with black people.” On Sunday 9 August 1970, just after lunchtime, a crowd started to gather in front of the Mangrove. It was mostly made up of Caribbeans, says Clive - people from Notting Hill, Brixton, Islington and all over London. About 14:45, according to police notes, there were 100 people there. Photos show demonstrators holding banners painted with phrases like “this is the time”, “black unity now” and “hands off us pigs”. The protesters had at least one pigs head - a derogatory nod at the police - which would be held aloft once they started marching. The crowd was growing impatient and Clive remembers activist Darcus Howe stood on the roof of a car to address everybody. “We’ve complained to the police about the police and nothing’s been done,” he said. “We’ve complained to magistrates about magistrates and nothing’s been done. We’ve complained to judges about judges and nothing’s been done. Now it’s time to do something ourselves.” Remembering her late father, Darcus’s daughter Tamara describes him as being “ferociously committed to fighting injustices”. “He was always very honest with me about the realities of racism. He was uncompromising on tolerating anything that was remotely racially unjust.”  Tamara Howe As Darcus spoke, says Clive, about a dozen police officers appeared from around the corner. Darcus pointed at them, and the crowd started shouting “pigs”. “Enough was enough - we had to stick up for the Mangrove,” says Clive. The protest had started.

The marchers, numbering as many as 150 by now, intended to walk past several police stations in the area. They were vastly outnumbered by police. A police document obtained by historian Paul Field - who co-wrote a biography of Darcus Howe - revealed that 588 constables, 84 sergeants, 29 inspectors and four chief inspectors had been made available to cover the protest. There was also a handful of plain clothes and Special Branch detectives. Barbara Beese holding a pig’s head The number of police officers is something Barbara saw as “ridiculous” - given the march was intended to be “jolly and good spirited”. Police logs give a minute-by-minute account of the march’s progress. Officers appear to have been unsure of where the protestors were planning to go. At one stage, an officer spotted a two-tone Volkswagen van in a nearby street and believed it to be “loaded with eggs” which may be “used by demonstrators”.

At one stage, an officer spotted a two-tone Volkswagen van in a nearby street and believed it to be “loaded with eggs” which may be “used by demonstrators”.   The Mangrove march snaked its way west and then north - underneath the now newly open Westway motorway, across the Grand Union Canal and into residential streets north of the main Harrow Road. “Things turned nasty as we walked down Portnall Road,” says Clive. Police notes say the procession stopped at about 16.40 and within two minutes there was serious fighting in Portnall Road and neighbouring streets. Officers were calling for assistance and ambulances. How the fighting started is unclear. “Some placards had pig heads on them,” says Clive. “That’s how we saw the police given how they treated us black people.” “I saw a police officer pull down a placard, while a few officers pinned the guy on the ground. “I could smell trouble.” Other witnesses gave different accounts. Police notes say a number of marchers “threw bricks from a builder’s skip and disorder ensued”. One witness, an elderly woman watching from her window, said that the riot started when a bottle was thrown at a policeman: “The police did not interfere until this occurred.” A retired postman described a misunderstanding on both sides. Police stopped the procession to let a car cross its path - he said - at which point “as quick as a flash” the march leaders “seemed to lose control”.

At 16:56, police reported that about 50 protestors had started to make their way back to the Mangrove restaurant - but scuffles continued in the streets around Portnall Road for another 20 minutes or so. By the end, 24 police officers had been injured and 19 arrests had been made. Nine individuals - including Barbara Beese, Darcus Howe and Frank Crichlow - were charged with incitement to riot and affray. But these initial riot charges were ​dismissed by the presiding magistrate through lack of evidence - says Paul Field - and because “police statements were thought to be contradictory”. One senior officer stated the “melee was spontaneous” and others claimed it was incited by the defendants in order to start a riot​. In total, 23 pages of police statements were ruled to be inadmissible by the magistrate. According to a Sunday Times report from early 1971, a central point to the prosecution’s case was that protesters had allegedly shouted and had banners stating: “Kill the pigs” - a Black Power anti-police slogan imported from America. The words were evidence of violence said prosecutors, but the magistrate disagreed. Despite this, the director of public prosecutions ended up reinstating the charges. Special Branch and Home Office documents indicate, says Paul Field, the move was a “deliberate strategy to target and discredit black power leaders”. The defendants were rearrested. The Mangrove Nine, as they were becoming known, got ready to defend themselves at the Old Bailey. A new BBC drama tells the story of the Mangrove Nine - one of five original films from Bafta and Oscar-winning director Steve McQueen. Each film in McQueen’s Small Axe anthology tells a different story from London’s West Indian community, where lives have been shaped - despite racism and discrimination - by personal determination. Watch Mangrove on BBC iPlayer now. Barbara Beese still remembers the atmosphere of the courtroom. “It was male, pale and stale,” she says. She was about 20 at the time and felt the room was physically very intimidating - with the judge positioned up high. “The Old Bailey was where the worst criminals went on trial, so for us to be there, it was like being told we were up there with murderers and rapists.” The strategic way the nine organised their defence is one of the reasons why the trial is considered so significant. “We took the trial issues head on,” recalls Barbara. “There was very little time to think about the emotional toll of it all. We’d spend all day in the Old Bailey and then meet for hours afterwards to debrief.” Barbara Beese, Frank Crichlow and Darcus Howe were joined in the dock by Rupert Boyce, Rhodan Gordon, Anthony Innis, Altheia Jones-LeCointe, Rothwell Kentish and Godfrey Millett. Darcus and Altheia took the bold decision to defend themselves. Darcus Howe in 2000 It meant they could speak directly to the jury, rather than going through the intermediary of a barrister. The prospect of black people defending themselves in court increased media attention. The next radical step was the demand, by Darcus, for an all-black jury - or a “jury of peers” - explains Paul Field. The judge was asked to consider an ancient precedent enshrined in the Magna Carta of 1215, which established the principle of the right to justice and a fair trial for all. “We never saw this as a fair trial and so we hoped an all-black jury would level the playing field,” says Barbara. She recalls how Altheia, Darcus and the defence barrister Ian MacDonald made legal arguments for two days. “Obviously the judge wasn’t going to have any of that,” she says. But even then, the defendants used their right to question and dismiss potential jurors. Among other things they were asked what they understood by the term “black power”. Sixty-three were rejected. The final selection included two black people. Flyer in support of the defendants In the coming weeks - the Kensington Post newspaper reported at the end of the trial - more than 50 witnesses would be called by the prosecution, and almost twice as many would be called by the defence. Barbara’s greatest concern was for her - and Darcus’s - baby son. “Part of the terror was thinking about what would’ve happened to him if we lost the case. I knew the response would have been vindictive in terms of punishment. And, as a black woman brought up in the care system, that’s the last thing I wanted to happen to my son.” A young teacher, Farrukh Dhondy - a new recruit to the Black Panther movement - was asked to take notes in court. “A lot of black people came to listen,” he says. “The word about Darcus’s oratory had spread.” “I would rush off to the Old Bailey after work. I would sit in the gallery every day for an hour or so and take notes.” Farrukh Dhondy Darcus and Farrukh were strangers at the time. In the years after, they became close friends. “Darcus was very theatrical and showed off like hell,” says Farrukh. Remembering Altheia, he says: “Whenever she spoke, you could hear a pin drop.” The trial ended on Thursday 16 December 1971. It wasn’t so much the result, as the closing remarks of the judge, that placed the Mangrove Nine in the history books. All the defendants were acquitted of the main charges of incitement to riot. Five were acquitted of all charges against them. The remaining four - Rupert Boyce, Rhodan Gordon, Anthony Innis and Altheia Jones-Lecointe - received suspended sentences for a selection of lesser offences, including affray and assaulting police officers. But it was Judge Edward Clarke’s closing comments that left a lasting mark. “What this trial has shown is that there is clearly evidence of racial hatred on both sides,” he told the courtroom. Perhaps it wasn’t so unusual, given the year, for the judge to suggest racism on the part of the defendants. The authorities and press had been accusing the Black Power movement of “anti-white racism” ever since US activist Stokely Carmichael’s visit to the UK in 1967. But more importantly, it was the first judicial acknowledgment of racism in the Metropolitan Police. “It was a big moment. Members of the jury even celebrated with us outside the Old Bailey,” says Barbara. For Farrukh, the ruling “sent a clear message to the British establishment to not go overboard with charging demonstrators.” The Met Police were not happy. “All the police officers who gave evidence were at great pains to explain they felt no personal antagonism towards black people within our community,” wrote one senior detective. “However, when directly questioned, one or two officers stated that they reserved personal views against certain individuals,” he continued. Senior officers sought, but failed, to get the judge to retract his comments. Barbara Beese still remembers the atmosphere of the courtroom. “It was male, pale and stale,” she says.

Senior officers sought, but failed, to get the judge to retract his comments. After the trial, one of the nine - Rothwell Kentish, faced a separate prosecution. As a result of his re-arrest in October 1970 - in relation to the Portnall Road violence - he was charged with the attempted murder of a police officer. He was eventually sentenced to 36 months for assault and possession of an offensive weapon. Rothwell “Roddy” Kentish died in 2019 aged 87. Joe Kentish with his father Rothwell  “The experience made my dad bitter,” says his 44-year-old son, Joseph. “In his last years, he had dementia and on his deathbed, all he spoke about was the [second] trial. “He kept asking us to find his court papers. I still feel a massive sense of injustice for him.” At Roddy’s funeral, a letter was read from the Mangrove Nine barrister, Ian MacDonald, acknowledging that he had borne perhaps the heaviest personal cost of the trial. Joseph says there’s even a doubt over whether his father was ever at the Mangrove march - with a suggestion he was fixing a car elsewhere. Joseph Kentish  “As a community leader, police obviously assumed that Dad would’ve had a hand in the march. “One thing I know is that the period our parents went through was deeply traumatic. They were brilliant and complex people who were deeply affected by those struggles.”  After the trial, one of the nine - Rothwell Kentish, faced a separate prosecution.

They were brilliant and complex people who were deeply affected by those struggles.”  The message to take from the Mangrove trial is, according to historian Paul Field, that racial discrimination cannot only be “defeated in protests on the streets, but also by black people organising their own defence in the courtroom”. The Mangrove Nine achieved an incredible feat, he says. They convinced a white-majority jury that the police had “stains of racism” and that the officers’ “trumped up allegations were without foundation”. But the struggle for racial equality is far from over, says Barbara. “We thought we were gonna change the world back then. But still, when you look at the disproportionate number of black men in custody and the general climate we find ourselves in, we have to keep on fighting.” In a statement, a Metropolitan Police spokesperson said: “All of society - of which policing is of course a part - has a role to play in reducing disproportionate outcomes in cases where disproportionality is found to be based on ethnicity alone. We continue to work with Londoners to find a way to police London that saves lives while retaining the confidence of our communities.” Barbara says black people may be better at defending themselves and calling to account actions of error, but “there are still issues of institutional racism within the police”. That thought is echoed by Leroy Logan, a black former police superintendent - who worked in the Met for 30 years. He gave evidence to the inquiry into the 1993 murder of black teenager, Stephen Lawrence - which labelled the force as “institutionally racist”. Leroy Logan “We did see improvements for a bit [after the 1999 Lawrence Inquiry], but there are still officers in the force who, for some reason, feel emboldened to have prejudices against black people.” But for Joseph Kentish - Rothwell’s son - there has been some progress over the years. “If you’re arrested in London, I do think that as a black man you’re still in serious danger of being hurt and stereotyped - but I don’t think you need to have the same level of fear as my dad.” The Met says it has come a long way since 1999, and is more scrutinised and accountable than it has ever been, but “appreciates some concerns remain”. “We do not believe our officers are prejudiced or ignorant - or carry out racist stereotyping,” said a spokesperson. “But that is not to say there are no areas for improvement. Of course there are, as there are in all organisations and institutions today.” The message to take from the Mangrove trial is, according to historian Paul Field, that racial discrimination cannot only be “defeated in protests on the streets, but also by black people organising their own defence in the courtroom”.

Her father, a writer and broadcaster who campaigned for black rights for more than 50 years, died in 2017. And what of the recent Black Lives Matter protests - following the death of George Floyd in the US? Are they channelling the spirit of the Mangrove? “It has been inspiring seeing people come out, telling it like it is,” says Tamara. “I’ve never seen anything like it before. And to be joined by white people? I feel really positive.” And from one who has spent a lifetime championing black lives - Barbara says she’s now filled with optimism.

Plans to ease Welsh indoor meeting rules postponed,"Since early last month two households have been able meet indoors Lockdown rules on meeting people indoors in Wales will not be relaxed this weekend, as previously suggested. However, up to four households - up from two - will be able to form an extended household from 22 August, as long as conditions ""remain stable"". First Minister Mark Drakeford said it was important not to jeopardise progress. He also said all hospitality businesses would have to collect customers' contact details to help tracing. Further enforcement measures are also being introduced to make sure businesses follow Covid-19 safety rules. Wales' test times under the microscope What do the stats tell us in Wales? How many people have died with covid in Wales? A fortnight ago Mark Drakeford said he ""would like to be able to offer more opportunities for people to meet indoors"" from 15 August. However he added this was""the most risky thing you can do""and now says he has now decided not to make any changes this weekend. Mr Drakeford was asked on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast why people can visit pubs, soft play areas and gyms indoors but not see more of friends and family in their own home. ""When people go to a pub or to a soft play area they are in a public place where there are clear rules laid down as to how people should behave in those settings, and there are people there to make sure that those rules are observed, and people are only in those settings for a relatively limited period of time,"" he said. ""Unfortunately what we have learnt is that when people meet inside their own homes, even people who are scrupulous about how they wanted to observe the rules, people tend to lapse into the way we all behave inside our own houses. ""Seventy per cent of all new infections in England are traced to household infections, people behaving inside their houses in ways that puts themselves and others at risk."" Mark Drakeford: ""We have made so much progress and we mustn't jeopardise this"" People in Wales can only meet up indoors if they are part of an extended household. Currently an extended householdcan only be made up of two households, but from next weekend the cap will increase to four. It will not be possible at that point to break up an existing extended household to form a new one, under the rules. Mr Drakeford said people now had a week to discuss what they should do. Issues to consider included ""how vulnerable people may be, who might need help the most, grandparents helping with children and childcare around the school day"", he said. ""That's why we decided we wouldn't introduce these changes until Saturday the 22nd of August, because it gives families the opportunity to have those conversations, and then to make the right choices, because once you've decided which households are to form your extended household, then that's how it has to be, you can't pick and choose and chop and change."" Also from next weekend a meal following a wedding, civil partnership or funeral will be allowed for up to 30 people indoors if social distancing can be maintained. Welsh Conservative Covid-19 recovery spokesman Darren Millar welcomed the new extended household regulations, but said people would be disappointed the rules on meeting indoors were not being relaxed. ""Many will find it extraordinary that they can meet up with other people indoors in a local cafe or restaurant with dozens of other people present, yet they can't call around for a panad [cup of tea] at someone's own home, mixing with far fewer people,"" he said. The first minister has also announced that new powers will be introduced on Monday requiring all hospitality businesses to collect customers' contact details. This will mean people ""can be contacted quickly by our test, trace, protect teams if they may have been exposed to coronavirus,"" Mr Drakeford said. Local authorities are already able to issue improvement or closure notices to businesses who are not complying with Covid-19 safety rules. Now the Welsh Government says any business issued with such a notice will have to display a sign. ""This pandemic is far from over and we all still have a duty to do our part to keep Wales safe,"" the first minister said. The Federation of Small Businesses Wales said it was ""very important"" those operating in the hospitality sector took on board the announcement it would be compulsory to implement contact tracing. ""This initiative will help trace any potential outbreaks, which will ultimately keep us all safe and keep businesses open,"" said its policy chairman Ben Francis. ""We want to ensure that small hospitality firms have the best possible chance at a safe, successful reopening and contact tracing is a vital part of that."" Since lockdown rules started to be lifted this is the first time Mark Drakeford has decided not to relax a restriction according to the timetable he had provisionally set out. He always warns that any changes are conditional on the spread of the virus at the time, but his tone was particularly cautious when he talked a couple of weeks ago about potentially allowing more people to meet inside from the 15th of August. Mr Drakeford claimed that was the ""most risky thing you can do"" and he would study the evidence carefully. He has now decided to wait a little longer before allowing a limited relaxation of the restrictions - a decision, it is said, guided by what has happened in other parts of the UK where local outbreaks have occurred. He says those spikes have been caused by people transmitting the virus indoors, and poor compliance by some businesses. That is why ministers here are also toughening their approach towards companies found to be flouting the rules.

Wilson reaches world snooker final in remarkable finish,"This video can not be played World Snooker Championship 2020: Kyren Wilson & Anthony McGill play thrilling final frame Betfred World Championship Venue:Crucible Theatre, SheffieldDates:31 July-16 August Coverage:Watch live on BBC One, BBC Two, BBC Four and Red Button, with uninterrupted coverage on BBC iPlayer, BBC Sport website and BBC Sport app.Full details and times. England's world number eight Kyren Wilson won an incredible final frame to beat Anthony McGill 17-16 and reach his first World Championship final. Scottish qualifier McGill was one frame from victory at 16-15 but Wilson drew level to set up a decider. McGill conceded 35 points after missing a snooker eight times, then Wilson went in-off twice as fortunes fluctuated. Wilson fluked the green and struggled to contain his emotions as he edged the frame 103-83 after 62 minutes. Seven-time champion Stephen Hendry, commentating on BBC Two, described the frame - the longest of the championship - as ""the most bizarre end to a World Championship match I've seen"". Wilson, who will face Ronnie O'Sullivan in the final, said: ""It's a cruel game. I've dreamt of this moment but I didn't want to get there like this. ""I held myself together right up until the end of that decider. It's just mad what can happen on a snooker table. ""I felt like it was one of the best semi-finals ever at the Crucible. I felt it was such a good standard, I'm just annoyed that it ended that way."" McGill added: ""I feel as though I played really well. I don't feel as though I have done anything wrong. I feel like it has been stolen from me, not by Kyren but by the snooker gods."" Full tournament schedule and results BBC coverage times and channels This video can not be played Analysis: 'Never see a frame like that again' The astonishing 33rd frame will live long in the memory and go down as an all-time Crucible classic. Both players missed chances in a nervy frame and the two were separated by a single point with one red remaining, but then Wilson got McGill in a brilliant snooker. Following his numerous misses on the red, McGill needed a snooker to get back, which he got as Wilson went in-off from the following shot. The pair attempted the final red into the middle by playing the cue ball off the baulk cushion. McGill got it, but then lost position on the green and a long tactical battle ensued. Further incredible drama followed as Wilson fluked the green leaving McGill needing snookers and he dropped his head and seemingly broke down in tears at the table, apologising to his opponent for his fortune. Wilson snatched the pink to end the most dramatic frame of the tournament. 1991 world champion John Parrott on BBC Two: I have never, in 44 years of playing this wonderful game, seen a frame of snooker like that. It was unbelievable. There were so many talking points in it. I thought I was watching a basketball match. It was 90 plays 60 at one point. We will never see a frame like that again. When you put all those balls on a table things can happen that are so bizarre, but I have never seen anything like that. Six-time world champion Steve Davis: Kyren is a very lucky boy to get through that in the end. He played a great snooker to put Anthony in trouble with the misses. The ball over the middle pocket was just stupid and they had their chances both of them. The fluke was massive. Kyren over-hit the shot, so he was risking leaving everything on. It was incredible and he was nearly crying knowing he had nearly won. The emotional rollercoaster both players have been through in that last frame is enough to last a lifetime. So many shots could and may have gone differently. In the end somebody had to win it and Kyren fell over the line. Wilson received a bye into the second round after opponent Anthony Hamilton withdrew on the eve of the tournament with health concerns and ousted defending champion Judd Trump in the quarter-finals. He started the final session on Friday with a superb 94 break but McGill responded with a hardworking 84, before punishing his opponent for missing two tricky blacks off the spot with nerveless runs of 87 and 122. McGill split the balls after potting the blue, but inadvertently sent a red into the corner pocket, allowing Wilson to capitalise with an 82 under pressure. The pair continued to trade blows as the Glaswegian responded by levelling once more at 15-15 and taking the next with another cool 98 break to go one from victory. Wilson needed a couple of chances to pinch a re-racked 32nd frame and take the semi-final into a deciding frame.

Senedd committee recalled over A-level results,"Education Minister Kirsty Williams met students at Merthyr College on results day The Welsh Government's handling of exam results is to be ""urgently"" examined by a Senedd committee amid criticism over the grading of A-levels. Students have accused the Welsh Government of ""abandoning them"" after 42% of grades were lowered by the exams watchdog. As head teachers described the results as ""unjust"", the Senedd's education committee has been recalled. But First Minister Mark Drakeford has said it was ""a record year"" for pupils. ""The big picture is we have more students achieving, more students achieving at the very top end of the scale, and a record number of people from Wales accepted into university,"" he told BBC Wales. The handling of the results system has seen the Labour government come under fire from head teachers and some of its own backbenchers, who said some pupils had got results two grades lower than predicted. This video can not be played Bradley Desmier was predicted a B, C and a merit but got a D, E and a pass The Welsh Parliament is on its summer break, but the Children, Young People and Education Committee will now meet on Tuesday. Chair Lynne Neagle said decision-makers must explain what happened to provide ""clarity"", ahead of the publication of GCSE results next week. ""Young people's well-being, and their ability to plan for their future learning and careers, will be at the centre of our work looking at these issues,"" she said. ""We recognise that these matters are complex and will need detailed, longer term consideration. However, we believe that there is an important role for us to play now, to ask questions which will ensure that a fair and clear approach is adopted and communicated to the Welsh people as quickly as possible."" Exams were cancelled after schools were closed in March Mike Hedges, Labour member of the Senedd for Swansea East, had said he knew of pupils receiving a lower than predicted grade ""without any samples of their work being checked"". But Mr Drakeford told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast: ""I read what people said, and I don't agree that it was strong criticism."" Labour MS for Aberavon David Rees has backed calls for a ""full review"" to examine whether poorer areas have been more affected by the grading system than more affluent areas. ""The robust and fair quotes that the government is talking about is of course consistency across Wales, but I do not believe that that has actually been fair to individuals,"" he told BBC Radio Wales. ""These are young people whose futures are on the line."" Unfair results claim after grades lowered Minister makes pledge on this year's grades Exams were cancelled this summer due to the coronavirus pandemic, with results based on teacher estimates. But 42% were downgraded by exams watchdog,Qualifications Wales, after it judged the grades were ""too generous"". On Wednesday, Education Minister Kirsty Williams promised that students would be guaranteed a grade no lower than they achieved at AS-level. But with the last-minute intervention coming after results had already been sent to schools and colleges, there are concerns that universities may judge applications on the grades already issued, before that revision takes effect. In an open letter to Ms Williams, 16 members of the Welsh Youth Parliament also called for action. Welsh Youth Parliament member Jonathan Powell says students feel ""abandoned"" A-level student and Wrexham youth parliament member Jonathan Powell said: ""Not only have you abandoned thousands of students who did not have a chance to sit their exams, but you have demonstrated a lack of respect and trust in teachers across the nation."" He said he had been predicted to achieve A* and A grades, but was awarded a single A grade and Bs. ""How is it justifiable that A*s are brought down to Bs?"" he asked. Abbie Cooper, 17, from Cwmbran is another member of the youth parliament who signed the letter. She said her predicted AS-level grades were downgraded from three Bs to an unclassified and two D grades. ""It kind of feels like they just got a number generator or a letter generator and given you a grade based on that,"" she said. ""It sucks because I need these to apply for university next year because these are my predicted for university. How can I go anywhere with these?"" She said it had left her felling ""distraught"" and she would now be appealing the results. Natalie Johns said her future was decided by people who did not know her work or what she could and had achieved When Natalie Johns opened her A-level results on Thursday, the results were not what she was predicted. The 18-year-old's teachers had calculated she would get all A*s, meaning she would meet the requirements of her conditional offer to study psychology at Cambridge University. But when she opened her results at Y Pant School, in Rhondda Cynon Taff, her results had been lowered to one A* in biology, with As in maths and psychology. The teenager had a desperate 24 hours after her chosen college said they could not accept her, and she was put in a ""summer pool"" waiting to see if another college would let her in. But she has since had the good news she has been accepted after her school and MP got involved, but said she would still be fighting to get the grade changed. ""It is not important right now, but these A-level results are going to stick with me for life - if I am going for a job, it's not going to have a sticker next to it saying the grade is because of Covid-19,"" she said. ""It was such a let down, that this is how we were treated and how our [school] education came to an end."" Natalie said she was angry with the Welsh Government for their response to students' concerns. ""They are almost bragging about how you can't go lower than your AS grade, but you can't get an A* at AS-level,"" said Natalie. ""For high achievers wanting to go on to study medicine and other subjects, it really matters. It's the injustice of it."" Some pupils were pleased with their results Head teachers in north Wales said the way results were allocated was ""unfair"" and ""impossible to fathom"", saying their own teachers' estimates had been done with ""professionalism and fairness"". The Federation of North Wales Secondary School Head Teachers said many universities had lowered their offers due to a shortage of international students during the pandemic. But while that meant many students would be able to attend their university of choice, the A-level grades would be ""with them for the rest of their lives"". Claire Armitstead, head teacher of Rhyl High School, said the system had generated ""numerous inconsistencies"". ""It can never be forgotten that every inconsistency is a child whose life has been turned upside by an algorithm and this cannot be allowed to happen,"" she said. ""It is unjust and immoral and our children deserve better."" Geraint Parry, head teacher at Ysgol Brynhyfryd, in Ruthin, Denbighshire, said: ""Students have been disregarded, downgraded and simply told 'computer says no'."" Ellen Williams, head of Llanrug's Ysgol Brynrefail, Gwynedd, said the grading system had ""resulted in many of our young people's lives being devastated"". Plaid Cymru's leader also urged Mr Drakeford to ensure pupils in Wales awarded lower grades received their predicted results instead. In a letter to the first minister, Adam Price said this should also apply to next week's GCSE results ""and this should be communicated to learners today, for peace of mind"". Mr Price pointed to comments from the UK Labour leader Keir Starmer, who has said ministers in Englandmust follow the lead of Scotland and allow teacher assessed marks to be accepted. But Wales' first minister said Mr Starmer was referring to the position in: ""England, where they don't have AS-levels; England where you have to pay for an appeal; England where people will be kept waiting for longer for results than they have here in Wales. ""Our position is very different."" A pupil from Swansea checking her results on Thursday A Welsh Government spokesman said about 94% of the grades were the same or within one grade of those students were predicted to achieve. ""This is before any adjustments are made as a result of the AS [level] floor announced yesterday by the minister for education,"" he added. ""We have also asked Qualifications Wales to consider whether the grounds for appeal can be broadened for all A-level, AS-level and GCSE qualifications and we expect to provide more information on this next week. ""No student from Wales should be disadvantaged against other UK students. ""We are pleased that, following the publication of the results today, UCAS have reported the highest number of Welsh learners being offered a place at university since 2011.""

Thanks for joining us. Today's live page writers were: George Bowden, Joshua Cheetham, Jo Couzens, Sophie Morris and Francesca Gillett. The page was edited by Thomas Spender and Alex Therrien. Weâll soon be bringing our live page to a close, but before we go here are the main developments from today:  Oman is ending its night-time curfew as the country
continues to ease coronavirus restrictions. The ban on night-time movement will end from 15
August at 05:00 local time (02:00 BST). The curfew meant that people had to stay at home from
21:00 until 06:00. It had already been shortened as part of the lockdown
easing. Previously, people had to stay at home between 19:00 and 07:00. Oman has recorded 557 deaths and 82,743 cases,
according to data from Johns Hopkins university. Greencore workers who have tested positive for coronavirus have been told to self-isolate Earlier this week, we reported on the outbreak at a food factory in England, where nearly 300 workers tested positive. The factory in Northampton makes sandwiches for store M&S. Officials have said the outbreak was due to behaviour outside of work, such as car sharing and socialising. Now, the leader of the local council has said the outbreak is a ""huge disaster"" for the town. ""I believe if we follow guidelines as stringently as we can, we can still avoid a lockdown,"" said Jonathan Nunn. ""Let's be absolute honest, the [Greencore] outbreak is absolutely dreadful."" Northampton has become top of the list of highest weekly rates in England. The town's rate rose to  115.8 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 11 August - up from 34.7 in the previous seven days to 4 August. Read more on the sandwich factory outbreak here. ""An extra two weeks off of work is just not doable,"" says Tom Today we've been bringing you the stories of some of the people who are rushing to get back to the UK from holidays in France before 04:00 BST tomorrow. After that point,everyone returning from France will have to self-isolate. Tom Duffell, who runs a small business, decided to cut short his family holiday to Nice by four days and booked a last-minute flight home. ""We were enjoying a nice cocktail last night and suddenly a news flash pops in and a scramble to book flights,"" he told the BBC from the airport. ""I think we've managed to get my wife and one of my sons on one flight and myself and my other son on another flight. ""We've had to spend about Â£800 because we just can't afford to take two extra weeks off of work,"" added Tom, whose wife works as an NHS nurse and volunteered in an intensive care ward. He said the government should have given tourists already in France longer to prepare. ""They could have said, you know, give tourists 72 hours to return to the UK, rather than just over 24 hours and there's this mad scramble,"" he said. ""Instead we're all packed into the airport. There's huge queues, social distancing's gone out of the window."" ""We're all scrambling on to the same flight, the flights are all full. Surely that's not going to help public health, that's just going to make things worse."" Alison RobertsPortugal Correspondent, Lisbon The Portuguese Communist Party
(PCP) is preparing to receive up to 33,000 people a day at its three-day annual
festival next month. It announced the move today
after talks this week with the health authorities over precautions to prevent
the spread of the coronavirus. The party's insistence on going
ahead with the event from 4 to 6 September has come under fierce criticism in
recent weeks, as health officials struggle to bring a series of coronavirus
outbreaks in Greater Lisbon under control. The Festa do Avante! is staged
on a 30-hectare site in Amora, across the River Tagus from Lisbon, that can
normally host up to 100,000 people. It attracts music lovers who come for the
local and foreign performers as well as party members. It is a crucial source
of revenue for the party. The PCP promised that organisers would ensure ""additional protection and
prevention measures, extending still further the safety conditions guaranteed
to its visitors"". For each visitor there would be ""an area greater
than that established for beaches and which, as a rule, will be double that
which is fixed for similar spaces"" outdoors, it said. Yesterday's edition of Avante!
(Forwards), the party newspaper for which the festival is named, called on
anyone planning to go along to take a mask with them, since it will be needed
for some spaces on the site, but did not say whether masks would or would not
be required throughout. In Portugal, the wearing of
masks is currently compulsory on public transport and closed public spaces, but
not outdoors. The minority socialist
government has resisted calls to stop the event from going ahead, at a time
when all this year's music festivals have been cancelled. Speaking yesterday,
the minister of health said that Portugal's constitution forbids the banning of
political initiatives, but that there can be no exceptions to rules in place
for the pandemic. Eleven new coronavirus deathswere announced by the UK government today,,externaltaking the total to 41,358. These
are deaths for any reason within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. Meanwhile, the total number of people who have tested positive has increased by 1,441. That's an upward trend since two weeks ago. Earlier this week the government announced it was changing the way coronavirus deaths in England are counted. That change was applied retrospectively, and reduced the overall UK death toll by more than 5,000. You can read more about the new counting method here. And to find out more about how many confirmed cases there are in the UK and your area,click here. The country has seen another rise in cases France has recorded 2,846 new covid infections over
the past 24 hours - the highest number since lockdown restrictions were eased. The seven-day moving average has increased to 2,041
marking the first time it has surpassed 2,000 since 20 April. Franceâs total number of cases since the pandemic
began now stands at 212,211. It comes as the UK prepares to enforce a 14-day
quarantine period topeople
arriving from France from 04:00 on Saturday. Thousands of holidaymakers are racing to return to
the UK in order to avoid the need to self-isolate. Birmingham has seen a rise in its Covid-19 infection rate Pub landlords breaking the rules around coronavirus in Birmingham are facing a police crackdown for failing to properly record customers' details. It comes amid growing concern among health chiefs about arising
infection rate in Birmingham, which puts it behind only Sandwell- the worst-affected local authority area in the West Midlands to date. Birmingham had a rate of 23.6 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 10 August with the trend increasing,according to NHS Digital,external. City council leader Ian Ward urged businesses to contact Public Health England as soon as they identified either a confirmed or suspected case of Covid-19 among staff or customers. Waheed Saleem, the West Midlands deputy police and crime commissioner, said: ""We will work closely with the licensing authorities to crack down on those premises that don't follow rules and are breaking rules."" Mr Saleem also warned organisers of illegal parties and raves, and those thinking of attending them: ""We will not tolerate these gatherings."" Under new restrictions bars in Athens will have to close at midnight Greeceâs Prime Minister, Kyriakos
Mitsotakis, has hit out at the countryâs young people as the country records a
rise in cases. The prime minister said âthe
spread of the virus is linked to younger agesâ as he asked people returning from
overseas to wear masks for a week after arriving back in the country and stay
away from vulnerable people. âI want to make a special appeal
to our youth. I too have children of that age,â he said. âPleaseâ¦ take care of
yourselves, you are not immune, and your parents and grandparents are
especially not immuneâ. New restrictions have been
announced in the country. Restaurants and bars will have to close from midnight
until 07:00 (04:00) in Athens, Thessaloniki and the islands of Mykonos, Santorini,
Corfu, Rhodes and Crete. The country recorded 254 cases
on Friday. Yo! Sushi has announced it will close 19 restaurants and cut 250 staff as part of a company-wide restructure. The company is launching a company voluntary arrangement, allowing it to shut loss-making sites. It said the current climate and ""changes in consumer behaviour"" meant that rents at some restaurants were unsustainable. The company's boss, Richard Hodgson, said: ""Like the rest of the sector, we need to take decisive action to adapt to the lasting changes that the covid pandemic has brought about."" Read more All 186 members of staff at Fyffes will be tested for coronavirus after 10 tested positive People in Coventry have been urged ""not to drop their guard"" after a slight rise in coronavirus cases in the region and an outbreak at a workplace in the suburb of Walsgrave. Some10
members of staff at fruit wholesalers Fyffes Group Ltd tested positive for the
virus this week- now all 186 staff are set to be tested as a precaution while the site remains open. It is the second known outbreak at a Coventry workplace this month, following nine positive cases among staff at Tesco Arena Park at the start of August. At 13.8 per 100,000 population, the number of cases for the seven West Midlands Combined Authority areas climbed slightly in the seven days up to and including 6 August. However, it is still significantly lower than rates in the worst-hit parts of the country. Council leaders at Coventry, Birmingham, Sandwell, Solihull, Dudley, Walsall and Wolverhampton have joined forces to stress the need for continued vigilance to reduce the risks of a further significant spike and local lockdown. They urged people to adhere to social distancing, in particular ahead of the return of thousands of students for the new university term. Norway has issued new
advice for mask wear in a response to a rise in cases. It is now recommended that
people using public transport in the capital, Oslo, and the region of Indre Ostfold wear
masks during rush hour. The guidance is not mandatory
and is for when people cannot maintain a one metre distance. Those travelling from the
airport after returning from countries where people must isolate have also been
advised to wear a face covering. People working in places where face-to-face
interactions cannot be avoided have also been advised to wear masks, according
to Reuters news agency. The guidance will be in place
for two weeks, Health Minister Bent Hoie said during a press conference on
Friday. Norway is one of a few countries
that had not advised people to wear masks in public. Countries such as France,
Spain and Belgium have all introduced mandatory mask policies. The ATP Tour Finals, a competition
that ends the menâs tennis season, is set to take place in London behind closed

Prof Ndeye Coumba TourÃ© Kane works on Senegal's Covid-19 testing frontline. She told the BBC about the sacrifices it takes her to fulfil her role as the scientific director at a major research centre in Dakar, the country's capital city. This video can not be played Coronavirus: Challenges of working on Senegal's Covid-19 frontline The number of daily positive tests for coronavirus in the UK is the highest it's been since 14 June, according to the latest government figures. In the 24-hour period up to 09:00 BST, there were a further 1,441 lab-confirmed cases. Overall, a total of 316,367 cases have been confirmed. Some 41,358 people have died in the UK within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19, as of today, government figures show. This is up by 11 from Thursday. Previously, people in England who died at any point following a positive test, regardless of cause, were counted in the figures. A review of how these deaths were counted has reduced the UK death toll by more than 5,000. Separate figures published by the UK's statistics agencies indicate there have been 56,800 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. There are concerns that hospitals will be overstretched if the pandemic coincides with the flu season The head of the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) says many regions in the country need to bring down
the number of coronavirus cases in order to stop the pandemic from coinciding with the
countryâs flu season. Director Robert Redfield said the rate of positive
test results as a proportion of the total number of tests should be below 5% or even lower,according
to Bloomberg,external. More than 30 states have reported test
positivity rates of more than 5% over the past week. There are concerns that if the
pandemic and the winter flu season coincide, hospitals could be overstretched. The CDC estimates,externalthat there were 410,000â740,000 flu hospitalisations and
24,000â64,000 deaths during the 2019-2020 winter flu season. The North Korean leader has called for the country's borders to be tighter Kim Jong-un has
ordered North Korea to reject all offers of international aid in the wake of
severe flooding, saying that it could expose people to the coronavirus. The North Korean
leader was quoted in state media telling a meeting of top officials that the countryâs
borders should be shut more tightly. North Korea says it
has no confirmed cases of the virus however health experts say they find this
difficult to believe. On Friday, a lockdown was lifted in the town of Kaesong after a suspected case of the virus. It was not announced if the suspected case was in fact Covid-19. The country has been
hit by weeks of heavy monsoon rains. More than 20 people have died and
16,000 houses have been destroyed. Oxford University'sWorcester College has confirmed it will give places to all students who were offered them,external, ""irrespective of their A-level results"". In a statement on its website, it explained the decision was taken ""in response to the uncertainties surrounding this yearâs assessment"". It said their new 2020 undergraduates are their ""most diverse cohort ever"". It comes after 280,000 pupils in England had their A-level marks downgraded, with many set to miss out on their university places. After the exams were cancelled due to the pandemic, grades were awarded using a controversial modelling system - with the key factors being the ranking order of pupils and the previous exam results of schools and colleges. This produced more top grades than has ever been seen before in A-levels - almost 28% getting A* and As - buthead teachers have been
angry about ""unfathomable"" individual injustices in the downgrading
of some results. You can get out of your car for a break in a remote area - but not in a service station or on a ferry If you have a holiday in a country which is exempt from UK
quarantine rules and donât make any stops in France on your drive back, you are not required to self-isolate on
your return to the UK. However, you must make sure no new people get into your
vehicle. The countries
which share a border with France and are currently exempt from quarantine rules
are Germany, Italy and Switzerland. All Franceâs
other neighbours - Spain, Andorra, Monaco, Luxembourg and Belgium
- are not exempt. So, if you have visited one of these countries during your
holiday, you will still have to self-isolate, even if you have made no stops
while driving through France. You can stop in a
remote place in France, for example to stretch your legs or walk your dog, and
if you donât have any contact with other people or enter any public spaces you
will not have to quarantine for 14 days when you get back. But if you get
out of your vehicle at a service station or on ferry while crossing from France
to the UK, you will be required to self-isolate on your return. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Wilson reaches world snooker final in remarkable finishKyren Wilson beats qualifier Anthony McGill 17-16 to reach his first World Championship final.BBC SportComments,"This video can not be played World Snooker Championship 2020: Kyren Wilson & Anthony McGill play thrilling final frame Betfred World Championship Venue:Crucible Theatre, SheffieldDates:31 July-16 August Coverage:Watch live on BBC One, BBC Two, BBC Four and Red Button, with uninterrupted coverage on BBC iPlayer, BBC Sport website and BBC Sport app.Full details and times. England's world number eight Kyren Wilson won an incredible final frame to beat Anthony McGill 17-16 and reach his first World Championship final. Scottish qualifier McGill was one frame from victory at 16-15 but Wilson drew level to set up a decider. McGill conceded 35 points after missing a snooker eight times, then Wilson went in-off twice as fortunes fluctuated. Wilson fluked the green and struggled to contain his emotions as he edged the frame 103-83 after 62 minutes. Seven-time champion Stephen Hendry, commentating on BBC Two, described the frame - the longest of the championship - as ""the most bizarre end to a World Championship match I've seen"". Wilson, who will face Ronnie O'Sullivan in the final, said: ""It's a cruel game. I've dreamt of this moment but I didn't want to get there like this. ""I held myself together right up until the end of that decider. It's just mad what can happen on a snooker table. ""I felt like it was one of the best semi-finals ever at the Crucible. I felt it was such a good standard, I'm just annoyed that it ended that way."" McGill added: ""I feel as though I played really well. I don't feel as though I have done anything wrong. I feel like it has been stolen from me, not by Kyren but by the snooker gods."" Full tournament schedule and results BBC coverage times and channels This video can not be played Analysis: 'Never see a frame like that again' The astonishing 33rd frame will live long in the memory and go down as an all-time Crucible classic. Both players missed chances in a nervy frame and the two were separated by a single point with one red remaining, but then Wilson got McGill in a brilliant snooker. Following his numerous misses on the red, McGill needed a snooker to get back, which he got as Wilson went in-off from the following shot. The pair attempted the final red into the middle by playing the cue ball off the baulk cushion. McGill got it, but then lost position on the green and a long tactical battle ensued. Further incredible drama followed as Wilson fluked the green leaving McGill needing snookers and he dropped his head and seemingly broke down in tears at the table, apologising to his opponent for his fortune. Wilson snatched the pink to end the most dramatic frame of the tournament. 1991 world champion John Parrott on BBC Two: I have never, in 44 years of playing this wonderful game, seen a frame of snooker like that. It was unbelievable. There were so many talking points in it. I thought I was watching a basketball match. It was 90 plays 60 at one point. We will never see a frame like that again. When you put all those balls on a table things can happen that are so bizarre, but I have never seen anything like that. Six-time world champion Steve Davis: Kyren is a very lucky boy to get through that in the end. He played a great snooker to put Anthony in trouble with the misses. The ball over the middle pocket was just stupid and they had their chances both of them. The fluke was massive. Kyren over-hit the shot, so he was risking leaving everything on. It was incredible and he was nearly crying knowing he had nearly won. The emotional rollercoaster both players have been through in that last frame is enough to last a lifetime. So many shots could and may have gone differently. In the end somebody had to win it and Kyren fell over the line. Wilson received a bye into the second round after opponent Anthony Hamilton withdrew on the eve of the tournament with health concerns and ousted defending champion Judd Trump in the quarter-finals. He started the final session on Friday with a superb 94 break but McGill responded with a hardworking 84, before punishing his opponent for missing two tricky blacks off the spot with nerveless runs of 87 and 122. McGill split the balls after potting the blue, but inadvertently sent a red into the corner pocket, allowing Wilson to capitalise with an 82 under pressure. The pair continued to trade blows as the Glaswegian responded by levelling once more at 15-15 and taking the next with another cool 98 break to go one from victory. Wilson needed a couple of chances to pinch a re-racked 32nd frame and take the semi-final into a deciding frame.

"Oxford college 'will honour UK A-level offers'The college says it has confirmed students' places ""irrespective of their A-level results"".","Worcester College, Oxford said it had offered places to its ""most diverse cohort ever"" An Oxford college has said it will honour all places it offered to UK students, irrespective of their A-level results. Therehas been anger amongschools, colleges and students since Thursday when 40% of awarded A-level gradeswere lower than teachers' predictions. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the results were a ""robust set of grades"". Worcester College said it had given offers to its ""most diverse cohort ever"" before exams were cancelled. There has been widespread concern about the fairness of the ""calculated"" results In England, 36% of entries had a lower grade than teachers predicted and 3% were down two grades after exams were cancelled due to the coronavirus pandemic. School and college leaders are calling for a review and have said all fees for appeals should be waived. However, the overall results, across England, Northern Ireland and Wales, show record highs for A* and A grades. Astatement on the website of Worcester College,external, which has about 700 students, said: ""Many members of our college community and beyond have expressed their concern for the potential impact of yesterday's A-level results on this year's incoming students. ""At Worcester we made offers in 2020 to our most diverse cohort ever, and in response to the uncertainties surrounding this year's assessment, we have confirmed the places of all our UK offer-holders, irrespective of their A-level results."" How have my exam results been decided this year? A-level results: 'My future has been set back completely' What's next in the arguments over exam results? Staff at another Oxford college, which has not confirmed places, told the BBC they had been ""flooded with emails"" from concerned alumni that deserving students could lose out. An open letter to the university, signed by more than 2,700 alumni, called for all colleges to make offers unconditional, with deferred entry where courses were full. The letter, organised by two Balliol College graduates, said: ""Brilliant pupils from economically disadvantaged schools have seen their dreams dashed - while others from wealthy backgrounds saw their predicted grades confirmed."" Organisers Hannah O'Rourke and Liam Whitton said the government's ""discriminatory algorithm... operates on an assumption that individuals cannot transcend their backgrounds"". This year's A-level results are higher than even before, with record highs for A* and A grades The prime minister has said pupils would be able to sit exams in the autumn if they felt they ""could have done better"" or felt there had been ""an injustice"". He added: ""But looking at the big picture, I think overall we've got a very robust set of grades, plus you've got the situation in which more pupils than ever before are getting their first choice course at university and more kids from disadvantaged backgrounds going to university.""

Yo! Sushi to shut restaurants and cut 250 jobs,"Yo! Sushi has announced it will close 19 restaurants and cut 250 staff as part of a company-wide restructure. The company is launching a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), allowing it to shut loss-making sites. It said the current climate and ""changes in consumer behaviour"" meant that rents at some restaurants were unsustainable. Yo!'s boss Richard Hodgson said: ""While we have already taken measures to reduce costs, rents remain an issue. ""In the current climate, it's just not viable for us to keep any sites that no longer perform."" The company also said the CVA will mean it can exit nine sites where it no longer operates but is still responsible for the rent. Yo! Sushi currently has 59 restaurants and 10 concessions in the UK. It hasadapted its conveyor beltdelivery system to make diners feel safer in its restaurants in the age of coronavirus. The company is taking part in the government's 'eat out to help out' scheme, which gives people a discount of up to Â£10 per head if they dine at a restaurant between Monday and Wednesday during August. However, Mr Hodgson said: ""Like the rest of the sector, we need to take decisive action to adapt to the lasting changes that the covid pandemic has brought about."" ""While it's been a very difficult decision to make and I am very sorry that it will mean losing many of our team members, a CVA has become an essential measure to secure our business for the future, and enable us to protect as many jobs as possible."" Meanwhile, the retail sector continues to haemorrhage jobs with River Island announcing that it will cut 350 store management and senior sales roles. It adds to 250 jobs River Island said would be lost at its head office. Earlier this week,Debenhams said it would axe 2,500 roles. That is on top of 4,000 job cuts the department store announced in May.

Plans to ease Welsh indoor meeting rules postponedOutbreaks elsewhere linked to people meeting in homes mean changes will not now happen on Monday.Wales politicsComments,"Since early last month two households have been able meet indoors Lockdown rules on meeting people indoors in Wales will not be relaxed this weekend, as previously suggested. However, up to four households - up from two - will be able to form an extended household from 22 August, as long as conditions ""remain stable"". First Minister Mark Drakeford said it was important not to jeopardise progress. He also said all hospitality businesses would have to collect customers' contact details to help tracing. Further enforcement measures are also being introduced to make sure businesses follow Covid-19 safety rules. Wales' test times under the microscope What do the stats tell us in Wales? How many people have died with covid in Wales? A fortnight ago Mark Drakeford said he ""would like to be able to offer more opportunities for people to meet indoors"" from 15 August. However he added this was""the most risky thing you can do""and now says he has now decided not to make any changes this weekend. Mr Drakeford was asked on BBC Radio Wales Breakfast why people can visit pubs, soft play areas and gyms indoors but not see more of friends and family in their own home. ""When people go to a pub or to a soft play area they are in a public place where there are clear rules laid down as to how people should behave in those settings, and there are people there to make sure that those rules are observed, and people are only in those settings for a relatively limited period of time,"" he said. ""Unfortunately what we have learnt is that when people meet inside their own homes, even people who are scrupulous about how they wanted to observe the rules, people tend to lapse into the way we all behave inside our own houses. ""Seventy per cent of all new infections in England are traced to household infections, people behaving inside their houses in ways that puts themselves and others at risk."" Mark Drakeford: ""We have made so much progress and we mustn't jeopardise this"" People in Wales can only meet up indoors if they are part of an extended household. Currently an extended householdcan only be made up of two households, but from next weekend the cap will increase to four. It will not be possible at that point to break up an existing extended household to form a new one, under the rules. Mr Drakeford said people now had a week to discuss what they should do. Issues to consider included ""how vulnerable people may be, who might need help the most, grandparents helping with children and childcare around the school day"", he said. ""That's why we decided we wouldn't introduce these changes until Saturday the 22nd of August, because it gives families the opportunity to have those conversations, and then to make the right choices, because once you've decided which households are to form your extended household, then that's how it has to be, you can't pick and choose and chop and change."" Also from next weekend a meal following a wedding, civil partnership or funeral will be allowed for up to 30 people indoors if social distancing can be maintained. Welsh Conservative Covid-19 recovery spokesman Darren Millar welcomed the new extended household regulations, but said people would be disappointed the rules on meeting indoors were not being relaxed. ""Many will find it extraordinary that they can meet up with other people indoors in a local cafe or restaurant with dozens of other people present, yet they can't call around for a panad [cup of tea] at someone's own home, mixing with far fewer people,"" he said. The first minister has also announced that new powers will be introduced on Monday requiring all hospitality businesses to collect customers' contact details. This will mean people ""can be contacted quickly by our test, trace, protect teams if they may have been exposed to coronavirus,"" Mr Drakeford said. Local authorities are already able to issue improvement or closure notices to businesses who are not complying with Covid-19 safety rules. Now the Welsh Government says any business issued with such a notice will have to display a sign. ""This pandemic is far from over and we all still have a duty to do our part to keep Wales safe,"" the first minister said. The Federation of Small Businesses Wales said it was ""very important"" those operating in the hospitality sector took on board the announcement it would be compulsory to implement contact tracing. ""This initiative will help trace any potential outbreaks, which will ultimately keep us all safe and keep businesses open,"" said its policy chairman Ben Francis. ""We want to ensure that small hospitality firms have the best possible chance at a safe, successful reopening and contact tracing is a vital part of that."" Since lockdown rules started to be lifted this is the first time Mark Drakeford has decided not to relax a restriction according to the timetable he had provisionally set out. He always warns that any changes are conditional on the spread of the virus at the time, but his tone was particularly cautious when he talked a couple of weeks ago about potentially allowing more people to meet inside from the 15th of August. Mr Drakeford claimed that was the ""most risky thing you can do"" and he would study the evidence carefully. He has now decided to wait a little longer before allowing a limited relaxation of the restrictions - a decision, it is said, guided by what has happened in other parts of the UK where local outbreaks have occurred. He says those spikes have been caused by people transmitting the virus indoors, and poor compliance by some businesses. That is why ministers here are also toughening their approach towards companies found to be flouting the rules.

Labour call for urgent U-turn over 'exams fiasco',"There has been widespread concern about the fairness of the 'calculated' results Labour has called on ministers to act immediately to sort out an ""exams fiasco"" in England and stop thousands of A-level students being ""betrayed"". It said it was unacceptable that a ""flawed system"" had led to 280,000 pupils having their marks downgraded. Sir Keir Starmer said ministers must follow the lead of Scotland and allow teacher assessed marks to be accepted. Ministers say this risks ""grade inflation"" and disadvantaged pupils had not been disproportionately affected. But some Tory MPs have challenged the fairness of how grades have been decided. Schools North East, representing over 1,100 schools in the north east of England, also backed the use of teacher assessments. Why did the A-level algorithm say no? Anger over 'unfair' A-level results What's next in the arguments over exam results? Oxford college will uphold offers despite A-level grades But they said if that was not possible there needed to be a much more rapid and transparent way for schools to appeal, saying that using mock grades or relying on autumn exams was inadequate. In London a group of protestors gathered outside 10, Downing Street to express their anger at the results while petitions, calling for more weight to be given to teacher assessments, gained tens of thousands of signatures. Protestors angry at the exam grading system gathered outside 10, Downing Street on Friday After exams were cancelled due to the pandemic, grades were awarded using a controversial modelling system, with the key factors being the ranking order of pupils and the previous exam results of schools and colleges. This produced more top grades than have ever been seen before in A-levels, with almost 28% getting A* and As, but head teachers have been angry about ""unfathomable"" individual injustices in the downgrading of some results. This year's A-level results are higher than even before In England, 36% of entries had grades lower than their teacher assessments and 3% were down two grades. There are now calls to switch away from this system and to use teacher assessments, in the way that the government U-turned in Scotland. But England's exam watchdog Ofqual has warned that using teachers' estimates would have artificially inflated results - and would have seen about 38% of entries getting A*s and As. Labour said the lack of consistency in individual results was ""heartbreaking"" for those affected and the government was squarely to blame for sticking with a ""fatally flawed results system"". ""Across the last 24 hours the scale of the injustice has become clear,"" said Sir Keir. ""Young people and parents right across the country, in every town and city, feel let down and betrayed. ""The unprecedented and chaotic circumstances created by the UK government's mishandling of education during recent months mean that a return to teacher assessments is now the best option available,"" said the Labour leader. ""No young person should be at a detriment due to government incompetence."" Labour's education spokeswoman Kate Green also called for appeals to be able to be made by individual students, not only through schools. The Equalities and Human Rights Commission has urged the exams regulator Ofqual to consider the equality impacts of all their actions and mitigate against any potential negative affect on disadvantaged and minority groups. EHRC Chief Executive, Rebecca Hilsenrath, called on the watchdog to publish a full breakdown of the differences between teacher assessed grades and the final grade. ""Students who have been downgraded must be able to appeal directly if they believe their grades are unfair,"" she said. Figures from Ofqual showed independent schools had disproportionately benefited from the rise in top grades - up by five percentage points, compared with two percentage points for comprehensives and 0.3 percentage points for further education colleges. Northern Ireland: Minister must act 'decisively' on exam results Wales: Labour backbench revolt against A-level downgrading The chairman of the Education Select Committee, Tory MP Robert Halfon, urged Ofqual to ""explain properly how their model has worked and whether it has been fair"". Mr Halfon also said exam appeals ""should be no cost"" to students. Writing on his website, the former children's minister Tim Loughton said the results had been ""extraordinarily distressing"" for some students and urged ministers to ""look at the algorithm again for those who have missed out on their place in further education"". Another, Tory MP. Robert Syms, asked the government to ""go on teacher recommendation"" arguing that grade inflation would be less unfair than failing students who did not have the chance to take exams. And Conservative Peer, Lord Porter of Spalding, called the process for awarding grades ""shambolic"" and said it made him ashamed to be a member of the party. Lord Porter also criticised fees for appeals which can be more than Â£100 for an unsuccessful appeal. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has defended what he said were a ""robust set"" of grades and said that pupils who believed they were treated unfairly would be able to appeal or, if they wanted, sit exams in the autumn. Schools can appeal for an upgrade if their pupils' mock grades were higher than their allocated results. But the exam regulator Ofqual has still to say how a mock exam result can be validated - and head teachers have warned that mocks are not standardised or taken by all pupils, and could not be used as a fair way of deciding final exam results. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Transport Minister Grant Shapps rejected suggestions this year's exam system had been tougher on students from poorer backgrounds. ""More students from disadvantaged backgrounds are going to university and overall we've got more accepted to university than previously as well,"" said Mr Shapps. The latest figures from the Ucas admissions service do not show any significant increase in students deferring for a year. There will still be places to be decided through clearing, but so far almost 430,000 places have been accepted. What's next in the arguments over exam results?

Thousands return to UK to beat France quarantine,"This video can not be played British holidaymaker at Calais: ""We cancelled our holiday to come home"" Thousands of holidaymakers have rushed back to the UK in a bid to avoid quarantine measures imposed on France, which came into force on Saturday. The 14-day isolation requirement from 04:00 BST also applied to people arriving from the Netherlands, Monaco, Malta, Turks and Caicos, and Aruba. Eurotunnel trains sold out on Friday and air travellers faced steep prices, but some ferries increased capacity. France warned it would take ""reciprocal measures"". The Netherlandswarned against all but essential travel to the UK,externalonce the restrictions came into force on Saturday, but it said it will not introduce reciprocal measures. The countries were targeted for quarantine restrictions because their infections rates exceeded 20 cases per 100,000 people over seven days, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said. I'm in France right now - what do I do? Lockdown to ease further in England from Saturday European countries fight coronavirus surge He told BBC Breakfast on Friday that there were about 160,000 British holidaymakers in France, and said ""the last thing we want to do is to have people returning and bringing the infection with them"". The deadline left many travellers in a frantic rush for plane, train or ferry tickets costing hundreds of pounds. Eurostar passengers arriving at St Pancras on Friday evening, having beaten the quarantine deadline Tom Duffell, who runs a small business, cut short his holiday to Nice - with his wife and two children - by four days and booked a last minute flight home. ""We were enjoying a nice cocktail last night and suddenly a news flash pops in and a scramble to book flights,"" he said on Friday. ""We've had to spend about Â£800 because we can't afford to take another two weeks off work."" He added that social distancing had ""gone out of the window"" in the scramble for transport, with ""huge queues"" at the airport. Stephanie Thiagharajah, who returned to Kent from France, criticised the ""manic"" way the quarantine had been imposed and said the ""risky"" move had created ""a huge amount of people coming at the same time"". Some ferry companies added extra services amid the rush to return to the UK Eurotunnel said 12,000 people tried to book tickets for its Channel Tunnel trains in the hour after the new rules were announced at about 22:00 BST on Thursday - compared with just hundreds normally. It increased its capacity on Friday but trains sold out, and the companywarned people not to travel to its terminal without a confirmed booking. The shuttle service was running between 90 minutes and two hours late from Calais by Friday evening. Eurotunnel spokesman John Keefe told the BBC traffic at the terminal in Calais was running smoothly all day. This video can not be played BBC journalist made a video diary as her family had to cut short their holiday ""There were no huge queues.  Many people seem to have decided to stay in France,"" he said. Prices of some flights to the UK from Paris were more than Â£450, compared to Â£66 on Saturday. Many direct flights from the south of France were sold out. The cheapest Eurostar tickets were Â£210, compared with Â£165 on Saturday. One couple, Stuart and Anna Buntine, spent nearly Â£1,000 to make it back to the Midlands via Eurostar from Burgundy, central France. P&O Ferries told the BBC it had increased its capacity on its Spirit class ships. And DFDS Ferries said it had added an extra four departures from Calais to help Britons return in time. By Anna Holligan, BBC News foreign correspondent There is no visible sense of panic inside Schiphol airport, Amsterdam, as the final call before quarantine approaches. Passengers bobbed up the escalators towards the check-in desks no faster than usual, I saw no queues or people pleading to be sold an empty seat. Conor Wells and his friends had saved up and treated themselves to a post-lockdown break Conor Wells and his friends said they were conscious of the rising infection rates in Amsterdam before they set off but as they were only staying for a couple of nights, they thought they'd make it back before anything changed. ""We didn't think they'd give us a day's notice to get out. It came in so fast..."" Martin Walter shakes his head as he scans the departures board. Heading home 24 hours early has cost them more than an entire holiday. They couldn't afford to stay on and skip fourteen days of work upon return. ""At least we got a seat,"" Eva Povey rolls her eyes. ""It's a lose-lose situation..."" Scott and Tracy Cuthbert have been on holiday in France with their daughter Milly Scott and Tracy Cuthbert, from Oxfordshire, said cutting their holiday in France short by six days was an ""easy decision to make"" because they need to work. The couple and their daughter Milly, 16, began ""frantically packing"" after they heard news of the rule changes. The family booked themselves onto a ferry for Friday afternoon, only to realise they wouldn't make it to the port in time - so booked another ferry, due to leave Calais at 20:30 BST. ""We're driving up now and the sat nav says we'll have about an hour's leeway,"" Scott said from the car. Read more as holidaymakers weigh up whether to cut trips short On Friday, France reported 2,846 new coronavirus cases in 24 hours - the highest number since lockdown restrictions were eased. The seven-day average increased to 2,041, marking the first time it has surpassed 2,000 since 20 April. Clement Beaune, France's secretary of state for European affairs,tweeted that the UK's decision was a matter of ""regret"" for the French,external, but that he was hoping for a ""return to normal as soon as possible"". The travel industry, already damaged by the pandemic, also criticised the move. Gloria Guevara, president of the World Travel and Tourism Council, said the UK was lagging behind other countries that had ""shunned quarantines"" in favour of ""comprehensive"" testing programmes for everyone departing and arriving back into their respective countries. The UK's ambassador to France, Lord Llewellyn,acknowledged that the new quarantine rule would be ""unwelcome news"" for Britons in the country,external, but stressed that people could continue with their holidays as long as they follow safety precautions and self-isolate on their return. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said while the Labour Party supports ""evidence based measures"" at the border, it was ""vital"" that No 10 had a ""joined-up strategy"" and ""urgently"" puts in place a specific deal to support the heavily impacted travel sector. He added: ""That the government has still not put in place an effective track, trace and isolate system has made matters far worse and made it more likely that we are reliant on the blunt tool of 14-day quarantine."" This video can not be played How do I quarantine after returning from abroad? According to the data company Statista, people from the UK paid10.35 million visits to France,externallast year, putting it second behind Spain - with 18.12 million - in terms of popularity. The Foreign Office is now warning against all but essential travel to France. The quarantine measure was imposed for Spain on 25 July. What are the rules in France and other parts of Europe? How will the world vaccinate seven billion people? You finally got abroad, but was it worth it? A list of more than 50 so-called travel corridors - allowing movement between the UK and the other countries without the need to self-isolate on return - waspublished at the start of last monthand later expanded. But the ending of some of the exemptions on the list follows a ""significant change"" in the risk of contracting Covid-19, the Department for Transport said. It added that there had been a 66% increaseâ¯in newly reported cases per 100,000 people in France since last Friday. For the Netherlands, it was up 52%. And the increase for Malta was 105%, while it was 273% for Turks and Caicos and 1,106% for Aruba. Ahead of a government meeting on the new measures, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised to be ""absolutely ruthless"" in deciding on rules for holidaymakers from abroad. ""We can't be remotely complacent about our own situation,"" he added. According to the Home Office, a total of nine fines have been introduced at the border since quarantine restrictions were introduced on 8 June. Under the rules, people who do not self-isolate can be fined up to Â£1,000 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and Â£480 in Scotland. There are fines up to Â£5,000 for persistent offenders. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic Meanwhile, the government has announced that maximum fines for people in England who repeatedly refuse to wear a face covering could double to Â£3,200, while organisers of illegal raves could face a Â£10,000 penalty. But from Sunday, indoor theatre, music and performance venues will be able to reopen with socially distanced audiences.

Two households can join up in Wales,"This video can not be played First Minister Mark Drakeford says the changes will support those caring for others Two households in Wales will be able to form one ""extended household"" to meet indoors and stay overnight from next Monday, the Welsh Government has said. First Minister Mark Drakeford said it means grandparents ""will be able to see and hold their grandchildren again"". People can only be in one extended household, which cannot be changed once arranged. Travel restrictions are due to be lifted the same day. It follows similar ""support bubble"" arrangements elsewhere in the UK. Can I be in a coronavirus 'social bubble'? Covid 'support bubbles' begin in England and NI What is a support bubble? The changes will mean people can have physical contact, exercise, cook and eat together, and also stay in each other's homes. There is no limit to the number of people that can be in the two households. But, under the rules, if anyone in an extended household develops symptoms the entire household will need to self-isolate. The Welsh Government has asked people to keep records to help with contact tracing if that happens. Two households will be able meet indoors from Monday People shielding can also be included but the first minister warned that if they join an extended household it ""will increase their risk of being exposed"" to coronavirus. Mr Drakeford said: ""Creating extended households will enable many families to be reunited for the first time since March. ""Grandparents will be able to see and hold their grandchildren again. ""It will help support many working parents with informal childcare over the summer months and it will also support those who are caring for others."" Jan Maddox in Newport has been apart from Nigel Swaby in Tamworth since the day before lockdown. Jan Maddox, 71, has been living alone in Newport since March and has not been able to see her partner Nigel Swaby, who lives in a village near Tamworth. ""Virtually for the last three months I've been walking up and down the road,"" she said. ""It's the same houses, its the same hedgerows, it's the same everything."" Ms Maddox said the changes will be a ""game-changer"" for her, and if the travel restrictions end on 6 July she said her partner would ""pick me up and he's going to take me back to the Midlands"". This video can not be played Two homes in Wales will be able to link up from Monday Mr Drakeford said extended households means that in some cases ""especially in larger families, this may mean making some difficult choices."" The first minister asked viewers of the daily Welsh Government press conference to ""think about the risks"". ""Think about the consequences - if anyone in the extended household becomes ill, everyone will have to isolate for 14 days,"" he said. ""For some people this will have a greater impact than for others, and needs to be thought about carefully."" The moves coincide with plans to end Wales' stay local rules on 6 July if cases continue to fall, and follows the opening of non-essential retail last week. The moves come into force next week If the changes result in any ""flare ups"" the Welsh Government will be able to ""make a connection between cause and effect"", Mr Drakeford said. ""We make the changes on the basis of advice and the advice is always that these steps are proportionate and shouldn't lead to a further acceleration in the spread of coronavirus."" The first minister said he did not have the ""detail in front"" of him when he was asked how it would impact people in houses of multiple occupation. Mr Drakeford said further guidance will to be published later this week. The Welsh Conservatives welcomed the news but questioned why it could not have been announced last Friday ""to prevent another lost weekend"". Angela Burns, health spokeswoman, said: ""So many families in Wales need such a boost after so long apart, and so if there is science behind why the decision could not have been announced on Friday, then the First Minister should put it into the public domain."" Every time there's an announcement on lifting a lockdown restriction, it's accompanied at some point with guidance notes explaining the finer details. On extended households, those guidance notes will be awaited more keenly than usual because there's a lot we still don't know. The first minister said that extended households would be required to keep records to help track and trace contacts in the event that a member develops Covid. It's not clear what the nature of those records will be. Will extended households have to register and provide contact information? Will they have to keep records of meetings? What happens if they don't? Another big question is what happens to people who rent rooms in shared houses or older people in care homes. Will they be allowed to participate in the extended household scheme and if so how will that work? In Englandhouseholds of any sizewill be able to meet indoors or outside from 4 July. It does not need to be the same set of households. The groups are expected to maintain social distancing, unless they are part of the same support bubble. That is where people living alone can stay with other households -measures also in place in Northern Ireland. The Welsh Government has not used the word bubbles, instead using the term ""extended households"" also seen inScotland. There, extended households are limited to a household meeting another which has just one person alone, or only with children under 18. Who can you have in your bubble?

I'm in France now - what do I do?,"People coming to the UK from France and several other countries are now being forced to quarantine for 14 days. France, the Netherlands, Monaco, Malta, Turks and Caicos, and Aruba have been removed from the UK government'slist of countries exempt from quarantine rules.,external The rules for the new additions to the list, including France, came into effect at 04:00 BST on Saturday 15 August. If you arranged your own earlier flight or ferry ticket home before the measures took effect, it is extremely unlikely you will be able to claim the cost back from an insurer or anyone else, our personal finance reporter Kevin Peachey says. In the unlikely event that your flight back was cancelled and the airline placed you on an earlier flight, then you should not be out of pocket, he adds. Where can I go on holiday without having to quarantine? You finally got abroad, but was it worth it? Anyone arriving to the UK has to complete apassenger locator form,externalgiving their passport information and details about where and when they have travelled. All travellers - including UK nationals - coming from countries that are not exempt from quarantine must provide the address where they will be staying. When you arrive in the UK you will need to self-isolate for 14 days. Self-isolating means remaining at home or the place you are staying - and not leaving it.So you cannot go shopping or meet friends, and any exercise you do must be in your home or private garden, if you have one. What are the UK quarantine rules? People can be fined Â£100 for failing to fill in a form with these details. One in five eligible passengers will be called or texted to check they are following the rules. People who do not self-isolate can be fined up to Â£1,000 in England, Wales and Northern Ireland and Â£480 in Scotland. There are fines up to Â£5,000 for persistent offenders. If the new rules will affect your ability to work when you return to the UK, it could mean having to cancel your trip. In cases where only quarantine rules are changed, you are unlikely to be able to get your money back from tour operators, airlines or hotels.

Pubs ignoring Covid rules could be forced to shut,"Businesses that flout coronavirus could be told to improve, or be forced to shut Businesses including bars and restaurants could be forced to shut if they ignore rules to contain coronavirus under new powers. Hospitality businesses were allowed to open indoors in Wales from Monday. But International Relations Minister Eluned Morgan said pubs and restaurants must collect customer details and maintain social distancing. She threatened action to enforce the rules, and said new powers would come into force this week. Mrs Morgan also told customers they can only meet members of their household, or their extended household bubble, while indoors at pubs and restaurants. Under new powers councils will be able to issue improvement notices to businesses if they do not take measures required. If they ignore that - or if there is a clear and serious breach of the rules - they could be told to close. This video can not be played Eluned Morgan said action may need to be taken if actions threatened other people's health. Ms Morgan warned pubs, cafes, restaurants and hotels that they ""must"" follow rules to avoid the spread of coronavirus if they are to stay open. ""You must maintain physical distancing on your premises and - if you are a hospitality business - you should capture your customers' contact details,"" she said. Customers should raise the matter with the venue if they are not asked for their details, and should only gather indoors in pubs, cafes and restaurants with members of their extended household, she said. Pubs and restaurants toast reopening inside Call to tackle 'unacceptable' Cardiff Bay trouble Parents' relief as free childcare resumes She said the Welsh Government, councils and the police can ""take action if some people's behaviour becomes a threat to other people's health"". ""Changes to those powers this week will mean that this includes closing premises if this is necessary,"" she added. Cardiff restaurateur and pub owner Cerys Furlong has raised concerns about social distancing at some businesses. She said she had seen premises with chairs and tables not spaced out, and said customers had told her about not having their details taken. Hospitality firms are being asked to take customer details should they be needed for contact tracing. A ""small minority"" of businesses not taking account of Welsh Government guidance ""are not only putting the health and safety of their staff and customers at risk"" but also the ""future operations"" of sensible businesses that are, she said. ""If we are forced into a second lockdown because of reckless behaviour from the minority, then thousands more jobs will be lost, and businesses will close permanently,"" Ms Furlong added, speaking on behalf of the Welsh Independent Restaurant Collective.

Your holiday refund rights,"The newly identified Omicron variant of Covid has led to more disruption for international travellers. Quarantine is being reintroduced for people arriving from some African countries, flights have been cancelled and PCR tests will be mandatory within 48 hours of arrival to the UK from 30 November. If the government announces that travel to a particular country is not advised, then airlines and travel companies are likely to cancel any pre-booked flights or holidays there. For example, that is already the case for some flights to and from South Africa as a result of risks associated with the Omicron variant. What are the UK's new travel rules? If your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a full refund and you can choose to receive that refund in cash rather than as a voucher. An airline should refund the money within seven days, although some people have waited longer. A package holiday should be refunded, in full, within 14 days. This is far less clear-cut. If you cancel, rather than your travel provider, then you have no automatic right to a refund. In this situation, it is worth contacting the airline/holiday provider to see what options you have. EasyJet, for example, has announced that it will extend its ""freedom to change"" service - which allows passengers to change flights up to two hours before departure for free  - until 31 March, 2022. Some may charge a fee to transfer to another date or destination, but some may allow it without charging a fee. You would have to pay the difference if the alternative flight is more expensive. They may give you a voucher, or they may allow you to cancel and get a refund. That may be trickier, according to Rory Boland, travel editor at Which? who said that the property's specific policy will determine whether refunds would be given. ""If your trip is several weeks or months away, travellers should at this stage do nothing as the situation may change,"" he said. ""Those booking a trip should do so through holiday providers with good, flexible booking policies in case it cannot go ahead."" People who have booked a package holiday will be refunded in full, including accommodation, if it is cancelled by the operator. Operators do not have to refund you if you are unexpectedly forced to self-isolate. It is best to study their policies before booking, or see whether they can offer some support if you have already booked and want to cancel. Travel insurers are offering different levels of cover. In part, this depends on how much you pay for a policy. The majority, but not all, will pay out if you test positive for Covid and have to cancel before you travel. Importantly, if the Foreign Office advises against travel to a country - as it is for some in southern Africa at the moment, then all but a handful of travel insurance policies would be invalid if you still decide to go. Rules are inevitably going to be complex, given the risk of Covid varies so much between countries. The government haspublished a charter,externalthat ""clearly sets out consumer rights and responsibilities when booking travel while Covid-19 measures remain in place"". It says it expects travel operators to be ""flexible"" with customers, given the circumstances, and theCompetition and Markets Authority (CMA) has warned package holiday firmsthey must stick to refund rules. â¨ How are travel rules being relaxed?

'Abandoned' students demand A-levels rethink,"Education Minister Kirsty Williams met students at Merthyr College on results day The Welsh Government's handling of exam results is to be ""urgently"" examined by a Senedd committee amid criticism over the grading of A-levels. Students have accused the Welsh Government of ""abandoning them"" after 42% of grades were lowered by the exams watchdog. As head teachers described the results as ""unjust"", the Senedd's education committee has been recalled. But First Minister Mark Drakeford has said it was ""a record year"" for pupils. ""The big picture is we have more students achieving, more students achieving at the very top end of the scale, and a record number of people from Wales accepted into university,"" he told BBC Wales. The handling of the results system has seen the Labour government come under fire from head teachers and some of its own backbenchers, who said some pupils had got results two grades lower than predicted. This video can not be played Bradley Desmier was predicted a B, C and a merit but got a D, E and a pass The Welsh Parliament is on its summer break, but the Children, Young People and Education Committee will now meet on Tuesday. Chair Lynne Neagle said decision-makers must explain what happened to provide ""clarity"", ahead of the publication of GCSE results next week. ""Young people's well-being, and their ability to plan for their future learning and careers, will be at the centre of our work looking at these issues,"" she said. ""We recognise that these matters are complex and will need detailed, longer term consideration. However, we believe that there is an important role for us to play now, to ask questions which will ensure that a fair and clear approach is adopted and communicated to the Welsh people as quickly as possible."" Exams were cancelled after schools were closed in March Mike Hedges, Labour member of the Senedd for Swansea East, had said he knew of pupils receiving a lower than predicted grade ""without any samples of their work being checked"". But Mr Drakeford told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast: ""I read what people said, and I don't agree that it was strong criticism."" Labour MS for Aberavon David Rees has backed calls for a ""full review"" to examine whether poorer areas have been more affected by the grading system than more affluent areas. ""The robust and fair quotes that the government is talking about is of course consistency across Wales, but I do not believe that that has actually been fair to individuals,"" he told BBC Radio Wales. ""These are young people whose futures are on the line."" Unfair results claim after grades lowered Minister makes pledge on this year's grades Exams were cancelled this summer due to the coronavirus pandemic, with results based on teacher estimates. But 42% were downgraded by exams watchdog,Qualifications Wales, after it judged the grades were ""too generous"". On Wednesday, Education Minister Kirsty Williams promised that students would be guaranteed a grade no lower than they achieved at AS-level. But with the last-minute intervention coming after results had already been sent to schools and colleges, there are concerns that universities may judge applications on the grades already issued, before that revision takes effect. In an open letter to Ms Williams, 16 members of the Welsh Youth Parliament also called for action. Welsh Youth Parliament member Jonathan Powell says students feel ""abandoned"" A-level student and Wrexham youth parliament member Jonathan Powell said: ""Not only have you abandoned thousands of students who did not have a chance to sit their exams, but you have demonstrated a lack of respect and trust in teachers across the nation."" He said he had been predicted to achieve A* and A grades, but was awarded a single A grade and Bs. ""How is it justifiable that A*s are brought down to Bs?"" he asked. Abbie Cooper, 17, from Cwmbran is another member of the youth parliament who signed the letter. She said her predicted AS-level grades were downgraded from three Bs to an unclassified and two D grades. ""It kind of feels like they just got a number generator or a letter generator and given you a grade based on that,"" she said. ""It sucks because I need these to apply for university next year because these are my predicted for university. How can I go anywhere with these?"" She said it had left her felling ""distraught"" and she would now be appealing the results. Natalie Johns said her future was decided by people who did not know her work or what she could and had achieved When Natalie Johns opened her A-level results on Thursday, the results were not what she was predicted. The 18-year-old's teachers had calculated she would get all A*s, meaning she would meet the requirements of her conditional offer to study psychology at Cambridge University. But when she opened her results at Y Pant School, in Rhondda Cynon Taff, her results had been lowered to one A* in biology, with As in maths and psychology. The teenager had a desperate 24 hours after her chosen college said they could not accept her, and she was put in a ""summer pool"" waiting to see if another college would let her in. But she has since had the good news she has been accepted after her school and MP got involved, but said she would still be fighting to get the grade changed. ""It is not important right now, but these A-level results are going to stick with me for life - if I am going for a job, it's not going to have a sticker next to it saying the grade is because of Covid-19,"" she said. ""It was such a let down, that this is how we were treated and how our [school] education came to an end."" Natalie said she was angry with the Welsh Government for their response to students' concerns. ""They are almost bragging about how you can't go lower than your AS grade, but you can't get an A* at AS-level,"" said Natalie. ""For high achievers wanting to go on to study medicine and other subjects, it really matters. It's the injustice of it."" Some pupils were pleased with their results Head teachers in north Wales said the way results were allocated was ""unfair"" and ""impossible to fathom"", saying their own teachers' estimates had been done with ""professionalism and fairness"". The Federation of North Wales Secondary School Head Teachers said many universities had lowered their offers due to a shortage of international students during the pandemic. But while that meant many students would be able to attend their university of choice, the A-level grades would be ""with them for the rest of their lives"". Claire Armitstead, head teacher of Rhyl High School, said the system had generated ""numerous inconsistencies"". ""It can never be forgotten that every inconsistency is a child whose life has been turned upside by an algorithm and this cannot be allowed to happen,"" she said. ""It is unjust and immoral and our children deserve better."" Geraint Parry, head teacher at Ysgol Brynhyfryd, in Ruthin, Denbighshire, said: ""Students have been disregarded, downgraded and simply told 'computer says no'."" Ellen Williams, head of Llanrug's Ysgol Brynrefail, Gwynedd, said the grading system had ""resulted in many of our young people's lives being devastated"". Plaid Cymru's leader also urged Mr Drakeford to ensure pupils in Wales awarded lower grades received their predicted results instead. In a letter to the first minister, Adam Price said this should also apply to next week's GCSE results ""and this should be communicated to learners today, for peace of mind"". Mr Price pointed to comments from the UK Labour leader Keir Starmer, who has said ministers in Englandmust follow the lead of Scotland and allow teacher assessed marks to be accepted. But Wales' first minister said Mr Starmer was referring to the position in: ""England, where they don't have AS-levels; England where you have to pay for an appeal; England where people will be kept waiting for longer for results than they have here in Wales. ""Our position is very different."" A pupil from Swansea checking her results on Thursday A Welsh Government spokesman said about 94% of the grades were the same or within one grade of those students were predicted to achieve. ""This is before any adjustments are made as a result of the AS [level] floor announced yesterday by the minister for education,"" he added. ""We have also asked Qualifications Wales to consider whether the grounds for appeal can be broadened for all A-level, AS-level and GCSE qualifications and we expect to provide more information on this next week. ""No student from Wales should be disadvantaged against other UK students. ""We are pleased that, following the publication of the results today, UCAS have reported the highest number of Welsh learners being offered a place at university since 2011.""

Teenage killer of teaching assistant jailed,"Lindsay Birbeck's body was found in a grave at Accrington Cemetery, 12 days after she disappeared A teenager who killed teaching assistant Lindsay Birbeck and buried her body in a cemetery has been jailed. Rocky Marciano Price, 17, was caught on CCTV pulling a wheelie bin with Mrs Birbeck's body inside before she was found in a shallow grave 12 days later. Price, who previously could not be named,was convicted of her murderon Wednesday. Mrs Birbeck, 47, was found dead at Accrington Cemetery on 24 August 2019 after a major police search. Her family had initially thought she had had an accident while on a walk, but as the search progressed they feared the worst. At Preston Crown Court the judge, Mrs Justice Yip, jailed Price for life, with a minimum tariff of 16 years in custody. Early in their investigation of the case, police released crucial CCTV footage of Price pulling the wheelie bin ""The attack was swift and brutal. I am sure the defendant lay in wait with the intention of killing a passing woman,"" she said. ""Why he decided to kill her only he knows. If it had not been Lindsay Birbeck, it could have been someone else. ""This was the entirely random killing of a stranger."" Price's trial heard how Mrs Birbeck left her home in Accrington for a walk to a nearby wooded area known as the Coppice. The defendant, 16 at the time, had been prowling in the woods looking for lone females and is thought to have killed her shortly after she entered the Coppice, the jury was told. His victim was later discovered wrapped in two plastic bags in the makeshift grave, after she went missing on 12 August. A post-mortem examination concluded Mrs Birbeck died from neck injuries, which could have been applied through stamping or kicking, or kneeling on the front of the neck, a court heard. An attempt had also been made to cut off a leg, possibly with a saw. Price, who was only named when court restrictions were lifted on Thursday, targeted Mrs Birbeck when she entered the Coppice After police issued the CCTV clip of a young male pulling a blue wheelie bin behind him on Burnley Road, Price's parents took him to a police station, where he was arrested. The teenager, of Whinney Hill Road, Accrington, later admitted dragging the bin from the Coppice on 17 August, with Mrs Birbeck's body inside, across Burnley Road to the cemetery. Teenage murderer named as judge lifts restrictions Teaching assistant 'may have known her killer' Murder accused 'could be easily led' Price, who has autism and learning difficulties, had claimed to police he had in fact buried the body for a stranger, who had promised him ""a lot of money"". However, a jury unanimously rejected his account that the mystery man had offered him a large cash reward if he disposed of a body. Mrs Justice Yip said that while Price's autism had a significant impact on his communication skills and reduced his capacity for empathy, it certainly did not cause him to be violent. Mrs Birbeck, 47, left her house on Burnley Road to go for a walk but never returned ""In my judgment, the defendant's mental disorder cannot in any way excuse, or even explain, his actions,"" she said. ""I have no doubt he knew what he was doing when he killed Lindsay Birbeck and that he knew that killing her was terribly wrong. ""His actions after the killing clearly suggest he had the capacity to plan and reason. ""The defendant was also capable of putting forward a story which, while incredible, was designed to explain the evidence against him."" Jurors returned their verdict exactly a year after Mrs Birbeck, a mother-of-two, was last seen alive. Her daughter Sarah, 17, said it was ""unforgivable"" Price had not admitted his guilt and spared her family the pain of a trial. ""My mum was a higher level teaching assistant and the irony is she would have taught boys like the defendant and would have tried her best to help him,"" she said, in a statement read to the court. ""To know now that he murdered her for absolutely no reason is heart-breaking and has not sunk in yet."" Lindsay Birbeck's children Steven, left, and Sarah, second from right, told the court they are ""grateful that justice has been served"" Her daughter recalled how the family initially believed she might have had an accident while out walking. ""But, once mountain rescue had done their search I think deep down I knew it was going to be something bad,"" she said. ""My mum would not leave us out of choice, I knew that."" Det Insp Tim McDermott, from Lancashire Police, said Mrs Birbeck ""lost her life needlessly,"" adding ""we may never know why because not only did Price deny killing her, he claimed he moved her body for a man he didn't know"". ""This was a lie which thankfully, the jury saw straight through,"" he said. Why not follow BBC North West onFacebook,external,Twitter,externalandInstagram,external?

YO! Sushi to shut restaurants and cut 250 jobs,"Yo! Sushi has announced it will close 19 restaurants and cut 250 staff as part of a company-wide restructure. The company is launching a company voluntary arrangement (CVA), allowing it to shut loss-making sites. It said the current climate and ""changes in consumer behaviour"" meant that rents at some restaurants were unsustainable. Yo!'s boss Richard Hodgson said: ""While we have already taken measures to reduce costs, rents remain an issue. ""In the current climate, it's just not viable for us to keep any sites that no longer perform."" The company also said the CVA will mean it can exit nine sites where it no longer operates but is still responsible for the rent. Yo! Sushi currently has 59 restaurants and 10 concessions in the UK. It hasadapted its conveyor beltdelivery system to make diners feel safer in its restaurants in the age of coronavirus. The company is taking part in the government's 'eat out to help out' scheme, which gives people a discount of up to Â£10 per head if they dine at a restaurant between Monday and Wednesday during August. However, Mr Hodgson said: ""Like the rest of the sector, we need to take decisive action to adapt to the lasting changes that the covid pandemic has brought about."" ""While it's been a very difficult decision to make and I am very sorry that it will mean losing many of our team members, a CVA has become an essential measure to secure our business for the future, and enable us to protect as many jobs as possible."" Meanwhile, the retail sector continues to haemorrhage jobs with River Island announcing that it will cut 350 store management and senior sales roles. It adds to 250 jobs River Island said would be lost at its head office. Earlier this week,Debenhams said it would axe 2,500 roles. That is on top of 4,000 job cuts the department store announced in May.

'Widespread torture' against Belarus protesters,"Detainees freed on Friday were given medical treatment outside the Minsk detention centre Belarus's main opposition figure, Svetlana Tikhanovskaya, has called for an end to violence against protesters, while urging more rallies this weekend. Freed detainees have given details of beatings during days in custody that Amnesty International said suggested ""widespread torture"". Detained for seven hours herself after Sunday's disputed presidential vote, Ms Tikhanovskaya has fled to Lithuania. With the EU mulling new sanctions, Belarus promised to free all detainees. Some 6,700 have been detained since protests erupted on Sunday evening. At least two people have died and many more have been wounded. Belarus is seeing a sixth day of protests since the presidential vote, rejected by the EU and US as neither free nor fair. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has backed further sanctions ""against those who violated democratic values or abused human rights"". Alexander Lukashenko, in power since 1994, was declared the victor by election authorities, but Ms Tikhanovskaya's supporters insist she won. Announcing final results on Friday, the Central Election Commission said Mr Lukashenko had won 80.1% of the vote and Ms Tikhanovskaya 10.12%, state media said. In her first statement for days, the main opposition candidate said that where votes had been properly counted she had won support ranging from 60% to 70%, rather than the 10% given to her by the election committee. This video can not be played 'Human life is the most precious thing': Svetlana Tikhanovskaya speaks out from exile Calling on mayors across Belarus to organise ""peaceful mass gatherings"" on Saturday and Sunday, Ms Tikhanovskaya said: ""Belarusians will never want to live with the previous government again. The majority do not believe in his victory."" The BBC has spoken to several people, including teenagers, who have described being beaten. ""They beat people ferociously, with impunity, and they arrest anyone. We were forced to stand in the yard all night. We could hear women being beaten. I don't understand such cruelty,"" one man said as he showed the BBC his bruising. As detainees were allowed to leave the notorious Okrestina detention centre they revealed their wounds In a statement on state television, Senate speaker Natalya Kochanova said the president had ordered an investigation into the mass detention of protesters, and that more than 1,000 had been freed. All the remaining detainees were to be released on Friday morning, Deputy Interior Minister Alexander Barsukov said, while denying that prisoners had been abused. Relatives and friends of detainees wait outside Okrestina detention centre in Minsk Released prisoners shared pictures showing their bruised and swollen bodies, including injuries to backs and buttocks that they alleged were caused by police. Amnesty International said detainees described being stripped naked, beaten and threatened with rape. ""Former detainees told us that detention centres have become torture chambers, where protesters are forced to lie in the dirt while police kick and beat them with truncheons,"" said Marie Struthers, Amnesty International's director for Eastern Europe and Central Asia. Detention centres ""have become torture chambers"", said Amnesty International In audio shared by a BBC journalist, screams could be heard from inside the Okrestina detention centre in the capital Minsk. Among the testimony to emerge from freed detainees, journalist Nikita Telizhenko published a harrowing account of three days inside prison for Russian news website Znak.com. He described people lying on the floor of a detention centre, piled on top of each other, in a pool of blood and excrement. They were not allowed to use the toilet for hours on end or even change position. EU foreign ministers are meeting on Friday to consider possible sanctions on Belarus because of the crackdown. The bloc has imposed sanctions before but eased the measures several years ago when President Lukashenko released other detainees. Czech Prime Minister Andrej Babis said sanctions should be imposed ""until free and transparent elections are held in Belarus with the participation of international observers"". He said he had the support of Poland's Mateusz Morawiecki, who said he would put forward a ""solidarity with Belarus"" plan on Friday in the Polish parliament. The EU has already dismissed the presidential vote as ""neither free nor fair"", an assessment backed by US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Lithuania's president has said Mr Lukashenko is no longer Belarus's legitimate leader. Ahead of the emergency EU meeting, Belarus Interior Minister Yuri Karayev said he took responsibility for injuries suffered by bystanders, and wanted to apologise to ""people who didn't mean to be thereâ¦ bystanders, people who couldn't run away on time"". Foreign Minister Vladimir Makei said his country was ready for ""constructive and objective"" talks with other countries. Protests continued for a fifth day on Thursday Observers said that recent statements and the release of the prisoners indicated a more conciliatory approach from Belarus authorities. LETTER FROM MINSK:Shocked by violence, people lose their fear SPREADING THE NEWS:How messenger app bypassed blackout PROFILE:The stay-at-home mum challenging Belarus's longtime ruler THE CONTEXT:Five things you may not know about Belarus Belarusians returned to the streets of several cities on Friday, for a sixth day of protests since Sunday's election. Footage broadcast by messaging app Nexta on Thursday night showed demonstrators chanting ""get out"". In the western city of Grodno, workers massed outside a management office, demanding fresh elections, and car workers gathered in big numbers at the Maz plant in Minsk. These workers at the Azot company in Grodno joined a protest on Friday Several strikes have been reported at state-owned factories. Hundreds of employees were seen walking out at truck-maker Belaz in Zhodino to the north-east of the capital. Mr Lukashenko condemned ""attempts to inflame workers"", in remarks reported by Belta news agency on Friday. Meanwhile, the head of Belarus's top football club, Bate Borisov, symbolically dumped his old police uniform in the bin. In an Instagram post, Mikhail Zaleuski said he could no longer bear to see the ""impunity of people with batons and the lawlessness of power"". Protesters continued to form ""solidarity chains"" and held flowers in several cities to object to police brutality. Opposition figure Maria Kolesnikova joined thousands of female protesters in Minsk on Thursday. She was one of three women who pooled their resources to spearhead the opposition. Ms Tikhanovskaya, 37, was a stay-at-home mother until she entered the race after her husband was arrested and blocked from registering for the vote. She then led big rallies during the election campaign.

Just Eat to stop using gig economy workers,"The boss of one of the world's biggest food delivery platforms has told the BBC he intends to end gig working at his company across Europe. Jitse Groen, who runs Just Eat Takeaway, says he would rather run his company with staff who get benefits and more workplace protection. It is the model he has used at the Takeaway.com part of the business he founded 20 years ago. Gig workers have flexible hours but normally not benefits like holiday pay. In many industries, coronavirus has made incomes more unsteady for these workers, as companies look to cut back on discretionary spending. Asked if the pandemic had made him more sensitive to the difficulties gig workers face, Mr Groen said: ""It's our intent not to have those in Europe."" He said he did not like the people his company relies on to deliver food from restaurants to have to endure tougher working conditions. ""We're a large multinational company with quite a lot of money and we want to insure our people,"" he said. ""We want to be certain they do have benefits, that we do pay taxes on those workers."" Those workers have at least been busy since coronavirus lockdowns began across Europe. In the company's three biggest European markets - the UK, Germany and the Netherlands - orders rose 34% to 149 million in the first half of this year compared with the same time in 2019. Two huge mergers mean Just Eat Takeaway is set to be the world's biggest food delivery company outside China. A $7.3bn deal with US rival Grubhub was announced in June, while Takeaway, founded by Mr Groen, completed a Â£5.9bn deal for UK based Just Eat in January. Just Eat Takeaway to buy Grubhub in Â£5.75bn deal Just Eat battle ends with Takeaway.com as victor Mr Groen says demand for his companies' services have recovered from an initial fall when Europe first went into lockdown, leading to a 30% fall in revenue. ""What we've seen in March is that our revenue actually dropped, because people were hoarding food at the supermarkets and were basically surrounded by a lot of food and therefore there was no need to order online,"" he said. Just Eat Takeaway chief executive Jitse Groen wants workers to have benefits However, eating habits have since changed, with millions ordering food in because they weren't able to visit restaurants. Mr Groen said: ""If you're locked down in your house for two weeks, then you also want to eat something else, and so we saw an increase of demand from April onwards. ""And now we're actually growing much faster than we anticipated."" The Grubhub deal means that growth will accelerate even further, giving Mr Groen more to digest at a time when many companies are putting expansion plans on hold because of the pandemic. He said the merger was ""a logical thing"" and while he would have liked more time between that deal and the Just Eat one, he said: ""Let's be realistic, probably it would not have been possible in two years."" In the first six months of this year, Grubhub, which operates in 4,000 US cities, took an average of 581,700 orders a day. That could mean Mr Groen hiring a lot more staff. At the moment, freelance delivery drivers take those meals from restaurants to customers. He says: ""We're still evaluating for instance Canada and of course later on we'll have to look at the US."" But it doesn't mean riders will necessarily lose the flexibility that many enjoy and some use to top up the salaries they get from a main job. Mr Groen says there may be scope to keep the freelance model in some countries, if it is possible to pay insurance for them, but he said: ""It is our intent to make the quality of life of these people a lot better than what it might be now.""

What are my holiday refund rights?,"The newly identified Omicron variant of Covid has led to more disruption for international travellers. Quarantine is being reintroduced for people arriving from some African countries, flights have been cancelled and PCR tests will be mandatory within 48 hours of arrival to the UK from 30 November. If the government announces that travel to a particular country is not advised, then airlines and travel companies are likely to cancel any pre-booked flights or holidays there. For example, that is already the case for some flights to and from South Africa as a result of risks associated with the Omicron variant. What are the UK's new travel rules? If your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a full refund and you can choose to receive that refund in cash rather than as a voucher. An airline should refund the money within seven days, although some people have waited longer. A package holiday should be refunded, in full, within 14 days. This is far less clear-cut. If you cancel, rather than your travel provider, then you have no automatic right to a refund. In this situation, it is worth contacting the airline/holiday provider to see what options you have. EasyJet, for example, has announced that it will extend its ""freedom to change"" service - which allows passengers to change flights up to two hours before departure for free  - until 31 March, 2022. Some may charge a fee to transfer to another date or destination, but some may allow it without charging a fee. You would have to pay the difference if the alternative flight is more expensive. They may give you a voucher, or they may allow you to cancel and get a refund. That may be trickier, according to Rory Boland, travel editor at Which? who said that the property's specific policy will determine whether refunds would be given. ""If your trip is several weeks or months away, travellers should at this stage do nothing as the situation may change,"" he said. ""Those booking a trip should do so through holiday providers with good, flexible booking policies in case it cannot go ahead."" People who have booked a package holiday will be refunded in full, including accommodation, if it is cancelled by the operator. Operators do not have to refund you if you are unexpectedly forced to self-isolate. It is best to study their policies before booking, or see whether they can offer some support if you have already booked and want to cancel. Travel insurers are offering different levels of cover. In part, this depends on how much you pay for a policy. The majority, but not all, will pay out if you test positive for Covid and have to cancel before you travel. Importantly, if the Foreign Office advises against travel to a country - as it is for some in southern Africa at the moment, then all but a handful of travel insurance policies would be invalid if you still decide to go. Rules are inevitably going to be complex, given the risk of Covid varies so much between countries. The government haspublished a charter,externalthat ""clearly sets out consumer rights and responsibilities when booking travel while Covid-19 measures remain in place"". It says it expects travel operators to be ""flexible"" with customers, given the circumstances, and theCompetition and Markets Authority (CMA) has warned package holiday firmsthey must stick to refund rules. â¨ How are travel rules being relaxed?

'Frantic packing' and trips 'ruined' by quarantineHolidaymakers weigh up whether to cut their trip short or face quarantine on return to the UK.UK,"Thousands of holidaymakers have seen their plans thrown into chaos afterUK quarantine measures were alteredto include France and the Netherlands from Saturday morning. Here are some of their tales. Scott and Tracy Cuthbert have been on holiday in France with their daughter Milly ScottandTracy Cuthbert, from the village of Bloxham in Oxfordshire, say cutting their holiday in the Loire Valley short by six days was an ""easy decision to make for us because we both need to work"". Scott, a sales manager for a glazing company, was furloughed for 10 weeks but business has been going well since he returned to work - so he can't afford to miss out. And Tracy wants to make sure she's back for the start of term for the private school she works at. The couple and their daughter Milly, 16, should have been coming back next Thursday, but began ""frantically packing"" and searching for a ferry to bring them home in time after they heard news of the rule changes. They had been on holiday with three other families who are also all coming home early. ""It's ruined everyone's holiday and cut it short,"" Scott says. ""Why 14-day quarantine when parts of the UK are probably more badly affected? I am very frustrated."" The family booked themselves onto a ferry for Friday afternoon, only to realise they wouldn't make it to the port in time - so have now booked another ferry, due to leave Calais at 20:30 BST. ""We're driving up now and the sat nav says we'll have about an hour's leeway,"" Scott says from the car. Milly is already worrying about her GCSE results after the news about people being downgraded for A-levels - and is now concerned she could miss the first day back at school if the family have to self-isolate, her father adds. What are the UK travel quarantine rules? The Cuthbert family and the friends they were holidaying with all had to pack up quickly this morning Katieis a teacher in London on holiday in a remote part of France, in a private villa. She says she and her children will miss the beginning of the school term because they are a 12-hour drive to the Channel crossing ""so we can't make it back in time"". Katie says she checked the government website and signed up for any alerts to keep an eye on changes to the rules. ""We knew there may be a risk but also we couldn't get a refund on our holiday,"" she says. ""Why did they not give this call at the beginning of the week so we could have travelled back? Why were they still advising it was OK to travel to France?"" ""We have done everything the government has asked of us for months but I really think they need to treat us all with a little respect and give us time to organize ourselves."" I'm in France right now - what do I do? European countries fight coronavirus surge France to be added to UK quarantine countries Laurence Dolman with his nine-year-old son Henry, and daughters Bethan, seven, and Eliza, three Laurence Dolmanand his family, from Sheffield, have enjoyed a week of ice creams and sunshine at a Eurocamp in Wassenaar, in the Netherlands. Their ferry home will arrive in Hull at 08:30 on Saturday - four hours after the rules come into effect. Before the pandemic the family had spent about a year and a half planning a big trip around Europe for this summer, and they've lost a lot of money since it was cancelled. So they decided to treat themselves to a smaller summer holiday, and carefully picked the Netherlands as what they thought was a ""low-risk"" place to visit compared with other European countries. While Laurence, 41, and his wife Michelle, 40, have discussed ""crazy ideas"" about possibly being let off the self-isolation rules, due to ""possibly being in British naval territory"" by the cut-off time of 04:00, they have ""no regrets"" about having to quarantine. ""We deserved this holiday,"" Laurence says, citing how difficult it has been home-schooling his children during lockdown. This video can not be played British holiday maker at Calais: ""We cancelled our holiday to come home"" Asked if they considered trying to get home early, he adds: ""No, we're just going to soak up our last bit of holiday."" ""My wife and I have another week's leave before we are due to return to work. I'm fortunate that I'm able to work from home but as my wife is a social worker, it's a bit more of a problem for her"". Karl Simpson isn't rushing back from his holiday in south-east France Karl Simpsonwent to his second home in the French hamlet of Vion knowing ""full well"" he might have to quarantine on his return home to Southampton on 20 August. But now that it's been confirmed, he is worried about arranging care for his 90-year-old mother, who has dementia. ""There is no time now to rearrange care provision if I am absent,"" he says. ""Will the government help? Will I be breaking quarantine rules if I visit Mum, or do the [previous lockdown exemptions for carers] still apply? I've arranged care for the time I'm away but sustaining that care beyond the 20th will be difficult."" Karl, a 68-year-old scientist who has advised the government on vaccines and pandemic planning, is hoping the same exemptions for carers will be in place as when the UK was in full lockdown in March - but ""there's no clear guidance on that yet"". He says he agrees with the principle of quarantining after a foreign holiday, ""but it should be applied intelligently"". You finally got abroad, but was it worth it? Sun, sea and sanitiser: What your holiday will be like Tom Duffell, who runs a small business, decided to cut short his family holiday to Nice by four days and booked a last minute flight home. ""An extra two weeks off of work is just not doable,"" says Tom ""We were enjoying a nice cocktail last night and suddenly a news flash pops in and a scramble to book flights,"" he told the BBC from the airport. ""I think we've managed to get my wife and one of my sons on one flight and myself and my other son on another flight. ""We've had to spend about Â£800 because we just can't afford to take two extra weeks off of work,"" added Tom, whose wife works as an NHS nurse and volunteered in an intensive care ward. He said the government should have given tourists already in France longer to prepare. ""They could have said you know give tourists 72 hours to return to the UK, rather than just over 24 hours and there's this mad scramble,"" he said. ""Instead we're all packed into the airport. There's huge queues, social distancing's gone out of the window."" ""We're all scrambling on to the same flight, the flights are all full. Surely that's not going to help public health, that's just going to make things worse."" Will you be affected by the quarantine? Do you have a story to share? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"Labour call for urgent U-turn over 'exams fiasco'Give pupils the grades their teachers predicted, says Labour Leader Sir Keir Starmer.Family & EducationComments","There has been widespread concern about the fairness of the 'calculated' results Labour has called on ministers to act immediately to sort out an ""exams fiasco"" in England and stop thousands of A-level students being ""betrayed"". It said it was unacceptable that a ""flawed system"" had led to 280,000 pupils having their marks downgraded. Sir Keir Starmer said ministers must follow the lead of Scotland and allow teacher assessed marks to be accepted. Ministers say this risks ""grade inflation"" and disadvantaged pupils had not been disproportionately affected. But some Tory MPs have challenged the fairness of how grades have been decided. Schools North East, representing over 1,100 schools in the north east of England, also backed the use of teacher assessments. Why did the A-level algorithm say no? Anger over 'unfair' A-level results What's next in the arguments over exam results? Oxford college will uphold offers despite A-level grades But they said if that was not possible there needed to be a much more rapid and transparent way for schools to appeal, saying that using mock grades or relying on autumn exams was inadequate. In London a group of protestors gathered outside 10, Downing Street to express their anger at the results while petitions, calling for more weight to be given to teacher assessments, gained tens of thousands of signatures. Protestors angry at the exam grading system gathered outside 10, Downing Street on Friday After exams were cancelled due to the pandemic, grades were awarded using a controversial modelling system, with the key factors being the ranking order of pupils and the previous exam results of schools and colleges. This produced more top grades than have ever been seen before in A-levels, with almost 28% getting A* and As, but head teachers have been angry about ""unfathomable"" individual injustices in the downgrading of some results. This year's A-level results are higher than even before In England, 36% of entries had grades lower than their teacher assessments and 3% were down two grades. There are now calls to switch away from this system and to use teacher assessments, in the way that the government U-turned in Scotland. But England's exam watchdog Ofqual has warned that using teachers' estimates would have artificially inflated results - and would have seen about 38% of entries getting A*s and As. Labour said the lack of consistency in individual results was ""heartbreaking"" for those affected and the government was squarely to blame for sticking with a ""fatally flawed results system"". ""Across the last 24 hours the scale of the injustice has become clear,"" said Sir Keir. ""Young people and parents right across the country, in every town and city, feel let down and betrayed. ""The unprecedented and chaotic circumstances created by the UK government's mishandling of education during recent months mean that a return to teacher assessments is now the best option available,"" said the Labour leader. ""No young person should be at a detriment due to government incompetence."" Labour's education spokeswoman Kate Green also called for appeals to be able to be made by individual students, not only through schools. The Equalities and Human Rights Commission has urged the exams regulator Ofqual to consider the equality impacts of all their actions and mitigate against any potential negative affect on disadvantaged and minority groups. EHRC Chief Executive, Rebecca Hilsenrath, called on the watchdog to publish a full breakdown of the differences between teacher assessed grades and the final grade. ""Students who have been downgraded must be able to appeal directly if they believe their grades are unfair,"" she said. Figures from Ofqual showed independent schools had disproportionately benefited from the rise in top grades - up by five percentage points, compared with two percentage points for comprehensives and 0.3 percentage points for further education colleges. Northern Ireland: Minister must act 'decisively' on exam results Wales: Labour backbench revolt against A-level downgrading The chairman of the Education Select Committee, Tory MP Robert Halfon, urged Ofqual to ""explain properly how their model has worked and whether it has been fair"". Mr Halfon also said exam appeals ""should be no cost"" to students. Writing on his website, the former children's minister Tim Loughton said the results had been ""extraordinarily distressing"" for some students and urged ministers to ""look at the algorithm again for those who have missed out on their place in further education"". Another, Tory MP. Robert Syms, asked the government to ""go on teacher recommendation"" arguing that grade inflation would be less unfair than failing students who did not have the chance to take exams. And Conservative Peer, Lord Porter of Spalding, called the process for awarding grades ""shambolic"" and said it made him ashamed to be a member of the party. Lord Porter also criticised fees for appeals which can be more than Â£100 for an unsuccessful appeal. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has defended what he said were a ""robust set"" of grades and said that pupils who believed they were treated unfairly would be able to appeal or, if they wanted, sit exams in the autumn. Schools can appeal for an upgrade if their pupils' mock grades were higher than their allocated results. But the exam regulator Ofqual has still to say how a mock exam result can be validated - and head teachers have warned that mocks are not standardised or taken by all pupils, and could not be used as a fair way of deciding final exam results. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Transport Minister Grant Shapps rejected suggestions this year's exam system had been tougher on students from poorer backgrounds. ""More students from disadvantaged backgrounds are going to university and overall we've got more accepted to university than previously as well,"" said Mr Shapps. The latest figures from the Ucas admissions service do not show any significant increase in students deferring for a year. There will still be places to be decided through clearing, but so far almost 430,000 places have been accepted. What's next in the arguments over exam results?

Nine of us were put on trial - we made history," Echoes of black lives matter from 50 years ago By Ashley John-Baptiste By Ashley John-Baptiste  It was a summer Sunday afternoon and most locals were home. Curtains twitched and front doors opened. Some residents ventured bravely outside to witness the scene. Their quiet backstreet in west London had become a battleground. At a noisy but otherwise peaceful march to protest at “police harassment” of black people, fighting between protesters and police had broken out. Nine people would end up at the Old Bailey in a high-profile, but now much-forgotten, trial that secured an important spot in the timeline of black British people. This article has imagery of a pig’s head which some readers may find upsetting. In March 1968 a new all-night restaurant - the Mangrove - opened on All Saints Road in Notting Hill. Run by Trinidadian-born entrepreneur, Frank Crichlow, it was dimly lit with black leather furniture. Woman outside the Mangrove restaurant  “I remember when it started. Frank wanted it to be an upmarket restaurant. They played soul music and the waiters and waitresses dressed in white suits and straw hats,” says one of Frank’s friends, 79-year-old Clive Phillip - or “Mashup” as locals call him. Notting Hill in the late 1960s was not the sought after address it is today. There were still undeveloped bomb sites from World War Two, many of the impressive white-rendered Victorian mansions had seen better days and an elevated concrete artery - the Westway motorway - was under construction, carving the area in two. But because accommodation was cheap, many Windrush migrants - people arriving in the UK between 1948 and 1971 from Caribbean countries - called the area home.

But because accommodation was cheap, many Windrush migrants - people arriving in the UK between 1948 and 1971 from Caribbean countries - called the area home.         “The Mangrove was the ‘go to’ place for black people in the area,” says Barbara Beese, one of the Mangrove Nine. She vividly remembers the spicy aroma of West Indian food wafting through the restaurant and the mural of mangrove trees on the wall. “Frank used to make the most wicked pineapple punch. My son was weaned on that juice,” she says. Barbara Beese The Mangrove served the best Caribbean food in the area, says Clive - who loved the spring chicken with rice and peas, followed by banana fritters. Maybe that was why it attracted an impressive array of A-listers. “Bob Marley would play football around the corner, or be at the music studio, and then pop over to the Mangrove for food,” says Clive. Jimi Hendrix, Diana Ross and Marvin Gaye - plus actress Vanessa Redgrave - all sampled the cuisine. But the Mangrove was, say Clive and Barbara, more than just a restaurant. It became a home from home for the Caribbean community - and a space for political discussion. When Clive arrived in “dismal and cold” London from Trinidad, he struggled. Low on money, unable to find work at the start, and fearful of white racist “Teddy Boy” thugs - he longed for community. Then the Mangrove opened and he felt at home. Clive Phillip “It was like a sanctuary. It was family, a base of support.” Barbara agrees. “There was good food, but there was way more to it. All Saints Road and the Mangrove were popularly known as ‘the frontline’. “People associate that term with drug dealing, but what I mean is that the Mangrove was the frontline of support for the black community. “They’d get advice on things like housing. Frank’s restaurant became the crucible for all of that.” But in December 1969, two days before Christmas, the restaurant was dealt a blow. The local council - Kensington and Chelsea - suddenly withdrew Frank’s licence to operate as an all-night cafe. The Mangrove had been open from 18:00 to 06:00 - with the bulk of trade after midnight. Frank was told he could now only offer takeaway food after 23:00. He complained, claiming to be the victim of unlawful discrimination. “The Mangrove was the ‘go to’ place for black people in the area,” says Barbara Beese, one of the Mangrove Nine.

Frank was told he could now only offer takeaway food after 23:00. He complained, claiming to be the victim of unlawful discrimination. One of the reasons given to Frank for his licence removal was that “people with criminal records, prostitutes, and convicted persons” used the Mangrove. “My restaurant is patronised by respectable people,” wrote Frank on the Race Relations Board complaint form. He also said his premises had been “unlawfully raided” by police on two occasions. With his new restricted licence, Frank felt he was under close scrutiny. Frank Crichlow in 1970 “Since the decision of the council, police cars have been outside the restaurant almost every night, I assume to check I am complying with the regulations,” he wrote in another letter in early 1970. “Not once did they ever find evidence of ‘drugs, pimps and prostitutes’ as one policeman said of us who inhabited the Mangrove,” recalls Barbara. She says the police appeared to resent the restaurant’s popularity - especially with its high profile customers. “To the police, Frank was a Trinidadian businessman gaining too much influence.” Clive says the police would turn up looking for drugs. “Everyone knew Frank was anti-drugs - you most certainly couldn’t go there if you had a reputation for being dodgy or selling weed. “It was harassment. It dragged the restaurant’s reputation down. They saw us black people as a threat.” In the following months, the police raids persisted. They were “harassing the black community with impunity”, says Barbara. Frank looked for support from the local Caribbean community and the newly-formed British Black Panthers anti-racist group - which was inspired by the radical political organisation, the Black Panther Party in the US. A group called “The Action Committee for the Defence of the Mangrove” was created and preparations for a protest march began. The Mangrove restaurant “We simply wanted to make visible our opposition to what was happening at the Mangrove,” says Barbara. The building quickly became a makeshift hub for community activism. “You had the restaurant upstairs, but downstairs people were busy preparing placards for the march,” says Clive. Before the protest, the Mangrove committee wrote an open letter to Prime Minister Edward Heath and others. It said the many “deliberate raids, harassments and provocations” by the police had been reported to the Home Office on many occasions but had fallen on deaf ears. “This protest is necessary as all other methods have failed to bring about any change in the manner the police have chosen to deal with black people.” One of the reasons given to Frank for his licence removal was that “people with criminal records, prostitutes, and convicted persons” used the Mangrove. “My restaurant is patronised by respectable people,” wrote Frank on the Race Relations Board complaint form.

It was mostly made up of Caribbeans, says Clive - people from Notting Hill, Brixton, Islington and all over London. About 14:45, according to police notes, there were 100 people there. Photos show demonstrators holding banners painted with phrases like “this is the time”, “black unity now” and “hands off us pigs”. The protesters had at least one pigs head - a derogatory nod at the police - which would be held aloft once they started marching. The crowd was growing impatient and Clive remembers activist Darcus Howe stood on the roof of a car to address everybody. “We’ve complained to the police about the police and nothing’s been done,” he said. “We’ve complained to magistrates about magistrates and nothing’s been done. We’ve complained to judges about judges and nothing’s been done. Now it’s time to do something ourselves.” Remembering her late father, Darcus’s daughter Tamara describes him as being “ferociously committed to fighting injustices”. “He was always very honest with me about the realities of racism. He was uncompromising on tolerating anything that was remotely racially unjust.”  Tamara Howe As Darcus spoke, says Clive, about a dozen police officers appeared from around the corner. Darcus pointed at them, and the crowd started shouting “pigs”. “Enough was enough - we had to stick up for the Mangrove,” says Clive. The protest had started.

The marchers, numbering as many as 150 by now, intended to walk past several police stations in the area. They were vastly outnumbered by police. A police document obtained by historian Paul Field - who co-wrote a biography of Darcus Howe - revealed that 588 constables, 84 sergeants, 29 inspectors and four chief inspectors had been made available to cover the protest. There was also a handful of plain clothes and Special Branch detectives. Barbara Beese holding a pig’s head The number of police officers is something Barbara saw as “ridiculous” - given the march was intended to be “jolly and good spirited”. Police logs give a minute-by-minute account of the march’s progress. Officers appear to have been unsure of where the protestors were planning to go. At one stage, an officer spotted a two-tone Volkswagen van in a nearby street and believed it to be “loaded with eggs” which may be “used by demonstrators”.

The Mangrove march snaked its way west and then north - underneath the now newly open Westway motorway, across the Grand Union Canal and into residential streets north of the main Harrow Road. “Things turned nasty as we walked down Portnall Road,” says Clive. Police notes say the procession stopped at about 16.40 and within two minutes there was serious fighting in Portnall Road and neighbouring streets. Officers were calling for assistance and ambulances. How the fighting started is unclear. “Some placards had pig heads on them,” says Clive. “That’s how we saw the police given how they treated us black people.” “I saw a police officer pull down a placard, while a few officers pinned the guy on the ground. “I could smell trouble.” Other witnesses gave different accounts. Police notes say a number of marchers “threw bricks from a builder’s skip and disorder ensued”. One witness, an elderly woman watching from her window, said that the riot started when a bottle was thrown at a policeman: “The police did not interfere until this occurred.” A retired postman described a misunderstanding on both sides. Police stopped the procession to let a car cross its path - he said - at which point “as quick as a flash” the march leaders “seemed to lose control”.

At 16:56, police reported that about 50 protestors had started to make their way back to the Mangrove restaurant - but scuffles continued in the streets around Portnall Road for another 20 minutes or so. By the end, 24 police officers had been injured and 19 arrests had been made. Nine individuals - including Barbara Beese, Darcus Howe and Frank Crichlow - were charged with incitement to riot and affray. But these initial riot charges were ​dismissed by the presiding magistrate through lack of evidence - says Paul Field - and because “police statements were thought to be contradictory”. One senior officer stated the “melee was spontaneous” and others claimed it was incited by the defendants in order to start a riot​. In total, 23 pages of police statements were ruled to be inadmissible by the magistrate. According to a Sunday Times report from early 1971, a central point to the prosecution’s case was that protesters had allegedly shouted and had banners stating: “Kill the pigs” - a Black Power anti-police slogan imported from America. The words were evidence of violence said prosecutors, but the magistrate disagreed. Despite this, the director of public prosecutions ended up reinstating the charges. Special Branch and Home Office documents indicate, says Paul Field, the move was a “deliberate strategy to target and discredit black power leaders”. The defendants were rearrested. The Mangrove Nine, as they were becoming known, got ready to defend themselves at the Old Bailey. A new BBC drama tells the story of the Mangrove Nine - one of five original films from Bafta and Oscar-winning director Steve McQueen. Each film in McQueen’s Small Axe anthology tells a different story from London’s West Indian community, where lives have been shaped - despite racism and discrimination - by personal determination.

She was about 20 at the time and felt the room was physically very intimidating - with the judge positioned up high. “The Old Bailey was where the worst criminals went on trial, so for us to be there, it was like being told we were up there with murderers and rapists.” The strategic way the nine organised their defence is one of the reasons why the trial is considered so significant. “We took the trial issues head on,” recalls Barbara. “There was very little time to think about the emotional toll of it all. We’d spend all day in the Old Bailey and then meet for hours afterwards to debrief.” Barbara Beese, Frank Crichlow and Darcus Howe were joined in the dock by Rupert Boyce, Rhodan Gordon, Anthony Innis, Altheia Jones-LeCointe, Rothwell Kentish and Godfrey Millett. Darcus and Altheia took the bold decision to defend themselves. Darcus Howe in 2000 It meant they could speak directly to the jury, rather than going through the intermediary of a barrister. The prospect of black people defending themselves in court increased media attention. The next radical step was the demand, by Darcus, for an all-black jury - or a “jury of peers” - explains Paul Field. The judge was asked to consider an ancient precedent enshrined in the Magna Carta of 1215, which established the principle of the right to justice and a fair trial for all. “We never saw this as a fair trial and so we hoped an all-black jury would level the playing field,” says Barbara. She recalls how Altheia, Darcus and the defence barrister Ian MacDonald made legal arguments for two days. “Obviously the judge wasn’t going to have any of that,” she says. But even then, the defendants used their right to question and dismiss potential jurors. Among other things they were asked what they understood by the term “black power”. Sixty-three were rejected. The final selection included two black people. Flyer in support of the defendants In the coming weeks - the Kensington Post newspaper reported at the end of the trial - more than 50 witnesses would be called by the prosecution, and almost twice as many would be called by the defence. Barbara’s greatest concern was for her - and Darcus’s - baby son. “Part of the terror was thinking about what would’ve happened to him if we lost the case. I knew the response would have been vindictive in terms of punishment. And, as a black woman brought up in the care system, that’s the last thing I wanted to happen to my son.” A young teacher, Farrukh Dhondy - a new recruit to the Black Panther movement - was asked to take notes in court. “A lot of black people came to listen,” he says. “The word about Darcus’s oratory had spread.” “I would rush off to the Old Bailey after work. I would sit in the gallery every day for an hour or so and take notes.” Farrukh Dhondy Darcus and Farrukh were strangers at the time. In the years after, they became close friends. “Darcus was very theatrical and showed off like hell,” says Farrukh. Remembering Altheia, he says: “Whenever she spoke, you could hear a pin drop.” The trial ended on Thursday 16 December 1971. It wasn’t so much the result, as the closing remarks of the judge, that placed the Mangrove Nine in the history books. All the defendants were acquitted of the main charges of incitement to riot. Five were acquitted of all charges against them. The remaining four - Rupert Boyce, Rhodan Gordon, Anthony Innis and Altheia Jones-Lecointe - received suspended sentences for a selection of lesser offences, including affray and assaulting police officers. But it was Judge Edward Clarke’s closing comments that left a lasting mark. “What this trial has shown is that there is clearly evidence of racial hatred on both sides,” he told the courtroom. Perhaps it wasn’t so unusual, given the year, for the judge to suggest racism on the part of the defendants. The authorities and press had been accusing the Black Power movement of “anti-white racism” ever since US activist Stokely Carmichael’s visit to the UK in 1967. But more importantly, it was the first judicial acknowledgment of racism in the Metropolitan Police. “It was a big moment. Members of the jury even celebrated with us outside the Old Bailey,” says Barbara. For Farrukh, the ruling “sent a clear message to the British establishment to not go overboard with charging demonstrators.” The Met Police were not happy. “All the police officers who gave evidence were at great pains to explain they felt no personal antagonism towards black people within our community,” wrote one senior detective. “However, when directly questioned, one or two officers stated that they reserved personal views against certain individuals,” he continued. Senior officers sought, but failed, to get the judge to retract his comments. Barbara Beese still remembers the atmosphere of the courtroom. “It was male, pale and stale,” she says.

As a result of his re-arrest in October 1970 - in relation to the Portnall Road violence - he was charged with the attempted murder of a police officer. He was eventually sentenced to 36 months for assault and possession of an offensive weapon. Rothwell “Roddy” Kentish died in 2019 aged 87. Joe Kentish with his father Rothwell  “The experience made my dad bitter,” says his 44-year-old son, Joseph. “In his last years, he had dementia and on his deathbed, all he spoke about was the [second] trial. “He kept asking us to find his court papers. I still feel a massive sense of injustice for him.” At Roddy’s funeral, a letter was read from the Mangrove Nine barrister, Ian MacDonald, acknowledging that he had borne perhaps the heaviest personal cost of the trial. Joseph says there’s even a doubt over whether his father was ever at the Mangrove march - with a suggestion he was fixing a car elsewhere. Joseph Kentish  “As a community leader, police obviously assumed that Dad would’ve had a hand in the march. “One thing I know is that the period our parents went through was deeply traumatic.

They were brilliant and complex people who were deeply affected by those struggles.”  The message to take from the Mangrove trial is, according to historian Paul Field, that racial discrimination cannot only be “defeated in protests on the streets, but also by black people organising their own defence in the courtroom”. The Mangrove Nine achieved an incredible feat, he says. They convinced a white-majority jury that the police had “stains of racism” and that the officers’ “trumped up allegations were without foundation”. But the struggle for racial equality is far from over, says Barbara. “We thought we were gonna change the world back then. But still, when you look at the disproportionate number of black men in custody and the general climate we find ourselves in, we have to keep on fighting.” In a statement, a Metropolitan Police spokesperson said: “All of society - of which policing is of course a part - has a role to play in reducing disproportionate outcomes in cases where disproportionality is found to be based on ethnicity alone. We continue to work with Londoners to find a way to police London that saves lives while retaining the confidence of our communities.” Barbara says black people may be better at defending themselves and calling to account actions of error, but “there are still issues of institutional racism within the police”. That thought is echoed by Leroy Logan, a black former police superintendent - who worked in the Met for 30 years. He gave evidence to the inquiry into the 1993 murder of black teenager, Stephen Lawrence - which labelled the force as “institutionally racist”. Leroy Logan “We did see improvements for a bit [after the 1999 Lawrence Inquiry], but there are still officers in the force who, for some reason, feel emboldened to have prejudices against black people.” But for Joseph Kentish - Rothwell’s son - there has been some progress over the years. “If you’re arrested in London, I do think that as a black man you’re still in serious danger of being hurt and stereotyped - but I don’t think you need to have the same level of fear as my dad.” The Met says it has come a long way since 1999, and is more scrutinised and accountable than it has ever been, but “appreciates some concerns remain”. “We do not believe our officers are prejudiced or ignorant - or carry out racist stereotyping,” said a spokesperson. “But that is not to say there are no areas for improvement. Of course there are, as there are in all organisations and institutions today.” The message to take from the Mangrove trial is, according to historian Paul Field, that racial discrimination cannot only be “defeated in protests on the streets, but also by black people organising their own defence in the courtroom”.

Of course there are, as there are in all organisations and institutions today.”  Remembering Frank Crichlow  The Mangrove closed in 1992 and Frank Crichlow died in 2010.

'Frantic packing' and trips 'ruined' by quarantineHolidaymakers weigh up whether to cut their trip short or face quarantine on return to the UK.,"Thousands of holidaymakers have seen their plans thrown into chaos afterUK quarantine measures were alteredto include France and the Netherlands from Saturday morning. Here are some of their tales. Scott and Tracy Cuthbert have been on holiday in France with their daughter Milly ScottandTracy Cuthbert, from the village of Bloxham in Oxfordshire, say cutting their holiday in the Loire Valley short by six days was an ""easy decision to make for us because we both need to work"". Scott, a sales manager for a glazing company, was furloughed for 10 weeks but business has been going well since he returned to work - so he can't afford to miss out. And Tracy wants to make sure she's back for the start of term for the private school she works at. The couple and their daughter Milly, 16, should have been coming back next Thursday, but began ""frantically packing"" and searching for a ferry to bring them home in time after they heard news of the rule changes. They had been on holiday with three other families who are also all coming home early. ""It's ruined everyone's holiday and cut it short,"" Scott says. ""Why 14-day quarantine when parts of the UK are probably more badly affected? I am very frustrated."" The family booked themselves onto a ferry for Friday afternoon, only to realise they wouldn't make it to the port in time - so have now booked another ferry, due to leave Calais at 20:30 BST. ""We're driving up now and the sat nav says we'll have about an hour's leeway,"" Scott says from the car. Milly is already worrying about her GCSE results after the news about people being downgraded for A-levels - and is now concerned she could miss the first day back at school if the family have to self-isolate, her father adds. What are the UK travel quarantine rules? The Cuthbert family and the friends they were holidaying with all had to pack up quickly this morning Katieis a teacher in London on holiday in a remote part of France, in a private villa. She says she and her children will miss the beginning of the school term because they are a 12-hour drive to the Channel crossing ""so we can't make it back in time"". Katie says she checked the government website and signed up for any alerts to keep an eye on changes to the rules. ""We knew there may be a risk but also we couldn't get a refund on our holiday,"" she says. ""Why did they not give this call at the beginning of the week so we could have travelled back? Why were they still advising it was OK to travel to France?"" ""We have done everything the government has asked of us for months but I really think they need to treat us all with a little respect and give us time to organize ourselves."" I'm in France right now - what do I do? European countries fight coronavirus surge France to be added to UK quarantine countries Laurence Dolman with his nine-year-old son Henry, and daughters Bethan, seven, and Eliza, three Laurence Dolmanand his family, from Sheffield, have enjoyed a week of ice creams and sunshine at a Eurocamp in Wassenaar, in the Netherlands. Their ferry home will arrive in Hull at 08:30 on Saturday - four hours after the rules come into effect. Before the pandemic the family had spent about a year and a half planning a big trip around Europe for this summer, and they've lost a lot of money since it was cancelled. So they decided to treat themselves to a smaller summer holiday, and carefully picked the Netherlands as what they thought was a ""low-risk"" place to visit compared with other European countries. While Laurence, 41, and his wife Michelle, 40, have discussed ""crazy ideas"" about possibly being let off the self-isolation rules, due to ""possibly being in British naval territory"" by the cut-off time of 04:00, they have ""no regrets"" about having to quarantine. ""We deserved this holiday,"" Laurence says, citing how difficult it has been home-schooling his children during lockdown. This video can not be played British holiday maker at Calais: ""We cancelled our holiday to come home"" Asked if they considered trying to get home early, he adds: ""No, we're just going to soak up our last bit of holiday."" ""My wife and I have another week's leave before we are due to return to work. I'm fortunate that I'm able to work from home but as my wife is a social worker, it's a bit more of a problem for her"". Karl Simpson isn't rushing back from his holiday in south-east France Karl Simpsonwent to his second home in the French hamlet of Vion knowing ""full well"" he might have to quarantine on his return home to Southampton on 20 August. But now that it's been confirmed, he is worried about arranging care for his 90-year-old mother, who has dementia. ""There is no time now to rearrange care provision if I am absent,"" he says. ""Will the government help? Will I be breaking quarantine rules if I visit Mum, or do the [previous lockdown exemptions for carers] still apply? I've arranged care for the time I'm away but sustaining that care beyond the 20th will be difficult."" Karl, a 68-year-old scientist who has advised the government on vaccines and pandemic planning, is hoping the same exemptions for carers will be in place as when the UK was in full lockdown in March - but ""there's no clear guidance on that yet"". He says he agrees with the principle of quarantining after a foreign holiday, ""but it should be applied intelligently"". You finally got abroad, but was it worth it? Sun, sea and sanitiser: What your holiday will be like Tom Duffell, who runs a small business, decided to cut short his family holiday to Nice by four days and booked a last minute flight home. ""An extra two weeks off of work is just not doable,"" says Tom ""We were enjoying a nice cocktail last night and suddenly a news flash pops in and a scramble to book flights,"" he told the BBC from the airport. ""I think we've managed to get my wife and one of my sons on one flight and myself and my other son on another flight. ""We've had to spend about Â£800 because we just can't afford to take two extra weeks off of work,"" added Tom, whose wife works as an NHS nurse and volunteered in an intensive care ward. He said the government should have given tourists already in France longer to prepare. ""They could have said you know give tourists 72 hours to return to the UK, rather than just over 24 hours and there's this mad scramble,"" he said. ""Instead we're all packed into the airport. There's huge queues, social distancing's gone out of the window."" ""We're all scrambling on to the same flight, the flights are all full. Surely that's not going to help public health, that's just going to make things worse."" Will you be affected by the quarantine? Do you have a story to share? Emailhaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external.

"Lockdown to ease further in England from SaturdayMore beauty treatments, small wedding receptions and live indoor shows can resume this weekend.UK","Newlyweds will be able to celebrate their nuptials with a wedding reception in the form of a sit down meal for up to 30 guests More beauty treatments, small wedding receptions and live indoor performances will be able to resume in England from Saturday, as lockdown rules are eased. Bowling alleys, casinos and soft play centres will also be able to reopen, PM Boris Johnson has announced. It comes as the government introduces bigger fines for failing to wear a mask in places where it is compulsory. Meanwhile, quarantine measures have been imposed on more countries,including France and the Netherlands. The easing of lockdown rules is now due to come into force on Saturday, after being postponed from 1 August due to concerns about a slight increase in the number of people testing positive for coronavirus in England. Last week, figures from the Office for National Statistics showed thismay be levelling off. However,the latest government figures released on Friday,externalshowed the number of daily positive tests in the UK was the highest it has been since 14 June. In the 24-hour period up to 09:00 BST, there were a further 1,441 confirmed cases, taking the total number to 316,367. Under the latest changes: Indoor theatre, music and performance venues will be able to reopen with socially distanced audiences Wedding receptions in the form of a sit-down meal for up to 30 guests will be permitted The piloting of a small number of sporting events to test the safe return of spectators will resume, commencing with the final of the World Snooker Championship at Sheffield's Crucible Theatre over the weekend Casinos, bowling alleys, skating rinks and soft play centres will be allowed to reopen ""Close contact"" beauty services such as facials, eyebrow threading, eyelash treatments, make up application and microblading will resume Pilots will take place at conference venues ahead of the expected resumption of business events from 1 October at the earliest The new guidance will not apply in areas where local lockdown measures are in place, the government said. Local lockdown rules vary from place to place, but since July measures have been introduced in Leicester, Preston, East Lancashire, parts of West Yorkshire. Greater Manchester, and Aberdeen. What are the rules for face masks or face coverings? How to stay cool in a face mask What can't I do in the local lockdowns?,external The Department of Health said restrictions on household gatherings in parts of the North West, West Yorkshire, East Lancashire and Leicester will continue. The latest data does not show a decrease in the number of cases per 100,000 people in the area and shows a continued rise in cases in Oldham and Pendle, while numbers remain high in Blackburn with Darwen, the department said. The measures will be reviewed again next week. Soft play centres are among the venues able to reopen from 15 August Devolved administrations in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland have the power to set their own timings for the easing of restrictions. The prime minister said that plans to open up more of the economy this weekend ""will allow more people to return to work and the public to get back to more of the things they have missed"". But Mr Johnson reiterated a warning that the government ""will not hesitate to put on the brakes if required, or to continue to implement local measures to help to control the spread of the virus"". Salon's phone 'ringing off hook' as lockdown eases 'Mixed emotions' as soft play gets green light New guidance will also mean that staff offering ""close contact"" services, including hairdressers, will now have to wear a face mask as well as a clear visor. The government said the move, which follows new evidence from the scientific advisory group for emergencies (Sage) is aimed at protecting customers and staff from respiratory droplets caused by sneezing, coughing, or speaking. It also applies to businesses that operate remotely, such as massage therapists working in people's homes, and those learning in vocational training environments. Nightclubs and discos are among the venues that remain closed in law. SOCIAL DISTANCING:What are the rules now? JOBS:Can my boss force me to go to work? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? TESTING:Who can get a test and how? GLOBAL SPREAD:Tracking the pandemic On Thursday, France reported 2,524 new coronavirus cases in 24 hours, the highest daily increase since its lockdown was lifted in May. Under current guidance, people who refuse to wear a face covering where it is required face a Â£100 fine, which can be reduced to Â£50 if paid within 14 days. The new enforcement measures will see that penalty repeatedly doubled for subsequent offences, up to a maximum of Â£3,200. ""Most people in this country are following the rules and doing their bit to control the virus, but we must remain focused and we cannot be complacent,"" Mr Johnson said. ""That is why we are strengthening the enforcement powers available to use against those who repeatedly flout the rules."" By Tom Symonds, home affairs correspondent Just as cases of Covid-19 rose in the spring, peaked and fell, so has the use by police of fines to enforce social distancing restrictions. This means that instead, officers have increasingly preferred to ""engage, explain and encourage"" in the police jargon. It is difficult and sometimes risky work. ""Encouraging"" large groups of young people to leave illegal parties has led to violence. Senior officers say they are prepared to prosecute the organisers. However, in general, police believe they have got people to follow the rules hundreds of thousands of times without handing out fines. The question is whether local breakouts of the virus, and the risk of a ""second wave"" will increase the pressure for a tougher approach. As countries are added to the list of those from which returning travellers have to quarantine, there could also be questions about whether there is a realistic risk of catching people who refuse to do so. In England, face coverings are mandatory in many indoor settings, including public transport, shops and museums, with some exemptions for children or on medical grounds. Transport for London and British Transport Police have already made 91,501 interventions based on present face coverings guidance, the government said - preventing 4,397 from boarding, asking 3,030 to leave the network and issuing 341 penalty notices. There will also be a clampdown on illegal gatherings of more than 30 people, which could see those responsible hit with spot fines of up to Â£10,000. This video can not be played Face coverings are mandatory in England in all shops According to the government, forces across England and Wales have already stepped up patrols to prevent illegal gatherings in areas of concern, such as Leicester and Greater Manchester, where it said deployments have sometimes been larger than on New Year's Eve. Last weekend, West Midlands Police shut down 125 parties and raves - and closed a pub - taking action to stop illegal gatherings and anti-social behaviour across the region. Further detail on the new enforcement measures is to be set out in the coming week. Home Secretary Priti Patel said she would not allow progress against the virus to be undermined by ""a small minority of senseless individuals"". ""These measures send a clear message - if you don't cooperate with the police and if you put our health at risk, action will follow.""

Greg Rutherford found testicle lump during lockdown,"Greg Rutherford is encouraging men to check their testicles for lumps, after revealing he ignored his. The 33-year-old Olympic athlete's mental health ""took a bit of a beating"" when he found a lump during lockdown, he wrote on Instagram. After getting checked Greg was told he has cysts - a fluid build up - and now wants other men to ""take it seriously"". The ""invincibility"" he felt in sport ""took a massive knock"" and he didn't discuss it with his wife. The dad-of-two, who won an Olympic gold medal for long jump at London 2012, now wants everyone to check themselves, and also suggests partners could offer to do it. ""Even now, during a pandemic, when I think it's safe to say we're fearful of wasting doctors' and nurses' time. If you're a bloke, grab them and make sure nothing's wrong,"" he wrote.

'One cubicle toilet for about 26 of us' - sportswomen speak out,"Almost two-thirds of elite British female athletes have experienced sexism in sport but the vast majority did not feel able to report it. In theBBC Elite British Sportswomen's survey, 65% of respondents had suffered sexism, but only 10% reported it. The figures have worsened over the past five years since the last survey was carried out. In 2015, 41% had suffered sexism, with 7% reporting it. Athletes said they did not know who to report it to, and that their mostly male coaches would not understand or take them seriously. They did not think it would make a difference anyway and would involve significant sacrifice. Women feel their chances of selection for teams or events would be harmed if they stood up and spoke out against sexism. So here are the stories of four women and the sexism they have faced, all anonymised so that speaking up does not mean losing out. A golfer shares her experiences of sexism while playing in pro-ams, where a professional plays with male amateurs who are sometimes affiliated with sponsors of a tournament. ""It's the perpetual comments on your physique. I've had guys jokingly propose to me on the second hole and then do it again five holes later, then again on the next hole, to the point that it gets awkward, uncomfortable and too persistent. ""It's not appropriate for the context and environment that we're in. It's disrespectful - it should be about my golf, not those sorts of things. ""There are always questions like: 'Do you have a boyfriend? How's your dating life?' Things that they probably wouldn't ask guys. ""I've had a few experiences like that in pro-ams. It's frustrating. There's not really anything you can do or say about it because they're sponsors. ""A lot of the time they're people who are literally allowing you to play in this event and make a living. They kind of take advantage of that a bit. We're so reliant on these people. ""There's nothing we can do without fear of losing sponsorship or losing future opportunities. If you stand up for yourself, they're just going to be like: 'Oh, she's no fun.' You have to tread very carefully. ""For the most part, in terms of sexism in women's golf, the people we come into contact with are super supportive of women's golf. ""It's more the outside people looking in who don't understand it. That's where the issues lie. ""It isn't every time. I have had some incredible pro-am experiences that I wouldn't change. It's just a couple of times a year. You know as soon as you get on the first tee if it's going to be a rough one. ""I know the other girls in the field are experiencing the same thing so I'm sure there are a couple of us every week that experience some form of inappropriateness and disrespect that is frustrating."" An Olympic gold medallist explains how she felt when she discovered a less high-profile male athlete was getting paid more than her by the same sponsor. ""There was a male player who was with the same sponsor and got paid a lot more money than me. ""He was famous in his own right but in my opinion, and I said this to them, on a digital platform in terms of promoting the brand he doesn't have social media, he doesn't do many talks. ""If you look at value as a person - he's an amazing person. But value as a business: it wasn't the same, especially after I won an Olympic gold medal. ""So I made the decision to move sponsors for less money out of principle. I quickly found out that one of the male athletes was on double the amount I was on. ""When I found out a person who at that point hadn't achieved anything was on double what I was, I very quickly left. ""I went back to the original sponsor who upped my contract and apologised, which they admitted they should have done in the first place. ""It was very frustrating. In our sport, men are still getting more money, bigger sponsorships and I don't understand why. There isn't any reason for it - it's literally because they are men."" An athlete speaks about a time when she represented her country at a stadium usually used by men, meaning the toilet facilities were not functional for women. ""As nice as the changing room is - it's spacious, there's a hot tub, ice bath, everything going - there's one cubicle toilet. We're talking 26-28 people with one cubicle. I love playing there and you feel so welcome as a team, but there's one cubicle. ""You literally have to change the schedule to allow time for people to go to the toilet. Everyone needs to go before we warm up and when you come in from the warm-up. ""But what do you do? You don't want to call off the whole match because there's only one cubicle. I don't really want portaloos either because you're playing international sport. ""It's things like that - it's become normal to accept it."" An elite sportswoman who represents England describes how coaches favour male players and why she feels powerless to stop it. ""The ideas of the past - that the men's game is more physical and more interesting, that they are pushing the boundaries - are still in place because coaches have been in place for years and years. ""The men get put on the main training areas and the coaches will mill around those areas and the women will be put on the side to carry on the routines but not really get the feedback and the coaching input. ""We've had some women's squad sessions which have highlighted how much previously it was tailored to the men's side of the game. We realised how different things can be and how much value we can get. ""It's brilliant that they are trying to change but the system is so ingrained with this male dominance. I'm not even sure they are aware that they do it, it's just an everyday occurrence but as a woman playing in that sport it's disheartening to see. ""I have at times said that things weren't acceptable and that men are saying derogatory things to women but it has not been taken seriously. ""It was the whole: 'Oh, you're a feminist, you're undermining us, you just have women's rights ahead and you don't take a balanced approach on it.' ""I'm quite happy to keep saying these things aren't fair but with the coaches it's different - because they are your selectors. ""And unfortunately, as much as you don't like the system you have to roll with the system because they are the people who are going to be selecting you for your country. ""When I'm out of the system and I'm finished I would like to think I'd be able to say more things about how I didn't like the way we were treated and how I couldn't say so at the time because of fear of the end of progression of my career. ""You have to be in favour because as soon you're out - regardless of your results - there is always a reason not to select you. You have to be at the top of your game to have any power."" Here is a selection of other anonymous responses given in the sexism section of the survey: I had a previous national coach who was completely sexist and I was bullied I believe for being female, which was reported and brushed under the carpet by another male. I have personally been jeered and laughed at for being a female rugby player at different clubs from the crowd. Clubs I have played at have declined to let my team use the main field despite being one of the top competing teams in the league, and not washed kit or refused to let us use changing rooms or provide female hygiene facilities or food after games. Men are paid more than women at the club even though the women outperform the men at the same level in the sport. Men are also given priority on facility use, finance, travel, spectator slots, promotion etc. The owner of the club labelled himself as ""a sexist pig"" so I don't see much point in  reporting it and don't want to reduce funding to the women further. We are not allowed in the gym when the men are in there or not allowed in the same room as the men even though we play for the same team and represent the same country . Referees making women play to junior rules, coaches not treating us with the same respect as men, spectators saying rugby would get more crowds if we played in sport bras and hot pants, people asking about showers after games. I don't report it because it never gets heard or nothing is done about it. Sometimes challenging it just fuels the fire. On occasions male coaches that thought I was pretty would inappropriately express that to me when in a position of power. I didn't want to annoy or get my manager in trouble in case I wouldn't be selected. I have been in the situation in the past where a male coach showed a lot of interest in my sport and gave me a lot of advice so I felt really supported, motivated and I improved a lot. Then after a year of this, there was an occasion where I did not reciprocate his advances and then after that the advice and help stopped and I did feel very demotivated by that.

Train crash survivor walked mile to raise alarm,"A derailment which left three people dead happened after the train struck a landslip covering the track,the Rail Accident Investigation Branch has said,external. The driver, conductor and a passenger died when the 06:38 Aberdeen to Glasgow service crashed near Stonehaven. The RAIB said the train had turned back towards Aberdeen after reports of a landslip further down the track. The six-vehicle train had travelled more than a mile when it was derailed after hitting a separate landslip. The track curved to the right, but investigators said the train continued in a straight line for about 100 yards before hitting the parapet of a bridge. Are we doing enough to modernise infrastructure? Tributes paid to three killed in train derailment What we know about the Stonehaven derailment The locomotive at the front of the train continued over the bridge and fell down an embankment, as did the third passenger carriage. The first passenger carriage came to rest on its roof, at right angles to the track, with the second passenger carriage on top of it. The fourth passenger carriage remained upright and also came to rest on top of the first carriage. It was still attached to the rear locomotive. The RAIB said the train had left Stonehaven station and passed Carmont on Wednesday morning when it was stopped by a signaller who had received a report of a landslip further along the track. The decision was taken to return to Aberdeen, and the train was routed back over a crossover at Carmont. The RAIB said it was collecting evidence on the cause and consequences of the accident. It will examine the sequence of events and the actions of those involved, as well as the management of earthworks and drainage in the area, including recent inspections and risk assessments. Tributes have been paid to Brett McCullough, Donald Dinnie and Chris Stuchbury Simon French, chief inspector of the RAIB, said: ""Thankfully, fatal derailments are a rare occurrence on the UK's national network. ""However, landslips and other earthworks failures remain a risk to trains that needs to be constantly managed - and this is becoming even more challenging for the rail industry due to the increasing incidence of extreme weather events."" Driver Brett McCullough, conductor Donald Dinnie and passenger Christopher Stuchbury died in the crash. On Thursday, their families told of their devastation at their deaths. In a fresh tribute on Friday, the Roxburghe House hospice in Aberdeen where Mr Stuchbury volunteered in his spare time said he was ""incredibly caring"". And two police officers from British Transport Police laid flowers in tribute to the men who died. The officers, who knew Mr McCullough and Mr Dinnie for many years, had gone to the scene from their homes as soon as they heard the news. Prince Charles thanked emergency responders for their bravery when he visited the crash site on Friday. He met some of those among the first on the scene, including Pc Liam Mercer and Pc Eilidh McCabe. Police Scotland Chief Inspector Kevin Walker said the visit by was ""very much appreciated by everyone"" and those on scene were ""grateful for the genuine interest he showed in hearing about their experiences"". It earlier emerged that an off-duty rail worker walked a mile to raise the alarm after surviving the accident. Prince Charles visited the scene of the crash on Friday The prince met emergency responders who were among the first on the scene Transport Secretary Michael Mathesontold BBC Scotland's The Ninethat a ""number of actions"" were taken after the derailment to raise the alarm. He said: ""There was a call made by someone who believed that an incident had taken place locally and they contacted Police Scotland. ""There was also an off-duty railway person on the train who, after it derailed, walked around a mile to the next signal box and advised them that an incident had occurred, which allowed Network Rail at its national control centre to close the line. ""During the course of that, Police Scotland obviously dispatched their staff and Network Rail dispatched some of the staff that they had working nearby to respond to the incident."" UK Transport Minister Grant Shapps has asked Network Rail to produce an interim report by 1 September. Network Rail said it would carry out detailed inspections of high-risk trackside slopes with similar characteristics to the site of the Aberdeenshire crash. Dozens of sites across Britain will be assessed using in-house engineers, specialist contractors and helicopter surveys. Scotland's Lord Advocate has asked Police Scotland, British Transport Police and the Office of Rail and Road, the independent regulator, to conduct a joint investigation into the accident. This will run in parallel with the independent safety investigation being carried out by the RAIB. Are we doing enough to modernise infrastructure?

"'We were all packed, then they cancelled'","James and his wife, Georgina, both key workers worked long days through lockdown. By the end of July they were more than ready for their holiday. ""We were literally all packed, kids had their rucksacks,"" says James. ""Half the stuff was in the car."" They were just about to set out on the four hour drive to Alder Country Park in Norfolk, when the phone rang. The holiday that they booked before Christmas was no longer available. ""I was shell-shocked,"" says James. ""We said, how can it not be available? We booked it last year."" Their eldest daughter is in a wheelchair so they plan well ahead to ensure they find somewhere that can accommodate her needs. But they were told that a maintenance problem at the lodge they'd booked meant it was cancelled. In a normal year Hoseasons, the firm through which it had been booked, says it would have tried to find them an alternative, but with demand for UK holidays sky high this year, everywhere was fully booked. ""I came off the phone and said 'sorry kids, no holiday', says James. The younger ones burst into tears. They aren't alone. Dozens of holiday-makers have contacted BBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme to say their holiday has been cancelled at short notice. A Facebook page set up by disgruntled Hoseasons customers has more than 500 members. Rod Leaman booked a four night stay at the Welcome Family Holiday Park in Devon through Hoseasons in February. Less than a fortnight before he was due to go he received an e-mail saying that his booking had been cancelled as the dates he'd chosen were no longer available. Where can I now go on holiday in the UK? When Mr Leaman phoned the holiday park itself, he was told that when it reopened in July the owners had decided not to take bookings for less than a week. ""I would happily have paid for the extra three nights, but that option wasn't given to me,"" he says. The booking was for his daughter Claire so she could get away for a holiday with her partner and her fifteen-year-old daughter Rayah. Some disappointed holidaymakers were given no explanation at all. Jill Turner, a teacher from Poole in Dorset, received a text message from Hoseasons, apologising for cancelling the caravan she'd booked for four nights in mid-August. It took Jill an hour to get through to the company on the phone, she says. Even then, she says they didn't offer any reason why they couldn't honour her reservation. After the BBC looked into Jill's case, Hoseasons admitted the caravan had been double-booked. 'It was for Claire and Rayah', says Rod Leaman of the holiday he booked. ""I'm really disappointed about the whole situation, that a company who we thought we could trust... that they could send an 'oh we are sorry', when they weren't"", says Jill. ""What was really annoying was that no-one actually seemed to care."" Hoseasons told the BBC that double-bookings had occurred in a small number of cases because of the large volume of bookings and rebookings taking place as lockdown was eased. Hoseasons is part of the holiday rental company, the Awaze group. The group also owns Cottages.com, many of whose customers have reported similar last-minute cancellations. Children's author Michael Rosen was one of them.  He spent 47 days on a ventilator after being admitted to hospital with coronavirus in March. As he finally began to recover, his wife Emma-Louise Williams booked and paid in full for a week's holiday at a cottage in Somerset. But four days before they were due to leave, Cottages.com contacted them to cancel their booking, saying the property was no longer available for the dates she had booked. Author Michael Rosen and producer Emma-Louise Williams were looking forward to a holiday after his long battle with coronavirus Emma-Louise was later told by the key-holder of the property that it had been double-booked. The holiday firm promised a full refund within 3 to 5 days, as well as Â£250 in compensation. On 31st July, the day James and his family were told their holiday was cancelled, Henrik Kjellberg chief executive of Awaze UK published a letter of apology to customers. ""Though we expected demand to resurface as UK travel restrictions were lifted, we didn't plan for a tenfold increase, which is what we've experienced on some of our platforms in recent weeks,"" he wrote. ""To put it simply - our systems didn't scale to the level we needed them to and this regrettably caused some duplicate bookings to occur."" The firm says as well as the technical glitch there have been a handful of other reasons for cancellations. Hoseasons doesn't own the properties it takes bookings for and says some became unavailable after owners decided to withdraw them, either to use them themselves, or as a result of concerns around Covid-19. Bookings for UK holidays have surged due to the coronavirus pandemic The firm says late cancellations have affected less than 1% of bookings in July and August and those affected will be promptly refunded. But customers who contacted the BBC and joined the Facebook site said it has been hard to get hold of Hoseasons to arrange a refund. The firm says it will be adding further capacity by hiring more staff for its contact centre. James and Georgina, who paid the full Â£1,500 bill for their holiday back in January, have been told they will get some compensation, but they haven't yet received it or their money back. They are still angry and feel they are owed an explanation. Countrywide, which owns Alder Country Park, says the maintenance issue at the lodge, caused by a hot tub, was only identified on the day James and Georgina were due to arrive. Countrywide apologised for the late cancellation. James says he still feels like he's in limbo, but in hindsight it is less about the money than the disappointment. ""It's been tough for everyone - during what's happened in lockdown. It's been tough for Hoseasons, I get that. What I don't get is just dropping it on us with five hours' notice. How can they not have known?""

Labour backbench revolt against A-level downgradingA review is called for so politicians can be confident no student in Wales has been unfairly treated.Wales politics,"Education Minister Kirsty Williams met students at Merthyr College on results day The Welsh Government's handling of exam results is to be ""urgently"" examined by a Senedd committee amid criticism over the grading of A-levels. Students have accused the Welsh Government of ""abandoning them"" after 42% of grades were lowered by the exams watchdog. As head teachers described the results as ""unjust"", the Senedd's education committee has been recalled. But First Minister Mark Drakeford has said it was ""a record year"" for pupils. ""The big picture is we have more students achieving, more students achieving at the very top end of the scale, and a record number of people from Wales accepted into university,"" he told BBC Wales. The handling of the results system has seen the Labour government come under fire from head teachers and some of its own backbenchers, who said some pupils had got results two grades lower than predicted. This video can not be played Bradley Desmier was predicted a B, C and a merit but got a D, E and a pass The Welsh Parliament is on its summer break, but the Children, Young People and Education Committee will now meet on Tuesday. Chair Lynne Neagle said decision-makers must explain what happened to provide ""clarity"", ahead of the publication of GCSE results next week. ""Young people's well-being, and their ability to plan for their future learning and careers, will be at the centre of our work looking at these issues,"" she said. ""We recognise that these matters are complex and will need detailed, longer term consideration. However, we believe that there is an important role for us to play now, to ask questions which will ensure that a fair and clear approach is adopted and communicated to the Welsh people as quickly as possible."" Exams were cancelled after schools were closed in March Mike Hedges, Labour member of the Senedd for Swansea East, had said he knew of pupils receiving a lower than predicted grade ""without any samples of their work being checked"". But Mr Drakeford told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast: ""I read what people said, and I don't agree that it was strong criticism."" Labour MS for Aberavon David Rees has backed calls for a ""full review"" to examine whether poorer areas have been more affected by the grading system than more affluent areas. ""The robust and fair quotes that the government is talking about is of course consistency across Wales, but I do not believe that that has actually been fair to individuals,"" he told BBC Radio Wales. ""These are young people whose futures are on the line."" Unfair results claim after grades lowered Minister makes pledge on this year's grades Exams were cancelled this summer due to the coronavirus pandemic, with results based on teacher estimates. But 42% were downgraded by exams watchdog,Qualifications Wales, after it judged the grades were ""too generous"". On Wednesday, Education Minister Kirsty Williams promised that students would be guaranteed a grade no lower than they achieved at AS-level. But with the last-minute intervention coming after results had already been sent to schools and colleges, there are concerns that universities may judge applications on the grades already issued, before that revision takes effect. In an open letter to Ms Williams, 16 members of the Welsh Youth Parliament also called for action. Welsh Youth Parliament member Jonathan Powell says students feel ""abandoned"" A-level student and Wrexham youth parliament member Jonathan Powell said: ""Not only have you abandoned thousands of students who did not have a chance to sit their exams, but you have demonstrated a lack of respect and trust in teachers across the nation."" He said he had been predicted to achieve A* and A grades, but was awarded a single A grade and Bs. ""How is it justifiable that A*s are brought down to Bs?"" he asked. Abbie Cooper, 17, from Cwmbran is another member of the youth parliament who signed the letter. She said her predicted AS-level grades were downgraded from three Bs to an unclassified and two D grades. ""It kind of feels like they just got a number generator or a letter generator and given you a grade based on that,"" she said. ""It sucks because I need these to apply for university next year because these are my predicted for university. How can I go anywhere with these?"" She said it had left her felling ""distraught"" and she would now be appealing the results. Natalie Johns said her future was decided by people who did not know her work or what she could and had achieved When Natalie Johns opened her A-level results on Thursday, the results were not what she was predicted. The 18-year-old's teachers had calculated she would get all A*s, meaning she would meet the requirements of her conditional offer to study psychology at Cambridge University. But when she opened her results at Y Pant School, in Rhondda Cynon Taff, her results had been lowered to one A* in biology, with As in maths and psychology. The teenager had a desperate 24 hours after her chosen college said they could not accept her, and she was put in a ""summer pool"" waiting to see if another college would let her in. But she has since had the good news she has been accepted after her school and MP got involved, but said she would still be fighting to get the grade changed. ""It is not important right now, but these A-level results are going to stick with me for life - if I am going for a job, it's not going to have a sticker next to it saying the grade is because of Covid-19,"" she said. ""It was such a let down, that this is how we were treated and how our [school] education came to an end."" Natalie said she was angry with the Welsh Government for their response to students' concerns. ""They are almost bragging about how you can't go lower than your AS grade, but you can't get an A* at AS-level,"" said Natalie. ""For high achievers wanting to go on to study medicine and other subjects, it really matters. It's the injustice of it."" Some pupils were pleased with their results Head teachers in north Wales said the way results were allocated was ""unfair"" and ""impossible to fathom"", saying their own teachers' estimates had been done with ""professionalism and fairness"". The Federation of North Wales Secondary School Head Teachers said many universities had lowered their offers due to a shortage of international students during the pandemic. But while that meant many students would be able to attend their university of choice, the A-level grades would be ""with them for the rest of their lives"". Claire Armitstead, head teacher of Rhyl High School, said the system had generated ""numerous inconsistencies"". ""It can never be forgotten that every inconsistency is a child whose life has been turned upside by an algorithm and this cannot be allowed to happen,"" she said. ""It is unjust and immoral and our children deserve better."" Geraint Parry, head teacher at Ysgol Brynhyfryd, in Ruthin, Denbighshire, said: ""Students have been disregarded, downgraded and simply told 'computer says no'."" Ellen Williams, head of Llanrug's Ysgol Brynrefail, Gwynedd, said the grading system had ""resulted in many of our young people's lives being devastated"". Plaid Cymru's leader also urged Mr Drakeford to ensure pupils in Wales awarded lower grades received their predicted results instead. In a letter to the first minister, Adam Price said this should also apply to next week's GCSE results ""and this should be communicated to learners today, for peace of mind"". Mr Price pointed to comments from the UK Labour leader Keir Starmer, who has said ministers in Englandmust follow the lead of Scotland and allow teacher assessed marks to be accepted. But Wales' first minister said Mr Starmer was referring to the position in: ""England, where they don't have AS-levels; England where you have to pay for an appeal; England where people will be kept waiting for longer for results than they have here in Wales. ""Our position is very different."" A pupil from Swansea checking her results on Thursday A Welsh Government spokesman said about 94% of the grades were the same or within one grade of those students were predicted to achieve. ""This is before any adjustments are made as a result of the AS [level] floor announced yesterday by the minister for education,"" he added. ""We have also asked Qualifications Wales to consider whether the grounds for appeal can be broadened for all A-level, AS-level and GCSE qualifications and we expect to provide more information on this next week. ""No student from Wales should be disadvantaged against other UK students. ""We are pleased that, following the publication of the results today, UCAS have reported the highest number of Welsh learners being offered a place at university since 2011.""

Fewer hospital patients in Covid-19 hotspots,"The number of people in hospital with Covid-19 fell in coronavirus hotspots in June and July, according to data released by NHS England. Cases of coronavirus have been rising nationally since the middle of July, and even earlier in Leicester. More of these cases are among young people, who are less likely to become seriously sick. A University of Oxford expert said there were ""not yet any signs of a second wave in the hospital data"". The number of people dying or going into hospital with Covid-19 has been falling across the UK for months, but since the middle of July, the number of confirmed cases has started to rise. Prof Chris Whitty, the UK's chief medical adviser, has warned that we have ""reached the limit of what we can do to open up society"" without allowing room for the virus to return. But some scientistsargue that the rise in confirmed cases could reflect more testingrather than more infections. It may still be too soon for any increase in infections to translate into more people in hospital or dying with Covid-19 nationally. But hotspots can test the theory since their numbers of cases started to increase earlier. Leicester saw worsening infection figures throughout the early summer before Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced a local lockdown at the end of the June. And Blackburn overtook Leicester as the part of the country with the highest rate of infection in July. Data released on Thursday by NHS England showed that rising cases were not matched by an increase in the number of people in hospital in the NHS trusts that serve either of these councils. The number of people admitted to hospital for the first time with Covid-19 did increase in Leicester in June, but the rise was much smaller than the rise in confirmed cases. In July, Leicester saw 1,336 cases but only seven people were admitted to hospital with Covid-19. In Blackburn, the number of infections more than doubled in July, but the number of people admitted to hospital fell from 54 in June to 13 in July. More of the cases now being detected nationally are in people aged 15-44. They are much less likely to become seriously ill or die with coronavirus. That could explain some of the UK's fall in Covid-19 hospitalisations, according to Jason Oke, a researcher at the Centre for Evidence Based Medicine at Oxford University. But ""there are not yet any signs of a second wave in the hospital data"", he says.

Trump stokes discredited Harris 'birther' theory,"President Donald Trump says he has ""heard"" Democratic candidate Kamala Harris ""doesn't qualify"" to serve as US vice-president, amplifying a fringe legal theory critics decry as racist. She was born in the US to a Jamaican father and Indian mother in Oakland, California, on 20 October 1964. As such, she is eligible to serve as president or vice-president. For years, Mr Trump promoted a false ""birther"" theory that ex-President Barack Obama was not born in the US. Ms Harris, a California senator, was named on Tuesday as the first woman of colour to serve as running mate on a main-party US presidential ticket. Profile: Who is Kamala Harris? Why Kamala Harris embraces her biracial roots How Kamala Harris could help - or hurt - Joe Biden She is deputy to Democratic White House candidate Joe Biden, who will challenge Mr Trump, a Republican, in November's general election. ""The VP has the same eligibility requirements as the president,"" Juliet Sorensen, a law professor at Northwestern University, told the Associated Press (AP) news agency. ""Kamala Harris, she has to be a natural-born citizen, at least 35 years old, and a resident in the United States for at least 14 years. She is. That's really the end of the inquiry."" Anyone born in the US and subject to its jurisdiction is a natural born citizen, regardless of the citizenship of their parents, says the Cornell Legal Information Institute. The Biden campaign sent a scathing statement in response to the president stoking the false conspiracy theory. ""Donald Trump was the national leader of the grotesque, racist birther movement with respect to President Obama and has sought to fuel racism and tear our nation apart on every single day of his presidency,"" a Biden campaign spokesman said in an email. ""So it's unsurprising, but no less abhorrent, that as Trump makes a fool of himself straining to distract the American people from the horrific toll of his failed coronavirus response that his campaign and their allies would resort to wretched, demonstrably false lies in their pathetic desperation."" After a conservative law professor questioned Ms Harris' eligibility based on her parents' immigration status at the time of her birth, Mr Trump was asked about the argument at a press conference on Thursday. The president said: ""I just heard it today that she doesn't meet the requirements and by the way the lawyer that wrote that piece is a very highly qualified, very talented lawyer. This video can not be played Who is Kamala Harris, vice-president? ""I have no idea if that's right. I would have assumed the Democrats would have checked that out before she gets chosen to run for vice-president. ""But that's a very serious, you're saying that, they're saying that she doesn't qualify because she wasn't born in this country."" The reporter replied there was no question that Ms Harris was born in the US, simply that her parents might not have been permanent US residents at the time. Earlier on Thursday, a Trump campaign adviser, Jenna Ellis, reposted a tweet from the head of conservative group Judicial Watch, Tim Fitton. This video can not be played Kamala Harris' childhood home reacts to Biden pick In that tweet, Mr Fitton questioned whether Ms Harris was ""ineligible to be vice-president under the US constitution's 'citizenship clause'"". He also sharedthe opinion piece published in Newsweek,externalmagazine by John Eastman, a law professor at Chapman University in California, that Mr Trump was asked about. Prof Eastman cites Article II of the US Constitution's wording that ""no person except a natural born citizenâ¦ shall be eligible to the office of president"". He also points out that the 14th Amendment to the constitution says ""all persons bornâ¦ in the United States, and subject to the jurisdiction thereof, are citizens"". This video can not be played A look back at Joe Biden's life and political career Prof Eastman's argument, which he claims is also being made by other ""commentators"", hinges on the idea that Ms Harris may not have been subject to US jurisdiction if her parents were, for example, on student visas at the time of their daughter's birth in California. ""Her father was (and is) a Jamaican national, her mother was from India, and neither was a naturalized US citizen at the time of Harris' birth in 1964. That, according to these commentators, makes her not a 'natural born citizen' - and therefore ineligible for the office of the president and, hence, ineligible for the office of the vice president."" In 2010, Prof Eastman ran to be the Republican candidate for California attorney general. He lost to Steve Cooley, who went on to be defeated by Ms Harris, the Democratic candidate, in the general election. Following furious backlash to the Newsweek op-ed, its editor-in-chief Nancy Cooper stood by the decision to publish, arguing on Thursday that Prof Eastman's article had ""nothing to do with racist birtherism"" and was instead ""focusing on a long-standing, somewhat arcane legal debate"". Berkeley Law School Dean Erwin Chemerinsky told CBS News, the BBC's US partner, that Prof Eastman's argument about Ms Harris' eligibility was ""truly silly"". He wrote in an email: ""Under section 1 of the 14th Amendment, anyone born in the United States is a United States citizen. ""The Supreme Court has held this since the 1890s. Kamala Harris was born in the United States."" Laurence Tribe, a constitutional law professor at Harvard University and frequent critic of President Trump, called Prof Eastman's argument ""garbage"" and ""racist birtherism redux"". Jessica Levinson, a professor at Loyola Law School, told AP: ""Let's just be honest about what it is: It's just a racist trope we trot out when we have a candidate of colour whose parents were not citizens."" Back in 2011, Mr Trump began stoking right-wing theories that President Obama might have been born in Kenya. Even when Mr Obama produced a copy of his birth certificate in April that year showing he was born in Hawaii, Mr Trump continued to claim it was a ""fraud"". This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""Hillary Clinton... started the ""birther"" controversy During a September 2016 press conference, Mr Trump, then the Republican White House candidate, was asked about the matter. He sought to take credit for dispelling doubts over Mr Obama's eligibility, telling reporters: ""I finished it. President Obama was born in the United States. Period."" Mr Trump also argued in 2016 that his Republican rival Ted Cruz was not eligible to run for president because he was born in Canada to a US citizen mother and a Cuban-born father.

Labour call for urgent u-turn over 'exams fiasco',"There has been widespread concern about the fairness of the 'calculated' results Labour has called on ministers to act immediately to sort out an ""exams fiasco"" in England and stop thousands of A-level students being ""betrayed"". It said it was unacceptable that a ""flawed system"" had led to 280,000 pupils having their marks downgraded. Sir Keir Starmer said ministers must follow the lead of Scotland and allow teacher assessed marks to be accepted. Ministers say this risks ""grade inflation"" and disadvantaged pupils had not been disproportionately affected. But some Tory MPs have challenged the fairness of how grades have been decided. Schools North East, representing over 1,100 schools in the north east of England, also backed the use of teacher assessments. Why did the A-level algorithm say no? Anger over 'unfair' A-level results What's next in the arguments over exam results? Oxford college will uphold offers despite A-level grades But they said if that was not possible there needed to be a much more rapid and transparent way for schools to appeal, saying that using mock grades or relying on autumn exams was inadequate. In London a group of protestors gathered outside 10, Downing Street to express their anger at the results while petitions, calling for more weight to be given to teacher assessments, gained tens of thousands of signatures. Protestors angry at the exam grading system gathered outside 10, Downing Street on Friday After exams were cancelled due to the pandemic, grades were awarded using a controversial modelling system, with the key factors being the ranking order of pupils and the previous exam results of schools and colleges. This produced more top grades than have ever been seen before in A-levels, with almost 28% getting A* and As, but head teachers have been angry about ""unfathomable"" individual injustices in the downgrading of some results. This year's A-level results are higher than even before In England, 36% of entries had grades lower than their teacher assessments and 3% were down two grades. There are now calls to switch away from this system and to use teacher assessments, in the way that the government U-turned in Scotland. But England's exam watchdog Ofqual has warned that using teachers' estimates would have artificially inflated results - and would have seen about 38% of entries getting A*s and As. Labour said the lack of consistency in individual results was ""heartbreaking"" for those affected and the government was squarely to blame for sticking with a ""fatally flawed results system"". ""Across the last 24 hours the scale of the injustice has become clear,"" said Sir Keir. ""Young people and parents right across the country, in every town and city, feel let down and betrayed. ""The unprecedented and chaotic circumstances created by the UK government's mishandling of education during recent months mean that a return to teacher assessments is now the best option available,"" said the Labour leader. ""No young person should be at a detriment due to government incompetence."" Labour's education spokeswoman Kate Green also called for appeals to be able to be made by individual students, not only through schools. The Equalities and Human Rights Commission has urged the exams regulator Ofqual to consider the equality impacts of all their actions and mitigate against any potential negative affect on disadvantaged and minority groups. EHRC Chief Executive, Rebecca Hilsenrath, called on the watchdog to publish a full breakdown of the differences between teacher assessed grades and the final grade. ""Students who have been downgraded must be able to appeal directly if they believe their grades are unfair,"" she said. Figures from Ofqual showed independent schools had disproportionately benefited from the rise in top grades - up by five percentage points, compared with two percentage points for comprehensives and 0.3 percentage points for further education colleges. Northern Ireland: Minister must act 'decisively' on exam results Wales: Labour backbench revolt against A-level downgrading The chairman of the Education Select Committee, Tory MP Robert Halfon, urged Ofqual to ""explain properly how their model has worked and whether it has been fair"". Mr Halfon also said exam appeals ""should be no cost"" to students. Writing on his website, the former children's minister Tim Loughton said the results had been ""extraordinarily distressing"" for some students and urged ministers to ""look at the algorithm again for those who have missed out on their place in further education"". Another, Tory MP. Robert Syms, asked the government to ""go on teacher recommendation"" arguing that grade inflation would be less unfair than failing students who did not have the chance to take exams. And Conservative Peer, Lord Porter of Spalding, called the process for awarding grades ""shambolic"" and said it made him ashamed to be a member of the party. Lord Porter also criticised fees for appeals which can be more than Â£100 for an unsuccessful appeal. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has defended what he said were a ""robust set"" of grades and said that pupils who believed they were treated unfairly would be able to appeal or, if they wanted, sit exams in the autumn. Schools can appeal for an upgrade if their pupils' mock grades were higher than their allocated results. But the exam regulator Ofqual has still to say how a mock exam result can be validated - and head teachers have warned that mocks are not standardised or taken by all pupils, and could not be used as a fair way of deciding final exam results. Speaking on BBC Breakfast, Transport Minister Grant Shapps rejected suggestions this year's exam system had been tougher on students from poorer backgrounds. ""More students from disadvantaged backgrounds are going to university and overall we've got more accepted to university than previously as well,"" said Mr Shapps. The latest figures from the Ucas admissions service do not show any significant increase in students deferring for a year. There will still be places to be decided through clearing, but so far almost 430,000 places have been accepted. What's next in the arguments over exam results?

Survivor walked mile to raise fatal train alarm,"A derailment which left three people dead happened after the train struck a landslip covering the track,the Rail Accident Investigation Branch has said,external. The driver, conductor and a passenger died when the 06:38 Aberdeen to Glasgow service crashed near Stonehaven. The RAIB said the train had turned back towards Aberdeen after reports of a landslip further down the track. The six-vehicle train had travelled more than a mile when it was derailed after hitting a separate landslip. The track curved to the right, but investigators said the train continued in a straight line for about 100 yards before hitting the parapet of a bridge. Are we doing enough to modernise infrastructure? Tributes paid to three killed in train derailment What we know about the Stonehaven derailment The locomotive at the front of the train continued over the bridge and fell down an embankment, as did the third passenger carriage. The first passenger carriage came to rest on its roof, at right angles to the track, with the second passenger carriage on top of it. The fourth passenger carriage remained upright and also came to rest on top of the first carriage. It was still attached to the rear locomotive. The RAIB said the train had left Stonehaven station and passed Carmont on Wednesday morning when it was stopped by a signaller who had received a report of a landslip further along the track. The decision was taken to return to Aberdeen, and the train was routed back over a crossover at Carmont. The RAIB said it was collecting evidence on the cause and consequences of the accident. It will examine the sequence of events and the actions of those involved, as well as the management of earthworks and drainage in the area, including recent inspections and risk assessments. Tributes have been paid to Brett McCullough, Donald Dinnie and Chris Stuchbury Simon French, chief inspector of the RAIB, said: ""Thankfully, fatal derailments are a rare occurrence on the UK's national network. ""However, landslips and other earthworks failures remain a risk to trains that needs to be constantly managed - and this is becoming even more challenging for the rail industry due to the increasing incidence of extreme weather events."" Driver Brett McCullough, conductor Donald Dinnie and passenger Christopher Stuchbury died in the crash. On Thursday, their families told of their devastation at their deaths. In a fresh tribute on Friday, the Roxburghe House hospice in Aberdeen where Mr Stuchbury volunteered in his spare time said he was ""incredibly caring"". And two police officers from British Transport Police laid flowers in tribute to the men who died. The officers, who knew Mr McCullough and Mr Dinnie for many years, had gone to the scene from their homes as soon as they heard the news. Prince Charles thanked emergency responders for their bravery when he visited the crash site on Friday. He met some of those among the first on the scene, including Pc Liam Mercer and Pc Eilidh McCabe. Police Scotland Chief Inspector Kevin Walker said the visit by was ""very much appreciated by everyone"" and those on scene were ""grateful for the genuine interest he showed in hearing about their experiences"". It earlier emerged that an off-duty rail worker walked a mile to raise the alarm after surviving the accident. Prince Charles visited the scene of the crash on Friday The prince met emergency responders who were among the first on the scene Transport Secretary Michael Mathesontold BBC Scotland's The Ninethat a ""number of actions"" were taken after the derailment to raise the alarm. He said: ""There was a call made by someone who believed that an incident had taken place locally and they contacted Police Scotland. ""There was also an off-duty railway person on the train who, after it derailed, walked around a mile to the next signal box and advised them that an incident had occurred, which allowed Network Rail at its national control centre to close the line. ""During the course of that, Police Scotland obviously dispatched their staff and Network Rail dispatched some of the staff that they had working nearby to respond to the incident."" UK Transport Minister Grant Shapps has asked Network Rail to produce an interim report by 1 September. Network Rail said it would carry out detailed inspections of high-risk trackside slopes with similar characteristics to the site of the Aberdeenshire crash. Dozens of sites across Britain will be assessed using in-house engineers, specialist contractors and helicopter surveys. Scotland's Lord Advocate has asked Police Scotland, British Transport Police and the Office of Rail and Road, the independent regulator, to conduct a joint investigation into the accident. This will run in parallel with the independent safety investigation being carried out by the RAIB. Are we doing enough to modernise infrastructure?

"'We were all packed, then they cancelled'Hundreds of would-be holidaymakers are finding their bookings have been cancelled at the last minute.","James and his wife, Georgina, both key workers worked long days through lockdown. By the end of July they were more than ready for their holiday. ""We were literally all packed, kids had their rucksacks,"" says James. ""Half the stuff was in the car."" They were just about to set out on the four hour drive to Alder Country Park in Norfolk, when the phone rang. The holiday that they booked before Christmas was no longer available. ""I was shell-shocked,"" says James. ""We said, how can it not be available? We booked it last year."" Their eldest daughter is in a wheelchair so they plan well ahead to ensure they find somewhere that can accommodate her needs. But they were told that a maintenance problem at the lodge they'd booked meant it was cancelled. In a normal year Hoseasons, the firm through which it had been booked, says it would have tried to find them an alternative, but with demand for UK holidays sky high this year, everywhere was fully booked. ""I came off the phone and said 'sorry kids, no holiday', says James. The younger ones burst into tears. They aren't alone. Dozens of holiday-makers have contacted BBC Radio 4's You and Yours programme to say their holiday has been cancelled at short notice. A Facebook page set up by disgruntled Hoseasons customers has more than 500 members. Rod Leaman booked a four night stay at the Welcome Family Holiday Park in Devon through Hoseasons in February. Less than a fortnight before he was due to go he received an e-mail saying that his booking had been cancelled as the dates he'd chosen were no longer available. Where can I now go on holiday in the UK? When Mr Leaman phoned the holiday park itself, he was told that when it reopened in July the owners had decided not to take bookings for less than a week. ""I would happily have paid for the extra three nights, but that option wasn't given to me,"" he says. The booking was for his daughter Claire so she could get away for a holiday with her partner and her fifteen-year-old daughter Rayah. Some disappointed holidaymakers were given no explanation at all. Jill Turner, a teacher from Poole in Dorset, received a text message from Hoseasons, apologising for cancelling the caravan she'd booked for four nights in mid-August. It took Jill an hour to get through to the company on the phone, she says. Even then, she says they didn't offer any reason why they couldn't honour her reservation. After the BBC looked into Jill's case, Hoseasons admitted the caravan had been double-booked. 'It was for Claire and Rayah', says Rod Leaman of the holiday he booked. ""I'm really disappointed about the whole situation, that a company who we thought we could trust... that they could send an 'oh we are sorry', when they weren't"", says Jill. ""What was really annoying was that no-one actually seemed to care."" Hoseasons told the BBC that double-bookings had occurred in a small number of cases because of the large volume of bookings and rebookings taking place as lockdown was eased. Hoseasons is part of the holiday rental company, the Awaze group. The group also owns Cottages.com, many of whose customers have reported similar last-minute cancellations. Children's author Michael Rosen was one of them.  He spent 47 days on a ventilator after being admitted to hospital with coronavirus in March. As he finally began to recover, his wife Emma-Louise Williams booked and paid in full for a week's holiday at a cottage in Somerset. But four days before they were due to leave, Cottages.com contacted them to cancel their booking, saying the property was no longer available for the dates she had booked. Author Michael Rosen and producer Emma-Louise Williams were looking forward to a holiday after his long battle with coronavirus Emma-Louise was later told by the key-holder of the property that it had been double-booked. The holiday firm promised a full refund within 3 to 5 days, as well as Â£250 in compensation. On 31st July, the day James and his family were told their holiday was cancelled, Henrik Kjellberg chief executive of Awaze UK published a letter of apology to customers. ""Though we expected demand to resurface as UK travel restrictions were lifted, we didn't plan for a tenfold increase, which is what we've experienced on some of our platforms in recent weeks,"" he wrote. ""To put it simply - our systems didn't scale to the level we needed them to and this regrettably caused some duplicate bookings to occur."" The firm says as well as the technical glitch there have been a handful of other reasons for cancellations. Hoseasons doesn't own the properties it takes bookings for and says some became unavailable after owners decided to withdraw them, either to use them themselves, or as a result of concerns around Covid-19. Bookings for UK holidays have surged due to the coronavirus pandemic The firm says late cancellations have affected less than 1% of bookings in July and August and those affected will be promptly refunded. But customers who contacted the BBC and joined the Facebook site said it has been hard to get hold of Hoseasons to arrange a refund. The firm says it will be adding further capacity by hiring more staff for its contact centre. James and Georgina, who paid the full Â£1,500 bill for their holiday back in January, have been told they will get some compensation, but they haven't yet received it or their money back. They are still angry and feel they are owed an explanation. Countrywide, which owns Alder Country Park, says the maintenance issue at the lodge, caused by a hot tub, was only identified on the day James and Georgina were due to arrive. Countrywide apologised for the late cancellation. James says he still feels like he's in limbo, but in hindsight it is less about the money than the disappointment. ""It's been tough for everyone - during what's happened in lockdown. It's been tough for Hoseasons, I get that. What I don't get is just dropping it on us with five hours' notice.

âRaise sick payâ to lower virus risk,"Statutory sick pay should be increased and the furlough scheme extended on a flexible basis, new research suggests. Doing so would better manage a ""crude"" trade-off between lives and livelihoods as the UK economy reopens. These are two of the recommendations in a new report from the Royal Society. It says economic and health data should be combined to produce the best economic outcome at the smallest loss of life. The government says it has already protected 9.6 million jobs. The report by Professors Sir Tim Besley and Sir Nicholas Stern warns that an abrupt and premature easing of restrictions would lead to a second wave of infections that would mean both a higher death toll and ultimately a greater hit to the economy. The report is published a day after data showed the UK suffered the biggest economic hit of the world's richest nations between April and June while also incurring the highest number of excess deaths to date in Europe. It argues that as the furlough scheme - which has supported the wages of 9.6 million workers - is phased out, statutory sick pay of Â£95.85 a week is a major disincentive for workers to self-isolate. This, in turn, makes efforts to successfully implement Track Trace and Isolate schemes almost impossible. A review of sick pay policy along with the extension of a more flexible furlough scheme would help mitigate both health and economic risks. The blanket phasing out of the current furlough scheme across all sectors by October is not sufficiently sensitive to the risks of a second wave of infections, the report argues. ""I think the furlough scheme in its current form is almost certainly going to have to be modified to be more targeted towards occupations that can't resume anywhere near their normal level of activity,"" said Sir Tim Besley, professor of economics at the London School of Economics and co-author of the report. ""If people are being asked to self-isolate they need to be cushioned against the economic consequences of that"". Professors Stern and Besley also recommend minimising the rotation of staff between different shifts and the introduction of subsidised workplace testing - particularly in sectors where close contact is hard to avoid. Combining economic and health data to optimise policy response will require high quality data and the report encourages the gathering of more detailed information from financial institutions to track the economic impact of policy interventions. Without it, the report says, the UK risks repeating its experience of suffering the worst of both worlds. The government insists it has protected jobs and offered help to those needing it. ""We've protected more than 9.6 million jobs through the furlough scheme, supported more than two million self-employed people and paid out billions in loans and grants to thousands of businesses,"" a Government spokesperson said. ""And for those in most need, we've provided an unprecedented package of support including injecting Â£9.3bn into the welfare system, mortgage holidays and additional help for renters. ""We've also made sick pay payable from day one and will refund employers with up to 250 staff the cost of up to a fortnight's sick pay. Employers can, and many do, pay more than the statutory rate - something we encourage.""

'I regret atom bombs but they are why I'm alive',"Jack Ransom regrets that atoms bombs were dropped to end World War Two but says without them he would not have survived to be 100. His uncle, whose name he shares, had died during World War One at the age of 19 and Jack says he could easily have not survived the brutal treatment at the hands of the Japanese if World War Two had not been brought to a final conclusion on 15 August 1945. Jack was standing at the gates of Changi jail in Singapore when he discovered his ordeal was over. He had been a prisoner of the Japanese for more than three years, during which time he had been forced to build the infamous Burma railway and carry out other punishing work on rations of just a bowl of rice a day. When he was liberated he knew nothing of VE Day four months earlier, which marked the end of the war in Europe. He was also unaware that Japan had finally surrendered after atom bombs were dropped on the cities of Hiroshima and Nagasaki. All the 25-year-old artilleryman knew was that the Japanese guards who took him every day to work on digging defence tunnels had failed to turn up. ""The first sign that I had was a paratrooper walking up the road towards the jail,"" he said. It was from him that Jack learned the war was finally over. Jack weighed just six stones and describes himself as looking like a scarecrow, dressed in rags and no shoes. Seventy-five years on, he says he was ""bloody lucky"" to survive his horrendous punishment as a prisoner of war. The veteran, who is originally from Peckham in London but has lived in Largs for many years, had joined 118 Field Regiment Royal Artillery at the start of the war but did not leave Britain until November 1941. He left from Liverpool for Halifax, Nova Scotia, where he transferred to an American troop ship and sailed to South America and across to South Africa. America was not officially in the war when they set off but while the convoy was in Cape Town the Japanese bombed Pearl Harbour, bringing the US into the conflict. Jack went to India before sailing to Singapore in January 1942. ""Our job was to use the guns to fire on the Japanese who at the time were across the straits in the Malaya peninsula. ""It was jungle on the other side so whether you hit anything or not you don't know."" British soldiers were told to surrender in Singapore On 15 February 1942, Jack was told to surrender because of the heavy punishment the main town on the island was taking. The troops were ordered to destroy as much as they could before the Japanese arrived and took them prisoner. Jack was taken to Changi prison camp in Singapore but at the beginning of 1943 he was sent to work on the Burma railway, often called the Death Railway. About 12,000 Allied prisoners died during the construction of the railway that ran 250 miles between Thailand and Burma (now Myanmar), to supply troops and weapons in Japan's Burma campaign. Jack says he was one of the final groups to be sent to the railway and thousands had already died from cholera and other diseases. He was forced to march about 200 miles from the start of the railway to where they were to work building an embankment. ""We lost people along the way,"" he says. ""They fell by the wayside and died. They just left them."" ""It was a hard job,"" Jack says. ""The embankments were 6ft or 8ft high. We had to scoop earth up and build them up. We had no machinery it was just four men and two shovels."" British Troops tried in vain to stop the Japanese at Singapore The Japanese were brutal, he says, and the prisoners worked from dawn to dusk with hardly any rations. ""We lived on a mess tin of rice per day,"" he says. ""That's all we got."" After the railway was finished at the end of 1943 he was taken back to Changi jail in Singapore where he did more hard labour digging defence tunnels or levelling land for the airport. Then one morning in August 1945 it ended. Jack says the gates to the jail were open but nobody knew what to do. ""After three years of being a prisoner of war you weren't going to stick your nose out of the door and get your head shot off,"" he says. It was the paratrooper who confirmed the news that they had dropped the atom bombs and the war was over. A month later he got his transport home. Jack says he started the journey on the Polish boat at six stone and arrived home 12 stone. ""They gave us bacon eggs and bread and butter,"" he says. ""I dreamed of a slice of bread and butter."" The events of 75 years are still fresh in Jack's memory.

Heathrow warns of quarantine impact,"Heathrow Airport's boss has warned quarantine restrictions are ""strangling the UK economy"", and renewed calls for Covid-19 testing at airports. Thousands of jobs are being lost because Britain is being cut off from key markets, said chief executive John Holland-Kaye. The warning came as Heathrow reported passenger traffic in July plunged 88%. The government has said previously that coronavirus testing at airports is not a ""silver bullet"". Heathrow said that more than half of its 860,000 passengers in July had travelled to quarantine-free European destinations. However, it said that the ""vast majority"" of its route network remains grounded due to quarantine rules. The government recently re-imposed quarantine restrictions on arrivals from Spain, Luxembourg, Belgium, the Bahamas, and Andorra. And there have been reports there could be restrictions imposed on travel to France. In a statement on Tuesday, Heathrow said the 14-day quarantine restrictions on many passengers arriving in the UK were ""preventing the UK from travelling to and trading with"" some countries. UK employment falls by biggest amount in a decade UK 'won't hesitate' to add to quarantine list Mr Holland-Kaye said: ""Tens of thousands of jobs are being lost because Britain remains cut off from critical markets such as the US, Canada and Singapore. ""The government can save jobs by introducing testing to cut quarantine from higher risk countries, while keeping the public safe from a second wave of Covid."" After lockdown restrictions eased in the UK,bookings for cottages, caravan sites and holiday parks soared. Government ministers have said airport testing would not stop the need for quarantine However, the hotel industry has been hit hard by coronavirus lockdowns and travel restrictions. Holiday Inn owner IHG said on Tuesday that it had made a loss before tax of $275m (Â£210m) in the six months to 30 June. Keith Barr, IHG chief executive, said: ""The impact of Covid-19 on our business has been substantial."" But he said there were ""small but steady improvements in occupancy"" into July. The travel industry has been pushing for quarantine-free travel to areas in countries that haven't been affected by increases in coronavirus cases, and for airport testing. But UK Culture Secretary Oliver Dowden said in July thattesting at airports would not stop the need for quarantine, because the virus could develop over time. This was after the UK government re-imposed quarantine restrictions on travellers coming to the UK from Spain, and after it updated travel advice, recommending against all non-essential travel to the country and its islands. Last week, Chancellor Rishi Sunak said the governmentwould not hesitateto add more countries to its quarantine list when asked whether France could also join it. Also last week, Bank of England Governor Andrew Bailey said theUK economy was rebounding faster than it had assumed in Mayafter a ""more rapid"" pick-up in consumer spending. However, the Bank warned of a ""material"" rise in unemployment this year as it held interest rates at 0.1%. The latest unemployment figures show that between April and June,employment in the UK fell by the largest amount in more than a decade.

Sportswomen share experiences of sexism,"Almost two-thirds of elite British female athletes have experienced sexism in sport but the vast majority did not feel able to report it. In theBBC Elite British Sportswomen's survey, 65% of respondents had suffered sexism, but only 10% reported it. The figures have worsened over the past five years since the last survey was carried out. In 2015, 41% had suffered sexism, with 7% reporting it. Athletes said they did not know who to report it to, and that their mostly male coaches would not understand or take them seriously. They did not think it would make a difference anyway and would involve significant sacrifice. Women feel their chances of selection for teams or events would be harmed if they stood up and spoke out against sexism. So here are the stories of four women and the sexism they have faced, all anonymised so that speaking up does not mean losing out. A golfer shares her experiences of sexism while playing in pro-ams, where a professional plays with male amateurs who are sometimes affiliated with sponsors of a tournament. ""It's the perpetual comments on your physique. I've had guys jokingly propose to me on the second hole and then do it again five holes later, then again on the next hole, to the point that it gets awkward, uncomfortable and too persistent. ""It's not appropriate for the context and environment that we're in. It's disrespectful - it should be about my golf, not those sorts of things. ""There are always questions like: 'Do you have a boyfriend? How's your dating life?' Things that they probably wouldn't ask guys. ""I've had a few experiences like that in pro-ams. It's frustrating. There's not really anything you can do or say about it because they're sponsors. ""A lot of the time they're people who are literally allowing you to play in this event and make a living. They kind of take advantage of that a bit. We're so reliant on these people. ""There's nothing we can do without fear of losing sponsorship or losing future opportunities. If you stand up for yourself, they're just going to be like: 'Oh, she's no fun.' You have to tread very carefully. ""For the most part, in terms of sexism in women's golf, the people we come into contact with are super supportive of women's golf. ""It's more the outside people looking in who don't understand it. That's where the issues lie. ""It isn't every time. I have had some incredible pro-am experiences that I wouldn't change. It's just a couple of times a year. You know as soon as you get on the first tee if it's going to be a rough one. ""I know the other girls in the field are experiencing the same thing so I'm sure there are a couple of us every week that experience some form of inappropriateness and disrespect that is frustrating."" An Olympic gold medallist explains how she felt when she discovered a less high-profile male athlete was getting paid more than her by the same sponsor. ""There was a male player who was with the same sponsor and got paid a lot more money than me. ""He was famous in his own right but in my opinion, and I said this to them, on a digital platform in terms of promoting the brand he doesn't have social media, he doesn't do many talks. ""If you look at value as a person - he's an amazing person. But value as a business: it wasn't the same, especially after I won an Olympic gold medal. ""So I made the decision to move sponsors for less money out of principle. I quickly found out that one of the male athletes was on double the amount I was on. ""When I found out a person who at that point hadn't achieved anything was on double what I was, I very quickly left. ""I went back to the original sponsor who upped my contract and apologised, which they admitted they should have done in the first place. ""It was very frustrating. In our sport, men are still getting more money, bigger sponsorships and I don't understand why. There isn't any reason for it - it's literally because they are men."" An athlete speaks about a time when she represented her country at a stadium usually used by men, meaning the toilet facilities were not functional for women. ""As nice as the changing room is - it's spacious, there's a hot tub, ice bath, everything going - there's one cubicle toilet. We're talking 26-28 people with one cubicle. I love playing there and you feel so welcome as a team, but there's one cubicle. ""You literally have to change the schedule to allow time for people to go to the toilet. Everyone needs to go before we warm up and when you come in from the warm-up. ""But what do you do? You don't want to call off the whole match because there's only one cubicle. I don't really want portaloos either because you're playing international sport. ""It's things like that - it's become normal to accept it."" An elite sportswoman who represents England describes how coaches favour male players and why she feels powerless to stop it. ""The ideas of the past - that the men's game is more physical and more interesting, that they are pushing the boundaries - are still in place because coaches have been in place for years and years. ""The men get put on the main training areas and the coaches will mill around those areas and the women will be put on the side to carry on the routines but not really get the feedback and the coaching input. ""We've had some women's squad sessions which have highlighted how much previously it was tailored to the men's side of the game. We realised how different things can be and how much value we can get. ""It's brilliant that they are trying to change but the system is so ingrained with this male dominance. I'm not even sure they are aware that they do it, it's just an everyday occurrence but as a woman playing in that sport it's disheartening to see. ""I have at times said that things weren't acceptable and that men are saying derogatory things to women but it has not been taken seriously. ""It was the whole: 'Oh, you're a feminist, you're undermining us, you just have women's rights ahead and you don't take a balanced approach on it.' ""I'm quite happy to keep saying these things aren't fair but with the coaches it's different - because they are your selectors. ""And unfortunately, as much as you don't like the system you have to roll with the system because they are the people who are going to be selecting you for your country. ""When I'm out of the system and I'm finished I would like to think I'd be able to say more things about how I didn't like the way we were treated and how I couldn't say so at the time because of fear of the end of progression of my career. ""You have to be in favour because as soon you're out - regardless of your results - there is always a reason not to select you. You have to be at the top of your game to have any power."" Here is a selection of other anonymous responses given in the sexism section of the survey: I had a previous national coach who was completely sexist and I was bullied I believe for being female, which was reported and brushed under the carpet by another male. I have personally been jeered and laughed at for being a female rugby player at different clubs from the crowd. Clubs I have played at have declined to let my team use the main field despite being one of the top competing teams in the league, and not washed kit or refused to let us use changing rooms or provide female hygiene facilities or food after games. Men are paid more than women at the club even though the women outperform the men at the same level in the sport. Men are also given priority on facility use, finance, travel, spectator slots, promotion etc. The owner of the club labelled himself as ""a sexist pig"" so I don't see much point in  reporting it and don't want to reduce funding to the women further. We are not allowed in the gym when the men are in there or not allowed in the same room as the men even though we play for the same team and represent the same country . Referees making women play to junior rules, coaches not treating us with the same respect as men, spectators saying rugby would get more crowds if we played in sport bras and hot pants, people asking about showers after games. I don't report it because it never gets heard or nothing is done about it. Sometimes challenging it just fuels the fire. On occasions male coaches that thought I was pretty would inappropriately express that to me when in a position of power. I didn't want to annoy or get my manager in trouble in case I wouldn't be selected. I have been in the situation in the past where a male coach showed a lot of interest in my sport and gave me a lot of advice so I felt really supported, motivated and I improved a lot. Then after a year of this, there was an occasion where I did not reciprocate his advances and then after that the advice and help stopped and I did feel very demotivated by that. Sexism is one of many issues raised by the BBC Elite British Sportswomen's Survey. BBC Sport will be shining a spotlight on the others with coverage throughout the week on the BBC Sport website, BBC Radio 5 Live and BBC TV. More information can be foundhere.

Will I get my money back if I can't go on holiday?,"The newly identified Omicron variant of Covid has led to more disruption for international travellers. Quarantine is being reintroduced for people arriving from some African countries, flights have been cancelled and PCR tests will be mandatory within 48 hours of arrival to the UK from 30 November. If the government announces that travel to a particular country is not advised, then airlines and travel companies are likely to cancel any pre-booked flights or holidays there. For example, that is already the case for some flights to and from South Africa as a result of risks associated with the Omicron variant. What are the UK's new travel rules? If your flight is cancelled, you are entitled to a full refund and you can choose to receive that refund in cash rather than as a voucher. An airline should refund the money within seven days, although some people have waited longer. A package holiday should be refunded, in full, within 14 days. This is far less clear-cut. If you cancel, rather than your travel provider, then you have no automatic right to a refund. In this situation, it is worth contacting the airline/holiday provider to see what options you have. EasyJet, for example, has announced that it will extend its ""freedom to change"" service - which allows passengers to change flights up to two hours before departure for free  - until 31 March, 2022. Some may charge a fee to transfer to another date or destination, but some may allow it without charging a fee. You would have to pay the difference if the alternative flight is more expensive. They may give you a voucher, or they may allow you to cancel and get a refund. That may be trickier, according to Rory Boland, travel editor at Which? who said that the property's specific policy will determine whether refunds would be given. ""If your trip is several weeks or months away, travellers should at this stage do nothing as the situation may change,"" he said. ""Those booking a trip should do so through holiday providers with good, flexible booking policies in case it cannot go ahead."" People who have booked a package holiday will be refunded in full, including accommodation, if it is cancelled by the operator. Operators do not have to refund you if you are unexpectedly forced to self-isolate. It is best to study their policies before booking, or see whether they can offer some support if you have already booked and want to cancel. Travel insurers are offering different levels of cover. In part, this depends on how much you pay for a policy. The majority, but not all, will pay out if you test positive for Covid and have to cancel before you travel. Importantly, if the Foreign Office advises against travel to a country - as it is for some in southern Africa at the moment, then all but a handful of travel insurance policies would be invalid if you still decide to go. Rules are inevitably going to be complex, given the risk of Covid varies so much between countries. The government haspublished a charter,externalthat ""clearly sets out consumer rights and responsibilities when booking travel while Covid-19 measures remain in place"". It says it expects travel operators to be ""flexible"" with customers, given the circumstances, and theCompetition and Markets Authority (CMA) has warned package holiday firmsthey must stick to refund rules. â¨ How are travel rules being relaxed?

New Covid rules in force for bars and restaurantsTaking customers' details and infection control measures are now mandatory for Scotland's hospitality sector.Scotland,"Bars and restaurants should be providing table service and taking contact details Bars and restaurants in Scotland are now required by law to collect customers' contact details. Guidance such as providing table service, pre-booking and avoiding customers standing together or queuing is also now mandatory. There should be no background music and TVs should be muted so that people do not have to lean in to be heard. The Scottish government said police and local environmental health teams would enforce the rules if necessary. Announcing the measures last week, First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said the outbreak in Aberdeen and elsewhere had underlined how coronavirus could easily be spread in settings such as pubs. On Friday, Ms Sturgeon confirmed that 198 cases were now associated with the cluster and, to date, 1,032 contacts had so far been identified. The first minister also said 28 of the 65 new cases in Scotland were detected by NHS Grampian. Tighter rules on visors, masks and contacts During her daily media briefing she said: ""We know that pubs and restaurants are higher risk locations for transmission of Covid and we are seeing that reflected in out data right now."" Ms Sturgeon also urged people to limit the number of pubs they visited in one day and warned that customers who refused to provide their details should not be served. She said: ""The more settings you go to the more likely you will be to get Covid and the more likely you might be to spread it."" And Ms Sturgeon stressed that the Aberdeen outbreak emphasised the threat still posed by the virus. She added: ""Nobody's life should be feeling absolutely normal yet. Nobody's social life should feel exactly as it was before Covid struck."" However, Ms Sturgeon said the possibility of allowing ""acceptable decibel levels"" for TVs and music was being examined. It emerged on Friday that a restaurant in East Renfrewshire had closed after a positive coronavirus case was linked to it. NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde said anyone who visited the Ca Va Brasserie in Giffnock from mid-afternoon onwards on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday should look out for symptoms associated with the virus, such as a fever or persistent cough. A spokesman for the restaurant said: ""A member of staff tested positive for Covid-19. As soon as this was discovered we closed the restaurant and arranged for a thorough clean. ""The safety of staff and customers is our absolute priority, and we won't reopen until that can be assured."" The hospitality sector had already been urged to take customers' contact details to allow the Test and Protect system of contact tracing to function While many businesses had complied with the guidance, Ms Sturgeon earlier said others had not and it was therefore necessary to tighten the rules. The first minister said putting the guidance on a statutory basis, meaning it was backed up by law, would ""help to clarify exactly what is required of the hospitality industry"". Businesses were given seven days to prepare for the new tighter rules but were urged to act sooner to ensure the guidance was being followed. Contact details may be kept by businesses for 21 days after which they must be destroyed or deleted.

"Fewer hospital patients in Covid-19 hotspotsHospital admissions are not rising despite increases in coronavirus cases, according to NHS England data.","The number of people in hospital with Covid-19 fell in coronavirus hotspots in June and July, according to data released by NHS England. Cases of coronavirus have been rising nationally since the middle of July, and even earlier in Leicester. More of these cases are among young people, who are less likely to become seriously sick. A University of Oxford expert said there were ""not yet any signs of a second wave in the hospital data"". The number of people dying or going into hospital with Covid-19 has been falling across the UK for months, but since the middle of July, the number of confirmed cases has started to rise. Prof Chris Whitty, the UK's chief medical adviser, has warned that we have ""reached the limit of what we can do to open up society"" without allowing room for the virus to return. But some scientistsargue that the rise in confirmed cases could reflect more testingrather than more infections. It may still be too soon for any increase in infections to translate into more people in hospital or dying with Covid-19 nationally. But hotspots can test the theory since their numbers of cases started to increase earlier. Leicester saw worsening infection figures throughout the early summer before Health Secretary Matt Hancock announced a local lockdown at the end of the June. And Blackburn overtook Leicester as the part of the country with the highest rate of infection in July. Data released on Thursday by NHS England showed that rising cases were not matched by an increase in the number of people in hospital in the NHS trusts that serve either of these councils. The number of people admitted to hospital for the first time with Covid-19 did increase in Leicester in June, but the rise was much smaller than the rise in confirmed cases. In July, Leicester saw 1,336 cases but only seven people were admitted to hospital with Covid-19. In Blackburn, the number of infections more than doubled in July, but the number of people admitted to hospital fell from 54 in June to 13 in July. More of the cases now being detected nationally are in people aged 15-44. They are much less likely to become seriously ill or die with coronavirus. That could explain some of the UK's fall in Covid-19 hospitalisations, according to Jason Oke, a researcher at the Centre for Evidence Based Medicine at Oxford University. But ""there are not yet any signs of a second wave in the hospital data"", he says.

Thanks for joining us. Today's live page writers were: George Bowden, Joshua Cheetham, Jo Couzens, Sophie Morris and Francesca Gillett. The page was edited by Thomas Spender and Alex Therrien. Weâll soon be bringing our live page to a close, but before we go here are the main developments from today:  Oman is ending its night-time curfew as the country
continues to ease coronavirus restrictions. The ban on night-time movement will end from 15
August at 05:00 local time (02:00 BST). The curfew meant that people had to stay at home from
21:00 until 06:00. It had already been shortened as part of the lockdown
easing. Previously, people had to stay at home between 19:00 and 07:00. Oman has recorded 557 deaths and 82,743 cases,
according to data from Johns Hopkins university. Greencore workers who have tested positive for coronavirus have been told to self-isolate Earlier this week, we reported on the outbreak at a food factory in England, where nearly 300 workers tested positive. The factory in Northampton makes sandwiches for store M&S. Officials have said the outbreak was due to behaviour outside of work, such as car sharing and socialising. Now, the leader of the local council has said the outbreak is a ""huge disaster"" for the town. ""I believe if we follow guidelines as stringently as we can, we can still avoid a lockdown,"" said Jonathan Nunn. ""Let's be absolute honest, the [Greencore] outbreak is absolutely dreadful."" Northampton has become top of the list of highest weekly rates in England. The town's rate rose to  115.8 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 11 August - up from 34.7 in the previous seven days to 4 August. Read more on the sandwich factory outbreak here. ""An extra two weeks off of work is just not doable,"" says Tom Today we've been bringing you the stories of some of the people who are rushing to get back to the UK from holidays in France before 04:00 BST tomorrow. After that point,everyone returning from France will have to self-isolate. Tom Duffell, who runs a small business, decided to cut short his family holiday to Nice by four days and booked a last-minute flight home. ""We were enjoying a nice cocktail last night and suddenly a news flash pops in and a scramble to book flights,"" he told the BBC from the airport. ""I think we've managed to get my wife and one of my sons on one flight and myself and my other son on another flight. ""We've had to spend about Â£800 because we just can't afford to take two extra weeks off of work,"" added Tom, whose wife works as an NHS nurse and volunteered in an intensive care ward. He said the government should have given tourists already in France longer to prepare. ""They could have said, you know, give tourists 72 hours to return to the UK, rather than just over 24 hours and there's this mad scramble,"" he said. ""Instead we're all packed into the airport. There's huge queues, social distancing's gone out of the window."" ""We're all scrambling on to the same flight, the flights are all full. Surely that's not going to help public health, that's just going to make things worse."" Alison RobertsPortugal Correspondent, Lisbon The Portuguese Communist Party
(PCP) is preparing to receive up to 33,000 people a day at its three-day annual
festival next month. It announced the move today
after talks this week with the health authorities over precautions to prevent
the spread of the coronavirus. The party's insistence on going
ahead with the event from 4 to 6 September has come under fierce criticism in
recent weeks, as health officials struggle to bring a series of coronavirus
outbreaks in Greater Lisbon under control. The Festa do Avante! is staged
on a 30-hectare site in Amora, across the River Tagus from Lisbon, that can
normally host up to 100,000 people. It attracts music lovers who come for the
local and foreign performers as well as party members. It is a crucial source
of revenue for the party. The PCP promised that organisers would ensure ""additional protection and
prevention measures, extending still further the safety conditions guaranteed
to its visitors"". For each visitor there would be ""an area greater
than that established for beaches and which, as a rule, will be double that
which is fixed for similar spaces"" outdoors, it said. Yesterday's edition of Avante!
(Forwards), the party newspaper for which the festival is named, called on
anyone planning to go along to take a mask with them, since it will be needed
for some spaces on the site, but did not say whether masks would or would not
be required throughout. In Portugal, the wearing of
masks is currently compulsory on public transport and closed public spaces, but
not outdoors. The minority socialist
government has resisted calls to stop the event from going ahead, at a time
when all this year's music festivals have been cancelled. Speaking yesterday,
the minister of health said that Portugal's constitution forbids the banning of
political initiatives, but that there can be no exceptions to rules in place
for the pandemic. Eleven new coronavirus deathswere announced by the UK government today,,externaltaking the total to 41,358. These
are deaths for any reason within 28 days of a positive coronavirus test. Meanwhile, the total number of people who have tested positive has increased by 1,441. That's an upward trend since two weeks ago. Earlier this week the government announced it was changing the way coronavirus deaths in England are counted. That change was applied retrospectively, and reduced the overall UK death toll by more than 5,000. You can read more about the new counting method here.

the past 24 hours - the highest number since lockdown restrictions were eased. The seven-day moving average has increased to 2,041
marking the first time it has surpassed 2,000 since 20 April. Franceâs total number of cases since the pandemic
began now stands at 212,211. It comes as the UK prepares to enforce a 14-day
quarantine period topeople
arriving from France from 04:00 on Saturday. Thousands of holidaymakers are racing to return to
the UK in order to avoid the need to self-isolate. Birmingham has seen a rise in its Covid-19 infection rate Pub landlords breaking the rules around coronavirus in Birmingham are facing a police crackdown for failing to properly record customers' details. It comes amid growing concern among health chiefs about arising
infection rate in Birmingham, which puts it behind only Sandwell- the worst-affected local authority area in the West Midlands to date. Birmingham had a rate of 23.6 cases per 100,000 people in the seven days to 10 August with the trend increasing,according to NHS Digital,external. City council leader Ian Ward urged businesses to contact Public Health England as soon as they identified either a confirmed or suspected case of Covid-19 among staff or customers. Waheed Saleem, the West Midlands deputy police and crime commissioner, said: ""We will work closely with the licensing authorities to crack down on those premises that don't follow rules and are breaking rules."" Mr Saleem also warned organisers of illegal parties and raves, and those thinking of attending them: ""We will not tolerate these gatherings."" Under new restrictions bars in Athens will have to close at midnight Greeceâs Prime Minister, Kyriakos
Mitsotakis, has hit out at the countryâs young people as the country records a
rise in cases. The prime minister said âthe
spread of the virus is linked to younger agesâ as he asked people returning from
overseas to wear masks for a week after arriving back in the country and stay
away from vulnerable people. âI want to make a special appeal
to our youth. I too have children of that age,â he said. âPleaseâ¦ take care of
yourselves, you are not immune, and your parents and grandparents are
especially not immuneâ. New restrictions have been
announced in the country. Restaurants and bars will have to close from midnight
until 07:00 (04:00) in Athens, Thessaloniki and the islands of Mykonos, Santorini,
Corfu, Rhodes and Crete. The country recorded 254 cases
on Friday. Yo! Sushi has announced it will close 19 restaurants and cut 250 staff as part of a company-wide restructure. The company is launching a company voluntary arrangement, allowing it to shut loss-making sites. It said the current climate and ""changes in consumer behaviour"" meant that rents at some restaurants were unsustainable. The company's boss, Richard Hodgson, said: ""Like the rest of the sector, we need to take decisive action to adapt to the lasting changes that the covid pandemic has brought about.""

Some10
members of staff at fruit wholesalers Fyffes Group Ltd tested positive for the
virus this week- now all 186 staff are set to be tested as a precaution while the site remains open. It is the second known outbreak at a Coventry workplace this month, following nine positive cases among staff at Tesco Arena Park at the start of August. At 13.8 per 100,000 population, the number of cases for the seven West Midlands Combined Authority areas climbed slightly in the seven days up to and including 6 August. However, it is still significantly lower than rates in the worst-hit parts of the country. Council leaders at Coventry, Birmingham, Sandwell, Solihull, Dudley, Walsall and Wolverhampton have joined forces to stress the need for continued vigilance to reduce the risks of a further significant spike and local lockdown. They urged people to adhere to social distancing, in particular ahead of the return of thousands of students for the new university term. Norway has issued new
advice for mask wear in a response to a rise in cases. It is now recommended that
people using public transport in the capital, Oslo, and the region of Indre Ostfold wear
masks during rush hour. The guidance is not mandatory
and is for when people cannot maintain a one metre distance. Those travelling from the
airport after returning from countries where people must isolate have also been
advised to wear a face covering. People working in places where face-to-face
interactions cannot be avoided have also been advised to wear masks, according
to Reuters news agency. The guidance will be in place
for two weeks, Health Minister Bent Hoie said during a press conference on
Friday. Norway is one of a few countries
that had not advised people to wear masks in public. Countries such as France,
Spain and Belgium have all introduced mandatory mask policies. The ATP Tour Finals, a competition
that ends the menâs tennis season, is set to take place in London behind closed
doors. This yearâs tournament, held between 15-22
November, is the last time it will be held in London before it moves to Turin in
2021. Those who have already bought tickets
will be refunded. However, should government pilot
events go well and restrictions on live sporting events be lifted, tickets may
be sold closer to the time of the event, the ATP said. The event sees the world's top eight men's single players compete. Novak Djokovic, Rafael Nadal and
Dominic Theim are the first players to qualify for the event. Allow Instagram content? This article contains content provided by Instagram.

This video can not be played Coronavirus: Challenges of working on Senegal's Covid-19 frontline The number of daily positive tests for coronavirus in the UK is the highest it's been since 14 June, according to the latest government figures. In the 24-hour period up to 09:00 BST, there were a further 1,441 lab-confirmed cases. Overall, a total of 316,367 cases have been confirmed. Some 41,358 people have died in the UK within 28 days of testing positive for Covid-19, as of today, government figures show. This is up by 11 from Thursday. Previously, people in England who died at any point following a positive test, regardless of cause, were counted in the figures. A review of how these deaths were counted has reduced the UK death toll by more than 5,000. Separate figures published by the UK's statistics agencies indicate there have been 56,800 deaths registered in the UK where Covid-19 was mentioned on the death certificate. There are concerns that hospitals will be overstretched if the pandemic coincides with the flu season The head of the US Centers for Disease
Control and Prevention (CDC) says many regions in the country need to bring down
the number of coronavirus cases in order to stop the pandemic from coinciding with the
countryâs flu season. Director Robert Redfield said the rate of positive
test results as a proportion of the total number of tests should be below 5% or even lower,according
to Bloomberg,external. More than 30 states have reported test
positivity rates of more than 5% over the past week. There are concerns that if the
pandemic and the winter flu season coincide, hospitals could be overstretched. The CDC estimates,externalthat there were 410,000â740,000 flu hospitalisations and
24,000â64,000 deaths during the 2019-2020 winter flu season. The North Korean leader has called for the country's borders to be tighter Kim Jong-un has
ordered North Korea to reject all offers of international aid in the wake of
severe flooding, saying that it could expose people to the coronavirus. The North Korean
leader was quoted in state media telling a meeting of top officials that the countryâs
borders should be shut more tightly. North Korea says it
has no confirmed cases of the virus however health experts say they find this
difficult to believe. On Friday, a lockdown was lifted in the town of Kaesong after a suspected case of the virus. It was not announced if the suspected case was in fact Covid-19. The country has been
hit by weeks of heavy monsoon rains. More than 20 people have died and
16,000 houses have been destroyed. Oxford University'sWorcester College has confirmed it will give places to all students who were offered them,external, ""irrespective of their A-level results"". In a statement on its website, it explained the decision was taken ""in response to the uncertainties surrounding this yearâs assessment"". It said their new 2020 undergraduates are their ""most diverse cohort ever"". It comes after 280,000 pupils in England had their A-level marks downgraded, with many set to miss out on their university places. After the exams were cancelled due to the pandemic, grades were awarded using a controversial modelling system - with the key factors being the ranking order of pupils and the previous exam results of schools and colleges. This produced more top grades than has ever been seen before in A-levels - almost 28% getting A* and As - buthead teachers have been
angry about ""unfathomable"" individual injustices in the downgrading
of some results. You can get out of your car for a break in a remote area - but not in a service station or on a ferry If you have a holiday in a country which is exempt from UK
quarantine rules and donât make any stops in France on your drive back, you are not required to self-isolate on
your return to the UK. However, you must make sure no new people get into your
vehicle. The countries
which share a border with France and are currently exempt from quarantine rules
are Germany, Italy and Switzerland. All Franceâs
other neighbours - Spain, Andorra, Monaco, Luxembourg and Belgium
- are not exempt. So, if you have visited one of these countries during your
holiday, you will still have to self-isolate, even if you have made no stops
while driving through France. You can stop in a
remote place in France, for example to stretch your legs or walk your dog, and
if you donât have any contact with other people or enter any public spaces you
will not have to quarantine for 14 days when you get back. But if you get
out of your vehicle at a service station or on ferry while crossing from France
to the UK, you will be required to self-isolate on your return. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Israel and UAE strike historic peace dealIsrael and the United Arab Emirates agree to normalise relations in the third Israel-Arab peace deal.Middle East,"Benjamin Netanyahu and Prince Mohammed Al Nahyan brokered the agreement with US help Israel and the United Arab Emirates have reached a deal to normalise relations, with Israel agreeing to suspend its controversial plans to annex parts of the occupied West Bank. In a surprise statement by US President Donald Trump, who helped broker it, the countries called the accord ""historic"" and a breakthrough toward peace. Until now Israel has had no diplomatic relations with Gulf Arab countries. But shared worries over Iran have led to unofficial contacts between them. Palestinian leaders were reportedly taken by surprise. A spokesman for President Mahmoud Abbas said the deal amounted to ""treason"", and the Palestinian ambassador to the UAE was being recalled. President Trump called the deal between Prime Minister Netanyahu and Abu Dhabi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Zayed Al Nahyan ""a truly historic moment"". It marks only the third Israel-Arab peace deal since Israel's declaration of independence in 1948, after Egypt and Jordan. ""Now that the ice has been broken I expect more Arab and Muslim countries will follow the United Arab Emirates,"" he told reporters in the Oval Office, saying there would be a signing ceremony at the White House in the coming weeks. Earlier, in response to a President Trump's tweeted announcement, Mr Netanyahu wrote in Hebrew: ""Historic day."" In a TV address Mr Netanyahu said he had ""delayed"" West Bank annexation plans, but those plans remain ""on the table"". Annexation would make some West Bank areas officially part of Israel. ""There is no change in my plan to apply our sovereignty to Judea and Samaria [West Bank] in full co-ordination with the US. I'm committed to it. That hasn't changed. I remind you that I was the one who put the issue of sovereignty over Judea and Samaria on the table. This issue remains on the table,"" he said. Mr Netanyahu said Israel would co-operate with the UAE in developing a coronavirus vaccine, in energy, water, environmental protection and many other fields. Analysts say the deal could mean a foreign policy victory for President Trump, who will seek re-election in November, and give a personal boost to Prime Minister Netanyahu, who is on trial for alleged corruption. Both leaders have seen their approval ratings drop because of their response to the coronavirus pandemic. And in Israel, some on the right who want to annex the West Bank expressed anger over the announcement. This video can not be played Israel annexation: What is the West Bank? The UAE's ambassador to the US, Yousef Al Otaiba, said the deal with Israel was""a win for diplomacy and for the region"",external, adding: ""It is a significant advance in Arab-Israeli relations that lowers tensions and creates new energy for positive change"". Senior Trump adviser Jared Kushner said he did not think Israel would move ahead with any annexation before discussing it first with the US. He said he expected to see interactions ""very quickly"" between Israel and the UAE. Egypt signed a deal with Israel in 1979, and Jordan in 1994. Mauritania also established diplomatic ties with Israel in 1999, but froze the deal in 2009. The establishment of full diplomatic relations; the exchange of embassies; and normal trade ties between Israel and the UAE is a significant diplomatic step forward. But inevitably it raises questions. Will the full promise of this agreement be realised? And might other Gulf countries follow a similar path? It is also important to see what it is not. This is far from the comprehensive peace plan to resolve the Palestinian question that President Trump has long promoted. However, there are short-term benefits for all sides. The White House was first off the mark in announcing the deal; it is perhaps a small diplomatic feather in President Trump's cap at a time when his re-election prospects are looking more difficult. For Israel's embattled Prime Minister Netanyahu, it gets him off a hook of his own making; his much-vaunted promise to annex key parts of the occupied West Bank. This has proved undeliverable, not least due to US ambivalence and significant international opposition. Mr Netanyahu may see this ""peace initiative"" with the UAE as something that could bolster his chances if he precipitates a further Israeli general election. For the UAE, it is harder to say precisely what the immediate benefits are, though its relations with Washington will be strengthened and the deal with Israel may yield significant economic, security and scientific benefits. Overall this is an agreement that potentially could offer both more and less than might first appear. And as far as the Palestinians are concerned, it is hard to see this news creating anything other than frustration, that they have once again been pushed to the sidelines. In the coming weeks delegations from Israel and the UAE will meet to sign bilateral deals,externalregarding investment, tourism, direct flights, security, telecommunications, technology, energy, healthcare, culture, the environment, the establishment of reciprocal embassies, and other areas of mutual benefit. ""Opening direct ties between two of the Middle East's most dynamic societies and advanced economies will transform the region by spurring economic growth, enhancing technological innovation, and forging closer people-to-people relations,"" the joint statement says. Israel will also ""suspend declaring sovereignty over areas outlined"" in President Trump's Vision for Peace between Israel and the Palestinians, in which he backed an Israeli plan to annex Jewish settlements in the West Bank and the strategic Jordan Valley. What does Trumpâs Mid-East plan say on key issues? Explainer: Israel, annexation and the West Bank The Palestinians have warned that such a move would destroy their hopes of a viable future independent state and violate international law - a stance supported by much of the international community. The UAE Minister of State for Foreign Affairs, Anwar Gargash, said the UAE's recognition of Israel was ""a very bold step"" to stop the ""ticking time bomb"" of Israel's annexation of the West Bank. He said the UAE saw this as ""a stoppage of the annexation, not a suspension"". Asked about Palestinian criticism of the UAE move, he recognised that the region was very polarised and he expected to hear ""the usual noise"".  ""We agonised over this,"" he said, but eventually decided ""let's do it"". The joint statement says Israel will ""focus its efforts now on expanding ties with other countries in the Arab and Muslim world"", and that the US and UAE will work to achieve that goal. The UAE and Israel will also join the US to launch a ""Strategic Agenda for the Middle East"", with the three leaders noting that they ""share a similar outlook regarding the threats and opportunities in the region, as well as a shared commitment to promoting stability through diplomatic engagement, increased economic integration, and closer security co-ordination"". UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said ""it was my profound hope that annexation did not go ahead in the West Bank and today's agreement to suspend those plans is a welcome step on the road to a more peaceful Middle East"". Egyptian President Abdul Fattah al-Sisi welcomed the deal while Jordan's Foreign Minister Ayman Safadi said the agreement could help push ahead stalled peace negotiations. But a senior Palestinian official, Hanan Ashrawi, condemned the deal, saying the UAE had ""come out in the open on its secret dealings/normalisation with Israel"" and telling Prince Mohammed: ""May you never be sold out by your 'friends'."" Iran's foreign ministry called the accord ""shameful"", according to state news agency IRNA. And in Gaza, the Hamas militant group called the deal a ""stabbing in the back of our people.""

Labour backbench revolt against A-level downgrading,"Education Minister Kirsty Williams met students at Merthyr College on results day The Welsh Government's handling of exam results is to be ""urgently"" examined by a Senedd committee amid criticism over the grading of A-levels. Students have accused the Welsh Government of ""abandoning them"" after 42% of grades were lowered by the exams watchdog. As head teachers described the results as ""unjust"", the Senedd's education committee has been recalled. But First Minister Mark Drakeford has said it was ""a record year"" for pupils. ""The big picture is we have more students achieving, more students achieving at the very top end of the scale, and a record number of people from Wales accepted into university,"" he told BBC Wales. The handling of the results system has seen the Labour government come under fire from head teachers and some of its own backbenchers, who said some pupils had got results two grades lower than predicted. This video can not be played Bradley Desmier was predicted a B, C and a merit but got a D, E and a pass The Welsh Parliament is on its summer break, but the Children, Young People and Education Committee will now meet on Tuesday. Chair Lynne Neagle said decision-makers must explain what happened to provide ""clarity"", ahead of the publication of GCSE results next week. ""Young people's well-being, and their ability to plan for their future learning and careers, will be at the centre of our work looking at these issues,"" she said. ""We recognise that these matters are complex and will need detailed, longer term consideration. However, we believe that there is an important role for us to play now, to ask questions which will ensure that a fair and clear approach is adopted and communicated to the Welsh people as quickly as possible."" Exams were cancelled after schools were closed in March Mike Hedges, Labour member of the Senedd for Swansea East, had said he knew of pupils receiving a lower than predicted grade ""without any samples of their work being checked"". But Mr Drakeford told BBC Radio Wales Breakfast: ""I read what people said, and I don't agree that it was strong criticism."" Labour MS for Aberavon David Rees has backed calls for a ""full review"" to examine whether poorer areas have been more affected by the grading system than more affluent areas. ""The robust and fair quotes that the government is talking about is of course consistency across Wales, but I do not believe that that has actually been fair to individuals,"" he told BBC Radio Wales. ""These are young people whose futures are on the line."" Unfair results claim after grades lowered Minister makes pledge on this year's grades Exams were cancelled this summer due to the coronavirus pandemic, with results based on teacher estimates. But 42% were downgraded by exams watchdog,Qualifications Wales, after it judged the grades were ""too generous"". On Wednesday, Education Minister Kirsty Williams promised that students would be guaranteed a grade no lower than they achieved at AS-level. But with the last-minute intervention coming after results had already been sent to schools and colleges, there are concerns that universities may judge applications on the grades already issued, before that revision takes effect. In an open letter to Ms Williams, 16 members of the Welsh Youth Parliament also called for action. Welsh Youth Parliament member Jonathan Powell says students feel ""abandoned"" A-level student and Wrexham youth parliament member Jonathan Powell said: ""Not only have you abandoned thousands of students who did not have a chance to sit their exams, but you have demonstrated a lack of respect and trust in teachers across the nation."" He said he had been predicted to achieve A* and A grades, but was awarded a single A grade and Bs. ""How is it justifiable that A*s are brought down to Bs?"" he asked. Abbie Cooper, 17, from Cwmbran is another member of the youth parliament who signed the letter. She said her predicted AS-level grades were downgraded from three Bs to an unclassified and two D grades. ""It kind of feels like they just got a number generator or a letter generator and given you a grade based on that,"" she said. ""It sucks because I need these to apply for university next year because these are my predicted for university. How can I go anywhere with these?"" She said it had left her felling ""distraught"" and she would now be appealing the results. Natalie Johns said her future was decided by people who did not know her work or what she could and had achieved When Natalie Johns opened her A-level results on Thursday, the results were not what she was predicted. The 18-year-old's teachers had calculated she would get all A*s, meaning she would meet the requirements of her conditional offer to study psychology at Cambridge University. But when she opened her results at Y Pant School, in Rhondda Cynon Taff, her results had been lowered to one A* in biology, with As in maths and psychology. The teenager had a desperate 24 hours after her chosen college said they could not accept her, and she was put in a ""summer pool"" waiting to see if another college would let her in. But she has since had the good news she has been accepted after her school and MP got involved, but said she would still be fighting to get the grade changed. ""It is not important right now, but these A-level results are going to stick with me for life - if I am going for a job, it's not going to have a sticker next to it saying the grade is because of Covid-19,"" she said. ""It was such a let down, that this is how we were treated and how our [school] education came to an end."" Natalie said she was angry with the Welsh Government for their response to students' concerns. ""They are almost bragging about how you can't go lower than your AS grade, but you can't get an A* at AS-level,"" said Natalie. ""For high achievers wanting to go on to study medicine and other subjects, it really matters. It's the injustice of it."" Some pupils were pleased with their results Head teachers in north Wales said the way results were allocated was ""unfair"" and ""impossible to fathom"", saying their own teachers' estimates had been done with ""professionalism and fairness"". The Federation of North Wales Secondary School Head Teachers said many universities had lowered their offers due to a shortage of international students during the pandemic. But while that meant many students would be able to attend their university of choice, the A-level grades would be ""with them for the rest of their lives"". Claire Armitstead, head teacher of Rhyl High School, said the system had generated ""numerous inconsistencies"". ""It can never be forgotten that every inconsistency is a child whose life has been turned upside by an algorithm and this cannot be allowed to happen,"" she said. ""It is unjust and immoral and our children deserve better."" Geraint Parry, head teacher at Ysgol Brynhyfryd, in Ruthin, Denbighshire, said: ""Students have been disregarded, downgraded and simply told 'computer says no'."" Ellen Williams, head of Llanrug's Ysgol Brynrefail, Gwynedd, said the grading system had ""resulted in many of our young people's lives being devastated"". Plaid Cymru's leader also urged Mr Drakeford to ensure pupils in Wales awarded lower grades received their predicted results instead. In a letter to the first minister, Adam Price said this should also apply to next week's GCSE results ""and this should be communicated to learners today, for peace of mind"". Mr Price pointed to comments from the UK Labour leader Keir Starmer, who has said ministers in Englandmust follow the lead of Scotland and allow teacher assessed marks to be accepted. But Wales' first minister said Mr Starmer was referring to the position in: ""England, where they don't have AS-levels; England where you have to pay for an appeal; England where people will be kept waiting for longer for results than they have here in Wales. ""Our position is very different."" A pupil from Swansea checking her results on Thursday A Welsh Government spokesman said about 94% of the grades were the same or within one grade of those students were predicted to achieve. ""This is before any adjustments are made as a result of the AS [level] floor announced yesterday by the minister for education,"" he added. ""We have also asked Qualifications Wales to consider whether the grounds for appeal can be broadened for all A-level, AS-level and GCSE qualifications and we expect to provide more information on this next week. ""No student from Wales should be disadvantaged against other UK students. ""We are pleased that, following the publication of the results today, UCAS have reported the highest number of Welsh learners being offered a place at university since 2011.""

France to be added to UK quarantine countriesPeople returning from the Netherlands and Malta from Saturday will also have to self-isolate.UK Politics,"This video can not be played Transport Secretary Grant Shapps explains decision behind France quarantine rules Thousands of holidaymakers have seen their plans thrown into chaos after UK quarantine measures were imposed on France from Saturday. The 14-day isolation requirement from 04:00 BST also now applies to people arriving from the Netherlands, Monaco, Malta, Turks and Caicos, and Aruba. It comes after France's prime minister acknowledged infection numbers were going ""the wrong way"". France warned it would take ""reciprocal measures"". Clement Beaune, France's secretary of state for European affairs,tweeted that the UK's decision was a matter of ""regret"" for the French,external. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said the decision was triggered when the rate of infection in the affected countries exceeded 20 cases per 100,000 people over seven days. The quarantine requirement was previously applied to Spain, another popular destination for UK holidaymakers, at the end of July. ""We've worked so hard in this country to get our level of infections down, the last thing we want do is to have people returning and bringing the infection with them. It's to protect everybody,"" Mr Shapps told BBC Breakfast. There are about 160,000 British holidaymakers currently in France, he said. The deadline is expected to induce a rush to ports and airports, with thousands of tourists desperate to avoid quarantine. I'm in France right now - what do I do? Lockdown to ease further in England from Saturday European countries fight coronavirus surge Where are the world's coronavirus hotspots? Others who cannot return in time face disruption to work or schooling. Katie, a teacher on holiday in the south of France, told the BBC that the 12-hour drive to the Channel crossing means she has no chance to return in time, so she and her children will miss the start of term. ""We have done everything the government has asked of us for months but I really think they need to treat us all with a little respect and give us time to organise ourselves so that we can continue with our jobs, and our children with their lives,"" she said. Eurotunnel said its Channel Tunnel trains were fully booked until Saturday. Earlier, customers had faced long queues to access the website. Mariana Fabricante, who is trying to return from the mountain resort of Tignes with her family, said: ""Every time I try to change the ticket, the website is busy. People would be able to make informed decisions if they had been told in advance. It's annoying and frustrating."" John Keefe, director of public affairs at Getlink, which operates the Channel Tunnel,warned people not to travel to the terminal without a confirmed booking. ""There is no space available,"" he said. Eurostar passengers arriving at St Pancras, having beaten the quarantine deadline Prices of some flights to the UK from Paris were more than Â£450, compared to Â£66 on Saturday. Many direct flights from the south of France are sold out. The cheapest Eurostar tickets were Â£210, compared with Â£165 on Saturday. But DFDS Ferries said it had added an extra four departures from Calais to help Britons return in time. It said bookings must be made before arriving at port. Some holidaymakers said they would accept the quarantine restrictions on their return instead. Jonathan Fieldsend from Woodbridge in Suffolk, who is not due to return from France with his family until 18 August, said: ""We came fully accepting the risk we were taking of quarantine being introduced. We are not going to be rushing back."" Airlines UK described the quarantine restrictions as ""another devastating blow to the travel industry already reeling from the worst crisis in its history"". The UK's ambassador to France, Lord Llewellyn,acknowledged that the new quarantine rule would be ""unwelcome news"" for Britons in the country,external, but stressed that people could continue with their holidays as long as they follow safety precautions and self-isolate on their return. Shadow home secretary Nick Thomas-Symonds said while the Labour party supports ""evidence based measures"" at the border, it was ""vital"" that No 10 had a ""joined-up strategy"" and ""urgently"" puts in place a specific deal to support the heavily impacted travel sector. The MP added: ""That the government has still not put in place an effective track, trace and isolate system has made matters far worse and made it more likely that we are reliant on the blunt tool of 14-day quarantine."" He called on Downing Street to publish science behind its decisions, ""and details of any work being done to reduce the time needed to isolate through increased testing and other measures"".

The Foreign Office is now warning against ""all but essential travel"" to France - the quarantine measure was imposed for Spain on 25 July. A list of more than 50 so-called travel corridors - allowing movement between the UK and the other countries without the need to self-isolate on return - waspublished at the start of last monthand later expanded. But the ending of some of the exemptions on the list follows a ""significant change"" in the risk of contracting Covid-19, the Department for Transport said. It added that there had been a 66% increaseâ¯in newly reported cases per 100,000 people in France since last Friday. For the Netherlands, it was up 52%. And the increase for Malta was 105%, while it was 273% for Turks and Caicos and 1,106% for Aruba. Ahead of a government meeting on the new measures, UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised to be ""absolutely ruthless"" in deciding on rules for holidaymakers from abroad. ""We can't be remotely complacent about our own situation. Everybody understands that in a pandemic you don't allow our population to be re-infected or the disease to come back in,"" he added.

"Call for migrants' free school meals extensionPupils from low-income migrant families should keep getting government support, say charities.UK","Free school meals should be permanently extended to the children of migrants in England who are currently ineligible for public support, charities say. During the coronavirus outbreak the meal scheme has temporarily included some pupils whosefamilies have ""no recourse to public funds"" (NRPF).,external Sixty organisations have written to the education secretary asking him to permanently extend the scheme. The government said it would continue while Covid-19 ""impacts schools"". NRPF status is given to some migrants as a condition of their right to remain in the UK - generally those who have not yet qualified for permanent residency - and prevents them from receiving most government-funded benefits. Who gets free school meals? The government has already made a U-turn on providing free school meals outside of term-time. That came afteran intervention in June by Manchester United footballer Marcus Rashford,who campaigned for the government to offer free school meal vouchers over the summer holidays in England. Now charities and trade unions have demanded ministers change their policy again, ensuring children from low-income migrant families with no recourse to public funds are added to the list of those eligible for free meals when schools reopen. In a letter to Education Secretary Gavin Williamson,,externalthe 60 organisations, which includes the Children's Society, Unison, and Action for Children, said they ""applauded"" the decision to extend free school meals to some NRPF families in April. However, they said they were ""extremely concerned by the government's intention to stop providing free school meals to these children in the near future"". ""The progress the government has made by extending this vital lifeline to NRPF families will be lost unless you make this change permanent,"" the letter says. ""We ask that you urgently provide clarity to these families ahead of the return to school in September by confirming that they will continue to be eligible for free school meals - fully and permanently."" Analysis by Oxford University's Migration Observatory, published on Friday, suggests more than 175,000 children in the UK are from NRPF families. Sam Royston, director of policy and research for the Children's Society, said that those figures showed the number of children affected was rising, adding that ""whether a child is able to eat should not depend on their parents' immigration status"". A Department for Education spokeswoman said: ""We have temporarily extended free school meal eligibility to include some children of groups who have no recourse to public funds in light of the current unique circumstances many families face at this time. ""This will continue for the duration of the summer holidays and while the outbreak impacts schools."" This video can not be played Marcus Rashford: ""I'm grateful the prime minister changed his decision"" Meanwhile, a law firm has also prepared a possible legal challenge, arguing that excluding poor children from free school meals because of immigration status is discriminatory and a breach of human rights. Matthew Gold & Co Ltd. Solicitors has been instructed to challenge the eligibility criteria for free school meals. In England, about 1.3 million children claimed for free school meals in 2019 - about 15% of state-educated pupils. Children of all ages living in households on income-related benefits may be eligible, from government-maintained nurseries through to sixth forms. Eligibility varies slightly between England, Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland because the nations set their own rules. During the coronavirus lockdown the government provided vouchers to families in England whose children qualified for free meals, which it then extended over the summer holidays. Children eligible could receive a Â£90 food voucher to cover the six-week summer holiday, or Â£105 if their school had a seven-week break. Will my child get free school meals this summer holiday?

They put nine of us on trial - we made history," Echoes of black lives matter from 50 years ago By Ashley John-Baptiste By Ashley John-Baptiste  It was a summer Sunday afternoon and most locals were home. Curtains twitched and front doors opened. Some residents ventured bravely outside to witness the scene. Their quiet backstreet in west London had become a battleground. At a noisy but otherwise peaceful march to protest at “police harassment” of black people, fighting between protesters and police had broken out. Nine people would end up at the Old Bailey in a high-profile, but now much-forgotten, trial that secured an important spot in the timeline of black British people. This article has imagery of a pig’s head which some readers may find upsetting. In March 1968 a new all-night restaurant - the Mangrove - opened on All Saints Road in Notting Hill. Run by Trinidadian-born entrepreneur, Frank Crichlow, it was dimly lit with black leather furniture. Woman outside the Mangrove restaurant  “I remember when it started. Frank wanted it to be an upmarket restaurant. They played soul music and the waiters and waitresses dressed in white suits and straw hats,” says one of Frank’s friends, 79-year-old Clive Phillip - or “Mashup” as locals call him. Notting Hill in the late 1960s was not the sought after address it is today. There were still undeveloped bomb sites from World War Two, many of the impressive white-rendered Victorian mansions had seen better days and an elevated concrete artery - the Westway motorway - was under construction, carving the area in two. But because accommodation was cheap, many Windrush migrants - people arriving in the UK between 1948 and 1971 from Caribbean countries - called the area home.

But because accommodation was cheap, many Windrush migrants - people arriving in the UK between 1948 and 1971 from Caribbean countries - called the area home.         “The Mangrove was the ‘go to’ place for black people in the area,” says Barbara Beese, one of the Mangrove Nine. She vividly remembers the spicy aroma of West Indian food wafting through the restaurant and the mural of mangrove trees on the wall. “Frank used to make the most wicked pineapple punch. My son was weaned on that juice,” she says. Barbara Beese The Mangrove served the best Caribbean food in the area, says Clive - who loved the spring chicken with rice and peas, followed by banana fritters. Maybe that was why it attracted an impressive array of A-listers. “Bob Marley would play football around the corner, or be at the music studio, and then pop over to the Mangrove for food,” says Clive. Jimi Hendrix, Diana Ross and Marvin Gaye - plus actress Vanessa Redgrave - all sampled the cuisine. But the Mangrove was, say Clive and Barbara, more than just a restaurant. It became a home from home for the Caribbean community - and a space for political discussion. When Clive arrived in “dismal and cold” London from Trinidad, he struggled. Low on money, unable to find work at the start, and fearful of white racist “Teddy Boy” thugs - he longed for community. Then the Mangrove opened and he felt at home. Clive Phillip “It was like a sanctuary. It was family, a base of support.” Barbara agrees. “There was good food, but there was way more to it. All Saints Road and the Mangrove were popularly known as ‘the frontline’. “People associate that term with drug dealing, but what I mean is that the Mangrove was the frontline of support for the black community. “They’d get advice on things like housing. Frank’s restaurant became the crucible for all of that.” But in December 1969, two days before Christmas, the restaurant was dealt a blow. The local council - Kensington and Chelsea - suddenly withdrew Frank’s licence to operate as an all-night cafe. The Mangrove had been open from 18:00 to 06:00 - with the bulk of trade after midnight. Frank was told he could now only offer takeaway food after 23:00. He complained, claiming to be the victim of unlawful discrimination. “The Mangrove was the ‘go to’ place for black people in the area,” says Barbara Beese, one of the Mangrove Nine.

Frank was told he could now only offer takeaway food after 23:00. He complained, claiming to be the victim of unlawful discrimination. One of the reasons given to Frank for his licence removal was that “people with criminal records, prostitutes, and convicted persons” used the Mangrove. “My restaurant is patronised by respectable people,” wrote Frank on the Race Relations Board complaint form. He also said his premises had been “unlawfully raided” by police on two occasions. With his new restricted licence, Frank felt he was under close scrutiny. Frank Crichlow in 1970 “Since the decision of the council, police cars have been outside the restaurant almost every night, I assume to check I am complying with the regulations,” he wrote in another letter in early 1970. “Not once did they ever find evidence of ‘drugs, pimps and prostitutes’ as one policeman said of us who inhabited the Mangrove,” recalls Barbara. She says the police appeared to resent the restaurant’s popularity - especially with its high profile customers. “To the police, Frank was a Trinidadian businessman gaining too much influence.” Clive says the police would turn up looking for drugs. “Everyone knew Frank was anti-drugs - you most certainly couldn’t go there if you had a reputation for being dodgy or selling weed. “It was harassment. It dragged the restaurant’s reputation down. They saw us black people as a threat.” In the following months, the police raids persisted. They were “harassing the black community with impunity”, says Barbara. Frank looked for support from the local Caribbean community and the newly-formed British Black Panthers anti-racist group - which was inspired by the radical political organisation, the Black Panther Party in the US. A group called “The Action Committee for the Defence of the Mangrove” was created and preparations for a protest march began. The Mangrove restaurant “We simply wanted to make visible our opposition to what was happening at the Mangrove,” says Barbara. The building quickly became a makeshift hub for community activism. “You had the restaurant upstairs, but downstairs people were busy preparing placards for the march,” says Clive. Before the protest, the Mangrove committee wrote an open letter to Prime Minister Edward Heath and others. It said the many “deliberate raids, harassments and provocations” by the police had been reported to the Home Office on many occasions but had fallen on deaf ears. “This protest is necessary as all other methods have failed to bring about any change in the manner the police have chosen to deal with black people.” One of the reasons given to Frank for his licence removal was that “people with criminal records, prostitutes, and convicted persons” used the Mangrove. “My restaurant is patronised by respectable people,” wrote Frank on the Race Relations Board complaint form.

It was mostly made up of Caribbeans, says Clive - people from Notting Hill, Brixton, Islington and all over London. About 14:45, according to police notes, there were 100 people there. Photos show demonstrators holding banners painted with phrases like “this is the time”, “black unity now” and “hands off us pigs”. The protesters had at least one pigs head - a derogatory nod at the police - which would be held aloft once they started marching. The crowd was growing impatient and Clive remembers activist Darcus Howe stood on the roof of a car to address everybody. “We’ve complained to the police about the police and nothing’s been done,” he said. “We’ve complained to magistrates about magistrates and nothing’s been done. We’ve complained to judges about judges and nothing’s been done. Now it’s time to do something ourselves.” Remembering her late father, Darcus’s daughter Tamara describes him as being “ferociously committed to fighting injustices”. “He was always very honest with me about the realities of racism. He was uncompromising on tolerating anything that was remotely racially unjust.”  Tamara Howe As Darcus spoke, says Clive, about a dozen police officers appeared from around the corner. Darcus pointed at them, and the crowd started shouting “pigs”. “Enough was enough - we had to stick up for the Mangrove,” says Clive. The protest had started.

The marchers, numbering as many as 150 by now, intended to walk past several police stations in the area. They were vastly outnumbered by police. A police document obtained by historian Paul Field - who co-wrote a biography of Darcus Howe - revealed that 588 constables, 84 sergeants, 29 inspectors and four chief inspectors had been made available to cover the protest. There was also a handful of plain clothes and Special Branch detectives. Barbara Beese holding a pig’s head The number of police officers is something Barbara saw as “ridiculous” - given the march was intended to be “jolly and good spirited”. Police logs give a minute-by-minute account of the march’s progress. Officers appear to have been unsure of where the protestors were planning to go. At one stage, an officer spotted a two-tone Volkswagen van in a nearby street and believed it to be “loaded with eggs” which may be “used by demonstrators”.

The Mangrove march snaked its way west and then north - underneath the now newly open Westway motorway, across the Grand Union Canal and into residential streets north of the main Harrow Road. “Things turned nasty as we walked down Portnall Road,” says Clive. Police notes say the procession stopped at about 16.40 and within two minutes there was serious fighting in Portnall Road and neighbouring streets. Officers were calling for assistance and ambulances. How the fighting started is unclear. “Some placards had pig heads on them,” says Clive. “That’s how we saw the police given how they treated us black people.” “I saw a police officer pull down a placard, while a few officers pinned the guy on the ground. “I could smell trouble.” Other witnesses gave different accounts. Police notes say a number of marchers “threw bricks from a builder’s skip and disorder ensued”. One witness, an elderly woman watching from her window, said that the riot started when a bottle was thrown at a policeman: “The police did not interfere until this occurred.” A retired postman described a misunderstanding on both sides. Police stopped the procession to let a car cross its path - he said - at which point “as quick as a flash” the march leaders “seemed to lose control”.

At 16:56, police reported that about 50 protestors had started to make their way back to the Mangrove restaurant - but scuffles continued in the streets around Portnall Road for another 20 minutes or so. By the end, 24 police officers had been injured and 19 arrests had been made. Nine individuals - including Barbara Beese, Darcus Howe and Frank Crichlow - were charged with incitement to riot and affray. But these initial riot charges were ​dismissed by the presiding magistrate through lack of evidence - says Paul Field - and because “police statements were thought to be contradictory”. One senior officer stated the “melee was spontaneous” and others claimed it was incited by the defendants in order to start a riot​. In total, 23 pages of police statements were ruled to be inadmissible by the magistrate. According to a Sunday Times report from early 1971, a central point to the prosecution’s case was that protesters had allegedly shouted and had banners stating: “Kill the pigs” - a Black Power anti-police slogan imported from America. The words were evidence of violence said prosecutors, but the magistrate disagreed. Despite this, the director of public prosecutions ended up reinstating the charges. Special Branch and Home Office documents indicate, says Paul Field, the move was a “deliberate strategy to target and discredit black power leaders”. The defendants were rearrested. The Mangrove Nine, as they were becoming known, got ready to defend themselves at the Old Bailey. A new BBC drama tells the story of the Mangrove Nine - one of five original films from Bafta and Oscar-winning director Steve McQueen. Each film in McQueen’s Small Axe anthology tells a different story from London’s West Indian community, where lives have been shaped - despite racism and discrimination - by personal determination. Watch Mangrove on BBC iPlayer now. Barbara Beese still remembers the atmosphere of the courtroom. “It was male, pale and stale,” she says. She was about 20 at the time and felt the room was physically very intimidating - with the judge positioned up high. “The Old Bailey was where the worst criminals went on trial, so for us to be there, it was like being told we were up there with murderers and rapists.” The strategic way the nine organised their defence is one of the reasons why the trial is considered so significant. “We took the trial issues head on,” recalls Barbara. “There was very little time to think about the emotional toll of it all. We’d spend all day in the Old Bailey and then meet for hours afterwards to debrief.” Barbara Beese, Frank Crichlow and Darcus Howe were joined in the dock by Rupert Boyce, Rhodan Gordon, Anthony Innis, Altheia Jones-LeCointe, Rothwell Kentish and Godfrey Millett. Darcus and Altheia took the bold decision to defend themselves. Darcus Howe in 2000 It meant they could speak directly to the jury, rather than going through the intermediary of a barrister. The prospect of black people defending themselves in court increased media attention. The next radical step was the demand, by Darcus, for an all-black jury - or a “jury of peers” - explains Paul Field. The judge was asked to consider an ancient precedent enshrined in the Magna Carta of 1215, which established the principle of the right to justice and a fair trial for all. “We never saw this as a fair trial and so we hoped an all-black jury would level the playing field,” says Barbara. She recalls how Altheia, Darcus and the defence barrister Ian MacDonald made legal arguments for two days. “Obviously the judge wasn’t going to have any of that,” she says. But even then, the defendants used their right to question and dismiss potential jurors. Among other things they were asked what they understood by the term “black power”. Sixty-three were rejected. The final selection included two black people. Flyer in support of the defendants In the coming weeks - the Kensington Post newspaper reported at the end of the trial - more than 50 witnesses would be called by the prosecution, and almost twice as many would be called by the defence. Barbara’s greatest concern was for her - and Darcus’s - baby son. “Part of the terror was thinking about what would’ve happened to him if we lost the case. I knew the response would have been vindictive in terms of punishment. And, as a black woman brought up in the care system, that’s the last thing I wanted to happen to my son.” A young teacher, Farrukh Dhondy - a new recruit to the Black Panther movement - was asked to take notes in court. “A lot of black people came to listen,” he says. “The word about Darcus’s oratory had spread.” “I would rush off to the Old Bailey after work. I would sit in the gallery every day for an hour or so and take notes.” Farrukh Dhondy Darcus and Farrukh were strangers at the time. In the years after, they became close friends. “Darcus was very theatrical and showed off like hell,” says Farrukh. Remembering Altheia, he says: “Whenever she spoke, you could hear a pin drop.” The trial ended on Thursday 16 December 1971. It wasn’t so much the result, as the closing remarks of the judge, that placed the Mangrove Nine in the history books. All the defendants were acquitted of the main charges of incitement to riot. Five were acquitted of all charges against them. The remaining four - Rupert Boyce, Rhodan Gordon, Anthony Innis and Altheia Jones-Lecointe - received suspended sentences for a selection of lesser offences, including affray and assaulting police officers. But it was Judge Edward Clarke’s closing comments that left a lasting mark. “What this trial has shown is that there is clearly evidence of racial hatred on both sides,” he told the courtroom. Perhaps it wasn’t so unusual, given the year, for the judge to suggest racism on the part of the defendants. The authorities and press had been accusing the Black Power movement of “anti-white racism” ever since US activist Stokely Carmichael’s visit to the UK in 1967. But more importantly, it was the first judicial acknowledgment of racism in the Metropolitan Police. “It was a big moment. Members of the jury even celebrated with us outside the Old Bailey,” says Barbara. For Farrukh, the ruling “sent a clear message to the British establishment to not go overboard with charging demonstrators.” The Met Police were not happy. “All the police officers who gave evidence were at great pains to explain they felt no personal antagonism towards black people within our community,” wrote one senior detective. “However, when directly questioned, one or two officers stated that they reserved personal views against certain individuals,” he continued. Senior officers sought, but failed, to get the judge to retract his comments. Barbara Beese still remembers the atmosphere of the courtroom. “It was male, pale and stale,” she says. She was about 20 at the time and felt the room was physically very intimidating - with the judge positioned up high. “The Old Bailey was where the worst criminals went on trial, so for us to be there, it was like being told we were up there with murderers and rapists.” The strategic way the nine organised their defence is one of the reasons why the trial is considered so significant. “We took the trial issues head on,” recalls Barbara. “There was very little time to think about the emotional toll of it all. We’d spend all day in the Old Bailey and then meet for hours afterwards to debrief.” Barbara Beese, Frank Crichlow and Darcus Howe were joined in the dock by Rupert Boyce, Rhodan Gordon, Anthony Innis, Altheia Jones-LeCointe, Rothwell Kentish and Godfrey Millett. Darcus and Altheia took the bold decision to defend themselves. Darcus Howe in 2000 It meant they could speak directly to the jury, rather than going through the intermediary of a barrister. The prospect of black people defending themselves in court increased media attention. The next radical step was the demand, by Darcus, for an all-black jury - or a “jury of peers” - explains Paul Field. The judge was asked to consider an ancient precedent enshrined in the Magna Carta of 1215, which established the principle of the right to justice and a fair trial for all. “We never saw this as a fair trial and so we hoped an all-black jury would level the playing field,” says Barbara.

As a result of his re-arrest in October 1970 - in relation to the Portnall Road violence - he was charged with the attempted murder of a police officer. He was eventually sentenced to 36 months for assault and possession of an offensive weapon. Rothwell “Roddy” Kentish died in 2019 aged 87. Joe Kentish with his father Rothwell  “The experience made my dad bitter,” says his 44-year-old son, Joseph. “In his last years, he had dementia and on his deathbed, all he spoke about was the [second] trial. “He kept asking us to find his court papers. I still feel a massive sense of injustice for him.” At Roddy’s funeral, a letter was read from the Mangrove Nine barrister, Ian MacDonald, acknowledging that he had borne perhaps the heaviest personal cost of the trial. Joseph says there’s even a doubt over whether his father was ever at the Mangrove march - with a suggestion he was fixing a car elsewhere. Joseph Kentish  “As a community leader, police obviously assumed that Dad would’ve had a hand in the march. “One thing I know is that the period our parents went through was deeply traumatic. They were brilliant and complex people who were deeply affected by those struggles.”  After the trial, one of the nine - Rothwell Kentish, faced a separate prosecution.

They were brilliant and complex people who were deeply affected by those struggles.”  The message to take from the Mangrove trial is, according to historian Paul Field, that racial discrimination cannot only be “defeated in protests on the streets, but also by black people organising their own defence in the courtroom”. The Mangrove Nine achieved an incredible feat, he says. They convinced a white-majority jury that the police had “stains of racism” and that the officers’ “trumped up allegations were without foundation”. But the struggle for racial equality is far from over, says Barbara. “We thought we were gonna change the world back then. But still, when you look at the disproportionate number of black men in custody and the general climate we find ourselves in, we have to keep on fighting.” In a statement, a Metropolitan Police spokesperson said: “All of society - of which policing is of course a part - has a role to play in reducing disproportionate outcomes in cases where disproportionality is found to be based on ethnicity alone. We continue to work with Londoners to find a way to police London that saves lives while retaining the confidence of our communities.” Barbara says black people may be better at defending themselves and calling to account actions of error, but “there are still issues of institutional racism within the police”. That thought is echoed by Leroy Logan, a black former police superintendent - who worked in the Met for 30 years. He gave evidence to the inquiry into the 1993 murder of black teenager, Stephen Lawrence - which labelled the force as “institutionally racist”. Leroy Logan “We did see improvements for a bit [after the 1999 Lawrence Inquiry], but there are still officers in the force who, for some reason, feel emboldened to have prejudices against black people.” But for Joseph Kentish - Rothwell’s son - there has been some progress over the years. “If you’re arrested in London, I do think that as a black man you’re still in serious danger of being hurt and stereotyped - but I don’t think you need to have the same level of fear as my dad.” The Met says it has come a long way since 1999, and is more scrutinised and accountable than it has ever been, but “appreciates some concerns remain”. “We do not believe our officers are prejudiced or ignorant - or carry out racist stereotyping,” said a spokesperson. “But that is not to say there are no areas for improvement. Of course there are, as there are in all organisations and institutions today.” The message to take from the Mangrove trial is, according to historian Paul Field, that racial discrimination cannot only be “defeated in protests on the streets, but also by black people organising their own defence in the courtroom”.

The building where the restaurant was is now private housing. But Barbara says its legacy as a “space for black resistance” lives on. “People still talk about the Mangrove trial,” says Leroy Logan. “It gave birth to a spirit of activism in the black community.” Site of the Mangrove restaurant Darcus Howe’s daughter, Tamara, agrees. She says it produced hope and “tangible guidance on how to self-organise, mobilise and campaign”. Her father, a writer and broadcaster who campaigned for black rights for more than 50 years, died in 2017. And what of the recent Black Lives Matter protests - following the death of George Floyd in the US? Are they channelling the spirit of the Mangrove? “It has been inspiring seeing people come out, telling it like it is,” says Tamara. “I’ve never seen anything like it before. And to be joined by white people? I feel really positive.” And from one who has spent a lifetime championing black lives - Barbara says she’s now filled with optimism.
