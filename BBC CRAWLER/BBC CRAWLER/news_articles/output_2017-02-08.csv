Deal or no deal?,"Surrey Council called off a referendum on a 15% tax rise Deal or no deal? Jeremy Corbyn unusually had the better of Theresa May in Prime Minister's Questions, brandishing leaked texts across the despatch box, claiming evidence that the Tories had given Surrey a special deal to avoid the chance of a damaging 15% council tax rise in a Conservative safe haven. The council, and ministers, denied there had been any stitch-up. But hours later, the government admitted they had agreed, in theory, that Surrey County Council could, like several others, try out keeping all of the business rates they raise from 2018, which could plug the gaps in funding in future. That change is due to be in force across in England by 2020. Technically therefore, Surrey County Council has not been offered any additional funding. But the prospect of more flexibility over their own income in future could help fill the council's coffers, and seems to have eased some of their concerns. But as a solution to easing the pressure in social care across the country now, the idea could fall far short. Where there is high need for care for the elderly, there is likely to be a lower local tax base. Conversely, in more prosperous areas where councils can raise a lot of tax, there is likely to be less need for financial help. One local government leader told me ""all that would do is to lock in the existing iniquity to the system"". And major changes to how councils pay their way could make a difference in the long term. Many argue, the social care crisis is now. Medics, NHS leaders, local government leaders, MPs, former ministers, and of course many members of the public are day after day reporting concerns about the creaks in the social care system, arguing for big changes or big extra money. There are though few signs of any extra cash on the way in the Budget next month. Privately ministers are hunting for solutions. The prime minister's allies say she is prepared to be ""radical"". A Tory council might have been appeased by a promise to change their future funding - others may not be so easily satisfied.

Mark Simpson: How Karen Matthews made a fool out of me,"Karen Matthews came out of her house to talk to Mark Simpson Shannon Matthews's disappearance in a 2008 hoax-kidnapping is being recounted in a BBC drama.BBC News's Mark Simpson,external, who reported on the case, looks back at the deception. Karen Matthews made a fool out of me. I looked into her sunken eyes, saw that she was petrified and gave her the benefit of the doubt. Maybe my judgement was coloured by the fact that she chose to give me her first interview. Maybe it was clouded by seeing inside her small semi-detached house, and the grim conditions in which she and her seven children were living. Maybe I was so cold at the time, my brain froze. Karen's daughter Shannon, nine, disappeared on the coldest night of the year in February 2008. Shannon was missing for 24 days Police divers who searched a lake near her home in Dewsbury Moor in West Yorkshire had to break through ice to get into the water. The air temperature had dipped to -4C. The night Karen agreed to talk to me, I was shaking with cold after spending hour after hour talking live on the BBC News Channel (or BBC News 24 as it was then). Karen spotted me out of her front window and came out to talk. She was shaking too, but out of fear. She was scared - scared of being found out. She gave me no eye contact. She looked down the barrel of the BBC camera and said; ""Shannon if you're out there, please come home. We love you to bits, we miss you so much. Please, I'm begging you baby, come home."" Karen Matthews appeals for information on her daughter's disappearance When the police saw her interview on the BBC Ten O'Clock News, they were annoyed. They had advised her not to talk to the media. They were as surprised as me that she agreed to give me an interview. So was this erratic behaviour the first sign that all was not what it seemed? The kidnap hoax that shocked the UK BBC iPlayer: The Moorside, episode one In hindsight, it may seem so, but at the time, it seemed simply a desperate act by a desperate mother. Fresh in my mind were the Soham murders of schoolgirls Jessica Chapman and Holly Wells. When children disappeared for more than 48 hours, the outcome was usually not good. That is why there was such a huge community effort to try to find Shannon. People realised that time was short. Yes, I did wonder if Karen Matthews was telling the truth. Everyone did. However, I believed her. And I was not alone. As well as searching hedges and parkland, the police drew up a map showing where convicted paedophiles lived in the Dewsbury area. They checked, and double-checked. There was no sign of Shannon. As days turned to weeks, the more convinced detectives became that Shannon would not be coming home. However, Karen's friends and neighbours never gave up, and neither did the police. About 10% of the force's officers were put on the case and more than Â£3m was spent in what was one of the largest search operations since the hunt for the Yorkshire Ripper. Karen Matthews was jailed for eight years Shannon was eventually found, 24 days after she disappeared. A BBC colleague got a tip-off and phoned me. I was shopping in Ikea in Leeds at the time, and nearly dropped my phone on a multi-coloured Swedish rug when I heard the news. As I drove down the A6110 to Dewsbury, I wondered if Karen would give me an interview again. We could do it in the same spot where we had first spoken. The only difference would be that this time she would be with Shannon beside her. The tears would turn to cheers. For once, it would be a story with a happy ending. What a fool I was. It later emerged that Shannon had been kept drugged and hidden in the base of a divan bed by the very people appealing for her safe return. That September Karen, and Michael Donovan, the uncle of Karen's partner, went on trial for kidnap, false imprisonment and perverting the course of justice. They were jailed for eight years after the court heard about their plot to hide the child and claim a Â£50,000 reward that subsequently had been offered by the Sun.

Bank warns on 'lax financial rules',"This video can not be played Sir Jon Cunliffe: ""The UK, in order to be a successful financial centre, needs robust regulation"" The man responsible for financial stability at the Bank of England has warned against relaxing banking regulation, saying that such a move could damage the global economy. Sir Jon Cunliffe told the BBC that ""lax controls"" risked undoing progress that had been made since the financial crisis. ""We've made very substantial progress since the financial crisis, increasing the resilience of the financial sector and increasing its ability to support the economy in times of stress both nationally and in Europe and globally, including the US,"" Sir Jon told me. ""Those changes were necessary. ""None of us want to see again the sorts of events we saw between 2007 and 2009 and the costs of those events are still very clear. ""In order to have a resilient financial sector and consistent regulation internationally we need international standards, we need the reforms we have had and it is important we preserve them."" Sir Jon's comments come after suggestions that if Britain did not secure a good trade deal with the European Union following Brexit, the UK could become an offshore tax haven - encouraging businesses and banks to move to the country to avoid tougher regulations elsewhere. Donald Trump, via an executive order, has also announced there will be a review of the Dodd-Frank legislation in America. It was passed during the Obama presidency to control the use of complicated financial instruments by institutions, increase the amount of money banks are required to have available to avoid tax-payer funded bailouts and stop banks using their own money to invest in intricate equity and debt products for profit, what is called proprietary trading. Although it had many supporters for making banks more secure, it has also been attacked for making banks less able to lend and more risk averse, particularly smaller, regional banks which support local economies. Sir Jon, who is the deputy governor of the Bank responsible for financial stability, said that it was too early to say what the outcome of the reform proposals would be. He pointed out the executive order spoke about proportionate regulation and maintained the need to prevent bail outs which didn't seem ""out of line"" with global approaches to regulation. Sir Jon said it was necessary, as the Bank had done, to investigate problems of ""regulatory conflict"" and change the rules where there had been unintended consequences. But he warned that as the UK had a very large financial services sector - providing about 8% of the country's economic output - it was important that the highest standards were maintained. ""It is important we have proportionate, highest quality regulation - robust and in line with best international standards,"" he said. ""The UK - in order to be a successful financial centre, you need good regulation, you need robust regulation and you need regulators that have credibility and experience. ""One doesn't become successful as an international centre by having lax standards and by being open to crises and regulatory arbitrage [the use of regulatory loopholes to avoid banking costs]."" Sir Jon, a member of the Monetary Policy Committee which sets interest rates, said that the next move on interest rates, whether up or down, was ""balanced"". Yesterday another MPC member, Kristin Forbes, suggested that she was moving towards supporting a rate rise because growth was more robust than originally thought and inflation was rising. ""There are risks on the downside as well,"" Sir Jon said. ""That [the economy] will slow faster and that uncertainty effects will come in and have an impact. For me the risks are evenly balanced."" Sir Jon was speaking at the launch of new Bank research which showed that a third of companies surveyed admitted that they had not invested enough over the last five years. He said that investment was important to support economic growth and better productivity. Reasons for not investing included economic uncertainty, risk aversion following the financial crisis and a perception that there were still constraints on bank lending. The man responsible for financial stability at the Bank of England has warned against relaxing banking regulation, saying that such a move could damage the global economy.

Rosy signs for quality journalism market,"So perhaps people will pay for quality journalism after all. Subscriptions to leading British current affairs magazines, due to be published tomorrow, show a combination of Brexit, Trump and other cultural factors has led to an increase in the number of people handing over money to read smart stuff. Advance sighting of circulation figures for two leading publications - The Spectator and New Statesman - shows a clear pattern. For weekly or fortnightly publications that don't do general news, there is a growing willingness to pay for high-quality journalism - whether written, in the magazines, or video and audio online. This time last year, The Spectator had combined print and digital sales of 62,718, passing a record set in 2006. Of that, 55,165 were print (though print subscribers get access to digital content) and 7,553 were digital only. Now the combined print and digital figure is 67,120. Of this, 59,923 are print sales, and 7,197 are digital subscribers. In the second half of last year alone, print circulation rose by 3,270. Ipointed out earlier this weekDonald Trump has been a boon to the finances of much of the mainstream media - particularly in America. In Britain, Brexit was a more significant factor. Spectator editor Fraser Nelson told me: ""Brexit seems to have been the catalyst. News events since then (Trump, etc) have led to a lot more interest in high-quality news and analysis."" Other cultural factors are at play too. This is what really interests me - and Nelson: ""The market has changed. There's a lot more acceptance of the idea of paying for films, music and content in general. Fraser Nelson says Brexit has stimulated interest ""Netflix has helped pave the way for a change in culture. People who would not be seen dead paying for content five years ago are now in the habit of paying for Amazon Prime, music, the odd film and a subscription or two. ""We hear about Trump helping NY Times subscriptions, but I think it's more than that. The market has just turned, and is now welcoming to titles whose brand and quality is strong enough."" There is another factor: ""Weirdly, the phenomenon of fake news has also helped emphasise the importance of paying for edited content. Where you get your news from has never mattered more."" Nor is this phenomenon restricted to just one part of the political spectrum. People are paying for high-quality stuff regardless of their leaning. In his time as editor, Jason Cowley has made the New Statesman much less slavishly left-wing, picking fights with some figures on the left, such as Ed Miliband. I would say that the Statesman is now a magazine of scepticism rather than leftism. Of course, some of the smartest scepticism originates on the left: Bertrand Russell's Sceptical Essays is among the most important collections published in the 20th Century. Combined circulation is now 34,025 - of which 32,098 are print and 1,927 are digital - compared with a combined figure of 32,300 this time last year, and 24,000 in 2010. This is a 35-year high. In 2016 newstatesman.com hit 4 million monthly unique visitors and 27 million monthly page views - close to a 400% increase on 2011. Cowley told me: ""In an era of fake news, people are realising that good journalism is worth spending money on. While much of the liberal media has been struggling to survive in a declining market dominated by powerful media groups, the New Statesman has not merely held its position but expanded dramatically - all achievedâ¦ with no marketing spend."" A bright picture - but several caveats are necessary here. First, I don't yet have the age profile of new subscribers. It would be interesting to know a bit more about this. Second, many magazines are succumbing to the temptation to bundle print and digital numbers together. The attempt to conflate numbers is really a way of showing a bit of leg to advertisers. But it is a deliberate misrepresentation of the real picture. We can hardly take magazines seriously when they call out deceitful public figures if they play fast and loose with their own numbers. Third, there is a much broader story about web traffic, whether at general newspapers or specialist magazines. Fourth, the fact people are paying for high-quality magazine content does not mean that this model will necessarily work for newspapers. The Times, which has a paywall and is growing its subscriber base, has found a business model that works. The New York Times operates a metered paywall, but it has an editorial budget of over Â£300m, has a much vaster domestic target market than, say, The Independent and competes with fewer national newspapers in America. It is a curiosity of Britain that we have so many more national titles for our smaller population. The Financial Times, which also operates a metered paywall, is both a generalist and a specialist publication, because it does so much financial news. It also has the advantage that many of its readers are either rich or, because they work for companies dependent on that financial data, able to buy subscriptions on company expenses. So it is important not to read across from the success of weekly magazines, which deal in high-quality commentary and analysis, and say the same will necessarily work for daily newspapers. Their meat and drink is the much more generally available commodity of daily news, and in Britain they compete with the BBC website, whose reach is huge. Finally, for many publications, the growth in subscriptions will not offset the precipitous decline in display advertising across the market, which is not far off 20% down year on year, as eyeballs migrate to the web. The Spectator now gets two-thirds of its revenue from paying consumers rather than advertisers. The Economist magazine has argued publicly that it expects display advertising revenue to""pretty much vanish"",externalby 2025. The model for print media is being revolutionised. Those dependent solely or mainly on print advertising are in trouble, and will have to diversify their businesses. Those flaunting a generally available commodity - daily news - will have to do it better, present it more boldly, and manage costs more smartly. But now we know: those who specialise, and publish regularly but not daily, can ask people to pay, with confidence that they will. That's good news for journalism.

SportWinter Olympic medal chances 'exciting'8 February 2017 (22:35:44),"Could 2018 be a record-breaking Winter Olympics for Team GB? Great Britain should be excited about its medal chances at the 2018 Winter Olympics, according to chef de mission Mike Hay. It would be a record-breaking Games for Team GB in Pyeongchang if they win more than the four medals they have taken home on two occasions, in 1924 and 2014. UK Sport has doubled its investment in Olympic winter sports from Â£13.5m for the four-year cycle to the 2014 Sochi Games to Â£27.9m for the South Korea event. And with a year go until the 2018 Games begin, UK Sport has agreed a total target of between four and eight medals across the various Winter Olympic disciplines at their respective World Championship events this year. ""The money that UK Sport have put in is a real confidence boost to our winter athletes,"" Hay told BBC Sport. ""We've got to go in with high hopes and there are some early indicators that our athletes are going to be competing for podium places."" Great Britain may have won 67 medals in one Games at the 2016 summer Olympics in Rio but Winter Olympic medals have been harder to come by because of a lack of natural facilities and smaller talent pools to select from. In the 97-year history of the Winter Olympics, Great Britain have won only 26 medals but Hay believes the country is becoming more accepted on the world stage, especially in freestyle skiing and snowboarding, short track speed skating, curling and skeleton. ""It's very difficult to challenge the alpine nations but we're making progress into that second tier, if you like, and getting credibility,"" Hay said. Meanwhile, to mark a year to the event, British Ski and Snowboard has announced it plans to become one of the world's top five skiing and snowboarding nations by 2030. Great Britain will send about 60 athletes to the Games. Ski and snowboard:It took 90 years for Britain to win a first Winter Olympic medal on snow, courtesy ofJenny Jones' snowboard bronze in 2014but in Pyeongchang there could be podium ambitions for athletes in freestyle skiing, snowboarding and even alpine skiing. Snowboarder Katie Ormerod has been a model of consistency on the World Cup stage, winning the Moscow big air and claiming two other podiums as well as an X Games bronze medal. Her cousin Jamie Nicholls, Billy Morgan and Aimee Fuller have also won World Cup medals and could threaten the podium in slopestyle and big air in 2018. James Woods finished fifth in ski slopestyle in Sochi and will be a medal contender in South Korea. He won the season-opening World Cup slopestyle in New Zealand and just missed out on an X Games slopestyle medal, coming fourth. Woods did win the big air title in Aspen but only snowboard big air will make its debut in the Winter Olympics. In the alpine world, slalom specialist David Ryding became the first Briton for 36 years to claim a World Cup medal when he finished second in Kitzbuhel, Austria, in January and has backed that up with three other top 10s this season. British Ski and Snowboard has an ambitious target of being a top-five performing nation by 2030. It says it has a strategy to raise more funds and put a world-class coaching structure in place. This video can not be played Lizzy Yarnold's had a change of pace - making lampshades Short track speed skating:After the heartbreak of being penalised in all her races in Sochi,Elise Christiewill be determined to leave Pyeongchang with a medal. She is leading the world 500m standings this season and has also won World Cup medals in 1000m and 1500m. Charlotte Gilmartin could also claim a medal. Skeleton:Since skeleton was reintroduced into the Winter Olympics in 2002, Great Britain have won a medal at each of the four Games. Lizzy Yarnold won gold in Russia and is aiming to become the first Briton to retain a Winter Olympic title. She took the 2016 season off but is back and building up to South Korea. Laura Deas has had World Cup success and will also be in contention. Curling: Great Britain won silver and bronze in Sochi and will again be challenging for the medal matches in 2018. The introduction of mixed doubles boosts GB's chances even more. Snowboard big air:Snowboarders will head down a ramp and perform a trick off a large jump called a kicker. The new addition is great news for Britain's medal aspirations as there are podium potential athletes in the men's and women's competitions. Meanwhile, it is goodbye to snowboard parallel slalom, which has been dropped from the Games. Curling mixed doubles: Each team is made up of a man and a woman and they play with six stones, rather than the usual eight and there are only eight ends, instead of the traditional 10. Great Britain finished fourth at the 2016 World Championships and compete in the 2017 competition at the end of April. Performances from the 2016 and 2017 World Championships will be taken into account with the top seven ranked nations, plus hosts South Korea, qualifying for the Games. Speed skating mass start: This will take place on the long track and will be a 16-lap race where all skaters start simultaneously. There will be four sprints where points are awarded. The first three athletes to cross the finish line will be awarded the medals. Alpine skiing team event. Teams will consist of two men and two women and they will compete against other nations in head-to-head slalom races. The 2018 Winter Olympics will be held between 9 and 25 February and it is the third time Asia has held a Winter Olympics after Japan hosted both the 1972 Games in Sapporo and Nagano in 1998. Pyeongchang will be split between the coast and the mountains, similarly to Sochi. The coastal cluster will host curling, ice hockey, figure skating, short track and speed skating, while the mountain area will host skiing, snowboarding, bobsleigh, skeleton and luge. The winter Paralympics will run from 9 to 18 March. 'Concussion almost ended my ski career' Meet Britain's best ever cross-country skier.

The genius behind some of TV's greatest comedies,"Alan Simpson outside BBC Television Centre in 1970 Alan Simpson formed, with Ray Galton, one of the great television scriptwriting partnerships. Their early work with Tony Hancock pioneered what became known as situation comedy. They went on to create Steptoe and Son, which became the most watched comedy on TV over its 12-year run. But, although they continued to write, they failed to replicate the success of their early work. Alan Simpson was born in Brixton, London on 27 November 1929. After leaving school, he obtained a job as a shipping clerk before contracting tuberculosis. He became so ill that he was not expected to live and was given the last rites. However, he survived, and while a patient in a sanatorium in Surrey he found himself alongside another teenage TB sufferer named Ray Galton. Simpson (l) and Galton with Tony Hancock Galton never forgot his first sight of his future partner, 6ft 4in tall with a build to match. ""He was the biggest bloke I'd ever seen."" They discovered a shared love of American humorists such as Damon Runyon and had both listened to the BBC radio comedy programmes Take It From Here and The Goon Shows. Their first work together was for hospital radio. Have You Ever Wondered was based on their experiences in the sanatorium, which was played out in 1949. When Simpson left hospital he was asked by a local church concert party to write a show and he roped in Ray Galton to help. They also began sending one-liners to the BBC, which secured them a job writing for a struggling radio show called Happy-Go-Lucky. The pair also linked up with several other promising new comedy writers and performers  of the time, notably Eric Sykes, Peter Sellers, Frankie Howerd and Tony Hancock. They were quickly tiring of the format of radio comedy shows of the time which included music, sketches and one-liners, and hankered after something with more depth. They came up with the idea of comedy where all the humour came from the situations in which characters find themselves. Tony Hancock liked the idea and Hancock's Half Hour was born. Steptoe and Son carried elements of black comedy and social realism It is often credited as the first true radio sitcom, although two other shows of the time, A Life of Bliss and Life with the Lyons, were already using the format in 1954 when Hancock first aired. Over the following five years the writers developed the format, often taking cues from a new generation of playwrights such as John Osborne and Harold Pinter. The pace of each show became slow and more measured, in direct contrast to the speedy wise-cracking delivery of contemporary radio comedians such as Ted Ray. Simpson himself appeared in early episodes as the unknown man who had to suffer Hancock's interminable monologues. In 1956 the series transferred to TV and ran until 1961. The final series was just entitled Hancock and it was that run which featured the best-known shows including The Blood Donor (""It was either that or join the Young Conservatives"") and The Radio Ham, in which Hancock proves completely incapable of responding to a distress signal from a sinking yachtsman. Hancock, who was becoming increasingly self-critical and drinking heavily, sacked his writers in 1961. Unwilling to lose them, the BBC commissioned them to write scripts for Comedy Playhouse, a series of one-off sitcoms. One play, entitled, The Offer, spawned Steptoe and Son, the tale of two rag-and-bone merchants, a father and son, living in Oil Drum Lane, Shepherd's Bush. They remained close friends after their writing partnership ended The script relied on the clash between the two characters; Albert, the grasping father with none too hygienic personal habits and Harold, his aspirational son who yearns for a better life but never achieves it. The show was unusual in that the two performers, Wilfrid Brambell and Harry H Corbett, were actors rather than comedians. The original four series ran between 1962 and 1965 and the show was revived between 1970 and 1974, during which time two feature film versions were also released. It proved to be the high point for the duo. There was further work with Frankie Howerd and, in 1977, Yorkshire TV attempted to replicate the success of Comedy Playhouse with Galton & Simpson's Playhouse, although none of the episodes produced a series. Simpson quit writing in 1978 to pursue his other business interests although he and Galton remained close friends. In 1996 they reunited to update some of their best-known scripts for the comedian Paul Merton. Simpson blamed their later lack of popularity on the fact that shows were commissioned by armies of managers rather than producers.

What did Trump mean by the term 'Easy D'?,"President Donald Trump has again lambasted the judicial rulings keeping him from enforcing his travel ban - but this time his tweet had a curious turn of phrase. ""Big increase in traffic into our country from certain areas, while our people are far more vulnerable, as we wait for what should be EASY D!""he wrote at 12:41 Washington time.,external It was just one of a string of tweets defending his executive order, which banned entry to the US from citizens from seven countries deemed a high risk for terrorism. It has been put on hold while judges across the country assess its legality. But the use of  ""EASY D"" left the Twitterati scratching their heads. ""I think the one thing uniting the country rn [right now] is that none of us, regardless of political affiliation, knows what ""Easy D"" is,"" wrote Teen Vogue'sLily Herman,external. Some were certain they knew: ""Spoiler alert: D means decision,"" wroteCNN's Jon Ostrower,external. (Others argued that it meant ""defence"", a commonly used abbreviation in sports.) Most were less concerned about the meaning and more interested in the opportunity to make a quick joke. ""I mistakenly thought Easy D was NWA's older brother,"" wroteESPN's Jane McManus,external. ""Don't make him switch out Easy D for Hard D,"" warned frequent Trump criticArthur Chu,external. The single-theme joke account @TrumpDraws,externalgot into the act with a new image playing on the Easy D reference. ""The media never wants to talk about the people Easy D slaughtered at Bowling Green,"" quippedVox writer Matt Yglesias,external, referring to the non-existent massacre mistakenly mentioned by Trump strategist Kellyanne Conway. ScreenwriterRandi Mayem Singer,externaljoked about Trump's earlier tweet, jeering the retailer Nordstrom for dropping his daughter Ivanka's fashion line. ""I just got measured at Nordstrom.  Was wearing an Easy D, but I should be an Easy DDD."" Still, while the anti-Trump crowd had fun laughing it up on Twitter, they have had less success stopping Trump's cabinet appointments. So far all of his picks remain on track to confirmation, and even the most hotly-contested nomination, Betsy DeVos, was approved by the Senate. Meanwhile, Trump supporters say their man is doing exactly what they elected him to do - keep the country safe and disrupt government business as usual.

Who gets social care and who pays for it?,"We know our population is ageing and, as we live longer, many of us will need support in old age. There has also been an increase in the numbers of people living with a disability who may rely on some level of social care. Niall Dickson, the head of the NHS Confederation, which represents NHS providers, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that the system was trying to cope with ""huge amounts of extra demand"" as a result of there being ""many many more"" older people. Between 2005 and 2015, the number of people aged 65 and over in the UK increased by 21%, while the number aged 85 and over increased by 31%. More than a million more people were living with a disability in the UK in 2016 than 10 years earlier because people are living longer with disabilities than before. This is all good news. But at the same time, directors of adult social services in England say they have had to cut Â£4.6bn from their budgets since 2010. So who is getting care, what kind of care are they getting and who is paying for it? Unlike the NHS, in England social care is not free at the point of delivery - a lot of people have to pay for at least some of their care, and a lot of that care is delivered by private providers. That can be anything from someone coming to your house to help you get out of bed or washed, to full-time accommodation in a care home. It's a little different in the rest of the UK - home care is capped at Â£60 a week in Wales and free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland, while Scotland provides free personal care, that is help with things such as washing and dressing, in both care homes and people's own homes. The UK Homecare Association estimates that more than 70% of homecare services in the UK are bought by local authorities, with the rest bought by people paying for their care themselves. In 2014-15, that equated to 646,000 people being cared for in their homes with the state paying. This doesn't necessarily mean 70% of people who need care at home are paid for by the state. In 2015, Age UK estimated that more than a million older people in England were living with unmet social care needs (such as not receiving assistance with bathing and dressing), a rise from 800,000 in 2010. People not eligible for funding may just be doing without the care they really need or relying on informal care from friends and family. When it comes to residential care, the latest figures from 2014 suggest local authorities across the UK paid for 37% of people, while the NHS funded 10% of care home places. The rest was made up of people who either paid for all of their care (41%), or topped it up with a contribution from their local council (12%). On 31 March 2016, in England, there were 199,305 people in nursing and residential home places and 452,990 people accessing long-term care in the community for whom the local council had some role in funding or providing care or assessing the needs of the person receiving it. The most recent data doesn't tell us how many people were cared for overall in England, but we can say that there were 1.8 million requests for support in 2015-16. Of those, 28% were from people aged 18-64 and the remaining 72% were aged 65 and over. But of these requests, 57% resulted in no direct support from the council. For the over-65 group, almost a quarter of requests for support were from people being discharged from hospital. Think tank the King's Fund says the number of older people getting state-funded help in England alone fell by 26% between 2009 and 2014. This is in the context of an ageing population. The government has said English councils' social care departments are getting an extra Â£3.5bn by 2020. Almost Â£2bn of this comes from council tax, which local authorities have been allowed to raise by 3% this year and next year provided they spend it on adult social care.

Did we report Trump 'under-reported' attacks?,"This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""All over Europe it's happening. It's gotten to a point where [attacks are] not even being reported."" US President Donald Trump has accused the media of under-reporting terror attacks, and produced a list to back up his claim. Is he right? While on a visit to US Central Command, a wing of the Department of Defense, he warned of the danger posed by the Islamic State group. ""You have seen what happened in Paris and Nice. All over Europe it's happening,"" he said. ""It's gotten to a point where it's not even being reported. And in many cases the very, very dishonest press doesn't want to report it. ""They have their reasons, and you understand that."" Later in the day, the White House published a list of attacks ""executed or inspired"" by IS. Before the list was published, press secretary Sean Spicer said there were ""several instances"" of attacks that had not gained sufficient media coverage (without specifying which fell into that category). We have reproduced the list below, explaining in each case what happened and whether we reported on it. Of the 78 incidents listed by the White House, we did not report only 12 of them - some were so minor they received barely any coverage elsewhere. Just because the BBC covered an attack does not mean that incident was not under-reported, although it is unclear whether Mr Trump was referring to US or global news organisations. And some terrorist incidents do get more coverage than others, a point that has been hotly debated on social media. Most of the atrocities listed by the White House were committed by Islamists, and the killing of nine black worshippers by a self-avowed white supremacist in South Carolina is notably absent. Absent too is the 2016 bombing of a shopping centre in Baghdad that killed some 300 people, and last week's deadly assault on a mosque in Quebec City. What happened: A teenager was shot dead after he stabbed two police officers. He was a ""known terror suspect"" whose passport had been cancelled on security grounds. Did we cover it?Yes.

Star who lost voice up for Folk Awards,"Shirley Collins is best known for the album Anthems in Eden, which she recorded in 1969 with her sister, Dorothy Folk star Shirley Collins, who was robbed of her voice for 30 years by an emotional crisis, has been nominated for two Radio 2 Folk Awards. The 81-year-old is up for singer of the year, while Lodestar, her first record since 1978, is up for best album. Collins was an immensely important figure in Britain's folk-rock scene in the 1960s, thanks to her pared-down singing style and strong storytelling. But her career was cut short by the end of her marriage in the late 1970s. The star's second husband, Ashley Hutchings, left her for a young actress who took to showing up at Collins' performances. One night, during a performance of Lark Rise at London's National Theatre, she froze on-stage and found herself unable to sing. ""It was humiliating,""she told BBC Radio 4's Mastertapes last year. ""Some nights when I opened my mouth nothing would come out, or just a few croaks would come out. ""It went on night after night after night, for far too long. I was trying to sing through tears. I was just in a state."" ""I never lost the desire to sing,"" she added. ""It was really heartbreaking for me not to be able to. [But] I couldn't even sing indoors. I couldn't sing to myself."" Collins developed a form of dysphonia, a condition often associated with psychological trauma. In the years that followed, she wrote books while working in charity shops and a job centre ""for five ghastly years"" to support herself. But her music was discovered by a younger generation of fans - including Blur's Graham Coxon and the Decemberists' Colin Meloy - and, eventually, she was coaxed back onto the stage, releasing her new album to wide acclaim last year. Collins is nominated for singer of the year alongside Ireland's Daoiri Farrell, Scottish musician Kris Drever, and five-time Folk Award winner Jim Causley. Farrell has the most nominations, three in all, while Songs of Separation  - a project inspired by the Scottish referendum, featuring Eliza Carthy, Karine Polwart and Jenny Hill - has two. Woody Guthrie is one of the most influential figures in folk and popular music US folk icon Woody Guthrie will be inducted to the Folk Awards Hall of Fame on the 50th anniversary of his death. The author of classics such as I Ain't Got No Home, Pretty Boy Floyd and This Train Is Bound For Glory, his songs were a major influence on popular music, and have been covered by the likes of Van Morrison, Bruce Springsteen and Bob Dylan. Just this week, Lady Gaga sang a portion of his civil rights anthem This Land Is Your Land in a thinly-veiled attack on Donald Trump at the Super Bowl. Billy Bragg, who made a Grammy award-winning album with Wilco based on unused Woody Guthrie lyrics, will pay tribute to the star with a headline performance at the awards. Scottish singer-songwriter Al Stewart, best known for the hit single Year Of The Cat, will also perform, after being honoured with the lifetime achievement award. Mark Radcliffe and Julie Fowlis will present the awards at London's Royal Albert Hall on Wednesday, 5 April. The ceremony will be broadcast live on BBC Radio 2.

Laura Kuenssberg: Deal or no deal?,"Surrey Council called off a referendum on a 15% tax rise Deal or no deal? Jeremy Corbyn unusually had the better of Theresa May in Prime Minister's Questions, brandishing leaked texts across the despatch box, claiming evidence that the Tories had given Surrey a special deal to avoid the chance of a damaging 15% council tax rise in a Conservative safe haven. The council, and ministers, denied there had been any stitch-up. But hours later, the government admitted they had agreed, in theory, that Surrey County Council could, like several others, try out keeping all of the business rates they raise from 2018, which could plug the gaps in funding in future. That change is due to be in force across in England by 2020. Technically therefore, Surrey County Council has not been offered any additional funding. But the prospect of more flexibility over their own income in future could help fill the council's coffers, and seems to have eased some of their concerns. But as a solution to easing the pressure in social care across the country now, the idea could fall far short. Where there is high need for care for the elderly, there is likely to be a lower local tax base. Conversely, in more prosperous areas where councils can raise a lot of tax, there is likely to be less need for financial help. One local government leader told me ""all that would do is to lock in the existing iniquity to the system"". And major changes to how councils pay their way could make a difference in the long term. Many argue, the social care crisis is now. Medics, NHS leaders, local government leaders, MPs, former ministers, and of course many members of the public are day after day reporting concerns about the creaks in the social care system, arguing for big changes or big extra money. There are though few signs of any extra cash on the way in the Budget next month. Privately ministers are hunting for solutions. The prime minister's allies say she is prepared to be ""radical"". A Tory council might have been appeased by a promise to change their future funding - others may not be so easily satisfied.

Lucy Williamson: How will blue collar France vote?,"Hayange is not a place of metaphors, but the relics of its shuttered steel furnaces seem to signal something unresolved. They stalk the landscape around France's north-eastern villages, looming over a new political age. This was once the thriving heart of France's steel industry. In the past decade, unemployment has risen by 75%, and around a quarter of the working population now crosses the border to Luxembourg each day for work. This was once staunch left-wing country; communists and socialists ran this place together. But the past few years have seen left-wing votes shrivel, while those for the National Front (FN) have more than doubled, pushing it into the lead. In the market, there are many who are happy to say they vote FN, though not always to give their name. ""I'm for the National Front. I'm not afraid to say it,"" one woman told me. ""I'm not totally in favour of them but it's my way of saying that I'm not happy with today's politics. ""I think we've left the door open to too much immigration.  Employment is in decline. We give, we give, we give to everyone. And I think that's why you chose Brexit, and I absolutely approve of that."" The National Front is promising France its own referendum on ""Frexit"" or exit from the EU, if it wins power in May. It's also promising to clamp down on immigration and give French people priority when it comes to jobs and housing. Hayange is one of a number of towns controlled by Marine Le Pen's National Front The National Front has never managed to win power at the regional or the national level, but now controls a dozen towns in France, including Hayange. And the man elected as FN mayor here, Fabien Engelmann, was once himself a union man from the far left. The party presents itself as defending France's ""forgotten ones"" - against crime, immigration, and economic change. ""The left betrayed its voters, betrayed the workers, the middle class, the shop owners,"" Mr Engelmann told me. ""There's also mass immigration today, and I think that after a while you can't welcome the poor from across the world.  We have to stop this immigration and take care of our own."" France election: Far-right's Le Pen rails against globalisation Emmanuel Macron: France's ambitious man 'on the move' Fillon payment inquiry: What you need to know But the election of Mayor Engelmann has been divisive here, partly because political loyalties themselves are dividing more sharply. After years of trying to boost the economy by pushing through liberal reforms, the Socialist Party is deeply unpopular with many blue collar workers, who say they feel abandoned and ignored, as industries close and jobs become less secure. It didn't help that, before he became president, Francois Hollande visited Hayange during his election campaign to promise that the blast furnaces here wouldn't close. They did. Hayange's blast furnaces are now closed After that, votes for the Socialist Party began to plummet, as supporters turned towards the political margins for answers - both the far left, and the far right. Patrice Hainy was one of those converts. Fed up with the attitudes of France's more established parties, he responded to a National Front leaflet pushed through his door, and ended up joining the party, as a deputy mayor. Patrice lives on one of the old steel-workers' estates, built here in the 19th Century by the wealthy family who built the industry from scratch. According to local historians, it was part of a new vision back then to provide workers with everything they might need from cradle to grave: hospitals, schools, canteens, even holiday camps. Now Patrice, living in a relic of that industrial heyday, says it's the sense of being ignored that leaves left-wing voters open to the FN. ""I was attracted to them because the other parties don't listen to the people, and I believed the FN was listening to me,"" he explained. ""It attracts weak members from the left.  I was from the left and I was angry with our politicians who are sacrificing French people."" But within a year of joining the party, Patrice had left, disillusioned by what he describes as the National Front's ""repression"", and anti-Muslim views. He's planning to vote for a left-wing candidate in the presidential elections this year, but says voters should not underestimate the appeal of FN leader Marine Le Pen. ""I think she might have a chance, because what is happening at a national level is what's already happened in my town,"" he said. ""The FN voters go and vote, the others don't because they're so disgusted with politics."" Despite all the changes, the boxing club in Hayange remains open The FN's fiercest critics, like nurse Gilles Wobedo, are trying to draw together opposition voices, to protest against what they see as divisive and partisan policies by the mayor. ""The National Front attacks democracy in this town,"" he told me. ""For the past three years, they have divided people: young against old, Muslims against Catholics, workers against the unemployed. The mayor has divided the population and maintains his grip with a small majority."" But, he says, it's hard to build momentum because the opposition parties here are so divided - each hoping to win back power for themselves. Not too dissimilar to the problems the left is facing at the national level, with left-wing votes divided between three different figures in the presidential campaign: the socialists' Benoit Hamon, the far-left leader Jean-Luc Melenchon and the independent centrist Emmanuel Macron. One relic of Hayange that has survived is its boxing club. A place for its young men to forget France's politicians, and learn how to win - and lose - for themselves.  One of the boxers there, Frank, says a vote for the FN is still a vote of protest and desperation for many people here. ""On the left, we've had the Socialist Party in the past; but it doesn't work,"" he said. ""So now, we would like to try something different. I think it's a last solution."" What if that solution also fails, I ask him? He shrugs. In the ring, it's easy to judge promises against performance. In politics, it's often past performance that loses elections; and promises that win.

Report card,"Emilie Telander (right) says she is more tired now she is back on eight-hour days Sweden has been experimenting with six-hour days, with workers getting the chance to work fewer hours on full pay, but now the most high-profile two-year trial has ended - has it all been too good to be true? Assistant nurse Emilie Telander, 26, cheers as one of the day patients at Svartedalen's elderly care home in Gothenburg manages to roll a six in a game of Ludo. But her smile fades as she describes her own luck running out at the end of the year, when after 23 months of six-hour shifts, she was told to go back to eight-hour days. ""I feel that I am more tired than I was before,"" she reflects, lamenting the fact that she now has less time at home to cook or read with her four-year-old daughter. ""During the trial all the staff had more energy. I could see that everybody was happy."" Gothenburg has been experimenting with shorter working days - but the policy isn't cheap Ms Telander is one of about 70 assistant nurses who had their days shortened for the experiment,the most widely reported of a handful of trials in Swedeninvolving a range of employers, from start-ups to nursing homes. Designed to measure well-being in a sector that's struggling to recruit enough staff to care for the country's ageing population, extra nurses were brought in to cover the lost hours. The project's independent researchers were also paid to study employees at a similar care home who continued to work regular days. Their final report is due out next month, but data released so far strongly backs Ms Telander's arguments. Gothenburg's move has put a shorter working day ""on the agenda both for Sweden and for Europe"", says Daniel Bernmar During the first 18 months of the trial the nurses working shorter hours logged less sick leave, reported better perceived health and boosted their productivity by organising 85% more activities for their patients, from nature walks to sing-a-longs. However, the project also faced tough criticism from those concerned that the costs outweighed the benefits. Centre-right opponents filed a motion calling on Gothenburg City Council to wrap it up prematurely last May, arguing it was unfair to continue investing taxpayers' money in a pilot that was not economically sustainable. Saved from the axe at the eleventh hour, the trial managed to stay within budget, but still cost the city about 12 million kronor (Â£1.1m; $1.3m). ""Could we do this for the entire municipality? The answer is no, it will be too expensive,"" says Daniel Bernmar, the Left Party councillor responsible for running Gothenburg's elderly care. But he argues the experiment still proved ""successful from many points of view"" by creating extra jobs for 17 nurses in the city, reducing sick pay costs and fuelling global debates about work culture. Sweden's 40-hour working week is likely to remain ""It's put the shortening of the work day on the agenda both for Sweden and for Europe, which is fascinating,"" he says. ""In the past 10, 15 years there's been a lot of pressure on people working longer hours and this is sort of the contrary of that."" Yet while work-life balance is already championed across the political spectrum in Sweden, the chances of the Nordic country trimming back its standard 40-hour week remain slim. On a national level, the Left Party is the only parliamentary party in favour of shortening basic working hours, backed by just 6% of voters in Sweden's last general election. Nevertheless, a cluster of other Swedish municipalities are following in Gothenburg's footsteps, with locally funded trials targeting other groups of employees with high levels of illness and burnout, including social workers and hospital nurses. Cleaners at Skelleftea Hospital will begin an 18-month project next month. Erik Gatenholm and Gabriel Peres found a shorter working day more problematic There's also been an increase in pilots in the private sector, with advertising, consulting, telecoms and technology firms among those testing the concept. Yet while some have also reported that staff appear calmer or are less likely to phone in sick, others have swiftly abandoned the idea. ""I really don't think that the six-hour day fits with an entrepreneurial world, or the start-up world,"" argues Erik Gatenholm, chief executive of Gothenburg-based bio-ink company. He is candid enough to admit he tested the method on his production staff after ""reading about the trend on Facebook"" and musing on whether it could be an innovative draw for future talent. But the firm's experiment was ditched in less than a month, after bad feedback from employees. ""I thought it would be really fun, but it felt kind of stressful,"" says Gabriel Peres, as he slots a Petri dish inside one of the 3D printers he's built for the company. ""It's a process and it takes time and when you don't have all that [much] time it kind of feels like skipping homework at school, things are always building up."" More research is being done on Sweden's shifting work patterns On the other side of the country, his concerns are shared by Dr Aram Seddigh, who recently completed his doctorate at Stockholm University's Stress Research Institute and is among a growing body of academics focusing on the nation's shifting work patterns. ""I think the six-hour work day would be most effective in organisations - such as hospitals - where you work for six hours and then you just leave [the workplace] and go home. ""It might be less effective for organisations where the borders between work and private life are not so clear,"" he suggests. ""This kind of solution might even increase stress levels given that employees might try to fit all the work that they have been doing in eight hours into six - or if they're office workers they might take the work home."" Back in Gothenburg, Bengt Lorentzon, the lead researcher for the Svartedalen care home project, argues that the concept of six-hour days also jars with the strong culture of flexible working promoted by many Swedish businesses. Improving your working life is not just about how long your day is, says Bengt Lorentzon ""A lot of offices are already working almost like consultancies. There's no need for managers to have all their workers in the office at the same time, they just want to get the results and people have to deliver,"" he says. ""Compare that to the assistant nurses - they can't just leave work to go to the dentist or to the doctors or the hairdressers."" ""So I don't think people should start with the question of whether or not to have reduced hours. ""First, it should be: what can we do to make the working environment better? And maybe different things can be better for different groups. ""It could be to do with working hours and working times, but it could be a lot of other things as well.""

"The classic ""It girl""","Tara Palmer-Tomkinson - first identified as an It girl on a Tatler magazine front cover - was a firm favourite of event organisers and newspaper photographers, writes John Hand, because, whatever the occasion, she was ever-willing to throw on her best dress, flash her best smile and add a touch of glamour to proceedings. While the term âIt girlâ originally dated from 1927, Tara Palmer-Tomkinson (often shortened to TPT) embodied a new generation of socialites whose antics and pictures at Londonâs most exclusive clubs and events helped to fill and expand newspaper gossip columns from the 1990s onwards. And Tara was among the best connected â from a wealthy family with real connections to royalty. Tara was born in Hampshire in 1971. Her father Charles Palmer-Tomkinson is a wealthy landowner and philanthropist and her mother Patti is a former model. Prince Charles is a good friend of the family and was once photographed sharing a strictly platonic kiss with Tara at Kloster's ski resort in Switzerland. Tara grew up in Hampshire and attended Sherborne School for Girls before a short stint working at Rothschild bank in London. Here she is pictured aged 16 with family pet Wellington. Throughout her life, Tara (pictured second left with her sister Santa, Prince Charles and Prince Harry) remained loyal to the Royal Family and was a regular guest on ski-ing holidays. But she was never indiscreet about the times she spent watching the young princes William and Harry grow up. While her life as a London socialite in her early 20s was being documented in her own Sunday Times column, it was accompanied by a growing problem with cocaine use. It all came to a head with an appearance on the Frank Skinner Show in 1999, in which she slurred her words, struggled to remember her host's name and asked him ""Are you married or are you single and what are you doing later?"". The TV appearance was quickly followed by a spell in rehab. She discussed her many low moments during a memorable, but searingly honest, interview with Piers Morgan for his TV show Tabloid Tales. Redemption came in an unlikely setting for a glamorous girl-about-town. She flew to the Australian jungle in 2002 to take part in the first series of ITV's new show I'm A Celebrity... Get Me Out Of Here. Her sense of fun helped her become such a hit with viewers that she came second only to Tony Blackburn. Tara was back on top again and flavour of the month once more - landing a fun modelling assignment showing off the ""Cantonese Spring Onion"" skirt and bodice for Walkers Crisps All kinds of events were given a touch of TPT glamour, including the Fish and Chip Shop of the Year awards. Having been a big music fan all her life, Tara was given the chance to show a long-hidden talent when she competed on Comic Relief Does Fame Academy. She is seen here performing a group number with Tricia Penrose, Angellica Bell and Mel Giedroyc. And the series ended in triumph for Tara as she beat Colin Murray, Tricia Penrose and Shaun Williamson in the final. Finally the classic ""It girl"" had become a Hit girl. Having previously performed with the National Symphony Orchestra, she made a bid for pop stardom at the age of 40, writing her own single 5 Seconds. She performed the plaintive love song live on Loose Women but it did not make the charts. Through all her ups and downs, she remained close to the Royal Family and was among a select number of guests when Prince Charles married Camilla in Windsor in 2005. By the time of Prince William's wedding to Catherine Middleton at Westminster Abbey, Tara - pictured with her sister Santa - was confident enough to wear an outfit she had designed herself. Four years later, she launched her own fashion line, Desiderata London. She revealed in late 2016 that she had been receiving treatment for a brain tumour since the start of the year. Several months later, she was found dead at her home.

Cold and tired?,"Tiredness and 'brain fog' are common symptoms of the condition Hypothyroidism - or an underactive thyroid - affects one in 70 women and one in 1,000 men according to the NHS. But it can be a tricky disease to diagnose and treat. Dr Michael Mosley, of Trust Me I'm a Doctor, asks if sufferers are slipping through the net. Someone emailed me the other day to ask me if I had ever considered the possibility that I might have hypothyroidism; an underactive thyroid. The reason he contacted me is because he had seen me on television and noticed that I have quite faint eyebrows, which can be a sign of this disorder. I have none of the other symptoms such as weight gain, tiredness and feeling the cold easily, so I've decided not to go and get myself tested. But if you do - and you think you could you have it - what should you do about it? To get some answers I've been talking to Dr Anthony Toft, who is a former president of the British Thyroid Association. He tells me that the thyroid gland is a bit like the accelerator pedal on your car. It produces hormones which help control the energy balance in your body. If it's underactive, then your metabolic rate will be slower than it should be. This means that you are likely to put on weight. Other symptoms can include feeling too cold or too hot, lacking in energy, being constipated, low mood, poor attention or ""brain fog"". Dr Mosley's 'faint eyebrows' led one doctor to contact him about hypothyroidism The main hormones involved are thyroid stimulating hormone (TSH), T4 and T3. TSH is released by the pituitary gland and tells your thyroid to get going. In response your thyroid should release the hormones T4 and T3. T4 is converted in your body into T3, the active hormone that revs up your cells. If you have symptoms of hypothyroidism then your GP will probably test your blood. The signs they're looking for are high levels of TSH, together with low levels of T4. If your TSH is higher than normal this suggests that the gland that produces this hormone - the pituitary gland - is working hard to tell the thyroid gland to produce more hormone, but for some reason the thyroid gland is not listening. The pituitary then ups its game and produces more and more TSH, but T4 levels stay low. So if you have a high TSH coupled with a low T4, it's likely that the body is saying ""I need more thyroid hormone!"" but the thyroid gland isn't doing what it's being told.  The result is hypothyroidism. When this happens patients are often prescribed levothyroxine (T4). Symptoms diminish and patients are happy. Scans can be carried out for more serious thyroid problems So if it's so straightforward, why are there so many forums full of dissatisfied patients?  Why do we at Trust Me get so many emails about this subject? One of the issues with the blood tests is that there are no standard international reference ranges. In the UK, for example, we set the bar rather higher than many other countries. Certainly Dr Toft thinks that current UK guidelines are sometimes interpreted too rigidly. ""If the T4 is right down at the lower limit of normal,"" he says, ""and the TSH is at the upper limit of normal, then that is suspicious. It doesn't often arouse suspicion in GPs, but it should."" He is also concerned that when a GP does diagnose an underactive thyroid, then patients are almost always prescribed a synthetic version of T4. This works most of the time but in some cases the symptoms don't improve. This might be because with some patients the problem is not an underactive thyroid, but the fact that they can't convert enough T4 into the active hormone T3. One way round this is to take T3 hormone in tablet form, but here price is a problem. ""The cost of T3 has escalated incredibly,"" says Dr Toft. ""It's now about Â£300 for two months' supply of T3, whereas it costs pennies to make."" Underactive thyroid (NHS Choices),external Trust Me, I'm A Doctoris on BBC Two at 20:00 GMT, Wednesday 8 February -catch up on BBC iPlayer How can I tell if I have a thyroid problem and what can I do about it? From episode 1 - Which foods can improve your gut bacteria? The man with a titanium chest So if you have been put on T4 and it doesn't work, what about asking for a trial of T3? Because it is so expensive your GP may well say no. So instead some patients are going online and buying T3 from foreign websites. But it's important that if you are taking T3 you are being properly monitored, because it can cause serious side effects, including heart problems. A slightly less expensive hormone supplement taken from the glands of cows and pigs is available. It contains both the T3 and T4 hormones, and there is a growing call to prescribe it for patients who don't respond to T4 alone. So does Dr Toft think patients should be offered this combination? ""I suspect that in time that's what will happen,"" he says. ""The trouble is the evidence base is not as strong as we would wish it to be, and I suspect it will be a long time before we have sufficient evidence."" Dealing with thyroid problems can be complicated. If you've had a blood test and the results have come back normal, then you can ask to look at the actual numbers. But you may also have to accept that medication is not for you and lifestyle changes may be more appropriate.

The chilling truth,"Our fridges are stuffed with food that could also be kept in the cupboard. In the past, people kept butter, eggs and sauces in the pantry without getting ill. So why do many of us insist on keeping it all chilled? A supermarket has begun stockingketchup in the fridge,externalsection as well as on shelves in a bid to appease both camps. Asda's poll of some 2,600 people found opinion was split, with 54% saying ketchup belonged in the cupboard and 46% saying they stored it in the fridge. Some shoppers took to social media to say which part of the shop they would be heading towards. But Polly Russell, a food historian from BBC Two's Back In Time For Dinner, said modern-day food chilling could be ""bizarre"". Many brands we recognise today, such as Lea & Perrins Worcestershire Sauce, HP Sauce and Heinz Tomato Ketchup, were all sold before households had fridges, she explains. ""They were absolute life-savers for housekeepers - adding flavour to food that might be slightly bland or monotonous,"" Dr Russell said. Their acidity levels, coupled with salt and sugar content, means they were - and still are - microbiologically safe to keep at room temperature. ""Households had no fridge, only cool boxes, or ice deliveries if it was a wealthy family."" The 1900s kitchen recreated in Further Back In Time For Dinner In the latest series of Further Back In Time For Dinner, the Robshaw family are sent to a 1900s house - finding a kitchen with a cool-cupboard and overstuffed parlour instead of a fridge or freezer. So when did this change? As late as 1961, 20% of British households had a fridge, Dr Russell's research found. Yet half of these households probably owned a television. It was only from 1968 that half of Britons owned a fridge. What does your fridge reveal about you? Nearly 70 years on, we are fridge-obsessed. Ms Russell said there was now an ""increased anxiety"" over food safety, meaning that we tend to chill foods when we do not need to. ""Shoppers don't trust the food they buy and hear mixed messages about what is and isn't safe,"" she said. Only half of households had a fridge in the late '60s But some people are attempting to resist our reliance on refrigeration. ""If we get more people into preserving food, we can reduce the need for a fridge,"" says Caroline Aitken, a food preservation teacher from Dartmoor. Mrs Aitken, 38, teaches ""permaculture"", a movement that began in the 1970s and promotes self-sufficiency, growing food naturally and minimising waste. Caroline Aitken says it is fine to leave cooked food in a cool room ""We've gradually lost our larders and now we've got very hot centrally heated houses,"" she said, adding that there was a ""cultural fear"" of leaving food out of the fridge. She suggests pickling food from scratch using salt and water and keeping sugary preserves such as jam in the larder. ""Sauerkraut and kimchee are great to experiment with,"" she said. ""I generally add three tablespoons of salt for every two kilos of shredded vegetables."" Mrs Aitken says people can go ""over the top"" with keeping food in the fridge, even once it has been cooked. ""You can have cold-store outside,"" she said. ""If I've cooked a big stew I sit the pot in a room with a stone floor and it's perfectly fine to have the next day."" According to the government, the electricity costs of running a fridge bought in 2013 over a 12.5-year lifespan will total about Â£270, although it may be difficult to do without one altogether. Even Mrs Aitken says she keeps some things, like her homemade yoghurt, in the fridge. ""I just don't go over the top: tomatoes, citrus fruits, eggs, they shouldn't be in there."" Ketchup: It may have an altered taste or colour if kept in the cupboard, but  the sauce's acidity means it will be safe to eat. Tomatoes: Storing them at 5ËC can affect their flavour by reducing the activity of enzyme-producing genes, according to research. Bananas: Will last longer in the fridge but should be left outside to ripen first. Avocados: Also will not ripen properly if they're put in the fridge while still hard. Eggs: Best stored in the fridge as they will be kept at a constant temperature, NHS advice states. Leftovers: Cool them within two hours if possible and refrigerate, but eat within two days. Bread: Can dry out and go stale more quickly in the fridge, but can be frozen. Onions and potatoes: Best stored in a cool, dark cupboard. Butter: Keep it in the fridge, especially if it is unsalted, but its fatty content means it can last at room temperature for a day or two.

Banned,"This video can not be played Watch: How Munther Alaskry got his family to the US An Iraqi translator who worked extensively with the US military spent almost seven years trying to get his family to America. But with days to go before their departure, President Trump signed a travel ban that put the family's future in question. Baghdad, Iraq It took seven years for Munther Alaskry to secure visas for his family. Now, they were only four days away from a new life in Houston, Texas, where friends and an apartment were waiting. But instead of spending his final days in Baghdad celebrating and saying good-bye to family, Munther was in a panic. President Donald Trump was about to sign an executive order that would ban immigration from seven majority-Muslim countries for 120 days, including Iraq. Munther - a 37 year old chemical engineer and former translator for the US military - decided they couldn't wait. He told his family they were leaving Baghdad for the US immediately. His wife Hiba protested - she hadn't finished packing, and her grandfather was about to have emergency surgery for cancer. She wanted to see him before they left. It was only four days, she told him. ""I don't think we have even one day,"" Munther said. After hastily selling off the last of their furniture and some jewellery, Munther was able to raise the $5,000 (Â£4,022.50) needed for the next-day flight to Houston, with a connection through Istanbul, Turkey. The couple crammed the last of their possessions into gigantic roller suitcases, and told their distraught family members there'd been a drastic change of plans. Baghdad As his family slept, Munther flipped anxiously between CNN, Fox News and the BBC. It was just past midnight in Iraq, but in the US, it was still Friday afternoon. Munther watched President Trump at the Pentagon signing an executive order titled ""Protecting the Nation From Foreign Terrorist Entry Into the United States"". ""I am establishing new vetting measures to keep radical Islamic terrorists out of the United States of America. We don't want them here,"" Trump said before placing his pen on the paper. ""We want to ensure that we are not admitting into our country the very threats our soldiers are fighting overseas. We only want to admit those into our country who will support our country and love deeply our people."" Munther believed that he firmly belonged in the latter category. He'd always been fascinated by America, learning English from watching action movies like Rambo and The Terminator, and listening to Metallica as a teenager. Munther in 2008 after an Iraqi national football team win He stunned a group of Marines with his knowledge of American heavy metal after he met them at a checkpoint near a relative's home in Baghdad, back in 2003. At the time, he was still a student at the University of Technology, Iraq. ""You speak good English,"" the Marines told him. ""Why don't you join us?"" Munther saw it as an opportunity to rebuild his country in the then-hopeful, post-Saddam Hussein era Iraq. ""I wanted to help the American army and the Iraqi people to understand each other. I was trying to help both of them,"" he said. ""It was the right thing to do."" After the Marines left, Munther got a succession of jobs translating for the 3rd Infantry Division and 1st Armored Division. He was sent to the outskirts of Baghdad to help train the Iraqi National Guard. He manned the checkpoints. He had his own service weapon. He developed a reputation for his punctuality and his sunny disposition. One former soldier described him to the BBC as a ""critical asset"", trustworthy with unflinching ""integrity and morals"". The most dangerous assignment was with a unit clearing roadside bombs. His convoy was hit more than once. Fellow translators were getting killed or losing limbs. They were also getting murdered by members of al-Qaeda. ""They burned them alive. They cut their heads,"" Alaskry recalled. ""In Arabic we say, 'You are putting your spirit on the palm of your hand.' Because you don't know what will happen next."" One day, Alaskry found a letter on his car telling him that he would burn in hell for working for the ""infidels"". He fled for Jordan without telling anyone, but returned to Iraq a few years later to once again work for the Americans on a health care project for the United States Agency for International Development (USAID). In 2008, Munther married Hiba, also a chemical engineer. When their daughter Dima was born the following year, Munther realized that his young family had no future in Iraq. He was a marked man, and life in Baghdad was too unstable. The family had to move every year to keep their whereabouts a secret. When American troops began pulling out for good in 2011, Munther felt abandoned, like a trap was closing in on him - a feeling that followed him for years. Hiba and Munther in Erbil ""Everyday they are bombing us. Almost everyday, we have like a car bomb,"" he said. ""It's not safe over here, especially [after] working with the Americans."" In 2010, Munther applied for a Special Immigrant Visa, reserved for Iraqis and Afghans who served with the US military and could prove their lives were under threatened as a result. The programme was choked with applicants desperate to get out of the country. Delays mounted, as did the costs for doctor's exams and certificates from the local police ensuring Munther had no criminal record. Several American law enforcement agencies had to complete independent background checks on the family. Finally, in December 2016, they were cleared. Their tickets were booked. ""We said, 'There will be a light at the end of the tunnel. We will go to the states. We will secure a better life for our kids."" Baghdadto Istanbul In the early morning darkness, Munther and Hiba loaded their enormous bags and two sleepy children into a relative's car and left for the Baghdad airport. It was the middle of the night in the US. Trump's order, now eight hours old, had not been uploaded to the White House website. As the family checked in, no one questioned their visas or their Iraqi passports. As they waited for their first flight from Baghdad to Istanbul, Munther dashed off texts to his sponsors and former colleagues from USAID. He sent an email to his contacts at No One Left Behind, a non-profit in Washington founded by American soldiers to help translators resettle in the US. ""I'm so scared ... I don't know what we will face and I don't know if the officer at Istanbul will let us board on the Airplane,"" he wrote in one message. ""Right now the only feeling i have is fear. ""Please pray for us."" The three-hour flight to Istanbul was unbearable. Munther quaked in his seat. It was, he said, ""just like a horror movie - when you dream you're jumping from a high building"". In Istanbul, the family transferred to the plane to Houston without incident. After they took their seats, Munther put on cartoons for three year old Hassan. His daughter Dima, an exuberant, chatty seven year old, threw her arms around her father's neck, proclaiming this to be the best airplane she'd ever seen. Munther started to relax. He reminded Dima of his promise to take her to Disney Land, a treat for which she'd been saving her pocket money. About 15 minutes after they boarded, a Turkish police officer made her way down the aisle, followed by three uniformed airport security officers. They stopped at Hiba's seat. ""Madame, your passport please,"" the officer said. At that moment, Munther says, ""I knew our dream was lost"". The heap of luggage in the Alaskrys' apartment after the failed attempt to migrate to the US Baghdad After they were pulled from the Turkish flight - the children crying as they were ejected onto the tarmac in the snow - the Alaskrys spent 13 hours in the Turkish airport waiting for a flight back to Baghdad. Hiba and Munther took turns sleeping in order to keep watch over their bags. By then, news of the executive order had reached airlines and customs officials abroad, and travellers from Syria, Sudan, Iran, Iraq, Libya, Yemen and Somalia were being pulled from their seats or barred at the gates at airports all over the world. In New York City, flights that had been in the air when Trump signed his order had touched down, and US Customs and Border Patrol officers were beginning to hold anyone from the seven barred countries. Some people were sent back. Some signed documents presented to them that cancelled their visas. Even permanent residents - green card holders - were being told they could not return to their homes in the US. One of the first Iraqis to be stopped at John F Kennedy International Airport was a man called Hameed Khalid Darweesh, who had come to the US on the same type of visa Munther was carrying: an SIV, which he earned after interpreting for the US military for 10 years. People gather for a protest at Terminal 4 of the John F Kennedy airport in New York on 28 January Over the course of the day more and more reports of detainees at airports around the country began to come in: at San Francisco International, Dulles International in Washington, and Philadelphia International Airport. As the news spread, demonstrators began showing up to the terminals. Darweesh was eventually released, and a challenge filed in court on his behalf resulted in a US District Court judge ordering a stop to all deportations for visa-holders from the seven countries. Green card-holders were allowed into the country, in some cases after long, intense interviews by customs officials. Lawyers in Virginia, then Massachusetts, then Washington state and Minnesota filed various motions to block Trump's executive order. Munther watched the protests swelling at JFK on television from their nearly empty house in Baghdad, their carefully packed bags now strewn in a heap across the floor. ""It was amazing,"" he said. ""Lawyers go voluntarily to help the refugees, to help the immigrants, to help the kids. I was feeling happy because other people could make it. ""American people are great people. Really. I work with them. I know them."" Before they left, Munther sold their car and almost all their furniture. He quit his job and had turned down other offers of employment. Because they missed their flight, the resettlement agency in Houston had to give their apartment away. There would be no refund for the aborted trip, nor for the return flight to Baghdad. In an upstairs bedroom, Munther flipped through a stack of his old identification badges. His weapons authorisation card, his translator's badge, a pass to former Iraqi president Saddam Hussein's palace, refashioned as a US military base named FOB Prosperity. Munther Alaskry said working with the US military was ""the right thing to do"" He had a stack of photographs of himself standing with American soldiers - playing cards, riding on top of a tank, posing with an M-16 rifle. The younger Munther looks giddy in the photos. ""They were like my brothers, you know?"" he said. ""They're really nice guys. Really nice."" Munther pulled out another folder stuffed with letters of commendation, certificates of appreciation, and other documentation of his work history. ""Thank you for your hard work and exceptional performance,"" read one. ""We couldn't do it without you!"" said another. ""Another one. Another one,"" Munther said, flipping faster and faster, then throwing the whole pile on a heap on his bathroom counter. ""Even if I have thousands of those, it's now worth nothing, you know?"" Trump's executive order halted all immigration from Iraq for 120 days. The Alaskrys' visas were due to expire in just two months, at which point they'd be back where they started in 2010. Munther didn't believe they would ever come to the US, at least not while Trump was president. ""Losing a job, losing money, it's OK. You can survive,"" he said, ""But losing your dreams? This is the most terrible thing."" Washington After three days of chaos, confusion, and a blizzard of legal challenges from all over the country, a press conference was called in Washington with the heads of Homeland Security, US Customs and Border Protection and US Immigration and Customs Enforcement. ""This is not, I repeat, not a ban on Muslims,"" said Secretary of Homeland Security John Kelly. But Kevin McAleenan, acting commissioner of US Customs and Border Protection, did have an important clarification to make. ""Lawful permanent residents and Special Immigrant Visa holders are allowed to board their flights,"" he said. The state department later confirmed that ""it is in the national interest to allow Iraqi Special Immigrant Visa (SIV) holders to continue to travel to the United States."" This video can not be played President Trump's travel ban court battle explained Soon after, the founder of No One Left Behind posted a victory message on the group's Facebook page and sent messages to all of their clients abroad, including Munther: ""GREAT NEWS! Afghan and Iraq SIVs WILL be allowed to enter America!! We did it!!!"" Baghdad In his empty apartment, Munther watched McAleenan's comments. He checked the US Embassy's website and read the new guidance. Finally, after a representative from the embassy called and confirmed that he and his family would indeed be able to travel, Munther once again booked a flight to the US. But almost as soon as the tickets were purchased - this time flying through Doha, Qatar, to New York City - dread set in. ""First I was happy, but now I'm scared,"" he said. ""I don't want my wife and kids to face the same situation. ""Oh my god, I cannot handle it. I barely handled it last time."" As they packed their bags once again, it was clear that little Dima was still traumatised by her experience in Turkey. She asked her mother to bring blankets so that when they were kicked off the flight and forced to spend another night in the airport, she would have something to cover herself with. ""I don't want to go to the America because they don't want us to go,"" she told her father. Munther tried to reassure her, but he wasn't feeling very sure himself. ""Hopefully everything will be just fine,"" he repeated over and over. ""Fingers crossed."" Munther and family waiting for their fight to New York City in Doha Baghdad After a sleepless night, Munther lined up the suitcases once more at the front door of their home and called Qatar Airlines to make sure they would be able to board their flight. He was told no. No-one at the airline had heard of the new guidance. In a panic, Munther called the US Embassy in Baghdad, which referred him to an emergency hotline and emailed him the text of the new rule to show airport officials. The airline employees were unimpressed. Munther continued sending frantic emails and texts to the US Embassy all the way to the airport. Finally, about an hour before the flight was set to take off, Munther got a call from Qatar Airlines. ""Do you want to hear some good news?"" the man asked him. The family was cleared, and allowed through security with just 30 minutes to make it to their gate. After a sprint through the airport, they arrived just in time for their flight to Doha. It was at this point that Munther finally broke down. ""I don't know how to describe how I'm feeling right now,"" he said, tearing up. ""Finally. It was a struggle. But finally."" New York City The flight from Doha touched down at John F Kennedy International Airport at 8:30am, and a small group of lawyers, a local rabbi and a volunteer chauffer waited by customs for the Alaskrys. Ayla Yavin volunteered through her synagogue to drive the Alaskrys to their hotel An hour passed, then two. All of the Doha flight passengers came and went with no sign of the family. ""This is worrying,"" said Emad Khalil, a lawyer from the newly formed group No Ban JFK. He started making phone calls to the American Civil Liberties Union, who in turn began calling the border patrol and airport officials. After three hours, Khalil was certain that the family was being detained somewhere behind the big, white wall that separated customs from arrivals. If they did not appear soon, the lawyers said they would file a legal motion on behalf of the family. Finally, after five anxious hours, they finally emerged, Dima and Hassan holding hands, Hiba and Munther smiling from behind a roller cart stacked high with luggage. Despite the lengthy delay, Hiba said that the customs officials who interviewed them were friendly, and they never felt intimidated. Hassan, Dima and Munther Alaskry emerged from customs five hours after their flight landed One woman handed Dima and Hassan drawings from her own children that read, ""Welcome to New York!"" Dima chattered away about her plans to see Frozen's Elsa at Disney Land. ""I like it so much - it's so cute,"" she enthused about the bland, sterile airport terminal. Like her father, she also learned English in part from watching movies. ""She would like to be famous,"" said Hiba, smiling. ""She has a very strong personality."" At the hotel, the family was greeted by two women from No One Left Behind. They brought a basket filled with Legos, Play-Doh, blocks, a fashion drawing kit for Dima. The children unpacked and re-packed the basket over and over again, counting their new bounty. Finally, the Alaskrys were left alone to ascend to their 15th floor room, overlooking the rooftop gardens of the Upper East Side. The children ripped open packets of mini Chips Ahoy cookies, and Dima devoured her first Pop-Tart. They scurried from one end of the room to the other. No one seemed ready for a nap, though they'd been up for nearly two days. Dima digs into a blueberry Pop-Tart, a treat left in the hotel room by members of No One Left Behind The upshot of the cancelled flight to Houston was an unexpected three-day vacation in New York City, thanks to a relative who paid for their hotel as a gift. Sitting on the plush, crisp bedspread, Munther was in disbelief. ""I've been hearing songs about New York, I've been watching New York like from the American movies,"" he said. ""You see like the yellow taxi of New York, the pizza of New York - it's amazing."" The Alaskrys' new, final destination was Rochester, New York, about five hours north of the city, where a host family and a group of about 40 volunteers waited to help them navigate their new lives in the US. But before all of that, Munther said he was taking his children to the Statue of Liberty. ""Now they are in the best country in the world, in my opinion,"" he said. ""This is my dream, to bring my kids here, now. After like, maybe ten years, 20 years, I'll be able to tell my kids, 'Listen, you were in Baghdad in that situation, I brought you all the way, I did all these sacrifices for you, and you are here now.'

Grown-up chats,"June Lord, 82, is one of those helped home from hospital under the Wakefield project Every Monday morning, in a meeting room within earshot of the bells of Wakefield cathedral, a group of healthcare workers help to stage a mini-revolution. Nothing that you read in the next few minutes may strike you as particularly surprising. Yet the experimental manner in which they are working together in this corner of Yorkshire is being seen as a possible way to improve healthcare across the country, and save the NHS money. At the table is a healthcare assistant, called Kay, Karen the physiotherapist, then Jane the occupational therapist. On the other side sit two mental health nurses both called Rachel, and finally Sue Robson - another mental health nurse who's been with the NHS for 37 years. ""I've seen many, many changes, and this is one of the most exciting,"" smiles Sue. Each Monday, they sit together and plan the care that will be offered to the mostly elderly people they are working with in a number of care homes in the Wakefield district. Because each here brings a different specialism to the table, they can, as a group, build up a complete picture of how best to help each patient. There is one woman they are especially worried about this week. She has fallen quite a few times, but as they talk it begins to look less like a purely physical problem. ""I carried out a physio session last week,"" says Karen. She was ""very anxious. It was difficult to engage with her,"" adds Kay. ""So today if things don't seem to be improving we may look at discussing with the psychiatrist whether she needs a review,"" concludes Sue. ""As professionals we are linking up,"" Sue continues. ""We're discussing the case between ourselves. We have links to the GP. We have links to the mental health services and we are all working together rather than in isolation."" ""We've seen some good results."" Mental health nurse Sue Robson says they have seen good results in Wakefield Across the board this project in Wakefield - which at its most basic aims to get the different parts of the health service and the care system working together - is easing the pressures on the NHS and on care homes. They have seen a sizable reduction in the number of patients who've had to go to hospital from the care homes they work in. A reduction in the use of ambulances. A reduction in the number of days patients who do go to hospital end up spending in a hospital bed. It's both about keeping patients out of hospital in the first place, and getting them home as quickly as possible if they do need to go. In the first nine months of 2016-17, phase one of the Wakefield Vanguard Care Homes scheme recorded: 19% reduction in emergency admissions 12% reduction A&E attendances 9% reduction in ambulance call-outs 26% reduction in bed days Source: Wakefield Clinical Commissioning Group The project has involved NHS workers training up care home staff beyond the basic first aid most already have. That gives care homes the skills they need to better diagnose what is wrong with a resident who falls ill. It is resulting in better care for patients and fewer 999 calls for an ambulance. There are also efforts to improve people's health in the first place. A lot of work is going into making the men and women who live in care homes and ""independent living"" flats (they used to be known as sheltered accommodation) feel less isolated. Sharon Carter runs one project that aims to stop the elderly feeling lonely. It's called Portrait of a Life. Essentially it's a photo and memory book that residents like 91-year-old Marjorie Smith receive. Marjorie Smith is a resident at the Croftlands independent living scheme It helps them reminisce, it helps other older people living in the same accommodation get to know their neighbours, and it helps care staff learn about what makes the people in their care tick. ""We're finding they have a better sense of well-being as opposed to ill-being,"" says Sharon. Along with everything else the project is doing, she says it's led to fewer people going into hospital and residential care. Many of course still do end up in hospital. And when they do Louise Lumley works at the ""getting them home"" end of the process. She's part of Age UK's Wakefield District team, and outside Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield she's securing 82-year-old June Lord's wheelchair in the back of an adapted car. It will be a 20-minute journey home. When they arrive, Louise goes through a list of questions. Does June have someone who can help her in the coming days? Does she have the medicine she needs? Is there anything at home that's particularly dangerous that might need to be made safe, to prevent future injuries? The answers will go into a database that can help tailor June's care in the coming months. A week of coverage by BBC News examining the state of the NHS across the UK as it comes under intense pressure during its busiest time of the year. Video: What happens when a hospital clogs up Voices from NHS frontline Iris Sibley's long wait to leave hospital There is plenty of other work besides. A local not-for-profit Housing Association sits in meetings with health staff to work out how best to improve the lives of the elderly people who rent flats from them. They're trying to join up all the parts of the system as much as they can. Everyone here stresses it's about improving patient care. But there are savings to be made. They estimate that if they roll this project out across the whole district, by 2021 they will make a net saving of Â£5.3m a year.

Georgia's rise fans Six Nations debate,"This video can not be played Should Georgia be in the Six Nations? Six Nations: Round 2 Dates:11-12 FebCoverage:Live across BBC One, BBC Radio 5 live, BBC Red Button, Connected TV and online.(full coverage details) Worcester Warriors are the epitome of a modern, professional rugby union club. In a purpose built stadium, near a motorway, players from a dozen different nations train on an artificial pitch so new it uses the very latest organic infill (carbon neutral, derived from defibration of woody plants, according to the Italian manufacturer). Between the New Zealanders, South Africans, Pacific Islanders and Englishmen there is Jaba Bregvadze. He is a Georgian rugby player. A hooker with 40 caps for his country and club career which took him to one of Europe's most famous sides, Toulouse, before Worcester. But his rugby education was in Tblisi and he knows exactly what the sport means to Georgia. ''The tradition of Georgians is physical. Unfortunately, we had a lot of wars. Rugby is the same, like war. You are playing against someone, maybe he is your friend but for 80 minutes he is your enemy,"" he says. ""You must hurt him, but not give penalties, there are some rules (he laughs). I think this is the Georgian tradition. That's why the scrum is easier for us, driving the mauls is easier for us, we are playing with the heart, with big heart but everyone knows our skills are not in the top, that is the Georgian tradition.'' This video can not be played Six Nations Remix: Schoolboys and 'Salt Bae' That ethos sits with the legend of Lelo - a Georgian folk sport which is the source of the national team's nickname - which pitted village against village battling over a ball in a field. Georgia has a unique version of rugby history. The problem, though, is the future. How to develop those missing skills? Results suggest Georgia have outgrown their status. They've won the European Nations Cup - the Six Nations 'B' competition, now renamed theRugby Europe Championship,external- for each of the past six seasons. At the last World Cup they won two games and defended bravely indefeat against New Zealand.As the Six Nations began they were officially world ranked 12th, that's one place above Italy. Promotion to - and relegation from - the Six Nations has been ruled out by chief executive John Feehan, at least in the near future. In reality Georgia are well aware of that position, and as much as they would like to be in the tournament they have another idea. The head of operations at Georgia's Rugby Union told BBC Sport he would like to see a ""show match"" between the bottom-placed team in the Six Nations and the Rugby Europe winner. That team, for almost all of the past decade, has been Georgia. The Georgians suggest this match would take place on a neutral venue. It would not be a promotion relegation game. Just a match that - as Georgia puts it - ""really can attract big interest"". 'Angry man Brown on his 'passion for England' Preparation time 'no excuse' for Wales Comparing England with All Black is fair - Warburton Scotland have a Lion on Hogg - Guscott It was a suggestion I put to John Feehan, the Six Nations chief executive. ''I'm sure it would be interesting but we've got to look at it from the integrity of our competition and what's good for us and not necessarily what's good for Georgia,"" he told BBC Sport. ""And I don't mean that in any nasty way - other than to say that my role is to make sure that the six unions which are involved in the Six Nations maintain the credibility of the tournament. And a game like that could involve all sorts of speculation that wouldn't necessarily be helpful.'' Since they joined in 2000, Italy have finished bottom of the Six Nations table on 11 occasions - and they werewell beaten at home by Walesin their opening game in this year's championship. But in individual matches they have beaten all the other nations teams, apart from England. Mr Feehan's standpoint is to support Italy's status in the competition. But he does admit to some disappointment. ''Have Italy progressed as much as we'd like? Probably not,"" he said. ""But the reality is; it's very hard. And part of that is that everybody else's standards have improved as well. It's not like the others have stood still and Italy hasn't. Italy have developed and made progress, but it's a relative progress, if you like. ""Are they going to catch up? Of course they are. And they are in the process of doing that and [new Italy boss] Conor O'Shea's going to be a very important part of that happening.'' This video can not be played Highlights: Scotland 43-16 Georgia This will be O'Shea's first Six Nations tournament in charge of Italy. He comes with a strong reputation in the game, both as a player for Ireland and a coach in English club rugby. He understands there is a need for developing nations to have some meaningful incentive. He told me: ''We can't let Italian rugby wither - Italian rugby needs to be supported - we need the extra investment in Italian rugby because Italian rugby has a history and a tradition, like Romanian rugby, if you think back to the 1970s in Romania [when they were beating the likes of France]. So we have to nurture all teams, all nations. ""I look around at the young players and the youth system in Italian rugby - there are more players in Italy than there are in Wales - lots of young players. Do you want to lose that? No, you don't, you have to incentivise it. ""Do we expand? Do we have another system? But by the time those decisions are made be careful what you wish for, because it might not be Italy who are bottom of the pile.'' Georgia - here scoring against New Zealand at the 2015 World Cup through Beka Tsiklauri - have qualified automatically for the 2019 edition in Japan Later this year Georgia will host the under-20's World Cup for the first time. Jaba Bregvadze believes interest in the sport there has grown significantly. Games against Russia - which carry enormous political and cultural significance - attract sell-out crowds of 50,000 in Tblisi. But Bregvadze says tens of thousands of fans are now coming to watch them play other sides too. ''At the weekend there is not too much happening at Georgia. When you are winning a game at the weekend, the people are coming, it's like a positive atmosphere,"" he said. ""The people are hearing something new; the Georgia team wins by 20 points or 40 points or five points, it doesn't matter. I think they're getting proud of their team and happy. I think it's a big thing for the whole country.'' In November 2016, Georgia played Scotland in Kilmarnock andwere well beaten 43-16.But Bregvadze desperately wants more exposure to these kind of games. ''It would be great if we had the chance to play in the Six Nations but the most important thing for us is to play as much against the good teams, the better teams than we are, because if you want to grow as a team, you need to play against better teams than you are.'' The Georgian rugby union has suggested to BBC Sport that, if they are barred from the Six Nations indefinitely, they will be ""looking to participate in other competitions as a franchise, whatever chance there will be we will explore this possibility"". The prospect of relegation adds a crucial dimension to many sporting competitions, it is exactly the fate Worcester are trying desperately to avoid in English rugby's Premiership this season. The Six Nations may have ruled it out, for now. But if Georgia keep winning, if their crowds keep coming and if their players keep being hired in England and France then their presence will remain whilst the Six Nations carries on without them.

Jamie Robertson: Why carmakers fear protectionism,"The Dodge Ram 1500 - made in the USA? Not entirely Few places have ""Made in America"" written all over them like the Warren Truck Assembly Plant. They have been making trucks at the factory, outside Detroit, since 1938, and you don't get much more American than the chunky, no-nonsense, big-tyred Dodge Ram 1500s that roll out from the 87-acre site every day. So if I want to buy American, surely I can do no better than buy a Ram? Well, no. Actually you'd be better off buying a Honda. The Kogod School of Business at American University in Washington DC compilesan annual index,externalof the cars Americans drive - and where they are made. The Dodge Ram 1500 turns out, according to this index, to be only 59.5% made in America. The Honda Accord, says Kogod, is 81% American. Now this is partly because some of the Ram 1500s are made not in Detroit at all, but in Saltillo, Mexico. And then there is the fiendishly complicated issue of components. The Honda Accord is 81% American, according to the Kogod School of Business Fiat Chrysler Automobiles (FCA), which makes the Ram, has a huge supplier network that buys in parts and manufacturing from around the world from Cordoba in Argentina to Serbia and South Korea. It's not just FCA, globalisation is in the lifeblood of the car industry, and its supply lines have become possibly the most complex and finely tuned of any business on the planet. Now this model is under threat. In the US, President Trump has pledged to hike tariffs on US cars made abroad, or as he succinctlytweeted,external: ""Make in U.S.A. or pay big border tax!"" This, he believes, will save American jobs. Mr Trump may well have caught hold of a global zeitgeist. Before the US election, the World Trade Organization (WTO) reported a spike in trade-restrictive measures imposed by members, averaging 22 per month, the highest since 2011. ""In the current environment, a rise in trade restrictions is the last thing the global economy needs,"" director-general Roberto Azevedo said. Trump: Protectionism by tweeting But the carmakers appear to be buckling under, and scrambling to polish up their Made in America badges. Ford, for instance,scrapped a plan to build a plant in Mexicoand gottweeted a pat on the back,externalfrom the president. Despite the hype, Ford's decision to build in Michigan is a minor tweak in its global strategy. But if border taxes on car imports work their way from angry tweets to real legislation, the global motor industry is in trouble. One firm ignoring President Trump's criticism is German car giant BMW, who recently announced plans to retool its factory north of Pretoria in South Africa to produce the X3 sport-utility vehicle outside the US for the first time. BMW is also building another Mexican plant in San Luis Potosi. Ian Robertson, head of sales and marketing at BMW, points out that its Spartanburg plant in South Carolina in the US is the biggest of all its factories, and says its decision to build the San Luis Potosi plant simply reflects how the industry works. ""This is part of the normal business development of a company like BMW which has nearly 30 production facilities in 14 countries. And the Mexican investment is one in a plant which will produce a capacity that will ultimately supply many markets."" In the UK, the making and selling of cars is similarly global. Last year, which was not untypical, the majority of cars made in the UK were exported, while most of those sold (86%) were imported. Few UK politicians are making Trump-like calls for protectionism, but if the Brexit process ends up with the country pulling out of the EU single market,as Prime Minister Theresa May has indicated, it could still lead to tariffs on imports and exports, and hobble the car industry's cross-border supply chains and sales. ""Year-on-year exports have driven the car industry, and with so much content sourced internationally, we are massively dependent on zero tariffs and a customs union,"" says Tamzen Isacsson, communications and international director at the Society of Motor Manufacturers and Traders (SMMT). If tariffs based on WTO rules were applied to cross-border car and car part sales, the SMMT estimates the price of an average imported car would rise by Â£1,500, while overall costs would rise by at least Â£4.5bn ($5.6bn) a year. But possible tariffs are not the only problem. UK car production is globally integrated Modern car manufacturing is built around just-in-time manufacturing (JIT), developed over the last 60 years under various names like ""lean manufacturing"" and ""quality circles"". They all have the same core purpose - to minimise waste by keeping inventory at very low levels, alerting suppliers at exactly the point when new parts are needed. The flipside of JIT is that a delay can wreak havoc on the whole operation. When a fire closed the Channel Tunnel in 2015, UK car plants, starved for just a few hours of their supplies,were forced to hire private jets,externalto intercept trucks en route to the UK to make sure components arrived on time. ""Many manufacturers carry stock to last them no more than four hours, so they are utterly dependent on rapid, fast-flowing content from the EU,"" says Ms Isacsson. ""If you have delays with tariffs and cross-border checks the costs mount up and in an intensely competitive environment you suddenly find you cannot compete."" While the possibility of doing a free trade deal with the EU for the car industry would keep the wheels of trade turning, identifying which imports and exports were for the car industry and which weren't would be difficult. ""It would be easy to identify an engine, a turbo-charger, but we also buy in steel, we buy chemicals, we buy glass, we buy engine control units. How would you be sure that those particular products are going to go into the automotive sector, rather than another sector?,"" says SMMT chief executive Mike Hawes. Ultimately, unwinding the labyrinthine supply chain of the car industry to work out what to tax and where could prove the biggest deterrent to new tariffs.

His word against hers?,"After the infamous 2012 gang rape of a student on a bus in Delhi, the number of rape cases reported to police in India rose sharply. But one survey concluded that in Delhi, in 2013-14, more than half of these reports were ""false"" - fuelling claims by male activists that women are alleging rape in order to extort money from men. Yogesh Gupta always knew he had evidence that could prove, indisputably, he was not a rapist, but getting the police to recognise his innocence was another matter. The 44-year-old Delhi estate agent's troubles began after he caught an employee embezzling money and threatened to go to the police. The employee reacted by coercing a woman to pose as a potential house buyer who, after viewing a property, asked Gupta for a lift to the local metro station. She later accused him of driving her to an empty fourth floor apartment and raping her. ""Thankfully I had CCTV installed in my office,"" he says. ""The whole process of taking the stairs to the fourth floor, opening the flat, taking her inside, then getting out and dropping her at the metro station would have taken at least 37 - 40 minutes. ""I could prove I was back in my office within 11 minutes."" But when the woman registered her complaint to the police, Gupta found himself caught up in a system that seemed to care little about the evidence and a lot about branding him a criminal. ""Nobody listened to what I had to say,"" he says. ""The police didn't even consult me. I tried everything, but I didn't get justice."" The gang-rape and murder of a student in Delhi in 2012 provoked mass protests For the next eight months as the police investigation continued, Gupta had to endure the public disgrace of being accused of rape. ""I can't even begin to explain the ordeal that my wife, kids, my father and brother had to go through,"" he says. ""My children have had the toughest time. My daughter, who is just six years old, would write letters to god pleading to spare her father."" When the case finally went to court, the woman confessed she had made up the accusation and Gupta was acquitted, but much damage had already been done. Lawyer Vinay Sharma says he defends many clients who have been falsely accused Gupta sees himself as a victim of what men's rights campaigners say is a growing problem - the false allegations of rape - and it's one that some argue stems directly from the 2012 Delhi gang rape. As graphic details of the brutal attack were made public, protesters took to the streets to demand changes to India's deeply patriarchal society which they said ignores or even encourages violence against women. The media responded with a spike in reports of sexual assault, particularly violent assaults by strangers, and the government widened the definition of rape, made it mandatory for police to register all complaints and introduced special fast-track courts. This in turn encouraged more women to report sexual violence, with the number of cases registered in Delhi rising by more than 100% in the year after the 2012 gang-rape. All these developments were widely welcomed as positive steps to tackle sexual violence. But when a body called the Delhi Commission for Women published a report in 2014 describing 53% of rapes reported in the city the previous year as ""false"" this was seized upon by men's rights activists as evidence that the legal changes and noisy public debate had ended up making victims out of men. ""Of all the rape cases that are registered, only 1% is genuine,"" says Gupta's lawyer, Vinay Sharma, who regularly defends men accused of rape in Delhi. ""The rest are either registered to take revenge or to take advantage of the person in some financial matter,"" he says. Men's rights activist Partha Sadhukhan takes a similar view. ""The reality at that point in time was that India had enough stringent laws to curb rape and punish the offenders,"" he says. ""Today the definition of rape has changed so much and anything and everything is reported as rape."" But are they right? The evidence from the Commission for Women is in fact far from conclusive. It classes as ""false"" all reports of rape that were dropped before they reached court, without analysing the reasons why. So it doesn't distinguish between cases dropped because it was clear the woman was lying and those where a woman was put under pressure to withdraw her claim - or where there was simply insufficient evidence to build a strong case. Forensic evidence is rarely used in Indian rape cases, so it's often just his word against hers. One person who decided to do her own investigation was data journalist Rukmini Shrinivasan. When she moved to Delhi from Mumbai to take up a post at The Hindu newspaper, she wanted to know whether Delhi's reputation as the rape capital of India was justified. Instead of counting dropped rape cases, she looked at the 460 cases that went to a full trial in Delhi district courts in 2013 and compared the initial complaint made to  police with what happened in court. Her first discovery was that the media's alarm about stranger rape was overblown. ""Stranger rape, the thing that gets most highly reported in India, was an absolutely tiny category,"" she says. It accounted for just 12 of the 460 cases. On the question of false rape, her findings were mixed. More than one third of the 460 cases involved young people who had engaged in consensual sex outside marriage until their parents found out and used the criminal justice system to end the relationship. ""Families are more willing to have the stigma of rape rather than having the stigma of their daughter choosing her own sex or life partner,"" she says. Shrinivasan found that many of these cases dealt with inter-caste or mixed-religion relationships which are considered taboo in conservative society. There was often a typical script that was used when parents filed the case with the police. ""I was repeatedly seeing stories of women being picked up in moving cars, being given a cold drink laced with sedatives which would render them unconscious, and then they would be raped,"" she said. ""But when I started reading more and more cases I realised that there are patterns to how complaints are filed. So this sedative-laced drink becomes important because it is necessary to show that consent was not given."" Another large category - nearly a quarter of the total - were cases where the man had broken his promise to marry the woman. Although this would not be considered rape in many countries, in India a man can be charged with falsely obtaining consent for sex if he promises to marry a woman and then changes his mind. ""The parents say, 'You've lost your virginity, it's going to be impossible to get you married, you file this case, he'll get scared and he'll marry you,'"" says Shrinivasan. What she did not find was any cases like Yogesh Gupta's, where a woman had filed a case maliciously or to extort money. ""In some cases it would be the argument of the defence that the woman was trying to abstract money,"" she says. ""But I cannot think of a case where this was proven."" While Shrinivasan's study would appear to indicate that the proportion of false rape cases in Delhi is high by international standards - in more than one country, researchers have put the proportion of false rape claims at about 8% of the total - academic Nithya Nagarathinam argues that this is a distraction from a more pressing issue, the under-reporting of rape. ""Although there has been a jump in rape reporting since the Delhi gang-rape, there are still many cases that go unreported and there are so many reasons for that,"" she says, pointing to traditional patriarchal structures that mean violence against women is consistently downplayed. ""That is a more serious issue to me than a few cases where the parents have probably wrongly accused the man."" Nagarathinam cites a 2014 study using data from the Indian National Crime Records Bureau and the National Family Health Surveys that suggests only 6% of incidents of sexual violence against women are reported to the police.

Anna Holligan: Why Geert Wilders is scenting victory,"Almere began as a city in 1976 and now has 200,000 residents When Dutch populist Geert Wilders promises to stop Islam and make the Netherlands great again, his message finds a ready audience in the country's newest city of Almere. ""It's too easy for people to come here,"" says Joost, a 60-year-old market trader. ""Too many guys from Turkey and Morocco, economic migrants. I have three small children, what kind of world will they grow up in?"" Dutch voters go to the polls on 15 March and Mr Wilders' Freedom Party (PVV) may win the biggest number of seats. Almere means ""all lake"", which it was until the 1960s. Then it became a concrete conurbation with affordable homes for people leaving Amsterdam. For several years it has been Geert Wilders territory. Immigrants now make up about 30% of the population and that ethnic diversity is reflected at the market, where you can find steaming bowls of spicy Surinamese brown beans and headscarves displayed in rainbow fashion. Behind a thick rack of winter jackets, a woman with dyed-blond hair backs the UK's decision to leave the EU and says the Dutch should do the same. Ria also complains about a Muslim neighbour. ""At New Year I tried to shake his hand and he said he didn't shake hands with non-Muslim women."" Often described as the Dutch Donald Trump, Mr Wilders shares the US president's opposition to Muslim immigration, his distrust of the media and his love of Twitter. He sparked a ""fake news"" row on Tuesday by tweeting a photo-shopped picture of a liberal political rival surrounded by radical Islamists, and then accused him of being a ""drama queen"" when he objected. But watching Mr Wilders praise Mr Trump's policies has made Ria change her mind about voting for him: ""When Trump brought in the travel ban and Wilders said 'Oh yeah we must do that in Holland too', I thought, no, he's crazy, that's not the way."" Geert Wilders was convicted of incitement by a Dutch court last year ""De-Islamising the Netherlands"" - no more immigrants or asylum seekers from Muslim countries No Islamic headscarves in public functions; ban on Islamic expressions that violate public order Ban on Koran, closure of mosques and Islamic schools Dutch exit from EU Deport criminals with dual nationality Lower income tax, pension age at 65, roll back cuts in elderly care, home care Are the Dutch really turning to Wilders? Wilders guilty of incitement Opinion polls suggest support for a Dutch ""Nexit"" in the months after the Brexit vote fell by 8% to 25%. Pollsters say people have realised that leaving the EU would be more complicated than they thought. ""If you sell to other countries and we're not in the EU anymore it's difficult,"" says Richard as he sells slabs of Edam cheese. With the financial crisis over in the Netherlands, the economy is growing and has faded as an election issue. Instead, immigration is expected to dominate the campaign. The pragmatic prime minister, Mark Rutte, launched his election campaign with an open letter warning that anyone who wasn't prepared to ""be normal"" and accept Dutch culture should get out of the country. Rights groups accused the prime minister of undermining the constitution. ""It's like PVV-light,"" says Anna Timmerman, director of Human Rights Watch in the Netherlands. Newspaper columnist Folkert Jensma is concerned his country is losing its ""moral compass"". ""In my opinion a politician should be very careful and try to keep telling the truth. Is their fear based in reality? If everyone heads off to la-la-land where everyone is scared, we all end up with a president like Donald Trump."" The Hague suburb of Duindorp is another Wilders stronghold, where 90% are white and 35% voted PVV at the last election. A few years ago, the low-rise red-brick flats here were daubed with racist graffiti including a swastika. ""It's an old fisherman's village. People feel like other people are moving on to their turf,"" says Linda, who surprised her friends and family by marrying a Muslim from Morocco called Mostafa. Mostafa (pictured with Linda) doubts the Dutch will back a proposal to deport repeat offenders The couple were so concerned about discrimination, they considered giving their son Linda's maiden name to protect him from prejudice. ""Groups don't mix. They're afraid of each other because they don't know each other."" Mostafa is in the Dutch army and believes his religion is perfectly compatible with Dutch culture, ""because if God, if Allah, did not want homosexuality to exist it would not exist"". He does not think Mr Wilders would be able to push through some of his policies. ""I am totally totally convinced that most of the people in the Netherlands are in their heart decent people."" Geert Wilders' party may well top the vote on 15 March but only his most ardent followers think he will become the next prime minister. The Dutch political system always produces a coalition government, and most other parties have vowed not to team up with him. But if his popularity encourages enough liberal politicians to adopt his signature policies, Mr Wilders may claim victory even without winning the election. Correction 8 March 2017: This story has been amended to clarify Mr Wilders' policy on elderly care. Are Dutch voters turning to populist Geert Wilders?

ELN peace talks: What are the challenges?,"The ELN is Colombia's second-largest rebel group The National Liberation Army (ELN), Colombia's second-largest rebel group, has entered into formal peace talks with Colombian government negotiators. The talks are aimed at ending more than five decades of armed conflict. Here, we take a closer look at the discussions ahead. In March 2016, government negotiator Frank Pearl and ELN rebel Antonio Garcia said they would engage in formal peace talks Yes, the ELN and the government first announced their intention to start formal peace talks at a news conference on 30 March 2016. They had originally been expected to start in May 2016, but did not go ahead. Later, the two sides said the negotiations would start in the Ecuadorean capital, Quito, on 27 October, but that date also came and went. A new date was set for 7 February 2017. The government said it would not start formal talks until the ELN released Odin Sanchez Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said that a precondition for the talks was the release of hostages the ELN was holding. The ELN has long used kidnapping for ransom as a means of financing itself. It also considers the kidnapping of soldiers and police officers a legitimate tactic. The rebels eventually agreed to free a soldier they had recently seized andformer Congressman Odin Sanchezin exchange for a pardon for two of its jailed members. The move finally paved the way for formal talks to start. However, future delays cannot be ruled out as the ELN has been reluctant to hurry the negotiations along. In an answer to an open letter by Colombian intellectuals asking the rebels to negotiate speedily, ELN leader Nicolas Rodriguez said that ""for the ELN, setting a deadline for peace means obstructing it"". The ELN claims that it is ""always close to the people"" President Santos has set his aims high. He says he wants to ""achieve complete peace"". The ELN says it also wants peace but Mr Rodriguez, better known as Gabino, says he does not want the negotiations just to be between the government and the ELN but for civil society to be involved, too. The six points on the agenda are currently rather vague. They are: Participation of civil society in peace building Democracy for peace Transformations for peace Victims End of the armed conflict Implementation The ELN has been fighting the Colombian state for more than five decades The group was founded in 1964 and follows a Marxist-Leninist ideology. It was inspired by the Cuban revolution of 1959 with an aim to fighting Colombia's unequal distribution of land and riches. It feels particularly strongly that the country's oil and mineral riches should be shared among its people rather than exploited by foreign multinationals. Over the decades, the guerrilla group has attacked large landholders and multinational companies. It has repeatedly blown up oil pipelines. In the talks, its representatives are likely to call for social change to achieve more equality and for the inclusion in politics of Colombians whose voices they say have gone unheard for too long. The ELN has fewer members than Colombia's largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) The ELN is believed to have fewer than 1,500 active fighters, according to intelligence reports seen by Colombian media. They are backed up by a larger number of ""militants"" or sympathisers who provide logistical support and back-up. Its strongholds are in rural areas in the north and on the border with Venezuela, and also in the provinces of Casanare, Norte de Santander and Cauca. The ELN is made up of regional commandos which have a certain degree of autonomy, which could make implementation of any deal hard to achieve. Peace talks held between 2002 and 2007 failed. The government said the ELN ""lacked commitment"" Both sides say they are completely committed to the negotiations succeeding. The government would like to see a deal signed before the presidential election in May 2018 but the ELN has said it will not be rushed. Observers of the peace process think the ELN may prove harder to negotiate with than Colombia's largest rebel group, the Farc, with whom the government signed a peace deal in November. That is because the ELN is less hierarchical in its structure and its members are believed to be more wedded to their Marxist ideology than the Farc. The ELN also has not yet sworn off kidnappings for good, something the government says it will demand. Previous peace talks with the ELN failed. But analysts say the current talks will benefit from the experiences gained from the successful negotiations between the government and the Farc. The two sides hope to reach an agreement so the conflict can end after 53 years After a ceremony marking the beginning of the formal peace talks on 7 February, the two sides are due to get down to the business of negotiating on 8 February. The opening and closing rounds are scheduled to take place in Ecuador, but the current plan is for the other rounds to take place in the other countries acting as guarantors: Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Norway and Venezuela. However, the head of the government delegation has lobbied against this plan, arguing it will cause too much disruption and delay the process unnecessarily.

Why has Cameroon blocked the internet?,"There have been anti-government protests in Bamenda in recent months Three weeks after reports that Cameroon had blocked the internet in English-speaking parts of the country, residents say services have yet to be restored. So what is going on? Cameroonians have little doubt that pulling the plug on internet services for about 20% of the population is an intentional act by the government. The two regions affected, South-West and North-West, have seen anti-government protests in recent months. Just a day before services disappeared, the Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications issueda statement,externalin which it warned social media users of criminal penalties if they were to ""issue or spread information, including by way of electronic communications or information technology systems, without any evidence"". The statement also confirmed that the authorities had sent text messages direct to mobile phone subscribers, notifying them of penalties, including long jail terms, for ""spreading false news"" via social media. A number of Cameroonians have posted screenshots on Twitter showing the various warnings they were sent. There has been no official comment about the internet since then (or any credible reports of technical faults) leading many Cameroonians to conclude that the severing of services is part of government attempts to stifle dissent. In criticising their government, some Cameroonians have also taken aim at the mobile phone companies who provide the services through which many access the internet. These firms may not have been able to prevent the outage, since they all rely on fibre-optic infrastructure provided by a state-owned company, but nor have they been objecting publicly about the interruption to their services. The biggest provider, MTN Cameroon, denied it had violated customer privacy by forwarding the ministry's warning texts and added that all its services remained accessible. That wason 15 January,externaland since then it has not commented. Some subscribers say they have since received messages referring to ""circumstances beyond our control"". There has been no comment by Orange Cameroun, Nexttel or Vodafone Cameroon. Much of Cameroon's digital economy is located around the South-West capital, Buea - an area known as Silicon Mountain. Some entrepreneurs and their workforces are reported to have relocated temporarily to Douala or Yaounde where the internet is available. Less mobile, digital-dependent businesses will be suffering. The outage is also reported to have hit the banking system, causing cashflow problems for businesses and individuals. A week ago campaign groupInternet Sans Frontieres estimated,externalthat blocking access to the internet over the previous two weeks had cost businesses up to $723,000 (Â£570,000). That may not sound very much now, but the long-term cost of damaging the area's digital ecosystem could be very much higher. And then there are the unquantifiable social costs entailed in cutting channels of communication and entertainment. The United Nations has said internet access is now a basic human right. Cameroonians with access to Twitter have been tweeting their opposition to the outage using the hashtag #BringBackOurInternet. It follows a period of rising tensions in which long-held grievances of English speakers against the government have erupted into protests and strikes. The protesters say that Anglophones are discriminated against by Cameroon's French-speaking majority. Last November,more than 100 people were arrestedand at least one person was shot dead in demonstrations over the use of French in courts and schools. In January,lawyers and teachers in Bamenda went on strikeover the issue, turning the main city in Cameroon's North-West region into a ghost town. North-West and South-West are Cameroon's two English-speaking regions The government responded byarresting activists,externaland warning against protests and ""malicious use of social media"". English speakers in Cameroon say they are often excluded from top civil service jobs and that many government documents are published only in French, even though English is an official language. English-speaking lawyers object to the employment of French-trained court workers who do not understand the English common law system. Residents also object to the posting of teachers who do not speak good English to the region's schools. The official language or languages of African nations are usually a legacy of their colonial past. Cameroon was colonised by Germany in the 19th Century and then split into British and French areas after World War One. Later, areas controlled by Britain and France joined to form Cameroon after the colonial powers withdrew in the 1960s. In 1961, a referendum was held in the previously British areas - Southern Cameroons voted in favour of joining a unitary Cameroonian state, while Northern Cameroons decided instead to become part of neighbouring, English-speaking Nigeria. A secessionist movement, the Southern Cameroons National Council (SCNC), emerged in the 1990s and has been banned. Cameroon timeline There have been many otherpartial or full internet shutdowns by African governmentsin the past 12 months, including in Ethiopia, Gabon, The Gambia, Morocco and Uganda. This is generally seen as an attempt to stop opposition activists from using social media to mobilise protests, although governments say it is to prevent violence, or to stop people circulating false election results. Human rights groups have said such action probably violates international law and should ""never be allowed to become the new normal,external"". Deji Olukotun, senior global advocacy manager at Access Now,said in December,external: ""As more people use the internet and social media, they are also increasingly enjoying the freedom and opportunity these provide to organise themselves and advocate for what they want. ""In response, it seems governments are shutting down the net more often to stop this practice.""

'Don't call me Mrs Clegg',"Miriam Gonzalez Durantez, whose husband is former Deputy Prime Minister Nick Clegg, has complained after being invited to an International Women's Day event in her married name. Posting a picture of a letter addressed to ""Mrs Clegg"" on Instagram, she noted the ""irony"" of the situation. The event, on 8 March, is designed to ""celebrate women's success"", she added. Ms Gonzalez Durantez is a lawyer specialising in international and EU trade law. Miriam Gonzalez Durantez says she does not want to be known by her husband's surname She wrote: ""The irony of being invited to speak at an International Women's Day event to celebrate women's success, addressed to me as 'Mrs Clegg'."" Ms Gonzalez Durantez set up the Inspiring Women group, which recruits women with successful careers to visit and speak to girls at state schools in England. This is not the first time she has criticised the way she is perceived or described. Last year she told Marie Claire magazine: ""I find people say of me 'She wears the trousers' and as you can see, it is true, I have very nice trousers. ""Or if my husband and I share the school run, it's me who has forced him, dragged him away from his work. ""But when people, or in my case the media, are using that label on you, they are not saying you are strong, they are saying you should get back in your box.

Trouble ahead10 charts that show why the NHS is strugglingHealth,"The NHS faces unrelenting pressure despite funding rising. Why? The sheer scale of the NHS can take the breath away. Every 24 hours it sees one million patients, and with 1.7 million staff it's the fifth biggest employer in the world. This vast enterprise absorbs eye-watering amounts of money. Last year Â£140bn was spent on health across the UK - more than 10 times the figure that was ploughed in 60 years ago. And that's after you adjust it for inflation. Governments over the years have had to invest more and more of the public purse into it. Today 30p out of every Â£1 spent on services goes on health. Even during the years of deep austerity, extra money has been found for the health service - Â£8bn more this Parliament in England alone. Yet it seems no matter how much is invested, it's still not enough. The NHS is creaking at the seams. The best barometer of this is the four-hour A&E target. We often think of it as an indication of how good an emergency department is. But it's not. It doesn't tell you about the quality of care - how quickly you get pain relief or whether the unit is good at spotting the signs of a heart attack. Instead it's a sign of whether the system is under stress - both in the community and in the hospital. Which local services are under threat? Upfront charges for foreign patients When there's perfect harmony between the numbers arriving and leaving 95% of patients will be dealt with in four hours. But this isn't happening. You have to go back to the summer of 2015 for the last time it was met in England, with performance deteriorating markedly year on year. The rest of the UK is not immune either. Four-hour performance is worse in Wales and Northern Ireland. Scotland is performing a little better, but is still some way short of the target - its major hospitals have been hovering around the 90% mark in recent weeks. The ageing population is certainly a major factor - and it's one that all health systems in the world are struggling with. Medical advances have meant that people are living longer. When the NHS was created, life expectancy was 13 years shorter than it is now. This is something to celebrate. Infectious diseases are no longer a significant threat. Heart attacks do not claim the lives of people early in the same numbers. Even cancer is not the death sentence it once was - half of people now survive for a decade or more. But this progress has come at a cost. People are living with a growing number of long-term chronic conditions - diabetes, heart disease and dementia. These are more about care than cure - what patients usually need is support. By the age of 65, most people will have at least one of these illnesses. By 75 they will have two. The average 65-year-old costs the NHS 2.5 times more than the average 30-year-old. An 85-year-old costs more than five times as much. As the numbers continue to rise so does the cost to the NHS. This is compounded by the rising cost of new drugs. The health service is currently considering capping the amount it will pay for new drugs at Â£20m each a year. A fifth of new treatments coming on stream cost more than this. Then there's obesity. A third of adults are so overweight they are risking their health significantly. All this contributes to what health economists call health inflation - the idea that the cost of providing care outstrips the normal rise in the cost of living across the economy. This is why health has tended to get more generous rises than other areas of government spending. Over the years this has been achievable through a combination of economic growth, which brings in more money through tax, and reducing spending in areas such as defence, which has led to the NHS taking an ever-greater share of the public purse. But, of course, the economy goes through cycles and over the years governments have varied the amount they were willing or able to give. Since the NHS was created in 1948, the average annual rise has been just over 4%. During the Labour years under Blair and Brown this was closer to 7%. As you can see the period since 2010 has seen the tightest financial settlements. What is more, the spending squeeze is continuing during this Parliament at almost exactly the same rate, even with England's extra Â£8bn going in. Ministers in England are right to say they are increasing funding - it's been frozen in Wales and Scotland - but it's just that it doesn't compare favourably with what the NHS has traditionally got. Indeed, the Institute for Fiscal Studies believes over the 10 years to 2020, the NHS budget across the UK will not have increased enough to keep pace with the ageing and growing population. But is it just a matter of more money? Would an extra few billion make all the problems go away? If you look at other European nations the UK is certainly spending less as a proportion of GDP, which is a measure of the size of the economy. The result, as you would expect, is fewer beds, doctors and nurses per patient in the UK than the big spenders. But a number of these countries achieve that by taxing more. Would the UK public stomach that? If a poll by Ipsos MORI for the BBC this week is anything to go by, they are pretty split - 40% would back a rise in income tax and 53% would support National Insurance going up. Nor does it seem there's appetite for a change in the system. A majority were against charging for services or moving to an insurance-based model like some of our European neighbours do. But even if more money was spent or raised, that would not lead to an overnight improvement. More doctors and nurses would need training and that takes time and, crucially, there is not a flood of people wanting to work in key posts. Trainee posts for GPs are being increased, but the NHS cannot fill them all. There also remain big questions over whether the structure of the NHS is right for 21st Century healthcare. The NHS is still centred on the network of district general hospitals that emerged during the hospital building boom of the 1960s. But in an era where people are struggling with those chronic illnesses, what they really need is support in the community. The problem is there's a serious shortage of this. The number of district nurses in England has been cut by 28% in the past five years, while getting a GP appointment is becoming increasingly difficult. The result is that people end up going to hospital. The numbers visiting A&E have risen by a third in 12 years. Not all of this is down to people with these chronic conditions, but they tend to be the cases that take the most care. Two-thirds of hospitals beds are occupied by the one-third of the population with a long-term condition. There are attempts to change this. To place more emphasis on care outside hospital. NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens has set out a five-year plan to create more integrated care, which involves hospital services working more closely with their local community teams. Similar moves are being made in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. There also an emphasis on prevention - getting people to be more active, eat better diets and drink less. But perhaps the biggest problem is council-run social care. This encompasses day centres, help in the home for tasks such as washing and dressing, and good quality care in care homes during the final years of life. It is seen as essential to keep people well and living independently - and out of hospital. In an era when the population is ageing you would expect more people to be getting help from the state. However, the opposite is true. In England over the past four years, the number of older people getting help has fallen by a quarter. The result is large numbers going without care or having to pay for it themselves. The other parts of the UK can make a case for being more generous in this respect - home care is capped at Â£60 a week in Wales and free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland, while Scotland provides free personal care (washing and dressing) in both care homes and people's own homes. But none of them has cracked it. Indeed, if you were setting up a health and care service today, ask yourself this - how would it be done? Would you separate medical care from personal care? Give one service to a national institution and the other to local councils?  Would you provide one free at the point of need and charge for the other? Would you increase the budget of one, but cut the other? Would you build more than 200 hospitals and spend over half of your budget on them when the biggest users of care are people with long-term illnesses that need care rather than medical intervention? But as that is the system we have got at a time when money is limited, we are falling back on a typical British trait - making do.

Face of islands' saint reconstructed,"Forensic artist Hew Morrison used specialist computer software for his reconstruction of St Magnus A facial reconstruction has been made of Orkney's St Magnus to help mark the 900th anniversary of his death. Forensic artist Hew Morrison's research included studies of photographs taken in the 1920s of what is said to be the skull of the 12th Century Norse earl. Before sainthood, Magnus Erlendsson shared the earldom of Orkney with his cousin, Hakon. Hakon's jealousy of his cousin's popularity on the islands led to Magnus being put to death. Although the date of his martyrdom is uncertain - they range from days in the years 1115 to 1118 - Orkney's annual St Magnus International Festival has chosen 2017to mark the anniversary,external. University of Dundee graduate Mr Morrison, whose other reconstructions include that ofa Bronze Age woman buried in the Highlands, hopes his work on St Magnus will be displayed during the festival. A photograph taken in 1925 of the skull found in a wooden box in Kirkwall's St Magnus Cathedral St Magnus' life and death are a feature ofthe Orkneyinga Saga,external, an interpretation of Orkney's early history, including the conquest of the isles by Norway and the islands' earls. The saga, written between the late 12th and early 13th centuries, tells of the collapse of the cousins' shared earldom. Hakon turned against Magnus and eventually betrayed him and had him executed. The doomed earl's head was split in two by an axe, according to the saga. Miracles were said to have happened where Magnus was buried, including rocky ground changing into a grassy field. Centuries later, in 1919, a wooden box with a skull showing a wound and an assortment of bones inside was discovered during renovations to St Magnus Cathedral in Kirkwall on Orkney. A University of Aberdeen professor and an Aberdeen church minister examined the bones and determined that they must be Magnus' remains. The relics were interred in a pillar of the cathedral. Mr Morrison said he first heard the story of the bones when he was a boy. He said: ""I had forgotten about it until I visited Orkney back in 2015 whilst working on another facial reconstruction project. ""Understanding that the bones are permanently inside a pillar of the cathedral, thus inaccessible, I wondered whether there had ever been decent enough photographs taken of the remains that could be used to recreate a two-dimensional facial reconstruction. ""I managed to track down through Orkney Archives excellent photographs taken in 1925 that were suitable to use."" The relics of St Magnus are held in the care of Kirkwall's cathedral A wooden box found in 1919 is believed to have held the relics of St Magnus Mr Morrison has used computer software to create his reconstruction, drawing on what is shown in the vintage photographs to help guide the shape of skull. He said: ""The photographs from 1925 were fortunately of a good quality, but most importantly a scale ruler was photographed alongside these photographs, which allowed me to scale the skull up to life size. ""The missing jaw was re-created using a formula from the fields of anthropology and orthodontics. ""For this part of the reconstruction, I worked alongside my friend Keli Rae who is also a forensic artist and had previously used this method for replacing missing jaws prior to reconstructions."" Mr Morrison's other work has included a facial reconstruction of a Bronze Age woman who was buried in the Highlands The reconstruction of the Bronze Age woman also involved research of a skull Mr Morrison also drew on modern data of male European tissue measurements to gauge the skin depth for his reconstruction. But he said: ""An individual's hair and eye colour cannot be determined from the anatomy of a skull. ""No DNA/isotopics from samples of bone were available that would have helped to determine hair and eye colour. ""Although there were no visual records such as illustrations or paintings of St Magnus created during the time of his life, there are depictions of him in the form of stained glass windows and statues, but these were created many years after his death."" He added: ""Taking into regard St Magnus's Scandinavian ancestry, light-coloured hair and blue eyes were added to the face."" Orkney's St Magnus festival will be held in June.

'Melbhenge' sun show wins fans in Australia,"Sunlight fills central Melbourne during the event on Tuesday It may not rival ""Manhattanhenge"", but the Australian city of Melbourne has enjoyed its own spectacular solar phenomenon. At 20:27 local time on Tuesday, the setting sun perfectly aligned with the city's east-west streets to cast a golden light between skyscrapers. Dubbed ""Melbhenge"" in reference tothe famous New York spectacle, the event happens biannually, but it gained greater attention this year because of a social media campaigncalling for photographs,externalled by Alan Duffy. ""It's similar in concept to Stonehenge,"" said the Swinburne University astronomer, referring to England's monument where the sun lines up with vertical stones on each of the solstices. ""The example in Melbourne is on a slightly bigger scale, and it has more to do with efficient town planning, rather thananything spiritual."" Melburnians posted images of the phenomenon, which trended on social media Melbourne's grid system, designed by surveyor Robert Hoddle in 1837, affords several potential viewing points in the city centre. But Dr Duffy said trees, trams and low-lying buildings make the choice difficult - not to mention the weather. Local man David Brewster said he had an excellent view from central William St. ""The Melbourne grid is perfect for this sort of thing,"" he told the BBC. ""It was just a very clear night. You get a nice good view with the tram tracks."" David Brewster also photographed the event last year Manhattanhenge has become an attraction for photographers hoping to capture the perfect sunset. Dr Duffy admitted Melbourne could not match New York for its corridors of towering skyscrapers. But he hoped his campaign, asking photographers to post their favourite locations, would make it easier to enjoy Melbhenge in the future. ""I've been astounding by the response,"" he told the BBC. Similar ""henge"" phenomena also occur in other cities with large numbers of skyscrapers and long straight streets - such as Chicago, Montreal and Toronto. This video can not be played Twice a year the Sun sets in alignment between skyscraper corridors, illuminating all east-west streets The term Manhattanhenge was coined by astrophysicist Neil deGrasse Tyson in 1996. Melbourne will next enjoy the display on 3 November, Dr Duffy said.

Honorary degree for Apple boss Tim Cook,"This video can not be played The Apple boss answered questions from university students and staff Apple chief executive Tim Cook has repeated his opposition to US President Donald Trump's travel ban. He was speaking after he collected an honorary doctorate at the University of Glasgow. Earlier Mr Cook visited an Apple store in Glasgow, where staff gave him a tartan scarf and a drawing. His comments on the presidential decree targeting seven predominantly Muslim countries came in a Q&A session at the university. Responding to questions from students and staff, Mr Cook said: ""I wrote this letter, you probably read about it unless you're living underground, about the most recent executive order that was issued in the US. ""We have employees that secured a work visa, they brought family to the US, but happened to be outside the US when the executive order was issued and all of a sudden their families were affected. ""They couldn't get back in. That's a crisis. You can imagine the stress. ""If we stand and say nothing it's as if we're agreeing, that we become a part of it. It's important to speak out."" This video can not be played Apple boss drops in at Glasgow store Mr Cook has taken astrong stance on user privacyand other issues which have at times brought him into conflict with the US authorities. Since taking the helm of the company, Mr Cook has led the introduction of new products such as the iPhone 7, iPad Pro and Apple Watch. He is also leading a company-wide effort to use 100% renewable energy at all Apple facilities. In 2015, the 56-year-old became an honorary patron of Trinity College Dublin's Philosophical Society and gave a talk to students. The embroidered picture presented by the Apple store staff shows Mr Cook waving and the words: ""Welcome Tim."" It also features saltire flags and the Loch Ness monster. He said: ""That's great.

The hospital keeping patients at homeHow one GP practice tackled waiting timesVoices from the NHS frontline workers,"June Lord, 82, is one of those helped home from hospital under the Wakefield project Every Monday morning, in a meeting room within earshot of the bells of Wakefield cathedral, a group of healthcare workers help to stage a mini-revolution. Nothing that you read in the next few minutes may strike you as particularly surprising. Yet the experimental manner in which they are working together in this corner of Yorkshire is being seen as a possible way to improve healthcare across the country, and save the NHS money. At the table is a healthcare assistant, called Kay, Karen the physiotherapist, then Jane the occupational therapist. On the other side sit two mental health nurses both called Rachel, and finally Sue Robson - another mental health nurse who's been with the NHS for 37 years. ""I've seen many, many changes, and this is one of the most exciting,"" smiles Sue. Each Monday, they sit together and plan the care that will be offered to the mostly elderly people they are working with in a number of care homes in the Wakefield district. Because each here brings a different specialism to the table, they can, as a group, build up a complete picture of how best to help each patient. There is one woman they are especially worried about this week. She has fallen quite a few times, but as they talk it begins to look less like a purely physical problem. ""I carried out a physio session last week,"" says Karen. She was ""very anxious. It was difficult to engage with her,"" adds Kay. ""So today if things don't seem to be improving we may look at discussing with the psychiatrist whether she needs a review,"" concludes Sue. ""As professionals we are linking up,"" Sue continues. ""We're discussing the case between ourselves. We have links to the GP. We have links to the mental health services and we are all working together rather than in isolation."" ""We've seen some good results."" Mental health nurse Sue Robson says they have seen good results in Wakefield Across the board this project in Wakefield - which at its most basic aims to get the different parts of the health service and the care system working together - is easing the pressures on the NHS and on care homes. They have seen a sizable reduction in the number of patients who've had to go to hospital from the care homes they work in. A reduction in the use of ambulances. A reduction in the number of days patients who do go to hospital end up spending in a hospital bed. It's both about keeping patients out of hospital in the first place, and getting them home as quickly as possible if they do need to go. In the first nine months of 2016-17, phase one of the Wakefield Vanguard Care Homes scheme recorded: 19% reduction in emergency admissions 12% reduction A&E attendances 9% reduction in ambulance call-outs 26% reduction in bed days Source: Wakefield Clinical Commissioning Group The project has involved NHS workers training up care home staff beyond the basic first aid most already have. That gives care homes the skills they need to better diagnose what is wrong with a resident who falls ill. It is resulting in better care for patients and fewer 999 calls for an ambulance. There are also efforts to improve people's health in the first place. A lot of work is going into making the men and women who live in care homes and ""independent living"" flats (they used to be known as sheltered accommodation) feel less isolated. Sharon Carter runs one project that aims to stop the elderly feeling lonely. It's called Portrait of a Life. Essentially it's a photo and memory book that residents like 91-year-old Marjorie Smith receive. Marjorie Smith is a resident at the Croftlands independent living scheme It helps them reminisce, it helps other older people living in the same accommodation get to know their neighbours, and it helps care staff learn about what makes the people in their care tick. ""We're finding they have a better sense of well-being as opposed to ill-being,"" says Sharon. Along with everything else the project is doing, she says it's led to fewer people going into hospital and residential care. Many of course still do end up in hospital. And when they do Louise Lumley works at the ""getting them home"" end of the process. She's part of Age UK's Wakefield District team, and outside Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield she's securing 82-year-old June Lord's wheelchair in the back of an adapted car. It will be a 20-minute journey home. When they arrive, Louise goes through a list of questions. Does June have someone who can help her in the coming days? Does she have the medicine she needs? Is there anything at home that's particularly dangerous that might need to be made safe, to prevent future injuries? The answers will go into a database that can help tailor June's care in the coming months.

Video: What happens when a hospital clogs up Voices from NHS frontline Iris Sibley's long wait to leave hospital There is plenty of other work besides. A local not-for-profit Housing Association sits in meetings with health staff to work out how best to improve the lives of the elderly people who rent flats from them. They're trying to join up all the parts of the system as much as they can. Everyone here stresses it's about improving patient care. But there are savings to be made. They estimate that if they roll this project out across the whole district, by 2021 they will make a net saving of Â£5.3m a year.

How one GP practice tackled waiting timesVoices from the NHS frontline workers,"Dr Cope believes new ways of working have been a success A GP practice in Plymouth has reduced the time it takes to get a routine appointment with a doctor from three-to-four weeks to under seven days. The Beacon Medical Group cares for more than 30,000 patients and was formed in 2014 after three practices merged. Dr Jonathan Cope, GP and managing partner at Plympton Health Centre, one of the Beacon practices which has 10 doctors, says, at present, there are 30 unfilled GP posts in Plymouth. Three years ago, his practice was unable to recruit the equivalent of one-and-a-half full-time GPs. ""We made a conscious decision to look elsewhere, to work differently. So we decided to looks at what skills clinical pharmacists, paramedic practitioners and nurse practitioners could offer. We converted that budget to two-and-a-half full-time equivalents."" Patients registered at Plympton who feel they need same-day care from their family doctor call the reception team at the surgery. Depending on the problem, they will then be called back by an advanced paramedic, pharmacist, nurse practitioner - or a doctor. Beacon Medical Group has started to offer new services Dr Cope said: ""Because of the extra capacity, we have freed up the GPs' time. So we are offering more appointments for routine problems, and the waiting times are now shorter."" The advanced paramedic practitioner, Simon Robinson, responds to any emergency medical problems in the practice, as well as doing, on average, four home visits a day. He says he is often called out to see the more complex cases and his daily schedule allows him to spend more time than the GPs with patients. Simon was keen to point out that if he does have any queries he just has to knock on the GPs' door. Prof Helen Stokes-Lampard, chair of the Royal College of GPs, said while paramedics are highly valued and trusted, they have different skills and training. ""GPs are highly trained to take into account the physical, psychological and social factor - this unique skill set cannot be replaced by another healthcare professional, however well meaning the intention is. ""We do not have enough GPs in the NHS - and actually we don't have enough paramedics either. This transference of workload pressures from one area of the health service to another is not going to benefit our patients in the long term."" In an effort to understand the pressures on the Beacon Medical Group, the 100 most frequent attendees were analysed. Dr Cope expected the list to be dominated by frail, elderly patients but instead the typical patient was a 37-year-old woman, often with mental health problems, multiple prescriptions and referrals to hospital. From March, a psychiatrist will do a weekly clinic from the surgery for these patients and provide additional training on mental health care to staff. It is part of a parallel drive to offer specialised new services more commonly found in a hospital setting. Dr Frow has provided specialist dermatology care Dr Helen Frow, a GP with a special interest in dermatology, has provided care to patients registered to the group in the last two years. ""Onward referrals to the hospital have reduced by 85%,"" she said. A similar scheme for musculoskeletal care resulted in 75% fewer secondary care appointments. The model of working with between 30,000 to 50,000 patients in a multi-specialty community provider model is known as a Primary Care Home. There were 14 other sites working to this structure across England in the last year. The National Association of Primary Care is working closely with NHS England to explore how they can continue to expand working in this way. A BMA spokesperson said: ""Many GP practices are increasingly becoming hubs where nurses and other professionals work together to deliver services to patients. ""However, while this is encouraging, England is suffering from a drastic and worsening shortage of GPs that is damaging patient care and restricting the number of appointments on offer to the public. ""The government needs to address this workforce crisis urgently.""

Voices from the NHS frontline workers,"Andrew Foster is the chief executive of Wrightington, Wigan and Leigh NHS Foundation Trust. It is one of the best performing hospital trusts and up until a year ago it was meeting the four-hour A&E target. But that began to change in 2016. Instead of hitting the 95% target for patients to be seen and treated or admitted, performance dropped to 90% and then 85% in the autumn, before it nosedived following Christmas. ""It started from Boxing Day onwards,"" says Mr Foster. ""We had an outbreak of norovirus which closed three wards and led to 75 staff being off sick. Seven care homes had to shut too. ""It meant our performance dropped to around 60%. It was the worst three weeks I've ever known. Cubicles in A&E were full, we had ambulance staff queuing in the corridors and we could not get patients out of hospital. The whole system backed up."" Since mid-January pressures have eased with four-hour performance back above 80%. But Mr Foster is still worried. ""The problem we have is that we are seeing more and more patients coming to A&E who could be seen by a GP and then we are finding it more difficult to discharge patients. There are simply not the places available any more because of the cuts to social care or we are seeing care homes and families themselves saying that the person's care is too complex. They end up staying in hospital."" Simon Walsh is a consultant in an A&E department in a major trauma centre in London. ""This year things have been closer to breaking point than I've ever known it before,"" he says. ""The set of nights I worked in the period before Christmas were the most difficult I remember working in the last 10 years. ""There was just such pressure on the system and as a result the exit block was so sustained that we had patients stuck for hours on end because there weren't any beds available to admit them on to wards. We had in excess of 20 patients at times for the whole night. And it just paralyses the emergency department."" He says patients and their families were understanding, even though they were frustrated. ""The relatives expressed their frustration but it wasn't anger directed at us - they recognised it was factors out of our control."" But he says morale was low among staff. ""I don't think I've ever seen such tired, exhausted people, they were absolutely dead on their feet. ""People try and keep each other up with as high morale as they can but I think people in that period were close to breaking point. ""I wondered if people would actually come back for the next shift after a couple of the nights we did."" Kimberley Gardner is a nurse at a major trauma centre in the East Midlands working in the critical care department, while her partner is also a nurse in the emergency department. She sayscalling the situation in the NHS a humanitarian crisis,as the Red Cross did in January, ""is not hyperbole, it is the reality"". ""It is the worst I've ever known it. ""During the coalition years we heard the term 'black alert' being thrown around, but it would never actually happen, it seemed as likely as a major disaster or terrorist attack - devastating- but highly unlikely. Now it's a weekly and sometimes daily occurrence and the novelty has worn off. ""Daily we get a phone call from an emergency department begging critical care for equipment to monitor patients as all of their resus bays have been 'doubled up' (where they put two patients in one bay) meaning they need two monitors but only have one. They ask us but we have run out also."" She says another issue is not enough trained paramedics or dispatchers for 111, the NHS non-emergency phoneline. ""The amount of people sent in by 111 to be on the safe side, it's a total failure. ""I saw a woman brought in by ambulance after eating a tin of Quality Street and she was vomiting - why would she ring an ambulance but also why did the crew bring her in? Because a lot of the time they are technicians and not trained paramedics so bring them in to be on the safe side."" Julie Orr is the head of clinical services for Milton Keynes University Hospital NHS Foundation Trust. She oversees the flow of patients through the hospital managing the site team, bed managers and discharge team. ""It's been a challenge this winter. I think the main difference has been that it's been sustained pressure. It's been quite relentless rather than periods of a couple of weeks of pressure. ""I've been in the NHS for 30 years and this is probably one of the most sustained, relentlessly pressured winters that I've seen. ""People don't really have time to catch their breath before the next onslaught of pressures."" Julie Orr with her team A former nursing manager, she says all her team are senior clinicians and move around the site ensuring the flow of patients through the hospital. ""We've had some very difficult days, which has meant that not only the site team but the managers on call and the executive on call have been on site for many, many hours into the night to make sure the patients are safe and that the staff are supported."" But she says her teams have coped ""remarkably well"" despite the pressure. ""Obviously it's very difficult. We all want to do the best for our patients and want to get them home wherever possible or on to the next stage of their journey - I think  sometimes there's not an understanding of why that can't happen. My discharge team along with the ward nursing teams spend a lot of time with patients trying to explain why there might be a delay in that happening."" Grainne Siggins is director of adult social care for the London Borough of Newham. ""Our staff and our staff within the NHS have worked incredibly hard this winter, it's been really difficult. But in December working positively with our colleagues we didn't have any delayed transfers (out of hospital) at all due to social care."" She knows from speaking to her local peers within London they are an ""outlier"" to be in this situation. Because of the borough's diverse population and high levels of deprivation and health issues they bring, the team has had to ""proactively plan"" - but she says ""it's becoming increasingly difficult going forward"". She says they have been heavily supported by their clinical commissioning group. ""Councils are currently prioritising adults and children's services above other areas of spending, but that will only go so far and we do feel we are at a tipping point and that's been borne out this winter - it's difficult to see how the whole system will be able to be sustained next year."" And she says the ageing population means assessments are taking much longer. ""People have got much more complex needs, multiple long term conditions, so we've got that added level of complexity. ""We've seen a significant increase in the level of support we then have to provide to people to make sure they can go home safely and that they are appropriately supported."" Dr Olivia Hum has been a GP since 2007. She works in a surgery in Lewes, east Sussex. ""The intensity of the work in 2017 is really bad. We work 10-12 hours a day without a break,"" she says. She says the demand on GPs has increased ""because of the pressure on hospitals"". ""A&E is too crowded which means that people are not diagnosed properly and they come to the GP for the rest of their health problems. They then bounce back to the hospital. ""The local hospital has seen a huge decline in funding, so people are on six to nine-month waiting lists. This has a huge impact on GPs who are dealing with the deteriorating symptoms of people waiting for tests or treatment, including patients who have symptoms of cancer. This waiting also has huge personal impact on patients, it increases their worry and stress."" She adds: ""There is a real crisis in GP staffing. Lots of practices are closing, so patients try to register at the practice next door which has no space. GPs are burning out, they are overworked and many are retiring early. The system is unsustainable now. ""It is just impossible to provide extra appointments in practices. I know GPs with almost twice as many patients as I have and they can only provide care at a very basic level. It is not safe - the brain can't make these decisions properly in less than 10 minutes. In these cases, quality of care and patient safety is compromised.""

Money-saving pioneer,"June Lord, 82, is one of those helped home from hospital under the Wakefield project Every Monday morning, in a meeting room within earshot of the bells of Wakefield cathedral, a group of healthcare workers help to stage a mini-revolution. Nothing that you read in the next few minutes may strike you as particularly surprising. Yet the experimental manner in which they are working together in this corner of Yorkshire is being seen as a possible way to improve healthcare across the country, and save the NHS money. At the table is a healthcare assistant, called Kay, Karen the physiotherapist, then Jane the occupational therapist. On the other side sit two mental health nurses both called Rachel, and finally Sue Robson - another mental health nurse who's been with the NHS for 37 years. ""I've seen many, many changes, and this is one of the most exciting,"" smiles Sue. Each Monday, they sit together and plan the care that will be offered to the mostly elderly people they are working with in a number of care homes in the Wakefield district. Because each here brings a different specialism to the table, they can, as a group, build up a complete picture of how best to help each patient. There is one woman they are especially worried about this week. She has fallen quite a few times, but as they talk it begins to look less like a purely physical problem. ""I carried out a physio session last week,"" says Karen. She was ""very anxious. It was difficult to engage with her,"" adds Kay. ""So today if things don't seem to be improving we may look at discussing with the psychiatrist whether she needs a review,"" concludes Sue. ""As professionals we are linking up,"" Sue continues. ""We're discussing the case between ourselves. We have links to the GP. We have links to the mental health services and we are all working together rather than in isolation."" ""We've seen some good results."" Mental health nurse Sue Robson says they have seen good results in Wakefield Across the board this project in Wakefield - which at its most basic aims to get the different parts of the health service and the care system working together - is easing the pressures on the NHS and on care homes. They have seen a sizable reduction in the number of patients who've had to go to hospital from the care homes they work in. A reduction in the use of ambulances. A reduction in the number of days patients who do go to hospital end up spending in a hospital bed. It's both about keeping patients out of hospital in the first place, and getting them home as quickly as possible if they do need to go. In the first nine months of 2016-17, phase one of the Wakefield Vanguard Care Homes scheme recorded: 19% reduction in emergency admissions 12% reduction A&E attendances 9% reduction in ambulance call-outs 26% reduction in bed days Source: Wakefield Clinical Commissioning Group The project has involved NHS workers training up care home staff beyond the basic first aid most already have. That gives care homes the skills they need to better diagnose what is wrong with a resident who falls ill. It is resulting in better care for patients and fewer 999 calls for an ambulance. There are also efforts to improve people's health in the first place. A lot of work is going into making the men and women who live in care homes and ""independent living"" flats (they used to be known as sheltered accommodation) feel less isolated. Sharon Carter runs one project that aims to stop the elderly feeling lonely. It's called Portrait of a Life. Essentially it's a photo and memory book that residents like 91-year-old Marjorie Smith receive. Marjorie Smith is a resident at the Croftlands independent living scheme It helps them reminisce, it helps other older people living in the same accommodation get to know their neighbours, and it helps care staff learn about what makes the people in their care tick. ""We're finding they have a better sense of well-being as opposed to ill-being,"" says Sharon. Along with everything else the project is doing, she says it's led to fewer people going into hospital and residential care. Many of course still do end up in hospital. And when they do Louise Lumley works at the ""getting them home"" end of the process. She's part of Age UK's Wakefield District team, and outside Pinderfields Hospital in Wakefield she's securing 82-year-old June Lord's wheelchair in the back of an adapted car. It will be a 20-minute journey home. When they arrive, Louise goes through a list of questions. Does June have someone who can help her in the coming days? Does she have the medicine she needs? Is there anything at home that's particularly dangerous that might need to be made safe, to prevent future injuries? The answers will go into a database that can help tailor June's care in the coming months.

Pensioner finds 'fishing mate' after online ad,"Ray Johnstone flew across Australia to join his new ""fishing mate"" for a trip Two weeks ago, lonely Australian grandfather Ray Johnstone decided to try his luck at finding a ""fishing mate"" online, on the suggestion of a care nurse. Now the 75-year-old pensioner finds himself on the other side of Australia with a new friend and a haul of fish. An age difference of more than 50 years hasn't got in the way of a blossoming friendship between Mr Johnstone and Mati Batsinilas, a carpenter who lives in Brisbane. Moved by the online post, in which Mr Johnstone explained that his former fishing companion had died, Mr Batsinilas, 22, paid for the widowed pensioner to fly from his home in South Australia to Brisbane, more than 1,600km (995 miles) away. They are now on a special trip off the Queensland coast. Mr Batsinilas was just one of many people who said they wanted to go fishing with Mr Johnstone after his original post went viral. Lonely fisherman's plea charms Australia According to the Courier Mail newspaper an 80cm (31in) mulloway fish was among the grandfather's haul on Tuesday, the first day of a two-day trip with Mr Batsinilas. The pair had planned to camp overnight on the picturesque North Stradbroke island. One of the pair's haul off the Queensland coast ""This has been more of an adventure than a trip for Ray,"" Mr Batsinilas said. And Ray's verdict? ""It was a really good day,""he told the newspaper,externalfrom Amity Point, on the island. Mr Johnstone's online ad, which was posted on 19 January More than 115,000 people have now seen the original post. Explaining his love for fishing, Mr Johnstone told the BBC last week that he just liked ""getting out in the fresh air"" and keeping active. ""I don't want to end up as a vegetable like some old people do,"" he said. You might also be interested in: What's going on in this Oscars ""class photo""? Battle of the Kylies: Who won?

'How the NHS has changed our lives',"The NHS has come under intense pressure this winter, with record numbers of patients facing long waits in accident and emergency units among other challenges. We asked some of those who have fallen ill, and the families of others, to share their experiences of winter 2016-17. Sue'sfather's life changed dramatically after he fell out of bed while in hospital in December 2016. Bryan, 84, had been admitted to hospital near their house in Cornwall for a hip operation. Sue says she was not told about his fall for several days, eventually she was told he would not walk again and possibly had only six months left to live. ""I am devastated - six weeks ago everything was fine, now this is not the world I imagined I'd be in. ""In December he was walking into town, doing gardening, he loved mechanics and tinkering. ""Now in hospital his mental health has really deteriorated, he does not speak and strips naked in public. ""I blame the trauma of the fall and the time he's been forced to spend in hospital. ""I'm really on edge, I feel like I'm about to fall off a cliff. ""I break down in tears at least once a day. ""He's had his life taken away too soon. ""Are we saying that because he's too complicated, our society can't care for him? ""It seems like such a big fight to just find out from the hospital what is going on. ""I just hope to God that he doesn't understand what is happening to him. ""I feel like he'll never come home again, he seems lost to us."" John Perrinswas on the M6 motorway, driving home from Cambridge, when he realised he was having a heart attack. An ambulance driver himself, he had feared he would never see his wife again - so intense was the pain. But a paramedic saved his life at the side of the road. ""I was vomiting and felt like a horse was kicking me in the chest. ""My wife called an ambulance, which arrived within 10 minutes - seeing the blue lights was the most wonderful thing I've ever seen. ""I passed out, but apparently they performed three lots of heart massage - 90 compressions. ""When I came round they spoke to me and, although I was scared, the way that the paramedic spoke to me made me feel safe. ""The ambulance crew were absolutely phenomenal. ""A friend who is a paramedic came to see me and he told me that the last six heart attack patients he worked on had died - I felt so lucky that I had this particular ambulance crew. ""They have given me my life back. ""The paramedic was treating me, teaching a trainee and looking after my wife in the ambulance - I could not have asked for a better person. ""I am trying to find out the names of the ambulance crew - I want to find them so I can say thank you."" Trevor, 58, says that the NHS has treated his diabetes and depression ""brilliantly"" Trevor Dallimore-Wrightsays his local GP and hospital are ""like a family"" to him, regularly providing life-saving care for his complex health conditions. ""The NHS has been absolutely brilliant,"" says Trevor, from London, who has diabetes and depression. ""My GP keeps me sane and out of hospital - I would give her 10 out of 10. ""I've had emergency admittance twice recently with sepsis - I went to A&E and was treated very quickly. ""They've had a great impact on my life. ""NHS treatment has helped me during the times that I could not get out of bed. ""My GP is extremely kind and patient. They are so patient-centred, I would put them in the luxury bracket. ""All the hospital staff are extraordinarily friendly. ""They are there despite the infrastructure problems in the NHS, and the care could not be better. ""From the moment I walk in, I know I'm being looked after. ""My only problem is that the NHS won't pay for immunotherapy drugs which are at the front line of treatment but are expensive."" Nikki, 36, had her scheduled operation cancelled twice and she is still waiting Thirty six-year-oldNikki Alldis'satisfaction levels are at the other end of the spectrum, however, despite also living London. She says she has waited 15 months for a bowel operation, which has been twice cancelled. When the procedure was scheduled for early January, she mentally prepared her young children and rearranged her work. But Nikki has twice received a last-minute call telling her there is no bed space. She is still waiting. ""I'd prepared mentally - I planned my whole Christmas around the operation and recovery. I prepared frozen dinners for my kids, they are seven and 13, and I said a farewell goodbye. ""Then in the morning the nurse called me and said, 'We have no bed for you.' ""I was gutted. The kids were so confused when they came home and I was still there. ""I've been waiting for 15 months now - it's hanging over me. ""I did not believe the second appointment would happen, but I packed my bags anyway. ""We didn't even bother to rearrange my husband's work that time, if he's not working we're not earning, so we can't afford these cancellations. ""I put things in place with my work for people to cover me. ""I'm still waiting, hopefully it's third time lucky."" When 29-year-oldPaulwas feeling suicidal in January, the NHS crisis care team in west London gave him 24-hour care to keep him safe. He has received treatment for bipolar disorder for four years and says his consultant and crisis team are outstanding. ""They helped me in my darkest and most depressive hours,"" says Paul, who asked for his surname not to be revealed. ""I came back home after New Year and went back to day-to-day life, but it kicked off a hefty depression and I was left feeling really low and suicidal. ""My partner called the crisis team, and they came to our house three or four times a day. ""They come at 02:00 or 03:00, they are really responsive. ""I don't feel like they are just doing their jobs, they have genuine care for me. ""They take away my medication to make sure I will not overdose and when they visit, they make me take the medication. ""Sometimes they just spend time with me. ""They ask how I am, what did you eat and sometimes they make me do things like go and buy some milk, which I don't always feel able to do. ""I would not be alive without them. ""But one problem I have with NHS mental health care is that they medicate but do not do counselling, there is a massive waiting list, so now I have to get counselling privately."" ""Before she was diagnosed with cancer, my mum could run a marathon,"" saysRichard Taylor, 55 from Liverpool. He was devastated after watching her ""undignified"" death last month. The local cancer centre did not have the capacity to give her end-of-life care. ""After she received the second diagnosis, she was sent home and we got caught in a communication loop between three hospitals. It was an emotional rollercoaster. ""Eventually I had to take her to A&E  - she could not eat or drink. ""She spent 13 hours on a trolley, behind a curtain in a noisy and busy ward. ""I stayed on a chair beside her and slept on the floor - she died a week later. ""My gripe is with the lack of communication and the delays in my mum's treatment. ""The nursing staff were fantastic, but there is only so much they can do - they could not give my mum 24-hour attention. ""She was a very proud and dignified woman - but in the end she was simply scared to be alone. ""It was awful watching someone die in this extremely undignified way. ""If she was an animal, they would have put her down - she was starving and dehydrated. ""The nurses were lovely and compassionate, but they offered me no support. ""The NHS is a great thing, but it is under the hammer.""

Did we report Trump 'under-reported' attacks?7 February 2017 (17:00:10),"This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""All over Europe it's happening. It's gotten to a point where [attacks are] not even being reported."" US President Donald Trump has accused the media of under-reporting terror attacks, and produced a list to back up his claim. Is he right? While on a visit to US Central Command, a wing of the Department of Defense, he warned of the danger posed by the Islamic State group. ""You have seen what happened in Paris and Nice. All over Europe it's happening,"" he said. ""It's gotten to a point where it's not even being reported. And in many cases the very, very dishonest press doesn't want to report it. ""They have their reasons, and you understand that."" Later in the day, the White House published a list of attacks ""executed or inspired"" by IS. Before the list was published, press secretary Sean Spicer said there were ""several instances"" of attacks that had not gained sufficient media coverage (without specifying which fell into that category). We have reproduced the list below, explaining in each case what happened and whether we reported on it. Of the 78 incidents listed by the White House, we did not report only 12 of them - some were so minor they received barely any coverage elsewhere. Just because the BBC covered an attack does not mean that incident was not under-reported, although it is unclear whether Mr Trump was referring to US or global news organisations. And some terrorist incidents do get more coverage than others, a point that has been hotly debated on social media. Most of the atrocities listed by the White House were committed by Islamists, and the killing of nine black worshippers by a self-avowed white supremacist in South Carolina is notably absent. Absent too is the 2016 bombing of a shopping centre in Baghdad that killed some 300 people, and last week's deadly assault on a mosque in Quebec City.

Will it be easier to build on green belt?7 February 2017 (16:47:21),"The claim:The green belt is safe from an increase in development. Reality Check verdict:The rules for developing green belt previously said that it was allowed only in exceptional circumstances. The government has now specified what would count as exceptional circumstances. It is not clear whether the new rules will be more or less strict than just letting councils decide what counted as exceptional circumstances. The government has described the housing market as broken, promised more affordable homes and said it would help people to buy and rent. A big question in discussions of increasing the supply of homes is whether planning regulations will be changed to make it easier to build on green belt land. Green belts were introduced after World War Two to stop cities from sprawling and countryside being spoilt. About 13% of England is now covered. This covers scenic sites open to the public, such as the Chiltern Hills and North Downs, but it also covers a lot of land that has limited public access and may not be particularly beautiful. In the House of Commons, Communities Secretary Sajid Javid said: ""In 2015, we promised the British people that the green belt was safe in our hands and that is still the case."" So what has changed? There has been little variation in the amount of green belt land since 1997, although data is not available for every year. The Housing White Paper,externalsays the current planning regulations allow building on the green belt only ""in exceptional circumstances"" but that there is no detail given of what would amount to exceptional circumstances. The government has now specified that before allowing development on green belt land, councils would need to rule out options including: using brown field sites or estate regeneration using land that is currently underused, including surplus public sector land other authorities helping to provide land for development The White Paper also says that councils allowing the boundaries of green belt land to be changed would have to make up for it by improving other bits of green belt. It also asks for suggestions of other things councils should take into account before doing so.

ELN peace talks: What are the challenges?8 February 2017 (00:49:28),"The ELN is Colombia's second-largest rebel group The National Liberation Army (ELN), Colombia's second-largest rebel group, has entered into formal peace talks with Colombian government negotiators. The talks are aimed at ending more than five decades of armed conflict. Here, we take a closer look at the discussions ahead. In March 2016, government negotiator Frank Pearl and ELN rebel Antonio Garcia said they would engage in formal peace talks Yes, the ELN and the government first announced their intention to start formal peace talks at a news conference on 30 March 2016. They had originally been expected to start in May 2016, but did not go ahead. Later, the two sides said the negotiations would start in the Ecuadorean capital, Quito, on 27 October, but that date also came and went. A new date was set for 7 February 2017. The government said it would not start formal talks until the ELN released Odin Sanchez Colombian President Juan Manuel Santos said that a precondition for the talks was the release of hostages the ELN was holding. The ELN has long used kidnapping for ransom as a means of financing itself. It also considers the kidnapping of soldiers and police officers a legitimate tactic. The rebels eventually agreed to free a soldier they had recently seized andformer Congressman Odin Sanchezin exchange for a pardon for two of its jailed members. The move finally paved the way for formal talks to start. However, future delays cannot be ruled out as the ELN has been reluctant to hurry the negotiations along. In an answer to an open letter by Colombian intellectuals asking the rebels to negotiate speedily, ELN leader Nicolas Rodriguez said that ""for the ELN, setting a deadline for peace means obstructing it"". The ELN claims that it is ""always close to the people"" President Santos has set his aims high. He says he wants to ""achieve complete peace"". The ELN says it also wants peace but Mr Rodriguez, better known as Gabino, says he does not want the negotiations just to be between the government and the ELN but for civil society to be involved, too. The six points on the agenda are currently rather vague. They are: Participation of civil society in peace building Democracy for peace Transformations for peace Victims End of the armed conflict Implementation The ELN has been fighting the Colombian state for more than five decades The group was founded in 1964 and follows a Marxist-Leninist ideology. It was inspired by the Cuban revolution of 1959 with an aim to fighting Colombia's unequal distribution of land and riches. It feels particularly strongly that the country's oil and mineral riches should be shared among its people rather than exploited by foreign multinationals. Over the decades, the guerrilla group has attacked large landholders and multinational companies. It has repeatedly blown up oil pipelines. In the talks, its representatives are likely to call for social change to achieve more equality and for the inclusion in politics of Colombians whose voices they say have gone unheard for too long. The ELN has fewer members than Colombia's largest rebel group, the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (Farc) The ELN is believed to have fewer than 1,500 active fighters, according to intelligence reports seen by Colombian media. They are backed up by a larger number of ""militants"" or sympathisers who provide logistical support and back-up. Its strongholds are in rural areas in the north and on the border with Venezuela, and also in the provinces of Casanare, Norte de Santander and Cauca. The ELN is made up of regional commandos which have a certain degree of autonomy, which could make implementation of any deal hard to achieve. Peace talks held between 2002 and 2007 failed. The government said the ELN ""lacked commitment"" Both sides say they are completely committed to the negotiations succeeding. The government would like to see a deal signed before the presidential election in May 2018 but the ELN has said it will not be rushed. Observers of the peace process think the ELN may prove harder to negotiate with than Colombia's largest rebel group, the Farc, with whom the government signed a peace deal in November. That is because the ELN is less hierarchical in its structure and its members are believed to be more wedded to their Marxist ideology than the Farc. The ELN also has not yet sworn off kidnappings for good, something the government says it will demand. Previous peace talks with the ELN failed. But analysts say the current talks will benefit from the experiences gained from the successful negotiations between the government and the Farc. The two sides hope to reach an agreement so the conflict can end after 53 years After a ceremony marking the beginning of the formal peace talks on 7 February, the two sides are due to get down to the business of negotiating on 8 February. The opening and closing rounds are scheduled to take place in Ecuador, but the current plan is for the other rounds to take place in the other countries acting as guarantors: Brazil, Chile, Cuba, Norway and Venezuela. However, the head of the government delegation has lobbied against this plan, arguing it will cause too much disruption and delay the process unnecessarily.

Kylie v Kylie: The story of a trademark battle7 February 2017 (03:10:41),"Kylie Minogue has released fragrances, furniture and clothes with her trademarks on them A trademark battle between Kylie Minogue and Kylie Jenner appears to have come to an end. Jenner, who first shot to fame in the US reality TV show Keeping Up With the Kardashians, has been trying to trademark the name Kylie in the US. But she has been blocked by the veteran Australian pop star Minogue, best known for hits such as I Should Be So Lucky and Can't Get You Out Of My Head. After a long and heated battle, the Kylies may have reached a settlement. According to papers filed with the US Patent and Trademark Office (USPTO), in April 2015 Jenner attempted to register the mark ""KYLIE"" in the US for ""advertising services"" and ""endorsement services"". Ms Jenner is the younger half-sister of Kim Kardashian In response, Minogue's teamfiled their opposition,externalin February 2016, citing possible confusion and ""damage"" to  Minogue's branding. They noted Minogue was an ""internationally renowned performing artist, humanitarian and breast cancer activist"" who already owns Kylie-related trademarks in the US in several industries, as well as the website www.kylie.com. Jenner, on the other hand, was dismissed as a ""secondary reality television personality"" who had drawn criticism for her ""photographic exhibitionism and controversial posts"" on social media. In February 2016 Minogue tweeted this message, shortly after her team filed its opposition The case was suspended at least twice in 2016 for settlement negotiations. On 19 January Minogue's team withdrew its opposition, which means Jenner's application could proceed. This raises the possibility that they agreed to a settlement. The BBC approached both sides, but Jenner's lawyers declined comment, and Minogue's team did not respond. The USPTO does not comment on individual cases. Kylie Jenner, who is known for her full-looking lips, released a range of lip glosses last year But meanwhile Jenner appears to have conclusively lost another battle - to trademark her full name. In November 2015, Jenner's lawyers separatelytried to trademark,externalthe name ""KYLIE JENNER"" for a long list of clothing and accessories. But this was rejected in July last year. On 23 January, Jenner's teamappealed against this decision.,external Flight attendant shares story of saving trafficking victim Why do Germans hate this football club? How to own a home in the UK by the age of 25 Last year, Jenner launched a line of cosmetics called KYLIE. According to her latest appeal, she wants to eventually have ""KYLIE JENNER"" branded clothing as well as loungewear, swimwear, and underwear. Meanwhile, Minogue owns ""KYLIE"" and other similar trademarks in perfumes and toiletries, music and sound recordings, live entertainment, jewellery, dolls and toys, and printed matter such as magazines and books. So far, Minogue has released fragrances, furniture and clothes with her trademarks on them. In 2007 Minogue launched her fragrance line which is registered in the US as Kylie Minogue Darling She also had previously said in interviews she intends to one day produce a musical featuring her greatest hits, and owns the US trademark for ""Lucky: The Kylie Minogue Musical"". But it's more than that. Since the 1980s, Kylie Minogue has never had to go by any other name but Kylie, and her team has argued it's a fundamental part of the pop diva's identity. Even with a possible settlement, what the battle shows is that at the very least brand KYLIE is not won without a fight. Reporting by the BBC's Tessa Wong, Kevin Ponniah and Jay Savage.
