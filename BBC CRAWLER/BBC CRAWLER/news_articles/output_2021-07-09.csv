Raheem Sterling - from scapegoat to national icon," Produced and written by Miriam Walker-Khan Produced and written by Miriam Walker-Khan Turn right out of Neeld Crescent, walk past Harrow Road’s cluster of fast-food shops, cross the train line on the concrete footbridge and, around half a mile later, you're standing on the Wembley Stadium concourse. It was a short and simple journey for Raheem Sterling from his home in Brent, north-west London, to the national stadium where he dreamed of playing. In fact, if you look closely at Sterling’s forearm, you’ll see a tattoo of a young boy holding a football, looking up at the Wembley arch. You might not have heard about it, although the chances are you will know about the one of a gun on his right leg. Those two images – and what they have come to represent – tell us a lot about Sterling’s journey from child prodigy to European Championship finalist, one that has been anything but straightforward. It is a tale of loss, of racism, of vilification, of talent, of dreaming big and of a sportsman’s power to make a difference on and off the pitch. And, at every stage, of proving his doubters wrong. At times that glare has shone on his performances for club and country. But often that has been a sideshow. An incident from 2018 says a lot about the challenges he has endured. “Raheem shoots himself in foot” screamed the front page of the Sun newspaper, as pictures emerged of a tattoo of on M16 assault rifle on his leg. It was “sick”, the paper added. But there was so much more to the story than met the eye. Sterling’s father was shot dead in Kingston, Jamaica, when Raheem was two. With the World Cup a matter of weeks away, he was having to explain himself, saying the tattoo had a “deeper meaning” and that it reflected a vow he made to “never touch a gun” after his father was killed. Not for the first time, the frenzy around Sterling, rather than his football, became the focus.  Sterling never knew his dad, but there was no lack of parental influence. He cites his mother, Nadine, as the most significant factor in his football career. It was Nadine who brought him to England, setting up home in Neasden, north-west London, when he was five. She gained an education while cleaning bathrooms and changing bed-sheets. Sterling spent time at Vernon House, a special school, where teachers attempted to help with his behavioural problems. Writing for Players’ Tribune, Sterling said: “I just didn’t like to listen to anyone but my mum. That was my problem.” “If you carry on the way you’re going, by the time you’re 17 you’ll either be playing for England or you’ll be in prison,” teacher Chris Beschi told 10-year-old Sterling. Beschi was right. On 14 November 2012 – 24 days short of his 18thbirthday – Sterling made his first senior England appearance. By the time of his England debut, Sterling had a reputation as a precociously talented, pacy attacker. He had already become the third-youngest player to represent Liverpool, and the second-youngest to score for them in a competitive fixture. Those landmarks were just the start. He was soon one of the club’s most important players and, in 2013-14, formed a thrilling attack alongside Luis Suarez and Daniel Sturridge, which looked set to end the Reds’ 34-year wait for a top-flight title. That climaxed with a Steven Gerrard slip and heartbreak for Liverpool, but Sterling was soon playing regular Champions League football. That year he won Europe’s prestigious Golden Boy award, an honour bestowed by journalists on the player deemed to be the continent’s best young player. But alongside this success came something sinister, something that has lingered throughout his career and something with which his name would become synonymous - racism. First, in July 2015, came a turning point for Sterling. Imagine being 20 years old and becoming the most expensive English player in history. That's what happened when Manchester City signed him for £49m on a five-year contract. City boss Manuel Pellegrini described Sterling as ""one of the best attacking players in world football"". It was the stuff of dreams. It was a huge and pivotal moment in his career. But with the signing came a wave of criticism. He was accused of being a money-grabber. His contract with Liverpool was worth £35,000 a week and he turned down an offer of £100,000 to stay, instead asking to leave. In an interview with BBC Sport, he said he ""talks about winning trophies"" rather than money. Liverpool’s last piece of silverware had been the League Cup in 2012. Their last league title? Four years before he was born.  While one newspaper accused him of being “greedy”, criticism wasn’t just coming from the press. Former Liverpool captain Steven Gerrard said he was “disappointed” with Sterling. And in May 2015, he was booed by some of his own fans after winning Liverpool’s Young Player of the Year award. The club’s former manager Graeme Souness said the supporters “would be entitled to turn on him”. Fiercely criticised for having the temerity to force through the move to Manchester City through his actions off the pitch, he was soon having to deal with the scourge of racism on it.  Manchester City reported the abuse as racist. Sterling said he ""had to laugh"" when he heard the remarks because he expects ""no better”. After all, this was nothing new. The previous year, 29-year-old Karl Anderson had been jailed for racially aggravated common assault after an “unprovoked” attack on Sterling outside City’s training ground. Police investigated the allegations relating to the Chelsea match, but the Crown Prosecution Service said there was insufficient evidence for a criminal charge. Chelsea conducted their own investigation and lip-reading experts concluded the abuse was racist. One Chelsea fan was banned for life, with five others banned for between one and two years for incidents at the same game. En route to training the day after the incident, Sterling pressed ‘post’.  He compared two Daily Mail articles about his Manchester City team-mates Phil Foden and Tosin Adarabioyo: “I am not normally the person to talk a lot but when I think I need my point to [be] heard I will speak up,” he wrote. The headline in the article about Adarabioyo, a black player, read: “Young Manchester City footballer, 20, on £25,000 a week splashes out on mansion on market for £2.25m despite having never started a Premier League match”. The headline on the article about Phil Foden, a white player, said: “Manchester City starlet Phil Foden buys new £2m home for his mum.” Sterling called the difference in treatment of Foden and Adarabioyo unacceptable. “This young black kid is looked at in a bad light. Which helps fuel racism and aggressive behaviour,” he said. “For all the newspapers that don’t understand why people are racist in this day and age, all I have to say is have a second thought about fair publicity and give all players an equal chance.” It was simple, but extremely powerful. And it sparked a national conversation about the media’s treatment of black players, and Sterling in particular.   The Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) made the link between press coverage of Sterling and racism in the stands, saying Sterling is ""often singled out"". ""While it may be true that no racial slurs have been used in the press coverage received by Raheem and others, we are in no doubt that the negative narrative influences public opinion and emboldens racist rhetoric,"" it said. Arsenal and England legend Ian Wright asked: ""How many people do you see get the criticism Sterling gets?"" ""They are picking on him because of the background he has come from and they want to keep him down, drag him back down. They don't want him to continue to be a success.” Clive Ellington, Sterling’s former mentor who identified his footballing ability as an eight-year-old, said the person he knew had “always been very humble, very focused on his football, and the media was painting a different picture of him this whole time”. Former England and Liverpool defender Jamie Carragher also spoke about the media’s coverage of Sterling, saying it “has racial undertones”. ""The perception is of a young, flash, black kid from London... The perception that he's more interested in cars, jewellery, night clubs than football,"" Carragher said. ""Anyone writing that, it's garbage. Raheem was a mouse. He wasn't on nights out, he was humble and trained very well.” But this wasn't just an issue at home.  In March 2019, England played Montenegro in Podgorica in a Euro 2020 qualifier, beating them 5-1. The Montenegro fans had been chanting racist abuse throughout the game and, in the 81st minute, Sterling scored the fifth goal and was subjected to yet more vitriol from the stands. He celebrated by cupping his hands to his ears, which he later said was a direct response to the abusers. And he called on football's authorities to take ""a proper stance"". ""The punishment should be, whatever nation it is, if your fans are chanting racist abuse then it should be the whole stadium so no-one can come and watch,” he told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""When the ban is lifted, the fans will think twice. They all love football, they all want to come and watch their nation so it will make them think twice before doing something silly like that."" Seven months later, another England qualifier - this time a 6-0 win in Sofia over Bulgaria - was overshadowed by racism that led to the game being stopped twice. In the 28thminute, Sterling was a target of the chanting that led to the game being halted for the first time. It was one of those moments so shocking that you remember where you were and who you were watching it with. He condemned the “idiots” afterwards. Once again, Sterling was making a stand. In June 2021, Sterling spoke to ITV about how the media portrays him. “Putting these perceptions in people’s brains, I just felt like that is something that can make people really dislike you,” he said. “You’ve got to speak up, and I think the most important thing is for players who follow us afterwards, to try to make it a lot easier for them.” Over the previous few years Sterling had, unwittingly or not, become a spokesman for racial equality. He was no longer speaking up just for himself. “It’s almost like he’d weathered the storm and he was playing the role of the big brother,” journalist Musa Okwonga, speaking about the Instagram post, told BBC Radio 5 Live’s Football Daily podcast. “That’s where the spokesman aspect comes in - he’s saying this isn’t just about me, it’s not my own grievance, it’s how are we treating this generation of footballers? Is this really appropriate, if we want England to flourish? “And that was so clever because it held up a mirror to the media’s treatment of Sterling and other black players in a way that had never happened before.” Sterling played that role again in 2019 when Juventus and Italy’s Leonardo Bonucci suggested that the racist abuse his team-mate Moise Kean received had been partly Kean’s fault. Kean, then 19, spread his arms while facing the crowd after scoring for Juve in a Serie A game. Bonucci said Kean ""could have done it differently"" and ""the blame is 50-50"". ""All you can do now is laugh,” said Sterling. In 2021, athletesspeaking out about racism and protesting against racial injusticeis the norm. In the summer of 2020, sportsmen and women all over the world joined the global conversation following the murder of unarmed black man George Floyd by a white police officer in Minneapolis. But in the context of Sterling’s story, it’s important to remember that when he called out the press for fuelling racism in December 2018, it was still a rarity for a footballer to speak about anything race-related. This wasn’t what footballers were supposed to do. His standing was underlined when he appeared on BBC TV’s Newsnight in June 2020 in the wake of George Floyd’s death, discussing how the incident related to life in the UK. Everybody in the country needed ""an equal chance”, he said, regardless of ethnicity. ""It’s been going on for hundreds of years and people are tired and people are ready for change,” he said. “But this is something that needs more than just talking. We need to actually implement change and highlight the places that do need changes."" And since footballers started taking a knee in 2020, Sterling has been a crucial voice in that conversation too.   Amid all of the abuse, vilification and negativity, Sterling was somehow putting all that aside when on the pitch. In 2017-18, he played a crucial role in Manchester City’s title win as they became the first team to register 100 points in a Premier League season. It was the first of three league titles he has won with City. The following season, he was instrumental in a domestic treble, as Pep Guardiola’s team won the Premier League, FA Cup and Carabao Cup. The 24-year-old also won the PFA Young Player of the Year award, as well as the Football Writers’ Association’s Footballer of the Year award. Under the guidance of manager Guardiola, he cemented his place as one of Europe’s premier attacking players. He has reached double figures for goals in each of the past four Premier League seasons, and has surpassed 100 career goals in all competitions. With the potential to play for another decade at the highest level, he has already amassed 96 Premier League goals, putting him 32ndon the all-time list. It would be surprising if he doesn't finish in the top 10. But through it all, there has been a constant sense that he is not appreciated at international level in the way he is by his club’s supporters. Until now.    Sterling was involved in 15 of England’s 37 goals in qualifying for Euro 2020 and yet, after a relatively disappointing season at club level when he was left out of some key games, his place in Gareth Southgate’s side for Euro 2020 was the subject of much debate before the tournament. But if there was doubt, there was certainly no self-doubt. The perfect illustration came when he was asked, having scored England’s only goal in the opening 1-0 win over Croatia, whether he had justified his inclusion. His reaction, a raise of the eyebrows and a slight tilting of the head, said more than any words could. Less than a month on, he stands on the cusp of greatness. Goals against the Czech Republic and Germany have followed, and he produced a stand-out performance, growing stronger with each passing minute, as England overcame Denmark in the semi-finals. It was he who won the penalty which decided the game, although perhaps inevitably even that brought with it controversy, with accusations that he had dived. Now, as the European Championship final with Italy beckons, Sterling has history within his grasp. He has a strong case to be considered player of the tournament, a feat which would be remembered for generations as England aim to end a 55-year wait for a major trophy. He has been helped, he says, by “Wembley magic”, and has spoken of how the “support and energy from all the fans have been incredible both at Wembley, and from everyone watching at home”. His has been – and continues to be – a turbulent story. But on Sunday, a few minutes from his childhood home, could he write the most glorious chapter, one he dreamed about as a boy?

"Lebanon plunged into darkness as power plants shutMany in Lebanon are receiving just two hours of energy a day, as it grapples with an economic crisis.Middle East","Lebanon's financial crisis has led to acute electricity shortages, and many rely on private generators Lebanon's two main power plants were switched off on Friday, plunging much of the country into a near-total blackout. The shutdown - caused by the two plants running out of fuel - worsens a crisis that has seen people receive just two hours of electricity a day. A lack of foreign currency has made it hard to pay overseas energy suppliers. Pharmacies have also gone on strike over medicine shortages caused by the failure to pay foreign importers. Lebanon's two biggest power stations, Deir Ammar and Zahrani - which together provide about 40% of the country's electricity - shut down on Friday, their owner Electricite Du Liban (EDL) said. Ships loaded with gas oil had refused to offload the fuel before money was transferred to their owners' accounts in dollars. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In the eastern city of Zahle, EDL asked residents to reduce their consumption to a minimum, saying the ""power supply has been cut across Lebanese territories indefinitely"". As the BBC's Sebastian Usher notes, swathes of the country are now facing water rationing as well. The pumping stations are powered by diesel, and lack the supplies they need to function. Lebanon has suffered a severe economic crisis over the past 18 months, and its currency - the Lebanese Pound - has collapsed to record lows. Some local healthcare companieshave already run out of medicines needed to treat cancer and heart disease. Lebanon: Why the country is in crisis Pharmacies closed their doors on Friday in protest at the shortages. The association of pharmacy owners announced a ""general open-ended strike across Lebanon"", claiming 80% of stores in the capital Beirut were shut. This video can not be played Six-year-old Sedra is one of the people whose lives have been put at risk by Lebanon's energy crisis The failing economy has left half the population living in poverty and prompted mass protests, demanding the removal of a political elite accused of corruption and negligence. Carine Torbey, BBC News, Beirut Power cuts are not unusual in Lebanon - the country hasn't had 24/7 electricity for decades. State-generated power was rationed, and people filled in the gaps by plugging in to a parallel system of private generators. Today, it wasn't just a gap. For the first time, the entire grid went offline, and the private generators became the only source of power. But they too are under pressure. They run on diesel, which is hard to find, and they simply don't have the capacity to completely replace state electricity. On top of this, they have become very expensive, and thus unaffordable for a lot of people. This means that most people in Lebanon are currently facing long hours of total blackout. Lebanon is currently facing financial and economic collapse. It's hard for the people here to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Literally.

How many people are deleting the Covid app?,"The government has suggested that the NHS Covid contact tracing app may need to change after Covid restrictions were lifted in England on 19 July. The requirement to self-isolate for those who have been fully vaccinated, if they come into contact with someone who tests positive, is also being lifted but not until 16 August. Between those dates, more than four-and-a-half million people could be ""pinged"",according to BBC analysis. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps was asked on BBC Radio 4's Today programme whether people who have booked holidays, for example, might choose instead to delete the app or ignore it. ""We're still seeing large numbers of people downloading the app,"" Mr Shapps insisted. So, what do the figures show? There was a huge number of downloads when the app was released last autumn, with 18 million in just over a month (not shown in the chart below). The app is available to download in England and Wales. The downloads slowed after that, but picked up again in April 2021. In the most recent week for whichwe have figures,,externalthe second week of July 2021, there were 302,895 downloads - around 40,000 down on the week before. The total number of downloads in England and Wales is more than 26.8 million. But remember that is a measure of downloads, not necessarily people, and some of those who downloaded the app have since deleted it. We also don't know how many people have switched phones or reset their phones and downloaded it a second time. NHS Covid app may change as rules change, Grant Shapps says I'm fully vaccinated, but how can I prove it? What are the self-isolation rules if I'm fully vaccinated? Prof Henry Potts, from University College London, told BBC News: ""We have seen steadily rising numbers of people deleting the app."" He is part of theCorsair study,,externalwhich is a series of surveys commissioned by the Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC). About 2,000 people at a time were asked questions. Around 1,600 had a smartphone and were asked about their use of the Covid app. In surveys in November and December 2020, between 5% and 7% of those who had downloaded it said they had since deleted it In May and June 2021, that figure increased to between 8% and 11%. Note that these are preliminary results that have not yet been peer reviewed for publication. Also, while people might still have the app on their phones, they may have the contact tracing function switched off. We asked DHSC for the number of people who had deleted the app but the department said there was no reliable figure, because it would be based only on the people who had opted to share their data. Dr Jenny Harries, the head of the new UK Health Security Agency, told MPs on Thursday she was ""aware that people are choosing not to use the app"" when asked about concerns people have been deleting it to avoid being ""pinged"". Jamie (not their real name) is currently isolating after being told to by the app. ""Since being told to self-isolate I have been chastised by friends who I've had to cancel plans with, and my boss told me to switch the app off. ""Other colleagues told me they just ignored the app when they were told to self-isolate. ""I feel like I'm being punished for following the rules and it's not clear whether I am lawfully required to not go to work, or whether I should just ignore the app instead of risking losing my job."" We know that recently the number of alerts sent to app users telling them to isolate has been increasing rapidly. But that is no great surprise, because we know that the number of infections has also been rising fast. The latest infection survey,externalfrom the Office for National Statistics suggests that about 741,700 people in England would test positive in the week to 17 July, up from 577,700 people in the previous week. What happens if I'm 'pinged' by the app? Contact tracing is not the only function of the app - it also allows users to check into venues that they are visiting. The latest weekly figures show that the number of check-ins is down about two million from the peak in early June, despite the attraction of pubs showing the Euro 2020 football tournament.

'My music is always there when I need it',"Paul Holland's favourite Black Sabbath album takes pride of place Paul Holland has seen some upheavals in his life over the past year, but his music collection of vinyl albums and CDs has helped him to get through tough times. ""It's been massively important,"" the 35-year-old from Bracknell in Berkshire told the BBC. ""It's always there, always accessible when you need it. That's why I like having physical copies."" Paul's collection actually straddles two continents at the moment - he has about 100 albums in the UK, but the rest are in Portland, Oregon. That's because, after living in the US since 2015, he moved back last year, at the height of the pandemic, following the breakdown of his marriage to an American woman. ""We're still in touch, but it didn't work out,"" he says, adding that his ex-wife is still taking good care of his records. Paul is one of many BBC News website readers who got in touch with us following the news thatsupermarket giant Sainsbury's has decided to stop selling CDs and DVDs. Although streaming has replaced buying records for many people, others would never part with their collections and are still adding to them whenever they can. ""I can't imagine a world where media is not in your hands and not yours. Films, albums and TV shows are removed from streaming services all the time,"" says Paul. He has a varied selection of albums, including Otis Redding and David Bowie, but also ""a lot of rock and heavy metal"". His favourite album is Black Sabbath's first: ""It's got the heavy bits if you want to shake your head, but also quieter songs as well - there's a bit of light and shade."" Some music collectors have quite specialised tastes. Kathryn Kyle, 29, from Carlisle, loves buying CDs and DVDs, but by just one artist, a Japanese rock band called D. Kathryn Kyle is busy buying up D's extensive back catalogue That means she scours the internet for import releases, which she buys from Japanese websites or from online fan communities. ""Though my family and colleagues don't understand the draw to these physical copies, I love the way CDs look, and I love opening them up, reading the leaflet and pamphlets inside,"" she told the BBC. ""It's an expensive hobby, for sure, but I can't help that feel that something could go wrong with digital services and having something physical is a reliable back-up."" Kathryn, who works in a building society, says she got into the band through listening to the music from Japanese video games and anime films. ""I've just moved house and I've bought a bookshelf for my CDs,"" she says. But she adds that her housemate doesn't share her musical tastes. ""She's into vinyl and she listens to country music. Frankly, I would rather cut my ears off!"" Retired market researcher Leslie Sopp, 68, of Brill in Buckinghamshire, has let go of his old vinyl albums, but still has a collection of 850 CDs to which he adds regularly. ""My son took over the vinyl mantle,"" he told the BBC. ""He works in the music industry, so he cherry-picked my records with my permission. ""CD has given me a real benefit, because it allowed me to downsize the volume while maintaining a physical collection."" Leslie Sopp finds CDs more practical but misses LPs Even so, he admits that he misses the artwork and lyric sheets that come with LPs: ""I can't read lyrics on CD inserts."" Leslie says his collection contains ""smatterings of everything"", but his main interests are electronica, ambient and above all jazz, with a special fondness for Keith Jarrett and other artists on the ECM label. However, he also listens to music digitally with a Spotify account and buys new CDs after checking them out on the streaming service. ""Storage is an issue,"" he says. ""I have one big piece of furniture to hold them and the rest are in plastic storeaway boxes. ""It's all out of sight, but I've got it all on a spreadsheet, so I know where everything is."" However, not all music fans believe in owning physical copies of their favourite tunes. And whereas you might think that younger people prefer streaming and older listeners want CDs or vinyl, that's not always the case. ""I am passionate about vinyl. I loathe it with a passion,"" says Tony Neal, a 69-year-old civil servant from Fareham in Hampshire. Tony Neal keeps his records in the loft ""I spent a small fortune in the 1970s building a top-end hi-fi system to play my records and the quality was impressive, but there was always that click and crackle to spoil the experience,"" he told the BBC. ""The gear is still in the loft, never to be used again, along with the records that now sound so much better when streamed. I am now fully digital."" These days, Tony has Bluetooth speakers scattered around the house and listens to his music on Spotify. He says that getting involved with sound recording for amateur dramatic productions has taught him to be ""picky"" about what he listens to. ""It's been years since I last bought a CD and playing old vinyl is a pain,"" he says. ""Streaming is so much more convenient and the quality is so much better. ""I've heard things listening to streaming on headphones that I've never heard on the original recordings back in the 1960s and 1970s. It's the clarity and depth of the stream.""

Covid app settings changing to send fewer alerts,"The NHS Covid-19 app will be altered to send out fewer isolation alerts, the BBC has learned. The team behind the contact tracing app for England and Wales has been told to adjust the measurements which trigger the alerts, a source has confirmed. The time frame for the change is not yet known. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps had suggested that the app might need to change for the planned lifting of restrictions in England on 19 July. The app has so far been downloaded nearly 26m times in England and Wales. But businesses and individuals have raised concerns that too many people were being advised to self-isolate for up to 10 days, following close contact with a device that later reported a positive Covid test result. A requirement to self-isolate if people have had both vaccine doses will only stop on 16 August, raising fears that millions would be asked to self-isolate this summer as they mixed more after 19 July, and cases rise. The UK is experiencinga marked increase in Covid infections, according to the Office for National Statistics, with the latest data suggesting one in every 160 people has the virus. That is up from one in every 250 in the previous week and an estimated 400,000 people are thought to have been positive in the week to 3 July. Keep using NHS Covid app people urged How many people are deleting the Covid app? ""Things are moving fast,"" said the source at the app team. The Department of Health and Social Care said the app was doing ""exactly what it was designed to do"". The app user's phone detects others that are around it, using bluetooth. People who later test positive for Covid can anonymously share their test result, triggering alerts for all those flagged as close contacts in the days before the test. Currently this is devices at a distance of 2m or less, for a minimum of 15 minutes during a 24 hour period. This formula has been tweaked several times since the app launched in September 2020, and additional variables have also been factored in as more has been learned about the infectious nature of the virus. It is these parameters which are to be adjusted, and the source said the changes could be made very quickly. However, Labour leader Sir Kier Starmer has expressed concerns about making the changes as case numbers increase. ""This feels like taking the batteries out of the smoke detector and that is never a good idea,"" he said. In the week of the 30 June some 356,000 alerts were triggered following the input of 61,000 positive Covid tests - an average of about six isolation requests per case. The isolation alerts are not legally enforceable - unlike the requirement to isolate if you are contacted directly by NHS Test and Trace. ""The app is, and has always been, advisory,"" said the Department of Health in a statement. ""In the context of rising cases it is vital people are aware of their personal risk so they can make informed decisions on their behaviour to protect those around them."" Downing Street said the app had been an ""important tool"" and people should continue using it and isolate when asked to do so. The NHS Covid-19 app is used in England and Wales. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own powers to set coronavirus regulations andseparate test-and-trace programmes. The Welsh government has saidpeople in Wales should continue to use the app even if social distancing rules in Wales differ from those in England. How many people are deleting the Covid app?

Normal lads chasing dreams - Kane,"This video can not be played Harry Kane's winner sends England to Euro 2020 final Harry Kane says England have bonded with the public by being ""normal lads"" who hope to fulfil childhood dreams in ""the biggest game of all our careers"". Captain Kane could lift England's first trophy in 55 years if they beat Italy to win Euro 2020 at Wembley on Sunday. The possibility has seen his name referenced alongside 1966 World Cup-winning captain Bobby Moore. ""Whenever your name is mentioned in company like that, it gives motivation and confidence,"" Kane told BBC Sport. ""I think it's the biggest game in my career so far and probably the biggest game of all of our careers so far. ""You dream of these moments as a kid - lifting trophies for your country. And we have that opportunity now. ""These are the opportunities you have to grab with both hands."" 'My dream finish for England - Shearer '25 hour days' - Southgate by those who know him Pick your England XI against Italy England's success in the championship has followed positive headlines featuring a number of the squad's players. Striker Marcus Rashford has won praise for assisting a number of good causes, while forward Raheem Sterling willreceive an MBE for his services to racial equality in sport. Midfielder Jordan Henderson helped orchestrate financial support for good causes from Premier League players during the coronavirus pandemic and England's players have already said theywill donate a chunk of their prize money from the Euros to National Health Service. Speaking to BBC sports editor Dan Roan, Tottenham striker Kane added: ""I think we've shown that were just normal, normal lads. ""We know that the ultimate goal is to finish the job now. But yeah, for sure everyone should be proud of the way they've represented themselves and obviously their friends and family across across the country."" Italy have won their last 14 fixtures - conceding just twice in normal time - and Kane admits the four-time World Cup winners will prove ""tough"" opponents. Central defender John Stones says England have been motivated by scenes of celebration on social media in recent days and - like his captain - is aware of how fans dream of being in the players' position. ""It's difficult to put into words,"" the Manchester City defender said. ""We have definitely thrived off the fans. ""I suppose we are living their dream, right at the front , out on the pitch. We can't thank them enough for all their support through the tough times and the good. ""The support is deeply appreciated by us as players. We are proud to represent them, the country and we hope we do them proud on Sunday."" Stones moved to praise manager Gareth Southgate, highlighting his ""calmness"", a quality he says then ""passes through the team"". This video can not be played Euro 2020: Lineker, Shearer & Jenas discuss the Raheem Sterling penalty incident He also explained he hopes Sterling can go on to be named player of the tournament. His Manchester City team-mate has delivered superb displays and scored three times in England's passage to the final. His fine form follows a season during which he opened up about facing racist abuse on social media and where his place in the England starting line-up was questioned. ""I couldn't be happier for him,"" said Stones. ""He's gone through some difficult times personally. You can see it's motivated him and he's come out the other end a better player. That's what top players do, they find something, a way to excel as a person and a player. ""He has done that on and off the pitch. He really deserves it."" Southgate knows he is one win away from joining the late Sir Alf Ramsey - England manager in 1966 - as the only men to guide their country to major honours. The 50-year-old has highlighted Italy's 33-match unbeaten run as evidence of the test his side face in only the second major final in England's history. ""We can win it, but we've got to get it spot on to win it,"" said Southgate. ""I said to the players yesterday, people are respecting how they've been and that they've represented the country in the right way, but now they have a choice of what colour medal. ""We know the size of the challenge, but what a brilliant challenge for us to have and what a brilliant opportunity for the players to write one more piece of history. ""I know it won't be enough for me and for the rest of the staff and for the players if we don't win it now.""

Lebanon plunged into darkness as power plants shut,"Lebanon's financial crisis has led to acute electricity shortages, and many rely on private generators Lebanon's two main power plants were switched off on Friday, plunging much of the country into a near-total blackout. The shutdown - caused by the two plants running out of fuel - worsens a crisis that has seen people receive just two hours of electricity a day. A lack of foreign currency has made it hard to pay overseas energy suppliers. Pharmacies have also gone on strike over medicine shortages caused by the failure to pay foreign importers. Lebanon's two biggest power stations, Deir Ammar and Zahrani - which together provide about 40% of the country's electricity - shut down on Friday, their owner Electricite Du Liban (EDL) said. Ships loaded with gas oil had refused to offload the fuel before money was transferred to their owners' accounts in dollars. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In the eastern city of Zahle, EDL asked residents to reduce their consumption to a minimum, saying the ""power supply has been cut across Lebanese territories indefinitely"". As the BBC's Sebastian Usher notes, swathes of the country are now facing water rationing as well. The pumping stations are powered by diesel, and lack the supplies they need to function. Lebanon has suffered a severe economic crisis over the past 18 months, and its currency - the Lebanese Pound - has collapsed to record lows. Some local healthcare companieshave already run out of medicines needed to treat cancer and heart disease. Lebanon: Why the country is in crisis Pharmacies closed their doors on Friday in protest at the shortages. The association of pharmacy owners announced a ""general open-ended strike across Lebanon"", claiming 80% of stores in the capital Beirut were shut. This video can not be played Six-year-old Sedra is one of the people whose lives have been put at risk by Lebanon's energy crisis The failing economy has left half the population living in poverty and prompted mass protests, demanding the removal of a political elite accused of corruption and negligence. Carine Torbey, BBC News, Beirut Power cuts are not unusual in Lebanon - the country hasn't had 24/7 electricity for decades. State-generated power was rationed, and people filled in the gaps by plugging in to a parallel system of private generators. Today, it wasn't just a gap. For the first time, the entire grid went offline, and the private generators became the only source of power. But they too are under pressure. They run on diesel, which is hard to find, and they simply don't have the capacity to completely replace state electricity. On top of this, they have become very expensive, and thus unaffordable for a lot of people. This means that most people in Lebanon are currently facing long hours of total blackout. Lebanon is currently facing financial and economic collapse. It's hard for the people here to see the light at the end of the tunnel. Literally.

'Use Covid app in Wales' despite England changes,"The app is an important part of controlling the spread of Covid, the Welsh government says People in Wales should still use the NHS Covid-19 app even if social distancing rules differ from England, the Welsh government has said. The UK Transport Secretary Grant Shapps saidchanges to the app could be made, with England set to scrap its lockdown rules on 19 July. The app also covers Wales, where a similar date has not been given. The Welsh government said it was working to ensure any changes to the app align with policies in Wales. Q&A: What are Wales' lockdown rules? Why rising Covid rates may not mean lockdown Doctors call for face masks to stay in healthcare The app detects the distance between smartphone users and the length of time spent in close proximity - currently 2m or less and for more than 15 minutes. It allows people who test positive to anonymously share their test result, triggering alerts for those detected as close contacts in the days before the test. Those who are alerted then have to self-isolate. This video can not be played Grant Shapps: ""As our restrictions change, the NHS app needs to change in line"" But under plans in England, 1m-plus social distancing rules would be scrapped and the app's sensitivity reduced. Any changes to Wales' Covid rules will be announced on 15 July. Covid lockdown rules have often differed in the UK nations during the course of the pandemic, with face masks in shops made mandatory in England before Wales, while Wales entered autumn and winter lockdowns earlier than elsewhere. On Tuesday, Wales' Health Minister Eluned Morgan saidthe country was going to have to ""learn to live with coronavirus""but the Welsh government would not move to a ""political deadline that has been set out artificially"" across the border. The Welsh government said on Friday: ""We are working closely with the UK government on potential changes to the NHS Covid app to ensure it aligns with Welsh policies. ""People in Wales are encouraged to download and use the NHS Covid-19 app. ""It's an important part of our Test, Trace, Protect programme to control the spread of Covid-19.""

Doctors call for face masks to stay in healthcareThe head of a doctors' group says it is important to keep face coverings in the healthcare sector.Wales,"Dr David Bailey said removing all rules on face coverings would be wrong for healthcare settings Face masks should still be used in healthcare settings, even if restrictions are eased elsewhere, the head of a doctors' group has said. The Welsh government is under pressure from some after Boris Johnson saidEnglish restrictions could end in July. British Medical Association Wales chairman, Dr David Bailey, said removing all rules would be the ""wrong way to go"" for healthcare settings. He called for ""flexibility"" over future face mask rules. Dr Bailey, a GP in Caerphilly, said he would continue to wear a mask in the supermarket and on public transport, but there was not a necessity to wear them outside. Dr Bailey said there were more clinically vulnerable and sick people in healthcare settings He said: ""I don't think we need to be perhaps quite as worried about it as we were six months ago because most of us are vaccinated and because there's much less likelihood of getting ill. ""So I think there does need to be a bit of flexibility and it looks likely that it won't be mandatory in the future."" Wales will have to adapt to Covid, minister says Why rising Covid rates may not mean lockdown Wales considering amber list vaccination plan Dr Bailey added that it was ""reasonable"" to reduce the amount of social distancing, but rejected a complete relaxation of the rules. The Welsh government will announce any changes to Covid rules at its next review on 15 July. ""I think we would certainly strongly suggest that would be the wrong way to go in healthcare settings,"" he said. ""It's important, I think, to make sure that in healthcare settings we do try and continue to use face coverings."" Concerns have been raised about potential different rules in England and Wales, particularly by businesses on the border. ""Face masks shouldn't cause any problem at all on the borders,"" he said, urging the Welsh government to be ""sensible and cautious"". Dr Bailey added: ""The things that don't actually impact on getting on with your life, why not do them anyway? ""They've been proven to help and there is still a lot of Covid in the community."" Wales' overall case rate has been increasing and was at 117 cases per 100,000 people on Thursday, which is still lower than all other UK nations and English regions. There has been a slight rise in the average number of patients with confirmed Covid in hospital beds. However, hospital admissions for patients with confirmed and suspected Covid remain low - a daily average of seven, which is 0.6% of all hospital admissions. GPs themselves have been starting to see more patients with Covid symptoms. The consultation rate - which has been one of the wider measures used by health officials to assess the progress of Covid - has risen to a level not seen since March, according to the most recent Public Health Wales figures.

"Water firm fined Â£90m for deliberate sewage spillsThe company admits 6,971 illegal spills at 17 treatment works in Kent, Hampshire and West Sussex.Kent","Southern Water illegally dumped untreated water at 17 sites, including Bosham, West Sussex Southern Water has been fined a record Â£90m for deliberately dumping billions of litres of raw sewage into the sea. The company admitted 6,971 illegal spills from 17 sites in Hampshire, Kent and West Sussex between 2010 and 2015. His Honour Mr Justice Jeremy Johnson said the offences had been ""committed deliberately"" by Southern Water's board of directors at the time. Lawyers for the company had told Canterbury Crown Court the spills were the result of ""negligence"". The offences were discovered as part of the Environment Agency's largest ever criminal investigation, which began after shellfish were found to be contaminated with E. coli. Raw sewage had been diverted away from treatment works and into the environment, allowing the company to avoid financial penalties and the costs of upkeep and upgrades, the court heard. Mr Justice Johnson said Southern Water ""showed a shocking and wholesale disregard for the environment, for the precious and delicate ecosystems along the north Kent and Solent coastlines, to human health and to the fisheries and other legitimate businesses that depend on the vitality of the coastal waters"". The total volume of untreated sewage dumped into the environment was estimated between 16 to 21 billion litres, or 7,400 Olympic-sized swimming pools, the court heard. In Bedhampton Creek, in Havant, Hampshire, anglers reported finding sanitary towels, condoms and tissues in the water, along with a strong smell of sewage, the court heard. Residents in Swalecliffe, Kent, said discharges from the sewage works were ""occurring events"", the court heard. The company illegally discharged raw sewage into the environment in Swalecliffe, Kent The ""sheer scale"" of offending meant it was ""inherently unlikely this was due to a small number of rogue employees"". ""It is far more likely to be due to deliberate disregard for the law from the top down,"" the judge said. The offences had been aggravated by Southern Water's ""persistent pollution of the environment"" which had led to 168 previous convictions and cautions, he said. He said the scale of the fine was intended to ""bring home to the management of this and other companies the need to comply with laws that are designed to protect the environment"". It is the largest sentence issued by a court after an Environment Agency investigation, exceedinga Â£20m fine received by Thames Water in 2017. In March 2020, Southern Water admitted 51 counts at Maidstone Crown Court, covering discharges of untreated sewage from sites in: Eastchurch on the Isle of Sheppey, Kent Slowhill Copse in Marchwood, Hampshire Beaulieu, Hampshire Millbrook, Hampshire Budds Farm in Havant, Hampshire Swalecliffe, Kent Queenborough, Kent Sittingbourne, Kent Teynham, Kent Herne Bay, Kent Ashlett Creek, Fawley, Hampshire Bosham, West Sussex Chichester, West Sussex Portswood in Southampton, Hampshire Thornham in Emsworth, Hampshire Woolston in Southampton, Hampshire Diamond Road, Whitstable, Kent During periods of heavy rain, water companies are permitted to divert untreated waste water away from treatment plants, discharging sewage straight into the environment to prevent sewers backing up. However, the Environment Agency found that on thousands of occasions untreated sewage had left Southern Water sites through this route during periods of lower rainfall. Directing sewage straight into rivers and seas improved the quality of treated water leaving the works, which is regularly tested and can lead to heavy fines if standards fall, the court heard. Mr Justice Johnson said the offences had been motivated by a desire to ""focus the company's attention on those metrics that increase its income, disregarding its wider compliance obligations"". Chief executive Ian McAulay, who was appointed in 2017, was in court on Friday alongside chairman Keith Lough, who joined in 2019. After the hearing, Mr McAulay said: ""We have heard what the judge has said today and will reflect closely on the sentence and his remarks. ""He has rightly put the environment front and centre which is what matters to all of us. "" Mr McAulay said the fine would not affect customers' bills or infrastructure investments, with shareholders due to bear the cost.

Covid app settings changing to send fewer alertsAlterations to take place amid fears that millions would be asked to isolate as people mixed more.Technology,"The NHS Covid-19 app will be altered to send out fewer isolation alerts, the BBC has learned. The team behind the contact tracing app for England and Wales has been told to adjust the measurements which trigger the alerts, a source has confirmed. The time frame for the change is not yet known. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps had suggested that the app might need to change for the planned lifting of restrictions in England on 19 July. The app has so far been downloaded nearly 26m times in England and Wales. But businesses and individuals have raised concerns that too many people were being advised to self-isolate for up to 10 days, following close contact with a device that later reported a positive Covid test result. A requirement to self-isolate if people have had both vaccine doses will only stop on 16 August, raising fears that millions would be asked to self-isolate this summer as they mixed more after 19 July, and cases rise. The UK is experiencinga marked increase in Covid infections, according to the Office for National Statistics, with the latest data suggesting one in every 160 people has the virus. That is up from one in every 250 in the previous week and an estimated 400,000 people are thought to have been positive in the week to 3 July. Keep using NHS Covid app people urged How many people are deleting the Covid app? ""Things are moving fast,"" said the source at the app team. The Department of Health and Social Care said the app was doing ""exactly what it was designed to do"". The app user's phone detects others that are around it, using bluetooth. People who later test positive for Covid can anonymously share their test result, triggering alerts for all those flagged as close contacts in the days before the test. Currently this is devices at a distance of 2m or less, for a minimum of 15 minutes during a 24 hour period. This formula has been tweaked several times since the app launched in September 2020, and additional variables have also been factored in as more has been learned about the infectious nature of the virus. It is these parameters which are to be adjusted, and the source said the changes could be made very quickly. However, Labour leader Sir Kier Starmer has expressed concerns about making the changes as case numbers increase. ""This feels like taking the batteries out of the smoke detector and that is never a good idea,"" he said. In the week of the 30 June some 356,000 alerts were triggered following the input of 61,000 positive Covid tests - an average of about six isolation requests per case. The isolation alerts are not legally enforceable - unlike the requirement to isolate if you are contacted directly by NHS Test and Trace. ""The app is, and has always been, advisory,"" said the Department of Health in a statement. ""In the context of rising cases it is vital people are aware of their personal risk so they can make informed decisions on their behaviour to protect those around them."" Downing Street said the app had been an ""important tool"" and people should continue using it and isolate when asked to do so. The NHS Covid-19 app is used in England and Wales. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own powers to set coronavirus regulations andseparate test-and-trace programmes. The Welsh government has saidpeople in Wales should continue to use the app even if social distancing rules in Wales differ from those in England. How many people are deleting the Covid app?

"Covid jabs very effective for shielders, data saysA study of more than a million people shows those with other conditions get high protection from two doses.Health","Covid vaccines are highly effective in people with underlying health conditions who were advised to shield earlier in the pandemic, real-world UK data reveals. The study,externalof more than a million people in at-risk groups shows two doses of the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines are needed for this protection. Being double-jabbed reduced the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 by around 90%. One dose cut it by about 60%, says Public Health England (PHE). Covid-19: People share feelings on end of shielding Shielding teenager goes back to school after 450 days It takes a couple of weeks for the protection offered by a second to kick in. Protection against hospitalisation and death in at-risk groups is expected to be greater than protection against symptomatic disease, as has been seen in studies of the general population, although more data is needed to confirm this. The preprint study findings also cover a time period when the Alpha, or UK, coronavirus variant was dominant, rather than the Delta one, which is behind most infections occurring now. But experts are increasingly confident that existing vaccines still work well against Delta. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at PHE, said: ""This real-world data shows for the first time that most people who are clinically vulnerable to Covid-19 still receive high levels of protection after two doses of vaccine. ""It is vital that anyone with an underlying condition gets both doses, especially people with weakened immune systems as they gain so much more benefit from the second dose."" In the study, one dose of vaccine was, on average, only 4% effective in people with weakened immune systems. Efficacy increased to 74%, however, after two doses. The charityBlood Cancer UK,externalsays much more data is needed to assess vaccine efficacy in different groups of people who are immunocompromised. Chief Executive Gemma Peters said: ""The study states that vaccine response is lower in the immunocompromised, and there are too few immunocompromised people to draw confident conclusions. Also, there are a wide range of health conditions that weaken people's immune systems, and it is unhelpful to make generalised conclusions. ""Our advice to people with blood cancer remains the same.

"Normal lads chasing dreams - KaneEngland captain Harry Kane on Italy, childhood dreams and Bobby Moore.BBC Sport","This video can not be played Harry Kane's winner sends England to Euro 2020 final Harry Kane says England have bonded with the public by being ""normal lads"" who hope to fulfil childhood dreams in ""the biggest game of all our careers"". Captain Kane could lift England's first trophy in 55 years if they beat Italy to win Euro 2020 at Wembley on Sunday. The possibility has seen his name referenced alongside 1966 World Cup-winning captain Bobby Moore. ""Whenever your name is mentioned in company like that, it gives motivation and confidence,"" Kane told BBC Sport. ""I think it's the biggest game in my career so far and probably the biggest game of all of our careers so far. ""You dream of these moments as a kid - lifting trophies for your country. And we have that opportunity now. ""These are the opportunities you have to grab with both hands."" 'My dream finish for England - Shearer '25 hour days' - Southgate by those who know him Pick your England XI against Italy England's success in the championship has followed positive headlines featuring a number of the squad's players. Striker Marcus Rashford has won praise for assisting a number of good causes, while forward Raheem Sterling willreceive an MBE for his services to racial equality in sport. Midfielder Jordan Henderson helped orchestrate financial support for good causes from Premier League players during the coronavirus pandemic and England's players have already said theywill donate a chunk of their prize money from the Euros to National Health Service. Speaking to BBC sports editor Dan Roan, Tottenham striker Kane added: ""I think we've shown that were just normal, normal lads. ""We know that the ultimate goal is to finish the job now. But yeah, for sure everyone should be proud of the way they've represented themselves and obviously their friends and family across across the country."" Italy have won their last 14 fixtures - conceding just twice in normal time - and Kane admits the four-time World Cup winners will prove ""tough"" opponents. Central defender John Stones says England have been motivated by scenes of celebration on social media in recent days and - like his captain - is aware of how fans dream of being in the players' position. ""It's difficult to put into words,"" the Manchester City defender said. ""We have definitely thrived off the fans. ""I suppose we are living their dream, right at the front , out on the pitch. We can't thank them enough for all their support through the tough times and the good. ""The support is deeply appreciated by us as players. We are proud to represent them, the country and we hope we do them proud on Sunday."" Stones moved to praise manager Gareth Southgate, highlighting his ""calmness"", a quality he says then ""passes through the team"". This video can not be played Euro 2020: Lineker, Shearer & Jenas discuss the Raheem Sterling penalty incident He also explained he hopes Sterling can go on to be named player of the tournament. His Manchester City team-mate has delivered superb displays and scored three times in England's passage to the final. His fine form follows a season during which he opened up about facing racist abuse on social media and where his place in the England starting line-up was questioned. ""I couldn't be happier for him,"" said Stones. ""He's gone through some difficult times personally. You can see it's motivated him and he's come out the other end a better player. That's what top players do, they find something, a way to excel as a person and a player. ""He has done that on and off the pitch. He really deserves it."" Southgate knows he is one win away from joining the late Sir Alf Ramsey - England manager in 1966 - as the only men to guide their country to major honours. The 50-year-old has highlighted Italy's 33-match unbeaten run as evidence of the test his side face in only the second major final in England's history. ""We can win it, but we've got to get it spot on to win it,"" said Southgate. ""I said to the players yesterday, people are respecting how they've been and that they've represented the country in the right way, but now they have a choice of what colour medal. ""We know the size of the challenge, but what a brilliant challenge for us to have and what a brilliant opportunity for the players to write one more piece of history. ""I know it won't be enough for me and for the rest of the staff and for the players if we don't win it now.""

"Water firm fined Â£90m for deliberate sewage spillsThe company admits 6,971 illegal spills at 17 treatment works in Kent, Hampshire and West Sussex.","Southern Water illegally dumped untreated water at 17 sites, including Bosham, West Sussex Southern Water has been fined a record Â£90m for deliberately dumping billions of litres of raw sewage into the sea. The company admitted 6,971 illegal spills from 17 sites in Hampshire, Kent and West Sussex between 2010 and 2015. His Honour Mr Justice Jeremy Johnson said the offences had been ""committed deliberately"" by Southern Water's board of directors at the time. Lawyers for the company had told Canterbury Crown Court the spills were the result of ""negligence"". The offences were discovered as part of the Environment Agency's largest ever criminal investigation, which began after shellfish were found to be contaminated with E. coli. Raw sewage had been diverted away from treatment works and into the environment, allowing the company to avoid financial penalties and the costs of upkeep and upgrades, the court heard. Mr Justice Johnson said Southern Water ""showed a shocking and wholesale disregard for the environment, for the precious and delicate ecosystems along the north Kent and Solent coastlines, to human health and to the fisheries and other legitimate businesses that depend on the vitality of the coastal waters"". The total volume of untreated sewage dumped into the environment was estimated between 16 to 21 billion litres, or 7,400 Olympic-sized swimming pools, the court heard. In Bedhampton Creek, in Havant, Hampshire, anglers reported finding sanitary towels, condoms and tissues in the water, along with a strong smell of sewage, the court heard. Residents in Swalecliffe, Kent, said discharges from the sewage works were ""occurring events"", the court heard. The company illegally discharged raw sewage into the environment in Swalecliffe, Kent The ""sheer scale"" of offending meant it was ""inherently unlikely this was due to a small number of rogue employees"". ""It is far more likely to be due to deliberate disregard for the law from the top down,"" the judge said. The offences had been aggravated by Southern Water's ""persistent pollution of the environment"" which had led to 168 previous convictions and cautions, he said. He said the scale of the fine was intended to ""bring home to the management of this and other companies the need to comply with laws that are designed to protect the environment"".

Calls grow for extra bank holiday if England winFirms are also being asked to be flexible by allowing staff to start work later on Monday if possible.,"Prime minister Boris Johnson is coming under pressure to give workers a one-off bank holiday if England win their final Euro 2020 championship on Sunday. Apetition on the Parliament website,externalpassed 320,000 signatures on Friday. It says an extra day off would help families to watch the match together. Mr Johnson said granting a bank holiday now would be ""tempting fate"". The Trades Union Congress also urged firms to be flexible, if possible, and allow workers to start later on Monday. TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""Bosses should talk to their staff about flexible working arrangements ahead of Monday morning - perhaps allowing them to start later and claim back their time afterwards."" Some stores are changing their hours to accommodate the big event. The Co-op is closing its stores at 7.45pm on Sunday, rather than its normal closing time of between 10-11pm, in order to give staff the chance to watch the match. Tesco will also close its Express stores in England at 7:45pm on Sunday evening. Supermarket chain Lidl will alter its opening hours on Monday if England wins to allow staff an additional hour to ""kick back and relax in the morning"". Shoppers and staff alike were likely to appreciate the extra time first thing, the supermarket said. The petition calls for a bank holiday this coming Monday, but arranging a bank holiday at such short notice would not be possible. The government also said it did not want to pre-empt the outcome of Sunday's match. ""Clearly we want England to go all the way and win the final, and then we will set out our plans in due course,"" it added. Parliament considers all petitions that get more than 100,000 signatures for a debate. There are eight bank holidays a year in England and Wales, nine in Scotland, and ten in Northern Ireland. Bank holidays are created under the Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971, or are created by royal proclamation - that is, by the Queen, who acts on government advice. The department responsible for bank holidays is the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Bank holidays are not actually statutory holidays, although most workers do get the day off. Nine things you might not know about bank holidays The petition, which was started by marketing manager Lee Jones, says: ""English people would naturally want to continue to enjoy the win, giving the retail and leisure industry a much-needed opportunity to make up lost revenues."" Will England's success boost the UK economy? 'Euro 2020 is a lifeline for my pub' How can I watch the Euros final with my friends? A win for England over Italy on Sunday night would be the first major triumph for the country since 1966 saw it win the World Cup. The match is set to end at 10pm, but if it goes to extra time it could finish closer to 11pm, the semi-final against Denmark on Wednesday was not over until 10.45pm. Boss of Stagefreight Ian Uttley is trying to be flexible with his drivers Some firms are already working on the assumption there will be some sort of hangover effect on their workforce and are trying to work around it. Ian Uttley director at transport firm Stagefreight, told the BBC's Wake Up to Money Programme he had been doing his best to give drivers a later start: ""We do have a lot of England fans but it's  very difficult. We try to give them later shifts but at the end of the day they are professional drivers doing a professional job. ""We are trying to give them time off. It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience but we do work seven days a week and there'll always be someone in a truck somewhere who will need to drive the next day. Someone has to get the food to the supermarket shelves and into the shops."" He said there were strict checks in place to ensure no-one was tempted to over celebrate: ""We expect them to limit alcohol limits and we expect them to be under the limit when they start driving - and we do conduct checks."" Downing Street supports the idea, saying employers who are able to should be flexible about allowing staff to go in to work late on Monday or take the day off if England win. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's official spokesman said: ""We would want businesses who feel able to consider it if they can, but we recognise it will vary depending on the business and company."" MrJohnson has already said pubs can stay open until 11.15pmthis Sunday to reduce the risk of customers being told to leave before the match ends. Downing Street has said it will set out any celebrations such as a victory parade for the England team ""in due course"", but has not confirmed whether plans for a potential bank holiday are in motion behind the scenes.

UK Brexit minister says EU negotiations 'a little tense',"Lord Frost is appearing in person before the committee The UK's Brexit minister has described negotiations with the EU overthe Northern Ireland Protocolas ""a little tense"" at the moment. Lord Frost appeared in person at Stormont's Executive Office committee on Friday. He said the UK and EU needed to find a ""new balance"" to ensure problems with the protocol's implementation were resolved. But he said elements of the protocol were also currently ""working well"". Lord Frost's evidence to the committee came just a week after the EU's chief negotiator gave evidence to the committee. Appearing before the committee, Lord Frost repeated thatthe government is preparing to publish its plans for the future of the protocol in the next fortnight, before Parliament rises for the summer recess. He said the EU had still not responded to 12 papers tabled by the UK. As it happened: Lord Frost briefs MLAs The EU has said a temporary Swiss-style veterinary agreement for Northern Ireland, in which the UK continues to follow EU agri-food rules, could be a solution, but it has been rejected by the UK. Lord Frost accused the EU of being unreasonable in responding to some of the UK's concerns. ""Their solution is 'why don't you adopt our rules, then there won't be a problem'. We're accused of being ideological but it seems to me, equally ideological to say 'why don't you just adopt our laws?'"" He said there were possible resolutions but that ""getting politics in the right place seems to be difficult"". Lord Frost's appearance at the committee comes just over a week after EU chief negotiator Maros Sefcovic addressed a Stormont committee ""It is a little tense at the moment. Nobody wants that but the protocol issues are at the core. ""There is a big prize if we can get this right, it does need both sides to take the situation seriously and fix the problems that currently exist,"" he added. The protocol is the part of the Brexit deal which keeps Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods and means EU customs rules are enforced at its ports. It was agreed by the UK and EU in October 2019 and was subject to further negotiation and agreement in 2020. Lord Frost helped to negotiate the protocol on behalf of the UK government, but previously said it was not being implemented as he intended. Under the terms of the Brexit withdrawal treaty, the protocol can only be removed by a majority vote of the Stormont Assembly, with a vote due in 2024. EU 'confident' about chilled meat ban solution EU postpones ban on British meat sales in NI GB-NI grace period extension 'problematic' - Irish PM Committee chairman, the SDLP's Colin McGrath, said the government needed to ""own your deal"" and work to develop pragmatic solutions. Sinn FÃ©in's Pat Sheehan put it to Lord Frost that political problems with the protocol were being ""completely overblown"" and that a majority of businesses in Northern Ireland were supportive of the protocol. The minister replied that GB-NI trade opportunities had changed and in some cases, disappeared, and that was not what the government had ""wanted to achieve"" when delivering Brexit. ""Nobody that I've spoken to from a wide range of political and civil society, businesses, nobody thinks it's working perfectly as it should, or have suggested improvements,"" he added. Earlier on Friday, Lord Frost had met business representatives from Newry Chamber of Commerce and Trade, and other business leaders. Lord Frost (centre) meets business leaders in Newry on Friday Former DUP Economy Minister Diane Dodds said the government needed to recognise that the protocol had no support from any unionist parties at Stormont. ""You and the EU have overridden consent and now want majority rule. What are you going to do to restore the balance of consent?,"" she asked. Lord Frost said he had ""a good deal of sympathy"" for that argument. ""The consent mechanism is an albeit imperfect way of allowing the institutions here to say, looking at all these variances it's working tolerably, or looking at them all, it's not working,"" he added. ""If you don't have a fairly broad consent at most points, this is not simply something about in four years' time - you need to have broad consent to make it workable and that's why it worries us so much that we don't have it. Ulster Unionist vice-chair of the committee, John Stewart asked Lord Frost to explain what any ""rebalancing"" of the protocol would look like. Lord Frost said he would not reveal the details prior to a statement being made in Parliament, but added that the ""fundamental issue"" was finding a way to ensure goods could move from GB to NI in a ""freer way than possible"" at present. Lord Frost's appearance at the committee comes just over a week after EU chief negotiator Maros Sefcovicgave evidence to MLAs about the post-Brexit Northern Ireland Protocol. Last week, the EU agreed to a UK request to delay a ban on chilled meat products from Great Britain being sold in Northern Ireland. Products such as chilled sausages were due to be prohibited from 1 July as a consequence of the protocol arrangement,but this has been postponed for another three months.

Keep using NHS Covid app people urged,"This video can not be played Grant Shapps: 'As our restrictions change, the NHS app needs to change in line' People should continue using the NHS Covid contact tracing app in England and Wales and isolate when asked to do so, Downing Street has said. The prime minister's spokesman said the app had been an ""important tool"" and Boris Johnson continued to use it. The software detects the distance between users and the length of time spent in close proximity - currently 2m or less and more than 15 minutes. It comes amid a huge rise in alerts asinfections surge. The latest government figures show UK infections are continuing to rise, with 35,707 Covid cases reported on Friday - the highest daily cases figure since 22 January. A further 29 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded. Earlier Transport Secretary Grant Shapps saidthe app's sensitivity may need to changewhen the 1m-plus rule ends on 19 July. The system allows people who test positive to anonymously share their test result, triggering alerts for those detected as close contacts in the days before the test. What happens if I'm 'pinged' by the app? How many people are deleting the Covid app? Marked increase in Covid infections across UK Under current rules, those who receive an alert are asked to stay at home for up to 10 days, although the Department of Health said the app ""is, and always has been, advisory"" - unlike the requirement to isolate if you are contacted directly by NHS Test and Trace. Coronavirus restrictions are set to end on 19 July butthe requirement to self-isolate if you have had both vaccine doses will only stop on 16 August, raising fears thatmillions of people would be asked to self-isolate this summeras people mixed more. The hospitality industry and NHS trusts have warned MPs the knock-on effect for the economy and workplaces could be huge. The prime minister's spokesman said: ""A large number of the population continues to use the app and it has been an important tool in getting people to isolate and break the chain of transmission. ""It is important that people continue to isolate if they are asked to do so. We continue to ask people to isolate if they are asked to through the app."" The Welsh government has saidpeople in Wales should continue to use the app even if social distancing rules differ from those in England. No date has been given for the end of the 1m-plus rule in Wales. One possible solution could be to change the sensitivity of the app, so it would tell people to self-isolate only after closer and more prolonged contact. But sources at the app developers told the BBC they have not yet been asked to do this, although they are planning a change from 16 August when people would be able to record that they were fully vaccinated to turn off the self-isolation countdown timer. Mr Shapps told BBC Breakfast: ""As our restrictions change, of course the app needs to change. Things like replacing the 1m-plus rule on 19 July might well lead to a review of the way the app itself needs to function."" The most recent figures for the last week of June show an extra 300,000 downloads, bringing the total to more than 26 million, but it is not known how many people are active users. ""It's in our interests as a society to carry on doing the things that protect each other,"" Mr Shapps said. Technically, it wouldn't be very difficult to tweak the app to make it less ""sensitive"" - the hard bit is working out exactly what those tweaks should be. Currently, two phones with the app installed, exchange a digital handshake, via bluetooth, every five minutes. It registers how far apart they are, and for how long. If one of those phones then goes on to report a positive Covid test, other phones who were two metres away or less, for a duration of 15 minutes during a 24 hour period, are likely to receive an isolation alert. As we have learned more about the virus, other factors have also been incorporated such as how infectious the person was likely to have been at the time the two phones were in close proximity. Changing those parameters would be straightforward. But fundamentally it's the volume of cases which are driving the volume of isolation alerts, not the app itself. In the last week of June there were 356,000 alerts, triggered by 61,000 positive test reports - that's about six app users isolating per Covid case. When you look at it like that, it doesn't sound so excessive. And because of the app's focus on privacy nobody, including the government, the police and the NHS knows who has been ""pinged"" - making it legally unenforceable. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he was concerned about the possible changes, saying weakening the app would undermine the track and trace system the government had spent billions on. He said: ""This feels like taking the batteries out of the smoke detector and that is never a good idea."" Dr Jenny Harries, the head of the new UK Health Security Agency, told MPs on Thursday she was ""aware that people are choosing not to use the app"" when asked about concerns people have been deleting it to avoid being ""pinged"". Hinting at a change, she added there was ""work ongoing at the moment because it is entirely possible to tune the app to ensure that it is appropriate to the risk"". What are the holiday rules for Portugal, Malta and Spain? I'm fully jabbed, so do I have to self-isolate? How the England and Wales contact-tracing app works A source close to Health Secretary Sajid Javid told the BBC ""we are looking at the sensitivity of the app"" and pointed out the sensitivity had been changed before - although they did not say what would change. At present, if two phones running the app are close for long enough, and one of the two users later shares a positive coronavirus test via the app, then the other will receive an alert. Users can also use the app to ""check-in"" to venues enabling it to notify them of any positive cases they may have encountered there -although the requirement to check-in will be lifted in England when lockdown rules ease further on 19 July. A total of 496 venue alerts - which use the check-in data to alert people to potential contact with a positive case - were sent between 24 June and 30 June. But alerts for people coming into close contact with someone testing positive soared by more than 60% in the last week of June to 360,000. At the end of May, there were only 16,000 alerts in a week. A BBC analysis has estimated 4.5 million peoplecould be asked to self-isolatebetween this week and 16 August, as the number of infections continues to rise. The NHS Covid-19 app is used in England and Wales. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own powers to set coronavirus regulations andseparate test-and-trace programmes. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? COVID IMMUNITY:Can you catch it twice? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries Prof Sir Jonathan Montgomery, a healthcare law expert from University College London who advised the government on the initial launch of the app, said it could still be useful but the government needed to issue new guidance. ""The real reason we shouldn't abandon the tool is because so many transmissions of Covid happen before people realise they are unwell,"" he told Times Radio.

We will be back with more updates tomorrow morning. Here's a final round-up of the main headlines:  Today's coverage was brought to you by Hamish Mackay, Mary O'Connor, Jo Couzens, Jen Meierhans. The live page was edited by Hugo Bachega. The government confirmed large events like festivals could run after restrictions ease on 19 July Last year, the coronavirus pandemic wiped out theUK's summer festival season.Only a handful of shows were able to take place, and most of them were in car parks or socially-distanced green field sites. But the Reading Festival has now come one step closer to going ahead this summerafter the local council granted its event licence. It comes after the government confirmed Covid restrictions would end on 19 July, meaning large events like festivals could run. Reading Borough Council said there would need to be ""detailed consideration"" on how to minimise the risk of coronavirus. The festival - which was cancelled last year due to the pandemic - is expected to take place from 27 to 29 August this year. The line-up for this year's event is set to include Stormzy, Catfish & The Bottlemen, Post Malone, Disclosure, Liam Gallagher and Queens of the Stone Age. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Heart inflammation has been found to be a ""very rare"" side-effect of the coronavirus vaccinesmade by Pfizer and Moderna, according to the European Medicines Agency. Europe's watchdog said the side-effects were more common in younger men. It added that the benefits of Covid-19 vaccines continue to far outweigh any risks but advised doctors and patients to be aware of the symptoms of heart inflammation. These include chest pain, a feeling of breathlessness and a pounding or fluttering heartbeat. Anyone with these symptoms should see a doctor. Two conditions were linked to the vaccines - inflammation of the heart muscle itself, known as myocarditis, and inflammation of the fluid-filled sac the heart sits in, known as pericarditis. Five people died. The review said they were all either elderly or had other health conditions. The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has also been investigating the link. Myocarditis and pericarditis will be officially listed as side-effects in the UK and Europe, mirroring a move by the regulators in the US last month. Peter MwaiBBC Reality Check The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that a third wave of Covid-19 cases in Africa could get worse as new and faster spreading variants like Delta drive infections. New weekly cases have now overtaken the weekly numbersrecorded at the height of the second wave in January this year and less than 2% of the continent has been fully vaccinated. ""The worst is yet to come as the fast-moving third wave continues to gain speed and new ground,"" says Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa. More than 251,000 new cases were recorded in the week ending 4 July, making it the ""worst pandemic week ever"", he says. The WHO believes the spread of the Delta variant - which is more transmissible - has contributed to an increase in both cases and deaths across the continent. Covid vaccines are highly effective in people with underlying health conditionswho were advised to shield earlier in the pandemic, real-world UK data reveals. The study,externalof more than a million people in at-risk groups shows two doses of the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines are needed for this protection. Being double-jabbed reduced the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 by around 90%. One dose cut it by about 60%, says Public Health England (PHE). Protection against hospitalisation and death in at-risk groups is expected to be greater than protection against symptomatic disease, as has been seen in studies of the general population, although more data is needed to confirm this. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at PHE, said: ""This real-world data shows for the first time that most people who are clinically vulnerable to Covid-19 still receive high levels of protection after two doses of vaccine."" Michael Andrew said he did not want to risk taking time off training because of any side effects US swimmer Michael Andrew, a gold medal favourite at the Olympics, said
he has not been vaccinated and has no plans to do so before the Tokyo Games, which begin on 23 July. Andrew, 22, told reporters he did not
want to risk taking time off training because of any vaccine side effects. ""I didn't want to put anything in my body that I didn't
know how I would potentially react to,"" he said. Andrew is the most prominent US athlete so far to
reveal vaccine hesitancy. There is no provision demanding Olympic athletes to
be vaccinated, even amid concerns about the pandemic-era games. Instead, the
11,500 athletes competing this year will be subject to routine Covid-19 testing
and strict social distancing guidelines while there. Of the more than 80 million Covid vaccinations given in the UK as of Thursday, 45,697,875 were first doses - a rise of 96,430 on the previous day. Meanwhile, 34,374,246 were second doses, an increase of 175,467. Jerome Wirawan and Liza TambunanBBC Indonesia Health workers in Indonesia are set to receive a third dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine, in a government bid to boost their immunity against new variants of the virus. Moderna doses will arrive in the country on Sunday, with plans to begin vaccinations as soon as next week, Health Minister Budi Sadikin said. Between January and 9 July, 210 doctors died with Covid, according to the Indonesian Doctors Association. Twenty of them had been vaccinated using Sinovac, raising concerns over the efficacy of the Chinese-developed vaccine. Indonesia is currently experiencing a surge of cases linked to the highly infectious Delta variant. The government has put in place emergency restrictions on the islands of Java and Bali to drive down the infection rate, which has continued to break records in recent days. On Thursday, the country recorded more than 38,000 new cases, bringing the official tally to more than 2.4 million cases. More than 63.700 deaths have been recorded so far. The UK recorded another 35,707 new Covid-19 infections on Friday, the highest number of daily cases since 22 January. The government's coronavirus dashboard,externalalso recorded a further 29 deaths within 28 days of a positive test bringing the total so far to 128,365. A 16-year old receives a dose of the Pfizer vaccine The US state of Tennessee has halted vaccine outreach efforts to adolescents and teenagers after pressure
from conservative lawmakers, according toThe Tennessean,external. The state's top health official told colleagues last
week they should no longer advertise vaccine sites to anyone beyond the ""general population"" and should halt pop-up events for adolescents, the
newspaper said. The move comes two weeks after Republican state
lawmakers criticised health officials for recommending the Covid-19 jabs to
minors. In May, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was authorised in the US for
adolescents as young as 12. US vaccination rates have slowed in recent weeks, in
part due to lower turnout in southern states. Less than half of
Tennesseeâs residents aged 18 and older have been fully vaccinated - trailing
behind states like Vermont where more than 76% have been fully vaccinated. About 67% of American adults have received at least one shot. Malta is to ban all visitors from Wednesday unless they are fully vaccinated against Covid-19, the health minister has announced. ""We will be the first EU country to do so, but we need to
protect our society,"" Chris Fearne told a news conference, as the country reports a surge in cases. Malta is among a handful of countries on the UK's travel green list, meaning travellers returning from these countries to England do not need to quarantine. All UK passengers have had to present proof of full vaccination since 30 June, according toForeign Office travel advice,external. The restrictions have had a huge impact on the travel industry A group of top holiday firms including Ryanair, BA, tour operator Tui and Manchester Airports Group have launchedlegal action against the UK government over its Covid travel restrictions. They want more transparency over how the government takes decisions on its travel rules, including how it assesses the Covid threat in destination countries. The legal action is going ahead despite an easing of travel rules that will allow, from 19 July,fully vaccinated UK residents to return to England from an amber-list country without having to quarantine. Their case, which is against Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, was heard at London's High Court on Friday. Thetraffic light systemrates countries green, amber or red based on their Covid risk. Red-list countries have the strictest rules, with only UK or Irish nationals, or UK residents, allowed to return - and they must pay for a 10-day stay in a government quarantine hotel. There are still just a handful of ""green"" destinations, which tend to be smaller islands, for example, Malta. Major holiday destinations, such as Spain, Greece, France and the US, remain amber. The Department for Transport spokesperson said its traffic light system was intended to manage the risk of new variants, and added that the department could not comment on legal proceedings. It will be invitation only at the Copa America final at Rio's MaracanÃ£ stadium Yes, there's another final happening. Brazil and Argentina will decide the Copa America at Rio's MaracanÃ£ stadium on Saturday, and it will be invitation only. The city's mayor said only 6,500 spectators - 10% of the famous stadium's capacity - invited by the South American football federation, Conmebol, will allowed in. Everyone attending the event in the Brazilian city will be required to present a negative Covid-19 test before entering. For tomorrow's final, attendees will be spread throughout the entire stadium, instead of concentrated in one section, the mayor's office confirmed. The Brazilian government has drawn widespread criticism among public health experts and the public for hosting the Copa America, even as the country has yet to get the coronavirus pandemic under control. Some 140 people associated with the tournament had tested positive for the virus by late June, said Reuters. Hywel GriffithBBC Wales correspondent The Welsh government has announced that the use of face coverings will no longer be required in classrooms in Wales from September, and entire contact groups or so-called bubbles will no longer have to self-isolate as the result of a positive test in the next academic year. Schools, colleges and universities will take a track-and-trace approach instead, following the announcement last month that institutions would be allowed to choose their own rules - though teaching unions said this would be confusing. Education Minister Jeremy Miles has written to headteachers and principals to issue new guidance, saying that many young people had told him the current system was not proportionate. The new guidance, which comes into force on 1 September, says social distancing should be maintained where possible in secondary schools, including staff keeping two metres from each other. We have more on the guidance here. The lights at Le Duplex nightclub - next to the Champs Elysees avenue in Paris - are switched on as clubs prepare to reopen In France,nightclubs will be allowed to reopen on Fridayfor the first time in nearly 18 months as coronavirus restrictions meant they had to remain shut. Venues' capacity will be capped at 75% of normal, masks are recommended but not mandatory and clubbers will need to show proof of vaccination or a recent negative Covid test to gain entry, the AFP news agency reports. But not all clubs will be opening their doors as the Delta Covid variant continues to spread. It's believed only around a quarter of clubs will actually reopen - and only then with reduced capacity. The trade body that represents the industry says around 400 nightclubs have been forced to close permanently or are in deep financial trouble. Health Minister Olivier Veran was quoted by AFP as saying: ""We'll remain very vigilant, and obviously if we have to reverse course because things are going badly, we'll do what we have to."" He added that Delta infections now account for nearly 50% of the total new cases, and ""will soon account for the majority, probably this weekend."" Stendhal music festival will be held for the first time since 2019 The first music festival to be held in Northern Ireland since the start of the pandemic is under way. Stendhal Festival - based in Limavady, County Londonderry - iswelcoming back fewer numbersthan previous years. The festival, established in 2011, attracted a 10,000-strong crowd in 2019 - but this year about 2,500 visitors are expected. It follows Stormont's announcement thatlive music in Northern Ireland could resume from 5 July, as part of further relaxations to Covid-19 rules. While music performed indoors is restricted to an ""ambient sound level"" with screens placed in front of musicians, no volume restrictions apply to live music at outdoor events. Celia HattonBBC Asia Pacific regional editor North Korea has reportedly rejected donations of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine due to concerns over potential side effects, according to a South Korean think tank. The country has yet to confirm a single case of Covid-19, a claim long-questioned by analysts. Last week, its leader, Kim Jong-un,punished several officials after referring to an unspecified Covid-related incident, according to a North Korean state media report. But still, North Korea appears to be in no rush to procure vaccines. The Institute for National Security Strategy (INSS) in Seoul, which is linked to South Korea's spy agency, said Pyongyang had rejected donations of AstraZeneca on fears of its potential side effects. The Covax global vaccine distribution scheme allocated almost two million AstraZeneca shots to North Korea in February, but the shipments were delayed following extended consultations. The INSS said the country also refused Chinese vaccines in the belief they are not effective. The North Korean leadership reportedly favours Russian vaccines.

Olympic teams have been travelling to Tokyo ahead of the Games With the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics fast approaching, the Japanese authorities have decided to declare a state of emergency in Tokyo. The Olympics begin on 23 July while the Paralympics start on 24 August, but events in the capital will take placewithout any spectators. So, what is the situation with infections in Japan, and how many people have been vaccinated? Our Reality Check team has answered those questions and others. The coronavirus reproduction number, or R value, in England has increased slightly to between 1.2 and 1.5, according to the latest government figures. This is up from last week, when it was 1.1 to 1.3. The R value represents the average number of people each person with Covid-19 goes on to infect. When the figure is above 1, an outbreak can grow exponentially. When it's below 1, it means the epidemic is shrinking. An R number between 1.2 and 1.5 means, on average, every 10 people infected will infect between 12 and 15 other people. The growth rate is 3% to 7%, which means the number of new infections is growing by 3% to 7% every day. Â© 2025 BBC.

The government confirmed large events like festivals could run after restrictions ease on 19 July Last year, the coronavirus pandemic wiped out theUK's summer festival season.Only a handful of shows were able to take place, and most of them were in car parks or socially-distanced green field sites. But the Reading Festival has now come one step closer to going ahead this summerafter the local council granted its event licence. It comes after the government confirmed Covid restrictions would end on 19 July, meaning large events like festivals could run. Reading Borough Council said there would need to be ""detailed consideration"" on how to minimise the risk of coronavirus. The festival - which was cancelled last year due to the pandemic - is expected to take place from 27 to 29 August this year. The line-up for this year's event is set to include Stormzy, Catfish & The Bottlemen, Post Malone, Disclosure, Liam Gallagher and Queens of the Stone Age. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Heart inflammation has been found to be a ""very rare"" side-effect of the coronavirus vaccinesmade by Pfizer and Moderna, according to the European Medicines Agency. Europe's watchdog said the side-effects were more common in younger men. It added that the benefits of Covid-19 vaccines continue to far outweigh any risks but advised doctors and patients to be aware of the symptoms of heart inflammation. These include chest pain, a feeling of breathlessness and a pounding or fluttering heartbeat. Anyone with these symptoms should see a doctor. Two conditions were linked to the vaccines - inflammation of the heart muscle itself, known as myocarditis, and inflammation of the fluid-filled sac the heart sits in, known as pericarditis. Five people died. The review said they were all either elderly or had other health conditions. The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has also been investigating the link. Myocarditis and pericarditis will be officially listed as side-effects in the UK and Europe, mirroring a move by the regulators in the US last month. Peter MwaiBBC Reality Check The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that a third wave of Covid-19 cases in Africa could get worse as new and faster spreading variants like Delta drive infections. New weekly cases have now overtaken the weekly numbersrecorded at the height of the second wave in January this year and less than 2% of the continent has been fully vaccinated. ""The worst is yet to come as the fast-moving third wave continues to gain speed and new ground,"" says Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa. More than 251,000 new cases were recorded in the week ending 4 July, making it the ""worst pandemic week ever"", he says. The WHO believes the spread of the Delta variant - which is more transmissible - has contributed to an increase in both cases and deaths across the continent. Covid vaccines are highly effective in people with underlying health conditionswho were advised to shield earlier in the pandemic, real-world UK data reveals. The study,externalof more than a million people in at-risk groups shows two doses of the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines are needed for this protection. Being double-jabbed reduced the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 by around 90%. One dose cut it by about 60%, says Public Health England (PHE). Protection against hospitalisation and death in at-risk groups is expected to be greater than protection against symptomatic disease, as has been seen in studies of the general population, although more data is needed to confirm this. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at PHE, said: ""This real-world data shows for the first time that most people who are clinically vulnerable to Covid-19 still receive high levels of protection after two doses of vaccine."" Michael Andrew said he did not want to risk taking time off training because of any side effects US swimmer Michael Andrew, a gold medal favourite at the Olympics, said
he has not been vaccinated and has no plans to do so before the Tokyo Games, which begin on 23 July. Andrew, 22, told reporters he did not
want to risk taking time off training because of any vaccine side effects. ""I didn't want to put anything in my body that I didn't
know how I would potentially react to,"" he said. Andrew is the most prominent US athlete so far to
reveal vaccine hesitancy. There is no provision demanding Olympic athletes to
be vaccinated, even amid concerns about the pandemic-era games. Instead, the
11,500 athletes competing this year will be subject to routine Covid-19 testing
and strict social distancing guidelines while there. Of the more than 80 million Covid vaccinations given in the UK as of Thursday, 45,697,875 were first doses - a rise of 96,430 on the previous day. Meanwhile, 34,374,246 were second doses, an increase of 175,467. Jerome Wirawan and Liza TambunanBBC Indonesia Health workers in Indonesia are set to receive a third dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine, in a government bid to boost their immunity against new variants of the virus. Moderna doses will arrive in the country on Sunday, with plans to begin vaccinations as soon as next week, Health Minister Budi Sadikin said. Between January and 9 July, 210 doctors died with Covid, according to the Indonesian Doctors Association. Twenty of them had been vaccinated using Sinovac, raising concerns over the efficacy of the Chinese-developed vaccine. Indonesia is currently experiencing a surge of cases linked to the highly infectious Delta variant. The government has put in place emergency restrictions on the islands of Java and Bali to drive down the infection rate, which has continued to break records in recent days. On Thursday, the country recorded more than 38,000 new cases, bringing the official tally to more than 2.4 million cases. More than 63.700 deaths have been recorded so far. The UK recorded another 35,707 new Covid-19 infections on Friday, the highest number of daily cases since 22 January. The government's coronavirus dashboard,externalalso recorded a further 29 deaths within 28 days of a positive test bringing the total so far to 128,365. A 16-year old receives a dose of the Pfizer vaccine The US state of Tennessee has halted vaccine outreach efforts to adolescents and teenagers after pressure
from conservative lawmakers, according toThe Tennessean,external. The state's top health official told colleagues last
week they should no longer advertise vaccine sites to anyone beyond the ""general population"" and should halt pop-up events for adolescents, the
newspaper said. The move comes two weeks after Republican state
lawmakers criticised health officials for recommending the Covid-19 jabs to
minors. In May, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was authorised in the US for
adolescents as young as 12. US vaccination rates have slowed in recent weeks, in
part due to lower turnout in southern states. Less than half of
Tennesseeâs residents aged 18 and older have been fully vaccinated - trailing
behind states like Vermont where more than 76% have been fully vaccinated. About 67% of American adults have received at least one shot. Malta is to ban all visitors from Wednesday unless they are fully vaccinated against Covid-19, the health minister has announced. ""We will be the first EU country to do so, but we need to
protect our society,"" Chris Fearne told a news conference, as the country reports a surge in cases. Malta is among a handful of countries on the UK's travel green list, meaning travellers returning from these countries to England do not need to quarantine. All UK passengers have had to present proof of full vaccination since 30 June, according toForeign Office travel advice,external. The restrictions have had a huge impact on the travel industry A group of top holiday firms including Ryanair, BA, tour operator Tui and Manchester Airports Group have launchedlegal action against the UK government over its Covid travel restrictions. They want more transparency over how the government takes decisions on its travel rules, including how it assesses the Covid threat in destination countries. The legal action is going ahead despite an easing of travel rules that will allow, from 19 July,fully vaccinated UK residents to return to England from an amber-list country without having to quarantine. Their case, which is against Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, was heard at London's High Court on Friday. Thetraffic light systemrates countries green, amber or red based on their Covid risk. Red-list countries have the strictest rules, with only UK or Irish nationals, or UK residents, allowed to return - and they must pay for a 10-day stay in a government quarantine hotel. There are still just a handful of ""green"" destinations, which tend to be smaller islands, for example, Malta. Major holiday destinations, such as Spain, Greece, France and the US, remain amber. The Department for Transport spokesperson said its traffic light system was intended to manage the risk of new variants, and added that the department could not comment on legal proceedings. It will be invitation only at the Copa America final at Rio's MaracanÃ£ stadium Yes, there's another final happening. Brazil and Argentina will decide the Copa America at Rio's MaracanÃ£ stadium on Saturday, and it will be invitation only. The city's mayor said only 6,500 spectators - 10% of the famous stadium's capacity - invited by the South American football federation, Conmebol, will allowed in. Everyone attending the event in the Brazilian city will be required to present a negative Covid-19 test before entering. For tomorrow's final, attendees will be spread throughout the entire stadium, instead of concentrated in one section, the mayor's office confirmed. The Brazilian government has drawn widespread criticism among public health experts and the public for hosting the Copa America, even as the country has yet to get the coronavirus pandemic under control. Some 140 people associated with the tournament had tested positive for the virus by late June, said Reuters. Hywel GriffithBBC Wales correspondent The Welsh government has announced that the use of face coverings will no longer be required in classrooms in Wales from September, and entire contact groups or so-called bubbles will no longer have to self-isolate as the result of a positive test in the next academic year. Schools, colleges and universities will take a track-and-trace approach instead, following the announcement last month that institutions would be allowed to choose their own rules - though teaching unions said this would be confusing. Education Minister Jeremy Miles has written to headteachers and principals to issue new guidance, saying that many young people had told him the current system was not proportionate. The new guidance, which comes into force on 1 September, says social distancing should be maintained where possible in secondary schools, including staff keeping two metres from each other. We have more on the guidance here. The lights at Le Duplex nightclub - next to the Champs Elysees avenue in Paris - are switched on as clubs prepare to reopen In France,nightclubs will be allowed to reopen on Fridayfor the first time in nearly 18 months as coronavirus restrictions meant they had to remain shut. Venues' capacity will be capped at 75% of normal, masks are recommended but not mandatory and clubbers will need to show proof of vaccination or a recent negative Covid test to gain entry, the AFP news agency reports. But not all clubs will be opening their doors as the Delta Covid variant continues to spread. It's believed only around a quarter of clubs will actually reopen - and only then with reduced capacity.

Couzens accused of indecent exposure in 2015,"Wayne Couzens will be sentenced for the murder of Sarah Everard in September PC Wayne Couzens was accused of indecent exposure six years before he murdered Sarah Everard, it has emerged. Kent Police is now being investigated by the Independent Office for Police Conduct (IOPC) over whether it handled the allegations in 2015 properly. The IOPC is also examining allegations the Met Police did not investigate adequately another claim that Couzens had exposed himself. That alleged incident happened in south London only days before the killing. Firearms officer Couzens haspleaded guilty to the 33-year-old marketing executive's murder. He will be sentenced in September. Two officers are under investigation for possible breaches of professional standards in relation to the alleged flashing offence in London,said to have happened in a fast-food restaurant. Sarah Everard: Daughter, sister, friend and colleague In total, the IOPC said 12 gross misconduct or misconduct notices had so far been served on police officers from several forces relating to the Couzens case. One IOPC investigation is examining allegations that a probationary Met constable, who was at a cordon around a scene of investigation in the case, shared an ""inappropriate graphic"" with colleagues via social media. Three officers have been served with gross misconduct notices in relation to that allegation. Sarah Everard was abducted in south London by Couzens, who drove her to Kent where he raped and strangled her The IOPC is also looking into allegations that officers from several different police forces breached standards of professional behaviour by sharing via a messaging app information that was linked to the prosecution of Couzens. One officer has been served with a gross misconduct notice and another six have received misconduct notices. Additionally, the IOPC is examining the circumstances around Couzens sustaining head injuries in custody, on 10 and 12 March, while he was being held on suspicion of Ms Everard's murder. It said all officers in that inquiry were being treated as witnesses. This video can not be played Commissioner Cressida Dick: ""All of us in the Met are sickened, angered and devastated"" Couzens joined theCivil Nuclear Constabulary,external(CNC) in March 2011, leaving to work for the Met in September 2018. He was initially based in Bromley in south-east London then moved to the Parliamentary and Diplomatic Protection Command, where his primary role was uniformed patrols, mainly at a range of embassies in the central London. The CNC said Couzens served for eight months at Sellafield in Cumbria before transferring to Dungeness, Kent, where he was based for the rest of his service. Before joining the CNC, he was with Kent Police. The CNC said Couzens underwent an ""enhanced level of vetting"" and had no records of complaints or misconduct made against him.

"Sarah Everard: Daughter, sister, friend and colleague","The murder of Sarah Everard sparked a national outcry, spurring women to share their experiences of feeling unsafe on the streets. Many included a sense of the teller lining themselves up shoulder-to-shoulder with her: ""She was the same age as me"", ""I used to live near her"", ""I've walked the same route"". Ms Everard didn't set herself up to be such an everywoman, a symbol of longstanding - and ongoing - violence against women. She had no choice in her name becoming a battle cry for change. The private, excoriating grief of friends and family seems to have been subsumed by the wider - albeit important and valid - reactions of protest and polemic, marches and mass mourning. Sarah Everard was a daughter, sister, friend and colleague. According to those in the know, she was dreadful at karaoke but ""brilliant"" at everything else. There were just 38 minutes between the time this ""clever, articulate and caring"" woman left a friend's house and the last time she was seen. The final image of her, captured by a bus camera, also showed a white Vauxhall Astra with its hazard lights on and both front doors open. The car had been hired specifically for kidnapping a woman. It was returned to the rental company the following morning, having served its purpose. Sarah Everard was dead. Her body was found a week later in a woodland stream in Ashford, Kent, where her killer owned a patch of land. A complete stranger, a police officer, had kidnapped, raped and murdered her. He knew what he was doing, this man who killed her for his own gratuitous wants. Outwardly, he had what appeared to be a perfectly ordinary life. A responsible job. Wife and children. A house in Deal in Kent he shared with them. But the 48-year-old officer's faÃ§ade hid the actions of a sexual predator who had been planning the crime - although not yet selecting his victim - in chilling detail. On 28 February, three days before he killed Ms Everard, he had been accused of indecent exposure in a branch of McDonald's. It wasn't the first time. The very same day, he bought a roll of self-adhesive plastic described as ""carpet protector"" and booked the hire car he would use to abduct the marketing executive. He arranged for time off work. After he killed Ms Everard, he bought builders' bags, a tarpaulin and a cargo net, wiped his phone and concocted an implausible and time-wasting web of lies about his involvement in her disappearance. That they won't have to sit through the grisly evidence and twisted lies of a trial must be scant relief to her loved ones. Ms Everard should have had a brilliant future, a lot to look forward to. She had bounced back after a relationship breakup and was seeing someone new. She had just started a new job. She, her boyfriend Josh Lowth and four others were planning a trip to Ibiza at the end of summer. One of Ms Everard's friends said: ""What I loved about her was that she had depth. She wasn't a vapid, nice person. She had opinions, sarcasm and wanted things to be better. ""We could trust her to fight the good fight."" Ms Everard grew up in York, with an older brother and sister. Her father was a professor and her mother a charity worker. Described by her family as ""bright and beautiful"", ""kind and thoughtful"", ""caring and dependable"", she ""always put others first and had the most amazing sense of humour. She was strong and principled and a shining example to us all"". Rose Woollard has been a close friend of Ms Everard since university, and was one of the first to become alarmed. She contacted the BBC in an attempt to raise awareness before Ms Everard's disappearance had become an official police investigation. Met PC pleads guilty to Sarah Everard murder Couzens was accused of indecent exposure in 2015 Ms Woollard said: ""Sarah has always been an exceptional friend, dropping everything to be there to support her friends, whenever they need her. ""It was only recently that she was telling me the good news about her new role, which she was excited to start."" ""She was sunshine and light, and made you feel warm and good and safe,"" said another friend. ""I feel angry about it as well, but my main anger is that it happened to her."" A former colleague said: ""Sometimes you meet a person with a beautiful soul and it shines through. ""There is nothing anyone can say that will make things better for her family and loved ones. They must be in hell. I can only say that Sarah was a very special person and will be missed by so many."" The uproar over Ms Everard's death, and what she has come to represent, led one friend to say: ""I would like to just say who she was to me, as a person. ""Finding the right words is so hard. ""I can't sum her up in a few well-chosen words, nor express what she meant to me by sharing memories. I can only skim the surface now in the wake of the horror and the anger, and work through the rest alone in the weeks and months to follow. ""Sarah was open. Honest. Unflinching in her ability to listen and empathise. There are some people you know for a relatively short time, but whom you instantly strike up a close bond with due to your similarities - Sarah was one of these people. We shared a lot, and I was never in any doubt of her discretion or sincerity in her support and kindness. We laughed, we cried. We talked about the future. ""She should be here."" A simple post on Facebook on 14 June said: ""Happy Birthday Sarah Everard. I miss you today, and every single day"". When she was taken, Ms Everard was less than a mile from her flat in Brixton. The killer had been cruising around for more than four hours before he saw her for the first time. Years of predatory behaviour, days of planning, hours of scouting, and mere minutes to trap his prey. This was a decision he made. It was not a frenzied attack in which a person loses self-control.

Quarantine rules to be eased for some NI travellers,"The Stormont executive agreed 26 July as an indicative date for easing quarantine rules From 26 July, fully vaccinated people returning to Northern Ireland from so-called amber countries will not have to quarantine under new indicative dates agreed by the executive for lifting Covid restrictions. Stormont ministers agreed the changes when they met on Thursday. They also agreed that theatres are to be allowed to reopen on 26 July. The requirement for face coverings to be worn in places of worship could also be removed then. However, most proposals will need to be ratified at an executive meeting on 22 July. What can I do as NI's Covid restrictions ease? The plans agreed at Thursday's executive meeting mean that Northern Ireland will not directly follow the approach Prime Minister Boris Johnson has outlined for England. He has said masks will no longer be required and social distancing rules will be scrapped for England at the final stage of his government's plan, due to take effect on 19 July. The plan to end the mandatory wearing of masks in England on 19 July will not be replicated in Northern Ireland Stormont ministers have agreed to make the following changes on 26 July, subject to health advice: the reopening of theatres and indoor seated venues for performances - with mitigations including entry only by tickets bought ahead of an event the return of conferences and exhibitions live music indoors with no restrictions on sound levels 10 people from three households to meet indoors in a private home 15 people from any number of households to meet in a private garden remove the ""linked households/bubble"" provision close contact services to operate without appointments reduce the legal requirement for social distancing to 1m indoors and remove it for all outdoor activities - instead keeping social distancing guidance to advise 1m if possible for all activities indoors and outdoors remove some restrictions in MoT centres to make it easier for examiners to carry out vehicle tests It is understood ministers also agreed to consider removing the guidelines for students to wear face coverings in classrooms and school ""bubbles"" but that, along with other measures, would be subject to public health conditions on 22 July. It is understood the executive has agreed to give consideration to the full return of live music and dancing without mitigations later in August. The BBC understands ministers will at that stage, also look at lifting remaining restrictions on mandatory use of face coverings, as well as the removal of social distancing and isolating. The government's Transport Secretary Grant Shapps hasset out his plans for England. From 19 July, fully vaccinated adults there will not need to isolate from amber list countries.

It is believed all of the measures would still need to be rubber stamped closer to the time at an executive meeting on 22 July. Theatres and some other audience venues have been closed or had to restrict numbers throughout the  pandemic because of social-distancing guidance. Johnson's Covid-easing plan reckless, says O'Neill NI public urged to keep wearing masks They had previously been given an indicative date of 21 June for their reopening but the executive has so far delayed that. Jimmy Fay of the Lyric Theatre in Belfast said on Thursday that the vaccination programme had been ""such a success that we need to look at a date, preferably in September, when we can remove all social distancing in theatres"". Some other indoor entertainment venues such as cinemas have been allowed to resume trading. Speaking after the executive meeting, First Minister Paul Givan said ministers from his party - the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) - believed more progress could be made ""at a faster pace"". ""We believe that is backed up by all of the data, the scientific evidence, the impact on our economy and the impact on family and wider society,"" said Mr Givan. The minister said the executive had received a ""very positive report"" about a falling number of Covid-19-related deaths, but that other ministers decided they wanted to ""move forward at a slower pace"". Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the executive had taken a ""cautious"" and ""steady"" approach, which she believed was the ""right one"". She said ""the Boris Johnson approach"" to easing restrictions was reckless. ""Based on our own information and our own data we have taken decisions today that demonstrates progress, demonstrates that we're able to continue to make some easements,"" said Ms O'Neill. Earlier Sir Michael McBride, Northern Ireland's chief medical officer, has expressed concern about mixed messages on issues such as masks. This video can not be played Concern over public messaging 'inconsistencies' around face masks ""It's important that we guard against sending the public mixed messages about the evidence around matters such as face coverings and the benefit of face coverings,"" he said. ""Whether those are mandatory or whether those are voluntary, those are policy matters and ultimately a matter for ministers."" Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon met representatives from the Unite union ahead of the executive meeting. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

everything and hopefully get another goal and see where it takes us."" England v Italy (Sun, 20:00 BST) As a player, captain, fan and pundit I've had so many big moments with England, but Sunday's European Championship final at Wembley will be the biggest of them all. I'm 50 and we've not been to a major men's final before in my lifetime. There are generations who are the same, who have never seen us get here before. Waiting so long makes it feel even more special now we have made it - to be honest it is still sinking in.

Mark, Marlow England v Italy (Sun, 20:00 BST) Speaking of the veteran Italian defenders... Leonardo Bonuccihas been speaking today, and it seems he was in a joyful mood. He joked about his and defensive partner Giorgio Chiellini's age as they prepare to face England in Sunday's Euro 2020 final. Bonucci, 34, and Chiellini, 36, know they'll have to be wary of the pace of Raheem Sterling and Bukayo Saka at Wembley. ""It is youngsters against old men,"" Bonucci told a news conference on Friday. ""They have very strong attackers, we will need great attention towards them and the whole team. ""We know the difficulties they can give us and we will have to be careful about their speed."" The Juventus pair are still renowned as two of the best defenders in the world, but Bonucci has lauded both Harry Maguire and John Stones. ""England have a super defence, I already said this during the qualifying phase,"" he added. ""They have an excellent midfield, and behind them are (Harry) Maguire and (John) Stones who had great seasons at Manchester United and City. ""We will need to give great attention as a defence and show a lot of cunning to score in attack."" England v Italy (Sun, 20:00 BST) With fans having returned to Wembley during the tournament, England defender John Stones says the players have ""thrived"" off their presence at Wembley. ""We have definitely thrived off the fans,"" he said. ""We cannot thank them for their support through the good times and the bad times. They turn up home and away and their support is key to us as players. We'll be playing for them again on Sunday."" On Italy's centre-back pairing of Giorgio Chiellini and Leonardo Bonucci:""I admire what they have done in their careers and how they go about their game as professionals. ""This will be my first time up against them and it will be a special occasion to play against so many good players, who have won a lot of things in their careers. To still be playing at the level they are is definitely something I admire."" England v Italy (Sun, 20:00 BST) Speaking about facing Italy in the final, the defender says both teams ""deserve to be there."" ""There's two teams in this final and we both deserve to be there,"" said Stones. ""Italy are defensively solid and a side that have lots of attacking flair. ""That's what you want as a footballer, as a professional, to come up against these sort of teams and prove to yourself that you can outshine them, or come out of yourself or be yourself in these sort of big occasions and we definitely thrive off that. ""I definitely do and I'm really excited for Sunday."" England v Italy (Sun 20:00 BST) John Stones says England's first major men's final since 1966 will be ""even more special"" with it being held on home soil at Wembley. ""It's huge and with it being at Wembley as well, it's even more special,"" he said. ""I think it's something we only could have dreamt of at the start of the tournament. We're here to try and win it and we've got this far now and I think we've just grown and grown throughout the tournament.

England's 1966 winnerSir Geoff Hurstis confident about the Three Lions' chances on Sunday - though he does not think anyone will repeat his hat-trick heroics from 55 years ago. ""What are our chances? Good. We have got a
very good team, we've been doing very well, well managed, and right from the
start I've felt we had a good bunch of players, a lot of very good young
players. ""I always felt we had a chance and that hasn't changed.
I always felt right from the beginning the team that beat Italy would win it
because they are very strong as well. ""I think the best two teams are in the final. (Playing)
against a great country in Italy, and a great footballing nation, it should be
a great final. ""I predict it is going to be a very tight game between
two fantastic teams. I can't see a a 4-2 scoreline like we saw in 66. That
would be a big shock really. ""You can't see either team conceding that amount of
goals. It will be very hard - as it's proved for the last 55 years - for a
player to score three. But I've had a great record and someone's got to do it
(one day). ""But it's not about an individual scoring three. It is
just about, as it has been right the way through, a great team winning."" Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
UK military not defeated in Afghanistan - generalGeneral Sir Nick Carter responds to a mother questioning what her soldier son died for in Afghanistan.UK,"The UK may be withdrawing most of its troops from Afghanistan but it was not defeated on the battlefield, the head of the British armed forces has said. It comes after the mother of the youngest British soldier to die there questioned what had been achieved. Chief of Defence Staff General Sir Nick Carter said attacks such as 9/11 had been prevented from ""occurring from Afghanistan"" in the period since. He added ""not a day goes by"" without him thinking of the 457 UK lives lost. Confirming most of Britain's troops had now left Afghanistan,Prime Minister Boris Johnson saidthere could ""never be a perfect moment"" to withdraw but the UK's presence there was ""never intended to be permanent"". Lucy Aldridge, mother of William Aldridge, who was 18 when he was killed in 2009, told the BBC: ""I'd like to see with my own eyes, what did we achieve? What was the sacrifice for? Because it's too high a price to pay."" Asked for his response to Ms Aldridge, Gen Carter told the Today programme he ""absolutely"" understood ""where the bereaved come from"". This video can not be played ""We have to live with our losses for the rest of our lives"" - mother Lucy Aldridge reflects on the loss of her son William ""All those who fought in Afghanistan can hold their heads up very high,"" he said. ""The British military was not defeated on the battlefield. They showed remarkable adaptability against a very cunning and nefarious opponent, and they showed phenomenal courage under great pressure. ""And, at the end of the day, we have prevented attacks like the one we saw from al-Qaeda on 9/11 ever occurring from Afghanistan in this intervening period, and I think there's no reason to suppose that that can't prevail."" At the height of the war, Nato had more than 130,000 troops from 50 nations in Afghanistan. The UK had 9,500 personnel and 137 bases in Helmand province alone. But with both the US and UK withdrawing their troops from Afghanistan, violence has been rising and the Taliban are thought to now control more than a third of the country's 400 districts. On Friday, Afghan officials said the Talibanhad captured a major border crossing between Afghanistan and Iran. Gen Carter said the Afghan army had made a strategic decision to withdraw from some rural parts of the country and concentrate forces on key urban areas. 20 years in Afghanistan: Was it worth it? Echoes of 1989 as foreign forces leave Afghanistan Biden defends US withdrawal amid Taliban advance Asked if he thought the almost two decades spent there had been a success or a failure, Gen Carter said it was ""too early to judge"" - and he saw three possible scenarios that could play out. ""I think, first and foremost, the current Afghan government, with its very well-trained army, could hold the ring, as it's demonstrating through holding all of the provincial capitals at the moment,"" he said. ""The second scenario - a very sad scenario - is where the country fractures and you see that government collapse, the Taliban perhaps controlling part of the country and the other nationalities and ethnicities controlling other parts of the country, like we saw in the 1990s. ""Then I think there is a third, more hopeful scenario, which is where you actually see a political compromise and talks occurring. ""If the current Afghan government holds on for long enough and proves to the Taliban it can't be defeated, then I think the third scenario becomes ever more likely."" Asked if the US and UK were abandoning their responsibilities by leaving, the general said both nations would maintain a ""diplomatic presence in Kabul for the foreseeable future"". He added the current Afghan army was the best the country had ever had, and that Afghan government institutions, including the army, would continue to receive support in the form of international funding. From 9/11, to intense fighting on the ground, and now full withdrawal of US-led forces, hereâs what happened. 11 September 2001 Al-Qaeda, led by Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan, carries out the largest terror attack ever conducted on US soil. Four commercial airliners are hijacked. Two are flown into the World Trade Centre in New York, which collapses. One hits the Pentagon building in Washington, and one crashes into a field in Pennsylvania. Nearly 3,000 people are killed. 7 October 2001 A US-led coalition bombs Taliban and al-Qaeda facilities in Afghanistan. Targets include Kabul, Kandahar and Jalalabad. The Taliban, who took power after a decade-long Soviet occupation was followed by civil war, refuse to hand over Bin Laden. Their air defences and small fleet of fighter aircraft are destroyed. 13 November 2001 The Northern Alliance, a group of anti-Taliban rebels backed by coalition forces, enters Kabul as the Taliban flee the city. By the 13 November 2001, all Taliban have either fled or been neutralised. Other cities quickly fall. 26 January 2004 After protracted negotiations at a “loya jirga” or grand assembly, the new Afghan constitution is signed into law. The constitution paves the way for presidential elections in October 2004. 7 December 2004 Hamid Karzai, the leader of the Popalzai Durrani tribe, becomes the first president under the new constitution. He serves two five-year terms as president. May 2006 British troops arrive in Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold in the south of the country. Their initial mission is to support reconstruction projects, but they are quickly drawn into combat operations. More than 450 British troops lose their lives in Afghanistan over the course of the conflict. 17 February 2009 US President Barack Obama approves a major increase in the number of troops sent to Afghanistan. At their peak, they number about 140,000. The so-called “surge” is modelled on US strategy in Iraq where US forces focussed on protecting the civilian population as well as killing insurgent fighters. 2 May 2011 The leader of al-Qaeda is killed in an assault by US Navy Seals on a compound in Abbottabad in Pakistan. Bin Ladenâs body is removed and buried at sea. The operation ends a 10-year hunt led by the CIA. Â The confirmation that Bin Laden had been living on Pakistani soil fuels accusations in the US that Pakistan is an unreliable ally in the war on terror. 23 April 2013 The founder of the Taliban, Mullah Mohammed Omar, dies. His death is kept secret for more than two years. According to Afghan intelligence, Mullah Omar dies of health problems at a hospital in the Pakistani city of Karachi. Pakistan denies that he was in the country. 28 December 2014 At a ceremony in Kabul, Nato ends its combat operations in Afghanistan. With the surge now over, the US withdraws thousands of troops. Â Most of those who remain focus on training and supporting the Afghan security forces. 2015 The Taliban launch a series of suicide attacks, car bombings and other assaults. The parliament building in Kabul, and the city of Kunduz are attacked. Islamic State militants begin operations in Afghanistan. 25 January 2019 Afghan President Ashraf Ghani says more than 45,000 members of his countryâs security forces have been killed since he became leader in 2014. The figure is far higher than previously thought. 29 February 2020 The US and the Taliban sign an “agreement for bringing peace” to Afghanistan, in Doha, Qatar. The US and Nato allies agree to withdraw all troops within 14 months if the militants uphold the deal. 13 April 2021 US president Joe Biden announces that all US troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September 2021. 16 August 2021 In just over a month, the Taliban sweep across Afghanistan, taking control of towns and cities all over the country, including Kabul. Afghan security forces collapse in the face of the Taliban advance.

"Covid jabs very effective for shielders, data saysA study of more than a million people shows those with other conditions get high protection from two doses.","Covid vaccines are highly effective in people with underlying health conditions who were advised to shield earlier in the pandemic, real-world UK data reveals. The study,externalof more than a million people in at-risk groups shows two doses of the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines are needed for this protection. Being double-jabbed reduced the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 by around 90%. One dose cut it by about 60%, says Public Health England (PHE). Covid-19: People share feelings on end of shielding Shielding teenager goes back to school after 450 days It takes a couple of weeks for the protection offered by a second to kick in. Protection against hospitalisation and death in at-risk groups is expected to be greater than protection against symptomatic disease, as has been seen in studies of the general population, although more data is needed to confirm this. The preprint study findings also cover a time period when the Alpha, or UK, coronavirus variant was dominant, rather than the Delta one, which is behind most infections occurring now. But experts are increasingly confident that existing vaccines still work well against Delta. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at PHE, said: ""This real-world data shows for the first time that most people who are clinically vulnerable to Covid-19 still receive high levels of protection after two doses of vaccine. ""It is vital that anyone with an underlying condition gets both doses, especially people with weakened immune systems as they gain so much more benefit from the second dose."" In the study, one dose of vaccine was, on average, only 4% effective in people with weakened immune systems. Efficacy increased to 74%, however, after two doses. The charityBlood Cancer UK,externalsays much more data is needed to assess vaccine efficacy in different groups of people who are immunocompromised. Chief Executive Gemma Peters said: ""The study states that vaccine response is lower in the immunocompromised, and there are too few immunocompromised people to draw confident conclusions.

Dua Lipa sued for sharing paparazzi photoThe pop star faces legal action after allegedly posting a paparazzi photo of herself on Instagram.,"The star has deleted the Instagram post in which she was alleged to have shared a copyrighted image Dua Lipa is being sued after allegedly putting a paparazzi photo of herself on Instagram. According to US court documents, the star was snapped queuing at an airport in February 2019 and later shared the shot with her fans ""without permission or authorisation"". Integral Images says Lipa profited from the photo, as her Instagram feed acts as a marketing tool for her music. It is seeking $150,000 (Â£108,000) damages and has asked for a jury trial. The company is also asking for an order preventing the singer from further acts of infringement, as well as legal costs. Lipa posted the photo to her Instagram account on 7 February 2019, about four days after it was taken. The now-deleted post shows the star standing in line, clutching her airline ticket and passport, while wearing an oversize hat, ""I'll be living under big fluffy hats until further notice,"" she wrote in the caption. Why some paparazzi are suing celebrities Integral Images had applied to register copyright for the images, and the request was granted on 20 February 2021 - after Lipa's Instagram post - according to records from the US Copyright Office. The company claims Lipa ""knowingly"" posted the photo to social media without permission, and stood to make money from the shot. Court documents obtained by the BBC claim her Instagram account is ""monetised in that it contains content designed to accumulate followers who are directed to, via link and/or advertisement, consume and purchase [her] content"". Lipa's team has been contacted for a response. The singer performed a medley of her hits at this year's Brits, going on to win two awards Although many people assume they can post an image in which they are the subject, copyright law means the photographer usually owns the rights. Lipa is not the first star to be sued for sharing paparazzi images of themselves to social media. Gigi Hadid, Liam Hemsworth and Khloe Kardashian have all faced similar cases, while in 2019 both Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber settled complaints brought by photographer Robert Barbera. In the same year, Jennifer Lopez was sued by the Splashy News and Picture Agency for posting a photo of herself and Alex Rodriguez to Instagram. The company later voluntarily dismissed the complaint with prejudice. Outside of the legal case Lipa is having a stellar year,winning best album at the Britsand best pop album at the Grammys for her lockdown antidote Future Nostalgia. She has also landed her first film role, starring alongside Henry Cavill, Sam Rockwell, Bryce Dallas Howard and Samuel L Jackson in the upcoming spy thriller Argylle. Lipa will also provide original music for the film's title track and score. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

Calls grow for extra bank holiday if England win,"Prime minister Boris Johnson is coming under pressure to give workers a one-off bank holiday if England win their final Euro 2020 championship on Sunday. Apetition on the Parliament website,externalpassed 320,000 signatures on Friday. It says an extra day off would help families to watch the match together. Mr Johnson said granting a bank holiday now would be ""tempting fate"". The Trades Union Congress also urged firms to be flexible, if possible, and allow workers to start later on Monday. TUC General Secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""Bosses should talk to their staff about flexible working arrangements ahead of Monday morning - perhaps allowing them to start later and claim back their time afterwards."" Some stores are changing their hours to accommodate the big event. The Co-op is closing its stores at 7.45pm on Sunday, rather than its normal closing time of between 10-11pm, in order to give staff the chance to watch the match. Tesco will also close its Express stores in England at 7:45pm on Sunday evening. Supermarket chain Lidl will alter its opening hours on Monday if England wins to allow staff an additional hour to ""kick back and relax in the morning"". Shoppers and staff alike were likely to appreciate the extra time first thing, the supermarket said. The petition calls for a bank holiday this coming Monday, but arranging a bank holiday at such short notice would not be possible. The government also said it did not want to pre-empt the outcome of Sunday's match. ""Clearly we want England to go all the way and win the final, and then we will set out our plans in due course,"" it added. Parliament considers all petitions that get more than 100,000 signatures for a debate. There are eight bank holidays a year in England and Wales, nine in Scotland, and ten in Northern Ireland. Bank holidays are created under the Banking and Financial Dealings Act 1971, or are created by royal proclamation - that is, by the Queen, who acts on government advice. The department responsible for bank holidays is the Department of Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. Bank holidays are not actually statutory holidays, although most workers do get the day off. Nine things you might not know about bank holidays The petition, which was started by marketing manager Lee Jones, says: ""English people would naturally want to continue to enjoy the win, giving the retail and leisure industry a much-needed opportunity to make up lost revenues."" Will England's success boost the UK economy? 'Euro 2020 is a lifeline for my pub' How can I watch the Euros final with my friends? A win for England over Italy on Sunday night would be the first major triumph for the country since 1966 saw it win the World Cup. The match is set to end at 10pm, but if it goes to extra time it could finish closer to 11pm, the semi-final against Denmark on Wednesday was not over until 10.45pm. Boss of Stagefreight Ian Uttley is trying to be flexible with his drivers Some firms are already working on the assumption there will be some sort of hangover effect on their workforce and are trying to work around it. Ian Uttley director at transport firm Stagefreight, told the BBC's Wake Up to Money Programme he had been doing his best to give drivers a later start: ""We do have a lot of England fans but it's  very difficult. We try to give them later shifts but at the end of the day they are professional drivers doing a professional job. ""We are trying to give them time off. It's a once-in-a-lifetime experience but we do work seven days a week and there'll always be someone in a truck somewhere who will need to drive the next day. Someone has to get the food to the supermarket shelves and into the shops."" He said there were strict checks in place to ensure no-one was tempted to over celebrate: ""We expect them to limit alcohol limits and we expect them to be under the limit when they start driving - and we do conduct checks."" Downing Street supports the idea, saying employers who are able to should be flexible about allowing staff to go in to work late on Monday or take the day off if England win. Prime Minister Boris Johnson's official spokesman said: ""We would want businesses who feel able to consider it if they can, but we recognise it will vary depending on the business and company."" MrJohnson has already said pubs can stay open until 11.15pmthis Sunday to reduce the risk of customers being told to leave before the match ends. Downing Street has said it will set out any celebrations such as a victory parade for the England team ""in due course"", but has not confirmed whether plans for a potential bank holiday are in motion behind the scenes.

People urged to keep using NHS Covid app,"This video can not be played Grant Shapps: 'As our restrictions change, the NHS app needs to change in line' People should continue using the NHS Covid contact tracing app in England and Wales and isolate when asked to do so, Downing Street has said. The prime minister's spokesman said the app had been an ""important tool"" and Boris Johnson continued to use it. The software detects the distance between users and the length of time spent in close proximity - currently 2m or less and more than 15 minutes. It comes amid a huge rise in alerts asinfections surge. The latest government figures show UK infections are continuing to rise, with 35,707 Covid cases reported on Friday - the highest daily cases figure since 22 January. A further 29 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded. Earlier Transport Secretary Grant Shapps saidthe app's sensitivity may need to changewhen the 1m-plus rule ends on 19 July. The system allows people who test positive to anonymously share their test result, triggering alerts for those detected as close contacts in the days before the test. What happens if I'm 'pinged' by the app? How many people are deleting the Covid app? Marked increase in Covid infections across UK Under current rules, those who receive an alert are asked to stay at home for up to 10 days, although the Department of Health said the app ""is, and always has been, advisory"" - unlike the requirement to isolate if you are contacted directly by NHS Test and Trace. Coronavirus restrictions are set to end on 19 July butthe requirement to self-isolate if you have had both vaccine doses will only stop on 16 August, raising fears thatmillions of people would be asked to self-isolate this summeras people mixed more. The hospitality industry and NHS trusts have warned MPs the knock-on effect for the economy and workplaces could be huge. The prime minister's spokesman said: ""A large number of the population continues to use the app and it has been an important tool in getting people to isolate and break the chain of transmission. ""It is important that people continue to isolate if they are asked to do so. We continue to ask people to isolate if they are asked to through the app."" The Welsh government has saidpeople in Wales should continue to use the app even if social distancing rules differ from those in England. No date has been given for the end of the 1m-plus rule in Wales. One possible solution could be to change the sensitivity of the app, so it would tell people to self-isolate only after closer and more prolonged contact. But sources at the app developers told the BBC they have not yet been asked to do this, although they are planning a change from 16 August when people would be able to record that they were fully vaccinated to turn off the self-isolation countdown timer. Mr Shapps told BBC Breakfast: ""As our restrictions change, of course the app needs to change. Things like replacing the 1m-plus rule on 19 July might well lead to a review of the way the app itself needs to function."" The most recent figures for the last week of June show an extra 300,000 downloads, bringing the total to more than 26 million, but it is not known how many people are active users. ""It's in our interests as a society to carry on doing the things that protect each other,"" Mr Shapps said. Technically, it wouldn't be very difficult to tweak the app to make it less ""sensitive"" - the hard bit is working out exactly what those tweaks should be. Currently, two phones with the app installed, exchange a digital handshake, via bluetooth, every five minutes. It registers how far apart they are, and for how long. If one of those phones then goes on to report a positive Covid test, other phones who were two metres away or less, for a duration of 15 minutes during a 24 hour period, are likely to receive an isolation alert. As we have learned more about the virus, other factors have also been incorporated such as how infectious the person was likely to have been at the time the two phones were in close proximity. Changing those parameters would be straightforward. But fundamentally it's the volume of cases which are driving the volume of isolation alerts, not the app itself. In the last week of June there were 356,000 alerts, triggered by 61,000 positive test reports - that's about six app users isolating per Covid case. When you look at it like that, it doesn't sound so excessive. And because of the app's focus on privacy nobody, including the government, the police and the NHS knows who has been ""pinged"" - making it legally unenforceable. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he was concerned about the possible changes, saying weakening the app would undermine the track and trace system the government had spent billions on. He said: ""This feels like taking the batteries out of the smoke detector and that is never a good idea."" Dr Jenny Harries, the head of the new UK Health Security Agency, told MPs on Thursday she was ""aware that people are choosing not to use the app"" when asked about concerns people have been deleting it to avoid being ""pinged"". Hinting at a change, she added there was ""work ongoing at the moment because it is entirely possible to tune the app to ensure that it is appropriate to the risk"". What are the holiday rules for Portugal, Malta and Spain? I'm fully jabbed, so do I have to self-isolate? How the England and Wales contact-tracing app works A source close to Health Secretary Sajid Javid told the BBC ""we are looking at the sensitivity of the app"" and pointed out the sensitivity had been changed before - although they did not say what would change. At present, if two phones running the app are close for long enough, and one of the two users later shares a positive coronavirus test via the app, then the other will receive an alert. Users can also use the app to ""check-in"" to venues enabling it to notify them of any positive cases they may have encountered there -although the requirement to check-in will be lifted in England when lockdown rules ease further on 19 July. A total of 496 venue alerts - which use the check-in data to alert people to potential contact with a positive case - were sent between 24 June and 30 June. But alerts for people coming into close contact with someone testing positive soared by more than 60% in the last week of June to 360,000. At the end of May, there were only 16,000 alerts in a week. A BBC analysis has estimated 4.5 million peoplecould be asked to self-isolatebetween this week and 16 August, as the number of infections continues to rise. The NHS Covid-19 app is used in England and Wales. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own powers to set coronavirus regulations andseparate test-and-trace programmes. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? COVID IMMUNITY:Can you catch it twice? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries Prof Sir Jonathan Montgomery, a healthcare law expert from University College London who advised the government on the initial launch of the app, said it could still be useful but the government needed to issue new guidance. ""The real reason we shouldn't abandon the tool is because so many transmissions of Covid happen before people realise they are unwell,"" he told Times Radio.

UK military not defeated in Afghanistan - generalGeneral Sir Nick Carter responds to a mother questioning what her soldier son died for in Afghanistan.,"The UK may be withdrawing most of its troops from Afghanistan but it was not defeated on the battlefield, the head of the British armed forces has said. It comes after the mother of the youngest British soldier to die there questioned what had been achieved. Chief of Defence Staff General Sir Nick Carter said attacks such as 9/11 had been prevented from ""occurring from Afghanistan"" in the period since. He added ""not a day goes by"" without him thinking of the 457 UK lives lost. Confirming most of Britain's troops had now left Afghanistan,Prime Minister Boris Johnson saidthere could ""never be a perfect moment"" to withdraw but the UK's presence there was ""never intended to be permanent"". Lucy Aldridge, mother of William Aldridge, who was 18 when he was killed in 2009, told the BBC: ""I'd like to see with my own eyes, what did we achieve? What was the sacrifice for? Because it's too high a price to pay."" Asked for his response to Ms Aldridge, Gen Carter told the Today programme he ""absolutely"" understood ""where the bereaved come from"". This video can not be played ""We have to live with our losses for the rest of our lives"" - mother Lucy Aldridge reflects on the loss of her son William ""All those who fought in Afghanistan can hold their heads up very high,"" he said. ""The British military was not defeated on the battlefield. They showed remarkable adaptability against a very cunning and nefarious opponent, and they showed phenomenal courage under great pressure. ""And, at the end of the day, we have prevented attacks like the one we saw from al-Qaeda on 9/11 ever occurring from Afghanistan in this intervening period, and I think there's no reason to suppose that that can't prevail."" At the height of the war, Nato had more than 130,000 troops from 50 nations in Afghanistan. The UK had 9,500 personnel and 137 bases in Helmand province alone. But with both the US and UK withdrawing their troops from Afghanistan, violence has been rising and the Taliban are thought to now control more than a third of the country's 400 districts. On Friday, Afghan officials said the Talibanhad captured a major border crossing between Afghanistan and Iran. Gen Carter said the Afghan army had made a strategic decision to withdraw from some rural parts of the country and concentrate forces on key urban areas. 20 years in Afghanistan: Was it worth it? Echoes of 1989 as foreign forces leave Afghanistan Biden defends US withdrawal amid Taliban advance Asked if he thought the almost two decades spent there had been a success or a failure, Gen Carter said it was ""too early to judge"" - and he saw three possible scenarios that could play out. ""I think, first and foremost, the current Afghan government, with its very well-trained army, could hold the ring, as it's demonstrating through holding all of the provincial capitals at the moment,"" he said. ""The second scenario - a very sad scenario - is where the country fractures and you see that government collapse, the Taliban perhaps controlling part of the country and the other nationalities and ethnicities controlling other parts of the country, like we saw in the 1990s. ""Then I think there is a third, more hopeful scenario, which is where you actually see a political compromise and talks occurring. ""If the current Afghan government holds on for long enough and proves to the Taliban it can't be defeated, then I think the third scenario becomes ever more likely."" Asked if the US and UK were abandoning their responsibilities by leaving, the general said both nations would maintain a ""diplomatic presence in Kabul for the foreseeable future"". He added the current Afghan army was the best the country had ever had, and that Afghan government institutions, including the army, would continue to receive support in the form of international funding. From 9/11, to intense fighting on the ground, and now full withdrawal of US-led forces, hereâs what happened. 11 September 2001 Al-Qaeda, led by Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan, carries out the largest terror attack ever conducted on US soil. Four commercial airliners are hijacked. Two are flown into the World Trade Centre in New York, which collapses. One hits the Pentagon building in Washington, and one crashes into a field in Pennsylvania. Nearly 3,000 people are killed. 7 October 2001 A US-led coalition bombs Taliban and al-Qaeda facilities in Afghanistan. Targets include Kabul, Kandahar and Jalalabad. The Taliban, who took power after a decade-long Soviet occupation was followed by civil war, refuse to hand over Bin Laden. Their air defences and small fleet of fighter aircraft are destroyed. 13 November 2001 The Northern Alliance, a group of anti-Taliban rebels backed by coalition forces, enters Kabul as the Taliban flee the city. By the 13 November 2001, all Taliban have either fled or been neutralised. Other cities quickly fall. 26 January 2004 After protracted negotiations at a “loya jirga” or grand assembly, the new Afghan constitution is signed into law. The constitution paves the way for presidential elections in October 2004. 7 December 2004 Hamid Karzai, the leader of the Popalzai Durrani tribe, becomes the first president under the new constitution. He serves two five-year terms as president. May 2006 British troops arrive in Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold in the south of the country. Their initial mission is to support reconstruction projects, but they are quickly drawn into combat operations. More than 450 British troops lose their lives in Afghanistan over the course of the conflict. 17 February 2009 US President Barack Obama approves a major increase in the number of troops sent to Afghanistan. At their peak, they number about 140,000. The so-called “surge” is modelled on US strategy in Iraq where US forces focussed on protecting the civilian population as well as killing insurgent fighters. 2 May 2011 The leader of al-Qaeda is killed in an assault by US Navy Seals on a compound in Abbottabad in Pakistan. Bin Ladenâs body is removed and buried at sea. The operation ends a 10-year hunt led by the CIA. Â The confirmation that Bin Laden had been living on Pakistani soil fuels accusations in the US that Pakistan is an unreliable ally in the war on terror. 23 April 2013 The founder of the Taliban, Mullah Mohammed Omar, dies. His death is kept secret for more than two years. According to Afghan intelligence, Mullah Omar dies of health problems at a hospital in the Pakistani city of Karachi. Pakistan denies that he was in the country. 28 December 2014 At a ceremony in Kabul, Nato ends its combat operations in Afghanistan. With the surge now over, the US withdraws thousands of troops. Â Most of those who remain focus on training and supporting the Afghan security forces. 2015 The Taliban launch a series of suicide attacks, car bombings and other assaults. The parliament building in Kabul, and the city of Kunduz are attacked. Islamic State militants begin operations in Afghanistan. 25 January 2019 Afghan President Ashraf Ghani says more than 45,000 members of his countryâs security forces have been killed since he became leader in 2014. The figure is far higher than previously thought. 29 February 2020 The US and the Taliban sign an “agreement for bringing peace” to Afghanistan, in Doha, Qatar. The US and Nato allies agree to withdraw all troops within 14 months if the militants uphold the deal. 13 April 2021 US president Joe Biden announces that all US troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September 2021. 16 August 2021 In just over a month, the Taliban sweep across Afghanistan, taking control of towns and cities all over the country, including Kabul. Afghan security forces collapse in the face of the Taliban advance.

Coronavirus restrictions are set to end on 19 July butthe requirement to self-isolate if you have had both vaccine doses will only stop on 16 August, raising fears thatmillions of people would be asked to self-isolate this summeras people mixed more. The hospitality industry and NHS trusts have warned MPs the knock-on effect for the economy and workplaces could be huge. What happens if I'm 'pinged' by the app? Amber list quarantine for fully vaccinated to end What are the travel rules if I've had both jabs? One possible solution could be to change the sensitivity of the app, so it would tell people to self-isolate only after closer and more prolonged contact. But sources at the app developers told the BBC they have not yet been asked to do this, although they are planning a change from 16 August when people would be able to record that they were fully vaccinated to turn off the self-isolation countdown timer. Mr Shapps told BBC Breakfast: ""As our restrictions change, of course the app needs to change. Things like replacing the 1m-plus rule on 19 July might well lead to a review of the way the app itself needs to function."" But he said the app was still ""very important as one of the tools in our armoury"". He said there were still large numbers of people downloading it and said he had not seen any data showing people were deleting it. The most recent figures for the last week of June show an extra 300,000 downloads, bringing the total to more than 26 million, but it is not known how many people are active users. ""It's in our interests as a society to carry on doing the things that protect each other,"" Mr Shapps said. Technically, it wouldn't be very difficult to tweak the app to make it less ""sensitive"" - the hard bit is working out exactly what those tweaks should be. Currently, two phones with the app installed, exchange a digital handshake, via bluetooth, every five minutes. It registers how far apart they are, and for how long. If one of those phones then goes on to report a positive Covid test, other phones who were two metres away or less, for a duration of 15 minutes during a 24 hour period, are likely to receive an isolation alert. As we have learned more about the virus, other factors have also been incorporated such as how infectious the person was likely to have been at the time the two phones were in close proximity. Changing those parameters would be straightforward. But fundamentally it's the volume of cases which are driving the volume of isolation alerts, not the app itself. In the last week of June there were 356,000 alerts, triggered by 61,000 positive test reports - that's about six app users isolating per Covid case. When you look at it like that, it doesn't sound so excessive. And because of the app's focus on privacy nobody, including the government, the police and the NHS knows who has been ""pinged"" - making it legally unenforceable. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he was concerned about the possible changes, saying weakening the app would undermine the track and trace system the government had spent billions on. He said: ""This feels like taking the batteries out of the smoke detector and that is never a good idea."" A Downing Street source stressed people were still being encouraged to self-isolate if they got an alert, adding the Department of Health's statement that the app was advisory was consistent with the government's message to ""act cautiously, especially as we know cases will rise"". Dr Jenny Harries, the head of the new UK Health Security Agency, told MPs on Thursday she was ""aware that people are choosing not to use the app"" when asked about concerns people have been deleting it to avoid being ""pinged"". Hinting at a change, she added there was ""work ongoing at the moment because it is entirely possible to tune the app to ensure that it is appropriate to the risk"". What are the holiday rules for Portugal, Malta and Spain? I'm fully jabbed, so do I have to self-isolate? How the England and Wales contact-tracing app works A source close to Health Secretary Sajid Javid told the BBC ""we are looking at the sensitivity of the app"" and pointed out the sensitivity had been changed before. But they did not say exactly what would change. At present, if two phones running the app are close for long enough, and one of the two users later shares a positive coronavirus test via the app, then the other will receive an alert. You can also use the app to ""check-in"" to venues so you can be notified of any positive cases you may have encountered there, although the requirement to check-in will be lifted in England when lockdown rules ease further on 19 July. A total of 496 venue alerts - which use the check-in data to alert people to potential contact with a positive case - were sent between 24 June and 30 June. But alerts for people coming into close contact with someone testing positive soared by more than 60% in the last week of June to 360,000. At the end of May, there were only 16,000 alerts in a week. A BBC analysis has estimated 4.5 million peoplecould be asked to self-isolatebetween this week and 16 August, as the number of infections continues to rise. The NHS Covid-19 app is used in England and Wales. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own powers to set coronavirus regulations andseparate test-and-trace programmes. On Thursday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak acknowledged there was ""frustration"" at how theNHS contact tracing appcould continue to order the double jabbed to isolate. Prof Sir Jonathan Montgomery, a healthcare law expert from University College London who advised the government on the initial launch of the app, said it could still be useful but the government needed to issue new guidance. ""The real reason we shouldn't abandon the tool is because so many transmissions of Covid happen before people realise they are unwell,"" he told Times Radio. ""What the app does is enable you to be careful, and what the government needs to say is 'what does care look like in the new world?'."" LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? COVID IMMUNITY:Can you catch it twice? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries Meanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the country was ""moving to a system of testing rather than self-isolation"".

""I know how difficult it has been for people and I'm sorry for the hassle that people experienced as a result of this - it is coming to an end.""

Keep using NHS Covid app urges Downing Street,"This video can not be played Grant Shapps: 'As our restrictions change, the NHS app needs to change in line' People should continue using the NHS Covid contact tracing app in England and Wales and isolate when asked to do so, Downing Street has said. The prime minister's spokesman said the app had been an ""important tool"" and Boris Johnson continued to use it. The software detects the distance between users and the length of time spent in close proximity - currently 2m or less and more than 15 minutes. It comes amid a huge rise in alerts asinfections surge. The latest government figures show UK infections are continuing to rise, with 35,707 Covid cases reported on Friday - the highest daily cases figure since 22 January. A further 29 deaths within 28 days of a positive test were also recorded. Earlier Transport Secretary Grant Shapps saidthe app's sensitivity may need to changewhen the 1m-plus rule ends on 19 July. The system allows people who test positive to anonymously share their test result, triggering alerts for those detected as close contacts in the days before the test. What happens if I'm 'pinged' by the app? How many people are deleting the Covid app?

""It is important that people continue to isolate if they are asked to do so. We continue to ask people to isolate if they are asked to through the app."" The Welsh government has saidpeople in Wales should continue to use the app even if social distancing rules differ from those in England.

England v Italy (Sun, 20:00 BST) As a player, captain, fan and pundit I've had so many big moments with England, but Sunday's European Championship final at Wembley will be the biggest of them all. I'm 50 and we've not been to a major men's final before in my lifetime. There are generations who are the same, who have never seen us get here before. Waiting so long makes it feel even more special now we have made it - to be honest it is still sinking in.

Mark, Marlow England v Italy (Sun, 20:00 BST) Speaking of the veteran Italian defenders... Leonardo Bonuccihas been speaking today, and it seems he was in a joyful mood. He joked about his and defensive partner Giorgio Chiellini's age as they prepare to face England in Sunday's Euro 2020 final. Bonucci, 34, and Chiellini, 36, know they'll have to be wary of the pace of Raheem Sterling and Bukayo Saka at Wembley. ""It is youngsters against old men,"" Bonucci told a news conference on Friday. ""They have very strong attackers, we will need great attention towards them and the whole team. ""We know the difficulties they can give us and we will have to be careful about their speed."" The Juventus pair are still renowned as two of the best defenders in the world, but Bonucci has lauded both Harry Maguire and John Stones. ""England have a super defence, I already said this during the qualifying phase,"" he added. ""They have an excellent midfield, and behind them are (Harry) Maguire and (John) Stones who had great seasons at Manchester United and City. ""We will need to give great attention as a defence and show a lot of cunning to score in attack."" England v Italy (Sun, 20:00 BST) With fans having returned to Wembley during the tournament, England defender John Stones says the players have ""thrived"" off their presence at Wembley. ""We have definitely thrived off the fans,"" he said. ""We cannot thank them for their support through the good times and the bad times. They turn up home and away and their support is key to us as players. We'll be playing for them again on Sunday."" On Italy's centre-back pairing of Giorgio Chiellini and Leonardo Bonucci:""I admire what they have done in their careers and how they go about their game as professionals.

To still be playing at the level they are is definitely something I admire."" England v Italy (Sun, 20:00 BST) Speaking about facing Italy in the final, the defender says both teams ""deserve to be there."" ""There's two teams in this final and we both deserve to be there,"" said Stones. ""Italy are defensively solid and a side that have lots of attacking flair. ""That's what you want as a footballer, as a professional, to come up against these sort of teams and prove to yourself that you can outshine them, or come out of yourself or be yourself in these sort of big occasions and we definitely thrive off that. ""I definitely do and I'm really excited for Sunday."" England v Italy (Sun 20:00 BST) John Stones says England's first major men's final since 1966 will be ""even more special"" with it being held on home soil at Wembley. ""It's huge and with it being at Wembley as well, it's even more special,"" he said. ""I think it's something we only could have dreamt of at the start of the tournament. We're here to try and win it and we've got this far now and I think we've just grown and grown throughout the tournament.

Fury tests positive for coronavirusThe 24 July trilogy bout between Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder is postponed following a Covid-19 case in the Briton's camp.,"Fury and Wilder drew in December 2018 before the Briton landed a win in February 2020 The trilogy fight between Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder in Las Vegas on 24 July has been postponed after the Briton tested positive for coronavirus. A source close to Fury told BBC Sport the WBC world heavyweight champion was deeply frustrated by the situation. Fury tested positive on Thursday and after discussions with medical experts the fight was called off - it is likely to be rescheduled for October. Wilder's manager Shelly Finkel said: ""Deontay is disappointed."" The WBC have confirmed the postponement, while an official announcement from the promoters Top Rank is expected later on Friday. Fury beat Wilder to become WBC champion in February 2020 - 14 months after the pair shared a thrilling draw in Los Angeles. Neither man has fought since Fury's victory in Las Vegas. After a third fight fell through several times because of complications around the Covid-19 pandemic, Fury sought to move on and face fellow Briton Anthony Joshua, who holds the other three significant titles at heavyweight. But an arbitration hearing ruled Wilder had contractual grounds for a third contest. Fury is unbeaten in his 31 fights, while Wilder has just one defeat in 44 outings. BBC boxing correspondent Mike Costello said the delay ""also jeopardises the chances of Fury taking on Anthony Joshua later this year in a unification showdown"". He added: ""Joshua's team have been negotiating with the Ukrainian Oleksandr Usyk about a possible contest in September.""

"UK Brexit minister says EU negotiations ""a little tense""","Lord Frost is appearing in person before the committee The UK's Brexit minister has described negotiations with the EU overthe Northern Ireland Protocolas ""a little tense"" at the moment. Lord Frost appeared in person at Stormont's Executive Office committee on Friday. He said the UK and EU needed to find a ""new balance"" to ensure problems with the protocol's implementation were resolved. But he said elements of the protocol were also currently ""working well"". Lord Frost's evidence to the committee came just a week after the EU's chief negotiator gave evidence to the committee. Appearing before the committee, Lord Frost repeated thatthe government is preparing to publish its plans for the future of the protocol in the next fortnight, before Parliament rises for the summer recess. He said the EU had still not responded to 12 papers tabled by the UK. As it happened: Lord Frost briefs MLAs The EU has said a temporary Swiss-style veterinary agreement for Northern Ireland, in which the UK continues to follow EU agri-food rules, could be a solution, but it has been rejected by the UK. Lord Frost accused the EU of being unreasonable in responding to some of the UK's concerns. ""Their solution is 'why don't you adopt our rules, then there won't be a problem'. We're accused of being ideological but it seems to me, equally ideological to say 'why don't you just adopt our laws?'"" He said there were possible resolutions but that ""getting politics in the right place seems to be difficult"". Lord Frost's appearance at the committee comes just over a week after EU chief negotiator Maros Sefcovic addressed a Stormont committee ""It is a little tense at the moment. Nobody wants that but the protocol issues are at the core. ""There is a big prize if we can get this right, it does need both sides to take the situation seriously and fix the problems that currently exist,"" he added. The protocol is the part of the Brexit deal which keeps Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods and means EU customs rules are enforced at its ports. It was agreed by the UK and EU in October 2019 and was subject to further negotiation and agreement in 2020. Lord Frost helped to negotiate the protocol on behalf of the UK government, but previously said it was not being implemented as he intended. Under the terms of the Brexit withdrawal treaty, the protocol can only be removed by a majority vote of the Stormont Assembly, with a vote due in 2024. EU 'confident' about chilled meat ban solution EU postpones ban on British meat sales in NI GB-NI grace period extension 'problematic' - Irish PM Committee chairman, the SDLP's Colin McGrath, said the government needed to ""own your deal"" and work to develop pragmatic solutions. Sinn FÃ©in's Pat Sheehan put it to Lord Frost that political problems with the protocol were being ""completely overblown"" and that a majority of businesses in Northern Ireland were supportive of the protocol. The minister replied that GB-NI trade opportunities had changed and in some cases, disappeared, and that was not what the government had ""wanted to achieve"" when delivering Brexit. ""Nobody that I've spoken to from a wide range of political and civil society, businesses, nobody thinks it's working perfectly as it should, or have suggested improvements,"" he added. Earlier on Friday, Lord Frost had met business representatives from Newry Chamber of Commerce and Trade, and other business leaders. Lord Frost (centre) meets business leaders in Newry on Friday Former DUP Economy Minister Diane Dodds said the government needed to recognise that the protocol had no support from any unionist parties at Stormont. ""You and the EU have overridden consent and now want majority rule. What are you going to do to restore the balance of consent?,"" she asked. Lord Frost said he had ""a good deal of sympathy"" for that argument. ""The consent mechanism is an albeit imperfect way of allowing the institutions here to say, looking at all these variances it's working tolerably, or looking at them all, it's not working,"" he added. ""If you don't have a fairly broad consent at most points, this is not simply something about in four years' time - you need to have broad consent to make it workable and that's why it worries us so much that we don't have it. Ulster Unionist vice-chair of the committee, John Stewart asked Lord Frost to explain what any ""rebalancing"" of the protocol would look like. Lord Frost said he would not reveal the details prior to a statement being made in Parliament, but added that the ""fundamental issue"" was finding a way to ensure goods could move from GB to NI in a ""freer way than possible"" at present. Lord Frost's appearance at the committee comes just over a week after EU chief negotiator Maros Sefcovicgave evidence to MLAs about the post-Brexit Northern Ireland Protocol. Last week, the EU agreed to a UK request to delay a ban on chilled meat products from Great Britain being sold in Northern Ireland. Products such as chilled sausages were due to be prohibited from 1 July as a consequence of the protocol arrangement,but this has been postponed for another three months.

UK military not defeated in Afghanistan - general,"The UK may be withdrawing most of its troops from Afghanistan but it was not defeated on the battlefield, the head of the British armed forces has said. It comes after the mother of the youngest British soldier to die there questioned what had been achieved. Chief of Defence Staff General Sir Nick Carter said attacks such as 9/11 had been prevented from ""occurring from Afghanistan"" in the period since. He added ""not a day goes by"" without him thinking of the 457 UK lives lost. Confirming most of Britain's troops had now left Afghanistan,Prime Minister Boris Johnson saidthere could ""never be a perfect moment"" to withdraw but the UK's presence there was ""never intended to be permanent"". Lucy Aldridge, mother of William Aldridge, who was 18 when he was killed in 2009, told the BBC: ""I'd like to see with my own eyes, what did we achieve? What was the sacrifice for? Because it's too high a price to pay."" Asked for his response to Ms Aldridge, Gen Carter told the Today programme he ""absolutely"" understood ""where the bereaved come from"". This video can not be played ""We have to live with our losses for the rest of our lives"" - mother Lucy Aldridge reflects on the loss of her son William ""All those who fought in Afghanistan can hold their heads up very high,"" he said. ""The British military was not defeated on the battlefield. They showed remarkable adaptability against a very cunning and nefarious opponent, and they showed phenomenal courage under great pressure. ""And, at the end of the day, we have prevented attacks like the one we saw from al-Qaeda on 9/11 ever occurring from Afghanistan in this intervening period, and I think there's no reason to suppose that that can't prevail."" At the height of the war, Nato had more than 130,000 troops from 50 nations in Afghanistan. The UK had 9,500 personnel and 137 bases in Helmand province alone. But with both the US and UK withdrawing their troops from Afghanistan, violence has been rising and the Taliban are thought to now control more than a third of the country's 400 districts. On Friday, Afghan officials said the Talibanhad captured a major border crossing between Afghanistan and Iran. Gen Carter said the Afghan army had made a strategic decision to withdraw from some rural parts of the country and concentrate forces on key urban areas. 20 years in Afghanistan: Was it worth it? Echoes of 1989 as foreign forces leave Afghanistan Biden defends US withdrawal amid Taliban advance Asked if he thought the almost two decades spent there had been a success or a failure, Gen Carter said it was ""too early to judge"" - and he saw three possible scenarios that could play out. ""I think, first and foremost, the current Afghan government, with its very well-trained army, could hold the ring, as it's demonstrating through holding all of the provincial capitals at the moment,"" he said. ""The second scenario - a very sad scenario - is where the country fractures and you see that government collapse, the Taliban perhaps controlling part of the country and the other nationalities and ethnicities controlling other parts of the country, like we saw in the 1990s. ""Then I think there is a third, more hopeful scenario, which is where you actually see a political compromise and talks occurring. ""If the current Afghan government holds on for long enough and proves to the Taliban it can't be defeated, then I think the third scenario becomes ever more likely."" Asked if the US and UK were abandoning their responsibilities by leaving, the general said both nations would maintain a ""diplomatic presence in Kabul for the foreseeable future"". He added the current Afghan army was the best the country had ever had, and that Afghan government institutions, including the army, would continue to receive support in the form of international funding. From 9/11, to intense fighting on the ground, and now full withdrawal of US-led forces, hereâs what happened. 11 September 2001 Al-Qaeda, led by Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan, carries out the largest terror attack ever conducted on US soil. Four commercial airliners are hijacked. Two are flown into the World Trade Centre in New York, which collapses. One hits the Pentagon building in Washington, and one crashes into a field in Pennsylvania. Nearly 3,000 people are killed. 7 October 2001 A US-led coalition bombs Taliban and al-Qaeda facilities in Afghanistan. Targets include Kabul, Kandahar and Jalalabad. The Taliban, who took power after a decade-long Soviet occupation was followed by civil war, refuse to hand over Bin Laden. Their air defences and small fleet of fighter aircraft are destroyed. 13 November 2001 The Northern Alliance, a group of anti-Taliban rebels backed by coalition forces, enters Kabul as the Taliban flee the city. By the 13 November 2001, all Taliban have either fled or been neutralised. Other cities quickly fall. 26 January 2004 After protracted negotiations at a “loya jirga” or grand assembly, the new Afghan constitution is signed into law. The constitution paves the way for presidential elections in October 2004. 7 December 2004 Hamid Karzai, the leader of the Popalzai Durrani tribe, becomes the first president under the new constitution. He serves two five-year terms as president. May 2006 British troops arrive in Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold in the south of the country. Their initial mission is to support reconstruction projects, but they are quickly drawn into combat operations. More than 450 British troops lose their lives in Afghanistan over the course of the conflict. 17 February 2009 US President Barack Obama approves a major increase in the number of troops sent to Afghanistan. At their peak, they number about 140,000. The so-called “surge” is modelled on US strategy in Iraq where US forces focussed on protecting the civilian population as well as killing insurgent fighters. 2 May 2011 The leader of al-Qaeda is killed in an assault by US Navy Seals on a compound in Abbottabad in Pakistan. Bin Ladenâs body is removed and buried at sea. The operation ends a 10-year hunt led by the CIA. Â The confirmation that Bin Laden had been living on Pakistani soil fuels accusations in the US that Pakistan is an unreliable ally in the war on terror. 23 April 2013 The founder of the Taliban, Mullah Mohammed Omar, dies. His death is kept secret for more than two years. According to Afghan intelligence, Mullah Omar dies of health problems at a hospital in the Pakistani city of Karachi. Pakistan denies that he was in the country. 28 December 2014 At a ceremony in Kabul, Nato ends its combat operations in Afghanistan. With the surge now over, the US withdraws thousands of troops. Â Most of those who remain focus on training and supporting the Afghan security forces. 2015 The Taliban launch a series of suicide attacks, car bombings and other assaults. The parliament building in Kabul, and the city of Kunduz are attacked. Islamic State militants begin operations in Afghanistan. 25 January 2019 Afghan President Ashraf Ghani says more than 45,000 members of his countryâs security forces have been killed since he became leader in 2014. The figure is far higher than previously thought. 29 February 2020 The US and the Taliban sign an “agreement for bringing peace” to Afghanistan, in Doha, Qatar. The US and Nato allies agree to withdraw all troops within 14 months if the militants uphold the deal. 13 April 2021 US president Joe Biden announces that all US troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September 2021. 16 August 2021 In just over a month, the Taliban sweep across Afghanistan, taking control of towns and cities all over the country, including Kabul. Afghan security forces collapse in the face of the Taliban advance.

Skydiving plane crash leaves nine dead in Sweden,"The plane was carrying eight skydivers and a pilot All nine people have died on board an aeroplane carrying skydivers, that crashed in Sweden, police say. The plane was carrying eight skydivers and a pilot when it crashed close to the runway at Orebro airport, about 160km (100 miles) west of Stockholm, on Thursday. The crash is thought to have happened as the plane was taking off. ""It's a very severe accident,"" Swedish police said on their website. ""Everyone on board the crashed plane has died."" The small propeller plane, a DHC-2 Beaver, had been rented by a local skydiving club for a summer event, local media reported. Prime Minister Stefan Lofven offered his condolences. ""It is with great sadness and sorrow that I have received the tragic information about the plane crash in Orebro,"" he tweeted. ""My thoughts are with the victims, their families and loved ones in this very difficult time."" In a similar incident in 2019, nine people diedwhen a plane carrying them for a parachute jump crashed in the north of the country soon after taking off.The crash investigation showed the plane had been improperly loaded.

Foreign hit squad killed Haiti president - police,"This video can not be played Haiti parades suspects after president's murder A group of 28 foreign mercenaries, including retired Colombian soldiers, assassinated Haiti's President Jovenel MoÃ¯se earlier this week, police say. After a gun battle in the capital Port-au-Prince, 17 were detained, some at the house they were using, others after entering Taiwan's diplomatic compound. Three suspects were killed by police and eight are still being sought. Bloodied and bruised, arrested suspects were shown to the media on Thursday, along with a slew of seized weapons. It is still unclear who organised the attack and with what motive. Also unclear is who is in charge of the country. On Friday, a group of political parties added to that uncertainty by nominating a president, although how much legitimacy that has is unknown. The attack took place in the early hours of Wednesday, when gunmen broke into the president's home in Port-au-Prince, shooting him dead and wounding his wife. Mr MoÃ¯se, 53, was found lying on his back with 12 bullet wounds and a gouged eye, according to authorities. Martine MoÃ¯se, 47, was seriously wounded and is in a stable condition after being flown to Florida for treatment. Police said the hit squad included mainly Colombians, along with two Haitian-Americans. Found in the suspects' possession were firearms, sets of US dollar bills, the president's personal chequebook and the server that held surveillance camera footage from his home, Le Nouvelliste newspaper reported. Taiwan confirmed that 11 of the suspects were arrested after breaking into a courtyard at its compound. What we know about the killing so far Angry civilians had joined the search for the gunmen, and helped police track down some who were hiding in bushes. The crowd set fire to three of the suspects' cars and destroyed evidence. Axes, wire-cutters, sets of US dollar bills and Colombian passports have been seized Police chief LÃ©on Charles called for calm, saying the public should not take the law into their own hands. At the news conference on Thursday, police showed reporters Colombian passports. ""Foreigners came to our country to kill the president,"" Mr Charles said, as the suspects sat on the floor behind him in handcuffs. Colombia's government has pledged to assist Haiti with its investigation efforts. Colombian police director, Gen Jorge Luis Vargas, said 17 former Colombian soldiers were thought to be involved. The US state department, meanwhile, said it could not confirm if any of its citizens had been detained. However, US and Canadian media are reporting that one of the dual citizens arrested, James Solages, 35, is from Florida and was a former bodyguard at the Canadian embassy in Haiti. An investigating judge told local media that Mr Solages and the other US citizen, named as Joseph Vincent, had said they were there as translators for the mercenaries, after finding the job on the internet. ""The mission was to arrest President Jovenel MoÃ¯se... and not to kill him,"" Judge ClÃ©ment NoÃ«l told Le Nouvelliste. The US said on Friday it was sending FBI and Department of Homeland Security officials to Haiti following the nation's request for help in the investigation. Members of Mr MoÃ¯se's security detail have been summoned before Haiti's courts to answer questions about its failures. Large crowds surrounded the PÃ©tion-Ville Police station in Port-au-Prince where the men have been detained Colombian daily El Tiempo said that it had seen confidential documents that named the Colombian suspects. The paper's research suggests that four of them flew from Colombia to the Dominican Republic on 4 June. They crossed by land from there into Haiti two days later. The two countries share the island of Hispaniola. According to El Tiempo, Colombian intelligence has seen photos posted on social media by members of the group, showing them posing at a popular tourist spot in the Dominican Republic. The killing has triggered some civil unrest in Haiti, the poorest nation in the Americas. A state of emergency remains in force across the country, while the Dominican Republic has closed its border. The situation has been unclear and is getting murkier. In this particular situation, the constitution says the National Assembly should choose another president. But disputes meant that elections scheduled for October 2019 did not take place - and Mr MoÃ¯se had been ruling by decree amid widespread protests. Amendments to the constitution - not accepted by everyone - suggest the prime minister should be the next one to take over. But Haiti has both an interim prime minister, Claude Joseph, and a new appointee, Ariel Henry, who has yet to be sworn in. Both are claiming to be in charge. On Friday, a group of political parties signed a resolution proclaiming a new president - Joseph Lambert - with Mr Henry acting as his PM. The situation is doing little to resolve the political and economic instability that has long plagued the nation.  11 millioninhabitants 59%percentage who live below the poverty line 2004-2017years in which a UN peacekeeping force was present 200,000number of people killed in the 2010 earthquake US charges four over Haiti president assassination Haiti's president killed in attack at home Dispute over Haiti presidency triggers unrest Why are there so many protests in Haiti?

Dua Lipa sued for sharing paparazzi photo,"The star has deleted the Instagram post in which she was alleged to have shared a copyrighted image Dua Lipa is being sued after allegedly putting a paparazzi photo of herself on Instagram. According to US court documents, the star was snapped queuing at an airport in February 2019 and later shared the shot with her fans ""without permission or authorisation"". Integral Images says Lipa profited from the photo, as her Instagram feed acts as a marketing tool for her music. It is seeking $150,000 (Â£108,000) damages and has asked for a jury trial. The company is also asking for an order preventing the singer from further acts of infringement, as well as legal costs. Lipa posted the photo to her Instagram account on 7 February 2019, about four days after it was taken. The now-deleted post shows the star standing in line, clutching her airline ticket and passport, while wearing an oversize hat, ""I'll be living under big fluffy hats until further notice,"" she wrote in the caption. Why some paparazzi are suing celebrities Integral Images had applied to register copyright for the images, and the request was granted on 20 February 2021 - after Lipa's Instagram post - according to records from the US Copyright Office. The company claims Lipa ""knowingly"" posted the photo to social media without permission, and stood to make money from the shot. Court documents obtained by the BBC claim her Instagram account is ""monetised in that it contains content designed to accumulate followers who are directed to, via link and/or advertisement, consume and purchase [her] content"". Lipa's team has been contacted for a response. The singer performed a medley of her hits at this year's Brits, going on to win two awards Although many people assume they can post an image in which they are the subject, copyright law means the photographer usually owns the rights. Lipa is not the first star to be sued for sharing paparazzi images of themselves to social media. Gigi Hadid, Liam Hemsworth and Khloe Kardashian have all faced similar cases, while in 2019 both Ariana Grande and Justin Bieber settled complaints brought by photographer Robert Barbera. In the same year, Jennifer Lopez was sued by the Splashy News and Picture Agency for posting a photo of herself and Alex Rodriguez to Instagram. The company later voluntarily dismissed the complaint with prejudice. Outside of the legal case Lipa is having a stellar year,winning best album at the Britsand best pop album at the Grammys for her lockdown antidote Future Nostalgia. She has also landed her first film role, starring alongside Henry Cavill, Sam Rockwell, Bryce Dallas Howard and Samuel L Jackson in the upcoming spy thriller Argylle. Lipa will also provide original music for the film's title track and score. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external.

"UK economic growth slows in MayDespite a boost from pubs and restaurants serving indoors, growth was below expectations.","The UK's economy grew more slowly than expected in May after a rebound in the hospitality sector was offset by disruptions to car production. The economy expanded by 0.8% in May as coronavirus restrictions eased to allow pubs and restaurants to serve indoors. While that was the fourth consecutive month of growth, it was also a slowdown from the 2% growth seen in April. The economy is still 3.1% below pre-pandemic levels,the Office for National Statistics said,external. ""Of course, the pace of the recovery was always going to slow as the economy climbed back towards its pre-crisis level. But we hadn't expected it to slow so much so soon,"" said Paul Dales, an economist with Capital Economics. What is GDP and how does it affect me? Will England's success boost the UK economy? House prices set to continue rising as supply shrinks Pubs and restaurants ""were responsible for the vast majority of the growth seen in May"", said Jonathan Athow, ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics ""Hotels also saw a marked recovery as restrictions lifted,"" he added. Accommodation and food services grew by a massive 37.1% in May, with the overall services sector growing 0.9%. But UK carmakers struggled with a shortage of microchips, with the manufacture of transport equipment falling by 16.5%. Construction firms were hit by very wet weather in May as firms lost working days, although the ONS said the sector remained 0.3% above February 2020's pre-pandemic level. British Chambers of Commerce head of economics Suren Thiru said: ""While the latest figures confirm the rebound in economic activity continued into May, the sharp slowdown in growth suggests that the recovery is losing a little steam as the temporary boost, from the earlier phases of reopening, fades."" Overall, in the three months to May, economic output rose by 3.6%, helped by strong retail sales, and as pubs, restaurants and schools reopened from March. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""The government is continuing to support the recovery, with the furlough scheme in place until September, and schemes like Restart helping people who have sadly lost their jobs get back into work."" Looking ahead, Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director at Fidelity International, said: ""A sporting summer may not directly cause an 'it's coming home' bounce, but the impact on consumer confidence can't be ignored. ""That being said, there are many unknowns ahead. The UK is set on its roadmap to 'freedom day' but cases are rising, challenges in the labour market persist and the initial spending boom could slow in pace."" After shrinking at the start of the year under renewed lockdowns, the economy is meant to be surging back. On a chart, a line graph looks like the second bounce of a precipitous economic bungee jump. In that light, today's figures are a disappointment. The consensus forecast was for growth of 1.5% in May. Instead we got barely half that - 0.8% - with activity in construction shrinking for the second month in a row and manufacturing also down. Some of that was down to one-off factors such as the shortage of microchips, which forced carmakers to send workers home. But while activity in restaurants and pubs jumped as customers were allowed inside for the first time in months, it's clear that our economic bungee cord is slackening before it was expected. The economy remains 3.1% below where it was in February last year, and no larger than it was in January 2017, making it one of the two weakest performers in the G20 group of advanced economies. In the UK, new GDP figures are produced every month, but the quarterly figures - covering three months at a time - are the most widely watched. In a growing economy, quarterly GDP will be slightly bigger than the quarter before, a sign that people are doing more work and getting (on average) a little bit richer. Most economists, politicians and businesses like to see GDP rising steadily. Rising GDP means more jobs are likely to be created, and workers are more likely to get better pay rises. If GDP is falling, then the economy is shrinking - bad news for businesses and workers. If GDP falls for two quarters in a row, that is known as a recession, which can mean pay freezes and lost jobs.

Aseparate statement,externalfrom the Office for National Statistics on trade figures showed that the UK is still importing more goods from outside the EU than from the bloc following Brexit. However, the difference is narrowing. The value of imports from non-EU countries were Â£20bn in May, while imports from the bloc - many of which face new barriers to cross-border trade - were Â£18.4bn, the ONS said. The value of goods exported to non-EU countries - Â£13.7bn - was also higher than to EU countries, at Â£12.9bn. How fast is the UK's economy growing?

House prices set to continue rising as supply shrinks Pubs and restaurants ""were responsible for the vast majority of the growth seen in May"", said Jonathan Athow, ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics ""Hotels also saw a marked recovery as restrictions lifted,"" he added. Accommodation and food services grew by a massive 37.1% in May, with the overall services sector growing 0.9%. But UK carmakers struggled with a shortage of microchips, with the manufacture of transport equipment falling by 16.5%. Construction firms were hit by very wet weather in May as firms lost working days, although the ONS said the sector remained 0.3% above February 2020's pre-pandemic level. British Chambers of Commerce head of economics Suren Thiru said: ""While the latest figures confirm the rebound in economic activity continued into May, the sharp slowdown in growth suggests that the recovery is losing a little steam as the temporary boost, from the earlier phases of reopening, fades."" Overall, in the three months to May, economic output rose by 3.6%, helped by strong retail sales, and as pubs, restaurants and schools reopened from March. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""The government is continuing to support the recovery, with the furlough scheme in place until September, and schemes like Restart helping people who have sadly lost their jobs get back into work."" Looking ahead, Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director at Fidelity International, said: ""A sporting summer may not directly cause an 'it's coming home' bounce, but the impact on consumer confidence can't be ignored. ""That being said, there are many unknowns ahead. The UK is set on its roadmap to 'freedom day' but cases are rising, challenges in the labour market persist and the initial spending boom could slow in pace."" After shrinking at the start of the year under renewed lockdowns, the economy is meant to be surging back. On a chart, a line graph looks like the second bounce of a precipitous economic bungee jump. In that light, today's figures are a disappointment. The consensus forecast was for growth of 1.5% in May. Instead we got barely half that - 0.8% - with activity in construction shrinking for the second month in a row and manufacturing also down. Some of that was down to one-off factors such as the shortage of microchips, which forced carmakers to send workers home. But while activity in restaurants and pubs jumped as customers were allowed inside for the first time in months, it's clear that our economic bungee cord is slackening before it was expected. The economy remains 3.1% below where it was in February last year, and no larger than it was in January 2017, making it one of the two weakest performers in the G20 group of advanced economies. In the UK, new GDP figures are produced every month, but the quarterly figures - covering three months at a time - are the most widely watched. In a growing economy, quarterly GDP will be slightly bigger than the quarter before, a sign that people are doing more work and getting (on average) a little bit richer. Most economists, politicians and businesses like to see GDP rising steadily. Rising GDP means more jobs are likely to be created, and workers are more likely to get better pay rises. If GDP is falling, then the economy is shrinking - bad news for businesses and workers. If GDP falls for two quarters in a row, that is known as a recession, which can mean pay freezes and lost jobs.

Aseparate statement,externalfrom the Office for National Statistics on trade figures showed that the UK is still importing more goods from outside the EU than from the bloc following Brexit. However, the difference is narrowing. The value of imports from non-EU countries were Â£20bn in May, while imports from the bloc - many of which face new barriers to cross-border trade - were Â£18.4bn, the ONS said. The value of goods exported to non-EU countries - Â£13.7bn - was also higher than to EU countries, at Â£12.9bn. How fast is the UK's economy growing?

A murder that sparked soul-searching,"Posters of Sarah Everard were shared widely ""Missing: Please Help Our dear friend Sarah Everard,"" read the posters that went up on south London streets and local social media forums in the days after the 33-year-old disappeared on her walk home in early March. It was concerning but such appeals are not exactly a rare sight, and the hope was that she would soon turn up safe and sound. But in the days that followed, as police put out a CCTV image of Sarah and gave details of her last known movements, concern grew to alarm, then dread, then fear, shock and sadness. Sarah Everard's journey from Clapham Common to Brixton had taken her through some of the capital's most populated, brightly-lit, and well-walked parts. Hundreds of people - many of them young women - tread those pavements every day and consider the streets in and around them home. As the police investigation ramped up, local women were warned to be careful about venturing out alone. When a police officer was arrested - and subsequently charged with Sarah's murder - the head of the Metropolitan Police Cressida Dick acknowledged that women in London and beyond ""will be worried and may well be feeling scared"", although she said for a woman to be abducted off the street was an ""incredibly rare"" event. Sarah Everard disappeared while walking along a busy road But the case had touched a nerve, particularly as walking is one of the few activities to have been allowed during Britain's coronavirus lockdown. Women across the country took to social media to discuss their own experiences of walking the streets and the lengths they went to to feel safe.Out poured stories of being followed, harassed, catcalled, assaulted and exposed to. Helena Wadia was one of those. She told BBC Radio 5 Live she wanted to highlight how common it was for women to feel unsafe. ""The first time I was catcalled I think I was about 12 years old,"" she said. ""I have been self-policing since then. We moderate everything - our clothing, our drinking. We get taxis where maybe we can't afford it. We hold keys between our fingers. We don't wear headphones when we're jogging. We stick to well-lit areas. It's exhausting."" One tweet asking women if they have ever faked phone calls, changed route, or even run in fear after feeling threatened by men in public spaces was liked more than 120,000 times. People even began sharing tips on what apps were out thereto help women stay safe. Flowers and messages have been lain in Clapham Common Anna Birley is one of many people in recent days to have underlined that the narrative around women's safety must change. ""What's so upsetting is it shouldn't be our problem,"" she told BBC Radio 5 Live. ""It's not our fault. Women aren't the reason women get attacked."" A vigil she helped plan at Clapham Common - one of several around the country - as a way of ""reclaiming our public spaces and coming together to feel a level of solidarity"" in itself became controversial when it resulted inclashes with police and women were seen being physically restrained. Several hundred people had turned up despite being told it had to be cancelled because it breached lockdown restrictions. The organisers had criticised the police for failing to ""constructively engage"" with them on efforts to make the event Covid-safe, instead of urging mourners to hold candle-lit vigils at home. The Metropolitan Police defended their actions at the Clapham vigil. They said they ""were placed in this position because of the overriding need to protect people's safety"", but have faced intense criticism from across the political spectrum. On International Women's Day every year, British MP Jess Phillips reads out the names of all the women and girls killed over the previous 12 months, where a man has been convicted or charged as the main perpetrator. This video can not be played Jess Phillips lists all women killed in the UK over the last year where a man has been convicted or charged. This year it fell on the day remains were found in the hunt for Sarah Everard, and she read out 118 names. ""Dead women is a thing we've all just accepted as part of our daily lives,"" Ms Phillips told Parliament. ""Killed women are not vanishingly rare. Killed women are common."" How many attacks on UK women are there? In a separate debate in the Lords, Parliament's upper chamber, Baroness Jenny Jones of Moulescoomb called for an 18:00 curfew for men on the streets. She later told Sky News that while she hadn't been ""entirely serious"", she wanted to make the point that ""when the police victim-blame by asking women to stay home, we don't react. We just think it's normal."" So what has been the response of men? As women took to social media to tell their stories, Stuart Edwards, who lives five minutes away from where Sarah went missing,tweeted,external: ""Aside from giving as much space as possible on quieter streets and keeping face visible, is there anything else men can reasonably do to reduce the anxiety/spook factor?"" The tweet received 27,000 likes and more than 3,000 retweets. Among those who joined the conversation was food critic Jay Rayner, who also lives in south London. ""If I find myself walking behind a single woman on a quiet street I always cross the road to the other side and ideally accelerate away as quickly as possible. I am a big man and absolutely aware what my silhouette looks like in the darkness,"" he tweeted. Some however have been keen to point out that it's a tiny minority of men who are attackers - using the hashtag #NotAllMen. But the issue of violence against women is not one for the UK alone. The World Health Organization this week published a report sayingone in three women globally, around 736 million, had been subjected to physical or sexual violence in their lifetimes. WHO Director General Dr Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus said violence against women was ""endemic in every country and culture"", and had been exacerbated by the coronavirus pandemic. ""Unlike Covid-19, violence against women cannot be stopped with a vaccine,"" he said, as the WHO called for more investment in services to help vulnerable women.

"Taliban capture key border crossing with IranIslam Qala border crossing point is seized, as the group swiftly advances in parts of Afghanistan.Asia","Afghan soldiers search a man at a checkpoint in Herat province. The army has lost ground to the Taliban. The Taliban have captured major border crossings with Iran and Turkmenistan in a sweeping offensive across northern Afghanistan, officials say. The militants say they seized two key border towns - Islam Qala near Iran, and Torghundi bordering Turkmenistan. Video footage appeared to show Taliban forces taking down the Afghan flag from the roof of a border customs office. The Taliban are rapidly retaking land across Afghanistan as the US-led mission removes the last of its troops. Taliban officials say their fighters have taken control of 85% of territory in Afghanistan - a claim impossible to independently verify and disputed by the government. Why is there a war in Afghanistan? Afghanistan withdrawal stokes fears of al-Qaeda comeback Other estimates have put the amount of territory the Taliban controls at more than a third of the country's 400 districts, including an arc of land from the Iranian border in the west to the frontier with China on the other side of the country. The Americans earlier this week quietly departed from Bagram airfield, a sprawling base that was the centre of US operations in Afghanistan and once held tens of thousands of troops. Afghan officials acknowledged the loss of the Islam Qala and Torghundi border crossings, both in Herat province. The Islam Qala crossing is one of the biggest trade gateways into Iran, generating an estimated $20m (Â£14m) in monthly revenue for the government. The Torghundi border town is one of two trade gateways into Turkmenistan. Afghan forces are trying to recapture the two border crossings, a government spokesperson said. ""All Afghan security forces including the border units are present in the area, and efforts are under way to recapture the site,"" interior ministry spokesman Tareq Arian told the AFP news agency. Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban, said the Islam Qala crossing was ""under our full control"". Reports said Taliban fighters had seized five districts in Herat without a fight.

Earlier this week, more than 1,000 members of the Afghan security forces fled into Tajikistan, which lies north-east of Afghanistan, as the Taliban advanced around them. Russia on Friday said the Taliban had taken control of about two-thirds of the Afghan-Tajik border in a swift advance. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Moscow was urging all sides in Afghanistan to ""show restraint"". The reports came hours after US President Joe Biden defended his administration's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan after 20 years of war. ""I will not send another generation of Americans to war in Afghanistan with no reasonable expectation of achieving a different outcome,"" Mr Biden said. He admitted it was ""highly unlikely"" the Afghan government would be able to control the entire country. This video can not be played Biden: 'We did not go to Afghanistan to nation build' Some US intelligence analysts fear the Taliban could seize control of the country within six months, according to an assessment distributed to officials in June. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has insisted that Afghan security forces are capable of keeping the Taliban at bay, and Afghan forces appear to have retaken lost ground in some areas. According to officials, troops on Wednesday recaptured government buildings in the western city of Qala-e-Naw - the first major provincial capital entered by the Taliban in their latest offensive. This video can not be played 'For Afghanistan's war to end, there has to be a political agreement' UK Chief of Defence Staff General Sir Nick Carter told the BBC's Today programme that one of three scenarios would likely unfold in Afghanistan. UK military not defeated in Afghanistan - general Firstly, the Afghan government could ""hold the ring, as it's demonstrating through holding all the provincial capitals at the moment"", he said. ""The second scenario I think is a very sad scenario, where the country fractures and you see the government collapse. You see the Taliban perhaps controlling part of the country, and the other nationalities and ethnicities controlling other parts of the country, like we saw in the 1990s,"" he said. ""A third, more hopeful, scenario, is where you actually see a political compromise and talks occurring. US operations in Afghanistan will officially end on 31 August, but the vast majority of foreign troops have already left."" Peace talks between the government and the Taliban continue, but the talks have regularly stalled and failed to progress significantly. From 9/11, to intense fighting on the ground, and now full withdrawal of US-led forces, hereâs what happened. 11 September 2001 Al-Qaeda, led by Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan, carries out the largest terror attack ever conducted on US soil. Four commercial airliners are hijacked. Two are flown into the World Trade Centre in New York, which collapses. One hits the Pentagon building in Washington, and one crashes into a field in Pennsylvania. Nearly 3,000 people are killed. 7 October 2001 A US-led coalition bombs Taliban and al-Qaeda facilities in Afghanistan. Targets include Kabul, Kandahar and Jalalabad. The Taliban, who took power after a decade-long Soviet occupation was followed by civil war, refuse to hand over Bin Laden. Their air defences and small fleet of fighter aircraft are destroyed. 13 November 2001 The Northern Alliance, a group of anti-Taliban rebels backed by coalition forces, enters Kabul as the Taliban flee the city. By the 13 November 2001, all Taliban have either fled or been neutralised. Other cities quickly fall. 26 January 2004 After protracted negotiations at a “loya jirga” or grand assembly, the new Afghan constitution is signed into law. The constitution paves the way for presidential elections in October 2004. 7 December 2004 Hamid Karzai, the leader of the Popalzai Durrani tribe, becomes the first president under the new constitution. He serves two five-year terms as president. May 2006 British troops arrive in Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold in the south of the country. Their initial mission is to support reconstruction projects, but they are quickly drawn into combat operations. More than 450 British troops lose their lives in Afghanistan over the course of the conflict. 17 February 2009 US President Barack Obama approves a major increase in the number of troops sent to Afghanistan. At their peak, they number about 140,000. The so-called “surge” is modelled on US strategy in Iraq where US forces focussed on protecting the civilian population as well as killing insurgent fighters. 2 May 2011 The leader of al-Qaeda is killed in an assault by US Navy Seals on a compound in Abbottabad in Pakistan. Bin Ladenâs body is removed and buried at sea. The operation ends a 10-year hunt led by the CIA. Â The confirmation that Bin Laden had been living on Pakistani soil fuels accusations in the US that Pakistan is an unreliable ally in the war on terror. 23 April 2013 The founder of the Taliban, Mullah Mohammed Omar, dies. His death is kept secret for more than two years. According to Afghan intelligence, Mullah Omar dies of health problems at a hospital in the Pakistani city of Karachi. Pakistan denies that he was in the country. 28 December 2014 At a ceremony in Kabul, Nato ends its combat operations in Afghanistan. With the surge now over, the US withdraws thousands of troops. Â Most of those who remain focus on training and supporting the Afghan security forces. 2015 The Taliban launch a series of suicide attacks, car bombings and other assaults. The parliament building in Kabul, and the city of Kunduz are attacked. Islamic State militants begin operations in Afghanistan. 25 January 2019 Afghan President Ashraf Ghani says more than 45,000 members of his countryâs security forces have been killed since he became leader in 2014. The figure is far higher than previously thought. 29 February 2020 The US and the Taliban sign an “agreement for bringing peace” to Afghanistan, in Doha, Qatar. The US and Nato allies agree to withdraw all troops within 14 months if the militants uphold the deal. 13 April 2021 US president Joe Biden announces that all US troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September 2021. 16 August 2021 In just over a month, the Taliban sweep across Afghanistan, taking control of towns and cities all over the country, including Kabul. Afghan security forces collapse in the face of the Taliban advance.

Doctors call for face masks to stay in healthcare,"Dr David Bailey said removing all rules on face coverings would be wrong for healthcare settings Face masks should still be used in healthcare settings, even if restrictions are eased elsewhere, the head of a doctors' group has said. The Welsh government is under pressure from some after Boris Johnson saidEnglish restrictions could end in July. British Medical Association Wales chairman, Dr David Bailey, said removing all rules would be the ""wrong way to go"" for healthcare settings. He called for ""flexibility"" over future face mask rules. Dr Bailey, a GP in Caerphilly, said he would continue to wear a mask in the supermarket and on public transport, but there was not a necessity to wear them outside. Dr Bailey said there were more clinically vulnerable and sick people in healthcare settings He said: ""I don't think we need to be perhaps quite as worried about it as we were six months ago because most of us are vaccinated and because there's much less likelihood of getting ill. ""So I think there does need to be a bit of flexibility and it looks likely that it won't be mandatory in the future."" Wales will have to adapt to Covid, minister says Why rising Covid rates may not mean lockdown Wales considering amber list vaccination plan Dr Bailey added that it was ""reasonable"" to reduce the amount of social distancing, but rejected a complete relaxation of the rules. The Welsh government will announce any changes to Covid rules at its next review on 15 July. ""I think we would certainly strongly suggest that would be the wrong way to go in healthcare settings,"" he said. ""It's important, I think, to make sure that in healthcare settings we do try and continue to use face coverings."" Concerns have been raised about potential different rules in England and Wales, particularly by businesses on the border. ""Face masks shouldn't cause any problem at all on the borders,"" he said, urging the Welsh government to be ""sensible and cautious"". Dr Bailey added: ""The things that don't actually impact on getting on with your life, why not do them anyway? ""They've been proven to help and there is still a lot of Covid in the community."" Wales' overall case rate has been increasing and was at 117 cases per 100,000 people on Thursday, which is still lower than all other UK nations and English regions. There has been a slight rise in the average number of patients with confirmed Covid in hospital beds. However, hospital admissions for patients with confirmed and suspected Covid remain low - a daily average of seven, which is 0.6% of all hospital admissions. GPs themselves have been starting to see more patients with Covid symptoms. The consultation rate - which has been one of the wider measures used by health officials to assess the progress of Covid - has risen to a level not seen since March, according to the most recent Public Health Wales figures.

NHS Covid app may change as rules change - ShappsThe transport secretary says the app's sensitivity may need to be reduced as restrictions change.UK,"This video can not be played Grant Shapps: 'As our restrictions change, the NHS app needs to change in line' The NHS Covid contact tracing app used in England and Wales may need to change as coronavirus restrictions change, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said. England ending the 1m-plus rule on 19 July may mean the app's sensitivity needs to be reduced, he said. The app detects the distance between users and the length of time spent in close proximity - currently 2m or less and more than 15 minutes. It comes amid a huge rise in alerts as infections surge. The system allows people who test positive to anonymously share their test result, triggering alerts for those detected as close contacts in the days before the test. Under current rules, those who receive an alert are asked to stay at home for up to 10 days, although the Department of Health said the app ""is, and always has been, advisory"" - unlike the requirement to isolate if you are contacted directly by NHS Test and Trace. Coronavirus restrictions are set to end on 19 July butthe requirement to self-isolate if you have had both vaccine doses will only stop on 16 August, raising fears thatmillions of people would be asked to self-isolate this summeras people mixed more. The hospitality industry and NHS trusts have warned MPs the knock-on effect for the economy and workplaces could be huge. What happens if I'm 'pinged' by the app? Amber list quarantine for fully vaccinated to end What are the travel rules if I've had both jabs? One possible solution could be to change the sensitivity of the app, so it would tell people to self-isolate only after closer and more prolonged contact. But sources at the app developers told the BBC they have not yet been asked to do this, although they are planning a change from 16 August when people would be able to record that they were fully vaccinated to turn off the self-isolation countdown timer. Mr Shapps told BBC Breakfast: ""As our restrictions change, of course the app needs to change. Things like replacing the 1m-plus rule on 19 July might well lead to a review of the way the app itself needs to function."" But he said the app was still ""very important as one of the tools in our armoury"". He said there were still large numbers of people downloading it and said he had not seen any data showing people were deleting it. The most recent figures for the last week of June show an extra 300,000 downloads, bringing the total to more than 26 million, but it is not known how many people are active users. ""It's in our interests as a society to carry on doing the things that protect each other,"" Mr Shapps said. Technically, it wouldn't be very difficult to tweak the app to make it less ""sensitive"" - the hard bit is working out exactly what those tweaks should be. Currently, two phones with the app installed, exchange a digital handshake, via bluetooth, every five minutes. It registers how far apart they are, and for how long. If one of those phones then goes on to report a positive Covid test, other phones who were two metres away or less, for a duration of 15 minutes during a 24 hour period, are likely to receive an isolation alert. As we have learned more about the virus, other factors have also been incorporated such as how infectious the person was likely to have been at the time the two phones were in close proximity. Changing those parameters would be straightforward. But fundamentally it's the volume of cases which are driving the volume of isolation alerts, not the app itself. In the last week of June there were 356,000 alerts, triggered by 61,000 positive test reports - that's about six app users isolating per Covid case. When you look at it like that, it doesn't sound so excessive. And because of the app's focus on privacy nobody, including the government, the police and the NHS knows who has been ""pinged"" - making it legally unenforceable. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he was concerned about the possible changes, saying weakening the app would undermine the track and trace system the government had spent billions on. He said: ""This feels like taking the batteries out of the smoke detector and that is never a good idea."" A Downing Street source stressed people were still being encouraged to self-isolate if they got an alert, adding the Department of Health's statement that the app was advisory was consistent with the government's message to ""act cautiously, especially as we know cases will rise"". Dr Jenny Harries, the head of the new UK Health Security Agency, told MPs on Thursday she was ""aware that people are choosing not to use the app"" when asked about concerns people have been deleting it to avoid being ""pinged"". Hinting at a change, she added there was ""work ongoing at the moment because it is entirely possible to tune the app to ensure that it is appropriate to the risk"". What are the holiday rules for Portugal, Malta and Spain? I'm fully jabbed, so do I have to self-isolate? How the England and Wales contact-tracing app works A source close to Health Secretary Sajid Javid told the BBC ""we are looking at the sensitivity of the app"" and pointed out the sensitivity had been changed before. But they did not say exactly what would change. At present, if two phones running the app are close for long enough, and one of the two users later shares a positive coronavirus test via the app, then the other will receive an alert. You can also use the app to ""check-in"" to venues so you can be notified of any positive cases you may have encountered there, although the requirement to check-in will be lifted in England when lockdown rules ease further on 19 July. A total of 496 venue alerts - which use the check-in data to alert people to potential contact with a positive case - were sent between 24 June and 30 June. But alerts for people coming into close contact with someone testing positive soared by more than 60% in the last week of June to 360,000. At the end of May, there were only 16,000 alerts in a week. A BBC analysis has estimated 4.5 million peoplecould be asked to self-isolatebetween this week and 16 August, as the number of infections continues to rise. The NHS Covid-19 app is used in England and Wales. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own powers to set coronavirus regulations andseparate test-and-trace programmes.

"NHS Covid app may change as rules change - ShappsThe transport secretary says the app's sensitivity may need to be reduced as restrictions change.UKWill Wales fans back England in Euro 2020 final?Wales exited at the last 16 stage, but England play Italy looking to be crowned European champions.Wales","This video can not be played Grant Shapps: 'As our restrictions change, the NHS app needs to change in line' The NHS Covid contact tracing app used in England and Wales may need to change as coronavirus restrictions change, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said. England ending the 1m-plus rule on 19 July may mean the app's sensitivity needs to be reduced, he said. The app detects the distance between users and the length of time spent in close proximity - currently 2m or less and more than 15 minutes. It comes amid a huge rise in alerts as infections surge. The system allows people who test positive to anonymously share their test result, triggering alerts for those detected as close contacts in the days before the test. Under current rules, those who receive an alert are asked to stay at home for up to 10 days, although the Department of Health said the app ""is, and always has been, advisory"" - unlike the requirement to isolate if you are contacted directly by NHS Test and Trace. Coronavirus restrictions are set to end on 19 July butthe requirement to self-isolate if you have had both vaccine doses will only stop on 16 August, raising fears thatmillions of people would be asked to self-isolate this summeras people mixed more. The hospitality industry and NHS trusts have warned MPs the knock-on effect for the economy and workplaces could be huge. What happens if I'm 'pinged' by the app? Amber list quarantine for fully vaccinated to end What are the travel rules if I've had both jabs? One possible solution could be to change the sensitivity of the app, so it would tell people to self-isolate only after closer and more prolonged contact. But sources at the app developers told the BBC they have not yet been asked to do this, although they are planning a change from 16 August when people would be able to record that they were fully vaccinated to turn off the self-isolation countdown timer. Mr Shapps told BBC Breakfast: ""As our restrictions change, of course the app needs to change. Things like replacing the 1m-plus rule on 19 July might well lead to a review of the way the app itself needs to function."" But he said the app was still ""very important as one of the tools in our armoury"". He said there were still large numbers of people downloading it and said he had not seen any data showing people were deleting it. The most recent figures for the last week of June show an extra 300,000 downloads, bringing the total to more than 26 million, but it is not known how many people are active users. ""It's in our interests as a society to carry on doing the things that protect each other,"" Mr Shapps said. Technically, it wouldn't be very difficult to tweak the app to make it less ""sensitive"" - the hard bit is working out exactly what those tweaks should be. Currently, two phones with the app installed, exchange a digital handshake, via bluetooth, every five minutes. It registers how far apart they are, and for how long. If one of those phones then goes on to report a positive Covid test, other phones who were two metres away or less, for a duration of 15 minutes during a 24 hour period, are likely to receive an isolation alert. As we have learned more about the virus, other factors have also been incorporated such as how infectious the person was likely to have been at the time the two phones were in close proximity. Changing those parameters would be straightforward. But fundamentally it's the volume of cases which are driving the volume of isolation alerts, not the app itself. In the last week of June there were 356,000 alerts, triggered by 61,000 positive test reports - that's about six app users isolating per Covid case. When you look at it like that, it doesn't sound so excessive. And because of the app's focus on privacy nobody, including the government, the police and the NHS knows who has been ""pinged"" - making it legally unenforceable. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he was concerned about the possible changes, saying weakening the app would undermine the track and trace system the government had spent billions on. He said: ""This feels like taking the batteries out of the smoke detector and that is never a good idea."" A Downing Street source stressed people were still being encouraged to self-isolate if they got an alert, adding the Department of Health's statement that the app was advisory was consistent with the government's message to ""act cautiously, especially as we know cases will rise"". Dr Jenny Harries, the head of the new UK Health Security Agency, told MPs on Thursday she was ""aware that people are choosing not to use the app"" when asked about concerns people have been deleting it to avoid being ""pinged"". Hinting at a change, she added there was ""work ongoing at the moment because it is entirely possible to tune the app to ensure that it is appropriate to the risk"". What are the holiday rules for Portugal, Malta and Spain? I'm fully jabbed, so do I have to self-isolate? How the England and Wales contact-tracing app works A source close to Health Secretary Sajid Javid told the BBC ""we are looking at the sensitivity of the app"" and pointed out the sensitivity had been changed before. But they did not say exactly what would change. At present, if two phones running the app are close for long enough, and one of the two users later shares a positive coronavirus test via the app, then the other will receive an alert. You can also use the app to ""check-in"" to venues so you can be notified of any positive cases you may have encountered there, although the requirement to check-in will be lifted in England when lockdown rules ease further on 19 July. A total of 496 venue alerts - which use the check-in data to alert people to potential contact with a positive case - were sent between 24 June and 30 June. But alerts for people coming into close contact with someone testing positive soared by more than 60% in the last week of June to 360,000. At the end of May, there were only 16,000 alerts in a week. A BBC analysis has estimated 4.5 million peoplecould be asked to self-isolatebetween this week and 16 August, as the number of infections continues to rise. The NHS Covid-19 app is used in England and Wales. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own powers to set coronavirus regulations andseparate test-and-trace programmes. On Thursday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak acknowledged there was ""frustration"" at how theNHS contact tracing appcould continue to order the double jabbed to isolate.

Sainsbury's stops selling CDs and DVDs,"The UK still buys Â£115m worth of CDs a year Supermarket giant Sainsbury's says it has decided to stop selling CDs and DVDs as streaming services take their toll on sales of the products. A spokesperson said Sainsbury's customers increasingly went for music and films online instead of buying the shiny silver discs. The firm said sales were being phased out, although it would continue to sell vinyl records in some stores. CD sales have shrunk in the past decade but were still worth Â£115m last year. Other big supermarkets show no sign of following Sainsbury's lead, with larger branches of Tesco, Asda and Morrisons still stocking a range of CDs and DVDs. ""Our customers increasingly go online for entertainment, so earlier this year we took the decision to gradually phase out the sale of DVDs and CDs, so that we can dedicate extra space to food and popular products like clothing and homewares,"" Sainsbury's said. The decision is another sign that the CD, once the dominant means of buying and selling recorded music, is long past its heyday. How vinyl records are trying to go green Classic bands accused of crowding out new music Streaming 'is threatening the future of music' 'People are hungry for new music after lockdown' With sales hit first by the MP3 music file, then by streaming services such as Spotify and Deezer, the silver disc is now seen as unfashionable in many circles. Worse still, the format that it was designed to kill off, the vinyl record, has enjoyed a resurgence, with UK sales climbing to 4.8 million last year, bringing inrevenue of more than Â£86m,external. That was still well short of the money brought in by CDs. But according to the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), the value of record sales in 2021 is expected to surpass that of CDs for the first time since the late 1980s. ""The CD has proved exceptionally successful for nearly 40 years and remains a format of choice for many music fans who value sound quality, convenience and collectability,"" said a BPI spokesperson. ""Although demand has been following a long-term trend as consumers increasingly transition to streaming, resilient demand is likely to continue for many years, enhanced by special editions and other collectible releases. ""If some retailers now see the format as less of a priority, this will create a further opportunity for others, such as independent shops and specialist chains such as HMV, to cater to the continuing demand."" Music industry observer Graham Jones points out that supermarkets have always carried a very limited selection of CDs, with an emphasis on big names such as Ed Sheeran. But as his book Last Shop Standing makes clear, the supermarkets could still make life difficult for record shops, especially by undercutting them on price. In one chapter, he recounts an incident from 2008, when a shop in the East Midlands found that rather than ordering copies of the latest Coldplay CD from the record company, it was cheaper to buy them on special offer from Morrisons and Asda and resell them. However, such incidents are unlikely to be repeated these days. ""Sales of CDs are slowing down, so I can understand why Sainsbury's are pulling out, really,"" he told the BBC. ""Vinyl is incredibly fashionable and the CD has gone out of fashion. ""A lot of indies [independent shops] may be stocking less CDs than they used to, but they're still selling. There's this myth that the CD is completely dead.""

Fury tests positive for coronavirus,"Fury and Wilder drew in December 2018 before the Briton landed a win in February 2020 The trilogy fight between Tyson Fury and Deontay Wilder in Las Vegas on 24 July has been postponed after the Briton tested positive for coronavirus. A source close to Fury told BBC Sport the WBC world heavyweight champion was deeply frustrated by the situation. Fury tested positive on Thursday and after discussions with medical experts the fight was called off - it is likely to be rescheduled for October. Wilder's manager Shelly Finkel said: ""Deontay is disappointed."" The WBC have confirmed the postponement, while an official announcement from the promoters Top Rank is expected later on Friday. Fury beat Wilder to become WBC champion in February 2020 - 14 months after the pair shared a thrilling draw in Los Angeles. Neither man has fought since Fury's victory in Las Vegas. After a third fight fell through several times because of complications around the Covid-19 pandemic, Fury sought to move on and face fellow Briton Anthony Joshua, who holds the other three significant titles at heavyweight. But an arbitration hearing ruled Wilder had contractual grounds for a third contest. Fury is unbeaten in his 31 fights, while Wilder has just one defeat in 44 outings. BBC boxing correspondent Mike Costello said the delay ""also jeopardises the chances of Fury taking on Anthony Joshua later this year in a unification showdown"". He added: ""Joshua's team have been negotiating with the Ukrainian Oleksandr Usyk about a possible contest in September.""

Met PC pleads guilty to Sarah Everard murder,"The body of Sarah Everard was found hidden in woodland Met Police officer Wayne Couzens has pleaded guilty to the murder of Sarah Everard. The firearms officer snatched her as she walked home from a friend's house in Clapham on 3 March, driving her away in a car he had hired. The 33-year-old's body was found a week later in woodland near Ashford, Kent, metres from land owned by Couzens. She had been raped and strangled. Couzens, 48, will be sentenced at the Old Bailey on 29 September. Met Commissioner Dame Cressida Dick was in court when Couzens pleaded guilty. Sarah Everard: Daughter, sister, friend and colleague Speaking outside the Old Bailey, Dame Cressida said she felt ""sickened, angered and devastated"" by his crimes. She added: ""They are dreadful and everyone in policing feels betrayed. ""Sarah was a fantastic, talented young woman with her whole life ahead of her and that has been snatched away."" The Independent Office for Police Conduct said on Friday that a total of 12 gross misconduct or misconduct notices had so far been served on police officers from multiple forces in relation to the Couzens case,including about the handling of two separate claims that Couzens had indecently exposed himself. This video can not be played Commissioner Cressida Dick: ""All of us in the Met are sickened, angered and devastated"" Prosecutor Tom Little QC told the court that Couzens and marketing executive Ms Everard had been ""total strangers to each other"". On the night Ms Everard was snatched, she and Couzens were seen on camera standing by his hire car. It was parked on the pavement with its hazard lights flashing. Wayne Couzens had previously pleaded guilty to kidnap and rape Couzens drove them out of London to Tilmanstone, near Deal in Kent. Investigators were able to track the route he took using CCTV and identified the driver through the car hire firm. The police constable had made the booking in his own name, picking up the Vauxhall Astra on the afternoon of the abduction and returning it the next morning. He was arrested on 9 March, only minutes after he had wiped the data from his mobile phone. In Court 12 of the Old Bailey five members of Sarah Everard's family sat listening as police officer Wayne Couzens pleaded guilty to her murder. On video-link from Belmarsh Prison he kept his head down and was shaking slightly. As the barrister representing Couzens said his guilty plea was a sign of his remorse and the burden he would have to bear, Sarah's mother raised her hands. It seemed as if she was saying that wasn't much comfort now. The Met Police Commissioner Cressida Dick was also in court. Her force caught the murderer, only to discover it was one of her own officers. Questions remain for the Met Police. Sarah Everard was described as ""beautiful, thoughtful and incredibly kind"" In his police interview, Couzens said he had got into trouble with a gang of Eastern Europeans who threatened him and his family. They demanded he deliver ""another girl"" after he had underpaid a prostitute a few weeks before, the firearms officer said. He claimed he kidnapped Ms Everard, drove out of London and handed her over to three men in a van in a layby in Kent, while she was alive and uninjured. Ms Everard's family was in court for Couzens' guilty plea Meanwhile, police found out that Couzens and his wife owned a small patch of woodland in Ashford. Phone data led officers to the site and Ms Everard's body was found just outside the property boundary the day after Couzens' arrest. Couzens entered his guilty plea via video-link from Belmarsh Prison Ms Everard was abducted by the police officer while walking along a busy road On Friday, Couzens' defence barrister told the court his client's admission of murder ""represents a truly guilty plea and remorse for what he did and, as he put it to us this morning, he will bear the burden for the rest of his life - his words - 'as I deserve'."" Judge Lord Justice Fulford - who before adjourning the case discussed legal precedents for whole-life prison sentences - told the court: ""This has been a mammoth investigation which has produced some very significant results in terms of being able to understand what happened."" Met PC admits raping and kidnapping Sarah Everard How a woman's death sparked UK soul-searching Speaking after the conviction, the Crown Prosecution Service's Carolyn Oakley said: ""Wayne Couzens lied to the police when he was arrested and to date, he has refused to comment. ""We still do not know what drove him to commit this appalling crime against a stranger. ""Today is a day to remember Sarah and our thoughts remain with her family and friends.""

"I'm fully jabbed, do I self-isolate?","The latest Covid booster campaign is under way across the UK and those who qualify are urged to get jabbed as soon as possible. No Covid restrictions are in place across the UK, but guidance recommends people who catch the virus ""should try to stay at home"".

WHO charts rapid spread of new JN.1 Covid variant Why Covid is still flooring some people Between 2% and 20% of people catching Covidgo on to have longer-term symptoms, ""long Covid"", research suggests.

Taliban capture key border crossing with Iran,"Afghan soldiers search a man at a checkpoint in Herat province. The army has lost ground to the Taliban. The Taliban have captured major border crossings with Iran and Turkmenistan in a sweeping offensive across northern Afghanistan, officials say. The militants say they seized two key border towns - Islam Qala near Iran, and Torghundi bordering Turkmenistan. Video footage appeared to show Taliban forces taking down the Afghan flag from the roof of a border customs office. The Taliban are rapidly retaking land across Afghanistan as the US-led mission removes the last of its troops. Taliban officials say their fighters have taken control of 85% of territory in Afghanistan - a claim impossible to independently verify and disputed by the government. Why is there a war in Afghanistan? Afghanistan withdrawal stokes fears of al-Qaeda comeback Other estimates have put the amount of territory the Taliban controls at more than a third of the country's 400 districts, including an arc of land from the Iranian border in the west to the frontier with China on the other side of the country. The Americans earlier this week quietly departed from Bagram airfield, a sprawling base that was the centre of US operations in Afghanistan and once held tens of thousands of troops. Afghan officials acknowledged the loss of the Islam Qala and Torghundi border crossings, both in Herat province. The Islam Qala crossing is one of the biggest trade gateways into Iran, generating an estimated $20m (Â£14m) in monthly revenue for the government. The Torghundi border town is one of two trade gateways into Turkmenistan. Afghan forces are trying to recapture the two border crossings, a government spokesperson said. ""All Afghan security forces including the border units are present in the area, and efforts are under way to recapture the site,"" interior ministry spokesman Tareq Arian told the AFP news agency. Zabihullah Mujahid, a spokesman for the Taliban, said the Islam Qala crossing was ""under our full control"". Reports said Taliban fighters had seized five districts in Herat without a fight.

Earlier this week, more than 1,000 members of the Afghan security forces fled into Tajikistan, which lies north-east of Afghanistan, as the Taliban advanced around them. Russia on Friday said the Taliban had taken control of about two-thirds of the Afghan-Tajik border in a swift advance. Russian foreign ministry spokeswoman Maria Zakharova said Moscow was urging all sides in Afghanistan to ""show restraint"". The reports came hours after US President Joe Biden defended his administration's decision to withdraw from Afghanistan after 20 years of war. ""I will not send another generation of Americans to war in Afghanistan with no reasonable expectation of achieving a different outcome,"" Mr Biden said. He admitted it was ""highly unlikely"" the Afghan government would be able to control the entire country. This video can not be played Biden: 'We did not go to Afghanistan to nation build' Some US intelligence analysts fear the Taliban could seize control of the country within six months, according to an assessment distributed to officials in June. Afghan President Ashraf Ghani has insisted that Afghan security forces are capable of keeping the Taliban at bay, and Afghan forces appear to have retaken lost ground in some areas. According to officials, troops on Wednesday recaptured government buildings in the western city of Qala-e-Naw - the first major provincial capital entered by the Taliban in their latest offensive. This video can not be played 'For Afghanistan's war to end, there has to be a political agreement' UK Chief of Defence Staff General Sir Nick Carter told the BBC's Today programme that one of three scenarios would likely unfold in Afghanistan. UK military not defeated in Afghanistan - general Firstly, the Afghan government could ""hold the ring, as it's demonstrating through holding all the provincial capitals at the moment"", he said. ""The second scenario I think is a very sad scenario, where the country fractures and you see the government collapse. You see the Taliban perhaps controlling part of the country, and the other nationalities and ethnicities controlling other parts of the country, like we saw in the 1990s,"" he said. ""A third, more hopeful, scenario, is where you actually see a political compromise and talks occurring. US operations in Afghanistan will officially end on 31 August, but the vast majority of foreign troops have already left."" Peace talks between the government and the Taliban continue, but the talks have regularly stalled and failed to progress significantly. From 9/11, to intense fighting on the ground, and now full withdrawal of US-led forces, hereâs what happened. 11 September 2001 Al-Qaeda, led by Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan, carries out the largest terror attack ever conducted on US soil. Four commercial airliners are hijacked. Two are flown into the World Trade Centre in New York, which collapses. One hits the Pentagon building in Washington, and one crashes into a field in Pennsylvania. Nearly 3,000 people are killed. 7 October 2001 A US-led coalition bombs Taliban and al-Qaeda facilities in Afghanistan. Targets include Kabul, Kandahar and Jalalabad. The Taliban, who took power after a decade-long Soviet occupation was followed by civil war, refuse to hand over Bin Laden. Their air defences and small fleet of fighter aircraft are destroyed. 13 November 2001 The Northern Alliance, a group of anti-Taliban rebels backed by coalition forces, enters Kabul as the Taliban flee the city. By the 13 November 2001, all Taliban have either fled or been neutralised. Other cities quickly fall. 26 January 2004 After protracted negotiations at a “loya jirga” or grand assembly, the new Afghan constitution is signed into law. The constitution paves the way for presidential elections in October 2004. 7 December 2004 Hamid Karzai, the leader of the Popalzai Durrani tribe, becomes the first president under the new constitution. He serves two five-year terms as president. May 2006 British troops arrive in Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold in the south of the country. Their initial mission is to support reconstruction projects, but they are quickly drawn into combat operations. More than 450 British troops lose their lives in Afghanistan over the course of the conflict. 17 February 2009 US President Barack Obama approves a major increase in the number of troops sent to Afghanistan. At their peak, they number about 140,000. The so-called “surge” is modelled on US strategy in Iraq where US forces focussed on protecting the civilian population as well as killing insurgent fighters. 2 May 2011 The leader of al-Qaeda is killed in an assault by US Navy Seals on a compound in Abbottabad in Pakistan. Bin Ladenâs body is removed and buried at sea. The operation ends a 10-year hunt led by the CIA. Â The confirmation that Bin Laden had been living on Pakistani soil fuels accusations in the US that Pakistan is an unreliable ally in the war on terror. 23 April 2013 The founder of the Taliban, Mullah Mohammed Omar, dies. His death is kept secret for more than two years. According to Afghan intelligence, Mullah Omar dies of health problems at a hospital in the Pakistani city of Karachi. Pakistan denies that he was in the country. 28 December 2014 At a ceremony in Kabul, Nato ends its combat operations in Afghanistan. With the surge now over, the US withdraws thousands of troops. Â Most of those who remain focus on training and supporting the Afghan security forces. 2015 The Taliban launch a series of suicide attacks, car bombings and other assaults. The parliament building in Kabul, and the city of Kunduz are attacked. Islamic State militants begin operations in Afghanistan. 25 January 2019 Afghan President Ashraf Ghani says more than 45,000 members of his countryâs security forces have been killed since he became leader in 2014. The figure is far higher than previously thought. 29 February 2020 The US and the Taliban sign an “agreement for bringing peace” to Afghanistan, in Doha, Qatar. The US and Nato allies agree to withdraw all troops within 14 months if the militants uphold the deal. 13 April 2021 US president Joe Biden announces that all US troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September 2021. 16 August 2021 In just over a month, the Taliban sweep across Afghanistan, taking control of towns and cities all over the country, including Kabul. Afghan security forces collapse in the face of the Taliban advance.

Pandemic leaves councils with Â£3bn black hole,"UK councils face a Â£3bn black hole in their budgets as they emerge from the pandemic, a BBC investigation into their finances can reveal. Some local authorities were struggling to carry out statutory duties and were at risk of bankruptcy, a local government expert said. And 10 councils have asked to borrow Â£300m of emergency money from the government to plug financial holes. The government says it has handed councils Â£12bn during the pandemic. A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) said: ""In the coming months, we will take stock of the demands faced by councils and the resources available to meet them and will decide on the timetable for future fundingâ¯reform."" The spokesman claimed there were a small number of councils that were ""in severe financial distress such as Croydon and Slough due to poor leadership and chronic financial mismanagement, long predating the pandemic. ""These councils have badly let down their residents."" Analysing 170 upper-tier and single tier councils in the UK the BBC Shared Data Unit found: UK local authorities plan to make at least Â£1.7bn worth of savings in the 2021-22 financial year while also using more than Â£500m worth of reserves to balance the books A quarter of those savings - some Â£434m - will be made in adult social care departments, which provide support to the elderly and vulnerable Despite making the cuts, local authorities predict a Â£3bn shortfall in their budgets by 2023-24 Nearly 60% of councils in England have risen council tax by the new statutory maximum of 4.99% to compensate for losses, a rise of about Â£100 on a yearly Band D bill in many areas Savings will see the threshold for which disabled or elderly individuals can receive care raised, bus services scrapped and children's centres closed in parts of the UK. Fees and charges for parking, planning and crematoria are set to rises in places. In the London borough of Bexley, 264 staff posts will be deleted, while library opening hours and road repairs will be reduced. Sharon Taylor, a Labour councillor who chairs the Local Government Association's resources board, said the pandemic had highlighted an existing funding crisis brought about by a reduction in central government grants - a fall of up to 70% over ten years in some places. She said ""Cuts to local government hurt people and they hurt the everyday services people see when they walk outside their door."" Council budgets have been stretched for some time, but for many the pandemic has exacerbated the problem. It's increased the amount local authorities have had to spend on supporting their communities, and at the same time hit income streams hard. This new BBC analysis lays bare the scale of the challenge facing councils across the UK, and spells out some of the cuts to services planned for this year - as well further shortfalls predicted. Westminster and the devolved governments have provided extra money, which has been welcomed by local authorities. But what many in the sector really want is a new, more sustainable way of funding councils and the services they provide - not least social care. The government has promised reform; for local authorities it can't come too soon. Since the start of the pandemic, councils have been asked to provide extra services, such as home food deliveries for those shielding, finding accommodation for street sleepers and, in some cases, helping with the test and trace initiative. They have also had to supply workers with Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). But, at the same time they have seen income from things such as town centre parking, council tax and business rates plummet. In many cases, councils have also lost revenue from private investments. Authorities in Luton, Manchester and the West Midlands part-own airports, where passenger flights have been largely grounded during the pandemic. Croydon Council, which borrowed Â£545m to make a series of investments including a shopping centre and a hotel, saw the latter go into administration in June 2020. The authority effectively declared itself bankrupt in November 2020. Between 2016 and 2020, councils invested more than Â£7.6bn into commercial properties, a third of which were retail properties, according to the National Audit Office. Ms Taylor said the government had encouraged councils to invest in commercial property to raise funds. She said: ""[It] seems to have a very ambiguous attitude towards that now, and is saying those investments were down to us and if we've lost income they are not going to make up for those losses."" Chair of the public accounts committee Dame Meg Hillier MP said some councils had made ""risky choices"" at the expense of the taxpayer. But she also said the committee was generally critical of the MHCLG policy and its ""lack of understanding about councils' exposure to risk"". Last week, Slough Council issued a Section 114 notice, becoming the third council in four years to effectively declare itself bankrupt. The authority was one of 9 in England to have applied for a capitalisation direction, an emergency measure allowing a council to either borrow money to cover losses or to move funds from its building programme to fund day-to-day expenses. Around Â£290m is to be issued to councils, all of which will have to be repaid over a period of time. Croydon Council asked for the most support from the scheme - worth Â£120m over the next two years. Nottingham City Council, which placed its power company, Robin Hood Energy, into administration in January,  is set to borrow Â£35m. Other councils seeking financial support are Wirral, Peterborough, Bexley, Eastbourne, Luton and Copeland. Redcar and Cleveland said it had sought a government grant following a ransomware attack by hackers which affected its computer network. In Croydon, residents said they were feeling the effects of council cuts. Earlier this year, the residents of Regina Road said they had so much black mould in their council-owned properties it was a risk to their health. Others said they went days without electricity, or burst pipes that spilled sewage into living spaces. Months before, in November, the council had issued a section 114 notice, limiting itself to only essential spending, as it seeks to make Â£45m of cuts. Croydon residents have complained at the state of the ground-keeping Some residents were not able to find graves at a cemetery as the reduction to grounds maintenance had allowed the grass to grow over the headstones, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Elizabeth Ash, a Croydon resident of 25 years and part of a campaign to stop the council closing five libraries, said the state of services was causing some people to consider moving out of the south London borough. ""The graffiti services have all but stopped now,"" she said. ""There's been a proliferation of tagging on people's properties. All of these things have a knock-on effect in the community."" ""We don't have money to waste but it keeps getting wasted. The residents have to live with the fallout from it."" Councillor Hamida Ali, leader of the council, said she was ""serious about tackling (the) financial situation, improving how Croydon is run and providing good value services for residents"". Prof Arianna Giovannini said the pandemic had created a ""postcode lottery"" in council services Arianna Giovannini is deputy director of the Local Governance Research Centre (LGRC) based at De Montfort University. She said the pandemic had ""deepened regional inequalities"" - particularly in England - by pushing financially burdened councils into further difficulty. She said: ""The pandemic has forced councils to think the unthinkable.  We are in a position where some councils are struggling to continue to deliver just the statutory services."" An MHCLG spokesperson said: ""We've given councils over Â£8.9bn in response to specific pressures from the pandemic - that's over Â£2bn more than they told us in the detailed reporting they have provided that they spent last year to tackle Covid-19. We have already provided Â£3bn in additional funding for this year."" The Welsh government said it had provided councils with Â£1.4bn to ensure services did not bear the brunt of the financial impact of the pandemic. The Scottish government said its support package totalled more than Â£1.5bn. A spokesman said: ""However, our ability to go further in supporting the recovery is limited and our calls to the UK Government for additional fiscal powers have so far gone unheeded."" The Northern Ireland Executive said it had provided an additional Â£85m of funding to councils, adding that it considered the financial situation of local authorities to be ""generally satisfactory"".

"Care workers lose out on Â£7,000 pay, charity says","Care worker Aimee, 22, supports Tony, who has complex needs Frontline social care workers are being paid thousands of pounds less than other workers with equivalent skills, a charity claims. Community Integrated Care said teaching assistants and police community support workers have similar skillsets but on average receive Â£7,000 more per year. It is calling for an ""immediate and fair"" rise, saying the status quo is ""immoral"" and ""cannot be justified"". The government said it was committed to improving the adult social care system. The charity, one of Britain's biggest care providers, commissioned consultancy firm Korn Ferry to analyse public sector roles and compare pay rates. Social care reform: What are the sticking points? Social care needs fixing now, say council leaders Their report, Unfair to Care,,externalputs support workers in the same skills league as healthcare assistants, police community support officers and senior classroom assistants. But it also finds a large pay gap. For example, support workers in England who assist people to live independently in the community are paid on average Â£17,695 a year, the researchers found. But other public sector roles, with equivalent scope, complexity and accountability pay on average Â£24,602. This rises to Â£25,142, for equivalent roles in the NHS, the study found - a discrepancy of almost Â£7,500 a year. This leaves many social care workers living in poverty and is largely to blame for 112,000 unfilled vacancies in the sector, says the charity. Long hours, low pay and low recognition - a combination that makes it unsurprising that care providers struggle to find and keep staff. Supermarkets or shops often pay more. It angers care staff when they are described as low skilled and the new research underlines the complexity of the roles they take on. This video can not be played Two carers reflect on their passion for the job despite feeling underpaid. Working at a care home is ""so much more"" than ""making tea and wiping bums"", care team leader Lucy Jantschenko says. The 25-year-old, who works at a care home in Nottinghamshire, says workers also need the ability to be quick-thinking when things go wrong. ""Someone starts choking halfway through mealtime and you've got the nurse upstairs sorting out tablets, you're the only person there that can save them,"" she says. She says all care workers ""make such a big difference every day"" but adds: ""Then some days I've had an awful day, I've got home, I've only made Â£10.30 an hour when I could have been at Lidl stacking shelves for Â£12.50 an hour."" Aimme Murray supports adults with learning disabilities and physical disabilities who have complex needs in Leicestershire. The 22-year-old says the job requires her to ""be on the ball consistently"" - sorting out the right medication and liaising with GPs and family members are among her tasks. ""I get paid the minimum wage, not the living wage because that's higher than what I get paid,"" she says. ""If the pay isn't addressed and things don't change, I can't see many people staying in this job."" The researchers say their analysis demonstrates how the role of social care workers has changed in the past decade, ""as the sector increasingly supports people with highly complex health and care needs"". These days, says the study, care workers must frequently : Support and understand complex medical and behavioural needs Deliver medication and medical procedures Have well developed soft skills, like empathy and tact Show exceptional levels of personal accountability ""It is a matter of national shame that social care workers, who provide such an invaluable service to society, are in such desperate circumstances,"" says Community Integrated Care chief executive Mark Adams. The charity is urging Boris Johnson to live up to a promise made when he first became prime minister, almost two years ago,to fix the crisis in social care once and for all. To do that, the long-awaited reforms will need to address staffing, as well as how care is paid for in the long term. With an ageing population and more adults under 65 living with disabilities, the pressures on the care system are increasing. It is propped up by many dedicated staff, who do a good job, but there is also care which is poor. Experts maintain that to ensure quality support for anyone who needs it, it will take a workforce that is well trained and properly rewarded for the difference they can make to people's lives. Oonagh Smyth, chief executive of Skills for Care, the strategic body for workforce development in adult social care in England, warns that reform policies ""will not be successful unless they address the needs of the workforce"". Former care minister Phil Hope, co-chair of Future Social Care Coalition, added that it was ""time for the government to respect, reward and regulate, to support all those on the forgotten frontline'. ""It has never been clearer that they warrant and deserve a fair deal."" The Department of Health and Social Care said in a statement the social care sector ""has been an essential and valued part of the front line response to the pandemic"". The government has ""sought to protect the workforce and those receiving social care"", the statement said, by providing more than Â£2bn for the sector including infection prevention and control measures and PPE. ""We are committed to the sustainable improvement of the adult social care system and, as set out in the Queen's Speech, we will bring forward proposals later this year to ensure every person receives the care they need, provided with the dignity they deserve,"" the statement added.

The government confirmed large events like festivals could run after restrictions ease on 19 July Last year, the coronavirus pandemic wiped out theUK's summer festival season.Only a handful of shows were able to take place, and most of them were in car parks or socially-distanced green field sites. But the Reading Festival has now come one step closer to going ahead this summerafter the local council granted its event licence. It comes after the government confirmed Covid restrictions would end on 19 July, meaning large events like festivals could run. Reading Borough Council said there would need to be ""detailed consideration"" on how to minimise the risk of coronavirus. The festival - which was cancelled last year due to the pandemic - is expected to take place from 27 to 29 August this year. The line-up for this year's event is set to include Stormzy, Catfish & The Bottlemen, Post Malone, Disclosure, Liam Gallagher and Queens of the Stone Age. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Heart inflammation has been found to be a ""very rare"" side-effect of the coronavirus vaccinesmade by Pfizer and Moderna, according to the European Medicines Agency. Europe's watchdog said the side-effects were more common in younger men. It added that the benefits of Covid-19 vaccines continue to far outweigh any risks but advised doctors and patients to be aware of the symptoms of heart inflammation. These include chest pain, a feeling of breathlessness and a pounding or fluttering heartbeat. Anyone with these symptoms should see a doctor. Two conditions were linked to the vaccines - inflammation of the heart muscle itself, known as myocarditis, and inflammation of the fluid-filled sac the heart sits in, known as pericarditis. Five people died. The review said they were all either elderly or had other health conditions. The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has also been investigating the link. Myocarditis and pericarditis will be officially listed as side-effects in the UK and Europe, mirroring a move by the regulators in the US last month. Peter MwaiBBC Reality Check The World Health Organization (WHO) has warned that a third wave of Covid-19 cases in Africa could get worse as new and faster spreading variants like Delta drive infections. New weekly cases have now overtaken the weekly numbersrecorded at the height of the second wave in January this year and less than 2% of the continent has been fully vaccinated. ""The worst is yet to come as the fast-moving third wave continues to gain speed and new ground,"" says Matshidiso Moeti, WHO regional director for Africa. More than 251,000 new cases were recorded in the week ending 4 July, making it the ""worst pandemic week ever"", he says. The WHO believes the spread of the Delta variant - which is more transmissible - has contributed to an increase in both cases and deaths across the continent. Covid vaccines are highly effective in people with underlying health conditionswho were advised to shield earlier in the pandemic, real-world UK data reveals. The study,externalof more than a million people in at-risk groups shows two doses of the Pfizer or AstraZeneca vaccines are needed for this protection. Being double-jabbed reduced the risk of symptomatic Covid-19 by around 90%. One dose cut it by about 60%, says Public Health England (PHE). Protection against hospitalisation and death in at-risk groups is expected to be greater than protection against symptomatic disease, as has been seen in studies of the general population, although more data is needed to confirm this. Dr Mary Ramsay, head of immunisation at PHE, said: ""This real-world data shows for the first time that most people who are clinically vulnerable to Covid-19 still receive high levels of protection after two doses of vaccine."" Michael Andrew said he did not want to risk taking time off training because of any side effects US swimmer Michael Andrew, a gold medal favourite at the Olympics, said
he has not been vaccinated and has no plans to do so before the Tokyo Games, which begin on 23 July. Andrew, 22, told reporters he did not
want to risk taking time off training because of any vaccine side effects. ""I didn't want to put anything in my body that I didn't
know how I would potentially react to,"" he said. Andrew is the most prominent US athlete so far to
reveal vaccine hesitancy. There is no provision demanding Olympic athletes to
be vaccinated, even amid concerns about the pandemic-era games. Instead, the
11,500 athletes competing this year will be subject to routine Covid-19 testing
and strict social distancing guidelines while there. Of the more than 80 million Covid vaccinations given in the UK as of Thursday, 45,697,875 were first doses - a rise of 96,430 on the previous day. Meanwhile, 34,374,246 were second doses, an increase of 175,467. Jerome Wirawan and Liza TambunanBBC Indonesia Health workers in Indonesia are set to receive a third dose of the Moderna Covid-19 vaccine, in a government bid to boost their immunity against new variants of the virus. Moderna doses will arrive in the country on Sunday, with plans to begin vaccinations as soon as next week, Health Minister Budi Sadikin said. Between January and 9 July, 210 doctors died with Covid, according to the Indonesian Doctors Association. Twenty of them had been vaccinated using Sinovac, raising concerns over the efficacy of the Chinese-developed vaccine. Indonesia is currently experiencing a surge of cases linked to the highly infectious Delta variant. The government has put in place emergency restrictions on the islands of Java and Bali to drive down the infection rate, which has continued to break records in recent days. On Thursday, the country recorded more than 38,000 new cases, bringing the official tally to more than 2.4 million cases. More than 63.700 deaths have been recorded so far. The UK recorded another 35,707 new Covid-19 infections on Friday, the highest number of daily cases since 22 January. The government's coronavirus dashboard,externalalso recorded a further 29 deaths within 28 days of a positive test bringing the total so far to 128,365. A 16-year old receives a dose of the Pfizer vaccine The US state of Tennessee has halted vaccine outreach efforts to adolescents and teenagers after pressure
from conservative lawmakers, according toThe Tennessean,external. The state's top health official told colleagues last
week they should no longer advertise vaccine sites to anyone beyond the ""general population"" and should halt pop-up events for adolescents, the
newspaper said. The move comes two weeks after Republican state
lawmakers criticised health officials for recommending the Covid-19 jabs to
minors. In May, the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine was authorised in the US for
adolescents as young as 12. US vaccination rates have slowed in recent weeks, in
part due to lower turnout in southern states. Less than half of
Tennesseeâs residents aged 18 and older have been fully vaccinated - trailing
behind states like Vermont where more than 76% have been fully vaccinated. About 67% of American adults have received at least one shot. Malta is to ban all visitors from Wednesday unless they are fully vaccinated against Covid-19, the health minister has announced. ""We will be the first EU country to do so, but we need to
protect our society,"" Chris Fearne told a news conference, as the country reports a surge in cases. Malta is among a handful of countries on the UK's travel green list, meaning travellers returning from these countries to England do not need to quarantine. All UK passengers have had to present proof of full vaccination since 30 June, according toForeign Office travel advice,external. The restrictions have had a huge impact on the travel industry A group of top holiday firms including Ryanair, BA, tour operator Tui and Manchester Airports Group have launchedlegal action against the UK government over its Covid travel restrictions. They want more transparency over how the government takes decisions on its travel rules, including how it assesses the Covid threat in destination countries. The legal action is going ahead despite an easing of travel rules that will allow, from 19 July,fully vaccinated UK residents to return to England from an amber-list country without having to quarantine. Their case, which is against Transport Secretary Grant Shapps, was heard at London's High Court on Friday. Thetraffic light systemrates countries green, amber or red based on their Covid risk. Red-list countries have the strictest rules, with only UK or Irish nationals, or UK residents, allowed to return - and they must pay for a 10-day stay in a government quarantine hotel. There are still just a handful of ""green"" destinations, which tend to be smaller islands, for example, Malta. Major holiday destinations, such as Spain, Greece, France and the US, remain amber. The Department for Transport spokesperson said its traffic light system was intended to manage the risk of new variants, and added that the department could not comment on legal proceedings. It will be invitation only at the Copa America final at Rio's MaracanÃ£ stadium Yes, there's another final happening. Brazil and Argentina will decide the Copa America at Rio's MaracanÃ£ stadium on Saturday, and it will be invitation only. The city's mayor said only 6,500 spectators - 10% of the famous stadium's capacity - invited by the South American football federation, Conmebol, will allowed in. Everyone attending the event in the Brazilian city will be required to present a negative Covid-19 test before entering. For tomorrow's final, attendees will be spread throughout the entire stadium, instead of concentrated in one section, the mayor's office confirmed. The Brazilian government has drawn widespread criticism among public health experts and the public for hosting the Copa America, even as the country has yet to get the coronavirus pandemic under control. Some 140 people associated with the tournament had tested positive for the virus by late June, said Reuters. Hywel GriffithBBC Wales correspondent The Welsh government has announced that the use of face coverings will no longer be required in classrooms in Wales from September, and entire contact groups or so-called bubbles will no longer have to self-isolate as the result of a positive test in the next academic year. Schools, colleges and universities will take a track-and-trace approach instead, following the announcement last month that institutions would be allowed to choose their own rules - though teaching unions said this would be confusing. Education Minister Jeremy Miles has written to headteachers and principals to issue new guidance, saying that many young people had told him the current system was not proportionate. The new guidance, which comes into force on 1 September, says social distancing should be maintained where possible in secondary schools, including staff keeping two metres from each other. We have more on the guidance here. The lights at Le Duplex nightclub - next to the Champs Elysees avenue in Paris - are switched on as clubs prepare to reopen In France,nightclubs will be allowed to reopen on Fridayfor the first time in nearly 18 months as coronavirus restrictions meant they had to remain shut. Venues' capacity will be capped at 75% of normal, masks are recommended but not mandatory and clubbers will need to show proof of vaccination or a recent negative Covid test to gain entry, the AFP news agency reports. But not all clubs will be opening their doors as the Delta Covid variant continues to spread. It's believed only around a quarter of clubs will actually reopen - and only then with reduced capacity. The trade body that represents the industry says around 400 nightclubs have been forced to close permanently or are in deep financial trouble. Health Minister Olivier Veran was quoted by AFP as saying: ""We'll remain very vigilant, and obviously if we have to reverse course because things are going badly, we'll do what we have to."" He added that Delta infections now account for nearly 50% of the total new cases, and ""will soon account for the majority, probably this weekend."" Stendhal music festival will be held for the first time since 2019 The first music festival to be held in Northern Ireland since the start of the pandemic is under way. Stendhal Festival - based in Limavady, County Londonderry - iswelcoming back fewer numbersthan previous years. The festival, established in 2011, attracted a 10,000-strong crowd in 2019 - but this year about 2,500 visitors are expected. It follows Stormont's announcement thatlive music in Northern Ireland could resume from 5 July, as part of further relaxations to Covid-19 rules. While music performed indoors is restricted to an ""ambient sound level"" with screens placed in front of musicians, no volume restrictions apply to live music at outdoor events. Celia HattonBBC Asia Pacific regional editor North Korea has reportedly rejected donations of the AstraZeneca Covid-19 vaccine due to concerns over potential side effects, according to a South Korean think tank. The country has yet to confirm a single case of Covid-19, a claim long-questioned by analysts. Last week, its leader, Kim Jong-un,punished several officials after referring to an unspecified Covid-related incident, according to a North Korean state media report. But still, North Korea appears to be in no rush to procure vaccines. The Institute for National Security Strategy (INSS) in Seoul, which is linked to South Korea's spy agency, said Pyongyang had rejected donations of AstraZeneca on fears of its potential side effects. The Covax global vaccine distribution scheme allocated almost two million AstraZeneca shots to North Korea in February, but the shipments were delayed following extended consultations. The INSS said the country also refused Chinese vaccines in the belief they are not effective. The North Korean leadership reportedly favours Russian vaccines. The PM was photographed in his car leaving the Euro 2020 semi-final without his mask on Downing Street has defended Boris Johnson after he was seen leaving England's Euro 2020 semi-final in his official car without wearing a face covering A No 10 spokesman confirmed that ministers are supposed to wear masks while travelling in their government cars. However, the spokesman insisted the prime minister had put his mask on ""shortly after"" he got in the vehicle. Johnson had been at Wembley with his wife, Carrie, to cheer on England in their 2-1 victory over Denmark on Wednesday evening. Photographs of their departure in the PM's ministerial Range Rover inThe Mirror,externalshowed that while his wife, his driver and his security detail were all masked, Johnson's face was uncovered. The spokesman says: ""He was getting into the car and, in line with the guidance, put his mask on very shortly afterwards."" Olympic teams have been travelling to Tokyo ahead of the Games With the Tokyo Olympics and Paralympics fast approaching, the Japanese authorities have decided to declare a state of emergency in Tokyo. The Olympics begin on 23 July while the Paralympics start on 24 August, but events in the capital will take placewithout any spectators. So, what is the situation with infections in Japan, and how many people have been vaccinated? Our Reality Check team has answered those questions and others. The coronavirus reproduction number, or R value, in England has increased slightly to between 1.2 and 1.5, according to the latest government figures. This is up from last week, when it was 1.1 to 1.3. The R value represents the average number of people each person with Covid-19 goes on to infect. When the figure is above 1, an outbreak can grow exponentially. When it's below 1, it means the epidemic is shrinking. An R number between 1.2 and 1.5 means, on average, every 10 people infected will infect between 12 and 15 other people. The growth rate is 3% to 7%, which means the number of new infections is growing by 3% to 7% every day. Â© 2025 BBC.

The government confirmed large events like festivals could run after restrictions ease on 19 July Last year, the coronavirus pandemic wiped out theUK's summer festival season.Only a handful of shows were able to take place, and most of them were in car parks or socially-distanced green field sites. But the Reading Festival has now come one step closer to going ahead this summerafter the local council granted its event licence. It comes after the government confirmed Covid restrictions would end on 19 July, meaning large events like festivals could run. Reading Borough Council said there would need to be ""detailed consideration"" on how to minimise the risk of coronavirus. The festival - which was cancelled last year due to the pandemic - is expected to take place from 27 to 29 August this year. The line-up for this year's event is set to include Stormzy, Catfish & The Bottlemen, Post Malone, Disclosure, Liam Gallagher and Queens of the Stone Age. James GallagherHealth and science correspondent, BBC News Heart inflammation has been found to be a ""very rare"" side-effect of the coronavirus vaccinesmade by Pfizer and Moderna, according to the European Medicines Agency. Europe's watchdog said the side-effects were more common in younger men. It added that the benefits of Covid-19 vaccines continue to far outweigh any risks but advised doctors and patients to be aware of the symptoms of heart inflammation. These include chest pain, a feeling of breathlessness and a pounding or fluttering heartbeat. Anyone with these symptoms should see a doctor. Two conditions were linked to the vaccines - inflammation of the heart muscle itself, known as myocarditis, and inflammation of the fluid-filled sac the heart sits in, known as pericarditis. Five people died. The review said they were all either elderly or had other health conditions. The UK's Medicines and Healthcare products Regulatory Agency (MHRA) has also been investigating the link. Myocarditis and pericarditis will be officially listed as side-effects in the UK and Europe, mirroring a move by the regulators in the US last month.

UK Brexit minister to face Stormont committee,"Lord Frost is appearing in person before the committee The UK's Brexit minister has described negotiations with the EU overthe Northern Ireland Protocolas ""a little tense"" at the moment. Lord Frost appeared in person at Stormont's Executive Office committee on Friday. He said the UK and EU needed to find a ""new balance"" to ensure problems with the protocol's implementation were resolved. But he said elements of the protocol were also currently ""working well"". Lord Frost's evidence to the committee came just a week after the EU's chief negotiator gave evidence to the committee. Appearing before the committee, Lord Frost repeated thatthe government is preparing to publish its plans for the future of the protocol in the next fortnight, before Parliament rises for the summer recess. He said the EU had still not responded to 12 papers tabled by the UK. As it happened: Lord Frost briefs MLAs The EU has said a temporary Swiss-style veterinary agreement for Northern Ireland, in which the UK continues to follow EU agri-food rules, could be a solution, but it has been rejected by the UK. Lord Frost accused the EU of being unreasonable in responding to some of the UK's concerns. ""Their solution is 'why don't you adopt our rules, then there won't be a problem'. We're accused of being ideological but it seems to me, equally ideological to say 'why don't you just adopt our laws?'"" He said there were possible resolutions but that ""getting politics in the right place seems to be difficult"". Lord Frost's appearance at the committee comes just over a week after EU chief negotiator Maros Sefcovic addressed a Stormont committee ""It is a little tense at the moment. Nobody wants that but the protocol issues are at the core. ""There is a big prize if we can get this right, it does need both sides to take the situation seriously and fix the problems that currently exist,"" he added. The protocol is the part of the Brexit deal which keeps Northern Ireland in the EU single market for goods and means EU customs rules are enforced at its ports. It was agreed by the UK and EU in October 2019 and was subject to further negotiation and agreement in 2020. Lord Frost helped to negotiate the protocol on behalf of the UK government, but previously said it was not being implemented as he intended. Under the terms of the Brexit withdrawal treaty, the protocol can only be removed by a majority vote of the Stormont Assembly, with a vote due in 2024. EU 'confident' about chilled meat ban solution EU postpones ban on British meat sales in NI GB-NI grace period extension 'problematic' - Irish PM Committee chairman, the SDLP's Colin McGrath, said the government needed to ""own your deal"" and work to develop pragmatic solutions. Sinn FÃ©in's Pat Sheehan put it to Lord Frost that political problems with the protocol were being ""completely overblown"" and that a majority of businesses in Northern Ireland were supportive of the protocol. The minister replied that GB-NI trade opportunities had changed and in some cases, disappeared, and that was not what the government had ""wanted to achieve"" when delivering Brexit. ""Nobody that I've spoken to from a wide range of political and civil society, businesses, nobody thinks it's working perfectly as it should, or have suggested improvements,"" he added. Earlier on Friday, Lord Frost had met business representatives from Newry Chamber of Commerce and Trade, and other business leaders. Lord Frost (centre) meets business leaders in Newry on Friday Former DUP Economy Minister Diane Dodds said the government needed to recognise that the protocol had no support from any unionist parties at Stormont. ""You and the EU have overridden consent and now want majority rule. What are you going to do to restore the balance of consent?,"" she asked. Lord Frost said he had ""a good deal of sympathy"" for that argument. ""The consent mechanism is an albeit imperfect way of allowing the institutions here to say, looking at all these variances it's working tolerably, or looking at them all, it's not working,"" he added. ""If you don't have a fairly broad consent at most points, this is not simply something about in four years' time - you need to have broad consent to make it workable and that's why it worries us so much that we don't have it. Ulster Unionist vice-chair of the committee, John Stewart asked Lord Frost to explain what any ""rebalancing"" of the protocol would look like. Lord Frost said he would not reveal the details prior to a statement being made in Parliament, but added that the ""fundamental issue"" was finding a way to ensure goods could move from GB to NI in a ""freer way than possible"" at present.

Breaking|Breaking newsHospitality gives UK economy a boost in MayEconomic output grows 0.8% in May helped by pubs and restaurants serving customers indoors.Business,"The UK's economy grew more slowly than expected in May after a rebound in the hospitality sector was offset by disruptions to car production. The economy expanded by 0.8% in May as coronavirus restrictions eased to allow pubs and restaurants to serve indoors. While that was the fourth consecutive month of growth, it was also a slowdown from the 2% growth seen in April. The economy is still 3.1% below pre-pandemic levels,the Office for National Statistics said,external. ""Of course, the pace of the recovery was always going to slow as the economy climbed back towards its pre-crisis level. But we hadn't expected it to slow so much so soon,"" said Paul Dales, an economist with Capital Economics. What is GDP and how does it affect me? Will England's success boost the UK economy? House prices set to continue rising as supply shrinks Pubs and restaurants ""were responsible for the vast majority of the growth seen in May"", said Jonathan Athow, ONS deputy national statistician for economic statistics ""Hotels also saw a marked recovery as restrictions lifted,"" he added. Accommodation and food services grew by a massive 37.1% in May, with the overall services sector growing 0.9%. But UK carmakers struggled with a shortage of microchips, with the manufacture of transport equipment falling by 16.5%. Construction firms were hit by very wet weather in May as firms lost working days, although the ONS said the sector remained 0.3% above February 2020's pre-pandemic level. British Chambers of Commerce head of economics Suren Thiru said: ""While the latest figures confirm the rebound in economic activity continued into May, the sharp slowdown in growth suggests that the recovery is losing a little steam as the temporary boost, from the earlier phases of reopening, fades."" Overall, in the three months to May, economic output rose by 3.6%, helped by strong retail sales, and as pubs, restaurants and schools reopened from March. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""The government is continuing to support the recovery, with the furlough scheme in place until September, and schemes like Restart helping people who have sadly lost their jobs get back into work."" Looking ahead, Emma-Lou Montgomery, associate director at Fidelity International, said: ""A sporting summer may not directly cause an 'it's coming home' bounce, but the impact on consumer confidence can't be ignored. ""That being said, there are many unknowns ahead. The UK is set on its roadmap to 'freedom day' but cases are rising, challenges in the labour market persist and the initial spending boom could slow in pace."" After shrinking at the start of the year under renewed lockdowns, the economy is meant to be surging back. On a chart, a line graph looks like the second bounce of a precipitous economic bungee jump. In that light, today's figures are a disappointment. The consensus forecast was for growth of 1.5% in May. Instead we got barely half that - 0.8% - with activity in construction shrinking for the second month in a row and manufacturing also down. Some of that was down to one-off factors such as the shortage of microchips, which forced carmakers to send workers home. But while activity in restaurants and pubs jumped as customers were allowed inside for the first time in months, it's clear that our economic bungee cord is slackening before it was expected. The economy remains 3.1% below where it was in February last year, and no larger than it was in January 2017, making it one of the two weakest performers in the G20 group of advanced economies. In the UK, new GDP figures are produced every month, but the quarterly figures - covering three months at a time - are the most widely watched. In a growing economy, quarterly GDP will be slightly bigger than the quarter before, a sign that people are doing more work and getting (on average) a little bit richer. Most economists, politicians and businesses like to see GDP rising steadily. Rising GDP means more jobs are likely to be created, and workers are more likely to get better pay rises. If GDP is falling, then the economy is shrinking - bad news for businesses and workers. If GDP falls for two quarters in a row, that is known as a recession, which can mean pay freezes and lost jobs. Read more here. Aseparate statement,externalfrom the Office for National Statistics on trade figures showed that the UK is still importing more goods from outside the EU than from the bloc following Brexit. However, the difference is narrowing. The value of imports from non-EU countries were Â£20bn in May, while imports from the bloc - many of which face new barriers to cross-border trade - were Â£18.4bn, the ONS said. The value of goods exported to non-EU countries - Â£13.7bn - was also higher than to EU countries, at Â£12.9bn. How fast is the UK's economy growing?

"Police chief apologises for bomb response failingsDeputy Chief Constable Ian Pilling says the response to the Manchester Arena attack was ""unacceptable"".Manchester","Deputy Chief Constable Ian Pilling has apologised to families of the 22 people who died A police chief has apologised ""unreservedly"" for failings by his force in the emergency service response to the Manchester Arena bombing. Deputy Chief Constable Ian Pilling said Greater Manchester Police's failure to establish effective inter-service communications was ""unacceptable"". He was giving evidence at the public inquiry into the May 2017 attack which killed 22 people and injured hundreds. Mr Pilling also praised the actions of the ""brave"" first responders. ""I would like to offer condolences from Greater Manchester Police (GMP) to all those who lost loved ones, who suffered injuries or hurt, or have been affected in any way by the tragic events at the Manchester Arena in 2017,"" he said. ""The response of so many of our staff, particularly first responders on the night, was exemplary, extraordinarily brave and quite humbling. ""However, I would like to acknowledge and apologise for failings by Greater Manchester Police, principally failing to carry out the basic functions of Jesip (Joint Emergency Services Interoperability Principles) in the early stages of the incident which impacted considerably on joint working."" Mr Pilling said a failure to notify other emergency services of the declaration of Operation Plato - a pre-planned response to a terror incident - and a failure to establish effective communications with other emergency services was ""unacceptable and we apologise for this unreservedly"". ""This is an apology not just to the victims and the families but also to all those affected by the attack including our emergency services colleagues,"" he said. He said ""significant work"" had been undertaken to address many of the issues and added: ""I would like to give absolute assurance our efforts to address these failings and any others which are identified will continue in the future."" Twenty-two people were killed in the May 2017 bombing The inquiry has heard the other blue light emergency services were unable to get through to the phone line of GMP's force duty officer (FDO), the initial commander of the incident. Only three paramedics entered the City Room foyer - the scene of the blast at the end of an Ariana Grande concert - and the fire service attended more than two hours later. Nick de la Poer QC, counsel to the inquiry, asked Mr Pilling: ""From what you have seen of the evidence, was there sufficient resilience around the FDO on the night of 22 May?"" Mr Pilling replied: ""I believe if certain things had been in place or if actions had been allocated in a certain way by the FDO then in terms of the number of people, the resilience around him, I believe yes there was."" The officer agreed there was insufficient effort put in up to the first 90 minutes after the explosion to ensure all emergency service partners met at a rendezvous point. He accepted GMP must share a responsibility for that failure as it was the primary partner in the terrorist response and was expected to take the lead. Geoff Harris said on the night of the attack, there was a failure of leadership within the fire service A senior fire chief has also apologised for a ""gross failure"" in the Greater Manchester Fire and Rescue Service (GMFRS) response to the attack. Retired assistant chief fire officer Geoff Harris, who was effectively second in command on the night, said the response was ""completely unacceptable"". ""It was far from adequate or effective,"" he told the inquiry. ""I extend my personal apologies for the failure of the fire and rescue service to respond adequately on that night. ""I don't think there's any one single point of failure. There are a number of issues that arose."" Fire manager angry at arena bomb response Arena police chief probed over inquiry evidence Fire service bomb response was a 'catastrophe' Mr Harris, who had more than 35 years of service before retiring, said some of his officers were ""stuck in a loop"" of trying to contact the police and displayed ""some inertia"" in overcoming the communication problems. Paul Greaney QC, lead counsel to the inquiry, asked if the delay represented ""not just a failure but a gross failure in response"". Mr Harris replied: ""It does, sir."" He agreed that on the night there had been a failure of leadership within GMFRS and that it was ""too risk averse"" in its response. A few hours after the bombing, Mr Harris met firefighters who were ""fuming"" about the failed response. He recalled there was a ""ring of firefighters around me"" demanding answers which he was unable to give. ""Not only did we let down the people of Greater Manchester, we let those firefighters down,"" he said. The inquiry continues.

"Pandemic leaves councils with Â£3bn black holeBus services, children's centres and care services for disabled and elderly people are at risk in some areas.UK","UK councils face a Â£3bn black hole in their budgets as they emerge from the pandemic, a BBC investigation into their finances can reveal. Some local authorities were struggling to carry out statutory duties and were at risk of bankruptcy, a local government expert said. And 10 councils have asked to borrow Â£300m of emergency money from the government to plug financial holes. The government says it has handed councils Â£12bn during the pandemic. A spokesman for the Ministry of Housing, Communities and Local Government (MHCLG) said: ""In the coming months, we will take stock of the demands faced by councils and the resources available to meet them and will decide on the timetable for future fundingâ¯reform."" The spokesman claimed there were a small number of councils that were ""in severe financial distress such as Croydon and Slough due to poor leadership and chronic financial mismanagement, long predating the pandemic. ""These councils have badly let down their residents."" Analysing 170 upper-tier and single tier councils in the UK the BBC Shared Data Unit found: UK local authorities plan to make at least Â£1.7bn worth of savings in the 2021-22 financial year while also using more than Â£500m worth of reserves to balance the books A quarter of those savings - some Â£434m - will be made in adult social care departments, which provide support to the elderly and vulnerable Despite making the cuts, local authorities predict a Â£3bn shortfall in their budgets by 2023-24 Nearly 60% of councils in England have risen council tax by the new statutory maximum of 4.99% to compensate for losses, a rise of about Â£100 on a yearly Band D bill in many areas Savings will see the threshold for which disabled or elderly individuals can receive care raised, bus services scrapped and children's centres closed in parts of the UK. Fees and charges for parking, planning and crematoria are set to rises in places. In the London borough of Bexley, 264 staff posts will be deleted, while library opening hours and road repairs will be reduced. Sharon Taylor, a Labour councillor who chairs the Local Government Association's resources board, said the pandemic had highlighted an existing funding crisis brought about by a reduction in central government grants - a fall of up to 70% over ten years in some places. She said ""Cuts to local government hurt people and they hurt the everyday services people see when they walk outside their door."" Council budgets have been stretched for some time, but for many the pandemic has exacerbated the problem. It's increased the amount local authorities have had to spend on supporting their communities, and at the same time hit income streams hard. This new BBC analysis lays bare the scale of the challenge facing councils across the UK, and spells out some of the cuts to services planned for this year - as well further shortfalls predicted. Westminster and the devolved governments have provided extra money, which has been welcomed by local authorities. But what many in the sector really want is a new, more sustainable way of funding councils and the services they provide - not least social care. The government has promised reform; for local authorities it can't come too soon. Since the start of the pandemic, councils have been asked to provide extra services, such as home food deliveries for those shielding, finding accommodation for street sleepers and, in some cases, helping with the test and trace initiative. They have also had to supply workers with Personal Protective Equipment (PPE). But, at the same time they have seen income from things such as town centre parking, council tax and business rates plummet. In many cases, councils have also lost revenue from private investments. Authorities in Luton, Manchester and the West Midlands part-own airports, where passenger flights have been largely grounded during the pandemic. Croydon Council, which borrowed Â£545m to make a series of investments including a shopping centre and a hotel, saw the latter go into administration in June 2020. The authority effectively declared itself bankrupt in November 2020. Between 2016 and 2020, councils invested more than Â£7.6bn into commercial properties, a third of which were retail properties, according to the National Audit Office. Ms Taylor said the government had encouraged councils to invest in commercial property to raise funds. She said: ""[It] seems to have a very ambiguous attitude towards that now, and is saying those investments were down to us and if we've lost income they are not going to make up for those losses."" Chair of the public accounts committee Dame Meg Hillier MP said some councils had made ""risky choices"" at the expense of the taxpayer. But she also said the committee was generally critical of the MHCLG policy and its ""lack of understanding about councils' exposure to risk"". Last week, Slough Council issued a Section 114 notice, becoming the third council in four years to effectively declare itself bankrupt. The authority was one of 9 in England to have applied for a capitalisation direction, an emergency measure allowing a council to either borrow money to cover losses or to move funds from its building programme to fund day-to-day expenses. Around Â£290m is to be issued to councils, all of which will have to be repaid over a period of time. Croydon Council asked for the most support from the scheme - worth Â£120m over the next two years. Nottingham City Council, which placed its power company, Robin Hood Energy, into administration in January,  is set to borrow Â£35m. Other councils seeking financial support are Wirral, Peterborough, Bexley, Eastbourne, Luton and Copeland. Redcar and Cleveland said it had sought a government grant following a ransomware attack by hackers which affected its computer network. In Croydon, residents said they were feeling the effects of council cuts. Earlier this year, the residents of Regina Road said they had so much black mould in their council-owned properties it was a risk to their health. Others said they went days without electricity, or burst pipes that spilled sewage into living spaces. Months before, in November, the council had issued a section 114 notice, limiting itself to only essential spending, as it seeks to make Â£45m of cuts. Croydon residents have complained at the state of the ground-keeping Some residents were not able to find graves at a cemetery as the reduction to grounds maintenance had allowed the grass to grow over the headstones, according to the Local Democracy Reporting Service. Elizabeth Ash, a Croydon resident of 25 years and part of a campaign to stop the council closing five libraries, said the state of services was causing some people to consider moving out of the south London borough. ""The graffiti services have all but stopped now,"" she said. ""There's been a proliferation of tagging on people's properties. All of these things have a knock-on effect in the community."" ""We don't have money to waste but it keeps getting wasted. The residents have to live with the fallout from it."" Councillor Hamida Ali, leader of the council, said she was ""serious about tackling (the) financial situation, improving how Croydon is run and providing good value services for residents"". Prof Arianna Giovannini said the pandemic had created a ""postcode lottery"" in council services Arianna Giovannini is deputy director of the Local Governance Research Centre (LGRC) based at De Montfort University. She said the pandemic had ""deepened regional inequalities"" - particularly in England - by pushing financially burdened councils into further difficulty. She said: ""The pandemic has forced councils to think the unthinkable.  We are in a position where some councils are struggling to continue to deliver just the statutory services."" An MHCLG spokesperson said: ""We've given councils over Â£8.9bn in response to specific pressures from the pandemic - that's over Â£2bn more than they told us in the detailed reporting they have provided that they spent last year to tackle Covid-19. We have already provided Â£3bn in additional funding for this year."" The Welsh government said it had provided councils with Â£1.4bn to ensure services did not bear the brunt of the financial impact of the pandemic. The Scottish government said its support package totalled more than Â£1.5bn. A spokesman said: ""However, our ability to go further in supporting the recovery is limited and our calls to the UK Government for additional fiscal powers have so far gone unheeded."" The Northern Ireland Executive said it had provided an additional Â£85m of funding to councils, adding that it considered the financial situation of local authorities to be ""generally satisfactory"".

Foreign hit squad killed Haiti president say police,"This video can not be played Haiti parades suspects after president's murder A group of 28 foreign mercenaries, including retired Colombian soldiers, assassinated Haiti's President Jovenel MoÃ¯se earlier this week, police say. After a gun battle in the capital Port-au-Prince, 17 were detained, some at the house they were using, others after entering Taiwan's diplomatic compound. Three suspects were killed by police and eight are still being sought. Bloodied and bruised, arrested suspects were shown to the media on Thursday, along with a slew of seized weapons. It is still unclear who organised the attack and with what motive. Also unclear is who is in charge of the country. On Friday, a group of political parties added to that uncertainty by nominating a president, although how much legitimacy that has is unknown. The attack took place in the early hours of Wednesday, when gunmen broke into the president's home in Port-au-Prince, shooting him dead and wounding his wife. Mr MoÃ¯se, 53, was found lying on his back with 12 bullet wounds and a gouged eye, according to authorities. Martine MoÃ¯se, 47, was seriously wounded and is in a stable condition after being flown to Florida for treatment. Police said the hit squad included mainly Colombians, along with two Haitian-Americans. Found in the suspects' possession were firearms, sets of US dollar bills, the president's personal chequebook and the server that held surveillance camera footage from his home, Le Nouvelliste newspaper reported. Taiwan confirmed that 11 of the suspects were arrested after breaking into a courtyard at its compound. What we know about the killing so far Angry civilians had joined the search for the gunmen, and helped police track down some who were hiding in bushes. The crowd set fire to three of the suspects' cars and destroyed evidence. Axes, wire-cutters, sets of US dollar bills and Colombian passports have been seized Police chief LÃ©on Charles called for calm, saying the public should not take the law into their own hands. At the news conference on Thursday, police showed reporters Colombian passports. ""Foreigners came to our country to kill the president,"" Mr Charles said, as the suspects sat on the floor behind him in handcuffs. Colombia's government has pledged to assist Haiti with its investigation efforts. Colombian police director, Gen Jorge Luis Vargas, said 17 former Colombian soldiers were thought to be involved. The US state department, meanwhile, said it could not confirm if any of its citizens had been detained. However, US and Canadian media are reporting that one of the dual citizens arrested, James Solages, 35, is from Florida and was a former bodyguard at the Canadian embassy in Haiti. An investigating judge told local media that Mr Solages and the other US citizen, named as Joseph Vincent, had said they were there as translators for the mercenaries, after finding the job on the internet. ""The mission was to arrest President Jovenel MoÃ¯se... and not to kill him,"" Judge ClÃ©ment NoÃ«l told Le Nouvelliste. The US said on Friday it was sending FBI and Department of Homeland Security officials to Haiti following the nation's request for help in the investigation. Members of Mr MoÃ¯se's security detail have been summoned before Haiti's courts to answer questions about its failures. Large crowds surrounded the PÃ©tion-Ville Police station in Port-au-Prince where the men have been detained Colombian daily El Tiempo said that it had seen confidential documents that named the Colombian suspects. The paper's research suggests that four of them flew from Colombia to the Dominican Republic on 4 June. They crossed by land from there into Haiti two days later. The two countries share the island of Hispaniola. According to El Tiempo, Colombian intelligence has seen photos posted on social media by members of the group, showing them posing at a popular tourist spot in the Dominican Republic. The killing has triggered some civil unrest in Haiti, the poorest nation in the Americas. A state of emergency remains in force across the country, while the Dominican Republic has closed its border. The situation has been unclear and is getting murkier. In this particular situation, the constitution says the National Assembly should choose another president. But disputes meant that elections scheduled for October 2019 did not take place - and Mr MoÃ¯se had been ruling by decree amid widespread protests. Amendments to the constitution - not accepted by everyone - suggest the prime minister should be the next one to take over. But Haiti has both an interim prime minister, Claude Joseph, and a new appointee, Ariel Henry, who has yet to be sworn in. Both are claiming to be in charge. On Friday, a group of political parties signed a resolution proclaiming a new president - Joseph Lambert - with Mr Henry acting as his PM. The situation is doing little to resolve the political and economic instability that has long plagued the nation.  11 millioninhabitants 59%percentage who live below the poverty line 2004-2017years in which a UN peacekeeping force was present 200,000number of people killed in the 2010 earthquake US charges four over Haiti president assassination Haiti's president killed in attack at home Dispute over Haiti presidency triggers unrest Why are there so many protests in Haiti?

"Biden defends US withdrawal amid Taliban advance""The status quo was not an option,"" the fourth president to oversee the war said as violence flares.US & Canada","US President Joe Biden has defended his decision to withdraw military forces from Afghanistan, saying that US operations will end on 31 August. The fourth US president to oversee the war also defended the speed of the US withdrawal, saying it saved lives. Mr Biden's speech comes as the Taliban militant group continues to seize territory around the country. US forces have fought in Afghanistan for nearly 20 years, following the terror attacks of 11 September 2001. Earlier this year, Mr Biden set a 11 September 2021 goal of withdrawing all US troops. Donald Trump had agreed with the Taliban to pull out US troops by May 2021, but that deadline was pushed back by Mr Biden after he took office in January. This video can not be played Biden: 'We did not go to Afghanistan to nation build' ""Just one more year of fighting in Afghanistan is not a solution,"" Mr Biden said in a White House speech, ""but a recipe for fighting there indefinitely."" He also denied that a Taliban takeover is ""inevitable,"" saying that the Taliban force of approximately 75,000 fighters is no match for the 300,000 Afghan security forces. Even after the total pull out is complete, the US is expected to keep 650 to 1,000 troops in Afghanistan to guard the US embassy, Kabul airport, and other key government installations. Recent polls have shown broad US support for leaving Afghanistan, with Republican voters more sceptical of the decision to withdraw. Mr Biden also said that efforts are being made to get translators, interpreters and other Afghans that worked with the US government out of the country. He said 2,500 special immigrant visas have been issued to allow them to come to the United States, but only half have come so far. Senator Biden and Vice-President Biden believed the US should get out of Afghanistan. Now President Biden is Commander-in-Chief. He was at pains to say support for Afghanistan wouldn't stop, but even more adamant that both Afghan politicians and security forces had the capacity to prevent a Taliban takeover. ""Will they do it?"" he asked. That's what Afghans have asked - repeatedly - in the midst of continuing disarray and disunity in Kabul, and the dramatic Taliban advance in the districts. The president's emphasis on speaking out for women and girls isn't heard in districts already under Taliban control where they're not going to school. As a president who's known to study all the scenarios, he made it clear ""it's highly unlikely"" there will be a unified government, and not much the US could do, or should do, if Kabul collapses. That's up to Afghans - and the countries next door. Last month, Mr Biden assured Afghan leaders at a White House meeting that US aid will continue. Most British troops have left Afghanistan - PM The vast majority of remaining foreign forces in Afghanistan have left ahead of the US 11 September deadline, leaving the Afghan military completely in charge of national security. President Ashraf Ghani insists that Afghan security forces are fully capable of keeping insurgents at bay, but there have been reports of thousands of Afghan troops seeking refuge in other countries to avoid the fighting. Earlier in the week,Taliban spokesman Suhail Shaheen told the BBC that the group was not responsible for the recent increase in violence.  He insisted that many districts had fallen to the Taliban through mediation after Afghan soldiers refused to fight. US-led forces ousted the Taliban from power in Afghanistan in 2001. The group had been harbouring Osama Bin Laden and other al-Qaeda figures linked to the 9/11 attacks in the US that triggered the invasion. However, it has gradually been regaining territory in recent years. From 9/11, to intense fighting on the ground, and now full withdrawal of US-led forces, hereâs what happened. 11 September 2001 Al-Qaeda, led by Osama Bin Laden in Afghanistan, carries out the largest terror attack ever conducted on US soil. Four commercial airliners are hijacked. Two are flown into the World Trade Centre in New York, which collapses. One hits the Pentagon building in Washington, and one crashes into a field in Pennsylvania. Nearly 3,000 people are killed. 7 October 2001 A US-led coalition bombs Taliban and al-Qaeda facilities in Afghanistan. Targets include Kabul, Kandahar and Jalalabad. The Taliban, who took power after a decade-long Soviet occupation was followed by civil war, refuse to hand over Bin Laden. Their air defences and small fleet of fighter aircraft are destroyed. 13 November 2001 The Northern Alliance, a group of anti-Taliban rebels backed by coalition forces, enters Kabul as the Taliban flee the city. By the 13 November 2001, all Taliban have either fled or been neutralised. Other cities quickly fall. 26 January 2004 After protracted negotiations at a “loya jirga” or grand assembly, the new Afghan constitution is signed into law. The constitution paves the way for presidential elections in October 2004. 7 December 2004 Hamid Karzai, the leader of the Popalzai Durrani tribe, becomes the first president under the new constitution. He serves two five-year terms as president. May 2006 British troops arrive in Helmand province, a Taliban stronghold in the south of the country. Their initial mission is to support reconstruction projects, but they are quickly drawn into combat operations. More than 450 British troops lose their lives in Afghanistan over the course of the conflict. 17 February 2009 US President Barack Obama approves a major increase in the number of troops sent to Afghanistan. At their peak, they number about 140,000. The so-called “surge” is modelled on US strategy in Iraq where US forces focussed on protecting the civilian population as well as killing insurgent fighters. 2 May 2011 The leader of al-Qaeda is killed in an assault by US Navy Seals on a compound in Abbottabad in Pakistan. Bin Ladenâs body is removed and buried at sea. The operation ends a 10-year hunt led by the CIA. Â The confirmation that Bin Laden had been living on Pakistani soil fuels accusations in the US that Pakistan is an unreliable ally in the war on terror. 23 April 2013 The founder of the Taliban, Mullah Mohammed Omar, dies. His death is kept secret for more than two years. According to Afghan intelligence, Mullah Omar dies of health problems at a hospital in the Pakistani city of Karachi. Pakistan denies that he was in the country. 28 December 2014 At a ceremony in Kabul, Nato ends its combat operations in Afghanistan. With the surge now over, the US withdraws thousands of troops. Â Most of those who remain focus on training and supporting the Afghan security forces. 2015 The Taliban launch a series of suicide attacks, car bombings and other assaults. The parliament building in Kabul, and the city of Kunduz are attacked. Islamic State militants begin operations in Afghanistan. 25 January 2019 Afghan President Ashraf Ghani says more than 45,000 members of his countryâs security forces have been killed since he became leader in 2014. The figure is far higher than previously thought. 29 February 2020 The US and the Taliban sign an “agreement for bringing peace” to Afghanistan, in Doha, Qatar. The US and Nato allies agree to withdraw all troops within 14 months if the militants uphold the deal. 13 April 2021 US president Joe Biden announces that all US troops will leave Afghanistan by 11 September 2021. 16 August 2021 In just over a month, the Taliban sweep across Afghanistan, taking control of towns and cities all over the country, including Kabul. Afghan security forces collapse in the face of the Taliban advance. Who are the Taliban?

NHS Covid app sensitivity to be reviewed,"This video can not be played Grant Shapps: 'As our restrictions change, the NHS app needs to change in line' The NHS Covid contact tracing app used in England and Wales may need to change as coronavirus restrictions change, Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said. England ending the 1m-plus rule on 19 July may mean the app's sensitivity needs to be reduced, he said. The app detects the distance between users and the length of time spent in close proximity - currently 2m or less and more than 15 minutes. It comes amid a huge rise in alerts as infections surge. The system allows people who test positive to anonymously share their test result, triggering alerts for those detected as close contacts in the days before the test. Under current rules, those who receive an alert are asked to stay at home for up to 10 days, although the Department of Health said the app ""is, and always has been, advisory"" - unlike the requirement to isolate if you are contacted directly by NHS Test and Trace. Coronavirus restrictions are set to end on 19 July butthe requirement to self-isolate if you have had both vaccine doses will only stop on 16 August, raising fears thatmillions of people would be asked to self-isolate this summeras people mixed more. The hospitality industry and NHS trusts have warned MPs the knock-on effect for the economy and workplaces could be huge. What happens if I'm 'pinged' by the app? Amber list quarantine for fully vaccinated to end What are the travel rules if I've had both jabs? One possible solution could be to change the sensitivity of the app, so it would tell people to self-isolate only after closer and more prolonged contact. But sources at the app developers told the BBC they have not yet been asked to do this, although they are planning a change from 16 August when people would be able to record that they were fully vaccinated to turn off the self-isolation countdown timer. Mr Shapps told BBC Breakfast: ""As our restrictions change, of course the app needs to change. Things like replacing the 1m-plus rule on 19 July might well lead to a review of the way the app itself needs to function."" But he said the app was still ""very important as one of the tools in our armoury"". He said there were still large numbers of people downloading it and said he had not seen any data showing people were deleting it. The most recent figures for the last week of June show an extra 300,000 downloads, bringing the total to more than 26 million, but it is not known how many people are active users. ""It's in our interests as a society to carry on doing the things that protect each other,"" Mr Shapps said. Technically, it wouldn't be very difficult to tweak the app to make it less ""sensitive"" - the hard bit is working out exactly what those tweaks should be. Currently, two phones with the app installed, exchange a digital handshake, via bluetooth, every five minutes. It registers how far apart they are, and for how long. If one of those phones then goes on to report a positive Covid test, other phones who were two metres away or less, for a duration of 15 minutes during a 24 hour period, are likely to receive an isolation alert. As we have learned more about the virus, other factors have also been incorporated such as how infectious the person was likely to have been at the time the two phones were in close proximity. Changing those parameters would be straightforward. But fundamentally it's the volume of cases which are driving the volume of isolation alerts, not the app itself. In the last week of June there were 356,000 alerts, triggered by 61,000 positive test reports - that's about six app users isolating per Covid case. When you look at it like that, it doesn't sound so excessive. And because of the app's focus on privacy nobody, including the government, the police and the NHS knows who has been ""pinged"" - making it legally unenforceable. But Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he was concerned about the possible changes, saying weakening the app would undermine the track and trace system the government had spent billions on. He said: ""This feels like taking the batteries out of the smoke detector and that is never a good idea."" A Downing Street source stressed people were still being encouraged to self-isolate if they got an alert, adding the Department of Health's statement that the app was advisory was consistent with the government's message to ""act cautiously, especially as we know cases will rise"". Dr Jenny Harries, the head of the new UK Health Security Agency, told MPs on Thursday she was ""aware that people are choosing not to use the app"" when asked about concerns people have been deleting it to avoid being ""pinged"". Hinting at a change, she added there was ""work ongoing at the moment because it is entirely possible to tune the app to ensure that it is appropriate to the risk"". What are the holiday rules for Portugal, Malta and Spain? I'm fully jabbed, so do I have to self-isolate? How the England and Wales contact-tracing app works A source close to Health Secretary Sajid Javid told the BBC ""we are looking at the sensitivity of the app"" and pointed out the sensitivity had been changed before. But they did not say exactly what would change. At present, if two phones running the app are close for long enough, and one of the two users later shares a positive coronavirus test via the app, then the other will receive an alert. You can also use the app to ""check-in"" to venues so you can be notified of any positive cases you may have encountered there, although the requirement to check-in will be lifted in England when lockdown rules ease further on 19 July. A total of 496 venue alerts - which use the check-in data to alert people to potential contact with a positive case - were sent between 24 June and 30 June. But alerts for people coming into close contact with someone testing positive soared by more than 60% in the last week of June to 360,000. At the end of May, there were only 16,000 alerts in a week. A BBC analysis has estimated 4.5 million peoplecould be asked to self-isolatebetween this week and 16 August, as the number of infections continues to rise. The NHS Covid-19 app is used in England and Wales. Wales, Scotland and Northern Ireland have their own powers to set coronavirus regulations andseparate test-and-trace programmes. On Thursday, Chancellor Rishi Sunak acknowledged there was ""frustration"" at how theNHS contact tracing appcould continue to order the double jabbed to isolate. Prof Sir Jonathan Montgomery, a healthcare law expert from University College London who advised the government on the initial launch of the app, said it could still be useful but the government needed to issue new guidance. ""The real reason we shouldn't abandon the tool is because so many transmissions of Covid happen before people realise they are unwell,"" he told Times Radio. ""What the app does is enable you to be careful, and what the government needs to say is 'what does care look like in the new world?'."" LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? COVID IMMUNITY:Can you catch it twice? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries Meanwhile, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the country was ""moving to a system of testing rather than self-isolation"". ""I rely on the NHS app, as many people do,"" he said. ""I know how difficult it has been for people and I'm sorry for the hassle that people experienced as a result of this - it is coming to an end."" A further 32,551 new coronavirus cases were recorded on Thursday, alongside another 35 deaths within 28 days of a positive test.

How does NHS Test and Trace work?,"Self-isolation rules are changing in some parts of the UK for fully vaccinated adults and children under 18. If they are identified as a close contact of someone who's tested positive for Covid, they may soon be able to take a PCR test rather than self-isolate for 10 days. You mustself-isolate for 10 daysif you: test positive for Covid-19 live with someone who tests positive are approached by text, email or phone by contact tracers who identify you as a close contact of someone who has tested positive arrive in the UK from ared list country,external arrive in the UK from France arrive from any otheramber list country,externaland you are 18 or over, and have not been vaccinated You must also self-isolate if you or someone you live with hasCovid symptoms. You can stop self-isolating if the person with symptoms gets a negative PCR result. Each UK nation has its own contact-tracing service: England -NHS Test and Trace,external Scotland -Test and Protect,external Wales -Test, Trace, Protect,external Northern Ireland -Contact tracing service,external When peopletest positive,externalfor coronavirus, they are asked to provide details of their close contacts. These include: people they've spent at least 15 minutes with, at a distance of less than 2m (6ft) sexual partners, people they live with or have had face-to-face conversations with, at a distance of less than 1m (3ft) If you are deemed a close contact, other people in your household don't have to self-isolate unless you or they develop symptoms. Scotland From 9 August, fully vaccinated adults identified as close contacts of someone who tested positive for Covid will no longer have to self-isolate for 10 days. Instead, if they have no symptoms and at least two weeks have passed since the second dose, they can get a PCR test. If the result is negative, self-isolation can then be ended. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon announced a similar change - with a negative PCR result - for people aged 17 or under. Children under the age of five will be encouraged, but not required, to take a PCR test. England From 16 August,external, fully vaccinated adults and all under-18s contacted by NHS Test and Trace (not the app) will be advisedto take one PCR testas soon as possible. As long as that is negative, and they don't develop symptoms, they won't need to take further action. Wales Similar changes will happen in Walesfrom 7 August,external. However, people will be also advised to take PCR test on day two and day eight, whether they are fully vaccinated or not. Northern Ireland Ministers in Northern Ireland are expectedto discuss changes on 12 August. Any adult not fully vaccinated will still need to isolate if they are identified as contacts. Anyone who tests positive - regardless of age, vaccination status, or whether or not they have symptoms - will also still need to self-isolate. TheNHS Covid app,externalis available to download in England and Wales. If you have the app, and you spend enough time close to another person using it, you will receive a ""ping"" alert if they later test positive for Covid. You need to be within 2m (6ft) of them for 15 minutes to trigger the alert. Northern IrelandandScotlandhave separate apps. If you are ""pinged"" you're advised - but not legally obliged -to self-isolate for 10 days. Government ministers have said it is ""crucial""  that people self-isolate when sent an alert. However, it's feared that the large number of people being alerted has led tomany users deleting the app. Currently, when someone tested positive but had no symptoms, the NHS Covid app went back five days before the test, and alerted any close contacts during that time. However, the app will soon only alert close contactsfrom the previous two days before the positive test. The sensitivity of the app itself has not changed, and anyone testing positive will still have to self-isolate. In the week to 28 July, nearly 396,000 people in England and Wales received alerts from the app, a sharp drop from 690,000 the week before. In England, employers providing critical services can now request an exemption for named employees who are fully vaccinated.Sectors include energy and emergency services,external. Supermarket depot workers and food manufacturers are among those exempt from quarantine rules whatever their vaccination status. A similar system is being launched in Scotland. AÂ£500 grant is available,externalin England to people on low incomes who have to self-isolate. This includes parents who can't work because their child has to self-isolate. However, manyapplications have been turned down. In Scotland people can apply for theSelf-Isolation Support Grant,external, worth Â£500, and there isa similar scheme in Wales,external. In Northern Irelanda discretionary payment is available.,external You may also be entitled toStatutory Sick Pay,external, which is worth Â£96.35 a week, or more if your employer has a sick pay scheme.

"Foreign hit squad killed Haiti's president - policeA group of 26 Colombians and two Americans shot President Jovenel MoÃ¯se in his home, police say.Latin America & Caribbean","This video can not be played Haiti parades suspects after president's murder A group of 28 foreign mercenaries, including retired Colombian soldiers, assassinated Haiti's President Jovenel MoÃ¯se earlier this week, police say. After a gun battle in the capital Port-au-Prince, 17 were detained, some at the house they were using, others after entering Taiwan's diplomatic compound. Three suspects were killed by police and eight are still being sought. Bloodied and bruised, arrested suspects were shown to the media on Thursday, along with a slew of seized weapons. It is still unclear who organised the attack and with what motive. Also unclear is who is in charge of the country. On Friday, a group of political parties added to that uncertainty by nominating a president, although how much legitimacy that has is unknown. The attack took place in the early hours of Wednesday, when gunmen broke into the president's home in Port-au-Prince, shooting him dead and wounding his wife. Mr MoÃ¯se, 53, was found lying on his back with 12 bullet wounds and a gouged eye, according to authorities. Martine MoÃ¯se, 47, was seriously wounded and is in a stable condition after being flown to Florida for treatment. Police said the hit squad included mainly Colombians, along with two Haitian-Americans. Found in the suspects' possession were firearms, sets of US dollar bills, the president's personal chequebook and the server that held surveillance camera footage from his home, Le Nouvelliste newspaper reported. Taiwan confirmed that 11 of the suspects were arrested after breaking into a courtyard at its compound. What we know about the killing so far Angry civilians had joined the search for the gunmen, and helped police track down some who were hiding in bushes. The crowd set fire to three of the suspects' cars and destroyed evidence. Axes, wire-cutters, sets of US dollar bills and Colombian passports have been seized Police chief LÃ©on Charles called for calm, saying the public should not take the law into their own hands. At the news conference on Thursday, police showed reporters Colombian passports. ""Foreigners came to our country to kill the president,"" Mr Charles said, as the suspects sat on the floor behind him in handcuffs. Colombia's government has pledged to assist Haiti with its investigation efforts. Colombian police director, Gen Jorge Luis Vargas, said 17 former Colombian soldiers were thought to be involved. The US state department, meanwhile, said it could not confirm if any of its citizens had been detained. However, US and Canadian media are reporting that one of the dual citizens arrested, James Solages, 35, is from Florida and was a former bodyguard at the Canadian embassy in Haiti. An investigating judge told local media that Mr Solages and the other US citizen, named as Joseph Vincent, had said they were there as translators for the mercenaries, after finding the job on the internet. ""The mission was to arrest President Jovenel MoÃ¯se... and not to kill him,"" Judge ClÃ©ment NoÃ«l told Le Nouvelliste. The US said on Friday it was sending FBI and Department of Homeland Security officials to Haiti following the nation's request for help in the investigation. Members of Mr MoÃ¯se's security detail have been summoned before Haiti's courts to answer questions about its failures. Large crowds surrounded the PÃ©tion-Ville Police station in Port-au-Prince where the men have been detained Colombian daily El Tiempo said that it had seen confidential documents that named the Colombian suspects. The paper's research suggests that four of them flew from Colombia to the Dominican Republic on 4 June. They crossed by land from there into Haiti two days later. The two countries share the island of Hispaniola. According to El Tiempo, Colombian intelligence has seen photos posted on social media by members of the group, showing them posing at a popular tourist spot in the Dominican Republic. The killing has triggered some civil unrest in Haiti, the poorest nation in the Americas. A state of emergency remains in force across the country, while the Dominican Republic has closed its border. The situation has been unclear and is getting murkier. In this particular situation, the constitution says the National Assembly should choose another president. But disputes meant that elections scheduled for October 2019 did not take place - and Mr MoÃ¯se had been ruling by decree amid widespread protests. Amendments to the constitution - not accepted by everyone - suggest the prime minister should be the next one to take over. But Haiti has both an interim prime minister, Claude Joseph, and a new appointee, Ariel Henry, who has yet to be sworn in. Both are claiming to be in charge. On Friday, a group of political parties signed a resolution proclaiming a new president - Joseph Lambert - with Mr Henry acting as his PM.
