Mother sues Meta and Snap over daughter's suicide,"Stock photo of girl using smartphone A Connecticut woman is suing Instagram's parent company Meta and Snap Inc, alleging an addiction to their social media platforms caused the suicide of her young daughter. Selena Rodriguez, an 11-year-old resident of the town of Enfield, took her own life last year. The lawsuit alleges that her death was caused by the potentially dangerous features of the platforms. The case comes amid growing fears over the impact of social media on children. According to a statement from the Social Media Victims Law Center (SMVLC) - which filed the suit in California on behalf of Selena's mother, Tammy - the young girl suffered from an ""extreme"" addiction to Instagram and Snapchat. Ms Rodriguez confiscated her daughter's devices on multiple occasions, only to have her run away to use social media, according to the SMVLC. ""On multiple occasions, Selena received mental health treatment for her addiction,"" the statement said. ""One outpatient therapist who evaluated Selena remarked that she had never seen a patient as addicted to social media."" Before her suicide on 21 July 2021, Selena had allegedly suffered from sleep deprivation and depression for months, particularly after the Covid-19 pandemic began and she spent more time on social media. Additionally, the lawsuit alleges that Selena was repeatedly solicited for sexually exploitative content, which she ultimately shared. The images were then leaked and shared by her classmates, leading to a deterioration of her mental state and eventually to her suicide. The lawsuit, which was filed in a federal courtroom in California on Friday, alleges that both social media giants ""knowingly and purposefully"" designed and marketed products that were harmful to a ""significant"" number of their underage users. ""[The] defendants intentionally created an attractive nuisance to young children but failed to provide adequate safeguards from the harmful effects they knew were occurring on their wholly owned and controlled digital premises,"" the lawsuit says. In a statement sent to the BBC, a Snap spokesperson said the company was ""devastated"" to hear of Selena's death, although it declined to comment on the lawsuit specifically. ""Nothing is more important to us than the wellbeing of our community,"" the spokesperson said, adding that it helps people communicate with friends ""without some of the public pressure and social comparison features of traditional social media platforms"". The spokesperson added that it ""intentionally makes it hard for strangers to contact young people"" and is working with mental health organisations to provide in-app tools and resources. Meta - the parent company of Facebook - did not immediately respond to a request for comment from the BBC. The lawsuit comes as US lawmakers and the public have grown increasingly concerned over the impact of social media on young people. In November, former Facebook product manager Frances Haugen told lawmakers the company was harming children, but alleged that it ""won't make the necessary changes because they have put their astronomical profits before people"". Afterward, Meta CEO Mark Zuckerberg sent a letter to staff - made public on his Facebook page - that the company cares ""deeply about issues like safety, well-being and mental health"".

First-time buyer: 'I couldn't keep paying rent',"Jake Olenick, 24, is spending almost two-thirds of his take-home pay renting a London flat but he started to get on the property ladder last year. A new job, rigorous saving and ""lucky family circumstances"" have enabled him to buy a share of a flat in Kilburn. Jake is not alone in managing to get a foot on the housing ladder in 2021. Figures from mortgage lender Halifax suggest there were a record number of first-time buyers last year, despite rising house prices and falling affordability. Jake, who is originally from New York, graduated from Oxford University and got a job in Oxford working as a games developer in 2019. Six months ago, he landed a software development job in London and moved into a West Hampstead flat with his girlfriend. That relationship broke down in October and Jake started to pay all of the rent, which worked out at about 60% of his take-home pay. ""I couldn't keep paying that much in rent and I already knew that it's almost always much better to buy,"" he said. So he started the ball rolling on buying 40% of a flat in Kilburn, sharing ownership with a housing association. In total, he'll be paying 35% of his salary on rent, mortgage and service charge when he moves in. He said one of the main reasons he was able to do this was ""extremely lucky family circumstances"". His parents had been saving for him to go to a US university, which was much more expensive than a UK one, and they were able to cover his fees at Oxford. So when he left, he had no student loans, which helped him when viewing properties. He also managed to put aside money from his job and has been saving birthday and Christmas money his whole life. Jake is really looking forward to moving into his new flat. ""I'm very excited!"" he says. ""I'll be able to put up posters, make repairs, the oven door will close, I'll be able to sleep because the windows are insulated, triple-glazed even! ""I'll be able to afford a weekend away, maybe I'll be able to afford a keyboard so I can play piano again. All sorts of things!"" There were more than 400,000 people buying their first home in 2021, up 35% from the previous year, the Halifax said. That rate dropped by 13% in 2020, when the number of Halifax buyers was about 300,000. A stamp duty holiday that started in 2020 saw house buyers rush to pick up properties - although first-time buyers were not part of this stampede. However, this meant a number of so-called ""first-rung"" homes came on to the market, which first-time buyers took advantage of in 2021, despite hikes in property prices. Esther Dijkstra, mortgage director at Halifax, said: ""There were a number of factors influencing home-buying decisions in 2021. ""While working from home and the 'race for space' was key for many, particularly movers, it's clear that the stamp duty holiday increased the availability of first-rung homes as others moved up the ladder."" The average age of first-time buyers rose to 32, up from 29 in 2011. Ms Dijkstra said that this rise in average age was mostly due to ""the need to save a significant deposit to get on the housing ladder"". The average buyer used a Â£53,935 deposit on a first property costing Â£264,140. Because of difficulties raising a deposit, the gap between the purchase price and the deposit widened in every region in the UK, Ms Dijkstra added. It's only in three local authority areas in Scotland that homes are either more affordable - in Clackmannanshire and Moray - or as affordable - in East Ayrshire, since 2011. Houses in the rest of the UK have become less affordable since then, Halifax said. On average, properties now cost nearly seven times the annual salary of first-time buyers. The limit for affordability is considered to be four times the average income. In some areas, affordability has dropped very sharply since 2011. In one London borough, Merton, affordability has halved, with similar drops, albeit not as pronounced, in Reigate and Banstead, South Kesteven, Westminster and Ashford. Anya Martin, director of campaign group PricedOut, which pushes for more affordable housing, said: ""House prices and rents have been pushed out of reach by decades of failure to build enough homes. ""First-time buyer schemes may help a few, but ultimately they are designed to help people stretch to high prices, rather than dealing with the cause of those high prices."" Chae Sarjant, her partner, and her son Kayden (pictured) are getting a home with the help of Chae's parents Many first-time buyers get help from their parents to be able to afford a home, but some use a mortgage firm that was itself set up by frustrated first-time buyers. Retail worker Chae Sarjant is buying a home with her partner, who works for the NHS, on the same road where she grew up in East Finchley. They got a mortgage through a company called Generation Home. Chae says: ""To be honest, we couldn't have done it without them."" Her mum ""is only able to give us as much as she is because it's a loan protected by Generation Home, so she can get it back when we move and use it in retirement"" and her stepfather has also taken a stake in the property, Chae says. ""We're buying about two minutes walk from them in East Finchley,"" she says. ""It's the same road I grew up on and it means my son gets to go to the same schools I went to. ""We're all thrilled, although we're currently in conveyancing hell,"" she says. ""It's a long and very annoying process."" The family are hoping to move in February and ""we're really looking forward to settling down"". They have rented for the past four years, ""which has meant moving a lot, and I know my son is looking forward to that being over!"" she adds. She said they ""never really took the idea of buying our own place that seriously, to be honest"". ""Our salary has been eaten up by rent every month, so we have very little savings of our own and our income means most mortgage companies were giving us way less than we needed to afford anything even remotely close to our families,"" she said. Flats in East Finchley typically cost between Â£350,000 and Â£550,000, she said. ""Having my mum loan us the money makes us all a lot more comfortable,"" Chae adds. ""She's able to get the money back in the future and I'm a lot less stressed about affecting her retirement.""

More restrictions lifted as Covid cases fall,"Fans will be able to return to watch when Wales kicks-off its Six Nations in February More restrictions to people's daily lives have been eased in Wales as Omicron cases continue to decline. Pubs and restaurants in Wales can now operate outdoors without the rule of six or social distancing. All limits on sports events have been scrapped meaning thousands of fans are set to return to watch fixtures across the country. First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""We have passed the peak and the situation has improved significantly."" It is the second part of a three-week roadmap to scrap restrictions imposed because of the Omicron variant. As it happened: Drakeford slams PM as rules ease UK ministers 'distracting people from awful mess' What are the Covid rules in Wales? From a peak of more than 2,300 cases per 100,000 people in Wales, the rate has dipped below 500 on Friday. The latest infection survey from the Office for National Statistics also estimates a fall in the number of people in Wales with Covid - affecting one in 25 of the population. The number of people in hospital and in intensive care with Covid are also both declining. The first minister said: ""Omicron was another unpleasant twist to this long-running pandemic."" Mr Drakeford said decisions to lift rules in England are being to made to deflect from the ""dire difficulties the Prime Minister has created for himself"" ""We have weathered this storm together in Wales by following the rules and these measures that have kept us safe for nearly two years,"" added Mr Drakeford. ""Sadly the pandemic is not over and coronavirus is still with us but we can look forward to the future with renewed hope and with better and brighter days ahead of us."" He previously laid out a roadmap for which restrictions will be eased and when. From 15 January, numbers allowed to attend an outdoor event rose from 50 to 500 From 21 January, all limits for outdoor activities have been scrapped with crowds able to return to sporting events. On 28 January, Wales will move to alert level zero. This means nightclubs can reopen and the rule of six will be scrapped in pubs and restaurants, although Covid passes will still be required for large events, plus cinemas, nightclubs and theatres From 10 February, a three-week review cycle returns as the country is at alert level zero But the Welsh Conservatives said Mr Drakeford should set a date for all Covid-related laws - including mask wearing and self-isolation rules - to be lifted. Plaid Cymru said the Welsh government needed to set out what else it will do to help the hospitality sector. Anyone over 18 will still have to show aCovid passto go to larger outdoor event, so they can show they are either fully vaccinated or have had a negative lateral flow test in the past 24 hours. The passes, which are being scrapped in England, will also still be required in cinemas and theatres until at least the next review on 10 February. The rule of six will be lifted for pubs and restaurants outdoors from Friday Before Mr Drakeford set outhis plans to phase out the post-Christmas rules, he had faced growing pressure to ease sporting restrictions, including from the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU), whichthreatened to move Wales' Six Nations home games to England. He toldRadio Wales Breakfast: ""I don't think anybody watching objectively what is happening in England could imagine that their decisions have been made by a careful attention to public health advice and some long-term plan. ""Their announcements are entirely down to the astonishing mess they find themselves in and an effort to create headlines that will distract the public's attention from the prime minister's failings. ""Covid passes encourage people to get out and about, using venues where they know everyone else has taken precautions."" Christmas Covid rules 'cost pubs Â£16,000 each' How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? The changes mean sports fans can return to Welsh stadiums from Saturday, with Swansea City's home game against Preston North End among the first to welcome back supporters. Season ticket holder Simon Williams said: ""It's been strange when you could do a 500 mile roundtrip to go watch us away but you couldn't go 10 minutes down the road to watch at us at home."" While Lorraine Dyer said her ""football mad"" grandsons were excited to return to the Swansea.com stadium. Swansea City season ticket holder Simon Williams said: ""Football's not the same without fans in the stadium"" Calum Darling, of Club One47 in Llandudno, has said his nightclub has lost up to 95% of its trade since restrictions had come into force. ""We've always got the most restrictions imposed on us as opposed to England, Scotland, Northern Ireland,"" he said. ""It just doesn't make sense that we're always five steps behind. There's just no logic to the reasoning behind it."" Alert level zero is the lowest level of measures, where all businesses are allowed to reopen without two-metre social distancing rules in place. If all goes to plan, the rule of six will not apply in pubs, restaurants, cinemas and theatres from 28 January. However, face masks will still be required in most indoor public places,unlike England where they will not be compulsory from Thursday. Self-isolation rules also remain in force, and work from home guidance will remain advice but will not be law. Wales,along with Scotland and Northern Ireland, brought in new Covid restrictions over Christmas because of a rapid rise in cases driven by the Omicron variant. The decision to continue easing the rules comes as Wales sees the ""fastest rate of decline"" in case numbers and the lowest rate in the UK, according to Mr Drakeford. It is down 61% in a week to 490.8 cases per 100,000, the lowest since 9 December. The ONS infection survey estimates numbers infected in Wales have fallen 34% over the week, with 3.69% of the population having Covid in the week ending 15 January. The number of patients with Covid in hospital is at an average of 722, an 16% fall on last week, while numbers in critical care are the lowest since 11 August. However, Mr Drakeford added: ""We are not out of the woods yet. There are still more than 1,000 people in hospital with Covid and that is putting additional pressure on the NHS."" But the former head of Public Health Wales' communicable disease surveillance centre said the restrictions had been unnecessary and ""should have been lifted three weeks ago"". Dr Roland Salmon said: ""I've been a long time sceptic of these long-term measures such as lockdown. ""They've contributed very little while, in contrast, the vaccination programme has contributed a great deal."" Chester are an English club, insists chairman after Covid 'rule break' Wales Covid rules relaxed as cases drop rapidly Wales could be turning corner on Covid says minister The UK government said it intended to end the legal requirement for people who test positive for Covid to self-isolate in England - and replace it with advice and guidance. The current regulations around self-isolation expire on 24 March, with Prime Minister Boris Johnson suggesting he would not renew them - and that the date could be brought forward if the data allows.

US and Russia hold 'frank' talks on Ukraine tension,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov shook hands as talks proceeded at a hotel in Geneva Russia's foreign minister and his US counterpart have held what they called ""frank"" talks to try to reduce the chance of a wider conflict in Ukraine. Sergei Lavrov repeated denials that a huge Russian force assembled near Ukraine's borders would be used to invade Ukraine. Antony Blinken said America would respond severely to any invasion. Pro-Russian rebels control large parts of eastern Ukraine since a ferocious war erupted nearly eight years ago. Some 14,000 people were killed and at least two million fled their homes before fragile peace agreements were brokered. The US and its allies have threatened new sanctions if the Russian military takes action. Washington is expected to put its position in writing next week, and then further discussions will be held. With an estimated 100,000 Russian troops deployed near Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin has issued demands to the West which he says concern Russia's security, including that Ukraine be stopped from joining Nato. He wants the Western defensive alliance to abandon military exercises and stop sending weapons to eastern Europe, seeing this as a direct threat to Russia's security. EXPLAINED:Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? ATMOSPHERE:The mood in Kyiv and Moscow FROM BRUSSELS:EU 'closest to war' in decades over Russia-Ukraine crisis UK SUPPORT:UK says it is sending weapons to defend Ukraine For Mr Blinken, the talks were ""frank and substantive"" while for Mr Lavrov, they were also ""frank"" with an agreement to ""have a reasonable dialogue"". ""I hope emotions will decrease,"" Mr Lavrov added. Mr Blinken warned his Russian counterpart of a ""united, swift and severe"" response if Russia invaded. Speaking after the talks, he said the US was prepared to pursue possible means of addressing Russian concerns in the spirit of reciprocity. Beforehand, analysts mooted this might include more transparency on military exercises in the region, or reviving restrictions on missiles in Europe. These rules were previously set out in the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, a Cold War-era pact thatthe US scrapped in 2019, after accusing Russia of violating the deal. Mr Blinken also urged Russia to stop what he called its aggression towards Ukraine, saying the troop build-up gave it the ability to attack Ukraine from the south, east and north. He said the US knew from experience that Moscow, which annexed Ukraine's Crimea region back in 2014, also had an ""extensive playbook"" of non-military ways of furthering its interests, including cyber attacks. He confirmed the US would continue deliveries of ""security assistance"" to Ukraine in the coming weeks. America sent anti-tank guided missile systems to Ukraine last year, as well as small arms and ammunition. Mr Blinken said the talks had also touched on Iran and negotiations over its nuclear capabilities, which he called an example of how the US and Russia can work together on security issues. For his part, Mr Lavrov described the talks as open and useful but he accused Nato of working against Russia. He reiterated Moscow's position that it had ""never threatened the Ukrainian people"" and had no plans to attack Ukraine. He also accused the Ukrainian government of using ""state terrorism"" against the rebels in the east and ""sabotaging"" the Minsk peace agreements on the conflict there. Russia's foreign minister said the US would send ""written responses"" to all of Russia's proposals next week but Mr Blinken only said America hoped to share its ""concerns and ideas in more detail in writing next week"". In a way, the spectacle is already a win for Russia, regardless of how the crisis is resolved. This is a diplomatic conflict of Russia's making. Their force movements have prompted a week of furious activity on the part of the Americans and their allies at a time when the US would much rather be focusing on what it views as an era-defining competition with an ascendant China. Instead, Russia is once again at the centre of global attention - at least for the moment. The high-stakes negotiations in Geneva hearken back to a time decades past. As Mr Blinken heads back to the Geneva airport for his flight home to Washington, it's hard to say what, if anything, has changed in these three days of crisis diplomacy. Both sides are still talking, but talk without results only goes so far. Russia could use the US written response next week as pretext for further escalation. In Ukraine, US diplomats don't know what to expect - more cyber-warfare, a ""minor incursion"" or tens of thousands of Russian troops pouring into the country from three sides and paratroopers landing in Kyiv. Anything, they say, is possible. The US seems determined to try to keep the Russians talking until the spring rains make tank invasions impractical. As for what Russia wants, both Mr Blinken and Mr Biden have been consistent in their conclusion: it ultimately depends on what's going on in Russian President Vladimir Putin's head. Anthony's analysis in full The talks between the two diplomats came just a day after Russia unveiled plans for naval drills involving more than 140 warships and more than 60 aircraft, seen as a show of strength. Also on Thursday, the US said Russian intelligence officers had been recruiting current and former Ukrainian government officials to step in as a provisional government and co-operate with an occupying Russian force in the event of an invasion. The US treasury departmentimposed sanctions on two current Ukrainian,externalmembers of parliament and two former government officials accused of being part of the plot. Some US politicians have called on President Biden to airlift weapons to Ukrainian forces Mr Blinken arrived in Geneva after a trip to Kyiv to show support for Ukraine, and talks with Britain, France and Germany in Berlin. Several European nations have now moved to bolster Nato's military deployment in eastern Europe. Spain is sending warships to join Nato naval forces in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, and Denmark also said it would send a frigate to the Baltic Sea. French President Emmanuel Macron has offered to send troops to Romania. Earlier this week, Britain announced it was supplying Ukraine with extra troops for training and defensive weapons. This video can not be played Watch: Ukraine invasion is âa crisis with global consequencesâ In a speech on Friday, UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss called on Mr Putin to ""desist and step back from Ukraine before he makes a massive strategic mistake"" that would lead to terrible loss of life. President Biden had triggered questions about the consistency of the US line on Ukraine on Wednesday, when he bleakly predicted that Russia would ""move in"" on Ukraine, but appeared to suggest a ""minor incursion"" could attract a weaker response from the US and its allies. The message drew a rebuke from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who tweeted: ""There are no minor incursions. Just as there are no minor casualties and little grief from the loss of loved ones."" Mr Biden then sought to clarify by saying any Russian troop movement across Ukraine's border would qualify as an invasion and that Moscow would ""pay a heavy price"".

Campaigners bid to halt jabs using 'crime number',"Police asked protesters to leave the vaccination centre in Stockport, warning them they faced arrest for aggravated trespass Anti-vax campaigners are using a ""crime number"" issued to them by the police to claim vaccination centres are breaking the law. They were given the number after making a formal allegation to the Metropolitan Police that vaccines are dangerous. Police say it ""merely acknowledges"" an allegation has been received but there is currently no criminal investigation. On Thursday, campaigners tried to close a centre in Stockport, falsely claiming police were investigating a crime. Greater Manchester Police say officers were called by a group saying a crime was being committed at the health centre and it wanted the police to ""seize the evidence"". In a video shot by the protesters, one man falsely claims there is a ""live criminal case"", which will be ""fought through the courts"". Officers tell them that they will be arrested for aggravated trespass and the group then leaves the centre. The men in black fighting UK vaccine rollout Why Magna Carta wonât exempt you from lockdown rules The campaigners' claims about a police investigation stem from an allegation made to the Metropolitan Police on 20 December last year, accompanied by a large number of documents. They claim these contained evidence, gathered by a doctor and a former police officer, of the health risks of Covid vaccines. In a statement the Metropolitan Police said: ""A crime reference number was created and provided to the complainants. ""This is not an indication that an investigation is under way or that a crime has been committed. ""It merely acknowledges that an allegation has been received and recorded. ""While the assessment continues, to date there is nothing to indicate that a crime has been committed and no criminal investigation has been launched."" However, the concern is that there is a co-ordinated campaign to produce more ""evidence"" against vaccines which could take police forces months to deal with. The National Police Chiefs Council said: ""We are also aware of individuals attending police stations to report what they believe to be criminal offences relating to the Covid-19 vaccine. ""Police have a long history of upholding the right to freedom of expression. ""This must be balanced with the rights of others, keeping the public safe, preventing crime and disorder, and seeking to minimise disruption. ""Any efforts to intimidate, harass, or commit assault against emergency service workers, staff and volunteers will not be tolerated and will be treated and investigated as a criminal matter by police forces."" The visits to vaccination centres are being co-ordinated online by groups sharing a ""script"", which refers to a ""crime"" being committed, for members to deliver while talking to vaccination staff. The script says campaigners have the ""right to use force as is reasonable, necessary and proportionate in order to prevent that crime from happening"". The document also advises protesters: ""Do not become angry or disruptive to the vaccination centre.""

The mood in Kyiv and Moscow,"In recent years, many Ukrainians have grown to live with the constant risk of a further Russian invasion As concern grows that Russia will invade Ukraine, BBC correspondents gauge the public mood in Moscow and Kyiv on whether the crisis could lead to a wider war in Europe. ""You can't interview me I'm kind of famous in Ukraine ha ha!"" OK, I confess I didn't know who the woman was, but her thoughts didn't exactly seem preoccupied by a possible invasion on her country. Her mood is matched by many at the snowy Kyiv food market we cross paths in, which wouldn't look out of place on a Christmas card. ""Russia can do anything thanks to Putin, who is unpredictable,"" says Volodymyr, who's less concerned about his celebrity status. ""As long as Putin is there, risk will always remain."" And that's a sentiment echoed across Ukraine. Since Russia annexed Ukraine's southern Crimea peninsula and backed militants in the eastern Donbas region in 2014, there's been no real let-up in fighting, cyber-attacks and misinformation. Anastasia is more optimistic, saying: ""I'm not worried because we have good authorities and our president. I think they can manage it. They protect us, that's why we elected them."" Viktor isn't worried either, but does get basic military training at his university, which is common in Ukraine. ""We'd like it not to happen, but if needed, we'll be ready to properly resist the aggressor,"" he says. So would he and his friends would be willing to fight? ""Yes, there are no doubts about it,"" he replies. ""Because we need to defend our country, our independence, and most importantly, freedom."" In Moscow, many people are still unconvinced that war will happen In Russia, state-run newspapers and media outlets blame the West for aggression, mirroring the Kremlin's language. While the defence alliance, Nato, and the US warn of an imminent invasion, many people are still unconvinced that war will happen or that it would be to Russia's advantage. In central Moscow, some think that the threat has been exaggerated by the West. ""Every year, according to them, Russia plans to invade Ukraine,"" said 24-year-old Andrei. ""Meanwhile, we all sit here and listen to the news with eyes wide open and think: 'Really? Again? Weren't we supposed to invade last year?' I think the West is just using this issue for their own interests."" Olga was adamant that America was to blame for the tension and didn't see the need for war. ""What do we need Ukraine for? Leave them alone. I could understand it, to produce goods, if we had a need for more markets, more fields, but we have so much space here. We have access to the seaside. So what is it all for?"" America's proposed sanctions worry some, like Alexei. ""The rouble (Russia's currency) will fall and people will have it really bad. So this must be avoided. It is not people's fault, but it will be ordinary people who will be hit,"" he said. Analysts, journalists and politicians are still arguing about what President Vladimir Putin's long-term intentions really are. But many in Russia would be taken by surprise if war was to start soon.

False banana offers hope for warming world,"Fruit of the banana (left) and enset (right) Scientists say the plant enset, an Ethiopian staple, could be a new superfood and a lifesaver in the face of climate change. The banana-like crop has the potential to feed more than 100 million people in a warming world, according to a new study. The plant is almost unknown outside of Ethiopia, where it is used to make porridge and bread. Research suggests the crop can be grown over a much larger range in Africa. ""This is a crop that can play a really important role in addressing food security and sustainable development,"" said Dr Wendawek Abebe of Hawassa University in Awasa, Ethiopia. Enset or ""false banana"" is a close relative of the banana, but is consumed only in one part of Ethiopia. The banana-like fruit of the plant is inedible, but the starchy stems and roots can be fermented and used to make porridge and bread. The plant is a close relative of the banana and looks similar to its 'cousin' Enset is a staple in Ethiopia, where around 20 million people rely on it for food, but elsewhere it has not been cultivated, although wild relatives - which are not considered edible - grow as far south as South Africa, suggesting the plant can tolerate a much wider range. Using agricultural surveys and modelling work, scientists predicted the potential range of enset over the next four decades. They found the crop could potentially feed more than 100 million people and boost food security in Ethiopia and other African countries, including Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda. Study researcher Dr James Borrell, of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, said planting enset as a buffer crop for lean times could help boost food security. ""It's got some really unusual traits that make it absolutely unique as a crop,"" he said. ""You plant it at any time, you harvest it at any time and it's perennial. That's why they call it the tree against hunger."" Ethiopia is a major centre of crop domestication in Africa, home to coffee and many other crops. Enset reaches 10 metres (39 feet) tall Climate change is predicted to seriously affect yields and distribution of staple food crops across Africa and beyond. There is growing interest in seeking new plants to feed the world, given our reliance on a few staple crops. Nearly half of all the calories we eat come from three species - rice, wheat and maize. ""We need to diversify the plants we use globally as a species because all our eggs are in a very small basket at the moment,"" said Dr Borrell.

Covid rules will not be relaxed quicker - minister,"Wales will not lift Covid rules quicker than planned despite case rates being in rapid decline. Eluned Morgan said the level of coronavirus remains ""really high"". She also expressed concerns over signs ""in other places"" that there could be an increase in the number of cases in schools. The Welsh government announceda three week roadmap for scrapping restrictions last Friday. Last Saturday more people were allowed to attend outdoor events, while from Friday crowds can return to sporting fixtures. From 28 January nightclubs can reopen and from 10 February Wales returns to a three-week review cycle. Meanwhile the chief medical officer Frank Atherton has suggested UK officials may look at winding down mass testing in the summer. Eluned Morgan was responding to Welsh Conservative demands for measures to be eased more quickly. She accepted that case rates were plummeting but said they remained high at 572 per 100,000. Speaking in the Senedd, the health minister said: ""Now if we were in that situation in the middle of August, last year, we'd have been throwing our hands up in the air saying my God, these are high rates. ""So we've just got to just be aware that we're not out of the woods on this yet."" Wales' case rate has fallen 68% in a week - the lowest rate since mid-December. The health minister said an ""initial analysis"" suggested there would be an additional 69,000 cases in Wales if the restrictions had not been introduced. But Mr Morgan also acknowledged that the modelling upon which the Welsh government had relied was based on ""imperfect data"". ""We did peak earlier than expected. We didn't see as many hospitalizations as we had feared."" ""So some of that modelling, perhaps, wasn't where we thought it might be, but in a good way."" She added that officials have not ""quite seen what's happening"" in schools yet. ""There are signs in some other places that we see an increase in the numbers of cases in our schools. ""The concern is whether that is then going to feed into the adult population and population of older people."" Amanda Farrow said she had been 'quite scared' what could happen over Christmas Within the space of two days Amanda Farrow watched colleagues drop like flies with Omicron. ""I was actually quite scared to be honest, about what would happen,"" said the emergency department consultant at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital in Llantrisant. ""If that rate had carried on it was a significant worry about staff in particular over Christmas and new year."" While some colleagues are still off, staffing levels are far healthier she said - but the pressures have not gone away. She explained the challenge at the Royal Glamorgan is the same as so many other large hospitals. A lack of social care in the community means the transfer of patients out of hospital is delayed - patients therefore wait longer in A&E for a bed to become free on wards, meaning ambulances have long waits to offload patients into the emergency department. To free up space in the busy waiting room at A&E, the hospital has started a trial, where patients are triaged and those who could be treated at a minor injuries unit are then given an appointment at Ysbyty Cwm Rhondda, eight miles away. This video can not be played Covid: 'Further curveball possible', says Vaughan Gething Wales' chief medical officer has cautiously suggested a decision could be taken in the summer to scrap one of the key planks of the UK's pandemic response. Dr Sir Frank Atherton said there would be no need to continue with mass testing once Covid becomes a more seasonal illness. He said he is ""sure there will be a stock taking in the summer because we can't go on with this volume of testing forever - why would we want to? We don't do that with flu."" ""I think we just need to see in the summer months where we are up to in terms of what's happening globally around the development of potential new variants, where we are in the UK with the case rates and the harm that's coming from that. ""If we reach a point where there are no new variants coming which are a threat to us in the UK, and where we have low levels of infection in the UK and low levels of harm, that's the time to think about dismantling some of our infrastructure around testing."" But he gave a caveat that if Covid returned with a new variant ""we may need to restart things"".

Thanks for following today's live page. Your writers were Jen Meierhans, Victoria Lindrea, Malu Cursino and Nathan
Williams. The page was edited by Alex Therrien, Becky Morton and Lauren Turner. From all the team, have a good evening. We're coming to the end of our live coverage for the day - here's
a reminder of the key Covid stories we've been covering: Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online UK experts are keeping an eye on a variant of Omicron called BA.2. There have been 426 cases confirmed by whole genome sequencing in England so far - many in London or the South East - with the earliest logged on 6 December. That's an extremely tiny proportion of all the Omicron cases that have been occurring around the UK this winter though. The bulk of this current wave has been ""regular"" BA.1 Omicron. Despite cropping up in the news today, the BA.2 sub-lineage is not new - it has been
around in the world for a while, just like regular Omicron. Experts are
not very worried about it, but want to monitor what it is doing. In Denmark it appears to be gaining ground over BA.1. Importantly, all the evidence so far suggests that booster jabs are doing a great job against all variants of Covid in terms of preventing serious illness.  Back to the government's daily coronavirus data, let's take a look what the graphs show us. So far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - 91% of over-12s. More than 48 million - 84% of over-12s - have had both doses. While uptake of first and second doses dropped off, there had been a steep rise in people having boosters - but, booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. The latest UK R estimate from the government's scientific advisory group Sage,is between 0.7 and 0.9,external, that's up slightly from the week before. It means that, on average, every 10 people with Covid will infect between seven and nine others. But in Wales the R number is higher -here's more info. There have been protests against the new vaccine pass In
France, a new Covid pass - that will effectively ban the unvaccinated from public
life - has been approved by the country's Constitutional Council. From
24 January, people over 16 will have to show a certificate of vaccination to gain
access to a host of public venues. The
new law removes the option of showing a negative Covid test to enter places
like bars and restaurants. The
council ruled that the pass should not be required for political meetings, and should
expire as soon as it is no longer necessary. French President Emmanuel Macron caused uproar when he told Le Parisien newspaper at the beginning of
Januaryhe really wanted to ""piss off"" the unjabbed, by
""limiting as much as possible their access to activities in social
life"". Boris
Johnson is calling on teachers who are still insisting that masks should be
worn in class to follow the latest guidance. Secondary
school children in England areno longer required to have face coverings in classrooms, as the government rolls back Plan B restrictions. A
spokesman for the PM says children have been hit hard by the disruption of the
pandemic and it is ""vital that children are receiving
face-to-face education"". From 27 January the advice for masks to be worn in communal areas will also be dropped. Mary Bousted, of teaching union NEU, says schools that keep face
coverings are doing so ""following a risk assessment"". She
says it's a ""sensible precaution"" and it's ""bizarre"" that the government should seek to ""micromanage"". Andy Byers, a head teacher in County Durham,wrote to parents and students asking them to continue to wear face coverings, with Covid rates remaining high in the North East. The daily coronavirus data shows the total number of people who tested positive in the last seven days is 646,835.That's a decrease of 27% from the previous week. The seven-day average for deaths is 1,878 which is up 0.5%. The seven-day average for people admitted to hospital with Covid is 14,213 - down 9.9% on the week before. The UK has given a total of 137,022,678 coronavirus vaccinations, according to the government's daily figures. That's 52,186,398 first doses, 48,082,636 second doses and 36,753,644 third or booster doses. The UK has recorded a further 95,787 coronavirus cases, according to the government'sdaily coronavirus data,external. There were also 288 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test. On Thursday 107,364 cases and 330 deaths were reported. Blood donations kept Georgina (right) alive, when she was a newborn baby The Welsh Blood Service says donations are down because of Covid. Interim director Alan Prosser said winter was always challenging, without the added pressures of a pandemic. ""We've had to find larger venues because of social distancing, so we moved away from smaller community donation centres,"" he explains. In addition, the use of community donation vehicles in Wales was suspended because of Covid restrictions. Last month Scotland hadfewer registered blood donors than at any other point this century, and before Christmasthe Republic of Ireland was importing blood from England. Meanwhile England's hospitals got through the pandemic withthe smallest pool of donors in the 21st Century,external. Read the full story. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst It is now just two weeks until the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and Chinaâs capital city continues to try to combat an outbreak of Covid-19 under its âzero-Covid strategyâ. Officials told a press conference today that Beijing has now confirmed 23 cases of Covid-19 since 15 January. These are spread across four districts in the city, and there have been cases of both the Delta and the Omicron variant. Beijingâs deputy police chief, Pan Xuhong, told the media about some of the Covid-19 violations that police officers have had to deal with over the last week. He mentioned the case of a 51-year-old man âjumping out of a windowâ in the cityâs Changping District, in order to break quarantine. He said the man, surnamed Xie, has now been detained. He also spoke of a 46-year-old wholesaler âreplacing import labels with domestic labelsâ after the authorities warned that import goods could pose a Covid-19 risk. Xuhong said the man is now being investigated. Read more. ONS analysis suggests UK daily Covid cases in the week after Christmas were almost three times higher than the numbers shown on the government dashboard - why is this? It's because the official numbers are affected by how many people are coming forward for tests, have chosen to report their test results, or who are taking a test because they know they have coronavirus symptoms. By contrast, the ONS figures are based on analysis of nose and throat swabs taken from a representative sample of more than 150,000 people in private households. The same people are sampled every week, regardless of whether they know they have Covid-19 or have reported a positive result. The ONS then produces estimates of the likely number of new cases of coronavirus across the country. New cases of Covid-19 in the UK averaged nearly half a million a day during the week after Christmas, almost three times the official figures, new analysis suggests. An average of 173,400 new cases of coronavirus per day were recorded from 26 December to 1 January, according to the government's Covid-19 dashboard. But the true number of cases was likely to be nearer 479,100 a day, according to estimates by the Office for National Statistics. Health agencies are urging caution about interpreting the regular case numbers published each day for the UK, following changes in rules about testing. The sharp difference in totals reflects just how many new cases of Covid-19 are being missed in the dashboard figures, which count only those people who have reported themselves as having tested positive for the virus. AntÃ³nio Horta-OsÃ³rio quit as
boss of banking giant Credit Suisse for
breaking Covid rules by going to the Wimbledon tennis finals last summer. Now it's emergedhe also went to the Euros football final at Wembleyâ on the same day. Credit Suisse had organised
corporate hospitality at the events, but Horta-OsÃ³rio took family to both after
others were unable to use the tickets,the Financial Times reports,external. Horta-OsÃ³rio went to the two
big sporting events in July, at a time when the UK's Covid restrictions
required him to be in quarantine. The England-Italy Wembley
final was later declared a Covid super-spreader event, with more than 2,000
people said to have attended while ""likely to be infectious"". Alistair ColemanBBC Monitoring Groups of anti-vaccine activists are attempting to close
down a number of Covid-19 vaccination centres across the UK, falsely
claiming that ancient English law gives them the power to do so. In recent days, at least a dozen videos have appeared online showing
attempts to âserveâ papers on staff. In one case, a centre manager is heard
telling an activist that his papers are bogus, before showing him the door. The activists are using âsovereign citizenâ theory âa bogus legal concept which we recently investigated. The groups believe they can opt out of laws they donât like and become
âcommon law constablesâ to enforce their beliefs.Neither of these concepts has any
legal force. The people invading vaccine centres cite a crime
reference number (CRN) as âproofâ that crimes are being committed. One group left
a dossier at a London police station claiming the vaccine rollout is a criminal
enterprise. But the Metropolitan Police say theyhave not opened an investigation into the claims,external, and the CRN merely shows that an allegation has been received
and recorded. A CRN is no proof that a crime has been committed, police say. Downing Street says it is not investigating allegations that MPs calling for Boris Johnson's resignation have been blackmailed by government whips. Labour called for an inquiry after senior Tory MP William Wragg said threats that would ""seem to constitute blackmail"" had been made to colleagues. No 10 says it has not seen any proof of such behaviour. A spokesman says they would look ""carefully"" at any evidence presented to them but theywere not seeking it. Separately, a group of MPs known as the ""pork pie plotters"" has been meeting regularly to discuss whether to oust Johnson over revelations he attended a drinks party during lockdown. They met on Thursday to discuss going public with their own complaints of intimidation by the whips - the MPs in charge of party discipline. The Times reports,externalthey are considering releasing text messages and a secret recording of a ""heated"" conversation with the chief whip to support their claims. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Jakub Morawiecki has said the government will prepare more Covid hospital beds as it faces a surge in cases. The Polish government also announced that it will shorten Covid-19 isolation to seven days and will introduce free coronavirus tests in pharmacies across the country. As we reported earlier, Poland registered its highest number of daily infections on Friday - 36,665 new cases. This is an 128% increase from the previous week. Poland's health minister, Adam Niedzielski, warned that Poland could see around 140,000 daily Covid cases in a worst case scenario. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng says people should return to the office, as the UK needs to ""get back to some degree of normality"". On Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced an end to Plan B measures. The government isno longer asking people to work from homeand masks will no longer compulsory in public settings from 27 January. Kwarteng told LBC radio that there are ""benefits from working with colleagues, being able to interact directly with them"". He added that Covid-19 is ""turning from a pandemic into an endemic"" and ""it's something we have to live with"". Welsh Secretary Simon Hart has labelled attacks on the UK government and PM Boris Johnson by the first minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, ""an uncalled for and opportunistic insult towards medical advisers and the public"". ""It's thanks to the decisions of UK (& Welsh) Gov, scientists, families & businesses that the UK is ahead of the world in its response to Covid,"" Mr Hart wrote in a tweet. Speaking earlier at a press briefing,external, Mr Drakeford said the UK government was ""simply not functioning"" because it was occupied by the need to deflect attention from press stories about parties held at Downing Street during lockdown. ""If anybody believes that their announcements this week on coronavirus were the result of a careful consideration of the science, or because they had a well worked out plan for what they were doing, I think that would be a very optimistic view indeed,"" the first minister said. Welsh Conservatives have claimed Wales has the worst Covid mortality rate in the UK and called for a Wales-specific Covid inquiry. Allow Twitter content?

The ""day is coming"" when the use of face masks in Scotland's schools will end, a top government adviser has said. The Scottish government's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, said he believed the requirement to wear masks in schools will be withdrawn soon, but he did not know when. In England, the requirement for face masks to be worn in secondary school classrooms has been scrapped. Prof Leitch also said science had now been able to ""de-fang"" Covid, and the worst was likely behind the country. However, he warned future restrictions could still be needed. Read more.  London's major incident status is being removed, Mayor Sadiq Khan has announced. But the city will remain on high alert due to the significant threat Covid-19 and the Omicron variant still pose in the capital, he says. The major incident was declared on 18 December due to the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, a significant rise in patients in London hospitals and the impact on staff absences in frontline services. It's been ended following the gradual reduction in the number of Covid cases, manageable hospital numbers and an improvement in staff absences,Khan says.,external He is calling on the government to rethink their Covid plans and keep legislation in place to make face coverings mandatory on public transport. ""They still have a huge role to play in keeping our city open and our friends, family and communities protected,"" he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

like bars and restaurants. The
council ruled that the pass should not be required for political meetings, and should
expire as soon as it is no longer necessary. French President Emmanuel Macron caused uproar when he told Le Parisien newspaper at the beginning of
Januaryhe really wanted to ""piss off"" the unjabbed, by
""limiting as much as possible their access to activities in social
life"". Boris
Johnson is calling on teachers who are still insisting that masks should be
worn in class to follow the latest guidance. Secondary
school children in England areno longer required to have face coverings in classrooms, as the government rolls back Plan B restrictions. A
spokesman for the PM says children have been hit hard by the disruption of the
pandemic and it is ""vital that children are receiving
face-to-face education"". From 27 January the advice for masks to be worn in communal areas will also be dropped. Mary Bousted, of teaching union NEU, says schools that keep face
coverings are doing so ""following a risk assessment"". She
says it's a ""sensible precaution"" and it's ""bizarre"" that the government should seek to ""micromanage"". Andy Byers, a head teacher in County Durham,wrote to parents and students asking them to continue to wear face coverings, with Covid rates remaining high in the North East. The daily coronavirus data shows the total number of people who tested positive in the last seven days is 646,835.That's a decrease of 27% from the previous week. The seven-day average for deaths is 1,878 which is up 0.5%. The seven-day average for people admitted to hospital with Covid is 14,213 - down 9.9% on the week before. The UK has given a total of 137,022,678 coronavirus vaccinations, according to the government's daily figures. That's 52,186,398 first doses, 48,082,636 second doses and 36,753,644 third or booster doses. The UK has recorded a further 95,787 coronavirus cases, according to the government'sdaily coronavirus data,external. There were also 288 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test. On Thursday 107,364 cases and 330 deaths were reported. Blood donations kept Georgina (right) alive, when she was a newborn baby The Welsh Blood Service says donations are down because of Covid. Interim director Alan Prosser said winter was always challenging, without the added pressures of a pandemic. ""We've had to find larger venues because of social distancing, so we moved away from smaller community donation centres,"" he explains. In addition, the use of community donation vehicles in Wales was suspended because of Covid restrictions. Last month Scotland hadfewer registered blood donors than at any other point this century, and before Christmasthe Republic of Ireland was importing blood from England. Meanwhile England's hospitals got through the pandemic withthe smallest pool of donors in the 21st Century,external. Read the full story. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst It is now just two weeks until the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and Chinaâs capital city continues to try to combat an outbreak of Covid-19 under its âzero-Covid strategyâ. Officials told a press conference today that Beijing has now confirmed 23 cases of Covid-19 since 15 January. These are spread across four districts in the city, and there have been cases of both the Delta and the Omicron variant. Beijingâs deputy police chief, Pan Xuhong, told the media about some of the Covid-19 violations that police officers have had to deal with over the last week. He mentioned the case of a 51-year-old man âjumping out of a windowâ in the cityâs Changping District, in order to break quarantine. He said the man, surnamed Xie, has now been detained. He also spoke of a 46-year-old wholesaler âreplacing import labels with domestic labelsâ after the authorities warned that import goods could pose a Covid-19 risk. Xuhong said the man is now being investigated. Read more. ONS analysis suggests UK daily Covid cases in the week after Christmas were almost three times higher than the numbers shown on the government dashboard - why is this? It's because the official numbers are affected by how many people are coming forward for tests, have chosen to report their test results, or who are taking a test because they know they have coronavirus symptoms. By contrast, the ONS figures are based on analysis of nose and throat swabs taken from a representative sample of more than 150,000 people in private households. The same people are sampled every week, regardless of whether they know they have Covid-19 or have reported a positive result. The ONS then produces estimates of the likely number of new cases of coronavirus across the country. New cases of Covid-19 in the UK averaged nearly half a million a day during the week after Christmas, almost three times the official figures, new analysis suggests. An average of 173,400 new cases of coronavirus per day were recorded from 26 December to 1 January, according to the government's Covid-19 dashboard. But the true number of cases was likely to be nearer 479,100 a day, according to estimates by the Office for National Statistics. Health agencies are urging caution about interpreting the regular case numbers published each day for the UK, following changes in rules about testing. The sharp difference in totals reflects just how many new cases of Covid-19 are being missed in the dashboard figures, which count only those people who have reported themselves as having tested positive for the virus. AntÃ³nio Horta-OsÃ³rio quit as
boss of banking giant Credit Suisse for
breaking Covid rules by going to the Wimbledon tennis finals last summer. Now it's emergedhe also went to the Euros football final at Wembleyâ on the same day. Credit Suisse had organised
corporate hospitality at the events, but Horta-OsÃ³rio took family to both after
others were unable to use the tickets,the Financial Times reports,external. Horta-OsÃ³rio went to the two
big sporting events in July, at a time when the UK's Covid restrictions
required him to be in quarantine. The England-Italy Wembley
final was later declared a Covid super-spreader event, with more than 2,000
people said to have attended while ""likely to be infectious"". Alistair ColemanBBC Monitoring Groups of anti-vaccine activists are attempting to close
down a number of Covid-19 vaccination centres across the UK, falsely
claiming that ancient English law gives them the power to do so. In recent days, at least a dozen videos have appeared online showing
attempts to âserveâ papers on staff. In one case, a centre manager is heard
telling an activist that his papers are bogus, before showing him the door. The activists are using âsovereign citizenâ theory âa bogus legal concept which we recently investigated. The groups believe they can opt out of laws they donât like and become
âcommon law constablesâ to enforce their beliefs.Neither of these concepts has any
legal force. The people invading vaccine centres cite a crime
reference number (CRN) as âproofâ that crimes are being committed. One group left
a dossier at a London police station claiming the vaccine rollout is a criminal
enterprise. But the Metropolitan Police say theyhave not opened an investigation into the claims,external, and the CRN merely shows that an allegation has been received
and recorded. A CRN is no proof that a crime has been committed, police say. Downing Street says it is not investigating allegations that MPs calling for Boris Johnson's resignation have been blackmailed by government whips. Labour called for an inquiry after senior Tory MP William Wragg said threats that would ""seem to constitute blackmail"" had been made to colleagues. No 10 says it has not seen any proof of such behaviour. A spokesman says they would look ""carefully"" at any evidence presented to them but theywere not seeking it. Separately, a group of MPs known as the ""pork pie plotters"" has been meeting regularly to discuss whether to oust Johnson over revelations he attended a drinks party during lockdown. They met on Thursday to discuss going public with their own complaints of intimidation by the whips - the MPs in charge of party discipline. The Times reports,externalthey are considering releasing text messages and a secret recording of a ""heated"" conversation with the chief whip to support their claims. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Jakub Morawiecki has said the government will prepare more Covid hospital beds as it faces a surge in cases. The Polish government also announced that it will shorten Covid-19 isolation to seven days and will introduce free coronavirus tests in pharmacies across the country. As we reported earlier, Poland registered its highest number of daily infections on Friday - 36,665 new cases. This is an 128% increase from the previous week. Poland's health minister, Adam Niedzielski, warned that Poland could see around 140,000 daily Covid cases in a worst case scenario. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng says people should return to the office, as the UK needs to ""get back to some degree of normality"". On Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced an end to Plan B measures. The government isno longer asking people to work from homeand masks will no longer compulsory in public settings from 27 January. Kwarteng told LBC radio that there are ""benefits from working with colleagues, being able to interact directly with them"". He added that Covid-19 is ""turning from a pandemic into an endemic"" and ""it's something we have to live with"". Welsh Secretary Simon Hart has labelled attacks on the UK government and PM Boris Johnson by the first minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, ""an uncalled for and opportunistic insult towards medical advisers and the public"". ""It's thanks to the decisions of UK (& Welsh) Gov, scientists, families & businesses that the UK is ahead of the world in its response to Covid,"" Mr Hart wrote in a tweet. Speaking earlier at a press briefing,external, Mr Drakeford said the UK government was ""simply not functioning"" because it was occupied by the need to deflect attention from press stories about parties held at Downing Street during lockdown. ""If anybody believes that their announcements this week on coronavirus were the result of a careful consideration of the science, or because they had a well worked out plan for what they were doing, I think that would be a very optimistic view indeed,"" the first minister said. Welsh Conservatives have claimed Wales has the worst Covid mortality rate in the UK and called for a Wales-specific Covid inquiry. Allow Twitter content?

The ""day is coming"" when the use of face masks in Scotland's schools will end, a top government adviser has said. The Scottish government's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, said he believed the requirement to wear masks in schools will be withdrawn soon, but he did not know when. In England, the requirement for face masks to be worn in secondary school classrooms has been scrapped. Prof Leitch also said science had now been able to ""de-fang"" Covid, and the worst was likely behind the country. However, he warned future restrictions could still be needed. Read more.  London's major incident status is being removed, Mayor Sadiq Khan has announced. But the city will remain on high alert due to the significant threat Covid-19 and the Omicron variant still pose in the capital, he says. The major incident was declared on 18 December due to the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, a significant rise in patients in London hospitals and the impact on staff absences in frontline services. It's been ended following the gradual reduction in the number of Covid cases, manageable hospital numbers and an improvement in staff absences,Khan says.,external He is calling on the government to rethink their Covid plans and keep legislation in place to make face coverings mandatory on public transport. ""They still have a huge role to play in keeping our city open and our friends, family and communities protected,"" he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

LiveLiveQ&A: Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine?17 minutes ago,"As diplomats scramble to avert a possible new war in Europe, our expert correspondents are here to answer your questions Russia has an estimated 100,000 troops near its border with Ukraine but denies it is preparing for an invasion Earlier today, top US diplomat Antony Blinken warned his Russian counterpart of a ""severe"" response if that were to happen Vladimir Putin accuses Western forces of meddling in its neighbours and does not want Ukraine to join the Nato military alliance Steve Rosenberg, the BBC's correspondent in Moscow, has lived in Russia since the end of the Cold War Diplomatic correspondent Paul Adams has reported from conflict zones all over the world and recently returned from Ukraine Edited by Jasmine Taylor-Coleman That's all from us for now on this complex and fast-developing story - thanks for staying with us! We've tried to answer as many of your questions as possible - huge thanks go toPaul Adams, the BBC's International Affairs Correspondent who has recently returned from reporting in Ukraine, andSteve Rosenberg, our correspondent in Moscow. You can still get all the latest developments on this and other major news stories -on the BBC News website. This page was edited by Jasmine Taylor-Coleman and Kevin Ponniah. Our reporting crew were Chris Giles and Yaroslav Lukov. Paul AdamsBBC International Affairs Correspondent We're going to be wrapping up this Q&A shortly but we can't leave you without answering this - Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? The only honest answer any of us can give right now is that we have absolutely no idea. Russia has certainly assembled enough men and equipment to do something in Ukraine. Not enough (by a mile) for a full scale invasion, but enough, perhaps, to mount a more limited operation - perhaps in the Donbas. But Russians are not clamouring for war and Putin knows that ""victory"" in Ukraine could kill an awful lot of his own soldiers. Does his visceral distaste for the very idea of Ukraine trump all other rational considerations? Surely not. But he's caught the West's attention and he has a long list of demands which go way beyond the question of Ukraine and Nato (particularly as he knows Ukraine is not about to join). So he will continue to hold a gun against Ukraine's head while he pursues his wider agenda. And as any film buff will tell you, when there's a gun on the table, it usually means someone's going to use it later. Paul AdamsBBC International Affairs Correspondent Kate, 35, Washington in the US, asks why doesnât Nato agree to sign a written agreement that Ukraine will not join the military alliance? It's true that Nato has expanded eastwards, though not since 2004, when the Baltic republics of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia joined, along with Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Slovenia. Others have joined since, but Albania, Croatia, Montenegro and North Macedonia did not represent a further expansion eastwards. All joined because they wanted to be part of a security alliance that tied them to Europe and America. Some had been part of the old Warsaw Pact, which no longer existed. They no longer wanted to be part of a Russian sphere of influence (and Russia, preoccupied with its own domestic concerns, wasn't in a position to persuade them otherwise). Nato has what it calls an ""open door"" policy. Anyone can apply to join. Nato will not go against its own principles and tell aspiring countries that they are no longer welcome. But it's no secret that membership is not currently on the cards for Ukraine (for fairly obvious reasons). President Biden said as much on Wednesday. from Chris, 22, in Reading, UK Steve RosenbergBBC Moscow Correspondent Russian President Vladimir Putin rides a Harley Davidson decorated with Russian and Ukrainian flags in Crimea back in 2010 This has a lot to do with historyâ¦ and geopolitics. Both Russia and Ukraine trace their roots back to Kievan Rus, way back in the 9th Century. Itâs why many Russians feel such a close connection to their Ukrainian neighbours. In time Ukraine became part of the Tsarist empire and, later, the Soviet Union. Many here think Vladimir Putin is on an historic mission to force Ukraine back into the fold, back into Russiaâs sphere of influence. This is a president who famously told President Bush that âUkraine isnât a real countryâ. Last year, Putin wrote that âRussians and Ukrainians are one people, a single wholeâ. The Kremlin canât abide the thought of Ukraine tilting West, embracing European institutions, western democracy and - one day - joining Nato. Losing Ukraine would be a blow to Russiaâs perception of itself as a great power. If you're just joining us, welcome. There's been a lot to take in as we answer your questions on the escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine. So let's recap on the main points today: âFrankâ talks:The US and Russian met to discuss Ukraine in Geneva, with further discussions expected in the coming weeks. Russian forces:There are fears that a huge Russian military force assembled near Ukraine's borders will be used to invade. New sanctions threat:The US and its allies have threatened new sanctions, while Russia itself denies planning to attack, despite an estimated 100,000 Russian troops deployed near Ukraine. Our correspondentsPaul AdamsandSteve Rosenberghave been helping to guide you through the complexities of whatâs happening. Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring Russian troop movements are a key story on Ukrainian TV nowadays There is a lot of apprehension in Ukraine about the
possibility of a fresh Russian invasion, and there are hopes that talks between
Russia and the West will be able to avert it. ""Escalation or diplomacy?"" wondered one presenter
of the daytime news bulletin on Ukraine's popular 1+1 TV channel. As US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was meeting Russian
Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Geneva, the presenter said: ""Washington is
trying to find out whether the Kremlin will dare to launch a wide-ranging
attack on Ukraine."" In a sign of how jittery the situation is, some Ukrainians this morning
thought that such an attack has already started. Reporting about a minor earthquake, Ukraina TV said ""people
thought the bombing has begun"". The prospect of an all-out war with Russia is real for
journalists in Ukraine. One of them, Yuri Butusov, has analysed whether Russian tanks
will be able to reach the Ukrainian capital Kyiv ""within two hours"" as suggested by some social media users. His prediction is that while it is true that Russia has more
firepower, ""Ukraine has what it takes to meet the enemy and prevent a
Russian blitzkrieg"". from Nguyen Sy Nam, 19, in Vietnam Steve RosenbergBBC Moscow Correspondent In 1994, Russia signed a document that became known as the Budapest Memorandum. Among other things, it committed Moscow to respecting the independence, sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine after it got rid of its Soviet-era nuclear weapons. But 20 years later Russia invaded Ukraine, annexing Crimea and fomenting a war in eastern Ukraine. Steve RosenbergBBC Moscow Correspondent Michel in Canada asks if Putin is worried about Ukraine joining Nato, why doesn't the West invite Russia to join the alliance? It seems unthinkable now, but the idea of Russia joining Nato was something that crossed Vladimir Putin's mind twenty years ago. It never worked out. Some people think that after the end of the Cold War, a brand new European security system â including Russia â should have been created. Nato would argue that the alliance isn't the problem and rather that it's Russian aggression that threatens European security. Steve RosenbergBBC Moscow Correspondent Viktor asks what is the community in Russiaâs reaction to the demands of Putin, and what is the main narrative of the local news outlets in Russia? My local newspaper vendor Valentina tells me her customers are talking a lot about the tension and the danger of conflict. âPeople are wishing each other good health and no war!â she says. As for the state media, itâs been denying that Russia plans to invade Ukraine, dismissing Western âhysteriaâ and accusing Nato of threatening Russiaâs security. Paul AdamsBBC International Affairs Correspondent Steve answered aquestion a little earlier about whether Russia is afraid of Nato. He is right that Russia doesn't really fear Nato, but they do resent it. I travelled to Moscow with a Nato delegation in the mid-2000s. The delegation thought it was engaged in outreach but I sensed their Russian military hosts were suspicious. And when the Nato side started to talk about all the great work they were going to do in Afghanistan, I could see veterans of Russia's own, painful experience there bristling. For all the (many) toasts to brotherhood and co-operation, I think the Russians felt patronised by Nato. At the time, Russia was still smarting from its spectacular loss of global influence and Putin had yet to turn this around. It left a lasting impression on me. Steve RosenbergBBC Moscow Correspondent George, a reader, asks if the West should be concerned that if Russia does invade and is hit with new sanctions, could they choke off gas supplies? Itâs a possibility. Russia likes to portray itself as a reliable energy supplier. But in a sanctions war the energy gloves might come off. The EU relies on Russia for 40% of its gas. So any supply reduction or cuts by Russia would be felt acutely in Europe. True, Russia would lose out financially, too. But the Russians think they have an alternative market - China - and are already looking to boost energy supplies there. Paul AdamsBBC International Affairs Correspondent I'm tempted to say ""ask Danil"" (see post below), as he's living this crisis day to day. But I was in Kyiv last week and I found a mixture of apprehension and resignation. As President Zelensky says, ""what's new here?"" - Ukraine and Russia have been at loggerheads for eight years. War is already a reality, even if the conflict in the Donbas is now a frozen, low-level confrontation. I didn't detect any panic in Kyiv, but people did seem to believe that one day, unless he's stopped, Vladimir Putin will try to do something. They know where their bomb shelters are and some say they're willing to volunteer in one way or another if war breaks out. But they're really tired of the conflict and have no appetite for a fight which they know they would probably lose. Paul AdamsBBC International Affairs Correspondent Danil Gorbunov, 42, in Ukraine, asks how any military operation could be carried out - is an all-out war possible? This could play out in any number of ways, from so-called ""hybrid"" attacks  - hacking, disinformation, etc - all the way up to a full-scale invasion the likes of which Europe has not seen since World War Two. One way or another, civilians will be caught up in it. They might find themselves freezing in their homes as the power grid collapses, or trapped behind Russian lines if, as some have speculated, Russian tanks move in from the territory of neighbouring Belarus (personally I find this unlikely, but Russia seems happy to keep everyone guessing). As you know, Danil, this conflict has already claimed around 14,000 Ukrainian lives. If Russia tries to take more territory or install a more friendly regime in Kyiv, it's hard to see how this won't result in many, many casualties. Maryna Serheyeva, 47, is seen near her house near the front line in the village of Zaitseve, in the Donetsk region From Mike Hancock, 54, in Pittsburgh, US Steve RosenbergBBC Moscow Correspondent I donât believe Russian officials really fear Nato, which is a defensive alliance. According to the US secretary of state, only 6% of Russiaâs borders touch Nato countries. Is that a threat to Russian national security? Also, many Nato countries actually have good relations with Moscow; and Russia even sells weapon systems to Turkey, a Nato member. I think this is more about the Kremlin trying to carve out a sphere of influence for itself on its doorstep - and using Nato as an excuse to do that. Our correspondents have been talking a lot about Nato. So, what is it? The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation the world's most powerful regional defence alliance - that means members see an attack on any of them as an attack on all of them. It was formed in 1949 to counter the threat of post-war communist expansion as the Soviet Union sought to extend its influence in Europe after World War Two. It says its general aim is to ""safeguard the freedom, common heritage and civilisation"" of its members by promoting ""stability and wellbeing in the North Atlantic area"". It originally consisted of 12 founding members - including the UK - and it now has 30. Russiaâs Vladimir Putin wants the alliance to abandon military exercises and stop sending weapons to eastern Europe, which Moscow sees as its backyard. Find out more here. Paul AdamsBBC International Affairs Correspondent Ryan Johnston, 24, in Belfast, Northern Ireland asks: Would this story be very different if Ukraine was already a Nato member? Ukraine (and Georgia) have been on a theoretical path to Nato membership since a summit in Bucharest in 2008. But it's a long and rocky path. Since 2014, when Ukrainians got rid of a president they thought was going to side with Russia rather than Europe, the country has been at war with Russia. First Russia took over Crimea. Then it encouraged pro-Russian separatists in the south-east of the country (the area called the Donbas). Nato can't welcome members who are already involved in conflicts of this kind and there are also all sorts of other things Ukraine needs to do, in terms of political reforms, improving their military, etc. Right now, to welcome Ukraine into Nato would be seen as the ultimate red rag to a bull (Putin). So no-one thinks it's going to happen any time soon. In many ways, this is a red herring, as Putin knows perfectly well that membership is not around the corner. from Asad Ullah, a PhD student at Shandong University in China Paul AdamsBBC International Affairs Correspondent Words are one thing (and you're right - the Russians keep saying this), but actions point in another direction. The massing of forces, the support for separatists in the Donbas (including the handing out of around 1 million Russian passports), the threat of dire consequences if Ukraine does anything provocative (which, to now, it sensibly isn't). Plus, Putin's rejection of Ukraine's independent identity is not a secret - he wrote a long treatise on the subject last summer. It's easy to find on the internet, but be prepared for a deep dive into ancient Russian history. Belarus's defence ministry released photos showing Russian troops and tanks arriving for drills Our expert correspondents have been talking about the large number of Russian soldiers that are on Ukraine's borders. But where are they? Here are some satellite images and a useful map. from Hristo, 13, in Bulgaria Steve RosenbergBBC Moscow Correspondent Thereâs no war, yet, and hopefully conflict can be avoided. The diplomats are still talking. But, yes, itâs not only Ukraine thatâs worried about the possibility of war. Other countries in the region - like the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia - are concerned that any future conflict could spread to their countries. from Richard Sullivan, 53, in Gloucestershire, England Steve RosenbergBBC Moscow Correspondent Basically, Russiaâs position is: âHey, this is our country: we can move our troops wherever we want to on our territory.â The result: an estimated 100,000 Russian soldiers near Russiaâs border with Ukraine. Plus, more Russian troops arriving in Belarus for snap war games. A potential invasion force, says the West. Moscow denies it. Â© 2025 BBC.

Ukrainians wait outcome of face-off,"Christmas in Kyiv has continued as normal, with little sign of anxiety or alert Sometimes it looks a bit like a diplomatic version of ""does he take sugar?"" In Geneva and Brussels, Western diplomats face off against their Russian counterparts, discussing, among other things, Ukraine's ability as a sovereign, independent state, to shape its own destiny. But Ukraine is not there. No matter how many times senior US officials repeat the mantra ""nothing about Ukraine without Ukraine"" - and they repeat it at every opportunity - it's hard for Ukrainians to avoid wondering just what is being discussed behind their backs. With an estimated 100,000 Russian troops massed on the country's northern and eastern borders, you might think this would be cause for serious alarm. Orthodox Christmas was celebrated here last Friday, and if you stroll through Kyiv's busy Christmas markets you're not exactly assailed by a sense of heightened alert and anxiety. ""People are used to heavy times,"" says Petro Burkovsky from one of Kyiv's oldest independent think tanks, the Ilko Kucheriv Democratic Initiatives Foundation. ""In the 20th Century, we had many occasions when people lived in daily horror. It's part of their historical memory."" 10 January:Senior Russian and US diplomats met in the Swiss city of Geneva 12 January:Nato-Russia Council meets in Brussels, for the first time since 2019 13 January:The Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe meets in Vienna. The US, Russia and Ukraine are all OSCE members Ukraine's current horror has been going on for almost eight years, since masked Russian troops first appeared on the streets of Crimea. Fighting broke out in the eastern Donbas region in April 2014. Since then, 14,000 soldiers and civilians have been killed in what the government in Kyiv calls the ""Russian-Ukrainian War"". Russia insists to this day that it is not a party to the conflict. Each morning, at a short, sombre ceremony outside the defence ministry in Kyiv, Ukrainian soldiers killed on that particular calendar day since independence in 1991 are commemorated. The vast majority have died since 2014. On the morning we attend, four names are read out, each killed on 11 January. The last of them, Oleh Andriyenko, died a year ago. A ceremony takes place in Kyiv every day to commemorate those who have fallen Each name is met with a volley of gunfire and the toll of a bell. Across town, the faces of dead soldiers stare out in serried ranks from the walls of St Michael's Cathedral in a memorial that stretches for almost 100m. Passers-by stop and reflect, undeterred by the snow and freezing temperatures. Viktor Moroshan, 63, was injured during the ferocious battle for Ilovaisk in August and September 2014. He points to the faces of fallen colleagues from the volunteer Donbas Battalion, which took heavy losses. ""Everyone had one goal,"" he says finally. ""To liberate our land from those Russians."" Viktor met his wife, Tetyana, while he was recovering in the hospital in where she was a volunteer. ""Maybe the war will be big next time,"" she says. ""He [Putin] has a lot of plans to start a new war. It's not a fairy tale."" Viktor describes himself as ethnically Russian, from one of the areas now under rebel control. But his hatred for Russian leader Vladimir Putin is deep. ""He's a maniac. A killer."" Retired now, he says he still keeps an emergency bulletproof vest and helmet ready. ""My wife says 'Vitya, maybe you shouldn't.' But I say we need to be ready. No-one else can defend our fatherland but us."" It's the kind of defiant talk you might expect in a country facing potentially overwhelming odds and knowing that if it comes to a fight, there will be limits to support from outside. WHAT NEXT?Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? EUROPE'S ROLEEU looks for role in Russian row with West RUSSIA'S MOVES:What is Vladimir Putin planning? PEACE HOPES:Can a solution be found for war in Ukraine's east? Ukraine's Western allies talk of ""massive"" consequences if Russia mounts an incursion. But while those could well include increased military assistance, it would be Ukrainians alone doing the fighting and the dying. Hence the growing support for Nato membership. ""Every time Russia starts an escalation in the front line, support for Nato membership grows,"" says Petro Burkovsky, ""and the readiness to make concessions with Russia falls."" Publicly, Nato leaders say the door to membership, opened to Ukraine and Georgia in 2008, is still open. Ukraine's deputy prime minister, visiting Nato headquarters in Brussels on Monday, repeated her government's refrain. ""We have the inherent, sovereign right to choose our own security arrangements,"" Olga Stefanishyna told reporters. ""Including treaties and alliances."" But it's hardly a secret that Nato membership is not on the cards right now. Western officials know it's the very thing most likely to provoke the military confrontation they're so anxious to avoid. Mr Burkovsky says Ukraine has little choice but to wait out a slow-burning, long-term crisis. ""Right now we have to accept the reality of confrontation and conflict with Russia,"" he says. ""Maybe in the course of time, the situation in Russia will change. Russia will not be as formidable as it is now, Ukraine will be stronger and the West will be more decisive towards Ukraine and towards Russia."" For the time being, he says, Ukraine should concentrate on avoiding the fate of two of Russia's other neighbours, Belarus and Kazakhstan. ""They show the fate of people in countries that are Russian satellites,"" he says. ""Most people in Ukraine don't want this destiny for them and of course for their children.""

"Step back from Ukraine, Truss urges Putin","A Ukrainian soldier on the frontline in Zolote, Ukraine The Russian government will be ""punished"" if it ""crosses the line"" on Ukraine, Downing Street has warned. The PM's deputy official spokesman said ""any destabilising action"" by Russia would be a strategic mistake with significant consequences. The warning came as the US and Russia held urgent talks in a bid to avert further conflict on Ukraine's border. Russia denies it is planning an invasion but has moved 100,000 troops near to its border with Ukraine. It has seized Ukrainian territory before - Crimea, in 2014 - and the head ofthe military alliance Natohas warned there is a real risk of a fresh conflict in Europe. President Vladimir Putin has made a series of demands to the West, insisting Ukraine should never be allowed to join Nato and that Nato abandons military activity in eastern Europe. Nato's 30 members - including the UK, US and several former Soviet Union states which share a border with Russia - agree that an armed attack against one is an attack against them all, and they will come to the aid of one another. Downing Street said the UK was ""working closely with our partners, including the US, to draw up a package of sweeping measures to make sure that the Russian government is punished if it crosses the line"". ""The only way forward is for Russia to deescalate and engage in meaningful discussions,"" the spokesman said. EXPLAINED:Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? FROM KYIV:Ukrainians wait as Russia faces off with the West FROM BRUSSELS:EU 'closest to war' in decades over Russia-Ukraine crisis UK SUPPORT:UK says it is sending weapons to defend Ukraine What do you want to know about the tensions between Russia and Ukraine? Emailyourquestions@bbc.co.uk,external Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov and US Secretary of State Antony Blinkenheld talks in Geneva earlier, in a bid to defuse tensions. Speaking afterwards, Mr Lavrov said the discussion - which lasted just over an hour - was open and useful, adding that he hoped emotions would cool after the ""frank"" talks. He added Russia had never threatened ""the Ukrainian people"". Mr Blinken said the US and its allies were prepared to look at addressing Russia's security concerns, but only if Russia reciprocated. He said Russia now faced a choice between diplomacy or conflict. The pair agreed to further discussions in the coming weeks. Russia's president has long claimed that the US broke a guarantee it made in 1990 that Nato would not expand further east. ""They simply deceived us!"" he said at a news conference last month. Interpretations differ over what exactly was promised to the then-Soviet leader, Mikhail Gorbachev. But it is clear that Mr Putin believes the guarantee was made. Since then, several central and eastern European countries, which used to be part of the Soviet Union or its sphere of influence, have joined Nato. Four of them - Poland, Lithuania, Latvia and Estonia - have borders with Russia. Russia argues that this expansion, and the presence of Nato troops and military equipment near its borders, is a direct threat to its security. The country seized and annexed the Crimean peninsula in southern Ukraine in 2014 after Ukrainians overthrew their pro-Russian president. Ever since, Ukraine's military has been locked in a war with Russian-backed rebels in areas of the east near Russia's borders. There are fears that the conflict, which has claimed 14,000 lives and caused at least two million people to flee their homes, may reignite and that Russia's military will cross the border. This video can not be played Russian troop build-up: View from Ukraine front line The talks came shortly after UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss accused Russia of wanting to recreate the Soviet Union ""or a kind of greater Russia, carving up territory based on ethnicity and language"". Mr Putin must ""desist and step back from Ukraine before he makes a massive strategic mistake"", she said in a speech in Sydney, Australia, adding the UK was prepared to put severe sanctions in place. And she warned that an invasion would ""only lead to a terrible quagmire and loss of life, as we know from the Soviet-Afghan war and conflict in Chechnya"". The Soviet war in Afghanistan stretched throughout the 1980s. Some 15,000 Red Army soldiers and more than a million Afghans were killed and the country was left in ruins. Earlier this week, Britain announced it was supplying Ukraine withdefensive weapons and extra troopsfor training. Meanwhile, Ukraine's ambassador to the UK, Vadym Prystaiko, said Russia's latest actions had already succeeded in diverting attention away from the ongoing conflict. He told the BBC he still believed there was ""a slight possibility"" that a ""catastrophe"" could still be averted, but said: ""Sooner or later Putin will have to do something: either withdraw or move ahead."" He said he understood Russia's fears about Nato expansion into eastern Europe, but said Ukraine's primary concerns were for their own people and Nato's military alliance was ""the best we can have in this part of the globe"". Asked whether Ukraine would join Nato, he said: ""One day, we will."" Has Putin's war in Ukraine failed?

We've tried to answer as many of your questions as possible - huge thanks go toPaul Adams, the BBC's International Affairs Correspondent who has recently returned from reporting in Ukraine, andSteve Rosenberg, our correspondent in Moscow. You can still get all the latest developments on this and other major news stories -on the BBC News website. This page was edited by Jasmine Taylor-Coleman and Kevin Ponniah. Our reporting crew were Chris Giles and Yaroslav Lukov. Paul AdamsBBC International Affairs Correspondent We're going to be wrapping up this Q&A shortly but we can't leave you without answering this - Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? The only honest answer any of us can give right now is that we have absolutely no idea. Russia has certainly assembled enough men and equipment to do something in Ukraine. Not enough (by a mile) for a full scale invasion, but enough, perhaps, to mount a more limited operation - perhaps in the Donbas. But Russians are not clamouring for war and Putin knows that ""victory"" in Ukraine could kill an awful lot of his own soldiers. Does his visceral distaste for the very idea of Ukraine trump all other rational considerations? Surely not. But he's caught the West's attention and he has a long list of demands which go way beyond the question of Ukraine and Nato (particularly as he knows Ukraine is not about to join). So he will continue to hold a gun against Ukraine's head while he pursues his wider agenda. And as any film buff will tell you, when there's a gun on the table, it usually means someone's going to use it later. Paul AdamsBBC International Affairs Correspondent Kate, 35, Washington in the US, asks why doesnât Nato agree to sign a written agreement that Ukraine will not join the military alliance? It's true that Nato has expanded eastwards, though not since 2004, when the Baltic republics of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia joined, along with Romania, Bulgaria, Slovakia and Slovenia. Others have joined since, but Albania, Croatia, Montenegro and North Macedonia did not represent a further expansion eastwards. All joined because they wanted to be part of a security alliance that tied them to Europe and America. Some had been part of the old Warsaw Pact, which no longer existed. They no longer wanted to be part of a Russian sphere of influence (and Russia, preoccupied with its own domestic concerns, wasn't in a position to persuade them otherwise). Nato has what it calls an ""open door"" policy. Anyone can apply to join. Nato will not go against its own principles and tell aspiring countries that they are no longer welcome. But it's no secret that membership is not currently on the cards for Ukraine (for fairly obvious reasons). President Biden said as much on Wednesday. from Chris, 22, in Reading, UK Steve RosenbergBBC Moscow Correspondent Russian President Vladimir Putin rides a Harley Davidson decorated with Russian and Ukrainian flags in Crimea back in 2010 This has a lot to do with historyâ¦ and geopolitics. Both Russia and Ukraine trace their roots back to Kievan Rus, way back in the 9th Century. Itâs why many Russians feel such a close connection to their Ukrainian neighbours. In time Ukraine became part of the Tsarist empire and, later, the Soviet Union. Many here think Vladimir Putin is on an historic mission to force Ukraine back into the fold, back into Russiaâs sphere of influence. This is a president who famously told President Bush that âUkraine isnât a real countryâ. Last year, Putin wrote that âRussians and Ukrainians are one people, a single wholeâ. The Kremlin canât abide the thought of Ukraine tilting West, embracing European institutions, western democracy and - one day - joining Nato. Losing Ukraine would be a blow to Russiaâs perception of itself as a great power. If you're just joining us, welcome. There's been a lot to take in as we answer your questions on the escalating tensions between Russia and Ukraine. So let's recap on the main points today: âFrankâ talks:The US and Russian met to discuss Ukraine in Geneva, with further discussions expected in the coming weeks. Russian forces:There are fears that a huge Russian military force assembled near Ukraine's borders will be used to invade. New sanctions threat:The US and its allies have threatened new sanctions, while Russia itself denies planning to attack, despite an estimated 100,000 Russian troops deployed near Ukraine. Our correspondentsPaul AdamsandSteve Rosenberghave been helping to guide you through the complexities of whatâs happening. Vitaliy ShevchenkoBBC Monitoring Russian troop movements are a key story on Ukrainian TV nowadays There is a lot of apprehension in Ukraine about the
possibility of a fresh Russian invasion, and there are hopes that talks between
Russia and the West will be able to avert it. ""Escalation or diplomacy?"" wondered one presenter
of the daytime news bulletin on Ukraine's popular 1+1 TV channel. As US Secretary of State Antony Blinken was meeting Russian
Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov in Geneva, the presenter said: ""Washington is
trying to find out whether the Kremlin will dare to launch a wide-ranging
attack on Ukraine."" In a sign of how jittery the situation is, some Ukrainians this morning
thought that such an attack has already started. Reporting about a minor earthquake, Ukraina TV said ""people
thought the bombing has begun"". The prospect of an all-out war with Russia is real for
journalists in Ukraine. One of them, Yuri Butusov, has analysed whether Russian tanks
will be able to reach the Ukrainian capital Kyiv ""within two hours"" as suggested by some social media users. His prediction is that while it is true that Russia has more
firepower, ""Ukraine has what it takes to meet the enemy and prevent a
Russian blitzkrieg"". from Nguyen Sy Nam, 19, in Vietnam Steve RosenbergBBC Moscow Correspondent In 1994, Russia signed a document that became known as the Budapest Memorandum. Among other things, it committed Moscow to respecting the independence, sovereignty and the existing borders of Ukraine after it got rid of its Soviet-era nuclear weapons. But 20 years later Russia invaded Ukraine, annexing Crimea and fomenting a war in eastern Ukraine. Steve RosenbergBBC Moscow Correspondent Michel in Canada asks if Putin is worried about Ukraine joining Nato, why doesn't the West invite Russia to join the alliance? It seems unthinkable now, but the idea of Russia joining Nato was something that crossed Vladimir Putin's mind twenty years ago. It never worked out. Some people think that after the end of the Cold War, a brand new European security system â including Russia â should have been created. Nato would argue that the alliance isn't the problem and rather that it's Russian aggression that threatens European security. Steve RosenbergBBC Moscow Correspondent Viktor asks what is the community in Russiaâs reaction to the demands of Putin, and what is the main narrative of the local news outlets in Russia? My local newspaper vendor Valentina tells me her customers are talking a lot about the tension and the danger of conflict. âPeople are wishing each other good health and no war!â she says. As for the state media, itâs been denying that Russia plans to invade Ukraine, dismissing Western âhysteriaâ and accusing Nato of threatening Russiaâs security. Paul AdamsBBC International Affairs Correspondent Steve answered aquestion a little earlier about whether Russia is afraid of Nato. He is right that Russia doesn't really fear Nato, but they do resent it. I travelled to Moscow with a Nato delegation in the mid-2000s. The delegation thought it was engaged in outreach but I sensed their Russian military hosts were suspicious. And when the Nato side started to talk about all the great work they were going to do in Afghanistan, I could see veterans of Russia's own, painful experience there bristling. For all the (many) toasts to brotherhood and co-operation, I think the Russians felt patronised by Nato. At the time, Russia was still smarting from its spectacular loss of global influence and Putin had yet to turn this around. It left a lasting impression on me. Steve RosenbergBBC Moscow Correspondent George, a reader, asks if the West should be concerned that if Russia does invade and is hit with new sanctions, could they choke off gas supplies? Itâs a possibility. Russia likes to portray itself as a reliable energy supplier. But in a sanctions war the energy gloves might come off. The EU relies on Russia for 40% of its gas. So any supply reduction or cuts by Russia would be felt acutely in Europe. True, Russia would lose out financially, too. But the Russians think they have an alternative market - China - and are already looking to boost energy supplies there. Paul AdamsBBC International Affairs Correspondent I'm tempted to say ""ask Danil"" (see post below), as he's living this crisis day to day. But I was in Kyiv last week and I found a mixture of apprehension and resignation. As President Zelensky says, ""what's new here?"" - Ukraine and Russia have been at loggerheads for eight years. War is already a reality, even if the conflict in the Donbas is now a frozen, low-level confrontation. I didn't detect any panic in Kyiv, but people did seem to believe that one day, unless he's stopped, Vladimir Putin will try to do something. They know where their bomb shelters are and some say they're willing to volunteer in one way or another if war breaks out. But they're really tired of the conflict and have no appetite for a fight which they know they would probably lose. Paul AdamsBBC International Affairs Correspondent Danil Gorbunov, 42, in Ukraine, asks how any military operation could be carried out - is an all-out war possible? This could play out in any number of ways, from so-called ""hybrid"" attacks  - hacking, disinformation, etc - all the way up to a full-scale invasion the likes of which Europe has not seen since World War Two. One way or another, civilians will be caught up in it. They might find themselves freezing in their homes as the power grid collapses, or trapped behind Russian lines if, as some have speculated, Russian tanks move in from the territory of neighbouring Belarus (personally I find this unlikely, but Russia seems happy to keep everyone guessing). As you know, Danil, this conflict has already claimed around 14,000 Ukrainian lives. If Russia tries to take more territory or install a more friendly regime in Kyiv, it's hard to see how this won't result in many, many casualties. Maryna Serheyeva, 47, is seen near her house near the front line in the village of Zaitseve, in the Donetsk region From Mike Hancock, 54, in Pittsburgh, US Steve RosenbergBBC Moscow Correspondent I donât believe Russian officials really fear Nato, which is a defensive alliance. According to the US secretary of state, only 6% of Russiaâs borders touch Nato countries. Is that a threat to Russian national security? Also, many Nato countries actually have good relations with Moscow; and Russia even sells weapon systems to Turkey, a Nato member. I think this is more about the Kremlin trying to carve out a sphere of influence for itself on its doorstep - and using Nato as an excuse to do that. Our correspondents have been talking a lot about Nato. So, what is it? The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation the world's most powerful regional defence alliance - that means members see an attack on any of them as an attack on all of them. It was formed in 1949 to counter the threat of post-war communist expansion as the Soviet Union sought to extend its influence in Europe after World War Two. It says its general aim is to ""safeguard the freedom, common heritage and civilisation"" of its members by promoting ""stability and wellbeing in the North Atlantic area"". It originally consisted of 12 founding members - including the UK - and it now has 30. Russiaâs Vladimir Putin wants the alliance to abandon military exercises and stop sending weapons to eastern Europe, which Moscow sees as its backyard. Find out more here. Paul AdamsBBC International Affairs Correspondent Ryan Johnston, 24, in Belfast, Northern Ireland asks: Would this story be very different if Ukraine was already a Nato member? Ukraine (and Georgia) have been on a theoretical path to Nato membership since a summit in Bucharest in 2008. But it's a long and rocky path. Since 2014, when Ukrainians got rid of a president they thought was going to side with Russia rather than Europe, the country has been at war with Russia. First Russia took over Crimea. Then it encouraged pro-Russian separatists in the south-east of the country (the area called the Donbas). Nato can't welcome members who are already involved in conflicts of this kind and there are also all sorts of other things Ukraine needs to do, in terms of political reforms, improving their military, etc. Right now, to welcome Ukraine into Nato would be seen as the ultimate red rag to a bull (Putin). So no-one thinks it's going to happen any time soon. In many ways, this is a red herring, as Putin knows perfectly well that membership is not around the corner. from Asad Ullah, a PhD student at Shandong University in China Paul AdamsBBC International Affairs Correspondent Words are one thing (and you're right - the Russians keep saying this), but actions point in another direction. The massing of forces, the support for separatists in the Donbas (including the handing out of around 1 million Russian passports), the threat of dire consequences if Ukraine does anything provocative (which, to now, it sensibly isn't). Plus, Putin's rejection of Ukraine's independent identity is not a secret - he wrote a long treatise on the subject last summer. It's easy to find on the internet, but be prepared for a deep dive into ancient Russian history. Belarus's defence ministry released photos showing Russian troops and tanks arriving for drills Our expert correspondents have been talking about the large number of Russian soldiers that are on Ukraine's borders. But where are they? Here are some satellite images and a useful map. from Hristo, 13, in Bulgaria Steve RosenbergBBC Moscow Correspondent Thereâs no war, yet, and hopefully conflict can be avoided. The diplomats are still talking. But, yes, itâs not only Ukraine thatâs worried about the possibility of war. Other countries in the region - like the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia - are concerned that any future conflict could spread to their countries. from Richard Sullivan, 53, in Gloucestershire, England Steve RosenbergBBC Moscow Correspondent Basically, Russiaâs position is: âHey, this is our country: we can move our troops wherever we want to on our territory.â The result: an estimated 100,000 Russian soldiers near Russiaâs border with Ukraine. Plus, more Russian troops arriving in Belarus for snap war games. A potential invasion force, says the West. Moscow denies it. Â© 2025 BBC.

I think this is more about the Kremlin trying to carve out a sphere of influence for itself on its doorstep - and using Nato as an excuse to do that. Our correspondents have been talking a lot about Nato. So, what is it? The North Atlantic Treaty Organisation the world's most powerful regional defence alliance - that means members see an attack on any of them as an attack on all of them. It was formed in 1949 to counter the threat of post-war communist expansion as the Soviet Union sought to extend its influence in Europe after World War Two. It says its general aim is to ""safeguard the freedom, common heritage and civilisation"" of its members by promoting ""stability and wellbeing in the North Atlantic area"". It originally consisted of 12 founding members - including the UK - and it now has 30. Russiaâs Vladimir Putin wants the alliance to abandon military exercises and stop sending weapons to eastern Europe, which Moscow sees as its backyard. Find out more here. Paul AdamsBBC International Affairs Correspondent Ryan Johnston, 24, in Belfast, Northern Ireland asks: Would this story be very different if Ukraine was already a Nato member? Ukraine (and Georgia) have been on a theoretical path to Nato membership since a summit in Bucharest in 2008. But it's a long and rocky path. Since 2014, when Ukrainians got rid of a president they thought was going to side with Russia rather than Europe, the country has been at war with Russia. First Russia took over Crimea. Then it encouraged pro-Russian separatists in the south-east of the country (the area called the Donbas). Nato can't welcome members who are already involved in conflicts of this kind and there are also all sorts of other things Ukraine needs to do, in terms of political reforms, improving their military, etc. Right now, to welcome Ukraine into Nato would be seen as the ultimate red rag to a bull (Putin). So no-one thinks it's going to happen any time soon. In many ways, this is a red herring, as Putin knows perfectly well that membership is not around the corner. from Asad Ullah, a PhD student at Shandong University in China Paul AdamsBBC International Affairs Correspondent Words are one thing (and you're right - the Russians keep saying this), but actions point in another direction. The massing of forces, the support for separatists in the Donbas (including the handing out of around 1 million Russian passports), the threat of dire consequences if Ukraine does anything provocative (which, to now, it sensibly isn't). Plus, Putin's rejection of Ukraine's independent identity is not a secret - he wrote a long treatise on the subject last summer. It's easy to find on the internet, but be prepared for a deep dive into ancient Russian history. Belarus's defence ministry released photos showing Russian troops and tanks arriving for drills Our expert correspondents have been talking about the large number of Russian soldiers that are on Ukraine's borders. But where are they? Here are some satellite images and a useful map. from Hristo, 13, in Bulgaria Steve RosenbergBBC Moscow Correspondent Thereâs no war, yet, and hopefully conflict can be avoided. The diplomats are still talking. But, yes, itâs not only Ukraine thatâs worried about the possibility of war. Other countries in the region - like the Baltic states of Latvia, Lithuania and Estonia - are concerned that any future conflict could spread to their countries. from Richard Sullivan, 53, in Gloucestershire, England Steve RosenbergBBC Moscow Correspondent Basically, Russiaâs position is: âHey, this is our country: we can move our troops wherever we want to on our territory.â The result: an estimated 100,000 Russian soldiers near Russiaâs border with Ukraine. Plus, more Russian troops arriving in Belarus for snap war games. A potential invasion force, says the West. Moscow denies it. Â© 2025 BBC.

"False banana offers hope for warming worldThe banana-like crop has the potential to feed more than 100 million people, according to research.Science & Environment","Fruit of the banana (left) and enset (right) Scientists say the plant enset, an Ethiopian staple, could be a new superfood and a lifesaver in the face of climate change. The banana-like crop has the potential to feed more than 100 million people in a warming world, according to a new study. The plant is almost unknown outside of Ethiopia, where it is used to make porridge and bread. Research suggests the crop can be grown over a much larger range in Africa. ""This is a crop that can play a really important role in addressing food security and sustainable development,"" said Dr Wendawek Abebe of Hawassa University in Awasa, Ethiopia. Enset or ""false banana"" is a close relative of the banana, but is consumed only in one part of Ethiopia. The banana-like fruit of the plant is inedible, but the starchy stems and roots can be fermented and used to make porridge and bread. The plant is a close relative of the banana and looks similar to its 'cousin' Enset is a staple in Ethiopia, where around 20 million people rely on it for food, but elsewhere it has not been cultivated, although wild relatives - which are not considered edible - grow as far south as South Africa, suggesting the plant can tolerate a much wider range. Using agricultural surveys and modelling work, scientists predicted the potential range of enset over the next four decades. They found the crop could potentially feed more than 100 million people and boost food security in Ethiopia and other African countries, including Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda. Study researcher Dr James Borrell, of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, said planting enset as a buffer crop for lean times could help boost food security. ""It's got some really unusual traits that make it absolutely unique as a crop,"" he said. ""You plant it at any time, you harvest it at any time and it's perennial. That's why they call it the tree against hunger."" Ethiopia is a major centre of crop domestication in Africa, home to coffee and many other crops. Enset reaches 10 metres (39 feet) tall Climate change is predicted to seriously affect yields and distribution of staple food crops across Africa and beyond. There is growing interest in seeking new plants to feed the world, given our reliance on a few staple crops. Nearly half of all the calories we eat come from three species - rice, wheat and maize. ""We need to diversify the plants we use globally as a species because all our eggs are in a very small basket at the moment,"" said Dr Borrell.

Thanks for following today's live page. Your writers were Jen Meierhans, Victoria Lindrea, Malu Cursino and Nathan
Williams. The page was edited by Alex Therrien, Becky Morton and Lauren Turner. From all the team, have a good evening. We're coming to the end of our live coverage for the day - here's
a reminder of the key Covid stories we've been covering: Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online UK experts are keeping an eye on a variant of Omicron called BA.2. There have been 426 cases confirmed by whole genome sequencing in England so far - many in London or the South East - with the earliest logged on 6 December. That's an extremely tiny proportion of all the Omicron cases that have been occurring around the UK this winter though. The bulk of this current wave has been ""regular"" BA.1 Omicron. Despite cropping up in the news today, the BA.2 sub-lineage is not new - it has been
around in the world for a while, just like regular Omicron. Experts are
not very worried about it, but want to monitor what it is doing. In Denmark it appears to be gaining ground over BA.1. Importantly, all the evidence so far suggests that booster jabs are doing a great job against all variants of Covid in terms of preventing serious illness.  Back to the government's daily coronavirus data, let's take a look what the graphs show us. So far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - 91% of over-12s. More than 48 million - 84% of over-12s - have had both doses. While uptake of first and second doses dropped off, there had been a steep rise in people having boosters - but, booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. The latest UK R estimate from the government's scientific advisory group Sage,is between 0.7 and 0.9,external, that's up slightly from the week before. It means that, on average, every 10 people with Covid will infect between seven and nine others. But in Wales the R number is higher -here's more info. There have been protests against the new vaccine pass In
France, a new Covid pass - that will effectively ban the unvaccinated from public
life - has been approved by the country's Constitutional Council. From
24 January, people over 16 will have to show a certificate of vaccination to gain
access to a host of public venues. The
new law removes the option of showing a negative Covid test to enter places
like bars and restaurants. The
council ruled that the pass should not be required for political meetings, and should
expire as soon as it is no longer necessary. French President Emmanuel Macron caused uproar when he told Le Parisien newspaper at the beginning of
Januaryhe really wanted to ""piss off"" the unjabbed, by
""limiting as much as possible their access to activities in social
life"". Boris
Johnson is calling on teachers who are still insisting that masks should be
worn in class to follow the latest guidance. Secondary
school children in England areno longer required to have face coverings in classrooms, as the government rolls back Plan B restrictions. A
spokesman for the PM says children have been hit hard by the disruption of the
pandemic and it is ""vital that children are receiving
face-to-face education"". From 27 January the advice for masks to be worn in communal areas will also be dropped. Mary Bousted, of teaching union NEU, says schools that keep face
coverings are doing so ""following a risk assessment"". She
says it's a ""sensible precaution"" and it's ""bizarre"" that the government should seek to ""micromanage"". Andy Byers, a head teacher in County Durham,wrote to parents and students asking them to continue to wear face coverings, with Covid rates remaining high in the North East. The daily coronavirus data shows the total number of people who tested positive in the last seven days is 646,835.That's a decrease of 27% from the previous week. The seven-day average for deaths is 1,878 which is up 0.5%. The seven-day average for people admitted to hospital with Covid is 14,213 - down 9.9% on the week before. The UK has given a total of 137,022,678 coronavirus vaccinations, according to the government's daily figures. That's 52,186,398 first doses, 48,082,636 second doses and 36,753,644 third or booster doses. The UK has recorded a further 95,787 coronavirus cases, according to the government'sdaily coronavirus data,external. There were also 288 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test. On Thursday 107,364 cases and 330 deaths were reported. Blood donations kept Georgina (right) alive, when she was a newborn baby The Welsh Blood Service says donations are down because of Covid. Interim director Alan Prosser said winter was always challenging, without the added pressures of a pandemic. ""We've had to find larger venues because of social distancing, so we moved away from smaller community donation centres,"" he explains. In addition, the use of community donation vehicles in Wales was suspended because of Covid restrictions. Last month Scotland hadfewer registered blood donors than at any other point this century, and before Christmasthe Republic of Ireland was importing blood from England. Meanwhile England's hospitals got through the pandemic withthe smallest pool of donors in the 21st Century,external. Read the full story. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst It is now just two weeks until the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and Chinaâs capital city continues to try to combat an outbreak of Covid-19 under its âzero-Covid strategyâ. Officials told a press conference today that Beijing has now confirmed 23 cases of Covid-19 since 15 January. These are spread across four districts in the city, and there have been cases of both the Delta and the Omicron variant. Beijingâs deputy police chief, Pan Xuhong, told the media about some of the Covid-19 violations that police officers have had to deal with over the last week. He mentioned the case of a 51-year-old man âjumping out of a windowâ in the cityâs Changping District, in order to break quarantine. He said the man, surnamed Xie, has now been detained. He also spoke of a 46-year-old wholesaler âreplacing import labels with domestic labelsâ after the authorities warned that import goods could pose a Covid-19 risk. Xuhong said the man is now being investigated. Read more. ONS analysis suggests UK daily Covid cases in the week after Christmas were almost three times higher than the numbers shown on the government dashboard - why is this? It's because the official numbers are affected by how many people are coming forward for tests, have chosen to report their test results, or who are taking a test because they know they have coronavirus symptoms. By contrast, the ONS figures are based on analysis of nose and throat swabs taken from a representative sample of more than 150,000 people in private households. The same people are sampled every week, regardless of whether they know they have Covid-19 or have reported a positive result. The ONS then produces estimates of the likely number of new cases of coronavirus across the country. New cases of Covid-19 in the UK averaged nearly half a million a day during the week after Christmas, almost three times the official figures, new analysis suggests. An average of 173,400 new cases of coronavirus per day were recorded from 26 December to 1 January, according to the government's Covid-19 dashboard. But the true number of cases was likely to be nearer 479,100 a day, according to estimates by the Office for National Statistics. Health agencies are urging caution about interpreting the regular case numbers published each day for the UK, following changes in rules about testing. The sharp difference in totals reflects just how many new cases of Covid-19 are being missed in the dashboard figures, which count only those people who have reported themselves as having tested positive for the virus. AntÃ³nio Horta-OsÃ³rio quit as
boss of banking giant Credit Suisse for
breaking Covid rules by going to the Wimbledon tennis finals last summer. Now it's emergedhe also went to the Euros football final at Wembleyâ on the same day. Credit Suisse had organised
corporate hospitality at the events, but Horta-OsÃ³rio took family to both after
others were unable to use the tickets,the Financial Times reports,external. Horta-OsÃ³rio went to the two
big sporting events in July, at a time when the UK's Covid restrictions
required him to be in quarantine. The England-Italy Wembley
final was later declared a Covid super-spreader event, with more than 2,000
people said to have attended while ""likely to be infectious"". Alistair ColemanBBC Monitoring Groups of anti-vaccine activists are attempting to close
down a number of Covid-19 vaccination centres across the UK, falsely
claiming that ancient English law gives them the power to do so. In recent days, at least a dozen videos have appeared online showing
attempts to âserveâ papers on staff. In one case, a centre manager is heard
telling an activist that his papers are bogus, before showing him the door. The activists are using âsovereign citizenâ theory âa bogus legal concept which we recently investigated. The groups believe they can opt out of laws they donât like and become
âcommon law constablesâ to enforce their beliefs.Neither of these concepts has any
legal force. The people invading vaccine centres cite a crime
reference number (CRN) as âproofâ that crimes are being committed. One group left
a dossier at a London police station claiming the vaccine rollout is a criminal
enterprise. But the Metropolitan Police say theyhave not opened an investigation into the claims,external, and the CRN merely shows that an allegation has been received
and recorded. A CRN is no proof that a crime has been committed, police say. Downing Street says it is not investigating allegations that MPs calling for Boris Johnson's resignation have been blackmailed by government whips. Labour called for an inquiry after senior Tory MP William Wragg said threats that would ""seem to constitute blackmail"" had been made to colleagues. No 10 says it has not seen any proof of such behaviour. A spokesman says they would look ""carefully"" at any evidence presented to them but theywere not seeking it. Separately, a group of MPs known as the ""pork pie plotters"" has been meeting regularly to discuss whether to oust Johnson over revelations he attended a drinks party during lockdown. They met on Thursday to discuss going public with their own complaints of intimidation by the whips - the MPs in charge of party discipline. The Times reports,externalthey are considering releasing text messages and a secret recording of a ""heated"" conversation with the chief whip to support their claims. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Jakub Morawiecki has said the government will prepare more Covid hospital beds as it faces a surge in cases. The Polish government also announced that it will shorten Covid-19 isolation to seven days and will introduce free coronavirus tests in pharmacies across the country. As we reported earlier, Poland registered its highest number of daily infections on Friday - 36,665 new cases. This is an 128% increase from the previous week. Poland's health minister, Adam Niedzielski, warned that Poland could see around 140,000 daily Covid cases in a worst case scenario. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng says people should return to the office, as the UK needs to ""get back to some degree of normality"". On Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced an end to Plan B measures. The government isno longer asking people to work from homeand masks will no longer compulsory in public settings from 27 January. Kwarteng told LBC radio that there are ""benefits from working with colleagues, being able to interact directly with them"". He added that Covid-19 is ""turning from a pandemic into an endemic"" and ""it's something we have to live with"". Welsh Secretary Simon Hart has labelled attacks on the UK government and PM Boris Johnson by the first minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, ""an uncalled for and opportunistic insult towards medical advisers and the public"". ""It's thanks to the decisions of UK (& Welsh) Gov, scientists, families & businesses that the UK is ahead of the world in its response to Covid,"" Mr Hart wrote in a tweet. Speaking earlier at a press briefing,external, Mr Drakeford said the UK government was ""simply not functioning"" because it was occupied by the need to deflect attention from press stories about parties held at Downing Street during lockdown. ""If anybody believes that their announcements this week on coronavirus were the result of a careful consideration of the science, or because they had a well worked out plan for what they were doing, I think that would be a very optimistic view indeed,"" the first minister said. Welsh Conservatives have claimed Wales has the worst Covid mortality rate in the UK and called for a Wales-specific Covid inquiry. Allow Twitter content?

The ""day is coming"" when the use of face masks in Scotland's schools will end, a top government adviser has said. The Scottish government's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, said he believed the requirement to wear masks in schools will be withdrawn soon, but he did not know when. In England, the requirement for face masks to be worn in secondary school classrooms has been scrapped. Prof Leitch also said science had now been able to ""de-fang"" Covid, and the worst was likely behind the country. However, he warned future restrictions could still be needed. Read more.  London's major incident status is being removed, Mayor Sadiq Khan has announced. But the city will remain on high alert due to the significant threat Covid-19 and the Omicron variant still pose in the capital, he says. The major incident was declared on 18 December due to the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, a significant rise in patients in London hospitals and the impact on staff absences in frontline services. It's been ended following the gradual reduction in the number of Covid cases, manageable hospital numbers and an improvement in staff absences,Khan says.,external He is calling on the government to rethink their Covid plans and keep legislation in place to make face coverings mandatory on public transport. ""They still have a huge role to play in keeping our city open and our friends, family and communities protected,"" he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

others were unable to use the tickets,the Financial Times reports,external. Horta-OsÃ³rio went to the two
big sporting events in July, at a time when the UK's Covid restrictions
required him to be in quarantine. The England-Italy Wembley
final was later declared a Covid super-spreader event, with more than 2,000
people said to have attended while ""likely to be infectious"". Alistair ColemanBBC Monitoring Groups of anti-vaccine activists are attempting to close
down a number of Covid-19 vaccination centres across the UK, falsely
claiming that ancient English law gives them the power to do so. In recent days, at least a dozen videos have appeared online showing
attempts to âserveâ papers on staff. In one case, a centre manager is heard
telling an activist that his papers are bogus, before showing him the door. The activists are using âsovereign citizenâ theory âa bogus legal concept which we recently investigated. The groups believe they can opt out of laws they donât like and become
âcommon law constablesâ to enforce their beliefs.Neither of these concepts has any
legal force. The people invading vaccine centres cite a crime
reference number (CRN) as âproofâ that crimes are being committed. One group left
a dossier at a London police station claiming the vaccine rollout is a criminal
enterprise. But the Metropolitan Police say theyhave not opened an investigation into the claims,external, and the CRN merely shows that an allegation has been received
and recorded. A CRN is no proof that a crime has been committed, police say. Downing Street says it is not investigating allegations that MPs calling for Boris Johnson's resignation have been blackmailed by government whips. Labour called for an inquiry after senior Tory MP William Wragg said threats that would ""seem to constitute blackmail"" had been made to colleagues. No 10 says it has not seen any proof of such behaviour. A spokesman says they would look ""carefully"" at any evidence presented to them but theywere not seeking it. Separately, a group of MPs known as the ""pork pie plotters"" has been meeting regularly to discuss whether to oust Johnson over revelations he attended a drinks party during lockdown. They met on Thursday to discuss going public with their own complaints of intimidation by the whips - the MPs in charge of party discipline. The Times reports,externalthey are considering releasing text messages and a secret recording of a ""heated"" conversation with the chief whip to support their claims. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Jakub Morawiecki has said the government will prepare more Covid hospital beds as it faces a surge in cases. The Polish government also announced that it will shorten Covid-19 isolation to seven days and will introduce free coronavirus tests in pharmacies across the country. As we reported earlier, Poland registered its highest number of daily infections on Friday - 36,665 new cases. This is an 128% increase from the previous week. Poland's health minister, Adam Niedzielski, warned that Poland could see around 140,000 daily Covid cases in a worst case scenario. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng says people should return to the office, as the UK needs to ""get back to some degree of normality"". On Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced an end to Plan B measures. The government isno longer asking people to work from homeand masks will no longer compulsory in public settings from 27 January. Kwarteng told LBC radio that there are ""benefits from working with colleagues, being able to interact directly with them"". He added that Covid-19 is ""turning from a pandemic into an endemic"" and ""it's something we have to live with"". Welsh Secretary Simon Hart has labelled attacks on the UK government and PM Boris Johnson by the first minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, ""an uncalled for and opportunistic insult towards medical advisers and the public"". ""It's thanks to the decisions of UK (& Welsh) Gov, scientists, families & businesses that the UK is ahead of the world in its response to Covid,"" Mr Hart wrote in a tweet. Speaking earlier at a press briefing,external, Mr Drakeford said the UK government was ""simply not functioning"" because it was occupied by the need to deflect attention from press stories about parties held at Downing Street during lockdown. ""If anybody believes that their announcements this week on coronavirus were the result of a careful consideration of the science, or because they had a well worked out plan for what they were doing, I think that would be a very optimistic view indeed,"" the first minister said. Welsh Conservatives have claimed Wales has the worst Covid mortality rate in the UK and called for a Wales-specific Covid inquiry. Allow Twitter content?

The ""day is coming"" when the use of face masks in Scotland's schools will end, a top government adviser has said. The Scottish government's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, said he believed the requirement to wear masks in schools will be withdrawn soon, but he did not know when. In England, the requirement for face masks to be worn in secondary school classrooms has been scrapped. Prof Leitch also said science had now been able to ""de-fang"" Covid, and the worst was likely behind the country. However, he warned future restrictions could still be needed. Read more.  London's major incident status is being removed, Mayor Sadiq Khan has announced. But the city will remain on high alert due to the significant threat Covid-19 and the Omicron variant still pose in the capital, he says. The major incident was declared on 18 December due to the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, a significant rise in patients in London hospitals and the impact on staff absences in frontline services. It's been ended following the gradual reduction in the number of Covid cases, manageable hospital numbers and an improvement in staff absences,Khan says.,external He is calling on the government to rethink their Covid plans and keep legislation in place to make face coverings mandatory on public transport.

"False banana offers hope for warming worldThe banana-like crop has the potential to feed more than 100 million people, according to research.","Fruit of the banana (left) and enset (right) Scientists say the plant enset, an Ethiopian staple, could be a new superfood and a lifesaver in the face of climate change. The banana-like crop has the potential to feed more than 100 million people in a warming world, according to a new study. The plant is almost unknown outside of Ethiopia, where it is used to make porridge and bread. Research suggests the crop can be grown over a much larger range in Africa. ""This is a crop that can play a really important role in addressing food security and sustainable development,"" said Dr Wendawek Abebe of Hawassa University in Awasa, Ethiopia. Enset or ""false banana"" is a close relative of the banana, but is consumed only in one part of Ethiopia. The banana-like fruit of the plant is inedible, but the starchy stems and roots can be fermented and used to make porridge and bread. The plant is a close relative of the banana and looks similar to its 'cousin' Enset is a staple in Ethiopia, where around 20 million people rely on it for food, but elsewhere it has not been cultivated, although wild relatives - which are not considered edible - grow as far south as South Africa, suggesting the plant can tolerate a much wider range. Using agricultural surveys and modelling work, scientists predicted the potential range of enset over the next four decades. They found the crop could potentially feed more than 100 million people and boost food security in Ethiopia and other African countries, including Kenya, Uganda and Rwanda. Study researcher Dr James Borrell, of the Royal Botanic Gardens, Kew, said planting enset as a buffer crop for lean times could help boost food security. ""It's got some really unusual traits that make it absolutely unique as a crop,"" he said. ""You plant it at any time, you harvest it at any time and it's perennial. That's why they call it the tree against hunger."" Ethiopia is a major centre of crop domestication in Africa, home to coffee and many other crops. Enset reaches 10 metres (39 feet) tall Climate change is predicted to seriously affect yields and distribution of staple food crops across Africa and beyond. There is growing interest in seeking new plants to feed the world, given our reliance on a few staple crops. Nearly half of all the calories we eat come from three species - rice, wheat and maize. ""We need to diversify the plants we use globally as a species because all our eggs are in a very small basket at the moment,"" said Dr Borrell.

Electric car battery plant gets millions in fundingBritishvolt says the money unlocks huge private investment for a project that will create thousands of jobs.BusinessComments,"Artist impression of the Britishvolt factory, being built in Northumberland A firm planning mass production of electric car batteries in the UK has secured government funding for its proposed factory in Northumberland. Britishvolt announced plans for the so-called gigafactory in Cambois two years ago, saying it would create 3,000 jobs. The BBC understands the government has committed about Â£100m through its Automotive Transformation Fund. Britishvolt also announced backing from investors Tritax and Abrdn, that should unlock about Â£1.7bn in private funding. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng described the support as ""reindustrialisation"". He told the BBC's Today programme that the ""huge investment"" would give people the ""opportunity to have highly-paid, well-paid, high-skilled jobs"". ""We're bringing industry, we're bringing manufacturing to an area that has been under invested in frankly and we're bringing thousands of jobs,"" he said. ""Well paid jobs, which represent a huge economic opportunity for people in this area. This is exactly what levelling up looks like. "" The government wants the UK to become a major force in the fast-growing market for electric cars. But if it wants manufacturers to build them here, then having gigafactories in the UK as well is vital. Not only are battery packs big and heavy, making local production desirable, they also make up a large proportion of the value of an electric car. And under the Brexit deal, cars made in the UK and sold in Europe will soon have to contain a significant amount of UK or European parts. Put simply: If batteries aren't made here, the chances are carmakers won't set up shop here either. Experts say the Britishvolt plant will have to be the first of many. The future of the entire UK car industry depends on it. The sale in the UK of new petrol and diesel cars will be banned by 2030, with manufacturers switching to making electric vehicles and requiring huge battery production. The government has set aside more than Â£800m to attract battery investment to the UK. Mr Kwarteng said Britishvolt would help put the UK at the front ""in this global race between countries to secure vital battery production"". At full capacity, expected to be achieved by the end of the decade, the factory will produce enough battery cells for more than 300,000 electric vehicle battery packs per year. 'Game changer' electric car battery plant approved The gigafactory is being built on the site of the former Blyth Power Station. In addition to the 3,000 people at the site, Britishvolt estimates at least another 5,000 jobs will be created in the supply chain. Peter Rolton, Britishvolt's executive chairman, told the BBC's Today programme that he would like all of the new jobs at the plant to go to people living in the area, and said the company was setting up a training centre in nearby Ashington. ""Our policy is going to be to try and not to say no to anybody,"" he added. Mr Rolton said the first batteries ready for use would roll off the production line in 2024. He said: ""This announcement is a major step in putting the UK at the forefront of the global energy transition, unlocking huge private sector investment that will develop the technology and skills required for Britain to play its part in the next industrial revolution. ""This is a truly historic day and marks the start of a truly exciting move towards a low carbon future."" Last year, Nissan's partner, China's Envision AESC, announced it would build an electric battery plant to supply an expansion of electric vehicle production at the Japanese carmaker's plant in Sunderland.

Omicron spread led shoppers to desert High Street,"UK retail sales sank 3.7% in December from the month before as the spread of Omicron deterred shoppers from visiting the High Street. Data from the Office for National Statistics,externalalso showed a 7.1% fall in clothing and other non-food sales. However, last month's figures followed a strong November amid reports there would be some shortages in the run-up to Christmas. And while food sales fell by 1%, volumes were above pre-pandemic levels. ""After strong pre-Christmas trading in November, retail sales fell across the board in December, with feedback from retailers suggesting Omicron impacted on footfall,"" said Office for National Statistics (ONS) deputy director for surveys and economic indicators Heather Bovill. ""As Plan B restrictions in England meant more people working from home, there was a notable fall for fuel sales. ""However, despite the fall in December, retail sales are still stronger than before the pandemic, with over a quarter of sales now made online."" Fuel volumes fell by 4.7% in December on the previous month as more people worked from home, and were 6.6% below their pre-pandemic levels in February 2020. Superdry warns of price rises and ends shop discounts Primark to cut 400 store management jobs Christmas sales soar for Marks & Spencer and Tesco Gavin Peck, chief executive of retailer The Works, told the BBC there were definite signs that consumers did their Christmas shopping earlier than usual last year. Mr Peck, whose firm on Friday reported a strong rise in sales, said it was noticeable that some shoppers were starting festive purchases as early as September. As the UK economy emerged from lockdown last year retail sales recovered quickly from their 2020 pandemic slump. But analysts say that a combination of fast-rising inflation led by surging energy prices, the prospect of higher interest rates, and planned tax rises in April may dent the appetite of consumers to keep on spending in 2022. The restaurant chain saw a sharp fall in customers in December. Bethany Beckett, economist at Capital Economics, said December's fall was much bigger than expected and could drag UK growth figures lower. However, she said: ""With encouraging signs that the Omicron outbreak may have turned a corner and the government's Plan B restrictions due to be lifted next week, retail sales may recoup a bit of this fall in January and probably all of it in February and March. ""That said, with the UK's cost of living crisis looming, we expect a weakening in the consumer recovery to dampen retail sales further ahead."" Ms Beckett said that, despite weaker economic data, the Bank of England will remain focused on accelerating inflation, and she still expects interest rates to be raised to 0.50% in early February. On Friday, The Restaurant Group, whose operations include Wagamama, Frankie & Benny's, and food kiosks, said that despite the lifting of Plan B restrictions ""consumer confidence may take longer to recover"". The company's sales figures,externalunderlined the impact of December's Covid restrictions on trading. At Wagamama, sales in October and November were up 11% and 8% respectively on the same months in 2019, before the pandemic hit, as people returned to eating out in larger numbers. But in December, Wagamama sales were just 1% up on 2019, and there were even sharper falls at Restaurant Group's other divisions.

Austrian lawmakers back mandatory vaccination bill,"Health Minister Wolfgang Mueckstein said the mandate was how the country would ""escape the cycle of opening and closing, of lockdowns"" Austria has moved closer to introducing a compulsory vaccination order after parliament's lower house voted in favour of new government proposals. The law, which is due to come into effect on 1 February, would make Austria the first European country to introduce a mandatory jab. From mid-March the law will see adults unvaccinated against Covid-19 subjected to fines of up to â¬3,600 (Â£2,994). So far, 72% of Austrians have been fully vaccinated against the virus. The bill must now pass the upper house and be signed into law by President Alexander Van der Bellen, steps largely expected to be formalities. The vaccine order is expected to remain in force until January 2024, with the government investing â¬1.4bn in measures designed to encourage unvaccinated people to come forward for the jab. Addressing lawmakers on Thursday afternoon, Health Minister Wolfgang Mueckstein called the measure a ""big, and, for the first time, also lasting step"" in Austria's fight against the pandemic. Chancellor Karl Nehammer told reporters ahead of the vote that vaccines were ""an opportunity for our society to achieve lasting and continuous freedom, because the virus cannot restrict us any further"". A majority of MPs, including those from Mr Nehammer's governing centre-right coalition and the three main opposition parties, backed the bill, by 137 votes to 33. The far-right Freedom Party, which has courted the votes of Austria's substantial anti-vaccine minority, has taken a stand against the bill. Its leader, Herbert Kickl, said the mandate ""paves the way to totalitarianism in Austria"" and vowed he would continue to refuse vaccination in defiance of the new law. Some Austrian MPs have accused Freedom Party leader Herbert Kickl of opportunistically opposing the mandate Since authorities announced they intended to introduce the mandate in November the capital, Vienna,has seen regular protests, with some numbering over 40,000 people. The demonstrations have attracted a coalition of anti-vaccine campaigners and far-right extremists, and authorities have warned that they have been radicalising in recent weeks, with new ""protective zones"" declared around healthcare facilities and vaccination centres to protect workers. Similar vaccine mandates are being introduced in several other countries, including in Greece, where jabs are now obligatory for everyone aged 60. In neighbouring Germany, the new government led by Chancellor Olaf Scholz has said it will introduce a vaccination bill in the Bundestag in March. Mandatory vaccinations: Three reasons for and against Watch: Ros Atkins onâ¦ Compulsory Covid vaccinations Why mandatory vaccination is nothing new Austria's move comes as some European countries begin to tenuously loosen restrictions introduced to tackle the highly infectious Omicron variant. In the UK,Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced the end of mandatory face coverings in public places and Covid passportson 26 January. Mr Johnson also suggested that the government intended to end the legal requirement for people who tested positive for Covid to self-isolate - and replace it with advice and guidance at the end of March. The Irish government also looks set to end a raft of coronavirus restrictions introduced over the Christmas period, including rules mandating the closure of hospitality settings by 20:00. And in the Netherlands 30 mayors, including Femke Halsema in Amsterdam, have urged Prime Minister Mark Rutte to curb tough restrictions amid a fall in hospitalisations and deaths.

Thanks for following today's live page. Your writers were Jen Meierhans, Victoria Lindrea, Malu Cursino and Nathan
Williams. The page was edited by Alex Therrien, Becky Morton and Lauren Turner. From all the team, have a good evening. We're coming to the end of our live coverage for the day - here's
a reminder of the key Covid stories we've been covering: Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online UK experts are keeping an eye on a variant of Omicron called BA.2. There have been 426 cases confirmed by whole genome sequencing in England so far - many in London or the South East - with the earliest logged on 6 December. That's an extremely tiny proportion of all the Omicron cases that have been occurring around the UK this winter though. The bulk of this current wave has been ""regular"" BA.1 Omicron. Despite cropping up in the news today, the BA.2 sub-lineage is not new - it has been
around in the world for a while, just like regular Omicron. Experts are
not very worried about it, but want to monitor what it is doing. In Denmark it appears to be gaining ground over BA.1. Importantly, all the evidence so far suggests that booster jabs are doing a great job against all variants of Covid in terms of preventing serious illness.  Back to the government's daily coronavirus data, let's take a look what the graphs show us. So far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - 91% of over-12s. More than 48 million - 84% of over-12s - have had both doses. While uptake of first and second doses dropped off, there had been a steep rise in people having boosters - but, booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. The latest UK R estimate from the government's scientific advisory group Sage,is between 0.7 and 0.9,external, that's up slightly from the week before. It means that, on average, every 10 people with Covid will infect between seven and nine others. But in Wales the R number is higher -here's more info. There have been protests against the new vaccine pass In
France, a new Covid pass - that will effectively ban the unvaccinated from public
life - has been approved by the country's Constitutional Council. From
24 January, people over 16 will have to show a certificate of vaccination to gain
access to a host of public venues. The
new law removes the option of showing a negative Covid test to enter places
like bars and restaurants. The
council ruled that the pass should not be required for political meetings, and should
expire as soon as it is no longer necessary. French President Emmanuel Macron caused uproar when he told Le Parisien newspaper at the beginning of
Januaryhe really wanted to ""piss off"" the unjabbed, by
""limiting as much as possible their access to activities in social
life"". Boris
Johnson is calling on teachers who are still insisting that masks should be
worn in class to follow the latest guidance. Secondary
school children in England areno longer required to have face coverings in classrooms, as the government rolls back Plan B restrictions. A
spokesman for the PM says children have been hit hard by the disruption of the
pandemic and it is ""vital that children are receiving
face-to-face education"". From 27 January the advice for masks to be worn in communal areas will also be dropped. Mary Bousted, of teaching union NEU, says schools that keep face
coverings are doing so ""following a risk assessment"". She
says it's a ""sensible precaution"" and it's ""bizarre"" that the government should seek to ""micromanage"". Andy Byers, a head teacher in County Durham,wrote to parents and students asking them to continue to wear face coverings, with Covid rates remaining high in the North East. The daily coronavirus data shows the total number of people who tested positive in the last seven days is 646,835.That's a decrease of 27% from the previous week. The seven-day average for deaths is 1,878 which is up 0.5%. The seven-day average for people admitted to hospital with Covid is 14,213 - down 9.9% on the week before. The UK has given a total of 137,022,678 coronavirus vaccinations, according to the government's daily figures. That's 52,186,398 first doses, 48,082,636 second doses and 36,753,644 third or booster doses. The UK has recorded a further 95,787 coronavirus cases, according to the government'sdaily coronavirus data,external. There were also 288 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test. On Thursday 107,364 cases and 330 deaths were reported. Blood donations kept Georgina (right) alive, when she was a newborn baby The Welsh Blood Service says donations are down because of Covid. Interim director Alan Prosser said winter was always challenging, without the added pressures of a pandemic. ""We've had to find larger venues because of social distancing, so we moved away from smaller community donation centres,"" he explains. In addition, the use of community donation vehicles in Wales was suspended because of Covid restrictions. Last month Scotland hadfewer registered blood donors than at any other point this century, and before Christmasthe Republic of Ireland was importing blood from England. Meanwhile England's hospitals got through the pandemic withthe smallest pool of donors in the 21st Century,external. Read the full story. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst It is now just two weeks until the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and Chinaâs capital city continues to try to combat an outbreak of Covid-19 under its âzero-Covid strategyâ. Officials told a press conference today that Beijing has now confirmed 23 cases of Covid-19 since 15 January. These are spread across four districts in the city, and there have been cases of both the Delta and the Omicron variant. Beijingâs deputy police chief, Pan Xuhong, told the media about some of the Covid-19 violations that police officers have had to deal with over the last week. He mentioned the case of a 51-year-old man âjumping out of a windowâ in the cityâs Changping District, in order to break quarantine. He said the man, surnamed Xie, has now been detained. He also spoke of a 46-year-old wholesaler âreplacing import labels with domestic labelsâ after the authorities warned that import goods could pose a Covid-19 risk. Xuhong said the man is now being investigated. Read more. ONS analysis suggests UK daily Covid cases in the week after Christmas were almost three times higher than the numbers shown on the government dashboard - why is this? It's because the official numbers are affected by how many people are coming forward for tests, have chosen to report their test results, or who are taking a test because they know they have coronavirus symptoms. By contrast, the ONS figures are based on analysis of nose and throat swabs taken from a representative sample of more than 150,000 people in private households. The same people are sampled every week, regardless of whether they know they have Covid-19 or have reported a positive result. The ONS then produces estimates of the likely number of new cases of coronavirus across the country. New cases of Covid-19 in the UK averaged nearly half a million a day during the week after Christmas, almost three times the official figures, new analysis suggests. An average of 173,400 new cases of coronavirus per day were recorded from 26 December to 1 January, according to the government's Covid-19 dashboard. But the true number of cases was likely to be nearer 479,100 a day, according to estimates by the Office for National Statistics. Health agencies are urging caution about interpreting the regular case numbers published each day for the UK, following changes in rules about testing. The sharp difference in totals reflects just how many new cases of Covid-19 are being missed in the dashboard figures, which count only those people who have reported themselves as having tested positive for the virus. AntÃ³nio Horta-OsÃ³rio quit as
boss of banking giant Credit Suisse for
breaking Covid rules by going to the Wimbledon tennis finals last summer. Now it's emergedhe also went to the Euros football final at Wembleyâ on the same day. Credit Suisse had organised
corporate hospitality at the events, but Horta-OsÃ³rio took family to both after
others were unable to use the tickets,the Financial Times reports,external. Horta-OsÃ³rio went to the two
big sporting events in July, at a time when the UK's Covid restrictions
required him to be in quarantine. The England-Italy Wembley
final was later declared a Covid super-spreader event, with more than 2,000
people said to have attended while ""likely to be infectious"". Alistair ColemanBBC Monitoring Groups of anti-vaccine activists are attempting to close
down a number of Covid-19 vaccination centres across the UK, falsely
claiming that ancient English law gives them the power to do so. In recent days, at least a dozen videos have appeared online showing
attempts to âserveâ papers on staff. In one case, a centre manager is heard
telling an activist that his papers are bogus, before showing him the door. The activists are using âsovereign citizenâ theory âa bogus legal concept which we recently investigated. The groups believe they can opt out of laws they donât like and become
âcommon law constablesâ to enforce their beliefs.Neither of these concepts has any
legal force. The people invading vaccine centres cite a crime
reference number (CRN) as âproofâ that crimes are being committed. One group left
a dossier at a London police station claiming the vaccine rollout is a criminal
enterprise. But the Metropolitan Police say theyhave not opened an investigation into the claims,external, and the CRN merely shows that an allegation has been received
and recorded. A CRN is no proof that a crime has been committed, police say. Downing Street says it is not investigating allegations that MPs calling for Boris Johnson's resignation have been blackmailed by government whips. Labour called for an inquiry after senior Tory MP William Wragg said threats that would ""seem to constitute blackmail"" had been made to colleagues. No 10 says it has not seen any proof of such behaviour. A spokesman says they would look ""carefully"" at any evidence presented to them but theywere not seeking it. Separately, a group of MPs known as the ""pork pie plotters"" has been meeting regularly to discuss whether to oust Johnson over revelations he attended a drinks party during lockdown. They met on Thursday to discuss going public with their own complaints of intimidation by the whips - the MPs in charge of party discipline. The Times reports,externalthey are considering releasing text messages and a secret recording of a ""heated"" conversation with the chief whip to support their claims. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Jakub Morawiecki has said the government will prepare more Covid hospital beds as it faces a surge in cases. The Polish government also announced that it will shorten Covid-19 isolation to seven days and will introduce free coronavirus tests in pharmacies across the country. As we reported earlier, Poland registered its highest number of daily infections on Friday - 36,665 new cases. This is an 128% increase from the previous week. Poland's health minister, Adam Niedzielski, warned that Poland could see around 140,000 daily Covid cases in a worst case scenario. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng says people should return to the office, as the UK needs to ""get back to some degree of normality"". On Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced an end to Plan B measures. The government isno longer asking people to work from homeand masks will no longer compulsory in public settings from 27 January. Kwarteng told LBC radio that there are ""benefits from working with colleagues, being able to interact directly with them"". He added that Covid-19 is ""turning from a pandemic into an endemic"" and ""it's something we have to live with"". Welsh Secretary Simon Hart has labelled attacks on the UK government and PM Boris Johnson by the first minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, ""an uncalled for and opportunistic insult towards medical advisers and the public"". ""It's thanks to the decisions of UK (& Welsh) Gov, scientists, families & businesses that the UK is ahead of the world in its response to Covid,"" Mr Hart wrote in a tweet. Speaking earlier at a press briefing,external, Mr Drakeford said the UK government was ""simply not functioning"" because it was occupied by the need to deflect attention from press stories about parties held at Downing Street during lockdown. ""If anybody believes that their announcements this week on coronavirus were the result of a careful consideration of the science, or because they had a well worked out plan for what they were doing, I think that would be a very optimistic view indeed,"" the first minister said. Welsh Conservatives have claimed Wales has the worst Covid mortality rate in the UK and called for a Wales-specific Covid inquiry. Allow Twitter content?

The ""day is coming"" when the use of face masks in Scotland's schools will end, a top government adviser has said. The Scottish government's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, said he believed the requirement to wear masks in schools will be withdrawn soon, but he did not know when. In England, the requirement for face masks to be worn in secondary school classrooms has been scrapped. Prof Leitch also said science had now been able to ""de-fang"" Covid, and the worst was likely behind the country. However, he warned future restrictions could still be needed. Read more.  London's major incident status is being removed, Mayor Sadiq Khan has announced. But the city will remain on high alert due to the significant threat Covid-19 and the Omicron variant still pose in the capital, he says. The major incident was declared on 18 December due to the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, a significant rise in patients in London hospitals and the impact on staff absences in frontline services. It's been ended following the gradual reduction in the number of Covid cases, manageable hospital numbers and an improvement in staff absences,Khan says.,external He is calling on the government to rethink their Covid plans and keep legislation in place to make face coverings mandatory on public transport. ""They still have a huge role to play in keeping our city open and our friends, family and communities protected,"" he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

Fans to return to Welsh stadiums as Covid rules easeRestrictions brought in to tackle Omicron meant fans were barred from Welsh stadiums from 26 December.Wales politics,"Fans will be able to return to watch when Wales kicks-off its Six Nations in February More restrictions to people's daily lives have been eased in Wales as Omicron cases continue to decline. Pubs and restaurants in Wales can now operate outdoors without the rule of six or social distancing. All limits on sports events have been scrapped meaning thousands of fans are set to return to watch fixtures across the country. First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""We have passed the peak and the situation has improved significantly."" It is the second part of a three-week roadmap to scrap restrictions imposed because of the Omicron variant. As it happened: Drakeford slams PM as rules ease UK ministers 'distracting people from awful mess' What are the Covid rules in Wales? From a peak of more than 2,300 cases per 100,000 people in Wales, the rate has dipped below 500 on Friday. The latest infection survey from the Office for National Statistics also estimates a fall in the number of people in Wales with Covid - affecting one in 25 of the population. The number of people in hospital and in intensive care with Covid are also both declining. The first minister said: ""Omicron was another unpleasant twist to this long-running pandemic."" Mr Drakeford said decisions to lift rules in England are being to made to deflect from the ""dire difficulties the Prime Minister has created for himself"" ""We have weathered this storm together in Wales by following the rules and these measures that have kept us safe for nearly two years,"" added Mr Drakeford. ""Sadly the pandemic is not over and coronavirus is still with us but we can look forward to the future with renewed hope and with better and brighter days ahead of us."" He previously laid out a roadmap for which restrictions will be eased and when. From 15 January, numbers allowed to attend an outdoor event rose from 50 to 500 From 21 January, all limits for outdoor activities have been scrapped with crowds able to return to sporting events. On 28 January, Wales will move to alert level zero. This means nightclubs can reopen and the rule of six will be scrapped in pubs and restaurants, although Covid passes will still be required for large events, plus cinemas, nightclubs and theatres From 10 February, a three-week review cycle returns as the country is at alert level zero But the Welsh Conservatives said Mr Drakeford should set a date for all Covid-related laws - including mask wearing and self-isolation rules - to be lifted. Plaid Cymru said the Welsh government needed to set out what else it will do to help the hospitality sector. Anyone over 18 will still have to show aCovid passto go to larger outdoor event, so they can show they are either fully vaccinated or have had a negative lateral flow test in the past 24 hours. The passes, which are being scrapped in England, will also still be required in cinemas and theatres until at least the next review on 10 February. The rule of six will be lifted for pubs and restaurants outdoors from Friday Before Mr Drakeford set outhis plans to phase out the post-Christmas rules, he had faced growing pressure to ease sporting restrictions, including from the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU), whichthreatened to move Wales' Six Nations home games to England. He toldRadio Wales Breakfast: ""I don't think anybody watching objectively what is happening in England could imagine that their decisions have been made by a careful attention to public health advice and some long-term plan. ""Their announcements are entirely down to the astonishing mess they find themselves in and an effort to create headlines that will distract the public's attention from the prime minister's failings. ""Covid passes encourage people to get out and about, using venues where they know everyone else has taken precautions."" Christmas Covid rules 'cost pubs Â£16,000 each' How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? The changes mean sports fans can return to Welsh stadiums from Saturday, with Swansea City's home game against Preston North End among the first to welcome back supporters. Season ticket holder Simon Williams said: ""It's been strange when you could do a 500 mile roundtrip to go watch us away but you couldn't go 10 minutes down the road to watch at us at home."" While Lorraine Dyer said her ""football mad"" grandsons were excited to return to the Swansea.com stadium. Swansea City season ticket holder Simon Williams said: ""Football's not the same without fans in the stadium"" Calum Darling, of Club One47 in Llandudno, has said his nightclub has lost up to 95% of its trade since restrictions had come into force. ""We've always got the most restrictions imposed on us as opposed to England, Scotland, Northern Ireland,"" he said. ""It just doesn't make sense that we're always five steps behind. There's just no logic to the reasoning behind it."" Alert level zero is the lowest level of measures, where all businesses are allowed to reopen without two-metre social distancing rules in place. If all goes to plan, the rule of six will not apply in pubs, restaurants, cinemas and theatres from 28 January. However, face masks will still be required in most indoor public places,unlike England where they will not be compulsory from Thursday. Self-isolation rules also remain in force, and work from home guidance will remain advice but will not be law. Wales,along with Scotland and Northern Ireland, brought in new Covid restrictions over Christmas because of a rapid rise in cases driven by the Omicron variant. The decision to continue easing the rules comes as Wales sees the ""fastest rate of decline"" in case numbers and the lowest rate in the UK, according to Mr Drakeford. It is down 61% in a week to 490.8 cases per 100,000, the lowest since 9 December. The ONS infection survey estimates numbers infected in Wales have fallen 34% over the week, with 3.69% of the population having Covid in the week ending 15 January. The number of patients with Covid in hospital is at an average of 722, an 16% fall on last week, while numbers in critical care are the lowest since 11 August. However, Mr Drakeford added: ""We are not out of the woods yet. There are still more than 1,000 people in hospital with Covid and that is putting additional pressure on the NHS."" But the former head of Public Health Wales' communicable disease surveillance centre said the restrictions had been unnecessary and ""should have been lifted three weeks ago"". Dr Roland Salmon said: ""I've been a long time sceptic of these long-term measures such as lockdown. ""They've contributed very little while, in contrast, the vaccination programme has contributed a great deal."" Chester are an English club, insists chairman after Covid 'rule break' Wales Covid rules relaxed as cases drop rapidly Wales could be turning corner on Covid says minister The UK government said it intended to end the legal requirement for people who test positive for Covid to self-isolate in England - and replace it with advice and guidance.

LiveLiveOmicron rules relaxed in Wales and Northern Ireland6 minutes ago,"The UK has recorded a further 95,787 coronavirus cases and 288 deaths, according to the latest daily figures Wales has passed the peak of the Omicron wave, the first minister says, in a briefing on rule changes in the country Measures to slow the spread of Omicron are being eased in Wales today, with thousands of fans set to return to sporting stadiums Pubs and restaurants will also be able to operate outdoors without the rule of six or social distancing But First Minister Mark Drakeford warns the country is ""by no means out of the woods"", with hospital numbers still high Earlier, he accused the UK government of using Covid announcements ""to distract people's attention from the awful mess"" in Westminster New Covid cases in the UK averaged nearly half a million a day in the week after Christmas, ONS analysis suggests This was almost three times greater than the case numbers in the government's daily coronavirus figures Northern Ireland is bringing in new rules on shorter self-isolation periods and table service in pubs and restaurants Meanwhile Adele has postponed her Las Vegas residency 24 hours before it was due to start, blaming Covid for delaying preparations On Thursday, the UK reported 107,364 new cases and 330 deaths within 28 days of a positive test Edited by Alex Therrien We're ending our live coverage of todayâs Covid developments. Thanks for following today's live page. Your writers were Jen Meierhans, Victoria Lindrea, Malu Cursino and Nathan
Williams. The page was edited by Alex Therrien, Becky Morton and Lauren Turner. From all the team, have a good evening. We're coming to the end of our live coverage for the day - here's
a reminder of the key Covid stories we've been covering: Michelle RobertsHealth editor, BBC News online UK experts are keeping an eye on a variant of Omicron called BA.2. There have been 426 cases confirmed by whole genome sequencing in England so far - many in London or the South East - with the earliest logged on 6 December. That's an extremely tiny proportion of all the Omicron cases that have been occurring around the UK this winter though. The bulk of this current wave has been ""regular"" BA.1 Omicron. Despite cropping up in the news today, the BA.2 sub-lineage is not new - it has been
around in the world for a while, just like regular Omicron. Experts are
not very worried about it, but want to monitor what it is doing. In Denmark it appears to be gaining ground over BA.1. Importantly, all the evidence so far suggests that booster jabs are doing a great job against all variants of Covid in terms of preventing serious illness.  Back to the government's daily coronavirus data, let's take a look what the graphs show us. So far, more than 52 million people have had a first vaccine dose - 91% of over-12s. More than 48 million - 84% of over-12s - have had both doses. While uptake of first and second doses dropped off, there had been a steep rise in people having boosters - but, booster numbers dipped over the Christmas holiday period and remain low. The latest UK R estimate from the government's scientific advisory group Sage,is between 0.7 and 0.9,external, that's up slightly from the week before. It means that, on average, every 10 people with Covid will infect between seven and nine others. But in Wales the R number is higher -here's more info. There have been protests against the new vaccine pass In
France, a new Covid pass - that will effectively ban the unvaccinated from public
life - has been approved by the country's Constitutional Council. From
24 January, people over 16 will have to show a certificate of vaccination to gain
access to a host of public venues. The
new law removes the option of showing a negative Covid test to enter places
like bars and restaurants. The
council ruled that the pass should not be required for political meetings, and should
expire as soon as it is no longer necessary. French President Emmanuel Macron caused uproar when he told Le Parisien newspaper at the beginning of
Januaryhe really wanted to ""piss off"" the unjabbed, by
""limiting as much as possible their access to activities in social
life"". Boris
Johnson is calling on teachers who are still insisting that masks should be
worn in class to follow the latest guidance. Secondary
school children in England areno longer required to have face coverings in classrooms, as the government rolls back Plan B restrictions. A
spokesman for the PM says children have been hit hard by the disruption of the
pandemic and it is ""vital that children are receiving
face-to-face education"". From 27 January the advice for masks to be worn in communal areas will also be dropped. Mary Bousted, of teaching union NEU, says schools that keep face
coverings are doing so ""following a risk assessment"". She
says it's a ""sensible precaution"" and it's ""bizarre"" that the government should seek to ""micromanage"". Andy Byers, a head teacher in County Durham,wrote to parents and students asking them to continue to wear face coverings, with Covid rates remaining high in the North East. The daily coronavirus data shows the total number of people who tested positive in the last seven days is 646,835.That's a decrease of 27% from the previous week. The seven-day average for deaths is 1,878 which is up 0.5%. The seven-day average for people admitted to hospital with Covid is 14,213 - down 9.9% on the week before. The UK has given a total of 137,022,678 coronavirus vaccinations, according to the government's daily figures. That's 52,186,398 first doses, 48,082,636 second doses and 36,753,644 third or booster doses. The UK has recorded a further 95,787 coronavirus cases, according to the government'sdaily coronavirus data,external. There were also 288 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid-19 test. On Thursday 107,364 cases and 330 deaths were reported. Blood donations kept Georgina (right) alive, when she was a newborn baby The Welsh Blood Service says donations are down because of Covid. Interim director Alan Prosser said winter was always challenging, without the added pressures of a pandemic. ""We've had to find larger venues because of social distancing, so we moved away from smaller community donation centres,"" he explains. In addition, the use of community donation vehicles in Wales was suspended because of Covid restrictions. Last month Scotland hadfewer registered blood donors than at any other point this century, and before Christmasthe Republic of Ireland was importing blood from England. Meanwhile England's hospitals got through the pandemic withthe smallest pool of donors in the 21st Century,external. Read the full story. Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst It is now just two weeks until the 2022 Beijing Winter Olympics and Chinaâs capital city continues to try to combat an outbreak of Covid-19 under its âzero-Covid strategyâ. Officials told a press conference today that Beijing has now confirmed 23 cases of Covid-19 since 15 January. These are spread across four districts in the city, and there have been cases of both the Delta and the Omicron variant. Beijingâs deputy police chief, Pan Xuhong, told the media about some of the Covid-19 violations that police officers have had to deal with over the last week. He mentioned the case of a 51-year-old man âjumping out of a windowâ in the cityâs Changping District, in order to break quarantine. He said the man, surnamed Xie, has now been detained. He also spoke of a 46-year-old wholesaler âreplacing import labels with domestic labelsâ after the authorities warned that import goods could pose a Covid-19 risk. Xuhong said the man is now being investigated. Read more. ONS analysis suggests UK daily Covid cases in the week after Christmas were almost three times higher than the numbers shown on the government dashboard - why is this? It's because the official numbers are affected by how many people are coming forward for tests, have chosen to report their test results, or who are taking a test because they know they have coronavirus symptoms. By contrast, the ONS figures are based on analysis of nose and throat swabs taken from a representative sample of more than 150,000 people in private households. The same people are sampled every week, regardless of whether they know they have Covid-19 or have reported a positive result. The ONS then produces estimates of the likely number of new cases of coronavirus across the country. New cases of Covid-19 in the UK averaged nearly half a million a day during the week after Christmas, almost three times the official figures, new analysis suggests. An average of 173,400 new cases of coronavirus per day were recorded from 26 December to 1 January, according to the government's Covid-19 dashboard. But the true number of cases was likely to be nearer 479,100 a day, according to estimates by the Office for National Statistics. Health agencies are urging caution about interpreting the regular case numbers published each day for the UK, following changes in rules about testing. The sharp difference in totals reflects just how many new cases of Covid-19 are being missed in the dashboard figures, which count only those people who have reported themselves as having tested positive for the virus. AntÃ³nio Horta-OsÃ³rio quit as
boss of banking giant Credit Suisse for
breaking Covid rules by going to the Wimbledon tennis finals last summer. Now it's emergedhe also went to the Euros football final at Wembleyâ on the same day. Credit Suisse had organised
corporate hospitality at the events, but Horta-OsÃ³rio took family to both after
others were unable to use the tickets,the Financial Times reports,external. Horta-OsÃ³rio went to the two
big sporting events in July, at a time when the UK's Covid restrictions
required him to be in quarantine. The England-Italy Wembley
final was later declared a Covid super-spreader event, with more than 2,000
people said to have attended while ""likely to be infectious"". Alistair ColemanBBC Monitoring Groups of anti-vaccine activists are attempting to close
down a number of Covid-19 vaccination centres across the UK, falsely
claiming that ancient English law gives them the power to do so. In recent days, at least a dozen videos have appeared online showing
attempts to âserveâ papers on staff. In one case, a centre manager is heard
telling an activist that his papers are bogus, before showing him the door. The activists are using âsovereign citizenâ theory âa bogus legal concept which we recently investigated. The groups believe they can opt out of laws they donât like and become
âcommon law constablesâ to enforce their beliefs.Neither of these concepts has any
legal force. The people invading vaccine centres cite a crime
reference number (CRN) as âproofâ that crimes are being committed. One group left
a dossier at a London police station claiming the vaccine rollout is a criminal
enterprise. But the Metropolitan Police say theyhave not opened an investigation into the claims,external, and the CRN merely shows that an allegation has been received
and recorded. A CRN is no proof that a crime has been committed, police say. Downing Street says it is not investigating allegations that MPs calling for Boris Johnson's resignation have been blackmailed by government whips. Labour called for an inquiry after senior Tory MP William Wragg said threats that would ""seem to constitute blackmail"" had been made to colleagues. No 10 says it has not seen any proof of such behaviour. A spokesman says they would look ""carefully"" at any evidence presented to them but theywere not seeking it. Separately, a group of MPs known as the ""pork pie plotters"" has been meeting regularly to discuss whether to oust Johnson over revelations he attended a drinks party during lockdown. They met on Thursday to discuss going public with their own complaints of intimidation by the whips - the MPs in charge of party discipline. The Times reports,externalthey are considering releasing text messages and a secret recording of a ""heated"" conversation with the chief whip to support their claims. Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Jakub Morawiecki has said the government will prepare more Covid hospital beds as it faces a surge in cases. The Polish government also announced that it will shorten Covid-19 isolation to seven days and will introduce free coronavirus tests in pharmacies across the country. As we reported earlier, Poland registered its highest number of daily infections on Friday - 36,665 new cases. This is an 128% increase from the previous week. Poland's health minister, Adam Niedzielski, warned that Poland could see around 140,000 daily Covid cases in a worst case scenario. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng says people should return to the office, as the UK needs to ""get back to some degree of normality"". On Wednesday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson announced an end to Plan B measures. The government isno longer asking people to work from homeand masks will no longer compulsory in public settings from 27 January. Kwarteng told LBC radio that there are ""benefits from working with colleagues, being able to interact directly with them"". He added that Covid-19 is ""turning from a pandemic into an endemic"" and ""it's something we have to live with"". Welsh Secretary Simon Hart has labelled attacks on the UK government and PM Boris Johnson by the first minister of Wales, Mark Drakeford, ""an uncalled for and opportunistic insult towards medical advisers and the public"". ""It's thanks to the decisions of UK (& Welsh) Gov, scientists, families & businesses that the UK is ahead of the world in its response to Covid,"" Mr Hart wrote in a tweet. Speaking earlier at a press briefing,external, Mr Drakeford said the UK government was ""simply not functioning"" because it was occupied by the need to deflect attention from press stories about parties held at Downing Street during lockdown. ""If anybody believes that their announcements this week on coronavirus were the result of a careful consideration of the science, or because they had a well worked out plan for what they were doing, I think that would be a very optimistic view indeed,"" the first minister said. Welsh Conservatives have claimed Wales has the worst Covid mortality rate in the UK and called for a Wales-specific Covid inquiry. Allow Twitter content?

The ""day is coming"" when the use of face masks in Scotland's schools will end, a top government adviser has said. The Scottish government's national clinical director, Prof Jason Leitch, said he believed the requirement to wear masks in schools will be withdrawn soon, but he did not know when. In England, the requirement for face masks to be worn in secondary school classrooms has been scrapped. Prof Leitch also said science had now been able to ""de-fang"" Covid, and the worst was likely behind the country. However, he warned future restrictions could still be needed. Read more.  London's major incident status is being removed, Mayor Sadiq Khan has announced. But the city will remain on high alert due to the significant threat Covid-19 and the Omicron variant still pose in the capital, he says. The major incident was declared on 18 December due to the rapid spread of the Omicron variant, a significant rise in patients in London hospitals and the impact on staff absences in frontline services. It's been ended following the gradual reduction in the number of Covid cases, manageable hospital numbers and an improvement in staff absences,Khan says.,external He is calling on the government to rethink their Covid plans and keep legislation in place to make face coverings mandatory on public transport. ""They still have a huge role to play in keeping our city open and our friends, family and communities protected,"" he says. Â© 2025 BBC.

Fans to return to Welsh stadiums as Covid rules ease,"Fans will be able to return to watch when Wales kicks-off its Six Nations in February More restrictions to people's daily lives have been eased in Wales as Omicron cases continue to decline. Pubs and restaurants in Wales can now operate outdoors without the rule of six or social distancing. All limits on sports events have been scrapped meaning thousands of fans are set to return to watch fixtures across the country. First Minister Mark Drakeford said: ""We have passed the peak and the situation has improved significantly."" It is the second part of a three-week roadmap to scrap restrictions imposed because of the Omicron variant. As it happened: Drakeford slams PM as rules ease UK ministers 'distracting people from awful mess' What are the Covid rules in Wales? From a peak of more than 2,300 cases per 100,000 people in Wales, the rate has dipped below 500 on Friday. The latest infection survey from the Office for National Statistics also estimates a fall in the number of people in Wales with Covid - affecting one in 25 of the population. The number of people in hospital and in intensive care with Covid are also both declining. The first minister said: ""Omicron was another unpleasant twist to this long-running pandemic."" Mr Drakeford said decisions to lift rules in England are being to made to deflect from the ""dire difficulties the Prime Minister has created for himself"" ""We have weathered this storm together in Wales by following the rules and these measures that have kept us safe for nearly two years,"" added Mr Drakeford. ""Sadly the pandemic is not over and coronavirus is still with us but we can look forward to the future with renewed hope and with better and brighter days ahead of us."" He previously laid out a roadmap for which restrictions will be eased and when. From 15 January, numbers allowed to attend an outdoor event rose from 50 to 500 From 21 January, all limits for outdoor activities have been scrapped with crowds able to return to sporting events. On 28 January, Wales will move to alert level zero. This means nightclubs can reopen and the rule of six will be scrapped in pubs and restaurants, although Covid passes will still be required for large events, plus cinemas, nightclubs and theatres From 10 February, a three-week review cycle returns as the country is at alert level zero But the Welsh Conservatives said Mr Drakeford should set a date for all Covid-related laws - including mask wearing and self-isolation rules - to be lifted. Plaid Cymru said the Welsh government needed to set out what else it will do to help the hospitality sector. Anyone over 18 will still have to show aCovid passto go to larger outdoor event, so they can show they are either fully vaccinated or have had a negative lateral flow test in the past 24 hours. The passes, which are being scrapped in England, will also still be required in cinemas and theatres until at least the next review on 10 February. The rule of six will be lifted for pubs and restaurants outdoors from Friday Before Mr Drakeford set outhis plans to phase out the post-Christmas rules, he had faced growing pressure to ease sporting restrictions, including from the Welsh Rugby Union (WRU), whichthreatened to move Wales' Six Nations home games to England. He toldRadio Wales Breakfast: ""I don't think anybody watching objectively what is happening in England could imagine that their decisions have been made by a careful attention to public health advice and some long-term plan. ""Their announcements are entirely down to the astonishing mess they find themselves in and an effort to create headlines that will distract the public's attention from the prime minister's failings. ""Covid passes encourage people to get out and about, using venues where they know everyone else has taken precautions."" Christmas Covid rules 'cost pubs Â£16,000 each' How many people have been vaccinated in Wales? The changes mean sports fans can return to Welsh stadiums from Saturday, with Swansea City's home game against Preston North End among the first to welcome back supporters. Season ticket holder Simon Williams said: ""It's been strange when you could do a 500 mile roundtrip to go watch us away but you couldn't go 10 minutes down the road to watch at us at home."" While Lorraine Dyer said her ""football mad"" grandsons were excited to return to the Swansea.com stadium. Swansea City season ticket holder Simon Williams said: ""Football's not the same without fans in the stadium"" Calum Darling, of Club One47 in Llandudno, has said his nightclub has lost up to 95% of its trade since restrictions had come into force. ""We've always got the most restrictions imposed on us as opposed to England, Scotland, Northern Ireland,"" he said. ""It just doesn't make sense that we're always five steps behind. There's just no logic to the reasoning behind it."" Alert level zero is the lowest level of measures, where all businesses are allowed to reopen without two-metre social distancing rules in place. If all goes to plan, the rule of six will not apply in pubs, restaurants, cinemas and theatres from 28 January. However, face masks will still be required in most indoor public places,unlike England where they will not be compulsory from Thursday. Self-isolation rules also remain in force, and work from home guidance will remain advice but will not be law. Wales,along with Scotland and Northern Ireland, brought in new Covid restrictions over Christmas because of a rapid rise in cases driven by the Omicron variant. The decision to continue easing the rules comes as Wales sees the ""fastest rate of decline"" in case numbers and the lowest rate in the UK, according to Mr Drakeford.

Electric car battery plant gets government funding,"Artist impression of the Britishvolt factory, being built in Northumberland A firm planning mass production of electric car batteries in the UK has secured government funding for its proposed factory in Northumberland. Britishvolt announced plans for the so-called gigafactory in Cambois two years ago, saying it would create 3,000 jobs. The BBC understands the government has committed about Â£100m through its Automotive Transformation Fund. Britishvolt also announced backing from investors Tritax and Abrdn, that should unlock about Â£1.7bn in private funding. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng described the support as ""reindustrialisation"". He told the BBC's Today programme that the ""huge investment"" would give people the ""opportunity to have highly-paid, well-paid, high-skilled jobs"". ""We're bringing industry, we're bringing manufacturing to an area that has been under invested in frankly and we're bringing thousands of jobs,"" he said. ""Well paid jobs, which represent a huge economic opportunity for people in this area. This is exactly what levelling up looks like. "" The government wants the UK to become a major force in the fast-growing market for electric cars. But if it wants manufacturers to build them here, then having gigafactories in the UK as well is vital. Not only are battery packs big and heavy, making local production desirable, they also make up a large proportion of the value of an electric car. And under the Brexit deal, cars made in the UK and sold in Europe will soon have to contain a significant amount of UK or European parts. Put simply: If batteries aren't made here, the chances are carmakers won't set up shop here either. Experts say the Britishvolt plant will have to be the first of many. The future of the entire UK car industry depends on it. The sale in the UK of new petrol and diesel cars will be banned by 2030, with manufacturers switching to making electric vehicles and requiring huge battery production. The government has set aside more than Â£800m to attract battery investment to the UK. Mr Kwarteng said Britishvolt would help put the UK at the front ""in this global race between countries to secure vital battery production"". At full capacity, expected to be achieved by the end of the decade, the factory will produce enough battery cells for more than 300,000 electric vehicle battery packs per year. 'Game changer' electric car battery plant approved The gigafactory is being built on the site of the former Blyth Power Station. In addition to the 3,000 people at the site, Britishvolt estimates at least another 5,000 jobs will be created in the supply chain. Peter Rolton, Britishvolt's executive chairman, told the BBC's Today programme that he would like all of the new jobs at the plant to go to people living in the area, and said the company was setting up a training centre in nearby Ashington. ""Our policy is going to be to try and not to say no to anybody,"" he added. Mr Rolton said the first batteries ready for use would roll off the production line in 2024. He said: ""This announcement is a major step in putting the UK at the forefront of the global energy transition, unlocking huge private sector investment that will develop the technology and skills required for Britain to play its part in the next industrial revolution. ""This is a truly historic day and marks the start of a truly exciting move towards a low carbon future."" Last year, Nissan's partner, China's Envision AESC, announced it would build an electric battery plant to supply an expansion of electric vehicle production at the Japanese carmaker's plant in Sunderland.

New self-isolation and table service rules in NI,"Hospitality restrictions have been relaxed in Northern Ireland Health Minister Robin Swann has said he hopes further relaxations of Covid restrictions signal ""the beginning of the end"" of the pandemic. On Friday, rules on self-isolation and table service in pubs and restaurants in Northern Ireland were relaxed. Next week, nightclubs will reopen and vaccine passports will not be needed to enter pubs, restaurants or cinemas. But Mr Swann said working from home guidance ""still stands"" and that it would be removed on a ""phased"" basis. In England, the advice to work from home has been removed, but in Northern Ireland the guidance is that people should work from home if they can, with employers ""encouraged to facilitate this"". This video can not be played Northern Ireland is coming to end of this wave of coronavirus, if not the pandemic, says Robin Swann. On Friday, the health minister told BBC News NI that any further changes would be in line with health advice and would be made clear by the executive. He also said there would be a ""full stock take"" by Stormont ministers of the remaining Covid regulations at their meeting on 10 February, including the laws on mandatory wearing of face coverings. ""I would encourage people to continue to wear them where appropriate, face coverings have played a vital role in our daily protection,"" Mr Swann added. The minister also said it was ""hugely frustrating"" that details of planned changes to Covid rules were leaked to the media ahead of Thursday's executive meeting. Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallon said she had found out about the proposals through media outlets, rather than receiving detailed papers from ministerial colleagues.

Mr Swann said it was ""not a good way to do government or governance"" and said it had been a regular occurrence during the past two years of the pandemic. ""Sometimes the executive message has been divided, but that's been caused by messages being leaked before ministers have even had a chance to discuss them,"" he added. He also said while people needed to continue to exercise a level of caution, he was optimistic that ""we are moving in the right direction"" and thanked people for making continued sacrifices. The minimum period of self-isolation for those with Covid in Northern Ireland has changed to five full days from seven. People who test positive will need to produce negative lateral flow tests on day five and day six to end their period in isolation. As of noon on Friday, premises that serve alcohol were able to drop table service. The rule of six - in which tables are limited to up to six people from no more than six households - was also lifted. Other rule changes that came into force at noon included: Guidance limiting the number of households meeting indoors to three will be removed The requirement to provide proof of exemption for not wearing a face covering will be removed with the excuse of ""severe distress"" reintroduced The guidance on working from home will revert to doing so where you can, with employers encouraged to facilitate this Further rules are due to be relaxed from noon next Wednesday, 26 January, including dropping the use of vaccine passports at pubs, restaurants and cinemas, the reopening of nightclubs and the resumption of dancing and indoor standing events. Table service is no longer be required at premises that serve alcohol Vaccine passports will still be needed for nightclubs and indoor unseated and partially-seated events with 500 or more people in attendance. Also from 26 January, the need for offices to ""take reasonable measures for 2m (6ft) social distancing"" will be removed, although risk assessments should be carried out. The moves were agreed at a Northern Ireland Executive meeting on Thursday, with ministers due to review all remaining Covid restrictions again on 10 February. NI to scrap Covid passports in pubs and restaurants What are the Covid rules after new relaxations? The restrictions that have been easedcame into place just after Christmasin a bid to manage the number of cases of the Omicron variant. First Minister Paul Givan described the changes as a ""step in the right direction"" and said they reflected the changing circumstances in Northern Ireland. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said it was ""clear we were past the peak"" in terms of coronavirus case numbers and the number of Covid-19 patients in hospital. At their meeting on Thursday, ministers were advised by health officials that there may be a ""secondary peak"" in cases in the next two weeks as a result of further spread in school-aged children, but that existing measures would be ""sufficient"" to manage hospital admissions. Paul Givan and Michelle O'Neill announced the changes to the rules while on a visit to Londonderry Mr Givan also said the next executive meeting on 10 February would be an important one, when other measures would be discussed, adding that he wanted changes to the rules regarding face coverings. The decision to drop the need for vaccine passports was welcomed by several trade bodies. Angela McGowan, the Northern Ireland director of the Confederation of British Industry, said companies would be hopeful that ""we are finally starting to turn the corner on Covid-19"". Hospitality Ulster chief executive Colin Neill said the moves would provide ""incredible relief to our industry, but it will come too late for some"". ""The work only begins now in building back and pushing forward to reinstate hospitality as the Â£2bn sector it once was."" Irish government ministers aredue to meet in Dublin laterto discuss a possible easing of Covid-19 restrictions. It is understood the National Public Health Emergency Team (NPHET) has given the green light to ending most public health measures, which came into force last month to curb the spread of the Omicron variant. Scotland, England and Wales have already announced some easing of restrictions. A number of Covid measures in England are to end from 27 January, with the advice for people to work from home being dropped, along with Covid passports and the requirement to wear a face covering in public places. In Scotland,rules on table service in hospitality venues will be lifted from Monday, when nightclubs will also be allowed to reopen, whilein Wales a three-week plan for scrapping restrictionshas been set out. The Republic of Ireland's government has suggestedchanges are likely to its restrictionstoo, including large crowds returning to outdoor events. RULES:What are the restrictions in Northern Ireland?

Covid test firm urges end to tests for travellers,"Covid tests for travellers arriving in the UK should be scrapped, one of the big testing firms has said. Simon Worrell, global medical director of Collinson - which also runs airport lounges - said: ""As soon as we can drop it, we will be delighted."" At present, all those aged five and over arriving in England must take a test within 48 hours of arriving. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said on Wednesday the government was reviewing testing arrangements for travel. He said the Health Secretary Sajid Javid would announce the outcome of the review in the coming days. Mr Worrell said Collinson, which has a large travel business that includes running customer services in airports, launched its testing sites early in the pandemic in a bid to prop up the travel industry, which a large part of his business depends on. But now, with more people able to return to the skies, the requirement for people to test on arrival has become more of a hindrance to the business, because it may put them off travelling. What are the travel rules? Pre-departure Covid travel tests to be scrapped The travel industry has continually voiced its objection to testing. Manchester Airports Group and Airlines UK on Friday renewed their calls for testing rules to become a thing of the past for fully vaccinated travellers. But virologists have expressed caution. Dr Stephen Griffin from the University of Leeds said: ""You have a moral responsibility to monitor and to know if you're infectious. It is a good idea to test."" Collinson was one of the first operators to run Covid testing stations at airports and also distributes tests through the post. It partners with a number of UK airlines and travel operators. Mr Worrell said: ""Airport testing was only ever supposed to be a band-aid, a temporary solution to get trade and tourism staggering whilst we build up immunity and we are able to fight the virus by ourselves. We are at that point now. ""The link between getting infected and hospitalisation has been broken. We are in a fantastic place - the envy of the world, I think."" Covid testing for travellers has been controversial and the government has faced criticism over its regulation of the sector. Consumer rights groups said the Department for Health and Social Care had not done enough to protect consumers from what was called a ""predictable Covid rip-off"". The government did launch an investigation to remove operators who were selling tests that, in some instances, were too cheap or not available at the price advertised. But those in the medical community are alarmed that testing for those arriving back in the UK could be removed. Dr Eleanor Gaunt, who investigates the genetic coding of viruses at the University of Edinburgh, said: ""I fully agree that this needs to happen, but the timing is premature. ""It is entirely possible that Omicron will be succeeded by a new variant and possibly one that can circumvent immunity provided by vaccination and previous infection. ""Therefore we need eyes on what viruses are moving where, until the virus becomes more predictable and endemic."" Yet not everyone in the scientific community believes testing for travellers arriving into the UK should remain. Dr Bharat Pankhania, from the University of Exeter Medical School, believes that it is time for travel tests to end, as long as community testing remains in place to identify variants of concern.

Last-ditch US-Russia talks amid Ukraine tensions,"US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov shook hands as talks proceeded at a hotel in Geneva Russia's foreign minister and his US counterpart have held what they called ""frank"" talks to try to reduce the chance of a wider conflict in Ukraine. Sergei Lavrov repeated denials that a huge Russian force assembled near Ukraine's borders would be used to invade Ukraine. Antony Blinken said America would respond severely to any invasion. Pro-Russian rebels control large parts of eastern Ukraine since a ferocious war erupted nearly eight years ago. Some 14,000 people were killed and at least two million fled their homes before fragile peace agreements were brokered. The US and its allies have threatened new sanctions if the Russian military takes action. Washington is expected to put its position in writing next week, and then further discussions will be held. With an estimated 100,000 Russian troops deployed near Ukraine, President Vladimir Putin has issued demands to the West which he says concern Russia's security, including that Ukraine be stopped from joining Nato. He wants the Western defensive alliance to abandon military exercises and stop sending weapons to eastern Europe, seeing this as a direct threat to Russia's security. EXPLAINED:Is Russia preparing to invade Ukraine? ATMOSPHERE:The mood in Kyiv and Moscow FROM BRUSSELS:EU 'closest to war' in decades over Russia-Ukraine crisis UK SUPPORT:UK says it is sending weapons to defend Ukraine For Mr Blinken, the talks were ""frank and substantive"" while for Mr Lavrov, they were also ""frank"" with an agreement to ""have a reasonable dialogue"". ""I hope emotions will decrease,"" Mr Lavrov added. Mr Blinken warned his Russian counterpart of a ""united, swift and severe"" response if Russia invaded. Speaking after the talks, he said the US was prepared to pursue possible means of addressing Russian concerns in the spirit of reciprocity. Beforehand, analysts mooted this might include more transparency on military exercises in the region, or reviving restrictions on missiles in Europe. These rules were previously set out in the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty, a Cold War-era pact thatthe US scrapped in 2019, after accusing Russia of violating the deal. Mr Blinken also urged Russia to stop what he called its aggression towards Ukraine, saying the troop build-up gave it the ability to attack Ukraine from the south, east and north. He said the US knew from experience that Moscow, which annexed Ukraine's Crimea region back in 2014, also had an ""extensive playbook"" of non-military ways of furthering its interests, including cyber attacks. He confirmed the US would continue deliveries of ""security assistance"" to Ukraine in the coming weeks. America sent anti-tank guided missile systems to Ukraine last year, as well as small arms and ammunition. Mr Blinken said the talks had also touched on Iran and negotiations over its nuclear capabilities, which he called an example of how the US and Russia can work together on security issues. For his part, Mr Lavrov described the talks as open and useful but he accused Nato of working against Russia. He reiterated Moscow's position that it had ""never threatened the Ukrainian people"" and had no plans to attack Ukraine. He also accused the Ukrainian government of using ""state terrorism"" against the rebels in the east and ""sabotaging"" the Minsk peace agreements on the conflict there. Russia's foreign minister said the US would send ""written responses"" to all of Russia's proposals next week but Mr Blinken only said America hoped to share its ""concerns and ideas in more detail in writing next week"". In a way, the spectacle is already a win for Russia, regardless of how the crisis is resolved. This is a diplomatic conflict of Russia's making. Their force movements have prompted a week of furious activity on the part of the Americans and their allies at a time when the US would much rather be focusing on what it views as an era-defining competition with an ascendant China. Instead, Russia is once again at the centre of global attention - at least for the moment. The high-stakes negotiations in Geneva hearken back to a time decades past. As Mr Blinken heads back to the Geneva airport for his flight home to Washington, it's hard to say what, if anything, has changed in these three days of crisis diplomacy. Both sides are still talking, but talk without results only goes so far. Russia could use the US written response next week as pretext for further escalation. In Ukraine, US diplomats don't know what to expect - more cyber-warfare, a ""minor incursion"" or tens of thousands of Russian troops pouring into the country from three sides and paratroopers landing in Kyiv. Anything, they say, is possible. The US seems determined to try to keep the Russians talking until the spring rains make tank invasions impractical. As for what Russia wants, both Mr Blinken and Mr Biden have been consistent in their conclusion: it ultimately depends on what's going on in Russian President Vladimir Putin's head. Anthony's analysis in full The talks between the two diplomats came just a day after Russia unveiled plans for naval drills involving more than 140 warships and more than 60 aircraft, seen as a show of strength. Also on Thursday, the US said Russian intelligence officers had been recruiting current and former Ukrainian government officials to step in as a provisional government and co-operate with an occupying Russian force in the event of an invasion. The US treasury departmentimposed sanctions on two current Ukrainian,externalmembers of parliament and two former government officials accused of being part of the plot. Some US politicians have called on President Biden to airlift weapons to Ukrainian forces Mr Blinken arrived in Geneva after a trip to Kyiv to show support for Ukraine, and talks with Britain, France and Germany in Berlin. Several European nations have now moved to bolster Nato's military deployment in eastern Europe. Spain is sending warships to join Nato naval forces in the Mediterranean and the Black Sea, and Denmark also said it would send a frigate to the Baltic Sea. French President Emmanuel Macron has offered to send troops to Romania. Earlier this week, Britain announced it was supplying Ukraine with extra troops for training and defensive weapons. This video can not be played Watch: Ukraine invasion is âa crisis with global consequencesâ In a speech on Friday, UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss called on Mr Putin to ""desist and step back from Ukraine before he makes a massive strategic mistake"" that would lead to terrible loss of life. President Biden had triggered questions about the consistency of the US line on Ukraine on Wednesday, when he bleakly predicted that Russia would ""move in"" on Ukraine, but appeared to suggest a ""minor incursion"" could attract a weaker response from the US and its allies. The message drew a rebuke from Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky, who tweeted: ""There are no minor incursions. Just as there are no minor casualties and little grief from the loss of loved ones."" Mr Biden then sought to clarify by saying any Russian troop movement across Ukraine's border would qualify as an invasion and that Moscow would ""pay a heavy price"".
