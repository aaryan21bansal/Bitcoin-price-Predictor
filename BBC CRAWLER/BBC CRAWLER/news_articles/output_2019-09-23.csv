Customers begin flying home,"This video can not be played Thomas Cook passengers face a long journey home The first flights bringing Thomas Cook holidaymakers home to the UK have landed amid some reports of disruption. The government has said it will run a ""shadow airline"" for two weeks to repatriate the 155,000 UK tourists affected by the firm's collapse. Transport secretary Grant Shapps said its response to the crisis was ""on track so far"" and ""running smoothly"". But some people have complained of long queues and disruption at airports, including one who waited nine hours. Ricky Houston said his flight to Newcastle from Corfu was delayed by nine hours on Monday. ""I feel sorry for the reps because I don't think they knew anything either. It was the hotel which kept us up to date,"" he said. Mr Shapps, who earlier attended an emergency Cobra government meeting on the government's response, said: ""People will experience delays, we're not running the original airline, but we intend to get this done all in the next two weeks and then end this phase of the rescue."" He also stressed people should not come home early from their holidays but should ""carry on and leave on the date they were supposed to leave, having first checked the Thomas Cook website before leaving for the airport"". Thomas Cook, whose roots go back to 1841, went into liquidation after last-ditch talks to raise fresh funding failed. It has left 22,000 jobs at risk worldwide, 9,000 of them in the UK. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) is coordinating the repatriation - which is the biggest in peacetime - in an undertaking called Operation Matterhorn. It has chartered 45 jets to bring customers home and will fly 64 routes on Monday, from locations including Central America and Turkey. Some 16,000 holidaymakers were booked to come back on Monday, and authorities hope to get at least 14,000 of them back to the UK. Thomas Cook: What went wrong?

Leanne Jones, a mother of two small boys, has found out that the Thomas Cook vouchers she's been given as presents by her family towards a holiday are worthless. ""I'm feeling rubbish. Every birthday and Christmas over the last two years I've been saving Thomas Cook vouchers to take my two young children on their first holiday abroad - Disneyland was the plan. ""I've got Â£800 worth and was planning to fly out next summer. I stand to lose all the money from the vouchers and my children will no longer get their holiday."" Ms Jones, who lives in Milton Keynes, has been in contact with Atol, but says the vouchers are not covered by its protection scheme. ""There is nothing anyone can do to help. ""That's it, I'm going to have to start saving again. I have no other option. We'll have to wait another two years for our next holiday."" It was her dad's idea that the family give holiday vouchers, and he's now feeling a little guilty, she says. ""It's not his fault at all. It was a good idea at the time.""

While an estimated 150,000 Britons are affected by Thomas Cook's collapse, the company has up to a further 450,000 customers abroad, some of whom have been affected. In Germany, one of Thomas Cook's main markets, insurance companies will help organise the response to its collapse. UK customers will be brought home ""as close as possible"" to their booked return date, the Department for Transport (DfT) has said. Thomas Cook planes have been impounded at Manchester Airport Customers will be on special free flights or booked on to another scheduled airline at no extra cost, withdetails of each flight to be posted on a dedicated website,externalas soon as they are available. The DfT added that a ""small number"" of passengers might need to book their own flight home and reclaim the costs. The CAA is also contacting hotels accommodating Thomas Cook customers, who have booked as part of a package, to tell them that the cost of their accommodation will be covered by the government's Air Travel Trust Fund and Air Travel Organiser's Licence scheme (Atol). Tim Johnson, policy director of the CAA, told BBC News that customers whose future holidays had been cancelled would be informed of how they can claim a refund on thewebsite,external. This video can not be played Travel expert Simon Calder on the collapse of ""the mightiest brand in travel"" Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom has said she will write to the Insolvency Service urging them to ""fast-track"" their investigation into the circumstances surrounding Thomas Cook's going into liquidation. The investigation will also consider the conduct of top directors, who have been paid a combined Â£20m in salaries and bonuses since 2014. A Cabinet spokesman said: ""People will rightly look at the size of bonuses to some of the directors and have serious concerns about that. ""There's a broader issue at play about collapsing firms and director pay and we are looking that more broadly as a government.""  22,000jobs at risk worldwide 9,000jobs at risk in the UK 150,000British holidaymakers to be repatriated 450,000customers affected internationally 34 planesowned (Airbus A321 and A330) Thomas Cook asked the government for a Â£250m bailout, the BBC understands, but this was denied. Mr Shapps defended the move on the BBC's Today programme. ""I fear it would have kept them afloat for a very short period of time and then we would have been back in the position of needing to repatriate people in any case,"" he said. The company's large debts and High Street-focused business made it a poor candidate for survival, he said. Overall, Operation Matterhorn will cost the taxpayer around Â£100m, he added. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell told the BBC the government should have bailed out Thomas Cook, ""if only to stabilise the situation while a real plan for the future of the company could be addressed"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged to help stranded holidaymakers, but also questioned whether company directors were properly motivated to ""sort such matters out"". Passengers are facing queues and disruption, from destinations such as Majorca Schapps said a task force would be set up to help the 9,000 UK employees who stand to lose their jobs. Workers at some Thomas Cook shops in Britain have already met with representatives of the firm's administrators, who told them they would be made redundant. Jobs at the tour operator's airline and in its engineering division may also go. Some workers are being kept on, however, but there is no definite number. For now, Thomas Cook's Indian, Chinese, German and Nordic subsidiaries will continue to trade as normal. This is because, from a legal standpoint, they are considered separate to the UK parent company and are not under the jurisdiction of the UK's Official Receiver. They do, however, share services - such as aircraft and IT - with their parent company and will need to strike rescue deals in the coming weeks to keep trading. Thomas Cook had secured a Â£900m rescue deal led by its largest shareholder Chinese firm Fosun in August, but a recent demand from its banks to raise a further Â£200m in contingency funding had put the deal in doubt. Fosun said in a statement: ""We extend our deepest sympathy to all those affected by this outcome."" The holiday company spent all of Sunday in talks with lenders trying to secure the additional funding and salvage the deal, but to no avail. Thomas Cook has blamed a series of issues for its problems, including political unrest in holiday destinations such as Turkey, last summer's prolonged heatwave and customers delaying booking holidays because of Brexit. Speaking to BBC News from Manchester airport, travel expert Simon Calder said Thomas Cook ""wasn't ready for the 21st Century"". ""Now everybody can pretend they are a travel agent. They've got access to all the airline seats, hotel beds, car rentals in the world and they can put things together themselves. Mr Calder, travel editor at The Independent, added that planes at the airport began to be impounded shortly after 00:00 BST. While the company was closing shops to try and cut costs, closing 21 in March, it still had more than 500 outlets, bringing large costs compared to online competitors. In another sign of its slow progress in mending its finances, it only stopped dividend payments to investors in November. If you are on a package holiday, you are covered by the Atol scheme. The scheme will pay for your accommodation abroad, although you may have to move to a different hotel or apartment. Atol will also pay to have you brought home if the airline is no longer operating. If you have a holiday booked in the future, you will also be refunded by the scheme. If you have booked a flight-only deal, you will need to apply to your travel insurance company or credit card and debit card provider to seek a refund. When Monarch Airlines collapsed in 2017, the government organised to bring home all the stranded passengers, whether they were covered by Atol or not.

Thomas Cook bosses face scrutiny over collapse,"This video can not be played Thomas Cook employees such as Ella Waine, pictured in her uniform, react to the company's collapse Thomas Cook's bosses will face scrutiny as part of an investigation into the tour operator's collapse. Business secretary Andrea Leadsomasked the official receiver,,externalwhich oversees liquidations, to look at whether bosses' actions ""caused detriment to creditors or to the pension schemes"". The request came amid criticism over executive salaries at the firm. Top directors at the holiday company have been paid a combined Â£20m in salaries and bonuses since 2014. Impact of Thomas Cook's collapse around the world Live: Latest updates as holidaymakers are flown home Thomas Cook: Your questions answered Thomas Cook customers in shock over flight prices Prime Minister Boris Johnson questioned whether directors should pay themselves ""large sums of money"" as their businesses go ""down the tubes"". ""I think the questions we've got to ask ourselves now [are]: How can this thing be stopped from happening in the future? ""How can we make sure that tour operators take proper precautions with their business models where you don't end up with a situation where the taxpayer, the state, is having to step in and bring people home?"" Mrs Leadsom said the official receiver's inquiry would look into the conduct of the firm's top directors. ""I ask that the investigation by the official receiver looks, not only at the conduct of directors immediately prior to and at insolvency, but also at whether any action by directors has caused detriment to creditors or to the pension schemes,"" shewrote in her letter to the Insolvency Service.,external The service has the power to disqualify people from serving as company directors for up to 15 years if it finds them guilty of misconduct and can pass information to criminal enforcement bodies in the most serious cases. Labour's shadow chancellor, John McDonnell, has said Thomas Cook bosses should pay back any bonuses they received. ""I think they need to really examine their own consciences about how they've brought this about and how they themselves have exploited the situation,"" he told the BBC. Thomas Cook chief executive Peter Fankhauser said he was ""deeply sorry"" about the firm's collapse and said the company had worked ""exhaustively"" to salvage a rescue deal. The company went into liquidation on Monday under the weight of a Â£1.7bn debt pile. As the result, the government is having to fly home around 155,000 customers from 18 countries. Some 22,000 jobs worldwide are at risk too, 9,000 of them in the UK. The Insolvency Service must look into every company collapse to see if directors have been up to no good, but the inquiries can take years. Business secretary Andrea Leadsom would like something quicker with Thomas Cook; public outrage at the company's rapid collapse and the attendant chaos for holidaymakers is running hot. If Mrs Leadsom is expecting Peter Fankhauser, the chief executive, or Frank Meysman, the chairman, on a stake, she should not hold her breath. It's hard to see how an investigation could show that they or the other directors deliberately drove the company into the ground. It might well find that they built up too much debt, and failed to grasp the severity of the challenges to trading posed by weaker sterling, travel bookings' move online and some untimely heatwaves. But that is a world away from a calculated attempt to enrich themselves while pushing the company into insolvency. While Mr Fankhauser and his predecessors were well rewarded for what was, in the end, a failure, the company's investors voted in favour of their remuneration at successive meetings. There might, however, be a case for an investigation along different lines, something which is hinted at in Mrs Leadsom's letter. She has asked the Insolvency Service to look at directors' conduct ""immediately prior to and at insolvency"". There could be grounds to look at the timeliness of the board's announcement to the stock exchange about the progress of its financial restructuring talks. How soon did directors know they would need to find an extra Â£200m, and when was the market told? All Thomas Cook holidays are now cancelled, while the tour operators' planes are grounded.

Much-loved brand's humble roots,"""Don't just book it - Thomas Cook it!"" is a phrase etched in the British memory. Over the years one of the world's best known holiday brands has taken millions of holidaymakers around the world, responding to technological advances in transport and social trends. Its history is also the history of how we have spent our holidays and explored an increasingly accessible world. ""There's an incredible fondness"" for the brand, says travel commentator Emma Coulthurst. ""We have grown up with it. ""You would go into your local travel agent, get your brochures, look at your brochures and go back again as a family. It was an event, booking was part of the whole experience."" Although it is now best known for its trips abroad, when cabinet-maker Thomas Cook founded the business in Leicestershire in 1841 it was for more local excursions. A former Baptist preacher, he wanted to offer working class people a form of educational entertainment to divert them from drinking which he saw as at the root of Victorian social ills. Thomas Cook thought railway trips could be used for social reform; an advert for an early excursion, right He harnessed the UK's newly built railways to offer his first 12 mile trip from Leicester to Loughborough, at the cost of a shilling per head (around Â£3in today's money),external. Those travelling were so-called ""temperance supporters"" - supporting the prohibition of alcohol. The visit was such a success that Thomas Cook repeated it over several summers on behalf of Sunday schools which laid the foundations for the business. By 1855, after having pioneered trips around the British Isles and to London's Great Exhibition, Thomas Cook set his sights across the Channel to Paris where the International Exhibition was being held. His commercial tour there, linked to other European destinations, was a huge success. More European trips followed, and before long Thomas Cook was taking travellers to America, Asia and the Middle East. Early adverts for trips, including Liverpool to New York in 1866 for 25 guineas, about Â£1,552 in today's money The company flourished, fuelled by the growing middle classes and their desire to travel. Thomas' son, John Mason Cook, eventually took over running the company from his father, who died in 1892. It stayed in family hands and, in the first quarter of the 20th Century, Thomas Cook's grandsons added winter sports, motor car tours and commercial air travel to its offerings. At the end of the 1920s it changed hands for the first of many times when the grandsons unexpectedly sold the business to the Belgian owner of the Orient Express. But as World War Two broke out, it was nationalised by the British government as part of British Railways, to save it from the Nazi occupation. The post-war years were characterised by a holiday boom in the UK. For Thomas Cook, this meant taking holidaymakers on package holidays abroad but also to its Welsh holiday camp in Prestatyn. ""I see them as a pioneer in organised travel,"" says Ms Coulthurst, from holiday price comparison website TravelSupermarket, describing how people went on package holidays as children and later as adults with their own families. ""They were in all of the main package holiday destinations."" The Going Places travel brand was merged into Thomas Cook in 2007 before being killed off But competition from other businesses also grew. Thomas Cook was taken private in the 1970s and expanded its network of High Street travel shops through a string of acquisitions. Then in 1992 it was bought by Germany's third largest bank, the Westdeutsche Landesbank. Thomas Cook's airline business was founded in 1999. Its next owner in 2001 was another German company, C&N Touristic AG, which quickly rebranded the whole business as Thomas Cook.  And in 2007 the company merged with MyTravel - owner of the Airtours and Going Places brands - and became known as the Thomas Cook Group. More acquisitions of shops and travel businesses, including websites, continued across the world. Thomas Cook's Indian, Chinese, German and Nordic subsidiaries continued to trade as normal in the immediate aftermath of the collapse of their parent company. Through its long history, it is the 21st Century that the company has found hardest to adapt to. The digital age has seen a revolution in travel. The internet and the rise of budget airlines have made holidays cheaper and more accessible than ever before. The package holiday remained popular, but customers are extremely price sensitive - and Thomas Cook's profit margins were slim. The Thomas Cook brand expanded all over the world, including in India Its history left it with expensive overheads - hundreds of shops and thousands of staff. Acquisitions left it with high debt levels, and little ability to respond to the headwinds of the travel market. Hurricanes, heatwaves and currency fluctuations have hit the company hard over the last few years. ""I think the reasons are very complex,"" says Amie Keeley, the head of news at Travel Weekly. She cites some ""questionable decisions"" years ago, when the company was under a different management and decided to expand its shop network at a time when more people were going online. ""In the short term, last summer's extended heatwave was a big reason. And they have also cited Brexit saying consumers are less confident,"" she said. Thomas Cook offered a complete holiday ""package"" of travel, accommodation and food in 1855 Ms Coulthurst says UK travellers are still booking package holidays, which gives them financial protection through the government-run Atol scheme. ""However a lot of them are booking them in different ways now,"" she adds. ""Thomas Cook has 560 travel agents on the high street, it used to have more. That's bricks and mortar, they have overheads."" She says Thomas Cook was left competing with low-cost airlines as well as rivals with a big online presence, and says: ""But [Thomas Cook's] online presence isn't as strong. They are seen as a predominantly high street shop business."" She also says in North Africa - where Thomas Cook has an ""extremely strong package holiday presence"" - there has been political unrest, such asthe ban on flights to Egypt's Sharm El-Sheikh,which has affected the tour operator. But Thomas Cook has retained a dedicated following, taking 19 million people from the UK and other countries on holiday each year. ""It's an iconic travel brand that has been in existence for 178 years,"" says Ms Keeley from Travel Weekly, adding it is ""much-loved"" both by consumers and those in the travel industry. Even the company's competitors did not want to see Thomas Cook collapse, she adds, not just because of the wider impact on the industry but also from an ""emotional and heritage point of view"". ""A lot of people have worked for Thomas Cook or work with them, so everyone is rooting for them."" For its loyal customers and for its 22,000 staff members, the company has stayed true to its roots - democratising travel and in the words of Thomas Cook himself making it ""a social idea"".

Thomas Cook: Much-loved brand with humble roots,"""Don't just book it - Thomas Cook it!"" is a phrase etched in the British memory. Over the years one of the world's best known holiday brands has taken millions of holidaymakers around the world, responding to technological advances in transport and social trends. Its history is also the history of how we have spent our holidays and explored an increasingly accessible world. ""There's an incredible fondness"" for the brand, says travel commentator Emma Coulthurst. ""We have grown up with it. ""You would go into your local travel agent, get your brochures, look at your brochures and go back again as a family. It was an event, booking was part of the whole experience."" Although it is now best known for its trips abroad, when cabinet-maker Thomas Cook founded the business in Leicestershire in 1841 it was for more local excursions. A former Baptist preacher, he wanted to offer working class people a form of educational entertainment to divert them from drinking which he saw as at the root of Victorian social ills. Thomas Cook thought railway trips could be used for social reform; an advert for an early excursion, right He harnessed the UK's newly built railways to offer his first 12 mile trip from Leicester to Loughborough, at the cost of a shilling per head (around Â£3in today's money),external. Those travelling were so-called ""temperance supporters"" - supporting the prohibition of alcohol. The visit was such a success that Thomas Cook repeated it over several summers on behalf of Sunday schools which laid the foundations for the business. By 1855, after having pioneered trips around the British Isles and to London's Great Exhibition, Thomas Cook set his sights across the Channel to Paris where the International Exhibition was being held. His commercial tour there, linked to other European destinations, was a huge success. More European trips followed, and before long Thomas Cook was taking travellers to America, Asia and the Middle East. Early adverts for trips, including Liverpool to New York in 1866 for 25 guineas, about Â£1,552 in today's money The company flourished, fuelled by the growing middle classes and their desire to travel. Thomas' son, John Mason Cook, eventually took over running the company from his father, who died in 1892. It stayed in family hands and, in the first quarter of the 20th Century, Thomas Cook's grandsons added winter sports, motor car tours and commercial air travel to its offerings. At the end of the 1920s it changed hands for the first of many times when the grandsons unexpectedly sold the business to the Belgian owner of the Orient Express. But as World War Two broke out, it was nationalised by the British government as part of British Railways, to save it from the Nazi occupation. The post-war years were characterised by a holiday boom in the UK. For Thomas Cook, this meant taking holidaymakers on package holidays abroad but also to its Welsh holiday camp in Prestatyn. ""I see them as a pioneer in organised travel,"" says Ms Coulthurst, from holiday price comparison website TravelSupermarket, describing how people went on package holidays as children and later as adults with their own families. ""They were in all of the main package holiday destinations.""

Labour promises 32-hour working week,"This video can not be played McDonnell: 'We should work to live, not live to work' The average working week in the UK would be cut to 32 hours within 10 years under a Labour government, John McDonnell has announced. This would reduce it to the equivalent of four days - although it would not necessarily mean a day off as other methods could be used to cut hours. The shadow chancellor said the cut could be done with ""no loss of pay"". The average UK full-time working week is 42.5 hours versus an EU average of 41.2,statistics body Eurostat says.,external ""We should work to live, not live to work. As society got richer, we could spend fewer hours at work,"" Mr McDonnell told Labour's annual conference in Brighton. ""But in recent decades progress has stalled, and since the 1980s the link between increasing productivity and expanding free time has been broken. It's time to put that right."" Labour pledged to introduce four new public holidays in their 2017 general election manifesto but did not mention working hours. Do Britons work the longest hours in Europe? Labour vow to 'integrate' private schools Tensions on display as election looms In a wide-ranging speech, Mr McDonnell also vowed to: End the UK's opt out from the EU working time directive, which caps at 48 the number of hours people can work in an average week End the ""modern evil"" of in-work poverty within Labour's first term in office Expand public services free at the point of use including childcare, post-school education, public transport for under-25s and school meals Make personal social care free at the point of use,at an estimated cost of Â£6bn a year Mr McDonnell said negotiations over working hours would be carried out as part of plans to roll out collective bargaining across different industries. Collective bargaining is where wage rates and conditions are agreed between employees and trade unions, a practice that used to be commonplace in British industry. ""We'll require working hours to be included in the legally binding sectoral agreements between employers and trade unions,"" said Mr McDonnell. ""This will allow unions and employers to decide together how best to reduce hours for their sector. ""And we'll set up a Working Time Commission with the power to recommend to government on increasing statutory leave entitlements as quickly as possible without increasing unemployment."" The Working Time Commission would also have the power to increase statutory holiday entitlement, which is currently 28 days. In his speech, Mr McDonnell also defendedthe Labour leadership's Brexit stance,which would see Jeremy Corbyn promise to negotiate a new deal with Brussels and then put it to a referendum, with the party to decide whether it backs Remain or Leave at a special one-day conference nearer the time. He said cancelling Brexit, by revoking Article 50, would send out the wrong message. ""We can't say to people 'Labour wants you to share in the running of your workplace, your community and your environment, but we don't trust you to have the final say over Brexit.'"" The shadow chancellor's proposals for a shorter working week were welcomed by the trade unions. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""It's time for working people to share in the benefits of new technology."" And the national co-ordinator for Labour campaign group Momentum, Laura Parker, said its members were ""delighted"" that a policy they had campaigned for was being adopted. ""This is what a democratic party looks like,"" she said. ""Policy is being written by the movement, with members and the leadership working hand in hand to write the next manifesto and deliver the ambitious, radical policies we need to win the next election."" But CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn, who represents business, said: ""Who would turn down a four day week on the same pay? But without productivity gains it would push many businesses into loss."" In an average week, the total of all hours worked by the entire workforce is 1.05 billion. If you assumed the workforce remained the same, then this policy would see total hours worked cut by around 100 million hours. In and of itself, it would have a significant effect on the economy. But the opposition argue not just that the policy will not cost the economy, but that individual workers will not get a pay cut. How is such a free lunch, indeed tens of millions of such lunches, possible? It requires an epic increase in productivity, how much each worker actually produces, something that has eluded the UK economy. Business organisations fear that this is the cart before the horse, requiring huge capital investment. The opposition are essentially trying to grab the benefits of a future decade of technological advancements towards workers, rather than business owners. Read more from Faisal Areport by cross-bench peer,externalLord Skidelsky - commissioned by Labour and published earlier this month - recommended that people should work fewer hours to earn a living. The report said capping workers' hours to a four-day week would not be ""realistic or even desirable"", citing France's introduction of a 35-hour working week in 1998. ""The evidence is that, after a brief impact effect, France's legislation was rendered broadly ineffective by an accumulation of exceptions and loopholes,"" it said. Labour said its policy would not be a French-style ""cap"" on hours because it would rely on sector-wide agreements rather than enforcement action against individual companies.

Labour cash boost for wind farms and electric cars,"This video can not be played Long Bailey sets out Labour environment plan Labour is pledging to invest billions of pounds in electric car production and offshore wind farms to accelerate the ""green industrial revolution"". A future Labour government would take equity stakes in car producers in return for a Â£3bn capital investment in new electric models and machinery. Thirty-seven publicly-owned wind farms will be built, with the profits used to regenerate deprived coastal areas. Delegates have been debating the pace of decarbonisation at the conference. Earlier this year, Parliament approved a law requiring the UK to bring all greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050, a stricter target compared with the previous one of at least an 80% reduction from 1990 levels. Labour delegates, many of whom want a more ambitious strategy, approved a motion calling for a 2030 zero net emissions target as part of a green new deal. Corbyn wins party backing in crunch Brexit vote Labour promises 32-hour working week This does not automatically become part of Labour's manifesto, however, as the party's policy will be determined during the drafting process. Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said she would be willing to support the more ambitious target if there was a ""credible plan with trade unions and industry"", and a ""just transition"" that did not adversely affect workers. She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Provided we have a plan, I am happy to work as quickly as possible. I know we have got to act faster and we've got to push people to do that."" Some unions, including the GMB, are concerned this is too ambitious and want guarantees that it will not lead to massive job losses in the automotive, energy and industrial sectors.

Firms will be able to bid for funding over two years to bring new electric car models to market, in return for the government taking an equity stake in their business. A further Â£2.3bn will be set aside to build three battery plants to supply electric cars. The plants are  earmarked for South Wales, Stoke and Swindon - the latter potentially on the site of the Honda factory due to close in 2021. Labour has already signalled this week it would spend Â£3.6bn on new electric charging infrastructure and introduce 2.5 million interest free loans to spur the take-up of electric models. Announcing the new plans, Ms Long Bailey said the state should ""not be afraid to intervene"" to ensure the success of the automotive sector in light of the huge technological and economic challenges it faced. ""The sector is under siege from Brexit uncertainty and the government's lack of ambition on electrification,"" she said. ""At the same time, we need to accelerate the shift away from fossil-powered cars if we are to tackle the climate emergency. ""Labour's support package will offer a lifeline for a new clean era of manufacturing."" Jeremy Corbyn has said 2050 is too late to decarbonise the economy, although he hasn't offered an alternative date. The question is: could the UK achieve Momentum's preferred goal of 2030? Most energy economists say it's impossible without massive social upheaval. Just imagine - no petrol or diesel cars, and no gas central heating. But an increasing number of people are warning that with climate change accelerating faster than expected, society will need to accept major disruption to protect the planet for future generations. Labour's plans to support wind energy and battery cars build on Conservative policies which have caused the cost of renewables to plummet. But will Labour plan cut out the free market competition that's created the fall in energy prices? Environmentalists will also demand a broader vision of what's known as the ""just transition"" to a clean economy. They want to see a masterplan for retraining workers from dirty industries and supporting them to move to new areas with clean jobs. They want support for workers too old to retrain. Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin In a series of green energy announcements on Tuesday, Labour will commit to using billions in public money to accelerate the transition to carbon-free transport and power systems. Labour is also planning an unprecedented intervention in the renewables industry, modelled on countries including Norway, Sweden and Denmark. To counter what it says is the domination of foreign firms in the UK's offshore market, it is proposing to take a 51% stake in a new public-private venture, which would build 37 new offshore wind farms capable of supplying the energy needs of 57 million households. Profits from the scheme would be reinvested in the wider energy network as well as a ""People's Power Fund"" - which would see up to Â£1bn each year for recreational and leisure facilities in struggling coastal communities. This, Labour says, will create 67,000 high-skilled jobs in Scotland, East Anglia, Yorkshire and North-East England. The CBI said it wanted to work with Labour and other parties to make a success of the transition to a zero-net carbon economy. Labour says the offshore wind sector is too dominated by foreign firms But the employers' group said ""in the push to reach net-zero as fast and as cost-effectively as possible, renationalisation will hugely disrupt the investment needed in the energy sector to decarbonise"". The Conservatives said the wind farms plan could cost up to Â£80bn and that ""nationalising huge swathes of the energy network"" would set back efforts to tackle climate change. ""It is by working with business that we've ensured offshore wind will provide more than a third of our electricity by 2030, tripling the number jobs in the industry and keeping bills low for consumers,"" said Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom. Labour has made a raft of policy pledges during its conference, including plans to abolish prescription charges in England, push for a 32-hour working week and integrate private schools into the state system. The first three days in Brighton, though, have been dominated by Brexit divisions and internal wrangling. But Jeremy Corbyn received a major boost to his authority on Monday when delegates backed his ""wait and see"" policy of leaving a decision about which side the party would back in another Brexit referendum until after the next general election. Deputy leader Tom Watson, who has led calls for a more assertive pro-EU position and who survived efforts to oust him on Friday, will address the conference on Tuesday.

PM defends actions over conflict of interest claims,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Everything done in the proper way"" Boris Johnson has denied any impropriety following claims he failed to declare a potential conflict of interest while London mayor. The Sunday Times,externalsaid Jennifer Arcuri - who knew Mr Johnson - joined trade missions he led and received thousands of pounds in sponsorship grants. The PM earlier refused address the allegations, but later said ""everything was done entirely in the proper way."" She told the paper it was part of her role as a legitimate businesswoman. Labour has said Mr Johnson must give a full account of his actions, but pressed by journalists during a flight to New York on Sunday night, the now-prime minister refused to comment. On Monday evening, though, he told the BBC's John Pienaar: ""All I can say is I am very proud of what we did as Mayor of London... particularly banging the drum for our city and country around the world."" He added: ""I can tell you that absolutely everything was done entirely in the proper way."" Johnson 'must address conflict of interest claims' Technology entrepreneur Ms Arcuri is believed to have moved to London seven years ago - Mr Johnson was mayor between 2008 and 2016. She joined a joined a number of trade missions led by him while in office, and it is understood she attended events on two of these trips - to New York and Tel Aviv - despite not officially qualifying for them as a delegate. The Sunday Times reported that one of her businesses received Â£10,000 and Â£1,500 in sponsorship money from a mayoral organisation when Mr Johnson was mayor, as well as a Â£15,000 government grant for foreign entrepreneurs to build businesses in Britain. The newspaper also said Ms Arcuri got a Â£100,000 grant from the Department of Culture, Media and Sport earlier this year. The grant was intended for ""English-based"" businesses - although she had moved back to the US in June 2018. The Sunday Times said it had found the registered address on the grant application form was a rented house in the UK and no longer connected to her. The government has confirmed to the BBC it is investigating, but said the funds were awarded to a UK-registered company. Boris Johnson with Jennifer Arcuri at an event in 2014 Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said it was ""perfectly normal"" for entrepreneurs to join trade missions, aimed at promoting British businesses overseas. He told the BBC: ""British companies and entrepreneurs go on trade missions. It's quite right and proper and I'm sure that's exactly what's happened there."" Allow Twitter content?

The current London Mayor, Labour's Sadiq Khan, said he had ordered City Hall officials to look into the allegations. Journalists asked Mr Johnson about the allegations when travelling with him to the UN General Assembly in New York. The PM told reporters he was there to ""talk about what we're doing in the UN and this country's commitment to tackle climate change"", as well as ""the crisis in the Gulf and any other issues that may arise"". Asked again, he replied: ""I'm here to talk exclusively about the work of the UN."" Ms Arcuri was quoted by the Sunday Times as saying: ""Any grants received by my companies and any trade mission I joined were purely in respect of my role as a legitimate businesswoman."" The woman at the centre of this story is Jennifer Arcuri, who describes herself on Twitter as an entrepreneur, cyber security expert and producer. She began her career as a DJ on Radio Disney, before moving into film - where she wrote, produced and directed a short film that went on to be sold at Cannes Film Festival. Ms Arcuri then brought in her tech skills to create a streaming platform for independent film makers. But it was her founding of The Innotech Network in London that saw her path cross with Boris Johnson. The network hosts events to discuss tech policy, and Mr Johnson was the keynote speaker at the first of those in 2012. Since then, Ms Arcuri has also founded another company called Hacker House, which uses ethical hackers to find tech solutions for businesses.

Thomas Cook collapse: As it happened,"Get in touch: bizlivepage@bbc.co.uk Thomas Cook collapses into liquidation All flights and holidays have been cancelled Repatriation of 150,000 Brits abroad begins Some 21,000 jobs at risk, including 9,000 in the UK Dearbail Jordan, Simon Read and Becky Morton That's it for today. We'll be back from 6am on Tuesday morning.. Do join us then for all the latest breaking news and analysis, including the latest on Thomas Cook. Sam Emerton and his partner Shaylee, from Milton Keynes, arrived in Fuerteventura early Monday morning only to discover that Thomas Cook had collapsed. He told the BBC their hotel is now demanding payment if they want to stay there. We drove to Gatwick at 1:30 in the morning, unbeknown to us that Thomas Cook had collapsed. No-one told us. Our flight landed and we got our bags, only to be greeted by no-one. The Thomas Cook stand was empty.  About half an hour later a woman showed up to tell us Thomas Cook had gone bust, there were no transfers to the hotel and the hotel would not accept us unless we paid 1,211 Euros. We have been paying Â£330 a month since March for this all-inclusive holiday.  We are currently waiting in the hotel for the staff to receive the OK from the CAA that they will be paid. We put them onto the phone with the CAA but at the moment all the hotel is offering is that we can pay for one night and see if the situation is resolved tomorrow.  Are you a former or current Thomas Cook employee? The Money Advice Service has put together some details about where you stand with redundancy and your pension. You'll find it here,external Simon JackBBC Business Editor In the end Thomas Cook was a victim of that serial company killer
â debt. When you owe Â£1.7bn, not much needs to go wrong to tip you
over the edge â and with Thomas Cook a lot had been going wrong. In fact,
Thomas Cook has been struggling for a decade. Mergers with MyTravel and Co-Op
had left it with 1,200 high street stores JUST as consumers were moving online. It had a near death experience in 2011 but was saved when its lenders agreed to
support it during a restructuring that saw it close over 600 bricks and
mortar outlets. Thomas Cookâs basic business model is to buy up package holidays
in bulk months in advance and then sell them on. It's inherently risky as terror
attacks, currency moves, unexpected heatwaves in the UK and uncertainty
about ease of travel and insurance arrangements after Brexit could and
did hit demand leaving the company exposed. In May it announced a loss of Â£1.5bn, pushing it further into debt. Its largest shareholder, the Chinese company
Fosun - which also owns another holiday company, Club Med â offered to plough in Â£450m but the companyâs
lenders didnât think there was enough cash to see it through the lean winter
months. It required another Â£200m and when that couldnât be raised
privately, it turned to the government, which refused, just as it had with contractor Carillion
to prop up a private company with taxpayers' money. Thomas
Cookâs chief executive took home Â£8m in pay and bonuses in the
last four years and there will be an investigation into the conduct of directors.
That will be little comfort to 21,000 Thomas Cook workers who are facing unemployment rather
than a bit of holiday disruption. Passengers flying into Manchester on the last Thomas Cook flight were told how one crew member had been with the airline for 22 years. Flight TCX2643 arrived at Manchester Airport from Orlando at 08:30. Passenger Elizabeth Evans, from Bury, Greater Manchester, was on the flight with her husband Chris. She said: The pilot just kept thanking the staff and the lead hostess thanked the pilot. It's a sad day for them. It was sad to see them crying as we were getting off. One of the staff has done 22 years. Now it's come to this.  This was the ""heartwarming"" note that was posted on a Thomas Cook store in Sheffield earlier. Mark Newby took the photo of the Fargate store in the city centre this afternoon. The message, which appears to have been written by a former customer, thanked staff who had helped them book holidays. It said: ""My heart goes out to those who should be going to work today."" The government has held an emergency Cobra meeting to discuss
its response to the collapse of Thomas Cook. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says the government will be
running a âshadow airlineâ for the next two weeks to repatriate 150,000 Brits. He says the Cobra meeting discussed the governmentâs response, which he says is âon track
so farâ and ârunning smoothlyâ. The first nine replacement aircraft are in the air with passengers, with several thousand passengers due to arrive back in the UK today, he adds. A cross government task force is also being
set up to help the 9,000 employees losing their jobs, Mr Shapps says. He stresses people should not come home early from their holidays but leave the day they had originally planned to, after checking the Thomas Cook website before leaving for the airport. BBC Radio Leicester Ella Waine, a member of Thomas Cookâs cabin crew, says she
only found out the company had collapsed from passengers when the flight from Egypt she
was working on landed in the UK this morning. âWhen we landed a lot of
passengers got their phones out and said, âlook Iâm really sorry but have you
seen the news?â âAnd then it was a complete
heart to the stomach moment, it was like âOh god, itâs actually happened,â the
19-year-old tells the BBC. âThere was so much speculation around it that
we really thought we could pull through with thisâ¦ it was really devastating.â Ella says she is gutted to lose
her âdream jobâ after joining the company in February and staff still donât
know whether they will be paid at the end of the month. âIâm 19-years-old and Iâve been made redundant. That
rarely happens to people my age to be honest so itâs a big shock,â she adds. BBC Radio 5 Live Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

official as saying. The
official told the website that Thomas Cook used to fly eight times a month to

If Thomas Cook customers can't get compensation, their insurance may kick in, according to the Association of British Insurers. Mark Shepherd, assistant director, head of general insurance policy, at the ABI, said: Travel insurance policies can provide back up if compensation cannot be accessed from ATOL cover, banks or credit card providers. In the first instance, customers should check their policies on what cover they have. Those with scheduled airline failure or end supplier failure should be able to get compensation for the cost of the flight. Where travel disruption is included, they will be covered for extra costs, such as additional hotel accommodation or the cost of new flights, where these are not recoverable from any other source  Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter While future travellers on
package deals will be covered by ATOL protection, some Thomas Cook customers on
flight-only deals may need to find another route for a refund. That will include making a
claim via their travel insurance company. But analysis by data
information company Defaqto shows that 45% of travel insurance policies do not
cover airline failure. Another 8% require customers to pay extra as it is
optional. For those without cover, the
route will be making a claim via the provider of the credit, or possibly debit,
card they used to pay for it. Holidaymakers relaxing on a Lanzarote beach Connor McKeown, in Lanzarote with his girlfriend, is hoping to get on a flight to Manchester this evening. He told the BBC even getting to the airport could be difficult. I'm sat here on a lovely sunny day, but we're properly in the dark.

Thomas Cook: Your rights,"Thomas Cook has collapsed, triggering the biggest ever peacetime repatriation aimed at bringing more than 150,000 British holidaymakers home. The company, its customers and staff had hoped for a rescue deal, but now that last hope has gone, they will be looking at the practicalities for the near future. About 800,000 British people had future bookings and the company had 9,000 employees in the UK. Anyone who has bought a package holiday will be covered by theAir Travel Organiser's Licence scheme (Atol),external. You would have received an Atol certificate when you booked. This means you will not be going away, but the cost of the holiday will be refunded. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) will be launching an online service to manage all refunds on Monday, 7 October. It has asked people not to submit anything to the CAA before then. The CAA said all refunds should be processed within two months of a claim form being submitted properly. Customers who were paying by direct debit should be refunded within 14 days, The majority of Thomas Cook holidays are packages. Stating the obvious, everything that was paid for as part of the package - such as flights, accommodation, and excursions - will be refunded. Some holidaymakers might have paid separately for airport parking or car hire while away. In this situation, they would need to make a claim from their travel insurer for the cost. In more extreme cases, such as a wedding, there may be a host of other things that could be affected. Specialist cover, such as wedding insurance, may be the only route for those left out of pocket. No. Holidaymakers with package deals get a refund, as that is what the Atol protection states. Booking a new holiday in the very near future might have got more expensive. Some other operators which used Thomas Cook flights will try to switch their customers to an alternative at no extra cost. Others may be on cruises organised and paid through Thomas Cook. It is best to contact those operators directly as they will be prepared to explain the status of the holiday. The Atol protection covers packages, not flight-only deals. So that means you would not get an automatic refund. The main alternative is claiming a refund from the provider of the credit or debit card you used, so-called section 75 rules. Otherwise you may need to make a claim on travel insurance. That is why it is always advised to buy travel insurance at the same time as booking a holiday. Analysis by data company Defaqto shows that 45% of travel insurance policies do not cover the collapse of an airline, so not everyone will be covered. A spokesman for the Association of British Insurers says: ""As a last resort, travel insurance with scheduled airline failure cover can cover the cost of a flight when the airline has gone into administration. A travel insurance policy with travel disruption cover will cover the cost of new travel arrangements."" Thomas Cook collapses as last-ditch rescue talks fail Thomas Cook latest: Repatriation begins Thomas Cook: What went wrong? There may be a little more protection if the hotel you booked was linked to the flight, such as a click-through when booking the flight. That could be covered by the Atol scheme. Anyone who bought a Thomas Cook package that did not include a flight may be covered under the separate Abta scheme. At the moment, enjoy your break as much as you can - do not cut it short. That said, the repatriation operation will only run up to and including Sunday 6 October. After that, travellers would have to make their own plans, although those covered by Atol will be refunded. Hoteliers will be paid via the Atol scheme, so they should not ask for any extra payment from holidaymakers. UK package holiday customers will be brought home ""as close as possible"" to their booked return date, the Department for Transport (DfT) has said. They must take their original ticket information with them and will be issued with a fresh boarding card for their flight. Customers will be on special free flights or booked on to another scheduled airline at no extra cost, with details of each flight to beposted on a dedicated CAA website,externalas soon as they are available, up to 72 hours before its scheduled departure. The CAA said some people might be flown to different UK airports from the ones originally scheduled, but free transfers would be provided. The DfT added that a ""small number"" of passengers might need to book their own flight home and reclaim the costs. Thomas Cook had 600,000 customers on holiday from around the world, including more than 150,000 from the UK, so it will be a huge logistical challenge. When the Monarch airline collapsed, there were arguments fora better repatriation system,external, but nothing has been implemented as yet. It looks like any direct debit to Thomas Cook is pointless, but most people will not need to cancel it. If a direct debit is due to be taken on Tuesday, then you should cancel it straight away with your bank, according to banking trade body UK Finance. Any payments from other customers at a later date will not be processed owing to the insolvency. Any money that has been paid towards a package holiday already should be refunded via the Atol scheme, so you will need to make a claim for it in due course. The same is true of a deposit. Nothing is clear on that yet. It is highly likely that gift cards or vouchers will be worthless, consumer experts say. It will depend on what happens to the company - whether it is rekindled and whether any vouchers would then be honoured. If they are useless, then the person who bought it might be able to make a claim to their credit card provider if it was a generous gift of more than Â£100, or their debit card provider for less. There is better news for those with a pre-paid Thomas Cook currency card, as any funds held on that are protected separately from the company, so will not be lost. Thomas Cook ran domesticticket and hotel packages for sporting events. As the business has ceased trading, they would no longer be valid, although anyone with trips planned could try contacting the destination direct. For example, Thomas Cook would have sold 360 hospitality packages for home matches at Liverpool football club's Anfield ground. ""We are currently assessing the impact of Thomas Cook ceasing trading and the impact for those supporters who have purchased packages from Thomas Cook. Once we have those details from Thomas Cook, we will update supporters,"" the football club said. Some people had booked travel and tickets for the forthcoming American football games in London through Thomas Cook. The NFL said it was investigating and would give further information soon. As most people would not have any insurance cover for such a trip, a refund claim would probably have to be made to the provider of the credit or debit card used to pay. While customers will be worried about their holidays, staff will be heartbroken about their livelihoods. Staff are being informed about what has happened to their jobs, with written confirmation to follow. A group of special managers, from accountancy firm KPMG, have been appointed and will contact staff with a case reference number which will allow them tomake a claim for redundancy payments,external. The Pension Protection Fund (PPF) should step in to protect the more than 13,000 members of Thomas Cook's four pension schemes. Workers who are over the age of their normal retirement will get full benefits, while those who have not yet reached normal retirement age will be paid 90% of their promised pension, up to a cap of Â£40,000. Members with bigger pensions will get at least 50% of their old age pensions, under PPF rules. Meanwhile, the 3,000 or so retired members of Thomas Cook's pension schemes will continue to have their pensions paid in full by the trustees. Were you a member of staff at Thomas Cook?

PM defends actions over conflict of interest claimsReports say an associate was given public money and invited on trade trips when he was London mayor.UK Politics,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Everything done in the proper way"" Boris Johnson has denied any impropriety following claims he failed to declare a potential conflict of interest while London mayor. The Sunday Times,externalsaid Jennifer Arcuri - who knew Mr Johnson - joined trade missions he led and received thousands of pounds in sponsorship grants. The PM earlier refused address the allegations, but later said ""everything was done entirely in the proper way."" She told the paper it was part of her role as a legitimate businesswoman. Labour has said Mr Johnson must give a full account of his actions, but pressed by journalists during a flight to New York on Sunday night, the now-prime minister refused to comment. On Monday evening, though, he told the BBC's John Pienaar: ""All I can say is I am very proud of what we did as Mayor of London... particularly banging the drum for our city and country around the world."" He added: ""I can tell you that absolutely everything was done entirely in the proper way."" Johnson 'must address conflict of interest claims' Technology entrepreneur Ms Arcuri is believed to have moved to London seven years ago - Mr Johnson was mayor between 2008 and 2016. She joined a joined a number of trade missions led by him while in office, and it is understood she attended events on two of these trips - to New York and Tel Aviv - despite not officially qualifying for them as a delegate. The Sunday Times reported that one of her businesses received Â£10,000 and Â£1,500 in sponsorship money from a mayoral organisation when Mr Johnson was mayor, as well as a Â£15,000 government grant for foreign entrepreneurs to build businesses in Britain. The newspaper also said Ms Arcuri got a Â£100,000 grant from the Department of Culture, Media and Sport earlier this year. The grant was intended for ""English-based"" businesses - although she had moved back to the US in June 2018. The Sunday Times said it had found the registered address on the grant application form was a rented house in the UK and no longer connected to her. The government has confirmed to the BBC it is investigating, but said the funds were awarded to a UK-registered company. Boris Johnson with Jennifer Arcuri at an event in 2014 Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said it was ""perfectly normal"" for entrepreneurs to join trade missions, aimed at promoting British businesses overseas. He told the BBC: ""British companies and entrepreneurs go on trade missions. It's quite right and proper and I'm sure that's exactly what's happened there."" Allow Twitter content?

The current London Mayor, Labour's Sadiq Khan, said he had ordered City Hall officials to look into the allegations. Journalists asked Mr Johnson about the allegations when travelling with him to the UN General Assembly in New York. The PM told reporters he was there to ""talk about what we're doing in the UN and this country's commitment to tackle climate change"", as well as ""the crisis in the Gulf and any other issues that may arise"". Asked again, he replied: ""I'm here to talk exclusively about the work of the UN."" Ms Arcuri was quoted by the Sunday Times as saying: ""Any grants received by my companies and any trade mission I joined were purely in respect of my role as a legitimate businesswoman."" The woman at the centre of this story is Jennifer Arcuri, who describes herself on Twitter as an entrepreneur, cyber security expert and producer. She began her career as a DJ on Radio Disney, before moving into film - where she wrote, produced and directed a short film that went on to be sold at Cannes Film Festival. Ms Arcuri then brought in her tech skills to create a streaming platform for independent film makers. But it was her founding of The Innotech Network in London that saw her path cross with Boris Johnson. The network hosts events to discuss tech policy, and Mr Johnson was the keynote speaker at the first of those in 2012. Since then, Ms Arcuri has also founded another company called Hacker House, which uses ethical hackers to find tech solutions for businesses.

French trial on fatal weight-loss drug begins,"Mediator was banned after three decades of use A landmark French trial is due to begin to decide whether a diabetes pill prescribed for weight loss was behind the deaths of up to 2,000 people. Servier, the drug's manufacturer, is accused of deceiving users over the killer side effects of a drug later used to treat overweight diabetics. Believed to be one of France's biggest healthcare scandals, the firm is on trial for manslaughter and deceit. Servier has denied the charges, saying it did not lie about the side effects. French health experts believe the drug known as Mediator could have killed anywhere between 500 and 2,000 people before it was finally taken off the market in 2009. The country's state drug regulator, accused of not acting to prevent deaths and injuries, is also on trial. The trial will involve more than 2,600 plaintiffs and 21 defendants, and is expected to run over the course of six months. France braced for diabetic drug scandal report France pledges reform after diabetes drug scandal It will also look into why the drug, which was introduced in 1976, was allowed to sell for so long despite various warnings. Lawyers representing the plaintiffs argue that the drug manufacturer purposely misled patients for decades, and that this was bolstered by lenient authorities. Servier has been accused of profiting at least â¬1bn ($1.1bn, Â£880m) from the drug's sales. ""The trial comes as huge relief. Finally, we are to see the end of an intolerable scandal,""Dr Irene Frachon, a pulmonologist credited with lifting the lid on the side effects, told Reuters news agency,external. Dr Frachon's research drew on medical records across France and concluded that there was a clear pattern of heart valve problems among Mediator users. This prompted many more studies which ultimately led to the drug's ban. One study concluded that 500 deaths could be linked to Mediator between 1976 and 2009. A second one put the figure at 2,000. Those numbers have been disputed by Servier, which has said that there are only three documented cases where death can be clearly attributed to the use of Mediator. In other cases, it says, aggravating factors were at work. Irene Frachon's research concluded a pattern of heart problems among Mediator users Servier has said it will continue to compensate victims and has paid almost â¬132m to patients. ""There is a series of circumstances highlighting how all this took place,"" a lawyer for the drug company told Reuters. Several European countries, like Spain and Italy, banned the drug in the early 2000s. Based on a molecule called benfluorex, Mediator was first developed in 1976 as a lipopenic - a drug to lower fat levels in the blood. Later, it was prescribed to diabetics to help them lose weight. But as its appetite-suppressant properties were recognised, family doctors began offering Mediator as a general treatment. Anyone worried about putting on the pounds could be offered a course of the drug - even though legally it was authorised for diabetics alone. By the time it was taken off the market, it is believed that some five million people had taken Mediator, making it among the 50 most-prescribed drugs in France.

Corbyn wins party backing in crunch Brexit vote,"This video can not be played There was confusion over the show of hands vote Jeremy Corbyn's policy on Brexit has triumphed at Labour conference, as members endorsed his stance to stay neutral while negotiating a new deal. The party voted against a motion which would have seen Labour backing Remain in any future referendum. But there was confusion as the votes were called, as the chair of the proceedings faced calls for a recount. Labour's position on Brexit has dominated the conference agenda, with huge disagreements over the issue. The party's draft plan for its Brexit policy, put forward by Mr Corbyn, suggests that, if Labour wins power in a general election, it would remain neutral while negotiating a new deal with the EU within three months. Labour tensions on full display Corbyn plays down Labour splits amid aide's exit Where does Labour stand on Brexit? It would then hold a referendum within six months, and the party would decide which side to back ahead of that at a special conference. Grassroots activists at the conference have been pushing for an unambiguous stance, tabling a motion calling for Labour to campaign ""energetically"" to Remain. But this motion was rejected in a show of hands while a motion setting out the leadership's official position and another endorsing its handling of Brexit were overwhelmingly passed. Len McCluskey said the Labour party trusted their leader After the results were announced by trade union official Wendy Nichols, there were charged scenes in the conference hall. Several delegates called for the votes to be counted individually, suggesting the outcome of the Remain motion was much closer than officials had suggested. One delegate said there had to be an official card vote as ""this is one of the most important decisions Labour is going to take in the next decade"". The result is a major boost for Jeremy Corbyn, who was backed by the majority of Labour's 12 affiliated unions, including Unite and the GMB. Unison had broken ranks with other unions to back the Remain motion. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said he was disappointed by the result of the vote, and that he would campaign for Remain. ""Would I have liked us to have gone a bit further and won that vote? Of course I would - but I don't want to take away from the fact that is quite considerable movement,"" he said.

""What you've seen here is a massive show of support for Jeremy Corbyn,"" he said, adding that it was ""time to unite"". The vote was decisive - the Labour leadership position on Brexit triumphed. Those calling for a more robust Remain stance at the likely snap election were defeated. But the manner of the triumph was immediately called in to question.

Labour in crunch vote on Brexit policy,"This video can not be played There was confusion over the show of hands vote Jeremy Corbyn's policy on Brexit has triumphed at Labour conference, as members endorsed his stance to stay neutral while negotiating a new deal. The party voted against a motion which would have seen Labour backing Remain in any future referendum. But there was confusion as the votes were called, as the chair of the proceedings faced calls for a recount. Labour's position on Brexit has dominated the conference agenda, with huge disagreements over the issue. The party's draft plan for its Brexit policy, put forward by Mr Corbyn, suggests that, if Labour wins power in a general election, it would remain neutral while negotiating a new deal with the EU within three months. Labour tensions on full display Corbyn plays down Labour splits amid aide's exit Where does Labour stand on Brexit? It would then hold a referendum within six months, and the party would decide which side to back ahead of that at a special conference. Grassroots activists at the conference have been pushing for an unambiguous stance, tabling a motion calling for Labour to campaign ""energetically"" to Remain. But this motion was rejected in a show of hands while a motion setting out the leadership's official position and another endorsing its handling of Brexit were overwhelmingly passed. Len McCluskey said the Labour party trusted their leader After the results were announced by trade union official Wendy Nichols, there were charged scenes in the conference hall. Several delegates called for the votes to be counted individually, suggesting the outcome of the Remain motion was much closer than officials had suggested. One delegate said there had to be an official card vote as ""this is one of the most important decisions Labour is going to take in the next decade"". The result is a major boost for Jeremy Corbyn, who was backed by the majority of Labour's 12 affiliated unions, including Unite and the GMB. Unison had broken ranks with other unions to back the Remain motion. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said he was disappointed by the result of the vote, and that he would campaign for Remain. ""Would I have liked us to have gone a bit further and won that vote? Of course I would - but I don't want to take away from the fact that is quite considerable movement,"" he said.

"Thomas Cook latest: Repatriation beginsAll holidays and flights are cancelled after the firm collapses, putting 21,000 jobs at risk.Business","Get in touch: bizlivepage@bbc.co.uk Thomas Cook collapses into liquidation All flights and holidays have been cancelled Repatriation of 150,000 Brits abroad begins Some 21,000 jobs at risk, including 9,000 in the UK Dearbail Jordan, Simon Read and Becky Morton That's it for today. We'll be back from 6am on Tuesday morning.. Do join us then for all the latest breaking news and analysis, including the latest on Thomas Cook. Sam Emerton and his partner Shaylee, from Milton Keynes, arrived in Fuerteventura early Monday morning only to discover that Thomas Cook had collapsed. He told the BBC their hotel is now demanding payment if they want to stay there. We drove to Gatwick at 1:30 in the morning, unbeknown to us that Thomas Cook had collapsed. No-one told us. Our flight landed and we got our bags, only to be greeted by no-one. The Thomas Cook stand was empty.  About half an hour later a woman showed up to tell us Thomas Cook had gone bust, there were no transfers to the hotel and the hotel would not accept us unless we paid 1,211 Euros. We have been paying Â£330 a month since March for this all-inclusive holiday.  We are currently waiting in the hotel for the staff to receive the OK from the CAA that they will be paid. We put them onto the phone with the CAA but at the moment all the hotel is offering is that we can pay for one night and see if the situation is resolved tomorrow.  Are you a former or current Thomas Cook employee? The Money Advice Service has put together some details about where you stand with redundancy and your pension. You'll find it here,external Simon JackBBC Business Editor In the end Thomas Cook was a victim of that serial company killer
â debt. When you owe Â£1.7bn, not much needs to go wrong to tip you
over the edge â and with Thomas Cook a lot had been going wrong. In fact,
Thomas Cook has been struggling for a decade. Mergers with MyTravel and Co-Op
had left it with 1,200 high street stores JUST as consumers were moving online. It had a near death experience in 2011 but was saved when its lenders agreed to
support it during a restructuring that saw it close over 600 bricks and
mortar outlets. Thomas Cookâs basic business model is to buy up package holidays
in bulk months in advance and then sell them on. It's inherently risky as terror
attacks, currency moves, unexpected heatwaves in the UK and uncertainty
about ease of travel and insurance arrangements after Brexit could and
did hit demand leaving the company exposed. In May it announced a loss of Â£1.5bn, pushing it further into debt. Its largest shareholder, the Chinese company
Fosun - which also owns another holiday company, Club Med â offered to plough in Â£450m but the companyâs
lenders didnât think there was enough cash to see it through the lean winter
months. It required another Â£200m and when that couldnât be raised
privately, it turned to the government, which refused, just as it had with contractor Carillion
to prop up a private company with taxpayers' money. Thomas
Cookâs chief executive took home Â£8m in pay and bonuses in the
last four years and there will be an investigation into the conduct of directors.
That will be little comfort to 21,000 Thomas Cook workers who are facing unemployment rather
than a bit of holiday disruption. Passengers flying into Manchester on the last Thomas Cook flight were told how one crew member had been with the airline for 22 years. Flight TCX2643 arrived at Manchester Airport from Orlando at 08:30. Passenger Elizabeth Evans, from Bury, Greater Manchester, was on the flight with her husband Chris. She said: The pilot just kept thanking the staff and the lead hostess thanked the pilot. It's a sad day for them. It was sad to see them crying as we were getting off. One of the staff has done 22 years. Now it's come to this.  This was the ""heartwarming"" note that was posted on a Thomas Cook store in Sheffield earlier. Mark Newby took the photo of the Fargate store in the city centre this afternoon. The message, which appears to have been written by a former customer, thanked staff who had helped them book holidays. It said: ""My heart goes out to those who should be going to work today."" The government has held an emergency Cobra meeting to discuss
its response to the collapse of Thomas Cook. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says the government will be
running a âshadow airlineâ for the next two weeks to repatriate 150,000 Brits. He says the Cobra meeting discussed the governmentâs response, which he says is âon track
so farâ and ârunning smoothlyâ. The first nine replacement aircraft are in the air with passengers, with several thousand passengers due to arrive back in the UK today, he adds. A cross government task force is also being
set up to help the 9,000 employees losing their jobs, Mr Shapps says. He stresses people should not come home early from their holidays but leave the day they had originally planned to, after checking the Thomas Cook website before leaving for the airport. BBC Radio Leicester Ella Waine, a member of Thomas Cookâs cabin crew, says she
only found out the company had collapsed from passengers when the flight from Egypt she
was working on landed in the UK this morning. âWhen we landed a lot of
passengers got their phones out and said, âlook Iâm really sorry but have you
seen the news?â âAnd then it was a complete
heart to the stomach moment, it was like âOh god, itâs actually happened,â the
19-year-old tells the BBC. âThere was so much speculation around it that
we really thought we could pull through with thisâ¦ it was really devastating.â Ella says she is gutted to lose
her âdream jobâ after joining the company in February and staff still donât
know whether they will be paid at the end of the month. âIâm 19-years-old and Iâve been made redundant. That
rarely happens to people my age to be honest so itâs a big shock,â she adds. BBC Radio 5 Live Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Nile Air has said it will fly Thomas Cook customers home after it was
announced that the British travel agent had collapsed. ""Currently, there are
British tourists spending their vacations in [the Red Sea resort of] Marsa Alam
and Nile Air would fly all Thomas Cook customers home from Egyptian airports to
Britain,"" state-owned website Al-Akhbar quoted an Egyptian aviation
official as saying. The
official told the website that Thomas Cook used to fly eight times a month to
Marsa Alam. Meanwhile Jet2.com said its efforts to bring Thomas Cook customers
back home start tonight with a flight from Menorca to East
Midlands. ""We will continue to cooperate with the CAA in the coming days,"" the company said.

This video can not be played Jenny Whitby's daughter has worked for Thomas Cook for 13 years. She is currently on a Thomas Cook holiday in Egypt and faces returning to the UK with no job. If Thomas Cook customers can't get compensation, their insurance may kick in, according to the Association of British Insurers. Mark Shepherd, assistant director, head of general insurance policy, at the ABI, said: Travel insurance policies can provide back up if compensation cannot be accessed from ATOL cover, banks or credit card providers. In the first instance, customers should check their policies on what cover they have. Those with scheduled airline failure or end supplier failure should be able to get compensation for the cost of the flight. Where travel disruption is included, they will be covered for extra costs, such as additional hotel accommodation or the cost of new flights, where these are not recoverable from any other source  Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter While future travellers on
package deals will be covered by ATOL protection, some Thomas Cook customers on
flight-only deals may need to find another route for a refund. That will include making a
claim via their travel insurance company. But analysis by data
information company Defaqto shows that 45% of travel insurance policies do not
cover airline failure. Another 8% require customers to pay extra as it is
optional. For those without cover, the
route will be making a claim via the provider of the credit, or possibly debit,
card they used to pay for it. Holidaymakers relaxing on a Lanzarote beach Connor McKeown, in Lanzarote with his girlfriend, is hoping to get on a flight to Manchester this evening. He told the BBC even getting to the airport could be difficult. I'm sat here on a lovely sunny day, but we're properly in the dark. The CAA have several replacement flights today confirmed within three hours of each other from Lanzarote to the UK. Upwards of 1,200 people are travelling to the airport. We've been to reception and they can't book us a taxi. I can only imagine other people have booked them already.  Â© 2025 BBC.

"French trial on fatal weight-loss drug beginsExperts believe the drug could have killed between 500 and 2,000 people before it was banned.","Mediator was banned after three decades of use A landmark French trial is due to begin to decide whether a diabetes pill prescribed for weight loss was behind the deaths of up to 2,000 people. Servier, the drug's manufacturer, is accused of deceiving users over the killer side effects of a drug later used to treat overweight diabetics. Believed to be one of France's biggest healthcare scandals, the firm is on trial for manslaughter and deceit. Servier has denied the charges, saying it did not lie about the side effects. French health experts believe the drug known as Mediator could have killed anywhere between 500 and 2,000 people before it was finally taken off the market in 2009. The country's state drug regulator, accused of not acting to prevent deaths and injuries, is also on trial. The trial will involve more than 2,600 plaintiffs and 21 defendants, and is expected to run over the course of six months. France braced for diabetic drug scandal report France pledges reform after diabetes drug scandal It will also look into why the drug, which was introduced in 1976, was allowed to sell for so long despite various warnings. Lawyers representing the plaintiffs argue that the drug manufacturer purposely misled patients for decades, and that this was bolstered by lenient authorities. Servier has been accused of profiting at least â¬1bn ($1.1bn, Â£880m) from the drug's sales. ""The trial comes as huge relief. Finally, we are to see the end of an intolerable scandal,""Dr Irene Frachon, a pulmonologist credited with lifting the lid on the side effects, told Reuters news agency,external. Dr Frachon's research drew on medical records across France and concluded that there was a clear pattern of heart valve problems among Mediator users. This prompted many more studies which ultimately led to the drug's ban. One study concluded that 500 deaths could be linked to Mediator between 1976 and 2009. A second one put the figure at 2,000. Those numbers have been disputed by Servier, which has said that there are only three documented cases where death can be clearly attributed to the use of Mediator. In other cases, it says, aggravating factors were at work. Irene Frachon's research concluded a pattern of heart problems among Mediator users Servier has said it will continue to compensate victims and has paid almost â¬132m to patients. ""There is a series of circumstances highlighting how all this took place,"" a lawyer for the drug company told Reuters. Several European countries, like Spain and Italy, banned the drug in the early 2000s. Based on a molecule called benfluorex, Mediator was first developed in 1976 as a lipopenic - a drug to lower fat levels in the blood. Later, it was prescribed to diabetics to help them lose weight. But as its appetite-suppressant properties were recognised, family doctors began offering Mediator as a general treatment. Anyone worried about putting on the pounds could be offered a course of the drug - even though legally it was authorised for diabetics alone. By the time it was taken off the market, it is believed that some five million people had taken Mediator, making it among the 50 most-prescribed drugs in France.

'Torment' after search for Columba McVeigh ends,"Columba McVeigh, 19, from Donaghmore, County Tyrone, was kidnapped in November 1975 The sister of a man who was murdered and secretly buried by the IRA in 1975 has said her family is in ""torment"" after another search for his body has ended without success. Columba McVeigh, 19, from Donaghmore in County Tyrone, was one of 16 murder victims known as the Disappeared, who were killed and secretly buried. A new search for his body in Bragan Bog in County Monaghan ended on Sunday. ""Someone knows where he is,"" his sister Dympna Kerr said. Who were the Disappeared? Timeline: The Disappeared She said: ""It's impossible to describe the continuing pain and torment of another year passing and another search ending with Columba still lying in some desolate unmarked hole in the ground where he was left by his murderers. ""What cause is served by denying an ordinary Catholic family a funeral Mass for over 40 years?"" she added Despite numerous searches, three of the Disappeared have never been found. They areJoe Lynskey,Columba McVeighandCapt Robert Nairac. The search was being undertaken by the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains (ICLVR). On Monday, Archbishop of Armagh Eamon Martin said that he was ""saddened and disappointed"" that the latest search for Columba's body had been unsuccessful. In a statement, he added: ""Columba's family have suffered too much pain, distress and anxiety over the years."" ""I appeal to those carrying long-held secrets, from what were awful, terrible times, to share what information they have."" The most recentsearch took place for the teenager's remains at a section of Bragan Bog last September and was temporarily stopped in November.It recommenced in June. Several previous searches in the bog have failed to uncover his remains. Jon Hill is a senior investigator with the ICLVR Senior investigator with the ICLVR, Jon Hill, said it was a ""bitter blow to the family"". He said that they had done ""absolutely everything (they) could in often difficult circumstances"". ""If Columba had been here we would have found him,"" he added.Â Lead forensic scientist, Geoff Knupfer, said everyone in the republican movement the ICLVR had spoken to had been ""adamant that Columba was buried where they told us he was"". ""We have no reason to believe that we have been deliberately mislead,"" he added. He said there was the ""possibility"" that at some point Mr Veigh's remains had been removed from their original site and buried somewhere else. The search took place at Bragan Bog in County Monaghan ""If he was moved than we need someone who has knowledge of that to come forward,"" he added. In May, it emerged a reward of almost Â£50,000is being offered for new information that results in finding the bodies of the Disappeared. The anonymous donation of $60,000 (Â£47,191) was given to the independent UK charity Crimestoppers. The ICLVR was set up to obtain information that may lead to where the bodies of the Disappeared are buried. Information it receives is strictly confidential and is not passed to other agencies or used in prosecutions. Mr McVeigh's brother Oliver said he was ""devastated"" and ""angry"". ""Angry that people who have information are watching us suffer and are doing nothing,"" he added.

Labour promises four-day working week,"This video can not be played McDonnell: 'We should work to live, not live to work' The average working week in the UK would be cut to 32 hours within 10 years under a Labour government, John McDonnell has announced. This would reduce it to the equivalent of four days - although it would not necessarily mean a day off as other methods could be used to cut hours. The shadow chancellor said the cut could be done with ""no loss of pay"". The average UK full-time working week is 42.5 hours versus an EU average of 41.2,statistics body Eurostat says.,external ""We should work to live, not live to work. As society got richer, we could spend fewer hours at work,"" Mr McDonnell told Labour's annual conference in Brighton. ""But in recent decades progress has stalled, and since the 1980s the link between increasing productivity and expanding free time has been broken. It's time to put that right."" Labour pledged to introduce four new public holidays in their 2017 general election manifesto but did not mention working hours. Do Britons work the longest hours in Europe? Labour vow to 'integrate' private schools Tensions on display as election looms In a wide-ranging speech, Mr McDonnell also vowed to: End the UK's opt out from the EU working time directive, which caps at 48 the number of hours people can work in an average week End the ""modern evil"" of in-work poverty within Labour's first term in office Expand public services free at the point of use including childcare, post-school education, public transport for under-25s and school meals Make personal social care free at the point of use,at an estimated cost of Â£6bn a year Mr McDonnell said negotiations over working hours would be carried out as part of plans to roll out collective bargaining across different industries. Collective bargaining is where wage rates and conditions are agreed between employees and trade unions, a practice that used to be commonplace in British industry. ""We'll require working hours to be included in the legally binding sectoral agreements between employers and trade unions,"" said Mr McDonnell. ""This will allow unions and employers to decide together how best to reduce hours for their sector. ""And we'll set up a Working Time Commission with the power to recommend to government on increasing statutory leave entitlements as quickly as possible without increasing unemployment."" The Working Time Commission would also have the power to increase statutory holiday entitlement, which is currently 28 days. In his speech, Mr McDonnell also defendedthe Labour leadership's Brexit stance,which would see Jeremy Corbyn promise to negotiate a new deal with Brussels and then put it to a referendum, with the party to decide whether it backs Remain or Leave at a special one-day conference nearer the time. He said cancelling Brexit, by revoking Article 50, would send out the wrong message. ""We can't say to people 'Labour wants you to share in the running of your workplace, your community and your environment, but we don't trust you to have the final say over Brexit.'"" The shadow chancellor's proposals for a shorter working week were welcomed by the trade unions. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""It's time for working people to share in the benefits of new technology."" And the national co-ordinator for Labour campaign group Momentum, Laura Parker, said its members were ""delighted"" that a policy they had campaigned for was being adopted. ""This is what a democratic party looks like,"" she said. ""Policy is being written by the movement, with members and the leadership working hand in hand to write the next manifesto and deliver the ambitious, radical policies we need to win the next election."" But CBI director general Carolyn Fairbairn, who represents business, said: ""Who would turn down a four day week on the same pay? But without productivity gains it would push many businesses into loss."" In an average week, the total of all hours worked by the entire workforce is 1.05 billion. If you assumed the workforce remained the same, then this policy would see total hours worked cut by around 100 million hours. In and of itself, it would have a significant effect on the economy. But the opposition argue not just that the policy will not cost the economy, but that individual workers will not get a pay cut. How is such a free lunch, indeed tens of millions of such lunches, possible? It requires an epic increase in productivity, how much each worker actually produces, something that has eluded the UK economy. Business organisations fear that this is the cart before the horse, requiring huge capital investment. The opposition are essentially trying to grab the benefits of a future decade of technological advancements towards workers, rather than business owners.

The report said capping workers' hours to a four-day week would not be ""realistic or even desirable"", citing France's introduction of a 35-hour working week in 1998. ""The evidence is that, after a brief impact effect, France's legislation was rendered broadly ineffective by an accumulation of exceptions and loopholes,"" it said. Labour said its policy would not be a French-style ""cap"" on hours because it would rely on sector-wide agreements rather than enforcement action against individual companies.

"French trial on fatal weight-loss drug beginsExperts believe the drug could have killed between 500 and 2,000 people before it was banned.Europe","Mediator was banned after three decades of use A landmark French trial is due to begin to decide whether a diabetes pill prescribed for weight loss was behind the deaths of up to 2,000 people. Servier, the drug's manufacturer, is accused of deceiving users over the killer side effects of a drug later used to treat overweight diabetics. Believed to be one of France's biggest healthcare scandals, the firm is on trial for manslaughter and deceit. Servier has denied the charges, saying it did not lie about the side effects. French health experts believe the drug known as Mediator could have killed anywhere between 500 and 2,000 people before it was finally taken off the market in 2009. The country's state drug regulator, accused of not acting to prevent deaths and injuries, is also on trial. The trial will involve more than 2,600 plaintiffs and 21 defendants, and is expected to run over the course of six months. France braced for diabetic drug scandal report France pledges reform after diabetes drug scandal It will also look into why the drug, which was introduced in 1976, was allowed to sell for so long despite various warnings. Lawyers representing the plaintiffs argue that the drug manufacturer purposely misled patients for decades, and that this was bolstered by lenient authorities. Servier has been accused of profiting at least â¬1bn ($1.1bn, Â£880m) from the drug's sales. ""The trial comes as huge relief. Finally, we are to see the end of an intolerable scandal,""Dr Irene Frachon, a pulmonologist credited with lifting the lid on the side effects, told Reuters news agency,external. Dr Frachon's research drew on medical records across France and concluded that there was a clear pattern of heart valve problems among Mediator users. This prompted many more studies which ultimately led to the drug's ban. One study concluded that 500 deaths could be linked to Mediator between 1976 and 2009. A second one put the figure at 2,000. Those numbers have been disputed by Servier, which has said that there are only three documented cases where death can be clearly attributed to the use of Mediator. In other cases, it says, aggravating factors were at work. Irene Frachon's research concluded a pattern of heart problems among Mediator users Servier has said it will continue to compensate victims and has paid almost â¬132m to patients. ""There is a series of circumstances highlighting how all this took place,"" a lawyer for the drug company told Reuters. Several European countries, like Spain and Italy, banned the drug in the early 2000s. Based on a molecule called benfluorex, Mediator was first developed in 1976 as a lipopenic - a drug to lower fat levels in the blood. Later, it was prescribed to diabetics to help them lose weight. But as its appetite-suppressant properties were recognised, family doctors began offering Mediator as a general treatment. Anyone worried about putting on the pounds could be offered a course of the drug - even though legally it was authorised for diabetics alone. By the time it was taken off the market, it is believed that some five million people had taken Mediator, making it among the 50 most-prescribed drugs in France.

Corbyn faces battle over Labour Brexit policy,"This video can not be played There was confusion over the show of hands vote Jeremy Corbyn's policy on Brexit has triumphed at Labour conference, as members endorsed his stance to stay neutral while negotiating a new deal. The party voted against a motion which would have seen Labour backing Remain in any future referendum. But there was confusion as the votes were called, as the chair of the proceedings faced calls for a recount. Labour's position on Brexit has dominated the conference agenda, with huge disagreements over the issue. The party's draft plan for its Brexit policy, put forward by Mr Corbyn, suggests that, if Labour wins power in a general election, it would remain neutral while negotiating a new deal with the EU within three months. Labour tensions on full display Corbyn plays down Labour splits amid aide's exit Where does Labour stand on Brexit? It would then hold a referendum within six months, and the party would decide which side to back ahead of that at a special conference. Grassroots activists at the conference have been pushing for an unambiguous stance, tabling a motion calling for Labour to campaign ""energetically"" to Remain. But this motion was rejected in a show of hands while a motion setting out the leadership's official position and another endorsing its handling of Brexit were overwhelmingly passed. Len McCluskey said the Labour party trusted their leader After the results were announced by trade union official Wendy Nichols, there were charged scenes in the conference hall. Several delegates called for the votes to be counted individually, suggesting the outcome of the Remain motion was much closer than officials had suggested. One delegate said there had to be an official card vote as ""this is one of the most important decisions Labour is going to take in the next decade"". The result is a major boost for Jeremy Corbyn, who was backed by the majority of Labour's 12 affiliated unions, including Unite and the GMB. Unison had broken ranks with other unions to back the Remain motion. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said he was disappointed by the result of the vote, and that he would campaign for Remain. ""Would I have liked us to have gone a bit further and won that vote? Of course I would - but I don't want to take away from the fact that is quite considerable movement,"" he said. The leader of the Unite union, Len McCluskey, said the vote showed ordinary members coming behind the Labour leader's stance in a show of loyalty. ""What you've seen here is a massive show of support for Jeremy Corbyn,"" he said, adding that it was ""time to unite"". The vote was decisive - the Labour leadership position on Brexit triumphed. Those calling for a more robust Remain stance at the likely snap election were defeated. But the manner of the triumph was immediately called in to question. The vote wasn't a secret ballot, it was a show of hands. Calls for a card vote - where the vote of each delegate is individually counted in secret - were dismissed by the chair. That's not to say there wasn't clear show of support for the leadership. But some remainers maintain that the vote would at least have been closer if it wasn't conducted in public. That's because the debate  became - for some delegates - a demonstration of support for the leadership, close to an election, rather than a pure test of opinion on Brexit. The conventional wisdom was that Jeremy Corbyn might have to rely on the big unions - with 50% of conference votes - to win. But some unions chose to defy him, making a defeat possible. In the end a section of the grassroots - the ordinary members - did not prioritise their own pro-Remain position and rallied round Jeremy Corbyn. Remainers are now accentuating, for them, the positive - that the party is now unambiguously backing a new referendum, with Remain as an option. Nonetheless, Labour will go in to the election unable to say whether it will officially back leave or remain in a subsequent referendum. But after a difficult few days, most of those close to Jeremy Corbyn are relieved tonight, and some are jubilant. Andrew Lewin, the founder of Remain Labour, said the vote represented the ""grassroots against the party machine - and the machine won"". ""If this fudge is the Labour policy at the next general election, we will drive Remain voters away."" Another campaigner, Michael Chessum, from Another Europe is Possible, said: ""Labour members, 90% of whom want to stay in the EU, will be deeply disappointed with this decision."" Labour's stance on Brexit has dominated the conference But Labour MPs remain divided over the issue. Speaking before the vote, shadow Treasury minister Annaliese Dodds said the economic consequences of Brexit were ""so severe"" that she believed Labour must back remain in another referendum. ""Is it going to be easy?"" she told the BBC's Carolyn Quinn. ""No it is not, because people are passionate in both directions."" But Stephen Kinnock, the MP for Aberavon, told a fringe meeting organised by the Social Market Foundation that Labour had had ""more Brexit positions than the Karma Sutra"". Describing the first two days of conference as an ""utter shambles"", he said Labour should have stuck with its 2017 manifesto pledge to honour the referendum result and moving away from this this would not go down well in Leave constituencies. ""Our position on Brexit is being treated with ridicule on the doorsteps in my constituency,"" he said. Away from Brexit, Labour has announceda pledge to introduce free personal carein England for over-65s, so they will not have to pay for help with dressing, washing and meals. In his speech, Mr McDonnell also pledged to end in-work poverty within five years and tomove to a four day, or 32-hour, working weekwithin a decade without any cut to pay. These are the latest of several new policies likely to feature in the party's next election manifesto, including pledges to: Scrap Ofsted,which it called ""unfit for purpose"", and replace it with a new schools inspections system Make NHS prescriptionsfree in England, bringing it in line with Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland Force large employersto provide flexible working hours to women experiencing symptoms of the menopause Jeremy Corbyn's senior aide to quit Labour vote to 'integrate' private schools Corbyn plays down Labour splits amid aide's exit Labour's Watson urges unity after bid to oust him Labour would replace 'unfit for purpose' Ofsted Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser LA mayor says winds and drought created 'perfect storm', while official hits out at looters Maps and pictures chart how fires have spread Biden praises Carter's character as former president's casket heads to Georgia Why are UK borrowing costs rising and what does it mean for me?

"Thomas Cook latest: Repatriation beginsAll holidays and flights are cancelled after the firm collapses, putting 21,000 jobs at risk.","Get in touch: bizlivepage@bbc.co.uk Thomas Cook collapses into liquidation All flights and holidays have been cancelled Repatriation of 150,000 Brits abroad begins Some 21,000 jobs at risk, including 9,000 in the UK Dearbail Jordan, Simon Read and Becky Morton That's it for today. We'll be back from 6am on Tuesday morning.. Do join us then for all the latest breaking news and analysis, including the latest on Thomas Cook. Sam Emerton and his partner Shaylee, from Milton Keynes, arrived in Fuerteventura early Monday morning only to discover that Thomas Cook had collapsed. He told the BBC their hotel is now demanding payment if they want to stay there. We drove to Gatwick at 1:30 in the morning, unbeknown to us that Thomas Cook had collapsed. No-one told us. Our flight landed and we got our bags, only to be greeted by no-one. The Thomas Cook stand was empty.  About half an hour later a woman showed up to tell us Thomas Cook had gone bust, there were no transfers to the hotel and the hotel would not accept us unless we paid 1,211 Euros. We have been paying Â£330 a month since March for this all-inclusive holiday.  We are currently waiting in the hotel for the staff to receive the OK from the CAA that they will be paid. We put them onto the phone with the CAA but at the moment all the hotel is offering is that we can pay for one night and see if the situation is resolved tomorrow.  Are you a former or current Thomas Cook employee? The Money Advice Service has put together some details about where you stand with redundancy and your pension. You'll find it here,external Simon JackBBC Business Editor In the end Thomas Cook was a victim of that serial company killer
â debt. When you owe Â£1.7bn, not much needs to go wrong to tip you
over the edge â and with Thomas Cook a lot had been going wrong. In fact,
Thomas Cook has been struggling for a decade. Mergers with MyTravel and Co-Op
had left it with 1,200 high street stores JUST as consumers were moving online. It had a near death experience in 2011 but was saved when its lenders agreed to
support it during a restructuring that saw it close over 600 bricks and
mortar outlets. Thomas Cookâs basic business model is to buy up package holidays
in bulk months in advance and then sell them on. It's inherently risky as terror
attacks, currency moves, unexpected heatwaves in the UK and uncertainty
about ease of travel and insurance arrangements after Brexit could and
did hit demand leaving the company exposed. In May it announced a loss of Â£1.5bn, pushing it further into debt. Its largest shareholder, the Chinese company
Fosun - which also owns another holiday company, Club Med â offered to plough in Â£450m but the companyâs
lenders didnât think there was enough cash to see it through the lean winter
months. It required another Â£200m and when that couldnât be raised
privately, it turned to the government, which refused, just as it had with contractor Carillion
to prop up a private company with taxpayers' money. Thomas
Cookâs chief executive took home Â£8m in pay and bonuses in the
last four years and there will be an investigation into the conduct of directors.
That will be little comfort to 21,000 Thomas Cook workers who are facing unemployment rather
than a bit of holiday disruption. Passengers flying into Manchester on the last Thomas Cook flight were told how one crew member had been with the airline for 22 years. Flight TCX2643 arrived at Manchester Airport from Orlando at 08:30. Passenger Elizabeth Evans, from Bury, Greater Manchester, was on the flight with her husband Chris. She said: The pilot just kept thanking the staff and the lead hostess thanked the pilot. It's a sad day for them. It was sad to see them crying as we were getting off. One of the staff has done 22 years. Now it's come to this.  This was the ""heartwarming"" note that was posted on a Thomas Cook store in Sheffield earlier. Mark Newby took the photo of the Fargate store in the city centre this afternoon. The message, which appears to have been written by a former customer, thanked staff who had helped them book holidays. It said: ""My heart goes out to those who should be going to work today."" The government has held an emergency Cobra meeting to discuss
its response to the collapse of Thomas Cook. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says the government will be
running a âshadow airlineâ for the next two weeks to repatriate 150,000 Brits. He says the Cobra meeting discussed the governmentâs response, which he says is âon track
so farâ and ârunning smoothlyâ. The first nine replacement aircraft are in the air with passengers, with several thousand passengers due to arrive back in the UK today, he adds. A cross government task force is also being
set up to help the 9,000 employees losing their jobs, Mr Shapps says. He stresses people should not come home early from their holidays but leave the day they had originally planned to, after checking the Thomas Cook website before leaving for the airport. BBC Radio Leicester Ella Waine, a member of Thomas Cookâs cabin crew, says she
only found out the company had collapsed from passengers when the flight from Egypt she
was working on landed in the UK this morning. âWhen we landed a lot of
passengers got their phones out and said, âlook Iâm really sorry but have you
seen the news?â âAnd then it was a complete
heart to the stomach moment, it was like âOh god, itâs actually happened,â the
19-year-old tells the BBC. âThere was so much speculation around it that
we really thought we could pull through with thisâ¦ it was really devastating.â Ella says she is gutted to lose
her âdream jobâ after joining the company in February and staff still donât
know whether they will be paid at the end of the month. âIâm 19-years-old and Iâve been made redundant. That
rarely happens to people my age to be honest so itâs a big shock,â she adds. BBC Radio 5 Live Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

If Thomas Cook customers can't get compensation, their insurance may kick in, according to the Association of British Insurers. Mark Shepherd, assistant director, head of general insurance policy, at the ABI, said: Travel insurance policies can provide back up if compensation cannot be accessed from ATOL cover, banks or credit card providers. In the first instance, customers should check their policies on what cover they have. Those with scheduled airline failure or end supplier failure should be able to get compensation for the cost of the flight. Where travel disruption is included, they will be covered for extra costs, such as additional hotel accommodation or the cost of new flights, where these are not recoverable from any other source  Kevin PeacheyPersonal finance reporter While future travellers on
package deals will be covered by ATOL protection, some Thomas Cook customers on
flight-only deals may need to find another route for a refund. That will include making a
claim via their travel insurance company. But analysis by data
information company Defaqto shows that 45% of travel insurance policies do not
cover airline failure. Another 8% require customers to pay extra as it is
optional. For those without cover, the
route will be making a claim via the provider of the credit, or possibly debit,
card they used to pay for it. Holidaymakers relaxing on a Lanzarote beach Connor McKeown, in Lanzarote with his girlfriend, is hoping to get on a flight to Manchester this evening.

Greta Thunberg: 'Leaders failed us on climate',"This video can not be played ""You are failing us"" - Greta tells world leaders Swedish campaigner Greta Thunberg has made a passionate speech to world leaders at the UN, accusing them of failing to act on climate change. ""You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,"" she told a UN climate summit in New York. About 60 world leaders are taking part in the one-day meeting organised by UN Secretary General AntÃ³nio Guterres. He earlier said countries could only speak at the summit if they came with action plans to cut carbon emissions. US President Donald Trump, a climate change sceptic, had not been expected at the meeting - but he was briefly spotted in the audience. Greta Thunberg: The Swedish teen inspiring climate strikes Climate change 'accelerating', say scientists Climate change food calculator: What's your diet's carbon footprint? Brazil and Saudi Arabia are among the countries staying away. In an emotional speech, she said: ""This is all wrong. I shouldn't be up here. I should be back in school on the other side of the ocean, yet you all come to us young people for hope. How dare you? ""You have stolen my dreams and my childhood with your empty words,"" the 16-year-old said. And she urged world leaders to act urgently, saying: ""We will be watching you."" This video can not be played The moment Greta Thunberg saw President Donald Trump Mr Guterres, who organised the meeting, said the world was ""in a deep climate hole"" and that urgent action was needed.

This video can not be played BBC Weather examines what effects a warming world could have had on 2019's extreme weather French President Emmanuel Macron said international organisations had pledged to release $500m in additional aid to protect tropical forests. New Zealand's Prime Minister Jacinda Ardern said things ""are starting to turn around"" in the country. ""Our gross emissions peaked in 2006, over 80% of our electricity already comes from renewable hydro and wind, and we have begun an ambitious agenda. ""We have introduced in parliament the zero carbon bill, the purpose of which is to ensure New Zealand lives within the threshold of 1.5C of global warming necessary to avoid catastrophic weather events for our Pacific neighbours."" The summit comes days after several million people took part in a global climate strike led by youth activists. Ahead of the meeting, scientists warned the signs and impacts of global warming were speeding up. The World Meteorological Organization (WMO) saidthe amount of carbon dioxide going into the atmosphere between 2015 and 2019 had grown by 20%,externalcompared with the previous five years. ""We should listen to the loud cry coming from the schoolchildren,"" said Professor Brian Hoskins, chair of the Grantham Institute, Imperial College London, and professor of meteorology at the University of Reading. ""There is an emergency - one for action in both rapidly reducing our greenhouse gas emissions towards zero and adapting to the inevitable changes in climate,"" he said. By Roger Harrabin,  BBC environment analyst As the dangers of climate heating become ever more apparent, so does the absence of collective will to tackle the issue. In 2015 in Paris, all the world's leaders sounded their determination to curb the emissions that were heating the climate. The summit will see a host of initiatives from businesses and small- and medium-sized nations. This video can not be played Millions of people join the environmental strike led by schoolchildren across the world on Friday But President Trump is encouraging fossil fuel use in every way he can. And China - in spite of its trend-setting commitment to solar and wind power -  is still building new coal-fired power stations. Even the UK, a global leader in climate policy-making, is veering away from its own medium-term targets to cut emissions. The government is still aiming to expand Heathrow airport and increase the road network in a way that will increase emissions in those sectors. Politicians appear to believe climate change can be challenged with a version of economic business as usual.

PM refuses to address conflict of interest claims,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson: ""Everything done in the proper way"" Boris Johnson has denied any impropriety following claims he failed to declare a potential conflict of interest while London mayor. The Sunday Times,externalsaid Jennifer Arcuri - who knew Mr Johnson - joined trade missions he led and received thousands of pounds in sponsorship grants. The PM earlier refused address the allegations, but later said ""everything was done entirely in the proper way."" She told the paper it was part of her role as a legitimate businesswoman. Labour has said Mr Johnson must give a full account of his actions, but pressed by journalists during a flight to New York on Sunday night, the now-prime minister refused to comment. On Monday evening, though, he told the BBC's John Pienaar: ""All I can say is I am very proud of what we did as Mayor of London... particularly banging the drum for our city and country around the world."" He added: ""I can tell you that absolutely everything was done entirely in the proper way."" Johnson 'must address conflict of interest claims' Technology entrepreneur Ms Arcuri is believed to have moved to London seven years ago - Mr Johnson was mayor between 2008 and 2016. She joined a joined a number of trade missions led by him while in office, and it is understood she attended events on two of these trips - to New York and Tel Aviv - despite not officially qualifying for them as a delegate. The Sunday Times reported that one of her businesses received Â£10,000 and Â£1,500 in sponsorship money from a mayoral organisation when Mr Johnson was mayor, as well as a Â£15,000 government grant for foreign entrepreneurs to build businesses in Britain. The newspaper also said Ms Arcuri got a Â£100,000 grant from the Department of Culture, Media and Sport earlier this year. The grant was intended for ""English-based"" businesses - although she had moved back to the US in June 2018. The Sunday Times said it had found the registered address on the grant application form was a rented house in the UK and no longer connected to her. The government has confirmed to the BBC it is investigating, but said the funds were awarded to a UK-registered company. Boris Johnson with Jennifer Arcuri at an event in 2014 Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said it was ""perfectly normal"" for entrepreneurs to join trade missions, aimed at promoting British businesses overseas. He told the BBC: ""British companies and entrepreneurs go on trade missions. It's quite right and proper and I'm sure that's exactly what's happened there."" Allow Twitter content?

The current London Mayor, Labour's Sadiq Khan, said he had ordered City Hall officials to look into the allegations. Journalists asked Mr Johnson about the allegations when travelling with him to the UN General Assembly in New York. The PM told reporters he was there to ""talk about what we're doing in the UN and this country's commitment to tackle climate change"", as well as ""the crisis in the Gulf and any other issues that may arise"". Asked again, he replied: ""I'm here to talk exclusively about the work of the UN."" Ms Arcuri was quoted by the Sunday Times as saying: ""Any grants received by my companies and any trade mission I joined were purely in respect of my role as a legitimate businesswoman."" The woman at the centre of this story is Jennifer Arcuri, who describes herself on Twitter as an entrepreneur, cyber security expert and producer. She began her career as a DJ on Radio Disney, before moving into film - where she wrote, produced and directed a short film that went on to be sold at Cannes Film Festival. Ms Arcuri then brought in her tech skills to create a streaming platform for independent film makers. But it was her founding of The Innotech Network in London that saw her path cross with Boris Johnson. The network hosts events to discuss tech policy, and Mr Johnson was the keynote speaker at the first of those in 2012. Since then, Ms Arcuri has also founded another company called Hacker House, which uses ethical hackers to find tech solutions for businesses.

Study assesses alcohol law's effect on homeless,"Last May Scotland became the first country in the world to implement alcohol minimum unit pricing. Glasgow Caledonian University is to lead a study looking at the impact of alcohol minimum pricing on the homeless. Researchers will explore how the legislation has affected drinkers since it came into force. Experts from three universities, including the University of Victoria in Canada, will also take part. Last May Scotland became thefirst country in the worldto implement alcohol minimum unit pricing. Prof Carol Emslie, co-leader of the project, said: ""We need to explore the potential benefits of this policy for homeless people but we also need to understand any potential negative consequences. ""We do not know how vulnerable groups such as people experiencing homeless have adapted to the higher price of alcohol such as vodka and strong white cider. ""Our study will inform decisions about minimum unit pricing in Scotland and provide guidance for other countries planning to introduce the policy."" Prof Carol Emslie hopes to shed light on how homeless people have adapted to the higher price of alcohol, such as vodka and strong white cider The scientists will also work with colleagues at Stirling University and Heriot-Watt University in Edinburgh. It will also be supported by experts from NHS Greater Glasgow and Clyde (NHSGGC) and The Homeless Network. The findings of what will be the first study of its kind will help to inform the Scottish Parliament's consideration of the policy's impacts. Project co-leader Prof Lawrie Elliott said: ""You might think MUP would affect homeless people and street drinkers the most, given they represent the poorest groups in society and tend to consume cheap alcohol. ""However, we don't know this, nor do we know about any unintended consequences of the legislation for example switching to illicit alcohol or drugs.""

Trump confirms he raised Bidens in Ukraine call,"Mr Trump's alleged pressure on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens has dominated headlines US President Donald Trump has defended enquiring about his presidential rival Joe Biden during a call with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Mr Trump denied pressuring Mr Zelensky to look into unsubstantiated corruption allegations against Mr Biden. But accusations that Mr Trump abused his power in raising Mr Biden with a foreign leader have pushed more Democrats towards raising impeachment. A top Democrat said impeaching the president now ""may be the only remedy"". Democrats have accused Mr Trump of threatening to withhold a $250m (Â£200m) aid payment to Ukraine as a means to pressure Mr Zelensky to investigate Mr Biden and his son Hunter. Mr Trump and his allies have claimed that Mr Biden encouraged the firing of Ukraine's top prosecutor because the prosecutor was investigating a company that employed Hunter Biden - a claim which has never been substantiated. ""Of course it's an impeachable offence,"" Democratic congressman Jim Himes told CNN of the president's alleged attempt to pressure Ukraine. ""I can't tell you that the House will move into impeachment mode right away, but this really ups the ante,"" Mr Himes said. President Trump has not provided any evidence of corruption involving Mr Biden or his son, Hunter, and the former vice-president denies any wrongdoing. Pressure is growing on Mr Trump to release a transcript of his phone call with Mr Zelensky. What's the Trump-Ukraine story about? Mr Trump and his allies have been suggesting that Mr Biden, as Barack Obama's vice-president, encouraged the firing of Ukraine's top prosecutor because he had been investigating Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma, which employed Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden became a director at Burisma in 2014, while his father held a key role in US policy towards Ukraine. Mr Biden is currently frontrunner to be the Democrat to take on Mr Trump in the November 2020 presidential election. Why Ukraine has become ensnared in US collusion claims Hunter Biden's Ukrainian gas connection US Air Force orders review over Trump resort stays US media reported last week that an intelligence whistleblower had filed a complaint over Mr Trump's alleged promise to a foreign leader during a call. The US president pressured his Ukrainian counterpart to launch corruption investigations into the Bidens, according to US media reports. Joe Biden's son Hunter (left) was a well-paid director at one of Ukraine's largest energy companies, Burisma It emerged last week that the Trump administration was blocking the whistleblower complaint from being handed over to Congress, despite the intelligence inspector general judging it to be ""urgent"". Under US law,external, if a complaint is considered to be of ""urgent concern"", and if the inspector general considers the complaint to be ""credible"", then the department head is expected to share the information with Congress within seven days. The controversial phone call between the two leaders coincided with the White House's decision to temporarily freeze up to $250m in military aid to Ukraine. The decision to suspend the aid was made before the call on 25 July, US media report, and there has been no indication the package was discussed on that particular phone conversation. Following bipartisan criticism of the aid delay, the administration approved the $250m for Ukraine this month. Mr Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani told Fox Business on Monday that he could not say ""100%"" that the president did not threaten to withhold military aid to Ukraine. Arriving on Monday at the United Nations General Assembly in New York City, Mr Trump insisted there had been no wrongdoing on his call with Mr Zelensky. ""What Biden did was wrong,"" the Republican president added. Asked why his administration had delayed the military aid to Ukraine, Mr Trump added: ""Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?"" Mr Trump told reporters on Sunday that his call with Mr Zelensky had been to congratulate him on his recent election. But Mr Trump also said during the conversation he mentioned corruption and ""largely the fact that we don't want our people, like Vice-President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine"". He insisted he had done ""absolutely nothing wrong"". Mr Trump has previously accused the as-yet-unnamed whistleblower of being ""partisan"" and said he knew all his phone calls to foreign leaders were listened to by US agencies. This video can not be played Trump: ""It's a partisan whistleblower"" While Mr Trump suggested a transcript could be released, senior Trump administration officials said it would be inappropriate for private conversations between world leaders to be made public. The Wall Street Journal has quoted sources as sayingMr Trump had urged Mr Zelensky about eight times to work with his lawyer,externalRudy Giuliani on an investigation into Hunter Biden, but had not offered anything in return. Democrats have said that if Mr Trump asked Mr Zelensky to investigate Mr Biden, it is tantamount to promoting foreign interference in the 2020 election. The US president is due to meet his Ukrainian counterpart on Wednesday, among several other foreign leaders at the UN General Assembly. When Hunter Biden joined Burisma in 2014, questions were raised about a potential conflict of interest for his father. Ukraine was undergoing a political transition after its pro-Russia president was forced out of office, and the elder Biden was making frequent trips to the country. In 2016, Joe Biden pushed the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, whose office had been investigating the oligarch owner of Burisma. Volodymyr Zelensky won a landslide election victory in April In a speech last year at a think tank Mr Biden boasted of having threatened to withhold a billion-dollar loan guarantee to successfully force Mr Shokin out. ""I looked at them and said 'I'm leaving in six hours: if the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money',"" he said. Mr Trump and his allies accuse Mr Biden of having acted to protect his son. However, several western governments and major financers of Ukraine's government also wanted Mr Shokin dismissed because he was seen as a barrier to anti-corruption efforts. Mr Shokin had also shown little appetite for pursuing Burisma. In May this year,Ukraine's then prosecutor general said there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden.,external Joe Biden has said he has never spoken to his son about his business dealings. Democrats have been split on whether they should seek to impeach Mr Trump over alleged wrongdoing. However, this latest story appears to have pushed some senior Democrats closer to backing such a move. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said impeachment ""may be the only remedy"". Mr Schiff has previously resisted calls among rank-and-file Democrats that they attempt to remove the president from office. Biden's record player rambling spoils good debate Who will take on Trump in 2020? House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that if the whistleblower complaint was not turned over to Congress the Trump administration would ""be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation"". Ms Pelosi, like Mr Schiff, has thus far resisted demands for impeachment. Mr Trump was asked by a journalist on Monday how seriously he was taking the threat of impeachment, and he replied: ""Not at all seriously.""

Thomas Cook collapses as rescue talks fail,"This video can not be played Thomas Cook customers react to holiday firm collapse Thomas Cook has collapsed after last-minute negotiations aimed at saving the 178-year-old holiday firm failed. The UK Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) said the tour operator had ""ceased trading with immediate effect"". It has also triggered the biggest ever peacetime repatriation, aimed at bringing more than 150,000 British holidaymakers home. Peter Fankhauser, Thomas Cook's chief executive, said the firm's collapse was a ""matter of profound regret"". Commenting asthe company entered compulsory liquidation,external, Mr Fankhauser also apologised to the firm's ""millions of customers, and thousands of employees"". The tour operator's failure puts 22,000 jobs at risk worldwide, including 9,000 in the UK. One of the world's best-known holiday brands, the business was founded in 1841 in Leicestershire by cabinet-maker Thomas Cook. Passengers are facing queues and disruption, from destinations such as Majorca BBC transport correspondent Tom Burridge said 16,000 holidaymakers were booked to come back on Monday. Authorities hope to get at least 14,000 of them home on chartered flights. The government has chartered 45 jets to bring customers home and they will fly 64 routes on Monday, in an undertaking dubbed Operation Matterhorn. The size of the fleet will make it temporarily the UK's fifth-largest airline. Operators including easyJet and Virgin have supplied some aircraft, with jets coming from as far afield as Malaysia.

Thomas Cook latest: Repatriation begins Thomas Cook: What went wrong? Thomas Cook: Your questions answered 'Planes already being impounded' The BBC understands the government was asked for a bailout of Â£250m, which was denied. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps defended the move on the Today programme. ""I fear it would have kept them afloat for a very short period of time and then we would have been back in the position of needing to repatriate people in any case,"" he said. The company's large debts and High Street-focused business made it a poor candidate for survival, he said. Shadow chancellor John McDonnell told the BBC the government should have bailed out Thomas Cook ""if only to stabilise the situation while a real plan for the future of the company could be addressed"". Prime Minister Boris Johnson pledged to help stranded holidaymakers, but also questioned whether company directors were properly motivated to ""sort such matters out"". Ruth Morse and her fiance Jordan Miller Ruth Morse from Halesowen, West Midlands, was due to marry her partner in Cyprus on 8 October, but now doubts the wedding will go ahead. She booked the whole event through Thomas Cook, including the decorations, the cake, wedding venues and a private bar. And of the 44 guests due to attend, about 25 booked their flights and accommodation through the travel agent. ""At the moment, Thomas Cook have not been in contact, so we are in the dark,"" Ruth says. ""I know we are protected by Atol, but I'm unsure about the things we bought from third parties through Thomas Cook, like the decorations. They cost me Â£4,000."" Ruth says she had planned her ""dream wedding"" for two years. What makes it doubly hard is that much of the money she spent came from family members, including her mother and her late brother Ben, who wasmurderedin 2017. ""From the grief we had, we pulled ourselves together to arrange our dream day,"" she says. ""We will rebook the wedding, but I won't do it abroad again because I have lost faith. I feel completely devastated by all of this."" Are you a Thomas Cook customer or member of staff? If you've been affected by the company's collapse, you can get in touch by emailinghaveyoursay@bbc.co.uk,external. While an estimated 150,000 Britons are affected by Thomas Cook's collapse, the company has a further 350,000 to 450,000 customers abroad. In Germany, one of Thomas Cook's main markets, insurance companies will help organise the response to its collapse. UK customers will be brought home ""as close as possible"" to their booked return date, the Department for Transport (DfT) has said. Check-in desks at UK airports such as Gatwick were closed as dozens of flights have been cancelled Customers will be on special free flights or booked on to another scheduled airline at no extra cost, withdetails of each flight to be posted on a dedicated website,externalas soon as they are available. The DfT added that a ""small number"" of passengers might need to book their own flight home and reclaim the costs. Customers have been urged not to cut short their holiday or go to the airport without checking the website for more information about their return journey. The CAA is also contacting hotels accommodating Thomas Cook customers, who have booked as part of a package, to tell them the cost of their accommodation will be covered by the government, through the Air Travel Trust Fund and Air Travel Organiser's Licence scheme (Atol). This video can not be played Travel expert Simon Calder on the collapse of ""the mightiest brand in travel"" Tim Johnson, policy director of the CAA, told BBC News that customers whose future holidays had been cancelled would be informed of how they could claim a refund on thewebsite,external. Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom has said she will write to the Insolvency Service urging them to ""fast-track"" their investigation into the circumstances which caused the company to go into liquidation. The DfT said the investigation would also consider the conduct of the directors.  22,000jobs at risk worldwide 9,000jobs at risk in the UK 150,000British holidaymakers to be repatriated 450,000customers affected internationally 34 planesowned (Airbus A321 and A330) For now, Thomas Cook's Indian, Chinese, German and Nordic subsidiaries will continue to trade as normal. This is because, from a legal standpoint, they are considered separate to the UK parent company and are not under the jurisdiction of the UK's Official Receiver. They do, however, share services - such as aircraft and IT - with their parent company and will need to strike rescue deals in the coming weeks to keep trading. If they fail, a further 350,000 to 450,000 customers could be affected. Thomas Cook had secured a Â£900m rescue deal led by its largest shareholder Chinese firm Fosun in August, but a recent demand from its banks to raise a further Â£200m in contingency funding had put the deal in doubt. Fosun said in a statement: ""We extend our deepest sympathy to all those affected by this outcome."" The holiday company spent all of Sunday in talks with lenders trying to secure the additional funding and salvage the deal, but to no avail. Thomas Cook has blamed a series of issues for its problems, including political unrest in holiday destinations such as Turkey, last summer's prolonged heatwave and customers delaying booking holidays because of Brexit. Speaking to BBC News from Manchester airport, travel expert Simon Calder said Thomas Cook ""wasn't ready for the 21st Century"". ""Now everybody can pretend they are a travel agent. They've got access to all the airline seats, hotel beds, car rentals in the world and they can put things together themselves. Mr Calder, travel editor at The Independent, added that planes at the airport began to be impounded shortly after 00:00 BST. While the company was closing shops to try to cut costs -  closing 21 in March - it still had more than 500 outlets, bringing large costs compared with online competitors. In another sign of its slow progress in mending its finances, it only stopped dividend payments to investors in November. If you are on a package holiday, you are covered by the Atol scheme. The scheme will pay for your accommodation abroad, although you may have to move to a different hotel or apartment. Atol will also pay to have you brought home if the airline is no longer operating. If you have a holiday booked in the future, you will also be refunded by the scheme. If you have booked a flight-only deal, you will need to apply to your travel insurance company or credit card and debit card provider to seek a refund. When Monarch Airlines collapsed in 2017, the government organised to bring home all the stranded passengers, whether they were covered by Atol or not.

Corbyn faces battle over Labour Brexit policyMembers at the party's annual conference will choose between backing Remain or staying neutral.UK Politics,"This video can not be played There was confusion over the show of hands vote Jeremy Corbyn's policy on Brexit has triumphed at Labour conference, as members endorsed his stance to stay neutral while negotiating a new deal. The party voted against a motion which would have seen Labour backing Remain in any future referendum. But there was confusion as the votes were called, as the chair of the proceedings faced calls for a recount. Labour's position on Brexit has dominated the conference agenda, with huge disagreements over the issue. The party's draft plan for its Brexit policy, put forward by Mr Corbyn, suggests that, if Labour wins power in a general election, it would remain neutral while negotiating a new deal with the EU within three months. Labour tensions on full display Corbyn plays down Labour splits amid aide's exit Where does Labour stand on Brexit? It would then hold a referendum within six months, and the party would decide which side to back ahead of that at a special conference. Grassroots activists at the conference have been pushing for an unambiguous stance, tabling a motion calling for Labour to campaign ""energetically"" to Remain. But this motion was rejected in a show of hands while a motion setting out the leadership's official position and another endorsing its handling of Brexit were overwhelmingly passed. Len McCluskey said the Labour party trusted their leader After the results were announced by trade union official Wendy Nichols, there were charged scenes in the conference hall. Several delegates called for the votes to be counted individually, suggesting the outcome of the Remain motion was much closer than officials had suggested. One delegate said there had to be an official card vote as ""this is one of the most important decisions Labour is going to take in the next decade"". The result is a major boost for Jeremy Corbyn, who was backed by the majority of Labour's 12 affiliated unions, including Unite and the GMB. Unison had broken ranks with other unions to back the Remain motion. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said he was disappointed by the result of the vote, and that he would campaign for Remain. ""Would I have liked us to have gone a bit further and won that vote? Of course I would - but I don't want to take away from the fact that is quite considerable movement,"" he said. The leader of the Unite union, Len McCluskey, said the vote showed ordinary members coming behind the Labour leader's stance in a show of loyalty. ""What you've seen here is a massive show of support for Jeremy Corbyn,"" he said, adding that it was ""time to unite"". The vote was decisive - the Labour leadership position on Brexit triumphed. Those calling for a more robust Remain stance at the likely snap election were defeated. But the manner of the triumph was immediately called in to question. The vote wasn't a secret ballot, it was a show of hands. Calls for a card vote - where the vote of each delegate is individually counted in secret - were dismissed by the chair. That's not to say there wasn't clear show of support for the leadership. But some remainers maintain that the vote would at least have been closer if it wasn't conducted in public. That's because the debate  became - for some delegates - a demonstration of support for the leadership, close to an election, rather than a pure test of opinion on Brexit. The conventional wisdom was that Jeremy Corbyn might have to rely on the big unions - with 50% of conference votes - to win. But some unions chose to defy him, making a defeat possible. In the end a section of the grassroots - the ordinary members - did not prioritise their own pro-Remain position and rallied round Jeremy Corbyn. Remainers are now accentuating, for them, the positive - that the party is now unambiguously backing a new referendum, with Remain as an option. Nonetheless, Labour will go in to the election unable to say whether it will officially back leave or remain in a subsequent referendum. But after a difficult few days, most of those close to Jeremy Corbyn are relieved tonight, and some are jubilant. Andrew Lewin, the founder of Remain Labour, said the vote represented the ""grassroots against the party machine - and the machine won"". ""If this fudge is the Labour policy at the next general election, we will drive Remain voters away."" Another campaigner, Michael Chessum, from Another Europe is Possible, said: ""Labour members, 90% of whom want to stay in the EU, will be deeply disappointed with this decision."" Labour's stance on Brexit has dominated the conference But Labour MPs remain divided over the issue.

Corbyn faces battle over Labour Brexit policyMembers at the party's annual conference will choose between backing Remain or staying neutral.,"This video can not be played There was confusion over the show of hands vote Jeremy Corbyn's policy on Brexit has triumphed at Labour conference, as members endorsed his stance to stay neutral while negotiating a new deal. The party voted against a motion which would have seen Labour backing Remain in any future referendum. But there was confusion as the votes were called, as the chair of the proceedings faced calls for a recount. Labour's position on Brexit has dominated the conference agenda, with huge disagreements over the issue. The party's draft plan for its Brexit policy, put forward by Mr Corbyn, suggests that, if Labour wins power in a general election, it would remain neutral while negotiating a new deal with the EU within three months. Labour tensions on full display Corbyn plays down Labour splits amid aide's exit Where does Labour stand on Brexit? It would then hold a referendum within six months, and the party would decide which side to back ahead of that at a special conference. Grassroots activists at the conference have been pushing for an unambiguous stance, tabling a motion calling for Labour to campaign ""energetically"" to Remain. But this motion was rejected in a show of hands while a motion setting out the leadership's official position and another endorsing its handling of Brexit were overwhelmingly passed. Len McCluskey said the Labour party trusted their leader After the results were announced by trade union official Wendy Nichols, there were charged scenes in the conference hall. Several delegates called for the votes to be counted individually, suggesting the outcome of the Remain motion was much closer than officials had suggested. One delegate said there had to be an official card vote as ""this is one of the most important decisions Labour is going to take in the next decade"". The result is a major boost for Jeremy Corbyn, who was backed by the majority of Labour's 12 affiliated unions, including Unite and the GMB. Unison had broken ranks with other unions to back the Remain motion. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said he was disappointed by the result of the vote, and that he would campaign for Remain. ""Would I have liked us to have gone a bit further and won that vote? Of course I would - but I don't want to take away from the fact that is quite considerable movement,"" he said. The leader of the Unite union, Len McCluskey, said the vote showed ordinary members coming behind the Labour leader's stance in a show of loyalty. ""What you've seen here is a massive show of support for Jeremy Corbyn,"" he said, adding that it was ""time to unite"". The vote was decisive - the Labour leadership position on Brexit triumphed. Those calling for a more robust Remain stance at the likely snap election were defeated. But the manner of the triumph was immediately called in to question. The vote wasn't a secret ballot, it was a show of hands. Calls for a card vote - where the vote of each delegate is individually counted in secret - were dismissed by the chair. That's not to say there wasn't clear show of support for the leadership. But some remainers maintain that the vote would at least have been closer if it wasn't conducted in public. That's because the debate  became - for some delegates - a demonstration of support for the leadership, close to an election, rather than a pure test of opinion on Brexit. The conventional wisdom was that Jeremy Corbyn might have to rely on the big unions - with 50% of conference votes - to win. But some unions chose to defy him, making a defeat possible. In the end a section of the grassroots - the ordinary members - did not prioritise their own pro-Remain position and rallied round Jeremy Corbyn. Remainers are now accentuating, for them, the positive - that the party is now unambiguously backing a new referendum, with Remain as an option. Nonetheless, Labour will go in to the election unable to say whether it will officially back leave or remain in a subsequent referendum. But after a difficult few days, most of those close to Jeremy Corbyn are relieved tonight, and some are jubilant. Andrew Lewin, the founder of Remain Labour, said the vote represented the ""grassroots against the party machine - and the machine won"". ""If this fudge is the Labour policy at the next general election, we will drive Remain voters away."" Another campaigner, Michael Chessum, from Another Europe is Possible, said: ""Labour members, 90% of whom want to stay in the EU, will be deeply disappointed with this decision."" Labour's stance on Brexit has dominated the conference But Labour MPs remain divided over the issue. Speaking before the vote, shadow Treasury minister Annaliese Dodds said the economic consequences of Brexit were ""so severe"" that she believed Labour must back remain in another referendum. ""Is it going to be easy?"" she told the BBC's Carolyn Quinn. ""No it is not, because people are passionate in both directions."" But Stephen Kinnock, the MP for Aberavon, told a fringe meeting organised by the Social Market Foundation that Labour had had ""more Brexit positions than the Karma Sutra"".

British stars among surprise winners at Emmys,"This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Killing Eve star Jodie Comer were among the big British winners at this year's Emmy Awards. The ceremony, which recognises excellence in television, took place in Los Angeles on Sunday. Comer won best leading drama actress for playing Villanelle inKilling Eve. Fleabagstar and writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge took home the prize for best leading comedy actress, best comedy series and best comedy writing. Originally made for BBC Three, it is the first British-made show to be named best comedy series. ""It's so wonderful and reassuring to know that a dirty, pervy, angry and messed-up woman can make it to the Emmys,"" Waller-Bridge laughed, referring to the show's lead character. 6 highlights from the Emmys ceremony In pictures: The Emmys red carpet Emmy Awards: The winners and nominees How America fell in love with Fleabag Waller-Bridge also joked that the possibility of winning awards was the reason she wrote the series in the first place. ""I find writing really hard and really painful, but I'd like to say from the bottom of my heart that the reason that I do it isthis,"" she said, holding up the Emmy statuette. ""So it's made it all really worth it guys, thank you so much."" Game of Thrones won the night's most prestigious prize - best drama - despite the eighth and final series receiving a mixed response from fans and critics. One of the HBO fantasy's stars, Peter Dinklage, also took home the prize for best supporting drama actor. Jodie Comer paid tribute to her Killing Eve co-star Sandra Oh Waller-Bridge's win for leading comedy actress was a particular surprise, given that she was nominated against Emmy favourite Julia Louis-Dreyfus. The US actress has previously won in this category six times for her role in Veep, and was widely expected to win again for the show's seventh and final series. Comer's win for her performance as the ruthless assassin Villanelle in BBC America's Killing Eve tops off an extraordinary year for the actress, who also won a TV Bafta in May for the same role. Why Killing Eve's star Jodie Comer 'confuses people' Fleabag: Six things to know about the original play ""I was not expecting to get up on this stage tonight,"" Comer said as she picked up her prize. ""I cannot believe I'm in a category alongside these women, one of them who is my co-star Sandra Oh. ""Safe to say Sandra that this Killing Eve journey has been an absolute whirlwind and I feel so lucky to have shared the whole experience with you."" As Waller-Bridge took to the stage near the end of the ceremony to accept Fleabag's fourth award of the night, for best comedy series, she commented: ""This is getting ridiculous! ""Fleabag started as a one-woman show at the Edinburgh festival in 2014, and the journey has been absolutely mental to get here."" Ben Whishaw was among the other British winners Paying tribute to Fleabag's ""hot priest"", she added: ""Season two would not have exploded in the way that it did if it wasn't for Andrew Scott, who came into our Fleabag world like a whirlwind and gave a performance of such depth and complexity it elevated the whole thing."" The show's director, Harry Bradbeer, won best director for a comedy series. ""For a director, something like Fleabag only comes along once in your life,"" he said. ""Thank you Phoebe for coming into my life like some kind of glorious grenade. Scientists are still trying to work out how someone so incredibly talented can be so utterly lovely."" The second series of Fleabag aired on the BBC earlier this year and has been released by Amazon in the US. Bandersnatch writers Annabel Jones and Charlie Brooker Other British winners include Ben Whishaw, who won best supporting actor in a limited series for his role in BBC One's A Very English Scandal. He played Norman Scott, the man who accused Liberal leader Jeremy Thorpe of trying to have him killed. Charlie Brooker won best television movie for Netflix's Bandersnatch, a win he said he was ""quite unprepared for"". The interactive Bandersnatch allowed viewers to choose the way the film's storyline unfolded. In his speech, Brooker thanked his two children, joking: ""I can never limit your video game screen time again, if I do I'm a disgusting hypocrite [because] it sometimes pays off."" British writer Jesse Armstrong, whose work on HBO's Succession won him best writing for a drama series, made reference to the strong UK showing at the ceremony. ""Quite a lot of British winners, maybe too many? Maybe you should have a think about those immigration restrictions,"" he joked.

Trump confirms he raised Bidens in Ukraine callThe admission fuelled calls for Democrats to launch impeachment proceedings against the president.US & Canada,"Mr Trump's alleged pressure on Ukraine to investigate the Bidens has dominated headlines US President Donald Trump has defended enquiring about his presidential rival Joe Biden during a call with the Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky. Mr Trump denied pressuring Mr Zelensky to look into unsubstantiated corruption allegations against Mr Biden. But accusations that Mr Trump abused his power in raising Mr Biden with a foreign leader have pushed more Democrats towards raising impeachment. A top Democrat said impeaching the president now ""may be the only remedy"". Democrats have accused Mr Trump of threatening to withhold a $250m (Â£200m) aid payment to Ukraine as a means to pressure Mr Zelensky to investigate Mr Biden and his son Hunter. Mr Trump and his allies have claimed that Mr Biden encouraged the firing of Ukraine's top prosecutor because the prosecutor was investigating a company that employed Hunter Biden - a claim which has never been substantiated. ""Of course it's an impeachable offence,"" Democratic congressman Jim Himes told CNN of the president's alleged attempt to pressure Ukraine. ""I can't tell you that the House will move into impeachment mode right away, but this really ups the ante,"" Mr Himes said. President Trump has not provided any evidence of corruption involving Mr Biden or his son, Hunter, and the former vice-president denies any wrongdoing. Pressure is growing on Mr Trump to release a transcript of his phone call with Mr Zelensky. What's the Trump-Ukraine story about? Mr Trump and his allies have been suggesting that Mr Biden, as Barack Obama's vice-president, encouraged the firing of Ukraine's top prosecutor because he had been investigating Ukrainian natural gas company Burisma, which employed Hunter Biden. Hunter Biden became a director at Burisma in 2014, while his father held a key role in US policy towards Ukraine. Mr Biden is currently frontrunner to be the Democrat to take on Mr Trump in the November 2020 presidential election. Why Ukraine has become ensnared in US collusion claims Hunter Biden's Ukrainian gas connection US Air Force orders review over Trump resort stays US media reported last week that an intelligence whistleblower had filed a complaint over Mr Trump's alleged promise to a foreign leader during a call. The US president pressured his Ukrainian counterpart to launch corruption investigations into the Bidens, according to US media reports. Joe Biden's son Hunter (left) was a well-paid director at one of Ukraine's largest energy companies, Burisma It emerged last week that the Trump administration was blocking the whistleblower complaint from being handed over to Congress, despite the intelligence inspector general judging it to be ""urgent"". Under US law,external, if a complaint is considered to be of ""urgent concern"", and if the inspector general considers the complaint to be ""credible"", then the department head is expected to share the information with Congress within seven days. The controversial phone call between the two leaders coincided with the White House's decision to temporarily freeze up to $250m in military aid to Ukraine. The decision to suspend the aid was made before the call on 25 July, US media report, and there has been no indication the package was discussed on that particular phone conversation. Following bipartisan criticism of the aid delay, the administration approved the $250m for Ukraine this month. Mr Trump's lawyer Rudy Giuliani told Fox Business on Monday that he could not say ""100%"" that the president did not threaten to withhold military aid to Ukraine. Arriving on Monday at the United Nations General Assembly in New York City, Mr Trump insisted there had been no wrongdoing on his call with Mr Zelensky. ""What Biden did was wrong,"" the Republican president added. Asked why his administration had delayed the military aid to Ukraine, Mr Trump added: ""Why would you give money to a country that you think is corrupt?"" Mr Trump told reporters on Sunday that his call with Mr Zelensky had been to congratulate him on his recent election. But Mr Trump also said during the conversation he mentioned corruption and ""largely the fact that we don't want our people, like Vice-President Biden and his son, creating to the corruption already in the Ukraine"". He insisted he had done ""absolutely nothing wrong"". Mr Trump has previously accused the as-yet-unnamed whistleblower of being ""partisan"" and said he knew all his phone calls to foreign leaders were listened to by US agencies. This video can not be played Trump: ""It's a partisan whistleblower"" While Mr Trump suggested a transcript could be released, senior Trump administration officials said it would be inappropriate for private conversations between world leaders to be made public. The Wall Street Journal has quoted sources as sayingMr Trump had urged Mr Zelensky about eight times to work with his lawyer,externalRudy Giuliani on an investigation into Hunter Biden, but had not offered anything in return. Democrats have said that if Mr Trump asked Mr Zelensky to investigate Mr Biden, it is tantamount to promoting foreign interference in the 2020 election. The US president is due to meet his Ukrainian counterpart on Wednesday, among several other foreign leaders at the UN General Assembly. When Hunter Biden joined Burisma in 2014, questions were raised about a potential conflict of interest for his father. Ukraine was undergoing a political transition after its pro-Russia president was forced out of office, and the elder Biden was making frequent trips to the country. In 2016, Joe Biden pushed the Ukrainian government to fire its top prosecutor, Viktor Shokin, whose office had been investigating the oligarch owner of Burisma. Volodymyr Zelensky won a landslide election victory in April In a speech last year at a think tank Mr Biden boasted of having threatened to withhold a billion-dollar loan guarantee to successfully force Mr Shokin out. ""I looked at them and said 'I'm leaving in six hours: if the prosecutor is not fired, you're not getting the money',"" he said. Mr Trump and his allies accuse Mr Biden of having acted to protect his son. However, several western governments and major financers of Ukraine's government also wanted Mr Shokin dismissed because he was seen as a barrier to anti-corruption efforts. Mr Shokin had also shown little appetite for pursuing Burisma. In May this year,Ukraine's then prosecutor general said there was no evidence of wrongdoing by Joe or Hunter Biden.,external Joe Biden has said he has never spoken to his son about his business dealings. Democrats have been split on whether they should seek to impeach Mr Trump over alleged wrongdoing. However, this latest story appears to have pushed some senior Democrats closer to backing such a move. Adam Schiff, the Democratic chairman of the House Intelligence Committee, said impeachment ""may be the only remedy"". Mr Schiff has previously resisted calls among rank-and-file Democrats that they attempt to remove the president from office. Biden's record player rambling spoils good debate Who will take on Trump in 2020? House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said that if the whistleblower complaint was not turned over to Congress the Trump administration would ""be entering a grave new chapter of lawlessness which will take us into a whole new stage of investigation"". Ms Pelosi, like Mr Schiff, has thus far resisted demands for impeachment. Mr Trump was asked by a journalist on Monday how seriously he was taking the threat of impeachment, and he replied: ""Not at all seriously.""

Brit Awards 'will review' male and female prizes,"The awards will be under review The Brit Awards say they will review the way they distribute prizes, with one option being the abolition of separate male and female categories. But reports that gendered awards have already been axed are ""based on rumour and speculation"", organisers said. ""We can 100% confirm that there will be male and female awards in the UK and international categories in February 2020,"" they told the BBC. The statement was issued aftera story in The Sunday Times,externalat the weekend. The paper said organisers wanted to accommodate non-binary artists - who identify as neither male nor female - and that scrapping gender-specific categories was a likely outcome. The report came a week after pop starSam Smith asked fans to call them by the pronouns ""they/them"", not ""he/him"". ""After a lifetime of being at war with my gender I've decided to embrace myself for who I am, inside and out,""they wrote on Instagram. Sam Smith has won three Brit Awards - although none of them were in the best male category Many other artists have rejected the traditional constraints of gender, including Christine + The Queens, King Princess, Kim Petras, Sophie and Anohni (formerly Antony and the Johnsons). But the Brit Awards would not be the first ceremony to scrap separate male and female prizes. A brief history of gender neutral pronouns The National Television Awards (NTAs) first changed its best actor and actress categories to best drama performance and best serial drama performance in 2008; and the Grammys scrapped male and female awards in 2012. In 2017, the MTV Movie Awards also went gender neutral, with Emma Watson becoming the first recipient of its ""best movie performance"" prize. In her acceptance speech, the Harry Potter star praised the decision to merge the categories. ""With acting, you put yourself in someone else's shoes,"" she said. ""The only distinction should be between each outstanding performance."" But rumours of the Brit Awards shake-up prompted an outburst from Good Morning Britain host Piers Morgan, who accused organisers of ""wrecking"" their reputation. Piers Morgan was not happy ""I suspect what will happen is male performers will end up winning all of the awards than the women. The whole point of having the gender categories is to make it fair and equal, now we're going the other way and that apparently is progress. I think it's a load of nonsense."" However, the history of the MTV Music Awards suggests otherwise. Since they replaced separate best male and best female prizes with an overall best artist award in 2017, the winners have been Ed Sheeran, Camila Cabello and Ariana Grande. At the National TV Awards, the best drama performance prize has been shared equally between men and women, with recipients including David Tennant, Richard Madden, Suranne Jones and Sheridan Smith. Organised by trade body the British Phonographic Industry (BPI), the Brits have awarded prizes along gender lines since their inception in 1977. Although that will not change next year, Award organisers did concede there would be ""significant changes"" that would ""involve more music and some category changes"".

Thomas Cook: Your questions answered,"Thomas Cook has collapsed, triggering the biggest ever peacetime repatriation aimed at bringing more than 150,000 British holidaymakers home. The company, its customers and staff had hoped for a rescue deal, but now that last hope has gone, they will be looking at the practicalities for the near future. About 800,000 British people had future bookings and the company had 9,000 employees in the UK. Anyone who has bought a package holiday will be covered by theAir Travel Organiser's Licence scheme (Atol),external. You would have received an Atol certificate when you booked. This means you will not be going away, but the cost of the holiday will be refunded. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) will be launching an online service to manage all refunds on Monday, 7 October. It has asked people not to submit anything to the CAA before then. The CAA said all refunds should be processed within two months of a claim form being submitted properly. Customers who were paying by direct debit should be refunded within 14 days, The majority of Thomas Cook holidays are packages. Stating the obvious, everything that was paid for as part of the package - such as flights, accommodation, and excursions - will be refunded. Some holidaymakers might have paid separately for airport parking or car hire while away. In this situation, they would need to make a claim from their travel insurer for the cost. In more extreme cases, such as a wedding, there may be a host of other things that could be affected. Specialist cover, such as wedding insurance, may be the only route for those left out of pocket. No. Holidaymakers with package deals get a refund, as that is what the Atol protection states. Booking a new holiday in the very near future might have got more expensive. Some other operators which used Thomas Cook flights will try to switch their customers to an alternative at no extra cost. Others may be on cruises organised and paid through Thomas Cook. It is best to contact those operators directly as they will be prepared to explain the status of the holiday. The Atol protection covers packages, not flight-only deals. So that means you would not get an automatic refund. The main alternative is claiming a refund from the provider of the credit or debit card you used, so-called section 75 rules. Otherwise you may need to make a claim on travel insurance. That is why it is always advised to buy travel insurance at the same time as booking a holiday. Analysis by data company Defaqto shows that 45% of travel insurance policies do not cover the collapse of an airline, so not everyone will be covered. A spokesman for the Association of British Insurers says: ""As a last resort, travel insurance with scheduled airline failure cover can cover the cost of a flight when the airline has gone into administration. A travel insurance policy with travel disruption cover will cover the cost of new travel arrangements."" Thomas Cook collapses as last-ditch rescue talks fail Thomas Cook latest: Repatriation begins Thomas Cook: What went wrong? There may be a little more protection if the hotel you booked was linked to the flight, such as a click-through when booking the flight. That could be covered by the Atol scheme. Anyone who bought a Thomas Cook package that did not include a flight may be covered under the separate Abta scheme. At the moment, enjoy your break as much as you can - do not cut it short. That said, the repatriation operation will only run up to and including Sunday 6 October. After that, travellers would have to make their own plans, although those covered by Atol will be refunded. Hoteliers will be paid via the Atol scheme, so they should not ask for any extra payment from holidaymakers. UK package holiday customers will be brought home ""as close as possible"" to their booked return date, the Department for Transport (DfT) has said. They must take their original ticket information with them and will be issued with a fresh boarding card for their flight. Customers will be on special free flights or booked on to another scheduled airline at no extra cost, with details of each flight to beposted on a dedicated CAA website,externalas soon as they are available, up to 72 hours before its scheduled departure. The CAA said some people might be flown to different UK airports from the ones originally scheduled, but free transfers would be provided. The DfT added that a ""small number"" of passengers might need to book their own flight home and reclaim the costs. Thomas Cook had 600,000 customers on holiday from around the world, including more than 150,000 from the UK, so it will be a huge logistical challenge. When the Monarch airline collapsed, there were arguments fora better repatriation system,external, but nothing has been implemented as yet. It looks like any direct debit to Thomas Cook is pointless, but most people will not need to cancel it. If a direct debit is due to be taken on Tuesday, then you should cancel it straight away with your bank, according to banking trade body UK Finance. Any payments from other customers at a later date will not be processed owing to the insolvency. Any money that has been paid towards a package holiday already should be refunded via the Atol scheme, so you will need to make a claim for it in due course. The same is true of a deposit. Nothing is clear on that yet. It is highly likely that gift cards or vouchers will be worthless, consumer experts say. It will depend on what happens to the company - whether it is rekindled and whether any vouchers would then be honoured. If they are useless, then the person who bought it might be able to make a claim to their credit card provider if it was a generous gift of more than Â£100, or their debit card provider for less. There is better news for those with a pre-paid Thomas Cook currency card, as any funds held on that are protected separately from the company, so will not be lost. Thomas Cook ran domesticticket and hotel packages for sporting events. As the business has ceased trading, they would no longer be valid, although anyone with trips planned could try contacting the destination direct. For example, Thomas Cook would have sold 360 hospitality packages for home matches at Liverpool football club's Anfield ground. ""We are currently assessing the impact of Thomas Cook ceasing trading and the impact for those supporters who have purchased packages from Thomas Cook. Once we have those details from Thomas Cook, we will update supporters,"" the football club said. Some people had booked travel and tickets for the forthcoming American football games in London through Thomas Cook. The NFL said it was investigating and would give further information soon. As most people would not have any insurance cover for such a trip, a refund claim would probably have to be made to the provider of the credit or debit card used to pay. While customers will be worried about their holidays, staff will be heartbroken about their livelihoods. Staff are being informed about what has happened to their jobs, with written confirmation to follow. A group of special managers, from accountancy firm KPMG, have been appointed and will contact staff with a case reference number which will allow them tomake a claim for redundancy payments,external. The Pension Protection Fund (PPF) should step in to protect the more than 13,000 members of Thomas Cook's four pension schemes. Workers who are over the age of their normal retirement will get full benefits, while those who have not yet reached normal retirement age will be paid 90% of their promised pension, up to a cap of Â£40,000. Members with bigger pensions will get at least 50% of their old age pensions, under PPF rules. Meanwhile, the 3,000 or so retired members of Thomas Cook's pension schemes will continue to have their pensions paid in full by the trustees. Were you a member of staff at Thomas Cook?

Trump praises Modi at âhistoricâ Texas rally,"This video can not be played Modi to Trump: ""My honour to introduce you to my family"" US President Donald Trump and Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi exchanged warm words of friendship in Texas at a rare mass rally for a foreign leader. Around 50,000 people gathered for what Mr Trump called a ""profoundly historic event"" on Sunday in Houston. The ""Howdy, Modi!"" event was billed as one of the largest ever receptions of a foreign leader in the US. Mr Modi, however, may face a frostier reception at the UN General Assembly. He is likely to face criticism over tensions in Indian-administered Kashmir, which he stripped of its special status last month, promising to restore the region to its ""past glory"". The region has been in lockdown for more than a month with thousands of activists, politicians and business leaders detained. Trade talks and the UN General Assembly are on the Indian prime minister's agenda during his week-long visit to the United States. Pakistani Prime Minister Imran Khan, who has been the most vocal international leader to oppose India's Kashmir move, is also in the US for the UN conference. Like Mr Modi, he will have a one-on-one meeting with Mr Trump on the sidelines of the summit. Why Trump appearance signals importance of India New York gives star treatment to Indian PM Modi Modi: The Hindu foot soldier who became PM A 90-minute show, featuring 400 performers, warmed up the crowd before Mr Modi and Mr Trump shared the stage. ""I'm so thrilled to be here in Texas with one of America's greatest, most devoted and most loyal friends, Prime Minister Modi of India,"" Mr Trump told the crowd. Narendra Modi and Donald Trump leave the stage holding hands at Houston's NRG Stadium In his speech, Mr Modi said India has a ""true friend"" in the White House, describing Mr Trump as ""warm, friendly, accessible, energetic and full of wit"". ""From CEO to commander-in-chief, from boardrooms to the Oval Office, from studios to the global stageâ¦ he has left a lasting impact everywhere,"" Mr Modi said. Brajesh Upadhyay, BBC News, Houston This was exactly the kind of crowd size and energy President Trump loves at his rallies. Only here the chants were for Indian Prime Minister Narendra Modi and Mr Trump was the superstar invited to the party. But the crowd did not disappoint him either and greeted him with chants of ""USA!"", most heard at Trump rallies. The personal-touch diplomacy with Mr Modi's trademark bear hugs was played to perfection. This rally has been called a win-win for both the leaders. For President Trump, it was a chance to court Indian-Americans for the 2020 presidential election race where Texas could emerge as a battleground state. For Mr Modi, a PR triumph and picture with the president of the United States may help him shrug off the criticism over his recent strong-arm polices at home. Houston's NRG Stadium, where the event was hosted, was the first stop for Mr Modi, whose Hindu nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) won a landslide victory in this year's Indian elections. India's Kashmir move: Two perspectives Modi vows to 'restore' Kashmir's 'past glory' Greeted by a standing ovation, Mr Trump used his speech to heap praise on Mr Modi, who he said was doing a ""truly exceptional job for India"" and its people. Mr Trump also paid tribute to the Indian-American community, telling them ""we are truly proud to have you as Americans"". The US has a population of about 4 million Indians who are seen as an increasingly important vote bank in the country. Apart from Mr Trump, organisers also invited Democrats to the event - House Majority Leader Steny Hoyer was among those who spoke. The 2010 US census shows that Texas is home to the fourth-largest Indian-American population in the country after California, New York and New Jersey. Analysis of voting patterns shows the community tends overwhelmingly to support the Democrat party. The event, dubbed ""Howdy, Modi!"", was attended by an estimated 50,000 people No stranger to nationalist rhetoric himself, Mr Trump compared security at the US-Mexico border to the tensions between India and Pakistan in the tinderbox Kashmir region. ""Both India and US also understand that to keep our communities safe, we must protect our borders,"" Trump said. In India, the rally was closely watched, with most mainstream media outlets running live news updates of what was transpiring on stage. The event had been making headlines for days before as well. On Twitter, many people shared instant analysis and opinions of what was taking place on the stage with the sentiment being overwhelmingly positive. Many praised Mr Modi for what they saw as his statesmanship and diplomatic acumen with a lot of praise coming in for the US president as well. Allow Twitter content?

"'Torment' after search for Columba McVeigh endsMr McVeigh, from Donaghmore in County Tyrone, is one of 16 murder victims known as the Disappeared.Northern Ireland","Columba McVeigh, 19, from Donaghmore, County Tyrone, was kidnapped in November 1975 The sister of a man who was murdered and secretly buried by the IRA in 1975 has said her family is in ""torment"" after another search for his body has ended without success. Columba McVeigh, 19, from Donaghmore in County Tyrone, was one of 16 murder victims known as the Disappeared, who were killed and secretly buried. A new search for his body in Bragan Bog in County Monaghan ended on Sunday. ""Someone knows where he is,"" his sister Dympna Kerr said. Who were the Disappeared? Timeline: The Disappeared She said: ""It's impossible to describe the continuing pain and torment of another year passing and another search ending with Columba still lying in some desolate unmarked hole in the ground where he was left by his murderers. ""What cause is served by denying an ordinary Catholic family a funeral Mass for over 40 years?"" she added Despite numerous searches, three of the Disappeared have never been found. They areJoe Lynskey,Columba McVeighandCapt Robert Nairac. The search was being undertaken by the Independent Commission for the Location of Victims' Remains (ICLVR). On Monday, Archbishop of Armagh Eamon Martin said that he was ""saddened and disappointed"" that the latest search for Columba's body had been unsuccessful. In a statement, he added: ""Columba's family have suffered too much pain, distress and anxiety over the years."" ""I appeal to those carrying long-held secrets, from what were awful, terrible times, to share what information they have."" The most recentsearch took place for the teenager's remains at a section of Bragan Bog last September and was temporarily stopped in November.It recommenced in June. Several previous searches in the bog have failed to uncover his remains. Jon Hill is a senior investigator with the ICLVR Senior investigator with the ICLVR, Jon Hill, said it was a ""bitter blow to the family"". He said that they had done ""absolutely everything (they) could in often difficult circumstances"". ""If Columba had been here we would have found him,"" he added.Â Lead forensic scientist, Geoff Knupfer, said everyone in the republican movement the ICLVR had spoken to had been ""adamant that Columba was buried where they told us he was"". ""We have no reason to believe that we have been deliberately mislead,"" he added. He said there was the ""possibility"" that at some point Mr Veigh's remains had been removed from their original site and buried somewhere else. The search took place at Bragan Bog in County Monaghan ""If he was moved than we need someone who has knowledge of that to come forward,"" he added. In May, it emerged a reward of almost Â£50,000is being offered for new information that results in finding the bodies of the Disappeared. The anonymous donation of $60,000 (Â£47,191) was given to the independent UK charity Crimestoppers. The ICLVR was set up to obtain information that may lead to where the bodies of the Disappeared are buried. Information it receives is strictly confidential and is not passed to other agencies or used in prosecutions. Mr McVeigh's brother Oliver said he was ""devastated"" and ""angry"". ""Angry that people who have information are watching us suffer and are doing nothing,"" he added.

British stars among surprise winners at the Emmys,"This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons Fleabag creator Phoebe Waller-Bridge and Killing Eve star Jodie Comer were among the big British winners at this year's Emmy Awards.

Fleabagstar and writer Phoebe Waller-Bridge took home the prize for best leading comedy actress, best comedy series and best comedy writing. Originally made for BBC Three, it is the first British-made show to be named best comedy series.

""I find writing really hard and really painful, but I'd like to say from the bottom of my heart that the reason that I do it isthis,"" she said, holding up the Emmy statuette. ""So it's made it all really worth it guys, thank you so much."" Game of Thrones won the night's most prestigious prize - best drama - despite the eighth and final series receiving a mixed response from fans and critics. One of the HBO fantasy's stars, Peter Dinklage, also took home the prize for best supporting drama actor. Jodie Comer paid tribute to her Killing Eve co-star Sandra Oh Waller-Bridge's win for leading comedy actress was a particular surprise, given that she was nominated against Emmy favourite Julia Louis-Dreyfus. The US actress has previously won in this category six times for her role in Veep, and was widely expected to win again for the show's seventh and final series. Comer's win for her performance as the ruthless assassin Villanelle in BBC America's Killing Eve tops off an extraordinary year for the actress, who also won a TV Bafta in May for the same role.

""I cannot believe I'm in a category alongside these women, one of them who is my co-star Sandra Oh.

The show's director, Harry Bradbeer, won best director for a comedy series. ""For a director, something like Fleabag only comes along once in your life,"" he said. ""Thank you Phoebe for coming into my life like some kind of glorious grenade. Scientists are still trying to work out how someone so incredibly talented can be so utterly lovely.""

In his speech, Brooker thanked his two children, joking: ""I can never limit your video game screen time again, if I do I'm a disgusting hypocrite [because] it sometimes pays off."" British writer Jesse Armstrong, whose work on HBO's Succession won him best writing for a drama series, made reference to the strong UK showing at the ceremony. ""Quite a lot of British winners, maybe too many? Maybe you should have a think about those immigration restrictions,"" he joked.

Thomas Cook has been struggling for a decade. Mergers with MyTravel and Co-Op

support it during a restructuring that saw it close over 600 bricks and

in bulk months in advance and then sell them on. It's inherently risky as terror

did hit demand leaving the company exposed. In May it announced a loss of Â£1.5bn, pushing it further into debt. Its largest shareholder, the Chinese company
Fosun - which also owns another holiday company, Club Med â offered to plough in Â£450m but the companyâs
lenders didnât think there was enough cash to see it through the lean winter
months. It required another Â£200m and when that couldnât be raised
privately, it turned to the government, which refused, just as it had with contractor Carillion
to prop up a private company with taxpayers' money. Thomas
Cookâs chief executive took home Â£8m in pay and bonuses in the
last four years and there will be an investigation into the conduct of directors.
That will be little comfort to 21,000 Thomas Cook workers who are facing unemployment rather
than a bit of holiday disruption. Passengers flying into Manchester on the last Thomas Cook flight were told how one crew member had been with the airline for 22 years. Flight TCX2643 arrived at Manchester Airport from Orlando at 08:30. Passenger Elizabeth Evans, from Bury, Greater Manchester, was on the flight with her husband Chris. She said: The pilot just kept thanking the staff and the lead hostess thanked the pilot. It's a sad day for them. It was sad to see them crying as we were getting off. One of the staff has done 22 years. Now it's come to this.  This was the ""heartwarming"" note that was posted on a Thomas Cook store in Sheffield earlier. Mark Newby took the photo of the Fargate store in the city centre this afternoon. The message, which appears to have been written by a former customer, thanked staff who had helped them book holidays. It said: ""My heart goes out to those who should be going to work today."" The government has held an emergency Cobra meeting to discuss
its response to the collapse of Thomas Cook. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps says the government will be
running a âshadow airlineâ for the next two weeks to repatriate 150,000 Brits. He says the Cobra meeting discussed the governmentâs response, which he says is âon track
so farâ and ârunning smoothlyâ. The first nine replacement aircraft are in the air with passengers, with several thousand passengers due to arrive back in the UK today, he adds. A cross government task force is also being
set up to help the 9,000 employees losing their jobs, Mr Shapps says. He stresses people should not come home early from their holidays but leave the day they had originally planned to, after checking the Thomas Cook website before leaving for the airport. BBC Radio Leicester Ella Waine, a member of Thomas Cookâs cabin crew, says she
only found out the company had collapsed from passengers when the flight from Egypt she
was working on landed in the UK this morning. âWhen we landed a lot of
passengers got their phones out and said, âlook Iâm really sorry but have you

her âdream jobâ after joining the company in February and staff still donât
know whether they will be paid at the end of the month. âIâm 19-years-old and Iâve been made redundant. That

If Thomas Cook customers can't get compensation, their insurance may kick in, according to the Association of British Insurers.

In the first instance, customers should check their policies on what cover they have.

package deals will be covered by ATOL protection, some Thomas Cook customers on
flight-only deals may need to find another route for a refund. That will include making a
claim via their travel insurance company. But analysis by data
information company Defaqto shows that 45% of travel insurance policies do not
cover airline failure. Another 8% require customers to pay extra as it is
optional. For those without cover, the
route will be making a claim via the provider of the credit, or possibly debit,
card they used to pay for it. Holidaymakers relaxing on a Lanzarote beach Connor McKeown, in Lanzarote with his girlfriend, is hoping to get on a flight to Manchester this evening.

What's gone wrong?,"It's been a long journey for travel firm Thomas Cook since its formation in rural Leicestershire during the early Victorian era. Founded in Market Harborough in 1841 by businessman Thomas Cook, the fledgling company organised railway outings for members of the local temperance movement. Some 178 years later, it had grown to a huge global travel group, with annual sales of Â£9bn, 19 million customers a year and 22,000 staff operating in 16 countries. Thomas Cook had a chequered history, including being nationalised in 1948 - when it became part of the state-owned British Railways - and owning the raucous Club 18-30 youth brand, which it recently closed after failing to find a buyer. However, just as the travel world had progressed from temperance day trips, so the modern business and leisure market was also changing, and at a far faster pace than in previous decades. Thomas Cook collapses as rescue talks fail Thomas Cook: Your questions answered The firm's fate was sealed by a number of factors: financial, social and even meteorological. As well as weather issues, and stiff competition from online travel agents and low-cost airlines, there were other disruptive factors, including political unrest around the world. In addition, many holidaymakers had become used to putting together their own holidays and not using travel agents. ""The company has had troubled for a long time,"" said John Strickland, an aviation analyst who provided evidence toa government inquiry into the 2017 collapse of low-cost airline Monarch,external. As for Thomas Cook's recent attempts to restructure itself, ""it looked to me very much like too little too late,"" he said, adding that a move into the package holiday market by low-cost carriers EasyJet and Jet2 piled on the pressure. Tim Jeans, a former managing director of Monarch who left long before its collapse, told BBC 5 live Thomas Cook had ""an analogue business model in a digital world"". Now chairman of Newquay Airport, in Cornwall, Mr Jeans was an executive at MyTravel, which owned AirTours and was bought by Thomas Cook in 2008, an investment that was recently written off. Much of the value of the business was perceived to be in its brand and the loyalty of its customers, accounted for in its books as goodwill. The firm had very little in the way of tangible assets, such as planes or hotels. So, when customers left for online competitors or to book their own flights and hotels, the value of the firm plummeted, said Mr Jeans. Thomas Cook's airline had 94 planes Last summer, shares in Thomas Cook were trading at just below 150p. But aftera series of profit warnings, the price had fallen to just a fraction of that. Earlier this year,analysts at Citigroup bank described the travel firm's shares as ""worthless"". In May, Thomas Cook reported a Â£1.5bn loss for the first half of its financial year, with Â£1.1bn of the loss caused by the decision to write down the value of My Travel, the business it merged with in 2007. However, it warned of ""further headwinds"" for the rest of the year and said there was ""now little doubt"" that Brexit had caused customers to delay their summer holiday plans. The company then put its airline up for sale in an attempt to raise badly-needed funds. Thomas Cook later announcedit was in advanced talks with its banks and largest shareholder, China's Fosun. The troubled operator hoped to seal a rescue led by Fosun, but the creditor banks issued a last-minute demand that the travel company find an extra Â£200m, which it was unable to do. 2018's summer heatwave in the UK was blamed for falling bookings The company's boss, Peter Fankhauser, said the firm had ""worked exhaustively"" to salvage the rescue package and it was ""deeply distressing"" that it could not be saved. He and other executives received millions of pounds in bonuses, salary and other perks to retain their talents. Investors, lenders and staff may be wondering precisely how wisely this largesse was calculated. For Thomas Cook's unfortunate staff, customers and shareholders, history has come full circle. Eight years ago, the company lurched perilously close to the edge of insolvency after trading turned sour. It was pulled back from the brink by an emergency loan from a group of banks, led by Royal Bank of Scotland - ironically the same bank whose demand for extra money appears to have sunk the company this time. As well as weak trading, the company's big problem in 2011 was too much debt - about Â£2bn when the pension deficit was included. It tried to put its borrowing problem behind it in 2013, with a Â£425m fundraising from shareholders. Fast forward six years and Thomas Cook is back where it was. All the rescue money is gone and the debt pile is back to Â£1.6bn. Again it has been thumped by poor trading and a series of one-offs, notably weak sterling and a summer heatwave that led to a downturn in demand. But there is evidence of deeper problems, as well as a lack of management control. The company stopped paying dividends to shareholders in 2011 as the previous crisis hit, but resumed them in 2017 and again last year - an odd thing to do if trading, and solvency, was tight. The company's results were marked by exceptional, one-off items, always a red flag for analysts, while the negotiations over the restructuring plan have been chaotic. After the immediate repatriation and staff problems have been resolved, one question remains: will Thomas Cook live on in some form? The obvious buyer would be Fosun, the Chinese conglomerate that was the British company's largest shareholder.

Customers 'will not be stranded',"This video can not be played Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab says that people ""will not be stranded"" if Thomas Cook collapses The government is ready to fly holidaymakers back to the UK if tour operator Thomas Cook collapses, Foreign Secretary Dominic Raab has said. Mr Raab told the BBC's Andrew Marr Show contingency planning was in place to make sure no-one would be stranded. But he dampened hopes of a government rescue bid for the firm. Ministers did not ""systematically step in"" when businesses went under unless there was ""a good strategic national interest"", he said. Mr Raab said he did not want to undermine the rescue talks that Thomas Cook is currently conducting with its biggest shareholder and creditors in the City of London. What's gone wrong at Thomas Cook? We were held 'hostage' at hotel, say  customers Thomas Cook clients fear ruined weddings and trips The tour operator's financial difficulties have mounted over the past year, culminating in a refinancing plan in August led by its biggest shareholder, Chinese company Fosun. But banks now want the company to raise extra funds and it could fall into administration within days unless it finds Â£200m. The Civil Aviation Authority (CAA) has aircraft on standby in case Thomas Cook does go into administration over night. The BBC understands that those aircraft are currently being flown to destinations so that British tourists can be flown home on Monday if necessary. A source said the CAA is ""very prepared"". The Transport Salaried Staffs Association (TSSA) union, which represents Thomas Cook staff, isurging the government to step in with a bail outamid fears the company's collapse could leave about 150,000 British tourists stranded. Thomas Cook customers have been reminded on social media that they have Atol protection - a fund paid for through industry levies - ""in the event that Thomas Cook goes into administration"". The travel firm also reassured customers on Sunday that flights continue to operate as normal. Katie Prescott, business correspondent This meeting is crucial for Thomas Cook's survival. If there is no agreement, then the decision to wind up the company will be taken at a board meeting this evening. It's likely (looking at the precedent of Monarch's collapse) that any announcement about that will be made late at night, once all planes are on the ground. But the company doesn't have to announce anything until the markets open at 07:00 BST on Monday. It's low season at the moment, the time of year when Thomas Cook has to pay its suppliers for the busy summer season just gone. Hoteliers are paid on 60 to 90-day terms, once travellers have already taken their holidays. The nightmare scenario is that hoteliers who don't think they will get paid might turn out the people staying with them. However, it is worth re-stating that the company is still trading. People are still holidaying with Thomas Cook. And while we can assume the company is reining back marketing activity around last-minute deals and offers, until any announcement is made, it is business as usual. The foreign secretary said he did not want talk of contingency planning to become ""a self-fulfilling prophecy"". He told the BBC the government had learned lessons from the collapse of the Monarch airline in 2017. The UK's consular authorities abroad were ready to assist, he said. Thomas Cook has hundreds of High Street stores A government spokesperson described the situation as a ""worrying time for holidaymakers and employees"". They added: ""The financial circumstances of individual businesses are a commercial matter, but the government and the Civil Aviation Authority are monitoring the situation closely."" Why Thomas Cook might struggle to book a bailout Thomas Cook: MP calls for 'leadership' Liz Preston says they cheered when her plane landed in Palma As Thomas Cook customers anxiously wait to see if and how their holidays might be affected, some say they have already found themselves in ""horrible"" situations abroad. Customers at a hotel in Tunisia say they were prevented from leaving the propertyon Saturday unless they paid extra fees  - thousands of pounds in some cases - to cover what the resort says it is owed by the tour operator. In Majorca, it's a different story. Liz Preston said there were cheers when her plane took off from Gatwick. ""It was a moment that captured the sheer relief really, that we could still have a holiday, as well as the fact that it might be one of the last ever flights,"" she said. The Thomas Cook staff were in reassurance mode, urging customers to enjoy their holiday, but advising them to keep an eye on the news if the situation changes and their return flight becomes difficult. Richard Stevens regularly travels with Thomas Cook Richard Stevens from Faversham in Kent said he's ""gutted"" Thomas Cook is in such trouble, because he's been coming on Thomas Cook package holidays with his wife and two sons for ""donkey's years"". The domino effect of Thomas Cook's collapse on this holiday island would be significant. Hundreds of smaller industries rely on the through-flow of Thomas Cook travellers for excursion tours, water sports, as well as cafes and bars. Caledonia Tours is a company that offers sightseeing trips. Tour operator Lucas Pantone says 80% of his business is from Thomas Cook. ""If it goes under"" he says, ""we'll be having a crisis meeting within hours, over whether we can survive"". We were held 'hostage', say Thomas Cook customers There are currently 600,000 Thomas Cook customers on holiday, of which 150,000 to 160,000 are British. One of the world's largest travel companies, Thomas Cook was founded in 1841 to operate temperance day trips, and now has annual sales of Â£9bn. It employs 22,000 staff, 9,000 of whom are in the UK, and serves 19 million customers a year in 16 different countries. In July,Thomas Cook produced a business plansaying that it needed Â£900m in refinancing, up from a previous estimate of Â£150m. The Â£900m would come from China's Fosun, the group of creditors and some other investors. The group of lenders then commissioned an independent investigation. Its financial advisers said Thomas Cook would require an additional Â£200m on top of the Â£900m already required, which would bring the total refinancing needed up to Â£1.1bn. Thomas Cook succeeded in finding a backer to provide the additional Â£200m, but the BBC understands it has since pulled out. The firm has blamed a series of problems for its profit warnings, including political unrest in holiday destinations such as Turkey, last summer's prolonged heatwave and customers delaying booking holidays because of Brexit. Brian Strutton, the general secretary of the British Airline Pilots Association, said: ""Ministers need to step forward and take responsibility for the sake of passengers and staff. ""There is a real risk that if the worst comes to the worst proper arrangements may not be in place for the repatriation programme and staff are still working while not knowing if they have a job or will even get paid for this month."" Shadow business secretary Rebecca Long Bailey said ""the government must consider stepping in and taking an equity stake to avoid this crisis"". If you are on a package holiday you are covered by the Air Travel Organiser's Licence scheme (Atol). The scheme will pay for your accommodation abroad, although you may have to move to a different hotel or apartment. Atol will also pay to have you brought home if the airline is no longer operating. If you have holiday booked in the future you will also be refunded by the scheme. If you have booked a flight-only deal you will need to apply to your travel insurance company or credit card and debit card provider to seek a refund. When Monarch Airlines collapsed in 2017, the government organised to bring home all the stranded passengers, whether they were covered by Atol or not.

Much-loved brand with humble roots,"""Don't just book it - Thomas Cook it!"" is a phrase etched in the British memory. Over the years one of the world's best known holiday brands has taken millions of holidaymakers around the world, responding to technological advances in transport and social trends. Its history is also the history of how we have spent our holidays and explored an increasingly accessible world. ""There's an incredible fondness"" for the brand, says travel commentator Emma Coulthurst. ""We have grown up with it. ""You would go into your local travel agent, get your brochures, look at your brochures and go back again as a family. It was an event, booking was part of the whole experience."" Although it is now best known for its trips abroad, when cabinet-maker Thomas Cook founded the business in Leicestershire in 1841 it was for more local excursions. A former Baptist preacher, he wanted to offer working class people a form of educational entertainment to divert them from drinking which he saw as at the root of Victorian social ills. Thomas Cook thought railway trips could be used for social reform; an advert for an early excursion, right He harnessed the UK's newly built railways to offer his first 12 mile trip from Leicester to Loughborough, at the cost of a shilling per head (around Â£3in today's money),external. Those travelling were so-called ""temperance supporters"" - supporting the prohibition of alcohol. The visit was such a success that Thomas Cook repeated it over several summers on behalf of Sunday schools which laid the foundations for the business. By 1855, after having pioneered trips around the British Isles and to London's Great Exhibition, Thomas Cook set his sights across the Channel to Paris where the International Exhibition was being held. His commercial tour there, linked to other European destinations, was a huge success. More European trips followed, and before long Thomas Cook was taking travellers to America, Asia and the Middle East. Early adverts for trips, including Liverpool to New York in 1866 for 25 guineas, about Â£1,552 in today's money The company flourished, fuelled by the growing middle classes and their desire to travel. Thomas' son, John Mason Cook, eventually took over running the company from his father, who died in 1892. It stayed in family hands and, in the first quarter of the 20th Century, Thomas Cook's grandsons added winter sports, motor car tours and commercial air travel to its offerings. At the end of the 1920s it changed hands for the first of many times when the grandsons unexpectedly sold the business to the Belgian owner of the Orient Express. But as World War Two broke out, it was nationalised by the British government as part of British Railways, to save it from the Nazi occupation. The post-war years were characterised by a holiday boom in the UK. For Thomas Cook, this meant taking holidaymakers on package holidays abroad but also to its Welsh holiday camp in Prestatyn. ""I see them as a pioneer in organised travel,"" says Ms Coulthurst, from holiday price comparison website TravelSupermarket, describing how people went on package holidays as children and later as adults with their own families. ""They were in all of the main package holiday destinations."" The Going Places travel brand was merged into Thomas Cook in 2007 before being killed off But competition from other businesses also grew. Thomas Cook was taken private in the 1970s and expanded its network of High Street travel shops through a string of acquisitions. Then in 1992 it was bought by Germany's third largest bank, the Westdeutsche Landesbank. Thomas Cook's airline business was founded in 1999. Its next owner in 2001 was another German company, C&N Touristic AG, which quickly rebranded the whole business as Thomas Cook.  And in 2007 the company merged with MyTravel - owner of the Airtours and Going Places brands - and became known as the Thomas Cook Group. More acquisitions of shops and travel businesses, including websites, continued across the world. Thomas Cook's Indian, Chinese, German and Nordic subsidiaries continued to trade as normal in the immediate aftermath of the collapse of their parent company. Through its long history, it is the 21st Century that the company has found hardest to adapt to. The digital age has seen a revolution in travel. The internet and the rise of budget airlines have made holidays cheaper and more accessible than ever before. The package holiday remained popular, but customers are extremely price sensitive - and Thomas Cook's profit margins were slim. The Thomas Cook brand expanded all over the world, including in India Its history left it with expensive overheads - hundreds of shops and thousands of staff. Acquisitions left it with high debt levels, and little ability to respond to the headwinds of the travel market. Hurricanes, heatwaves and currency fluctuations have hit the company hard over the last few years. ""I think the reasons are very complex,"" says Amie Keeley, the head of news at Travel Weekly. She cites some ""questionable decisions"" years ago, when the company was under a different management and decided to expand its shop network at a time when more people were going online. ""In the short term, last summer's extended heatwave was a big reason. And they have also cited Brexit saying consumers are less confident,"" she said. Thomas Cook offered a complete holiday ""package"" of travel, accommodation and food in 1855 Ms Coulthurst says UK travellers are still booking package holidays, which gives them financial protection through the government-run Atol scheme. ""However a lot of them are booking them in different ways now,"" she adds. ""Thomas Cook has 560 travel agents on the high street, it used to have more. That's bricks and mortar, they have overheads."" She says Thomas Cook was left competing with low-cost airlines as well as rivals with a big online presence, and says: ""But [Thomas Cook's] online presence isn't as strong. They are seen as a predominantly high street shop business."" She also says in North Africa - where Thomas Cook has an ""extremely strong package holiday presence"" - there has been political unrest, such asthe ban on flights to Egypt's Sharm El-Sheikh,which has affected the tour operator. But Thomas Cook has retained a dedicated following, taking 19 million people from the UK and other countries on holiday each year. ""It's an iconic travel brand that has been in existence for 178 years,"" says Ms Keeley from Travel Weekly, adding it is ""much-loved"" both by consumers and those in the travel industry. Even the company's competitors did not want to see Thomas Cook collapse, she adds, not just because of the wider impact on the industry but also from an ""emotional and heritage point of view"". ""A lot of people have worked for Thomas Cook or work with them, so everyone is rooting for them."" For its loyal customers and for its 22,000 staff members, the company has stayed true to its roots - democratising travel and in the words of Thomas Cook himself making it ""a social idea"".

What's gone wrong at Thomas Cook?,"It's been a long journey for travel firm Thomas Cook since its formation in rural Leicestershire during the early Victorian era. Founded in Market Harborough in 1841 by businessman Thomas Cook, the fledgling company organised railway outings for members of the local temperance movement. Some 178 years later, it had grown to a huge global travel group, with annual sales of Â£9bn, 19 million customers a year and 22,000 staff operating in 16 countries. Thomas Cook had a chequered history, including being nationalised in 1948 - when it became part of the state-owned British Railways - and owning the raucous Club 18-30 youth brand, which it recently closed after failing to find a buyer. However, just as the travel world had progressed from temperance day trips, so the modern business and leisure market was also changing, and at a far faster pace than in previous decades. Thomas Cook collapses as rescue talks fail Thomas Cook: Your questions answered The firm's fate was sealed by a number of factors: financial, social and even meteorological. As well as weather issues, and stiff competition from online travel agents and low-cost airlines, there were other disruptive factors, including political unrest around the world. In addition, many holidaymakers had become used to putting together their own holidays and not using travel agents. ""The company has had troubled for a long time,"" said John Strickland, an aviation analyst who provided evidence toa government inquiry into the 2017 collapse of low-cost airline Monarch,external. As for Thomas Cook's recent attempts to restructure itself, ""it looked to me very much like too little too late,"" he said, adding that a move into the package holiday market by low-cost carriers EasyJet and Jet2 piled on the pressure. Tim Jeans, a former managing director of Monarch who left long before its collapse, told BBC 5 live Thomas Cook had ""an analogue business model in a digital world"". Now chairman of Newquay Airport, in Cornwall, Mr Jeans was an executive at MyTravel, which owned AirTours and was bought by Thomas Cook in 2008, an investment that was recently written off. Much of the value of the business was perceived to be in its brand and the loyalty of its customers, accounted for in its books as goodwill. The firm had very little in the way of tangible assets, such as planes or hotels. So, when customers left for online competitors or to book their own flights and hotels, the value of the firm plummeted, said Mr Jeans. Thomas Cook's airline had 94 planes Last summer, shares in Thomas Cook were trading at just below 150p. But aftera series of profit warnings, the price had fallen to just a fraction of that. Earlier this year,analysts at Citigroup bank described the travel firm's shares as ""worthless"". In May, Thomas Cook reported a Â£1.5bn loss for the first half of its financial year, with Â£1.1bn of the loss caused by the decision to write down the value of My Travel, the business it merged with in 2007. However, it warned of ""further headwinds"" for the rest of the year and said there was ""now little doubt"" that Brexit had caused customers to delay their summer holiday plans. The company then put its airline up for sale in an attempt to raise badly-needed funds. Thomas Cook later announcedit was in advanced talks with its banks and largest shareholder, China's Fosun. The troubled operator hoped to seal a rescue led by Fosun, but the creditor banks issued a last-minute demand that the travel company find an extra Â£200m, which it was unable to do. 2018's summer heatwave in the UK was blamed for falling bookings The company's boss, Peter Fankhauser, said the firm had ""worked exhaustively"" to salvage the rescue package and it was ""deeply distressing"" that it could not be saved. He and other executives received millions of pounds in bonuses, salary and other perks to retain their talents. Investors, lenders and staff may be wondering precisely how wisely this largesse was calculated. For Thomas Cook's unfortunate staff, customers and shareholders, history has come full circle. Eight years ago, the company lurched perilously close to the edge of insolvency after trading turned sour. It was pulled back from the brink by an emergency loan from a group of banks, led by Royal Bank of Scotland - ironically the same bank whose demand for extra money appears to have sunk the company this time. As well as weak trading, the company's big problem in 2011 was too much debt - about Â£2bn when the pension deficit was included. It tried to put its borrowing problem behind it in 2013, with a Â£425m fundraising from shareholders. Fast forward six years and Thomas Cook is back where it was. All the rescue money is gone and the debt pile is back to Â£1.6bn. Again it has been thumped by poor trading and a series of one-offs, notably weak sterling and a summer heatwave that led to a downturn in demand. But there is evidence of deeper problems, as well as a lack of management control. The company stopped paying dividends to shareholders in 2011 as the previous crisis hit, but resumed them in 2017 and again last year - an odd thing to do if trading, and solvency, was tight. The company's results were marked by exceptional, one-off items, always a red flag for analysts, while the negotiations over the restructuring plan have been chaotic. After the immediate repatriation and staff problems have been resolved, one question remains: will Thomas Cook live on in some form? The obvious buyer would be Fosun, the Chinese conglomerate that was the British company's largest shareholder. But they, and other buyers, may conclude the messy nature of the weekend's collapse may have blighted the brand irretrievably. The package holiday share of the market has remained broadly unchanged. One reason for this is thatmost air package holidays sold by travel companies based in the UK have ATOL protection,external. This protection means that if the business collapses while travellers are away on holiday, they will be able to finish their trip and then travel home. If a business folds before someone's trip, the scheme will provide a refund or replacement holiday. Mr Strickland, the analyst, said a tax was suggested by his panel to fund repatriation of customers of failed travel companies, reducing the risks to the taxpayer. However, airlines argued that more successful airlines should not be punished for the failure of competitors, he said. Mr Jeans, the former Monarch executive, said aircraft flights will have been managed to bring them back to the UK and avoid them being seized by creditors.

Johnson 'must address conflict of interest claims'The government says it is investigating after claims against the PM are made by a newspaper.,"Labour has urged Boris Johnson to address claims he failed to declare a potential conflict of interest in how money was given to a US businesswoman while he was London mayor. The Sunday Times said,externalJennifer Arcuri, an entrepreneur associated with Mr Johnson, joined trade missions he led and was given Â£126,000 in public money. She told the paper this was part of her role as a legitimate businesswoman. No 10 declined to comment. A government department says it is investigating. Ms Arcuri was quoted by the Sunday Times as saying: ""Any grants received by my companies and any trade mission I joined were purely in respect of my role as a legitimate businesswoman."" The BBC has contacted her for comment. Labour's London mayor Sadiq Khan has told the BBC that he has ordered City Hall officials to look into the allegations. Mr Khan said: ""All I know is what I have seen in the press. These are very serious allegations. At the moment they are just allegations. ""I have asked my chief of staff to ask City Hall officials to look into what process there was during this time, were those processes followed, but also whether there are also any lessons that need to be learned."" The newspaper says she moved back to the US in June 2018, but her latest company won a Â£100,000 grant intended for ""English-based"" businesses earlier this year. The Sunday Times said it had found the registered address on the grant application form is a rented house in the UK and no longer connected to her. The paper said the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport was investigating the award of the grant after the newspaper's inquiries. The government has now confirmed to the BBC it is investigating. But it highlighted the funds were awarded to a UK-registered company. A statement from the Department for Digital, Culture, Media and Sport said: ""Funding for this scheme was awarded through open and fair competition. ""We regularly monitor grant initiatives and treat any allegations of impropriety with the utmost seriousness."" The Sunday Times claims one of Ms Arcuri's businesses also received Â£10,000 in sponsorship money from a mayoral organisation when Mr Johnson was in office, and she received a Â£15,000 government grant for foreign entrepreneurs to build businesses in Britain. Jon Trickett, shadow minister for the Cabinet Office, said Mr Johnson should provide full disclosure on the allegations. ""Boris Johnson must now give a full account of his actions in response to these grave and most serious allegations of the misuse use of public money in his former role as mayor of London,"" Mr Trickett said in a statement. ""The public has a right to know how and why these funds were used for the benefit of a close personal friend without on the face of it legitimate reason. ""This cannot be swept under the carpet. It is a matter of the integrity of the man now leading our country, who appears to believe he can get away with anything."" Mr Johnson was London mayor between 2008 and 2016.
