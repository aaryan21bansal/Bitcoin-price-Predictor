NHS England figures published on Friday showed the number of Covid patients in London hospitals stands at 7,277, up 32% on the previous week. Ch Insp Pete Shaw said: ""Whilst there are certain rules around people being allowed to exercise in public under this lockdown, nowhere in the legislation does it allow people to go to gyms to work out.

"Company offers GP staff Â£5,000 for unused vaccines","The company offered to pay surgeries a Â£5,000 charitable donation ""or to the staff member directly"" in emails A property investment company has offered GP surgeries Â£5,000 for unused coronavirus vaccine doses. The Hacking Trust's medical division approached surgeries in Bristol and Worthing offering to pay the money to charity ""or the staff member directly"". Robyn Clark, from the Institute of General Practice Management, said it was ""just appalling"". The company, based in London, has apologised, saying its ""good intentions"" were ""misinterpreted"". NHS England said people ""will rightly take a dim view of anyone who tries to jump the queue"". ""The NHS is free at the point of access for everyone who needs it,"" said Mrs Clark. ""What we felt this company was trying to do was jump the queue."" The Bristol-based manager said she worried it could ""create more health inequality"". She said: ""The JCVI [Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation] is trying to prioritise the vaccine based on the vulnerability to Covid."" The e-mail sent to the GP surgery in Worthing said The Hacking Trust was aware that ""many appointments"" for vaccinations are not kept, and that it would be interested in being informed of ""any no-shows"". A donation of Â£5,000 would be paid to a staff member or given to charity for each dose it could secure, the e-mail said. In a statement, the Battersea-based company said it ""offered charitable donations to staff or surgeries in this difficult time for any vaccines which were unused"". It added: ""We had heard that some vaccines were being unused due to missed appointments. We would apologise that our good intentions have been misinterpreted."" NHS England said it knew ""these particular emails were received across the country"". Dr Nikki Kanani, GP and NHS medical director for primary care, said hundreds of NHS teams across the country were ""working hard to deliver vaccines quickly to those who would benefit most"". ""NHS staff will never ask for, or accept, cash for vaccines,"" she said. The Department of Health and Social Care said vaccinations were available from the NHS ""for free"" and ""cannot be sold privately in the UK"".

US lifts restrictions on contacts with Taiwan,"Mike Pompeo said the US-Taiwan relationship should not be ""shackled"" (file photo) The US is lifting long-standing restrictions on contacts between American and Taiwanese officials, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo says. The ""self-imposed restrictions"" were introduced decades ago to ""appease"" the mainland Chinese government, which lays claim to the island, the US state department said in a statement. These rules are now ""null and void"". The move is likely to anger China and increase tensions between Washington and Beijing. It comes as the Trump administration enters its final days ahead of the inauguration of Joe Biden as president on 20 January. The Biden transition team have said the president-elect is committed to maintaining the long-standing US policy towards Taiwan. Analysts say they will be unhappy with such a policy decision being made in the final days of the Trump administration, but that the move could be reversed easily by Mr Pompeo's successor Antony Blinken. China regards Taiwan as a breakaway province, but Taiwan's leaders argue that it is a sovereign state. Relations between the two are frayed and there is a constant threat of a violent flare up that could drag in the US, an ally of Taiwan. What's behind the China-Taiwan divide? The Taiwan-sized challenge facing the next US president In a statement on Saturday, Mr Pompeo said the US state department had introduced complicated restrictions,externallimiting the communication between American diplomats and their Taiwanese counterparts. ""Today I am announcing that I am lifting all of these self-imposed restrictions,"" he said. ""Today's statement recognises that the US-Taiwan relationship need not, and should not, be shackled by self-imposed restrictions of our permanent bureaucracy."" He added that Taiwan was a vibrant democracy and a reliable US partner, and that the restrictions were no longer valid. Following the announcement, Taiwan Foreign Minister Joseph Wu thanked Mr Pompeo, saying he was ""grateful"". ""The closer partnership between Taiwan and the US is firmly based on our shared values, common interests and unshakeable belief in freedom and democracy,"" he wrote in a tweet. Last August, US Health and Human Services Secretary Alex Azar became the highest-ranking US politician to hold meetings on the island for decades. In response,China urged the US to respect what it calls its ""one China"" principle. The US also sells arms to Taiwan, though it does not have a formal defence treaty with the country, as it does with Japan, South Korea and the Philippines. This video can not be played President Tsai Ing-wen tells China to âface realityâ and show Taiwan respect China and Taiwan have had separate governments since the end of the Chinese civil war in 1949. Beijing has long tried to limit Taiwan's international activities and both have vied for influence in the Pacific region. Tensions have increased in recent years and Beijing has not ruled out the use of force to take the island back.

Covid: Wales 'ready to vaccinate at a higher rate',"The number of Covid patients in critical care is at its highest point since the first wave peak in April There is a ""light at the end of the tunnel"" with a third vaccination against Covid-19 but people need to keep safe in the meantime. That's the message from the body representing health boards in Wales. There are more than 2,700 patients in hospital with Covid, according to latest NHS Wales figures. ""It's incredibly serious at the moment, I can't emphasise that enough,"" said Welsh NHS confederation director Darren Hughes. There were more than 1,700 confirmed and suspected Covid-19 patients in Welsh hospitals at the most recent count, on Thursday. There were also another 1,000 patients in hospital beds recovering from the virus. Both are at record levels. The number of Covid patients in critical care is also at its highest point since the first wave peak in April. On Saturday,Public Health Wales reported a further 62 deaths with Covidover recent days, taking the total number since the start of the pandemic to 3,919. On New Year's Day, 55 people died - the highest for a single day during the pandemic. Meanwhile,a new report from the Welsh Government's scientific advisory body,externalsuggests there are ""significant numbers"" of the faster-spreading new variant of Covid in north Wales, particularly in Wrexham and Flintshire. It estimates up to two-thirds of cases in the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area are of this type. There was some suggestion it was increasing in south Wales, including Cardiff and Vale health board. ""If the new variant grows in Wales as it has in London, east and south-east England, it will bring a period of significant further increased pressure on the NHS,"" the report warned. ""In intensive care we're running at about 165% of normal capacity, we've got, you know, getting on for 3,000 people now in hospital with Covid or recovering from Covid,"" Mr Hughes toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. One consultant at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital near Llantrisant, Rhondda Cynon Taff,told BBC Wales of the pressuresand that ""we're definitely having more younger people with Covid that are becoming sick, the volume is very high in the community"". Mr Hughes described the vaccination rollout programme as a ""huge undertaking"" for staff already under pressure due to the health service's workload. ""If you look at the headline figures,Wales is slightly behind other parts of the UK, but I think it's important to remember that the vaccine has been delivered by healthcare staff,"" he said. ""What we are doing is vaccinating everybody and delivering the vaccines that have been delivered to Wales."" How many have died with Covid in Wales? Nurse's 'overwhelming fear' as 13 ambulances queue Mr Hughes said: ""Things are being ramped up from what I understand from the sort of 25,000 vaccinations being delivered to Wales, to go to much higher numbers in the coming weeks. ""We are ready to vaccinate at a much higher rate as soon as the vaccines become available, and good news yesterday that athird vaccineis coming on stream, pretty much straight away."" He added: ""We understand how tough it is for all of us in our families living in Wales; people directly affected, businesses affected, people's mental health affected. ""There is a light at the end of the tunnel with a vaccination coming online but please do all you can to keep yourselves and your family safe so that we in the NHS can can look after you all.""

Marcia Sturk receives her vaccine at a special clinic on Saturday About 100 patients in Swansea Bay got their first vaccine dose, when the Killay medical centre held a clinic on Saturday. Among the first in line was 82-year-old Marcia Sturk, who said she was ""happy to take advantage of the opportunity"" to receive the vaccine. There are about 1,800 patients aged over 80 on the surgery's list alone, and across the health board area, there are around 24,000 in that age group who should receive a first dose in the next few weeks. Surgeries will be contacting patients directly, by telephone or letter, to arrange an appointment. Wales' vaccine programme 'not a competition' Third Covid vaccine approved in the UK GP Dr Chris Johns said: ""We are very pleased to be involved and begin these vaccinations. It feels like it's been a long time coming, but we've started at last. ""We will be vaccinating 100 people today and as well as holding special clinics in the surgery we are also looking at using some community venues as well to help us get around everyone."" Meanwhile, Cwm Taf Morgannwg said 808 doses had been given at care homes in its area so far, with another 954 planned for next week. More than 300 have also been vaccinated at GP practices across the health board, with a further 3,000 planned for next week. In Denbighshire, Vale of Clwyd Conservative MP Dr James Davies said he had been ""inundated with messages from understandably anxious elderly constituents and relatives of care home residents who have seen those in their position being vaccinated in nearby Cheshire, Wirral and Shropshire, but are yet to receive an invitation for vaccination themselves"". Betsi Cadwaladr health board, which manages the health service in north Wales, said it had received5,000 doses of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine,externalthis week to vaccinate care home staff and residents, as well as hospital inpatients and those over the age of 80. It said 300 people aged over 80 would be vaccinated at mass vaccination centres this week, and arrangements had been made to contact individuals by telephone. The first minister has said the""ambition""is for the top priority groups in Wales to get Covid vaccines by mid-February. Prof Andrew Easton, an expert on virology at the University of Warwick, said the global spread of coronavirus could mean society has to ""live with the virus rather than to hope for its removal"", similar to flu. ""It has gone so far around the world that eliminating it is going to be almost impossible, not entirely"" he said. ""So we will have to learn to live with it,"" he said, adding that improved hygiene habits such as wearing face masks may need to continue into the future.

Queen and Prince Philip vaccinated against Covid,"The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have received Covid-19 vaccinations, Buckingham Palace has said. A royal source said the vaccinations were administered on Saturday by a household doctor at Windsor Castle. The source added the Queen decided to let it be known she had the vaccination to prevent further speculation. The Queen, 94, and Prince Philip, 99, are among around 1.5 million people in the UK to have had at least one dose of a Covid vaccine so far. People aged over 80 in the UK are among the high-priority groups who are being given the vaccine first. The couple have been spending the lockdown in England at their Windsor Castle home after deciding to have a quiet Christmas at their Berkshire residence, instead of the traditional royal family gathering at Sandringham. When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? Europe's slow start: How many have had the jab? Pfizer vaccine 'works' against key variant mutation Last month,the Queen appeared alongside several other senior members of the royal familyfor the first time since the coronavirus pandemic began. In 2020 she went seven months - between March and October -without carrying out public engagementsoutside of a royal residence. During that time, her eldest child,Prince Charles, 72, contracted coronavirusand displayed mild symptoms. Palace sources also told the BBC that her grandsonPrince William tested positive in April- although Kensington Palace refused to comment officially. The Queen made a private pilgrimage to the grave of the Unknown Warrior in Westminster Abbey in November The Queen used her Christmas Day messageto reassure anyone struggling without friends and family this year that they ""are not alone"". She said the pandemic had ""brought us closer"" despite causing hardship, adding that the Royal Family has been ""inspired"" by people volunteering in their communities. On Friday a third coronavirus vaccine - made by US company Moderna -was approved for use in the UK,joining the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines already approved by UK regulators. It is not known which vaccine the Queen and Prince Philip have received. All the approved vaccines require two doses to provide the best possible protection, with the second dose being given up to 12 weeks after the first. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the aim is to vaccinate 15 million people in the UK by mid-February, including care home residents and staff, frontline NHS staff, everyone over 70 and those who have been categorised as clinically extremely vulnerable.

Boeing 737 plane feared crashed in Indonesia,"Relatives of those on board are waiting anxiously for news A Boeing 737 passenger plane carrying 62 people is believed to have crashed into the sea shortly after take-off from Indonesia's capital Jakarta. The Sriwijaya Air disappeared from radars four minutes into its journey to Pontianak in West Kalimantan province. It is thought to have dropped more than 3,000m (10,000ft) in less than a minute, according to flight tracking website Flightradar24.com. Witnesses said they had seen and heard at least one explosion. Fisherman Solihin, who goes by one name, told the BBC Indonesian service he had witnessed a crash and his captain decided to return to land. ""The plane fell like lightning into the sea and exploded in the water,"" he said. ""It was pretty close to us, the shards of a kind of plywood almost hit my ship."" A timeline of global air disasters Plane crash fatalities fell more than 50% in 2019 Mechanical v human: Why do planes crash? A number of residents of an island near where the plane disappeared told the BBC they had found objects they thought were from the plane. Police officers and fishermen show debris that they believe came from the plane Search and rescue efforts were suspended overnight but were due to resume on Sunday. The Indonesian navy was reportedly deployed to look for the aircraft on Saturday. Navy official Abdul Rasyid told Reuters news agency it had determined the plane's coordinates and ships had been deployed to the location. The aircraft is not a 737 Max, the Boeing model that was grounded from March 2019 until last December following two deadly crashes. Last contact with the plane, with the call sign SJY182, was made at 14:40 local time (07:40 GMT), according to the transport ministry. The usual flight time to Pontianak, in the west of the island of Borneo, is 90 minutes. It did not send a distress signal, according to the head of national search and rescue agency Air Marshal Bagus Puruhito. There were thought to be 50 passengers - including seven children and three babies - and 12 crew on board, though the plane has a capacity of 130. Everyone on board was Indonesian, officials say. Relatives of the passengers have been waiting anxiously at the airport in Pontianak, as well as at Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta International Airport. ""I have four family members on the flight - my wife and my three children,"" Yaman Zai told reporters through tears. ""[My wife] sent me a picture of the baby today... How could my heart not be torn into pieces?"" According to registration details, the plane is a 26-year-old Boeing 737-500. It was in good condition, Sriwijaya Air chief executive Jefferson Irwin Jauwena told reporters. Take-off had been delayed for 30 minutes due to heavy rain, he said. Sriwijaya Air, founded in 2003, is a local budget airline which flies to Indonesian and other South-East Asian destinations. The Sriwijaya Air plane disappeared from radar screens shortly after take-off (file photo) The plane went missing about 20km (12 miles) north of the capital Jakarta, not far from where another flight crashed in October 2018. A total of 189 died when an Indonesian Lion Air flight plunged into the sea about 12 minutes after take-off from the city. Boeing 737 Max returns to skies after safety fears Series of failures behind Boeing Lion Air crash Boeing to pay $2.5bn over 737 Max conspiracy That disaster was blamed on a series of failures in the plane's design, but also faults by the airline and the pilots. It was one of two crashes that led regulators to pull the Boeing 737 Max from service. The model resumed passenger flights in December after a systems overhaul. The BBC's Jerome Wirawan in Jakarta says the latest events will bring up difficult questions and emotions in Indonesia, whose airline industry has faced intense scrutiny since the Lion Air crash. The aircraft which appears to have been lost off Indonesia was a Boeing 737, but it should not be confused with the much more modern 737 Max - which was grounded following two tragic accidents in 2018 and 2019, including one off the coast of Indonesia. The Sriwijaya Air flight appears to have been carried out by a Boeing 737-500. This plane formed part of the 737 Classic series, the second generation of 737, which was built during the 1980s and 1990s. The plane, seen as a workhorse aircraft for many years, has a strong safety record. The Sriwijaya Air 737 was 26 years old. While airlines do tend to prefer to fly newer aircraft - because they have lower running costs - it is not uncommon to find planes of this age still in service. Indonesia, though, has a relatively poor record on aviation safety. For more than a decade carriers from the region were banned from flying into the EU. Until recently, the perception had been that standards were improving, and in 2018 all Indonesian airlines were removed from the EU's blacklist. That, however, was before the loss of a Lion Air 737 Max in October 2018. Although the design of the aircraft is widely believed to have been the main cause of the accident, investigators also highlighted issues such as poor maintenance procedures and inadequate flying skills as contributory factors.

'QAnon Shaman' charged over pro-Trump riots,"Jacob Anthony Chansley is alleged to be the man seen wearing horns and a fur hat in photographs, including this from inside the Senate chamber A prominent follower of the baseless conspiracy theory QAnon has been charged over the US Capitol riots. Jacob Anthony Chansley, known as Jake Angeli, is in custody on charges including violent entry and disorderly conduct. Mr Chansley, who calls himself the QAnon Shaman, is allegedly the man pictured with a painted face, fur hat and horns inside Congress on Wednesday. Donald Trump faces another impeachment charge for his role in the unrest. Democrats accuse the president of encouraging the riots, in which five people died. The FBI has been appealing to the public to help bring the assailants to justice. The 65 days that led to chaos at the Capitol What is QAnon? The hunt to identify and arrest Capitol rioters Could Trump be removed from power? Mr Chansley has not commented publicly on the charges. A statement from the federal attorney for Washington DC said: ""It is alleged that Chansley was identified as the man seen in media coverage,externalwho entered the Capitol building dressed in horns, a bearskin headdress, red, white and blue face paint, shirtless, and tan pants. ""This individual carried a spear, approximately 6 feet in length, with an American flag tied just below the blade."" By Sophie Long, BBC News, Phoenix, Arizona I arranged to meet Jake Angeli, also known as the ""Q Shaman"", at a rally in Phoenix on Saturday to talk about his role in Wednesday's riot, or in what he called that ""beautiful day"". Timings were difficult he said, because he had a voluntary appointment with the FBI first. I didn't find that surprising. The fact he thought he might be free to leave, more so. But he was unperturbed because, he said, he had done nothing wrong and he had truth and God on his side. Earlier I asked Trump supporters in Tuscon if what they saw on Wednesday had changed their opinion of the outgoing president. No, they said, it was peaceful protest that had been infiltrated by violent members of the far left. I asked Jake Angeli if that was what he witnessed. He told me there were no members of Antifa or any other left-wing organisations present in or around the Capitol building on 6 January. It was ""patriots doing what our founding fathers would have done"". The reason he knew that was ""because Antifa are cowards who have no commitment to their country or their cause"". The statement said police had also detained a man from Florida believed to have been photographed carrying House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's lectern from the House of Representatives chamber. Adam Johnson, 36, is being held on charges including one count of theft of government property and one count of violent entry. A man is pictured carrying the lectern from the House of Representatives Also among those charged is West Virginia state lawmaker, Derrick Evans.

The former maraca-shaking dancer, 56, wants torival Joe Wickswith his online YouTube classes ""Get Buzzin' With Bez"" to be launched on 17 January. Bez, whose on-stage ""freaky dancing"" made him an icon of the 'Madchester' music scene, has admitted he also wants to budge his own lockdown bulge.

He said: ""I'd like to think I'm somewhere between Joe Wicks and Mr Motivator. ""I've started this new year seriously unfit, with a fat belly and creaky hips, and I can't stop eating chocolate. ""Last lockdown I got unfit, fat, lazy and into some seriously bad eating habits. Bez being put through his paces with a personal trainer ""This year, this lockdown, I need to sort it out sharpish."" He said that people can join him on ""on this mad  journey or just sit on the sofa and have a good laugh at me"". Bez said he has ""started this new year seriously unfit, with a fat belly and creaky hips"" The former dancer added: ""At the very least, I know I'll be making people smile, at best I'll be helping people get fit and mentally happier alongside me."" The Happy Mondays, along with bands like The Stone Roses and Inspiral Carpets, spearheaded the indie music 'Madchester' scene of the late 80s and early 90s. Bez dancing with his maraca on BBC One's Top of the Pops as the band perform Step On in 1989 Bez's bug-eyed dance routines were said to have inspired the group's song Freaky Dancin' and made him one of the best-known members of the group, alongside frontman Shaun Ryder.

Covid fine review welcomed by 'intimidated' womenThe friends said they were relieved people would not have to fear being fined for taking a walk.,"Jessica Allen (left) and Eliza Moore said their cars were ""surrounded"" by police Two women who criticised a police force for its ""intimidating"" approach to lockdown fines have welcomed a review. Jessica Allen and Eliza Moore were walking at a reservoir five miles from their home when they were stopped by officers and fined Â£200 each. Derbyshire Police insisted driving to exercise was ""not in the spirit"" of lockdown but later said new guidance meant it would look again at the issue. Both women said they were pleased the force had decided to think again. Derbyshire Police and Crime Commissioner Hardyal Dhindsa said an ""urgent review"" was under way about how fines had been issued. Longstanding guidance from the College of Policing saysofficers should follow the ""Four Es"",externaland only give fixed penalty notices as a last resort. Jessica Allen and Eliza Moore said their cars were surrounded by police when they arrived Ms Allen said: ""We are happy to hear that Derbyshire Police have been told to not be so heavy handed with fines and return to the Four Es they were originally doing. ""We are yet to hear anything regarding our fine but if we have managed to save somebody the worry of going for a walk and fearing they would be fined then we have done what we set out to do."" Ms Allen and Ms Moore drove separately from Ashby-de-la-Zouch in Leicestershire the five miles to Foremark Reservoir on Wednesday afternoon. Seal sightseeing couple fined for 130-mile trip What can police do to enforce lockdown rules? Covid 'out of control in London', Sadiq Khan says They said theircars were ""surrounded"" by police, questioned on why they were there and told the hot drinks they had brought along were not allowed as they were ""classed as a picnic"". Ms Allen said the experience was ""very intimidating"" and had left her feeling scared of police in general. Initially Derbyshire Police defended its actions, saying legislation said trips should be ""local"" and driving to a location to exercise ""is clearly not in the spirit of the national effort to reduce our travel, reduce the possible spread of the disease and reduce the number of deaths"". Derbyshire police also fined visitors to other beauty spots like Calke Abbey Derbyshire Police has also been giving fixed penalty notices to people who visit beauty spots at Calke Abbey and Elvaston Castle. But later, the force said new guidance from the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) had ""clarified the policing response concerning travel and exercise"". The guidance said: ""The Covid regulations which officers enforce and which enables them to issue FPNs [fixed penalty notices] for breaches, do not restrict the distance travelled for exercise."" Mr Dhindsa said: ""It would appear that the force has been a little over-zealous in its interpretation of the guidance. ""While the police can enforce the regulations, guidance is just that which can make this a very challenging and complex situation to police."" The chief constable of neighbouring Nottinghamshire, Craig Guildford, said: ""We are not out and about telling people they have gone too far from home. We trust the public to take these regulations seriously. ""Derbyshire to be fair to them have some unique places that people may want to go to from a load of counties. ""But our approach is around reasonableness. If someone has gone 50 miles, we will take action, if someone has gone a couple of miles we are very sensible.""

Lockdown rules 'blatantly ignored' at Welsh beauty spot,"This car was one of many turned away by police at Moel Famau on Saturday People are ""blatantly"" ignoring rules on lockdown restrictions despite repeated warnings, police have said. More than 100 cars had been turned away from Moel Famau on the Flintshire border by Saturday lunchtime, with some driving past ""road closed"" signs. In Snowdonia, Gwynedd, a warden said a group from Leicester would have ""probably ignored our advice"" if police had not arrived and told them to leave. Level four restrictionsmean travelling for exercise is not allowed in Wales. Beacons visitors travel 180 miles despite Covid rules Keith Ellis, a warden at Pen y Pass in Snowdonia, said while it had been much quieter this weekend, people were still travelling, despite the restrictions. ""We've had three from Leicester first thing this morning and if the police hadn't turned up they would have probably ignored our advice and carried on up the mountain,"" he said. ""What they were wearing was totally inappropriate and they would have probably got into danger. ""We've had people also from Liverpool and some locals turning up knowing full well what the rules are, but just trying it on.

"Chickens at risk of cull as egg demand dropsThe farm has been left with over 4,000 surplus eggs after schools suddenly closed to most pupils.","Ben Jackson said the closure of the farm's bulk-buyers like hotels and schools has left thousands of eggs unsold A fall in bulk egg orders due to the lockdown could lead to chickens being culled, a poultry-farmer has warned. Fluffetts Farm near Fordingbridge had been supplying free range eggs to 350 Hampshire schools, but orders stopped when schools suddenly closed. Farm owner, Ben Jackson said: ""If you can't sell the eggs you can't still keep feeding the chickens and therefore something has to give."" He said he hoped to work out a local delivery system to avoid culling birds. Mr Jackson, who has been selling some of the surplus eggs off on social media, has more than 13,000 chickens laying 12,000 eggs each day. The cancellation of his school orders has left him with about 4,000 spare eggs a day. The farm has also been hit by restaurants and pubs closing again. The farm has a surplus of about 4,000 eggs each day from its 13,000 chickens He said: ""If we can't find a home for the eggs the worst-case scenario is that we may have to look to get rid of some of our chickens, but that's what we're trying to avoid. ""Other chicken farmers are in the same situation - they are talking about potentially having to cull birds in the next week or so - it's not a decision that anyone wants to make. ""We just want to get through this dark time - we're just taking it a day at time."" Chickens at the farm are currently in a bird lockdown.

They were brought to you by Sarah Collerton, Jennifer Meierhans, Victoria Lindrea and Sophie Williams. The live page will be finishing for the day soon so here's a look at the main headlines:  Some people across the UK have been able to form household support bubbles or extended households. The aim is to help people who've been cut off from friends and family. A bubble is an exclusive group of people with whom you have close physical contact. People in a bubble can stay overnight in each other's homes, visit outdoors places together and do not have to socially distance. In England the government has also created childcare support bubbles, allowing one other household to provide informal childcare. But who is eligible and what how do the rules differ between the nations? And what about bubbles in schools? Health editor Michelle Roberts explains. France is extending curfews in a bid to curb the spread of the virus Authorities in France are set to extend a curfew
to eight more regions as it tries to curb the spread of the virus. The entire country iscurrently under a curfew
from 8pm to 6am. However, in 15 of the worst affected regions, this was later adjusted to 6pm. A further eight regions will have the earlier
curfew enforced, Prime Minister Jean Castex said. He said it was a ""tough and necessary"" response. The new regions set to go under an earlier
curfew include the Bouches-du-Rhone region, home to Marseille. Rachael Powell is ""angry and upset"" about her daughter Emmeline missing out during lockdown New parents missing baby classes and playdates due to lockdown say their children's development has been hit by the impact of coronavirus. When Rachael Powell's one-year-old daughter Emmeline met her grandparents for the first time she ""absolutely screamed the place down"" as she ""didn't know who they were"". ""I was really looking forward to going to coffee shops, meeting other mums and going to baby classes and then everything stopped,"" says the 39-year-old from Greater Manchester. ""I felt guilty that she didn't get any of that and have that interaction."" Education consultant and child psychologist Paul Kelly says Covid is having a ""massive impact"" on babies. ""We are social creatures, social beings - it is pre-programmed in our brains,"" he says.

""When children's brains are stimulated, they grow."" Dr Kelly says there is also an impact on parents, who are missing out on ""mutual support"". He says people should ""grab what they can, when they can"" during these uncertain times and focus on ""how you can enhance [your baby's] development... rather than spending time thinking about how your child might be behind"". Read morehere. For people who are most sick with Covid-19 - those whose lungs have not been helped by a ventilator - there is another alternative: ECMO. These are specialist intensive care life support machines which pump oxygen into the patients blood, allowing the lungs to rest. There are only six NHS centres in the UK that offer the treatment to a few dozen patients, but now they're under pressure to take on more. Health correspondent Sophie Hutchinson was given rare access to an ECMO unit at the Royal Papworth Hospital in Cambridge: This video can not be played Two MPs have accused a police force of ""bias"" and ""inconsistency"" after officers issued fixed penalty notices to campaigners visiting a memorial. West Midlands Police gave fines to six people who attended a memorial to the victims of the Birmingham pub bombings. Among them was Julie Hambleton whose sister died in the November 1974 attack. Conservative MPs Gary Sambrook and Nicola Richards wrote to Chief Constable Sir Dave Thompson, asking for the decision to be reconsidered as the campaigners had been ""singled out"". ""It is deeply concerning and morally wrong to fine the victims' families of a terrorist attack who are campaigning for justice,"" they said. ""While mass protests have been allowed to go unchecked through our city throughout the year. This is an inconsistent approach and from the outside incredibly bias [sic]."" West Midlands Police has been contacted for a response and you can read about what happened in more detailhere. As we mentioned earlier, vaccinations are set to
begin in India next week. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the vaccinations,
which start on 16 January, are a ""landmark step"" in the fight against Covid. India is aiming to vaccinate 300 million people
by July. Frontline workers, those over 50 and other high
risk people will be the first to receive the vaccine. India has approved two vaccines â one produced by
Indian pharmaceutical Bharat Biotech and the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. The country has recorded more than 10 million
cases and 150,570 deaths since the pandemic began. Police battled to disperse the protestors gathering in Clapham Common Twelve people have been arrested during an anti-lockdown protest in south London. Police officers clashed with some of the mask-less protesters who arrived at Clapham Common, some shouting ""take your freedom back"". Gathering for the purpose of a protest is not an exemption to the rules, the Met Police said. Six police vans were deployed to the scene while officers moved crowds away from the area. One woman shouted from her car at the protesters ""there's a pandemic going"". You can read more and see pictures of the sceneshere. More than 80,000 peoplehave died in the UKwithin 28 days of a positive Covid test since the start of the pandemic. The number of daily deaths on Saturday was 1,035, taking the total to 80,868,according to data from the UK government.,external A total of 59,937 people have tested positive for Covid in the past 24 hours. Today's figures are slightly lower than yesterday's record number of deaths and cases - 1,325 and 68,053 respectively. Is any proof of vaccination being given which can be used in future for travel, theatre, restaurants and sporting events? asks Jane Hartley-Allen from Halstead Online health editor Michelle Roberts replies: A patient's medical record will be updated with information about the vaccine they have been given. There is no recommendation so far in the UK that people need proof of vaccination for reasons such as travel or socialising. And remember, if you have been vaccinated, it takes time for protection to build. No vaccine is 100% effective and we still do not know how long immunity will last. People who have received a coronavirus vaccine should continue to follow social distancing rules to protect themselves and others."" England, Northern Ireland, Wales and much of Scotland are under lockdown as cases of Covid-19 continue to rise. The main message across the UK is stay at home but if you're confused about the rules in your nation we've got them allhere. A survivor of the Aberfan disasterhas died after contracting Covid-19. As a nine-year-old, Bernard Thomas was rescued from the rubble of Pantglas primary school when the collapse of a mining tip outside the Welsh town of Aberfan left 144 people dead, including 116 school children.

Human rights group Amnesty International has criticised an order by Iran's leader banning vaccines made in the UK and US. On Friday, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
said he told authorities not to import vaccines from the two countries as he did not
trust them. In a statement, Amnesty International said the
move was âin step with authoritiesâ decades long contempt for human rights,
including the right to life and healthâ. Iran's Red Crescent society has announced it has
paused the import of 150,000 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, which it had organised. It comes as Twitter removed a tweet from the Iranian leader criticising the UK and US vaccines. Iran has recorded more than 1.2 million cases
and 56,018 deaths. We told you earlier about thetwo women in Derbyshire who were each fined Â£200 after they were stopped by policeofficers while going to walk at a site more than five miles from their home. Derbyshire police subsequently agreed to review the fines, after new guidance from the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) ""clarified the policing response concerning travel and exercise"". Jessica Allen and Eliza Moore, who criticised a police force for its ""intimidating"" approach to lockdown fines, have welcomed the review. Ms Allen said: ""We are happy to hear that Derbyshire Police have been told to not be so heavy handed with fines. ""We are yet to hear anything regarding our fine but if we have managed to save somebody the worry of going for a walk and fearing they would be fined then we have done what we set out to do."" Longstanding guidance from the College of Policing saysofficers should follow the ""Four Es"",externaland only give fixed penalty notices as a last resort. The Queen and Prince Philip have been vaccinated against Covid-19. âThe Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have today received
Covid-19 vaccinations,"" a Buckingham Palace spokesperson confirmed. A royal source said the vaccines were administered by a household doctor at Windsor Castle. Her
Majesty decided that she would let it be known that she and Prince Philip had received the vaccination to prevent inaccuracies and further speculation, they said. India is aiming to vaccinate 300 million people by July Here are some of the latest headlines from the world
today: The number of people being treated in Scotland's hospitals for coronavirus has reached another record daily high. Latest Scottish government figures show a total of 1,596 people are in hospital with recently confirmed Covid, up from 1,530 patients recorded on Friday. A further 93 people who had tested positive for the virus have died in the past 24 hours. The company offered to pay surgeries a Â£5,000 charitable donation ""or to the staff member directly"" in emails A property investment firm has apologised for offering GP surgeries in England Â£5,000 for unused coronavirus vaccine doses. The Hacking Trust's medical division approached surgeries in Bristol and Worthing offering to pay the money to charity ""or the staff member directly"". Robyn Clark, from the Institute of General Practice Management, says the move was ""just appalling"" and she felt the company was ""trying to jump the queue"". ""The NHS is free at the point of access for everyone who needs it,"" said Clark. A statement from the London-based company says: ""We had heard that some vaccines were being unused due to missed appointments. We would apologise that our good intentions have been misinterpreted.""

Moyes says footballers are ""like most human beings at times, they can get things wrong"" and ""a lot of people are throwing stones in glass houses"".

More than 100 cars had been turned away from Moel Famau on the Flintshire border by Saturday lunchtime, with some driving past ""road closed"" signs.

""What they were wearing was totally inappropriate and they would have probably got into danger.

LiveLiveEngland lockdown compliance 'more vital than ever'Less than a minute ago,"More than 80,000 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test since the start of the pandemic Scientists advising the government say lockdown measures in England need to be stricter It comes as the government launches a new advertising campaign to try to boost compliance Government sources say there is likely to be more focus from police on enforcing rather than explaining rules The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have been vaccinated at Windsor Castle India will begin vaccinating its citizens next week and aims to vaccinate 300 million by July Saudi Arabiaâs King Salman Bin Abdulaziz has received his first dose of the vaccine, state media reports Edited by Sarah Collerton We are wrapping up the live page now, thanks for following our updates. They were brought to you by Sarah Collerton, Jennifer Meierhans, Victoria Lindrea and Sophie Williams. The live page will be finishing for the day soon so here's a look at the main headlines:  Some people across the UK have been able to form household support bubbles or extended households. The aim is to help people who've been cut off from friends and family. A bubble is an exclusive group of people with whom you have close physical contact. People in a bubble can stay overnight in each other's homes, visit outdoors places together and do not have to socially distance. In England the government has also created childcare support bubbles, allowing one other household to provide informal childcare. But who is eligible and what how do the rules differ between the nations? And what about bubbles in schools? Health editor Michelle Roberts explains. France is extending curfews in a bid to curb the spread of the virus Authorities in France are set to extend a curfew
to eight more regions as it tries to curb the spread of the virus. The entire country iscurrently under a curfew
from 8pm to 6am. However, in 15 of the worst affected regions, this was later adjusted to 6pm. A further eight regions will have the earlier
curfew enforced, Prime Minister Jean Castex said. He said it was a ""tough and necessary"" response. The new regions set to go under an earlier
curfew include the Bouches-du-Rhone region, home to Marseille. Rachael Powell is ""angry and upset"" about her daughter Emmeline missing out during lockdown New parents missing baby classes and playdates due to lockdown say their children's development has been hit by the impact of coronavirus. When Rachael Powell's one-year-old daughter Emmeline met her grandparents for the first time she ""absolutely screamed the place down"" as she ""didn't know who they were"". ""I was really looking forward to going to coffee shops, meeting other mums and going to baby classes and then everything stopped,"" says the 39-year-old from Greater Manchester. ""I felt guilty that she didn't get any of that and have that interaction."" Education consultant and child psychologist Paul Kelly says Covid is having a ""massive impact"" on babies. ""We are social creatures, social beings - it is pre-programmed in our brains,"" he says.

""When children's brains are stimulated, they grow."" Dr Kelly says there is also an impact on parents, who are missing out on ""mutual support"". He says people should ""grab what they can, when they can"" during these uncertain times and focus on ""how you can enhance [your baby's] development... rather than spending time thinking about how your child might be behind"".

These are specialist intensive care life support machines which pump oxygen into the patients blood, allowing the lungs to rest. There are only six NHS centres in the UK that offer the treatment to a few dozen patients, but now they're under pressure to take on more. Health correspondent Sophie Hutchinson was given rare access to an ECMO unit at the Royal Papworth Hospital in Cambridge: This video can not be played Two MPs have accused a police force of ""bias"" and ""inconsistency"" after officers issued fixed penalty notices to campaigners visiting a memorial. West Midlands Police gave fines to six people who attended a memorial to the victims of the Birmingham pub bombings. Among them was Julie Hambleton whose sister died in the November 1974 attack. Conservative MPs Gary Sambrook and Nicola Richards wrote to Chief Constable Sir Dave Thompson, asking for the decision to be reconsidered as the campaigners had been ""singled out"". ""It is deeply concerning and morally wrong to fine the victims' families of a terrorist attack who are campaigning for justice,"" they said. ""While mass protests have been allowed to go unchecked through our city throughout the year. This is an inconsistent approach and from the outside incredibly bias [sic]."" West Midlands Police has been contacted for a response and you can read about what happened in more detailhere. As we mentioned earlier, vaccinations are set to
begin in India next week. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the vaccinations,
which start on 16 January, are a ""landmark step"" in the fight against Covid. India is aiming to vaccinate 300 million people
by July. Frontline workers, those over 50 and other high
risk people will be the first to receive the vaccine. India has approved two vaccines â one produced by
Indian pharmaceutical Bharat Biotech and the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. The country has recorded more than 10 million
cases and 150,570 deaths since the pandemic began. Police battled to disperse the protestors gathering in Clapham Common Twelve people have been arrested during an anti-lockdown protest in south London. Police officers clashed with some of the mask-less protesters who arrived at Clapham Common, some shouting ""take your freedom back"". Gathering for the purpose of a protest is not an exemption to the rules, the Met Police said. Six police vans were deployed to the scene while officers moved crowds away from the area. One woman shouted from her car at the protesters ""there's a pandemic going"". You can read more and see pictures of the sceneshere. More than 80,000 peoplehave died in the UKwithin 28 days of a positive Covid test since the start of the pandemic. The number of daily deaths on Saturday was 1,035, taking the total to 80,868,according to data from the UK government.,external A total of 59,937 people have tested positive for Covid in the past 24 hours. Today's figures are slightly lower than yesterday's record number of deaths and cases - 1,325 and 68,053 respectively. Is any proof of vaccination being given which can be used in future for travel, theatre, restaurants and sporting events? asks Jane Hartley-Allen from Halstead Online health editor Michelle Roberts replies: A patient's medical record will be updated with information about the vaccine they have been given. There is no recommendation so far in the UK that people need proof of vaccination for reasons such as travel or socialising. And remember, if you have been vaccinated, it takes time for protection to build. No vaccine is 100% effective and we still do not know how long immunity will last. People who have received a coronavirus vaccine should continue to follow social distancing rules to protect themselves and others."" England, Northern Ireland, Wales and much of Scotland are under lockdown as cases of Covid-19 continue to rise. The main message across the UK is stay at home but if you're confused about the rules in your nation we've got them allhere. A survivor of the Aberfan disasterhas died after contracting Covid-19. As a nine-year-old, Bernard Thomas was rescued from the rubble of Pantglas primary school when the collapse of a mining tip outside the Welsh town of Aberfan left 144 people dead, including 116 school children. Thomas, who was later diagnosed with post-traumatic stress, died on Wednesday, aged 63. ""Bernard was a real character and his death has come as a shock to us as a family and the community of Aberfan,"" said his brother Andrew. ""We can't be sure where he caught Covid, but he had an eye appointment at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital on 21 December. ""A few days later, he became ill and at Prince Charles Hospital, he tested positive for Covid-19. ""Although he had been receiving oxygen through a mask, we spoke regularly on the phone and he told us he was getting better. ""But on Wednesday morning he removed his mask to eat his breakfast, and 10 minutes after eating he faded away. ""It's a huge shock, but I don't blame anybody."" Human rights group Amnesty International has criticised an order by Iran's leader banning vaccines made in the UK and US. On Friday, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
said he told authorities not to import vaccines from the two countries as he did not
trust them. In a statement, Amnesty International said the
move was âin step with authoritiesâ decades long contempt for human rights,
including the right to life and healthâ. Iran's Red Crescent society has announced it has
paused the import of 150,000 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, which it had organised. It comes as Twitter removed a tweet from the Iranian leader criticising the UK and US vaccines. Iran has recorded more than 1.2 million cases
and 56,018 deaths. We told you earlier about thetwo women in Derbyshire who were each fined Â£200 after they were stopped by policeofficers while going to walk at a site more than five miles from their home. Derbyshire police subsequently agreed to review the fines, after new guidance from the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) ""clarified the policing response concerning travel and exercise"". Jessica Allen and Eliza Moore, who criticised a police force for its ""intimidating"" approach to lockdown fines, have welcomed the review. Ms Allen said: ""We are happy to hear that Derbyshire Police have been told to not be so heavy handed with fines. ""We are yet to hear anything regarding our fine but if we have managed to save somebody the worry of going for a walk and fearing they would be fined then we have done what we set out to do."" Longstanding guidance from the College of Policing saysofficers should follow the ""Four Es"",externaland only give fixed penalty notices as a last resort. The Queen and Prince Philip have been vaccinated against Covid-19. âThe Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have today received

""Last lockdown I got unfit, fat, lazy and into some seriously bad eating habits. Bez being put through his paces with a personal trainer ""This year, this lockdown, I need to sort it out sharpish."" He said that people can join him on ""on this mad  journey or just sit on the sofa and have a good laugh at me"".

Maraca-shaking dancer Bez and lead singer Shaun Ryder in 1989 Bez, whose real name is Mark Berry, will be shown being trained in the fitness classes rather than acting as the instructor himself. He said: ""I'd like to think I'm somewhere between Joe Wicks and Mr Motivator. ""I've started this new year seriously unfit, with a fat belly and creaky hips, and I can't stop eating chocolate. ""Last lockdown I got unfit, fat, lazy and into some seriously bad eating habits. Bez being put through his paces with a personal trainer ""This year, this lockdown, I need to sort it out sharpish."" He said that people can join him on ""on this mad  journey or just sit on the sofa and have a good laugh at me"". Bez said he has ""started this new year seriously unfit, with a fat belly and creaky hips"" The former dancer added: ""At the very least, I know I'll be making people smile, at best I'll be helping people get fit and mentally happier alongside me."" The Happy Mondays, along with bands like The Stone Roses and Inspiral Carpets, spearheaded the indie music 'Madchester' scene of the late 80s and early 90s. Bez dancing with his maraca on BBC One's Top of the Pops as the band perform Step On in 1989 Bez's bug-eyed dance routines were said to have inspired the group's song Freaky Dancin' and made him one of the best-known members of the group, alongside frontman Shaun Ryder. Their hits included Step On, Kinky Afro, Hallelujah and 24 Hour Party People. However, serious drug habits and infighting led to the Salford band's breakup in 1993.

Covid fine review welcomed by 'intimidated' women,"Jessica Allen (left) and Eliza Moore said their cars were ""surrounded"" by police Two women who criticised a police force for its ""intimidating"" approach to lockdown fines have welcomed a review. Jessica Allen and Eliza Moore were walking at a reservoir five miles from their home when they were stopped by officers and fined Â£200 each. Derbyshire Police insisted driving to exercise was ""not in the spirit"" of lockdown but later said new guidance meant it would look again at the issue. Both women said they were pleased the force had decided to think again. Derbyshire Police and Crime Commissioner Hardyal Dhindsa said an ""urgent review"" was under way about how fines had been issued. Longstanding guidance from the College of Policing saysofficers should follow the ""Four Es"",externaland only give fixed penalty notices as a last resort. Jessica Allen and Eliza Moore said their cars were surrounded by police when they arrived Ms Allen said: ""We are happy to hear that Derbyshire Police have been told to not be so heavy handed with fines and return to the Four Es they were originally doing. ""We are yet to hear anything regarding our fine but if we have managed to save somebody the worry of going for a walk and fearing they would be fined then we have done what we set out to do."" Ms Allen and Ms Moore drove separately from Ashby-de-la-Zouch in Leicestershire the five miles to Foremark Reservoir on Wednesday afternoon. Seal sightseeing couple fined for 130-mile trip What can police do to enforce lockdown rules? Covid 'out of control in London', Sadiq Khan says They said theircars were ""surrounded"" by police, questioned on why they were there and told the hot drinks they had brought along were not allowed as they were ""classed as a picnic"". Ms Allen said the experience was ""very intimidating"" and had left her feeling scared of police in general. Initially Derbyshire Police defended its actions, saying legislation said trips should be ""local"" and driving to a location to exercise ""is clearly not in the spirit of the national effort to reduce our travel, reduce the possible spread of the disease and reduce the number of deaths"". Derbyshire police also fined visitors to other beauty spots like Calke Abbey Derbyshire Police has also been giving fixed penalty notices to people who visit beauty spots at Calke Abbey and Elvaston Castle. But later, the force said new guidance from the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) had ""clarified the policing response concerning travel and exercise"". The guidance said: ""The Covid regulations which officers enforce and which enables them to issue FPNs [fixed penalty notices] for breaches, do not restrict the distance travelled for exercise."" Mr Dhindsa said: ""It would appear that the force has been a little over-zealous in its interpretation of the guidance. ""While the police can enforce the regulations, guidance is just that which can make this a very challenging and complex situation to police."" The chief constable of neighbouring Nottinghamshire, Craig Guildford, said: ""We are not out and about telling people they have gone too far from home. We trust the public to take these regulations seriously. ""Derbyshire to be fair to them have some unique places that people may want to go to from a load of counties. ""But our approach is around reasonableness. If someone has gone 50 miles, we will take action, if someone has gone a couple of miles we are very sensible.""

Chickens at risk of cull as egg demand drops,"Ben Jackson said the closure of the farm's bulk-buyers like hotels and schools has left thousands of eggs unsold A fall in bulk egg orders due to the lockdown could lead to chickens being culled, a poultry-farmer has warned. Fluffetts Farm near Fordingbridge had been supplying free range eggs to 350 Hampshire schools, but orders stopped when schools suddenly closed. Farm owner, Ben Jackson said: ""If you can't sell the eggs you can't still keep feeding the chickens and therefore something has to give."" He said he hoped to work out a local delivery system to avoid culling birds. Mr Jackson, who has been selling some of the surplus eggs off on social media, has more than 13,000 chickens laying 12,000 eggs each day. The cancellation of his school orders has left him with about 4,000 spare eggs a day. The farm has also been hit by restaurants and pubs closing again. The farm has a surplus of about 4,000 eggs each day from its 13,000 chickens He said: ""If we can't find a home for the eggs the worst-case scenario is that we may have to look to get rid of some of our chickens, but that's what we're trying to avoid. ""Other chicken farmers are in the same situation - they are talking about potentially having to cull birds in the next week or so - it's not a decision that anyone wants to make. ""We just want to get through this dark time - we're just taking it a day at time."" Chickens at the farm are currently in a bird lockdown. Since 14 Decemberstrict biosecurity regulationshave been in place following a number of outbreak of avian influenza throughout England. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

Boeing 737 plane feared crashed in IndonesiaThe passenger plane carrying 62 people is suspected to have plunged into the sea minutes after take-off.Asia,"Relatives of those on board are waiting anxiously for news A Boeing 737 passenger plane carrying 62 people is believed to have crashed into the sea shortly after take-off from Indonesia's capital Jakarta. The Sriwijaya Air disappeared from radars four minutes into its journey to Pontianak in West Kalimantan province. It is thought to have dropped more than 3,000m (10,000ft) in less than a minute, according to flight tracking website Flightradar24.com. Witnesses said they had seen and heard at least one explosion. Fisherman Solihin, who goes by one name, told the BBC Indonesian service he had witnessed a crash and his captain decided to return to land. ""The plane fell like lightning into the sea and exploded in the water,"" he said. ""It was pretty close to us, the shards of a kind of plywood almost hit my ship."" A timeline of global air disasters Plane crash fatalities fell more than 50% in 2019 Mechanical v human: Why do planes crash? A number of residents of an island near where the plane disappeared told the BBC they had found objects they thought were from the plane. Police officers and fishermen show debris that they believe came from the plane Search and rescue efforts were suspended overnight but were due to resume on Sunday. The Indonesian navy was reportedly deployed to look for the aircraft on Saturday. Navy official Abdul Rasyid told Reuters news agency it had determined the plane's coordinates and ships had been deployed to the location. The aircraft is not a 737 Max, the Boeing model that was grounded from March 2019 until last December following two deadly crashes. Last contact with the plane, with the call sign SJY182, was made at 14:40 local time (07:40 GMT), according to the transport ministry. The usual flight time to Pontianak, in the west of the island of Borneo, is 90 minutes. It did not send a distress signal, according to the head of national search and rescue agency Air Marshal Bagus Puruhito. There were thought to be 50 passengers - including seven children and three babies - and 12 crew on board, though the plane has a capacity of 130. Everyone on board was Indonesian, officials say. Relatives of the passengers have been waiting anxiously at the airport in Pontianak, as well as at Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta International Airport. ""I have four family members on the flight - my wife and my three children,"" Yaman Zai told reporters through tears. ""[My wife] sent me a picture of the baby today... How could my heart not be torn into pieces?"" According to registration details, the plane is a 26-year-old Boeing 737-500. It was in good condition, Sriwijaya Air chief executive Jefferson Irwin Jauwena told reporters. Take-off had been delayed for 30 minutes due to heavy rain, he said. Sriwijaya Air, founded in 2003, is a local budget airline which flies to Indonesian and other South-East Asian destinations. The Sriwijaya Air plane disappeared from radar screens shortly after take-off (file photo) The plane went missing about 20km (12 miles) north of the capital Jakarta, not far from where another flight crashed in October 2018. A total of 189 died when an Indonesian Lion Air flight plunged into the sea about 12 minutes after take-off from the city. Boeing 737 Max returns to skies after safety fears Series of failures behind Boeing Lion Air crash Boeing to pay $2.5bn over 737 Max conspiracy That disaster was blamed on a series of failures in the plane's design, but also faults by the airline and the pilots. It was one of two crashes that led regulators to pull the Boeing 737 Max from service. The model resumed passenger flights in December after a systems overhaul. The BBC's Jerome Wirawan in Jakarta says the latest events will bring up difficult questions and emotions in Indonesia, whose airline industry has faced intense scrutiny since the Lion Air crash. The aircraft which appears to have been lost off Indonesia was a Boeing 737, but it should not be confused with the much more modern 737 Max - which was grounded following two tragic accidents in 2018 and 2019, including one off the coast of Indonesia. The Sriwijaya Air flight appears to have been carried out by a Boeing 737-500. This plane formed part of the 737 Classic series, the second generation of 737, which was built during the 1980s and 1990s. The plane, seen as a workhorse aircraft for many years, has a strong safety record. The Sriwijaya Air 737 was 26 years old. While airlines do tend to prefer to fly newer aircraft - because they have lower running costs - it is not uncommon to find planes of this age still in service. Indonesia, though, has a relatively poor record on aviation safety. For more than a decade carriers from the region were banned from flying into the EU. Until recently, the perception had been that standards were improving, and in 2018 all Indonesian airlines were removed from the EU's blacklist. That, however, was before the loss of a Lion Air 737 Max in October 2018. Although the design of the aircraft is widely believed to have been the main cause of the accident, investigators also highlighted issues such as poor maintenance procedures and inadequate flying skills as contributory factors.

Police officers clashed with some of the maskless protesters who arrived in Clapham Common, some shouting ""take your freedom back"". Six police vans were deployed to the scene while officers moved the crowd of about 30 people away from the area. Gathering for the purpose of a protest is not an exemption to the rules, the Met Police said.

"Lockdown needs to be stricter, scientists warnThe new more infectious variant requires tougher measures to control the spread of Covid, say scientists.UKRelated contentWhat's allowed in lockdown?How many cases in you area?Can lockdown stop the new variant?","Lockdown measures in England need to be stricter to achieve the same impact as the March shutdown, scientists advising the government have said. Prof Robert West said the current rules were ""still allowing a lot of activity which is spreading the virus"". Prof Susan Michie also said the spread of the new more infectious variant meant the restrictions were ""too lax"". The government said it had adapted its approach and taken ""swift action"" to try and stop the spread of the virus. The warnings come after ministers launched a new campaignurging people to act like they have the virus. Meanwhile, Buckingham Palace has said the Queen, 94, and the Duke of Edinburgh, 99,received Covid-19 vaccinationson Saturday. Under the national lockdown, people in England must stay at home and can only go out for essential reasons. Similar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live What's still allowed during lockdown? Hospital staff 'cannot go on like this' Analysis: Can lockdown stop the new variant? Prof West, a participant in the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours (SPI-B), which advises the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said the new variant of Covid is around 50% more infectious compared to the virus that infected people last March. ""That means that if we were to achieve the same result as we got in March we would have to have a stricter lockdown, and it's not stricter,"" he said The professor of health psychology at University College London, also told the BBC more children were going to school, compared to the first lockdown and he said schools were ""a very important seed of community infection"". More people are in schools, after the Department for Education has widened the categories of vulnerable and key worker pupils allowed to attend,with attendance rates surging to 50% in some places. Prof Michie, who is also a member of Sage, agreed the current lockdown was ""too lax"". ""When you look at the data, it shows that almost 90% of people are overwhelmingly adhering to the rules - despite the fact that we're also seeing more people out and about,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. She said in comparison to the first lockdown last spring more people were allowed to go out to work and children's nurseries were open, making public transport busier. The number of people travelling by public transport in London has decreased since the latest national lockdown began, with tube journeys now at 18% of the pre-pandemic demand and bus journeys at 30%, according to figures from Transport for London. However, during the first lockdown passenger numbers fell below 10% at some points. Prof Michie, a professor of health psychology at University College London, added that the winter season posed extra challenges because the virus survives longer in the cold and people spend more time indoors, where the virus can spread more easily. Combined with the more transmissible new variant, she said ""we should have a stricter rather than less strict lockdown than we had back in March"". LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? YOUR QUESTIONS:We answer your queries GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Scientists believe the new variant spreads between 50 and 70% faster compared to previous forms of the virus. Dr Adam Kucharski, another scientist advising the government and an associate professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that because the new variant was more transmissible ""each interaction we have has become riskier than it was before"". He said that even if people reduced their contacts to levels seen last spring, it would not have the same effect on virus transmission. Prof Kevin Fenton, London regional director for Public Health England, said there were ""things we could do better"" to reduce the number of infections, including greater compliance with mask wearing and social distancing when shopping and using public transport. On Friday1,325 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test were recorded in the UK- the highest daily figure yet - along with 68,053 new cases. As cases and deaths soar, the government has launched an advertising campaign, which will be shared across television, radio, newspapers and on social media, urging people to stay at home and not to get complacent. Government sources say there is also likely to be more focus from police on enforcing rather than explaining rules. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It comes after London's mayor Sadiq Khan said the spread of coronavirus was ""out of control""as he declared a ""major incident"" in the capital on Friday. Dr Simon Walsh, an emergency care doctor in London, told BBC Breakfast the ""unprecedented"" numbers of patients requiring intensive care treatment meant staff were spread ""more and more thinly"". Hospitals in other parts of the UK are also under pressure. Dr Justin Varney, director of public health in Birmingham, said he was ""very worried"" about the situation in the city, where hospital bosses have warned they do not have enough intensive care nurses to deal with the growing case load.

""When you look at the data, it shows that almost 90% of people are overwhelmingly adhering to the rules - despite the fact that we're also seeing more people out and about,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. She said, in comparison to the first lockdown in spring 2020, more people were allowed to go out to work and children's nurseries were open, making public transport busier. The number of people travelling by public transport in London has decreased since the latest national lockdown began, with tube journeys now at 18% of the pre-pandemic demand and bus journeys at 30%, according to figures from Transport for London. However, during the first lockdown passenger numbers fell below 10% at some points. Scientists believe the new variant spreads between 50 and 70% faster compared to previous forms of the virus. Prof Kevin Fenton, London regional director for Public Health England, said there were ""things we could do better"" to reduce the number of infections, including greater compliance with mask wearing and social distancing when shopping and using public transport. Torsten Bell, chief executive of the Resolution Foundation think tank, told BBC Radio 4's PM programme that the UK's statutory sick pay system was ""not fit for purpose for a pandemic"" and more effective measures to encourage people to isolate were needed.

"Gym owners fined for breaching Covid-19 rulesThe gym owners were given a Â£1,000 fine after three people were found inside on Friday.London","Three people were found inside the gym in Stean Street in Hackney on Friday The owners of a London gym have been fined for breaching Covid-19 rules by remaining open during lockdown. Police were called to the fitness centre in Stean Street, Hackney, on Friday to reports of a regulation breach. Three people were found inside the gym at 09:30 GMT. The owners were given a Â£1,000 fixed penalty notice. It comes as a""major incident"" was declared as the spread of Covid-19threatens to ""overwhelm"" its hospitals. City Hall said Covid-19 cases in London had exceeded 1,000 per 100,000, while there are 35% more people in hospital with the virus than in the peak of the pandemic in April.

It says it's because of the likelihood of him inciting violence in the future. But it's also because his power is very quickly slipping away.

Boeing 737 passenger plane missing in Indonesia,"Relatives of those on board are waiting anxiously for news A Boeing 737 passenger plane carrying 62 people is believed to have crashed into the sea shortly after take-off from Indonesia's capital Jakarta. The Sriwijaya Air disappeared from radars four minutes into its journey to Pontianak in West Kalimantan province. It is thought to have dropped more than 3,000m (10,000ft) in less than a minute, according to flight tracking website Flightradar24.com. Witnesses said they had seen and heard at least one explosion. Fisherman Solihin, who goes by one name, told the BBC Indonesian service he had witnessed a crash and his captain decided to return to land. ""The plane fell like lightning into the sea and exploded in the water,"" he said. ""It was pretty close to us, the shards of a kind of plywood almost hit my ship."" A timeline of global air disasters Plane crash fatalities fell more than 50% in 2019 Mechanical v human: Why do planes crash? A number of residents of an island near where the plane disappeared told the BBC they had found objects they thought were from the plane. Police officers and fishermen show debris that they believe came from the plane Search and rescue efforts were suspended overnight but were due to resume on Sunday. The Indonesian navy was reportedly deployed to look for the aircraft on Saturday. Navy official Abdul Rasyid told Reuters news agency it had determined the plane's coordinates and ships had been deployed to the location. The aircraft is not a 737 Max, the Boeing model that was grounded from March 2019 until last December following two deadly crashes. Last contact with the plane, with the call sign SJY182, was made at 14:40 local time (07:40 GMT), according to the transport ministry. The usual flight time to Pontianak, in the west of the island of Borneo, is 90 minutes. It did not send a distress signal, according to the head of national search and rescue agency Air Marshal Bagus Puruhito. There were thought to be 50 passengers - including seven children and three babies - and 12 crew on board, though the plane has a capacity of 130. Everyone on board was Indonesian, officials say. Relatives of the passengers have been waiting anxiously at the airport in Pontianak, as well as at Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta International Airport. ""I have four family members on the flight - my wife and my three children,"" Yaman Zai told reporters through tears. ""[My wife] sent me a picture of the baby today... How could my heart not be torn into pieces?"" According to registration details, the plane is a 26-year-old Boeing 737-500. It was in good condition, Sriwijaya Air chief executive Jefferson Irwin Jauwena told reporters. Take-off had been delayed for 30 minutes due to heavy rain, he said. Sriwijaya Air, founded in 2003, is a local budget airline which flies to Indonesian and other South-East Asian destinations. The Sriwijaya Air plane disappeared from radar screens shortly after take-off (file photo) The plane went missing about 20km (12 miles) north of the capital Jakarta, not far from where another flight crashed in October 2018. A total of 189 died when an Indonesian Lion Air flight plunged into the sea about 12 minutes after take-off from the city. Boeing 737 Max returns to skies after safety fears Series of failures behind Boeing Lion Air crash Boeing to pay $2.5bn over 737 Max conspiracy That disaster was blamed on a series of failures in the plane's design, but also faults by the airline and the pilots. It was one of two crashes that led regulators to pull the Boeing 737 Max from service. The model resumed passenger flights in December after a systems overhaul. The BBC's Jerome Wirawan in Jakarta says the latest events will bring up difficult questions and emotions in Indonesia, whose airline industry has faced intense scrutiny since the Lion Air crash. The aircraft which appears to have been lost off Indonesia was a Boeing 737, but it should not be confused with the much more modern 737 Max - which was grounded following two tragic accidents in 2018 and 2019, including one off the coast of Indonesia. The Sriwijaya Air flight appears to have been carried out by a Boeing 737-500. This plane formed part of the 737 Classic series, the second generation of 737, which was built during the 1980s and 1990s. The plane, seen as a workhorse aircraft for many years, has a strong safety record. The Sriwijaya Air 737 was 26 years old. While airlines do tend to prefer to fly newer aircraft - because they have lower running costs - it is not uncommon to find planes of this age still in service. Indonesia, though, has a relatively poor record on aviation safety. For more than a decade carriers from the region were banned from flying into the EU. Until recently, the perception had been that standards were improving, and in 2018 all Indonesian airlines were removed from the EU's blacklist. That, however, was before the loss of a Lion Air 737 Max in October 2018. Although the design of the aircraft is widely believed to have been the main cause of the accident, investigators also highlighted issues such as poor maintenance procedures and inadequate flying skills as contributory factors.

"Lockdown needs to be stricter, scientists warn","Lockdown measures in England need to be stricter to achieve the same impact as the March shutdown, scientists advising the government have said. Prof Robert West said the current rules were ""still allowing a lot of activity which is spreading the virus"". Prof Susan Michie also said the spread of the new more infectious variant meant the restrictions were ""too lax"". The government said it had adapted its approach and taken ""swift action"" to try and stop the spread of the virus. The warnings come after ministers launched a new campaignurging people to act like they have the virus. Meanwhile, Buckingham Palace has said the Queen, 94, and the Duke of Edinburgh, 99,received Covid-19 vaccinationson Saturday. Under the national lockdown, people in England must stay at home and can only go out for essential reasons. Similar measures are in place across much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live What's still allowed during lockdown? Hospital staff 'cannot go on like this' Analysis: Can lockdown stop the new variant? Prof West, a participant in the Scientific Pandemic Influenza Group on Behaviours (SPI-B), which advises the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies (Sage), said the new variant of Covid is around 50% more infectious compared to the virus that infected people last March. ""That means that if we were to achieve the same result as we got in March we would have to have a stricter lockdown, and it's not stricter,"" he said The professor of health psychology at University College London, also told the BBC more children were going to school, compared to the first lockdown and he said schools were ""a very important seed of community infection"". More people are in schools, after the Department for Education has widened the categories of vulnerable and key worker pupils allowed to attend,with attendance rates surging to 50% in some places. Prof Michie, who is also a member of Sage, agreed the current lockdown was ""too lax"". ""When you look at the data, it shows that almost 90% of people are overwhelmingly adhering to the rules - despite the fact that we're also seeing more people out and about,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. She said in comparison to the first lockdown last spring more people were allowed to go out to work and children's nurseries were open, making public transport busier. The number of people travelling by public transport in London has decreased since the latest national lockdown began, with tube journeys now at 18% of the pre-pandemic demand and bus journeys at 30%, according to figures from Transport for London. However, during the first lockdown passenger numbers fell below 10% at some points. Prof Michie, a professor of health psychology at University College London, added that the winter season posed extra challenges because the virus survives longer in the cold and people spend more time indoors, where the virus can spread more easily. Combined with the more transmissible new variant, she said ""we should have a stricter rather than less strict lockdown than we had back in March"". LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

THE R NUMBER:What it means and why it matters Scientists believe the new variant spreads between 50 and 70% faster compared to previous forms of the virus. Dr Adam Kucharski, another scientist advising the government and an associate professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that because the new variant was more transmissible ""each interaction we have has become riskier than it was before"". He said that even if people reduced their contacts to levels seen last spring, it would not have the same effect on virus transmission. Prof Kevin Fenton, London regional director for Public Health England, said there were ""things we could do better"" to reduce the number of infections, including greater compliance with mask wearing and social distancing when shopping and using public transport. On Friday1,325 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test were recorded in the UK- the highest daily figure yet - along with 68,053 new cases. As cases and deaths soar, the government has launched an advertising campaign, which will be shared across television, radio, newspapers and on social media, urging people to stay at home and not to get complacent. Government sources say there is also likely to be more focus from police on enforcing rather than explaining rules. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Prime Minister Boris Johnson says hospitals are ""under more pressure than at any other time since the start of the pandemic"", with infection rates increasing at an ""alarming rate"" across the country and the NHS under ""severe strain"". It comes after London's mayor Sadiq Khan said the spread of coronavirus was ""out of control""as he declared a ""major incident"" in the capital on Friday. Dr Simon Walsh, an emergency care doctor in London, told BBC Breakfast the ""unprecedented"" numbers of patients requiring intensive care treatment meant staff were spread ""more and more thinly"". Hospitals in other parts of the UK are also under pressure. Dr Justin Varney, director of public health in Birmingham, said he was ""very worried"" about the situation in the city, where hospital bosses have warned they do not have enough intensive care nurses to deal with the growing case load. He warned that the NHS had still not seen the impact of the rise in cases following the relaxation of restrictions over Christmas and added: ""It is going to get a lot, lot worse unless we really get this under control"". A government spokesperson said: ""Our priority from the outset has been to protect the NHS to save lives and we have taken advice from scientific and medical experts throughout. As new evidence has emerged, we have adapted our approach and taken swift action to try and stop the spread of the virus.""

"Scots Covid hospital numbers at new highA total of 1,596 Scots are being treated for Covid in hospital - the highest daily tally.Scotland","The number of people being treated in Scotland's hospitals for coronavirus has reached another record daily high. Latest Scottish government figures show a total of 1,596 people are in hospital with recently confirmed Covid. This is up from Friday's figure of 1,530 patients. The deaths of a further 93 people who had tested positive for the virus have been recorded in the past 24 hours, the same tally as Friday which was the highest daily figure of the pandemic. It is the second day in a row there has been a record figure for Covid hospital patients. Of the 1,596 people in hospital, a total of 109 are in intensive care, up seven on Friday's figure. Tesco staff 'devastated' at deaths of two colleagues Police warn against lockdown protest Where are the latest cases? National clinical director Prof Jason Leitch said Scotland's hospitals were ""very busy and fragile"" but coping so far. He said: ""People should not be worried we have reached capacity but the best way of getting those numbers down is to reduce the prevalence of the virus."" Prof Leitch said the NHS could create more intensive care capacity if needed but ""all of that has a cost in what we won't be able to do"" elsewhere in the health service. TheNHS Louisa Jordan temporary hospital in Glasgowcan be used to care for the sickest of Covid patients if the spike in admissions continues, but officials are trying to avoid this ""if we can manage without it"", Prof Leitch added. This is because it is better for patients and staff for Covid patients to be in traditional intensive care units, he explained. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has described the latest Covid figures as ""a big concern"". On Twitter, she said: ""Covid case numbers still a big concern and putting huge pressure on the NHS, as hospital and ICU cases increase. ""Also, 93 further deaths remind us just how dangerous the virus can be - my thoughts are with all those grieving.""] The Scottish government data shows a further 1,865 new cases of Covid have been reported in the last 24 hours, down from the 2,309 cases reported on Friday. However, the daily test positivity rate is 8.7%, up from 8.1% on the previous day. LEVELS:What are the restrictions in your area?

Are Covid patients getting younger?,"Since the end of the second lockdown in England, the numbers of people being admitted to hospital with Covid have been rising quickly on a daily basis. Some healthcare staff say they are seeing younger patients, so what does the data show? There are more people of all ages in hospital with Covid now than in the first wave last spring - that includes the young and old. Infections have been highest in teenagers, students and people in their 20s and 30s in recent months. A small percentage of people from these age groups inevitably end up in hospital needing treatment. But the overall pattern of those at risk of becoming seriously ill or dying has not changed significantly. The older someone is, the greater their risk from Covid-19 - particularly over the age of 65. For people under 40 who are infected, their risk of death is 0.1%. This rises to more than 5% for people over 80, according to Imperial College London research on the first wave. 'How long can we keep going like this? About a week' This is equivalent to the risk of death from Covid doubling approximately every eight years of ageing. Better treatments, greater knowledge of how the disease progresses and the rollout of vaccines should all improve these figures in the second wave. Since the start of the second wave in late September, the highest hospital admission rate for confirmed Covid-19 has been in the over-85s, followed by 75 to 84-year-olds. Children and young adults have consistently seen the lowest rates. Compared with the first wave in the spring, more children and adults in all age groups have been admitted to hospital with the virus, creating pressure on the NHS during an already busy winter. Coronavirus, schools and children - what are the risks? 'Significantly' more children with Covid in second wave ""Children's wards are usually busy in winter,"" Prof Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, said recently. ""As cases in the community rise, there will be a small increase in the number of children we see with Covid-19, but the overwhelming majority of children and young people have no symptoms or very mild illness only."" Although people in middle age are less affected than the over-65s, they are by no means risk-free. In the last few weeks, for example, adults aged 18-64 have accounted for 40% of daily Covid admissions to hospitals, data from Public Health England shows. This compares to 40% for 65-84 year olds and 20% for the over-85s. And there has been a steep rise in the numbers of people in their mid-40s to mid-60s becoming seriously ill with Covid and being admitted to intensive care units. There has also been a slight increase among younger adults too, although fewer than one in 100,000 was critically ill with Covid in December. In contrast, children under 17 make up a very small percentage of those admitted to hospital with Covid - around 1% - and it is extremely unlikely they will need intensive care treatment. The ages of people who have died with Covid-19 since June show the huge impact on older age groups and the rarity of a Covid death in the under-30s. But there have been some during the pandemic. Twenty-seven deaths have occurred among under-19s who tested positive for Covid-19, according to NHS England, and 317 among 20 to 39-year-olds. More than 80% had an underlying health condition, such as heart disease or type 2 diabetes, which may have increased their risk. Dr Nick Scriven, a former president of the Society for Acute Medicine, says he has seen a patient in their 20s requiring oxygen treatment but most were in their mid-40s, 50s and above - and the most seriously ill were over 50. ""They are not very different ages to the first wave,"" he says, although people are surviving for longer and fewer are being put on ventilators. In intensive care, the average age of Covid patients in the second wave is 60.2 compared with 58.8 in the first wave. According to analysis of 10,000 patients in intensive care in the last four months of 2020, men are around twice as likely as women to end up critically ill with Covid, from the age of 40 upwards. While most seriously-ill men in intensive care were in their 60s, around 15% were in their 50s and 8% in their 40s. The new variant, which is thought to be more transmissible than previous forms of the virus, is behind the recent sharp rise in cases. It appears to affect people of all ages - but there is no evidence it makes people more seriously ill with Covid-19, including children and young people. 'How long can we keep going like this?

"Breaking|Breaking newsQueen and Prince Philip vaccinated against CovidThe Queen and Duke of Edinburgh have received Covid-19 vaccinations, Buckingham Palace says.UK","The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have received Covid-19 vaccinations, Buckingham Palace has said. A royal source said the vaccinations were administered on Saturday by a household doctor at Windsor Castle. The source added the Queen decided to let it be known she had the vaccination to prevent further speculation. The Queen, 94, and Prince Philip, 99, are among around 1.5 million people in the UK to have had at least one dose of a Covid vaccine so far. People aged over 80 in the UK are among the high-priority groups who are being given the vaccine first. The couple have been spending the lockdown in England at their Windsor Castle home after deciding to have a quiet Christmas at their Berkshire residence, instead of the traditional royal family gathering at Sandringham. When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? Europe's slow start: How many have had the jab? Pfizer vaccine 'works' against key variant mutation Last month,the Queen appeared alongside several other senior members of the royal familyfor the first time since the coronavirus pandemic began. In 2020 she went seven months - between March and October -without carrying out public engagementsoutside of a royal residence. During that time, her eldest child,Prince Charles, 72, contracted coronavirusand displayed mild symptoms. Palace sources also told the BBC that her grandsonPrince William tested positive in April- although Kensington Palace refused to comment officially. The Queen made a private pilgrimage to the grave of the Unknown Warrior in Westminster Abbey in November The Queen used her Christmas Day messageto reassure anyone struggling without friends and family this year that they ""are not alone"". She said the pandemic had ""brought us closer"" despite causing hardship, adding that the Royal Family has been ""inspired"" by people volunteering in their communities. On Friday a third coronavirus vaccine - made by US company Moderna -was approved for use in the UK,joining the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines already approved by UK regulators. It is not known which vaccine the Queen and Prince Philip have received. All the approved vaccines require two doses to provide the best possible protection, with the second dose being given up to 12 weeks after the first. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the aim is to vaccinate 15 million people in the UK by mid-February, including care home residents and staff, frontline NHS staff, everyone over 70 and those who have been categorised as clinically extremely vulnerable.

"Lockdown go-ahead for angling welcomedThousands more people have taken up fishing during the pandemic, figures show.England","Fishing ""clears the mind of other worries"" says John Ellis from the Canal and Rivers Trust Anglers have hailed the mental health benefits of the sport after it was given the all-clear to continue, despite lockdown. The government said it would be treated as a form of exercise, but subject to restrictions such as social distancing. Regulations mean people in England must stay at homeexcept for specific purposes, including exercise, shopping for essentials and childcare. Figures show thousands more people havetaken up fishing during the pandemic,external. John Ellis, national fisheries and angling manager for the Canal and Rivers Trust, saidrod licence sales increased by 17% over the last year, the equivalent of about 100,000,externalpeople - some new to the sport and others returning. He said, despite the colder weather which usually causes a drop in fishing, there are more people out than in a typical January. ""It is certainly one of few things people can do legally, can do locally,"" he said. Spencer Moore said it was easy to maintain social distance while fishing Under current restrictions in England, anglers must fish alone, or with members of their household, and must not travel outside their local area. The government regulations permit people to meet for exercise, butnot ""for recreational or leisure purposes"",external. The Department for Culture Media and Sport told the BBC while angling could continue, overarching government guidance meant people should minimise time spent outside their homes. What's still allowed during lockdown? Women on exercise trip 'surrounded by police' Staying positive through the lockdown Mr Ellis said he had received emails from parents pleased their children could go fishing at the weekend, adding that for some people it was linked to their mental wellbeing. ""When you are focussing on fishing, it is very hard to think about anything else, it clears the mind of other worries, at least temporarily,"" he said. Headway said fishing was one of its most popular sporting activities for clients Headway Birmingham & Solihull, a charity which helps people living with brain injuries, runs regular fishing sessions, which were very popular with its clients. ""It encourages them to be more active and get some fresh air out in the countryside,"" she said. ""It also helps their motivation and mental wellbeing, giving them something to look forward to each week, something to talk about and a chance to form friendships with others who enjoy fishing too."" Spencer Moore, a bailiff for Blackfords Progressive Angling Society, based in South Staffordshire, said the sport was perfect for social distancing. ""There are people furloughed, sitting in their house or working from home, but at least they can fish and can get out and wind down,"" he said. ""Being a fisherman, you are on your own on your peg. Someone might be on another peg, but they can be 20 to 30ft away, so you are nowhere near anyone else."" Chris Wood advised people to speak to their local angling club before going fishing for the first time Chris Wood, from Shrewsbury Anglers Club, said the group had seen a definite ""upsurge"" in interest during the pandemic. But, he said, it had also seen an increase in illegal fishing by people who were not aware of the proper permits needed.

"Breaking|Breaking newsQueen and Prince Philip vaccinated against CovidThe Queen and Duke of Edinburgh have received Covid-19 vaccinations, Buckingham Palace says.UKAberfan survivor dies with Covid-19, aged 63Bernard Thomas was rescued from the rubble of Pantglas primary school on 21 October, 1966.Wales","The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have received Covid-19 vaccinations, Buckingham Palace has said. A royal source said the vaccinations were administered on Saturday by a household doctor at Windsor Castle. The source added the Queen decided to let it be known she had the vaccination to prevent further speculation. The Queen, 94, and Prince Philip, 99, are among around 1.5 million people in the UK to have had at least one dose of a Covid vaccine so far. People aged over 80 in the UK are among the high-priority groups who are being given the vaccine first. The couple have been spending the lockdown in England at their Windsor Castle home after deciding to have a quiet Christmas at their Berkshire residence, instead of the traditional royal family gathering at Sandringham. When will you be eligible for the Covid vaccine? Europe's slow start: How many have had the jab? Pfizer vaccine 'works' against key variant mutation Last month,the Queen appeared alongside several other senior members of the royal familyfor the first time since the coronavirus pandemic began. In 2020 she went seven months - between March and October -without carrying out public engagementsoutside of a royal residence. During that time, her eldest child,Prince Charles, 72, contracted coronavirusand displayed mild symptoms. Palace sources also told the BBC that her grandsonPrince William tested positive in April- although Kensington Palace refused to comment officially. The Queen made a private pilgrimage to the grave of the Unknown Warrior in Westminster Abbey in November The Queen used her Christmas Day messageto reassure anyone struggling without friends and family this year that they ""are not alone"". She said the pandemic had ""brought us closer"" despite causing hardship, adding that the Royal Family has been ""inspired"" by people volunteering in their communities. On Friday a third coronavirus vaccine - made by US company Moderna -was approved for use in the UK,joining the Pfizer-BioNTech and Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines already approved by UK regulators. It is not known which vaccine the Queen and Prince Philip have received. All the approved vaccines require two doses to provide the best possible protection, with the second dose being given up to 12 weeks after the first. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the aim is to vaccinate 15 million people in the UK by mid-February, including care home residents and staff, frontline NHS staff, everyone over 70 and those who have been categorised as clinically extremely vulnerable.

"Covid: Wales 'ready to vaccinate at a higher rate'There's ""light at the end of the tunnel"" but people need to keep safe until getting a jab, health boss says.Wales","The number of Covid patients in critical care is at its highest point since the first wave peak in April There is a ""light at the end of the tunnel"" with a third vaccination against Covid-19 but people need to keep safe in the meantime. That's the message from the body representing health boards in Wales. There are more than 2,700 patients in hospital with Covid, according to latest NHS Wales figures. ""It's incredibly serious at the moment, I can't emphasise that enough,"" said Welsh NHS confederation director Darren Hughes. There were more than 1,700 confirmed and suspected Covid-19 patients in Welsh hospitals at the most recent count, on Thursday. There were also another 1,000 patients in hospital beds recovering from the virus. Both are at record levels. The number of Covid patients in critical care is also at its highest point since the first wave peak in April. On Saturday,Public Health Wales reported a further 62 deaths with Covidover recent days, taking the total number since the start of the pandemic to 3,919. On New Year's Day, 55 people died - the highest for a single day during the pandemic. Meanwhile,a new report from the Welsh Government's scientific advisory body,externalsuggests there are ""significant numbers"" of the faster-spreading new variant of Covid in north Wales, particularly in Wrexham and Flintshire. It estimates up to two-thirds of cases in the Betsi Cadwaladr health board area are of this type. There was some suggestion it was increasing in south Wales, including Cardiff and Vale health board. ""If the new variant grows in Wales as it has in London, east and south-east England, it will bring a period of significant further increased pressure on the NHS,"" the report warned. ""In intensive care we're running at about 165% of normal capacity, we've got, you know, getting on for 3,000 people now in hospital with Covid or recovering from Covid,"" Mr Hughes toldBBC Radio Wales Breakfast. One consultant at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital near Llantrisant, Rhondda Cynon Taff,told BBC Wales of the pressuresand that ""we're definitely having more younger people with Covid that are becoming sick, the volume is very high in the community"". Mr Hughes described the vaccination rollout programme as a ""huge undertaking"" for staff already under pressure due to the health service's workload. ""If you look at the headline figures,Wales is slightly behind other parts of the UK, but I think it's important to remember that the vaccine has been delivered by healthcare staff,"" he said. ""What we are doing is vaccinating everybody and delivering the vaccines that have been delivered to Wales."" How many have died with Covid in Wales? Nurse's 'overwhelming fear' as 13 ambulances queue Mr Hughes said: ""Things are being ramped up from what I understand from the sort of 25,000 vaccinations being delivered to Wales, to go to much higher numbers in the coming weeks. ""We are ready to vaccinate at a much higher rate as soon as the vaccines become available, and good news yesterday that athird vaccineis coming on stream, pretty much straight away."" He added: ""We understand how tough it is for all of us in our families living in Wales; people directly affected, businesses affected, people's mental health affected. ""There is a light at the end of the tunnel with a vaccination coming online but please do all you can to keep yourselves and your family safe so that we in the NHS can can look after you all.""

Marcia Sturk receives her vaccine at a special clinic on Saturday About 100 patients in Swansea Bay got their first vaccine dose, when the Killay medical centre held a clinic on Saturday. Among the first in line was 82-year-old Marcia Sturk, who said she was ""happy to take advantage of the opportunity"" to receive the vaccine. There are about 1,800 patients aged over 80 on the surgery's list alone, and across the health board area, there are around 24,000 in that age group who should receive a first dose in the next few weeks. Surgeries will be contacting patients directly, by telephone or letter, to arrange an appointment. Wales' vaccine programme 'not a competition' Third Covid vaccine approved in the UK GP Dr Chris Johns said: ""We are very pleased to be involved and begin these vaccinations. It feels like it's been a long time coming, but we've started at last. ""We will be vaccinating 100 people today and as well as holding special clinics in the surgery we are also looking at using some community venues as well to help us get around everyone."" Meanwhile, Cwm Taf Morgannwg said 808 doses had been given at care homes in its area so far, with another 954 planned for next week. More than 300 have also been vaccinated at GP practices across the health board, with a further 3,000 planned for next week. In Denbighshire, Vale of Clwyd Conservative MP Dr James Davies said he had been ""inundated with messages from understandably anxious elderly constituents and relatives of care home residents who have seen those in their position being vaccinated in nearby Cheshire, Wirral and Shropshire, but are yet to receive an invitation for vaccination themselves"". Betsi Cadwaladr health board, which manages the health service in north Wales, said it had received5,000 doses of the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine,externalthis week to vaccinate care home staff and residents, as well as hospital inpatients and those over the age of 80. It said 300 people aged over 80 would be vaccinated at mass vaccination centres this week, and arrangements had been made to contact individuals by telephone. The first minister has said the""ambition""is for the top priority groups in Wales to get Covid vaccines by mid-February. Prof Andrew Easton, an expert on virology at the University of Warwick, said the global spread of coronavirus could mean society has to ""live with the virus rather than to hope for its removal"", similar to flu. ""It has gone so far around the world that eliminating it is going to be almost impossible, not entirely"" he said. ""So we will have to learn to live with it,"" he said, adding that improved hygiene habits such as wearing face masks may need to continue into the future.

'I've relied on parents to keep my family afloat',"Andy Stonely is not eligible for the UK government Covid support scheme A father who has lived on Universal Credit since the Covid-19 pandemic started has called on the UK government to be ""more flexible"" with its support. Driving instructor and dad-of-three Andy Stonely is not eligible for the government's Covid support scheme. The Federation of Small Businesses Wales has also asked for changes ahead of the next round of grants. The Treasury said itsSelf-Employment Income Support Scheme,externalwas ""one of the most generous in the world"". This scheme requires claimants to show accounts for the 2018-19 year as well as 2019-20. Can I go on furlough to look after my children? What help can self-employed people get? Business offered new grants to survive lockdown However, Mr Stonely from Newport hasn't been self-employed for long enough to qualify - so the 35-year-old has had to rely on financial support from his parents. ""I count myself somewhat lucky because I have been able to claim for Universal Credit,"" he said. ""But obviously it's minimal and luckily through the help of parents I've been able to keep afloat. ""It's been tough. It would have been ideal if the government was just slightly more flexible."" Mr Stonely, who hasn't been able to work for much of the past year due to lockdown restrictions, said Universal Credit was worth ""less than half"" of his normal earnings. Driving school firm owner Gareth Denny said almost a quarter of his drivers can't claim Covid help The coronavirus crisis forced his wife to give up her job to look after their three children, aged three, six and 17, when Mr Stonely was able to work for a short period at the end of the initial lockdown period. Asked how much longer his family could sustain itself if the current restrictions continue, Mr Stonely told theBBC's Politics Wales show:  ""Not too much longerâ¦ we're going to be in a very tough situation."" Mr Stonely is part of a local driving school franchise managed by Gareth Denny, who said 11 of his 43 instructors were in this position. ""If you imagine that somebody lives their life to their income and suddenly there's absolutely no income to pay their mortgage and their bills, Universal Credit simply doesn't pay most people's mortgage,"" Mr Denny said. Recent research,externalcommissioned by the Community and Prospect trade unions and the Federation of Small Businesses found 53% of self-employed people across the UK had lost more than 60% of their income since the pandemic began. In addition, 64% of people said they were now either ""unsure"" or ""less likely"" to want to be self-employed or freelance in the future. 'It has been the toughest year I've ever had' The 'anger, hope, despair' of the self-employed What's still allowed during lockdown? ""These are normal people who have mortgages, families to support, who've just had to fund a Christmas for the families,"" said Ben Francis of Federation of Small Businesses Wales. ""All those bills are now mounting up the other side of Christmas, and after having an already extremely difficult 12 months, they've now got to see how they manage through the months ahead. ""We would ask UK government to be flexible in their approach to verifying the statuses of these newly self-employed businesses."" The Community union warns with small businesses ""struggling to get back on their feet"", more people will leave self-employment. All non-essential businesses shut in Wales just before Christmas ""That will be a disaster for our economy, for local economies, for their livelihoods and their families,"" said Kate Dearden of Community. ""This section of the UK workforce plays a fundamental role and should be properly supported to continue to do so."" The Treasury has already committed to extending the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme until April 2021, although the eligibility criteria for the next round of grants is yet to be published. A spokesman said the scheme had ""helped more than 2.7 million people so far, claiming over Â£13.7bn"". He added: ""Funding is designed to target those who need it most and protect the taxpayer against fraud and abuse. ""Those not eligible may still be able to access our loans schemes, tax deferrals, mortgage holidays and business support grants.""

"Act like you've got the virus, government urges","People in England are being told to act like they have got Covid as part of a government advertising campaign aimed at tackling the rise in infections. Boris Johnson said the public should ""stay at home"" and not get complacent. On Friday1,325 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test were recorded in the UK- the highest daily figure yet - along with 68,053 new cases. Government sources say there is likely to be more focus from police on enforcing rather than explaining rules. ""With over 1,000 people dying yesterday it's more important than ever everyone sticks to rules,"" a source told the BBC. As cases and deaths soar, the government is releasing its advertising campaign, which will be shared across television, radio, newspapers and on social media. England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, says in the advert: ""Vaccines give clear hope for the future, but for now we must all stay home, protect the NHS and save lives.""

Prime Minister Boris Johnson says hospitals are ""under more pressure than at any other time since the start of the pandemic"", with infection rates increasing at an ""alarming rate"" across the country and the NHS under ""severe strain"". It comes after London's mayor Sadiq Khan said the spread of coronavirus was ""out of control"" as he declared a ""major incident"" in the capital on Friday. Such an incident is an emergency that requires the implementation of special arrangements by one or all of the emergency services, the NHS or the local authority. It means the emergency services and hospitals cannot guarantee their normal level of response. What can police do to enforce lockdown rules? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live Hospital staff 'cannot go on like this' While the government seeks to reinforce its ""stay at home"" message, some police forces have faced criticism for their approaches to tackling potential breaches of coronavirus restrictions. Derbyshire Police has said it will review fixed penalties issued during the new national lockdown after two women were ordered to pay Â£200 eachafter driving five miles from their home for a walk on Wednesday. Susan Michie, a professor of health psychology at University College London, said ""more support and enablement"" was needed for people to adhere to the regulations, for example support to help people self-isolate, rather than punishment. Prof Michie, who sits on a subcommittee of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, also said the current restrictions were ""too lax"". ""When you look at the data, it shows that almost 90% of people are overwhelmingly adhering to the rules despite the fact that we're also seeing more people out and about,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. However, she said in comparison to the first lockdown last spring the restrictions were less strict, with more people allowed to go out to work and children's nurseries open, meaning public transport is busier. The number of people travelling by public transport in London has decreased since the latest national lockdown began, with tube journeys now at 18% pre-pandemic demand and bus journeys at 30%, according to figures from Transport for London. However, during the first lockdown passenger numbers fell below 10% at some points. Prof Michie added that the winter season posed extra challenges because the virus survives longer in the cold and people spend more time indoors, where the virus can spread more easily. Combined with the more transmissible new variant, she said ""we should have a stricter rather than less strict lockdown than we had back in March"". Dr Adam Kucharski, another scientist advising the government and an associate professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that because the new variant was more transmissible ""each interaction we have has become riskier than it was before"". ""So even if we went back to that kind of last spring level of reduction in contacts we couldn't be confident that we would see the same effect that we saw last year because of this increased transmission,"" he said. England, much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland continue to be under strict national measures, with stay-at-home orders in place for most people. There is considerable concern in government about the continued spread of the virus. No 10 believes more needs to be done to emphasise how severe the current situation is - which is why we are getting some very stark warnings from the medical experts. Ministers continue to praise the public - but there is also more emphasis on people taking the rules seriously, as was the case last spring when the first lockdown was imposed. The prime minister warns people against complacency, saying: ""Your compliance is now more vital than ever"". This video can not be played Staff at Portsmouth's Queen Alexandra Hospital are struggling to cope with an increase in the number of Covid-19 patients Latest figures from Public Health England reveal the coronavirus infection rate in London has exceeded 1,000 per 100,000 people. The Office for National Statistics recently estimatedas many as one in 30 Londoners has coronavirus,external. London councils have urged places of worship to close and the bishop of London Sarah Mullally said churches should ""consider the seriousness of the situation"" before holding in person services this weekend. Dr Simon Walsh, an emergency care doctor in London, told BBC Breakfast all London hospitals had ""effectively been working in major incident mode for the last couple of weeks"". ""Most hospitals have expanded their intensive care capacity to somewhere in the region of three times their normal capacity. Obviously we don't have three times the number of staff so our staff are being spread more thinly,"" he said. Hospitals in other parts of the UK are also under pressure. In Wales, senior A&E nurse Sarah Fogarasy saidshe felt ""overwhelming fear"" as 13 ambulances queued at Royal Glamorgan Hospital last Saturday, with no capacity at the unit. And Dr Justin Varney, director of public health in Birmingham, said he was ""very worried"" about the situation in the city, where hospital bosses have warned they don't have enough intensive care nurses to deal with the growing case load. He warned the NHS had still not seen the impact of the rise in cases following the relaxation of restrictions over Christmas ""so it is going to get a lot, lot worse unless we really get this under control"".

"Company offers GP staff Â£5,000 for unused vaccinesThe property investment firm is accused of trying to ""jump the queue"".England","The company offered to pay surgeries a Â£5,000 charitable donation ""or to the staff member directly"" in emails A property investment company has offered GP surgeries Â£5,000 for unused coronavirus vaccine doses. The Hacking Trust's medical division approached surgeries in Bristol and Worthing offering to pay the money to charity ""or the staff member directly"". Robyn Clark, from the Institute of General Practice Management, said it was ""just appalling"". The company, based in London, has apologised, saying its ""good intentions"" were ""misinterpreted"". NHS England said people ""will rightly take a dim view of anyone who tries to jump the queue"". ""The NHS is free at the point of access for everyone who needs it,"" said Mrs Clark. ""What we felt this company was trying to do was jump the queue."" The Bristol-based manager said she worried it could ""create more health inequality"". She said: ""The JCVI [Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation] is trying to prioritise the vaccine based on the vulnerability to Covid."" The e-mail sent to the GP surgery in Worthing said The Hacking Trust was aware that ""many appointments"" for vaccinations are not kept, and that it would be interested in being informed of ""any no-shows"". A donation of Â£5,000 would be paid to a staff member or given to charity for each dose it could secure, the e-mail said. In a statement, the Battersea-based company said it ""offered charitable donations to staff or surgeries in this difficult time for any vaccines which were unused"". It added: ""We had heard that some vaccines were being unused due to missed appointments. We would apologise that our good intentions have been misinterpreted."" NHS England said it knew ""these particular emails were received across the country"". Dr Nikki Kanani, GP and NHS medical director for primary care, said hundreds of NHS teams across the country were ""working hard to deliver vaccines quickly to those who would benefit most"".

Google suspends 'free speech' app ParlerApple will also remove the social network from its App Store if it does not change its policies.,"Google has suspended ""free speech"" social network Parler from its Play Store over its failure to remove ""egregious content"". Parler styles itself as ""unbiased"" social media and has proved popular with people banned from Twitter. But Google said the app had failed to remove posts inciting violence. Apple has also warned Parler it will remove the app from its App Store if it does not comply with its content-moderation requirements. On Parler, the app's chief executive John Matze said: ""We won't cave to politically motivated companies and those authoritarians who hate free speech!"" Launched in 2018, Parler has proved particularly popular among supporters of US President Donald Trump and right-wing conservatives. Such groups have frequently accused Twitter and Facebook of unfairly censoring their views. While Mr Trump himself is not a user, the platform already features several high-profile contributors following earlier bursts of growth in 2020. Texas Senator Ted Cruz boasts 4.9 million followers on the platform, while Fox News host Sean Hannity has about seven million. It briefly became the most-downloaded app in the United States after the US election, following a clampdown on the spread of election misinformation by Twitter and Facebook. However, both Apple and Google have said the app fails to comply with content-moderation requirements. By Shayan Sardarizadeh, BBC Monitoring For months, Parler has been one of the most popular social media platforms for right-wing users. As major platforms began taking action against viral conspiracy theories, disinformation and the harassment of election workers and officials in the aftermath of the US presidential vote, the app became more popular with elements of the fringe far-right. This turned the network into a right-wing echo chamber, almost entirely populated by users fixated on revealing examples of election fraud and posting messages in support of attempts to overturn the election outcome. In the days preceding the Capitol riots, the tone of discussion on the app became significantly more violent, with some users openly discussing ways to stop the certification of Joe Biden's victory by Congress. Unsubstantiated allegations and defamatory claims against a number of senior US figures such as Chief Justice John Roberts and Vice-President Mike Pence were rife on the app. Google and Apple say they are taking necessary action to ensure violent rhetoric is not promoted on their platforms. However, to those increasingly concerned about freedom of speech and expression on online platforms, it represents another example of draconian action by major tech companies which threatens internet freedom. This is a debate which is certain to continue beyond the Trump presidency. In a statement, Google confirmed it had suspended Parler from its Play Store, saying: ""Our longstanding policies require that apps displaying user-generated content have moderation policies and enforcement that removes egregious content like posts that incite violence. ""In light of this ongoing and urgent public safety threat, we are suspending the app's listings from the Play Store until it addresses these issues."" Apple has warned Parler it will be removed from the App Store on Saturday,externalin a letter published by Buzzfeed News. It said it had seen ""accusations that the Parler app was used to plan, coordinate, and facilitate"" the attacks on the US Capitol on 6 January. Mr Matze said Parler had ""no way to organise anything"" and pointed out that Facebook groups and events had been used to organise action. But Apple said: ""Our investigation has found that Parler is not effectively moderating and removing content that encourages illegal activity and poses a serious risk to the health and safety of users in direct violation of your own terms of service."" ""We won't distribute apps that present dangerous and harmful content."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a related development, Google has kicked Steve Bannon's War Room podcast off YouTube, saying it had repeatedly violated the platform's rules. The ex-White House aide's channel had more than 300,000 subscribers. Steve Bannon served as President Trump's chief strategist for eight months in 2017 ""In accordance with our strikes system, we have terminated Steve Bannon's channel 'War room' and one associated channel for repeatedly violating our Community Guidelines,"" Google said in a statement. ""Any channel posting new videos with misleading content that alleges widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of the 2020 US Presidential election in violation of our policies will receive a strike, a penalty which temporarily restricts uploading or live-streaming. Channels that receive three strikes in the same 90-day period will be permanently removed from YouTube."" The action was taken shortly after the channel posted an interview with Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, in which he blamed the Democrats for the rioting on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. One anti-misinformation group said the action was long overdue after ""months of Steve Bannon calling for revolution and violence"". ""The truth is YouTube should have taken down Steve Bannon's account a long time ago and they shouldn't rely on the labour of extremism researchers to moderate the content on their platform,"" said Madeline Peltz, Senior Researcher at Media Matters for America.

"Schools shut to half term unless Covid cases fallLockdown measures across Wales will also be extended and strengthened, the first minister says.","This video can not be played Education minister Kirsty Williams says online learning must continue for now Schools and colleges in Wales will stay closed to most pupils until the February half term unless there is a ""significant"" fall in Covid cases. First Minister Mark Drakeford also confirmedcurrent lockdown restrictionswould be extended and ""strengthened"". This means non-essential retail, hospitality venues, licensed premises and leisure facilities remain closed and showrooms must now shut as well. Mr Drakeford said: ""The pandemic has reached a significant point."" He told BBC Radio Wales the announcement was the ""best certainty"" he could offer parents, pupils and teachers, ""in a world which is highly uncertain and where things change almost every single day"". The phased return to face-to-face learning at some Welsh universities has also been postponed, while internal GCSE, A-level and AS-level assessments have been cancelled. The announcement follows a similar move in England, where Prime Minister Boris Johnson has already saidschools would not open before half term. Spring half term in Wales is scheduled to take place the week beginning Monday 15 February. Wales has been in analert level four lockdown since 20 Decemberin an attempt to reduce the transmission of coronavirus. On Thursday,63 further deaths from coronaviruswere reported by Public Health Wales. What are Wales' lockdown rules? What is the latest Covid advice for children? School closures 'throwing children under the bus' Speaking to BBC Radio Wales, Mr Drakeford said the new variant was more easily spread and stricter lockdown measures were now needed to keep people safe. Ministers are in talks with employers and unions and changes are set to be announced for workplaces - to protect workers - early next week. Mr Drakeford said he wanted to see the way supermarkets were policed return to the way they were during the first lockdown,with strict number limits in stores and social distancing measures abided to. But he said a curfew, meaning people would have to be in their homes by a certain time,similar to that seen in Northern Ireland, was not currently being considered. This video can not be played Parents and teachers say they want to know when schools will reopen in Wales Schools and colleges had already been told they would have toteach online until 18 January at the earliest, however this will now continue if cases of the virus do not fall ""materially"" before the next review date on 29 January. If cases do not drop, that would mean schools would reopen on 22 February at the earliest, and internal exams have also been cancelled. But teaching unions have warned that moreuniformed lateral flow testing needs to be in placeand teachers must be vaccinated before talks on how to reopen schools can begin. Speaking at the Welsh Government coronavirus briefing, Mr Drakeford said people working at special schools and school and college staff who were at risk would soon be vaccinated. Cardiff University has also confirmed that a phased return to in-person teaching has been cancelled, with learning continuing online for most students until 22 February. Students currently have to have hadtwo lateral flow tests confirming they are negative for Covid-19 before they return to Welsh campuses- and face to face teaching is only resuming for medical students and those who have practical parts of their courses on campus. Mr Drakeford said: ""Universities have worked hard to make sure that when students do return it is done in a careful and controlled way, with the safety of those young people and their communities at the forefront of their planning."" The announcement affecting showrooms means any retailers which allow people to browse and then order for a future date - such as kitchens, bathrooms, furniture and car sales - must close. Click and collect will still be allowed. Confirmingalert level four,externalrestrictions would continue for at least three more weeks, Mr Drakeford told Radio Wales the lockdown measures were already leading to cases falling, but the rate remained high. ""There are some positive signs that the huge collective effort we are making is making a difference, but the numbers are stubbornly high,"" he said. ""We have not yet seen an impact of those falls feeding into the number of people being admitted to hospital and becoming, sometimes, so ill they need intensive care. ""We need to see the numbers come down as well so that our NHS is genuinely able to cope with the enormous pressure it is currently facing."" Mr Drakeford said huge efforts were being made to rollout the Covid-19 vaccines, and with the ""end being in sight"" it was more important than ever for people to follow the rules and stay home. ""We have made so many sacrifices together and we mustn't stop now,"" he said. Schools in Wales closed early before the Christmas break and may not reopen until late February Schools and colleges are open for children of critical workers, as well as vulnerable learners and anyone who needs to complete essential exams or assessments All nurseries and childcare settings remain open Universities in Wales had already agreed a staggered start to term, but these are now being pushed back with learning continuing online Welsh university students studying in England should not return to campuses and will be taught online after a separatelockdownwas imposed Education Minister Kirsty Williams said: ""Schools and colleges have been safe and secure environments throughout the pandemic and that continues to be the case. ""However, the latestTAC,externalreport is clear on education's contribution. We know that school and college settings can contribute to wider social mixing outside the education environment and, right now, we all have to play our part in supressing this virus."" Ms Williams said the government would use the period until the next review date to ""look at all the possibilities for a phased and safe return of some pupils, such as those studying for qualifications, or the youngest children who find distance learning the most difficult"". Following the announcement, exams regulator Qualifications Wales cancelled the spring ""internal assessment window"" for GCSE, AS and A-level pupils, which was scheduled for 22 February - 23 April. This was introduced following the decision that exams would be cancelledin 2021. Chief executive Philip Blaker said: ""We know that learners need clarity about how they will be assessed and there will be clarity on revised arrangements soon."" Mr Drakeford said discussions were under way between teachers and education officials over ways children could catch up after missing time in school. This video can not be played This map shows the pattern of death rates involving Covid-19 by week since the pandemic began Speaking at Friday's Welsh Government coronavirus briefing, Mr Drakeford said police and local authorities would continue to crack down on people who break lockdown rules. Since the start of the pandemic, 3,585 fines have been handed out by police forces in Wales. ""Of course I want to thank everyone for following the rules and helping to keep Wales safe. It's always frustrating when a small minority act as though those rules do not apply to them,"" he added. ""I want everybody to know that where people knowingly and persistently break the rules, action will be taken. Too many lives have been lost to this awful virus to allow anybody to believe that they do not share in the responsibility that binds us all."" Unions welcomed the news saying the health and safety of pupils and staff ""had to be a priority"", but said teachers must now be given the vaccine as a priority, and pupils and staff must be protected before talks about reopening schools began. Currently teachers are not on the priority list for immunisation, and have to wait to get the jab dependent on their age and if they have a medical condition. When will I get the vaccine and what does it mean? Laura Doel, director of The National Association of Headteachers Cymru, said a ""properly organised"" testing regime needed to be put in place for schools, and special schools and pupil referral units needed support to remain open. ""Any plan that sees school staff return to face-to-face learning should be afforded as much protection as possible against the virus,"" she said.""Once these issues have been addressed, then we can discuss the orderly return to school we all want."" Meanwhile, Eithne Hughes, director of the Association of School and College Leaders Cymru said: ""I think we would be happier if we had clarity about what that date looks like, it would give confidence in the system."" Opposition parties called for clear plans on how schools would return and for support to make sure pupils from poorer backgrounds did not fall behind due to a ""digital divide"". Plaid Cymru's education spokeswoman Sian Gwenllian said: ""The Welsh Government must plan now for the gradual and safe reopening of schools, putting in place safety measures, and should lay out plans for a vaccination programme for schools staff."" Welsh Conservative education spokeswoman Suzy Davies called for the Welsh Government to publish evidence on its reasons for closing schools, bring forward vaccines for teachers, and that money must be made available for all pupils to access laptops for online learning. ""This is another bleak day for education in Wales,"" she said. ""Decisions aren't easy to make and I urge everyone involved in the journeys to and from school to consider how they might help schools open again and stay open.""

Q&A: What is the latest Covid advice for children?,"Schools are closed until at least 18 January Schools in Wales are closed until at least 18 January after the Welsh Government reversed an earlier decision to let schools start opening from Wednesday. It came after unions threatened legal action over concerns about the new coronavirus variant. Wales went into a nationwide stay-at-home level 4 lockdown the weekend before Christmas, with First Minister Mark Drakefordrecently warning it was likely to continueuntil the end of January at least. So what is the latest advice for children in Wales? No. The advice from the Welsh Government is clear. Mixing is not permitted between households (unless in a support bubble) and no indoor or outdoor gatherings are allowed. No children's activities like Scouts or dance classes are permitted to meet. Here's the rule on outdoor playfrom the Welsh Government,external: ""Children can play outside with members of their own household or support bubble but should not arrange to meet with children from other households. This applies to under-11s as well as to over-11s. ""Where children are old enough to understand the rules, they should be encouraged to follow them and to avoid mixing with other children outside their household or support bubble."" The new variant is spreading in all age groups The new variant of Covid is ""hugely more transmissible"" according to an Imperial College study, raising thereproduction (R) numberof the virus by between 0.4 and 0.7. The Welsh Government's Technical Advisory Committee (TAC) saidin a report,externalon 23 December the role of children in transmitting the variant was being investigated. Early results from the Imperial study had indicated that the virus was spreading more quickly among under-20s, particularly among secondary school age children. But the very latest data indicates that it was spreading quickly across all age groups, according to Prof Axel Gandy who was a member of the research team. ""One possible explanation is that the early data was collected during the time of the November lockdown [in England] where schools were open and the activities of the adult population were more restricted. We are seeing now that the new virus has increased infectiousness across all age groups,"" he said. So while children might transmit the virus more easily than the previous version of the virus, so will everyone else. But the evidence is that there islimited spread of the virus in primary age children, with teenagers more likely to transmit it, although not any more so than adults. In numbers, since September 4,128cases among pupils 3,176cases in staff 1,573schools with at least one case 474cases in the most recent six days 11schools have had more than 20 cases Meanwhile, the most recent analysis by Public Health Wales has found 71.6 % of schools have had a Covid-19 case. Of 3,157 school cases reported in the three weeks before Christmas, 832 were in schools in Cwm Taf Morgannwg and 702 were in Aneurin Bevan health board area. Children under 11 do not have to social distance within their school bubbles - but schools are closed The Welsh Government advice thatchildren under the age of 11,externaldo not have to socially distance is still in force. However, as level 4 restrictions are in now in place, they clearly state that no-one, including children, should be meeting up either indoor or outdoors with other people, as stated above. Schools are currently closed and therefore class or year group bubbles, where social distancing does not apply, are not meeting. These bubbles are not allowed to meet outside of school. In effect this means children should be socially distancing from anyone not in their household or support bubble. Childcare settings such as (non-school) nurseries, creches and child minders remain open. People are still allowed to use relatives or friends for childcare but only ""when no other options are available"". The Welsh Government advice adds: ""Children should not be cared for outside of their home if they are ill, or by anyone who is ill. ""Adults dropping off children for childcare should not enter someone else's home."" As stated above, the rules allow relatives to provide childcare but only as a last resort. Otherwise households are not allowed to mix, indoors or outdoors, unless you are in a support bubble with them. The two scenarios for support bubbles with a grandparent would be if a grandparent lives alone, or if a single-parent household needed support from grandparents. Families would have to make up their own minds in those scenarios whether the children could pose a risk to their grandparents' health and make decisions accordingly. Closing schools a last resort, says government Schools' phased return defended by first minister Unions threaten action over Wales school return 'Flexible' school return plan in Wales from Monday Impact of new variant on children investigated No rise in severe Covid child cases, say doctors At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Stricter Covid supermarket rules consideredThe Welsh Government is in discussions with supermarkets about bringing ""more visible"" regulations.Wales","The Welsh Government is in discussions about bringing in ""more visible"" coronavirus regulations. Stricter enforcement of coronavirus rules could return to supermarkets in Wales, Mark Drakeford has said. The first minister said he had heard concerns from people ""expressing anxiety"" about a lack of ""visible protections"" in supermarkets. The Welsh Government is now in talks with stores about social-distancing measures. Mr Drakeford said he wanted to see stores policed as they were during the first lockdown. Among the measures previously used was a strict limit of the numbers of people allowed in a store however Mr Drakeford said people were worried the rules ""don't appear to be there this time"". ""Given the fact the new variant is so much easier to catch... we are looking at supermarkets and other places where people leave their homes, to make sure they are organised in a way that keeps their staff and customers safe,"" he said. Supermarket websites struggle amid new lockdown Meat factories warn Covid absences could hit supplies Supermarkets try to calm food shortage fears amid border chaos He said previously sanitising arrangements had been ""very visible"", one-way markings were prominently displayed, regular reminders were announced to customers and staff were also posted at the front entrance of supermarkets ""That person was carefully controlling the numbers of people going in, to make sure that they were no more than a certain number of people in the store at any one time,"" he said. ""There was somebody directing people to the checkout, to make sure people weren't queuing next to each other over prolonged periods, and markings on the floor so people kept at a two-metre distance"". However the first minister said some of those measures are no longer as apparent to people. ""I want to make sure that those visible signs of the protections that are being offered to the public and the shop workers are in place again."" Federation of Small Businesses Wales said has called for clarity on what support would be available and the possible new measures required of shops. Policy Chair, Ben Francis, said: ""We've already asked to see more information on the technical data that informs the decisions that Welsh Government are making. ""It seems clear that businesses will require funding support for longer than was originally anticipated if they are to survive this troubling period. ""Welsh Government should urgently give clarity on what additional funding will be made available to support businesses beyond this next three week period to allow them to plan.""

"Twitter permanently suspends Trump's accountThe social media giant bans the US president ""due to the risk of further incitement of violence"".US & CanadaAre Covid patients getting younger?What does the data show about the age groups being affected by the virus in the second wave?Health","Donald Trump posted a video on Twitter following his earlier suspension US President Donald Trump's Twitter account is ""permanently suspended... due to the risk of further incitement of violence"", the company says. Twitter saidthe decision was made ""after close review of recent Tweets from the @realDonaldTrump account"",external. It comes amid a Big Tech purge of the online platforms used by Mr Trump and his supporters. Some lawmakers and celebrities have been calling for years on Twitter to ban Mr Trump.Â Former First Lady Michelle Obama tweeted on Thursday that the Silicon Valley giants should stop enabling Mr Trump's ""monstrous behaviour"" and permanently expel him. Mr Trump was locked out of his account for 12 hours on Wednesday after he called the people who stormed the US Capitol ""patriots"". Hundreds of his supporters entered the complex as the US Congress attempted to certify Joe Biden's victory in the presidential election. The ensuing violence led to the deaths of four civilians and a police officer. Twitter warned then that it would ban Mr Trump ""permanently"" if he breached the platform's rules again. This video can not be played Voices from Trump land: 'We will continue to be divided' After being allowed back on Twitter, Mr Trump posted two tweets on Friday that the company cited as the final straws. In one, he wrote: ""The 75,000,000 great American Patriots who voted for me, AMERICA FIRST, and MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN, will have a GIANT VOICE long into the future. They will not be disrespected or treated unfairly in any way, shape or form!!!"" Twitter said this tweet ""is being interpreted as further indication that President Trump does not plan to facilitate an 'orderly transition'"". In the next, the president tweeted: ""To all of those who have asked, I will not be going to the Inauguration on January 20th."" Twitter said this was ""being received by a number of his supporters as further confirmation that the election was not legitimate"". Twitter said both of these tweets were ""in violation of the Glorification of Violence Policy"". Americans 'shocked' and 'disgusted' by riots Questions mount over security failure A visual guide to the Congress riots Democrats plan impeachment After Twitter had banned his @realDonaldTrump account, Mr Trump tweeted from the US president's official @Potus account suggesting he would ""look at the possibilities of building out our own platform in the future"" and railing against Twitter. But the tweets were removed from the platform as soon as they were posted. Reacting to the ban, Trump 2020 campaign adviser Jason Miller tweeted: ""Disgusting... if you don't think they're coming for you next, you're wrong."" Earlier on Friday, Twitter permanently banned the accounts of two Trump loyalists: former national security adviser Michael Flynn and attorney Sidney Powell. Meanwhile, conservative radio host Rush Limbaugh deactivated his Twitter account shortly after they were banned. Later in the day, Google suspended Parler - a self-styled ""free speech"" rival to Twitter that is increasingly popular with Trump supporters - from its online store. Google suspends 'free speech' app Parler ""We're aware of continued posting in the Parler app that seeks to incite ongoing violence in the US,"" said Google. On Thursday, Facebook said it had suspended Mr Trump ""indefinitely"". The popular gaming platform Twitch also placed an indefinite ban on the outgoing president's channel, which he has used for rally broadcasts. So has Snapchat. Two online Trump memorabilia stores were closed this week by e-commerce company Shopify. On Friday, Reddit banned its ""donaldtrump"" forum for the president's supporters. Mr Trump used Twitter to insult adversaries, cheer allies, fire officials, deny ""fake news"" and vent grievances, often using all capital letters and exclamation marks to underline his point. This video can not be played Capitol riots: âWe would have been murderedâ Though critics said the posts were a torrent of misinformation, the medium helped him get around media filters and instantly connect with nearly 89 million followers. His tweets were also known for the occasional spelling error, and he sometimes left followers guessing with apparent mis-types, such as when he posted, ""Despite the constant negative press covfefe"". The Department of Justice said in 2017 that Mr Trump's tweets were ""official statements of the President of the United States"". Donald Trump loves being on Twitter, it's his primary way of getting his message out. He likes the short format, he likes his ability to reach tens of millions of people at the click of a button - bypassing the media. The fact that Twitter's decision was made 48 hours after the rioting at the Capitol on Wednesday shows that this was not an easy move for the social media giant. The platform has benefited hugely from Mr Trump's participation, it has been the place to go to hear the latest from the most powerful man in the world. But Twitter has acted for a number of reasons. It says it's because of the likelihood of him inciting violence in the future. But it's also because his power is very quickly slipping away. He is now being treated like an ordinary member of the public. And as mere mortal, repeatedly spreading disinformation, fake news and inciting violence will get you thrown off mainstream social media platforms. For those who say this violates free speech enshrined in the First Amendment of the US Constitution? Big Tech's argument is that they are private companies, not state actors. So, they are free to moderate their platforms as they see fit. The big question now is, can Trumpism survive without the backing of mainstream media? Or will it simply slip into the shadows of the internet? Read more from James Twitterwrote in a blog post on Friday,external: ""In the context of horrific events this week, we made it clear on Wednesday that additional violations of the Twitter Rules would potentially result in this very course of action. ""Our public interest framework exists to enable the public to hear from elected officials and world leaders directly. It is built on a principle that the people have a right to hold power to account in the open."" It added: ""However, we made it clear going back years that these accounts are not above our rules and cannot use Twitter to incite violence. We will continue to be transparent around our policies and their enforcement."" Some 350 Twitter employees had signed a letter this week to the company chief executive, Jack Dorsey, asking him to ban the president in the wake of the Capitol riot. The letter said: ""Despite our efforts to serve the public conversation, as Trump's megaphone, we helped fuel the deadly events of January 6th."" Twitter first took action against Mr TrumpÂ in May 2020 appending fact-checks to tweets he sent claiming postal votes were fraudulent. Later that same week it posted a warning label when the president threatened to send in the military to quell Black Lives Matter protests as he added, ""when the looting starts, the shooting starts"". Twitter used these fact-checks and warning labels increasingly throughout the year for Trump tweets about coronavirus and the presidential election, culminating in Friday's ban.

Nurse's 'overwhelming fear' as 13 ambulances queue,"This video can not be played Senior doctor Amanda Farrow said the hospital faced ""unrelenting"" pressure A nurse felt ""overwhelming fear"" as 13 ambulances queued at her hospital's A&E department - in the Welsh region currently hardest hit by Covid deaths. To date Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board, which runs Royal Glamorgan Hospital, has reported 1,091 deaths of patients with coronavirus. BBC Wales was granted access to A&E at the hospital in Rhondda Cynon Taf. Senior doctor Amanda Farrow said the whole hospital had faced ""unrelenting"" pressure last Saturday. Sarah Fogarasy was the senior nurse on duty as 13 ambulances queued up outside her A&E department Senior A&E nurse Sarah Fogarasy, who was on shift as the ambulances arrived, said there was no capacity at the unit - a situation that left her wanting ""to leave"". ""We had to escalate it to our site manager and deputy head of nursing who were liaising with the executive team on call,"" she said. ""And then it got to 13 patients outside - I had no capacity in this unit, no resuscitation capacity, no capacity to put a patient on CPAP [continuous positive airway pressure] should they require that and no physical areas to put a patient in. ""It was overwhelming."" On Saturday, 13 ambulances queued outside the hospital's A&E department She said she found it hard to keep going. ""This bit makes me quite emotionalâ¦ for the first time I was sat trying to coordinate this department and I had that overwhelming fear that I just wanted to leave,"" Ms Fogarasy continued. ""I was just - 'I'm done. I'm done with this'... and it's scary, it fills you full of fear when you have got 13 ambulances outside, queuing around the carpark. Where do you go from that?"" She said it was the team that kept her going: ""I started looking around to all the staff working tirelessly and just trying to remember what we're here for and why I became a nurse. ""I know it sounds soppy but it's literally the humanitarian effort that has gone into [fighting] this pandemic that has kept people going. ""It's the sheer determination and guts of the staff working in these times that is so powerful, that keeps the shift going."" Emergency Medicine Consultant Amanda Farrow said it was a ""very emotional time for everyone"" Dr Farrow, emergency medicine consultant, said staffing and bed numbers were of particular concern. ""In the emergency department the challenge we have is with regards to flow, so that is our daily challenge,"" she explained. ""And we say it's like playing a game of Tetris trying to work out which patient you can put where."" Staff reported feeling overwhelmed as they work through the second Covid wave She said the second wave of the virus had also seen more staff off sick with Covid and isolating - with some becoming very ill. ""We've had staff in as patients and one of my colleagues - I saw them when they were critically ill and ended up going to intensive care,"" continued Dr Farrow. ""So it's very emotional time for everyone as well you know, looking after the sick patients and looking after your colleagues. ""There's a level of anxiety still around -  will you be the next person to get this disease?"" She said although fewer people were attending A&E, they were seeing more people arriving by ambulance and presenting with more complex needs. ""The group of patients we are seeing this time I think is different, we're definitely having more younger people with Covid that are becoming sick, the volume is very high in the community. ""I think people are afraid of come into the hospital as well, so there are still quite a lot of patients who leave it maybe a bit too late before they're seeking hospital attention."" Speaking from her intensive care bed, Helen Whatmore said she was extremely grateful to staff Helen Whatmore, 45, from Beddau, has been hospital since early December after developing Covid symptoms. Speaking from her intensive care bed, she said she had been unwell in February so assumed she had already caught the virus. ""I honestly didn't believe it was as bad until I caught [Covid] this time,"" she said. ""This time it's absolutely knocked the socks off me. It's nearly killed me. ""A friend of mine passed away as I came into hospital and I came down very rapidly with Covid, kidney problems and pneumonia."" She said she was grateful for the care she had received: ""The nurses are coming in [working] all shifts, they're fighting for your loved ones, from the time they enter right until the time they leave, then they're changing over and doing the same again. ""People are passing awayâ¦ how much more have they got to do? We're asking them to protect our children and our families. Why are we not protecting them ourselves? Saving our families and our own children."" At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

"Kim vows to expand North Korea's nuclear arsenalKim Jong-un calls the US his ""biggest enemy"" and says plans for a nuclear submarine are nearly complete.Asia","North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said US policy towards his country would ""never change"" North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has said the US is his country's ""biggest enemy"" and that he does not expect Washington to change its policy toward Pyongyang - whoever is president.

What is the UK's R number?,"The rate at which coronavirus infection is falling in the UK - as measured by the R number - has continued to level off. The latest R estimate from the government's scientific advisory group Sage,is between 0.7 and 0.9,external, up slightly from the week before. It means that, on average, every 10 people with Covid will infect between seven and nine other people. The R number is a way of rating coronavirus or any disease's ability to spread. R is the number of people that one infected person will pass on a virus to, on average. Measles has an R number of 15 in populations without immunity. That means, on average, one person will spread measles to 15 others. Coronavirus - known officially as Sars-CoV-2 - would have a reproduction number of about three if no action was taken to stop it spreading. You can't capture the moment people are infected. Instead, scientists work backwards. Data - such as the number of people dying, admitted to hospital or testing positive for the virus over time - is used to estimate how easily the virus is spreading. If the R value is higher than one, then the number of cases keeps increasing. But if the R number is lower the disease will eventually stop spreading, because not enough new people are being infected to sustain the outbreak. If the R-value is above one then the number of cumulative cases takes off, but if it is below one then eventually the outbreak stops. The further below one, the faster that happens. Governments everywhere want to force the R number down from about three (the R number if we took no action) to below one. The R number is not fixed. Instead, it changes as our behaviour changes or as immunity develops. Mathematical modellers at Imperial College London attempted to track how the number changed as isolation, social distancing and the full lockdown were introduced in spring of 2020. Before any measures came in, the R number was well above one and the conditions were ripe for a large outbreak. Successive restrictions brought it down, but it was not until full lockdown that it was driven below one. Although the R number across the UK is now between 0.7 and 0.9, there are regional differences. Scotland'sestimated R number isbetween 0.8 and 1.0,external, up slightly on the previous week. InWalesthe number isbetween 0.6 and 0.9,external- while inNorthern Irelandit remains between 0.75 and 0.95. InEngland, the number is risen slightly to between 0.8 and 1.0. What are the latest social distancing rules? How many confirmed cases are there in your area? Vaccine passports could discriminate, experts warn TheR numberis one of the big three. Another isseverity- some people have a very mild disease that does not cause many problems. But coronavirus and the disease it causes, Covid-19, can be severe and deadly. The last is thenumber of cases, which is important for deciding when to act. If you have a high number, but ease restrictions so the reproduction number is about one, then you will continue to have a high number of cases. A vaccination programme, like the onecurrently under way in the UK, is another way to bring down the reproduction number. A coronavirus patient would naturally infect three others on average, but if a vaccine could protect two of them from infection, then the reproduction number would fall from three to one.

"Breaking|Breaking newsIndonesia passenger plane missing after take-offA Boeing 737 goes missing after take-off in Indonesia, believed to be carrying more than 50 passengers.Asia","Relatives of those on board are waiting anxiously for news A Boeing 737 passenger plane carrying 62 people is believed to have crashed into the sea shortly after take-off from Indonesia's capital Jakarta. The Sriwijaya Air disappeared from radars four minutes into its journey to Pontianak in West Kalimantan province. It is thought to have dropped more than 3,000m (10,000ft) in less than a minute, according to flight tracking website Flightradar24.com. Witnesses said they had seen and heard at least one explosion. Fisherman Solihin, who goes by one name, told the BBC Indonesian service he had witnessed a crash and his captain decided to return to land. ""The plane fell like lightning into the sea and exploded in the water,"" he said. ""It was pretty close to us, the shards of a kind of plywood almost hit my ship."" A timeline of global air disasters Plane crash fatalities fell more than 50% in 2019 Mechanical v human: Why do planes crash? A number of residents of an island near where the plane disappeared told the BBC they had found objects they thought were from the plane. Police officers and fishermen show debris that they believe came from the plane Search and rescue efforts were suspended overnight but were due to resume on Sunday. The Indonesian navy was reportedly deployed to look for the aircraft on Saturday. Navy official Abdul Rasyid told Reuters news agency it had determined the plane's coordinates and ships had been deployed to the location. The aircraft is not a 737 Max, the Boeing model that was grounded from March 2019 until last December following two deadly crashes. Last contact with the plane, with the call sign SJY182, was made at 14:40 local time (07:40 GMT), according to the transport ministry. The usual flight time to Pontianak, in the west of the island of Borneo, is 90 minutes. It did not send a distress signal, according to the head of national search and rescue agency Air Marshal Bagus Puruhito. There were thought to be 50 passengers - including seven children and three babies - and 12 crew on board, though the plane has a capacity of 130. Everyone on board was Indonesian, officials say. Relatives of the passengers have been waiting anxiously at the airport in Pontianak, as well as at Jakarta's Soekarno-Hatta International Airport. ""I have four family members on the flight - my wife and my three children,"" Yaman Zai told reporters through tears. ""[My wife] sent me a picture of the baby today... How could my heart not be torn into pieces?"" According to registration details, the plane is a 26-year-old Boeing 737-500. It was in good condition, Sriwijaya Air chief executive Jefferson Irwin Jauwena told reporters. Take-off had been delayed for 30 minutes due to heavy rain, he said. Sriwijaya Air, founded in 2003, is a local budget airline which flies to Indonesian and other South-East Asian destinations. The Sriwijaya Air plane disappeared from radar screens shortly after take-off (file photo) The plane went missing about 20km (12 miles) north of the capital Jakarta, not far from where another flight crashed in October 2018. A total of 189 died when an Indonesian Lion Air flight plunged into the sea about 12 minutes after take-off from the city. Boeing 737 Max returns to skies after safety fears Series of failures behind Boeing Lion Air crash Boeing to pay $2.5bn over 737 Max conspiracy That disaster was blamed on a series of failures in the plane's design, but also faults by the airline and the pilots. It was one of two crashes that led regulators to pull the Boeing 737 Max from service. The model resumed passenger flights in December after a systems overhaul. The BBC's Jerome Wirawan in Jakarta says the latest events will bring up difficult questions and emotions in Indonesia, whose airline industry has faced intense scrutiny since the Lion Air crash. The aircraft which appears to have been lost off Indonesia was a Boeing 737, but it should not be confused with the much more modern 737 Max - which was grounded following two tragic accidents in 2018 and 2019, including one off the coast of Indonesia. The Sriwijaya Air flight appears to have been carried out by a Boeing 737-500. This plane formed part of the 737 Classic series, the second generation of 737, which was built during the 1980s and 1990s. The plane, seen as a workhorse aircraft for many years, has a strong safety record. The Sriwijaya Air 737 was 26 years old. While airlines do tend to prefer to fly newer aircraft - because they have lower running costs - it is not uncommon to find planes of this age still in service. Indonesia, though, has a relatively poor record on aviation safety. For more than a decade carriers from the region were banned from flying into the EU. Until recently, the perception had been that standards were improving, and in 2018 all Indonesian airlines were removed from the EU's blacklist. That, however, was before the loss of a Lion Air 737 Max in October 2018. Although the design of the aircraft is widely believed to have been the main cause of the accident, investigators also highlighted issues such as poor maintenance procedures and inadequate flying skills as contributory factors.

"'Act like you've got the virus', government urges","People in England are being told to act like they have got Covid as part of a government advertising campaign aimed at tackling the rise in infections. Boris Johnson said the public should ""stay at home"" and not get complacent. On Friday1,325 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test were recorded in the UK- the highest daily figure yet - along with 68,053 new cases. Government sources say there is likely to be more focus from police on enforcing rather than explaining rules. ""With over 1,000 people dying yesterday it's more important than ever everyone sticks to rules,"" a source told the BBC. As cases and deaths soar, the government is releasing its advertising campaign, which will be shared across television, radio, newspapers and on social media. England's chief medical officer, Prof Chris Whitty, says in the advert: ""Vaccines give clear hope for the future, but for now we must all stay home, protect the NHS and save lives.""

Prime Minister Boris Johnson says hospitals are ""under more pressure than at any other time since the start of the pandemic"", with infection rates increasing at an ""alarming rate"" across the country and the NHS under ""severe strain"". It comes after London's mayor Sadiq Khan said the spread of coronavirus was ""out of control"" as he declared a ""major incident"" in the capital on Friday. Such an incident is an emergency that requires the implementation of special arrangements by one or all of the emergency services, the NHS or the local authority. It means the emergency services and hospitals cannot guarantee their normal level of response. What can police do to enforce lockdown rules? Postcode check: Find out the rules where you live Hospital staff 'cannot go on like this' While the government seeks to reinforce its ""stay at home"" message, some police forces have faced criticism for their approaches to tackling potential breaches of coronavirus restrictions. Derbyshire Police has said it will review fixed penalties issued during the new national lockdown after two women were ordered to pay Â£200 eachafter driving five miles from their home for a walk on Wednesday. Susan Michie, a professor of health psychology at University College London, said ""more support and enablement"" was needed for people to adhere to the regulations, for example support to help people self-isolate, rather than punishment. Prof Michie, who sits on a subcommittee of the government's Scientific Advisory Group for Emergencies, also said the current restrictions were ""too lax"". ""When you look at the data, it shows that almost 90% of people are overwhelmingly adhering to the rules despite the fact that we're also seeing more people out and about,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. However, she said in comparison to the first lockdown last spring the restrictions were less strict, with more people allowed to go out to work and children's nurseries open, meaning public transport is busier. The number of people travelling by public transport in London has decreased since the latest national lockdown began, with tube journeys now at 18% pre-pandemic demand and bus journeys at 30%, according to figures from Transport for London. However, during the first lockdown passenger numbers fell below 10% at some points. Prof Michie added that the winter season posed extra challenges because the virus survives longer in the cold and people spend more time indoors, where the virus can spread more easily. Combined with the more transmissible new variant, she said ""we should have a stricter rather than less strict lockdown than we had back in March"". Dr Adam Kucharski, another scientist advising the government and an associate professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that because the new variant was more transmissible ""each interaction we have has become riskier than it was before"". ""So even if we went back to that kind of last spring level of reduction in contacts we couldn't be confident that we would see the same effect that we saw last year because of this increased transmission,"" he said. England, much of Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland continue to be under strict national measures, with stay-at-home orders in place for most people. There is considerable concern in government about the continued spread of the virus. No 10 believes more needs to be done to emphasise how severe the current situation is - which is why we are getting some very stark warnings from the medical experts. Ministers continue to praise the public - but there is also more emphasis on people taking the rules seriously, as was the case last spring when the first lockdown was imposed. The prime minister warns people against complacency, saying: ""Your compliance is now more vital than ever"".

Dr Simon Walsh, an emergency care doctor in London, told BBC Breakfast all London hospitals had ""effectively been working in major incident mode for the last couple of weeks"". ""Most hospitals have expanded their intensive care capacity to somewhere in the region of three times their normal capacity. Obviously we don't have three times the number of staff so our staff are being spread more thinly,"" he said. Hospitals in other parts of the UK are also under pressure. In Wales, senior A&E nurse Sarah Fogarasy saidshe felt ""overwhelming fear"" as 13 ambulances queued at Royal Glamorgan Hospital last Saturday, with no capacity at the unit. And Dr Justin Varney, director of public health in Birmingham, said he was ""very worried"" about the situation in the city, where hospital bosses have warned they don't have enough intensive care nurses to deal with the growing case load. He warned the NHS had still not seen the impact of the rise in cases following the relaxation of restrictions over Christmas ""so it is going to get a lot, lot worse unless we really get this under control"".

Trumpâs Twitter downfall,"The president says he hates Big Tech. Yet he has loved using Twitter. He's used it as a way, for more than 10 years, to bypass the media and speak directly to voters. The 280 characters fits neatly with his style of political engagement - broad brushstrokes rather than details. And Twitter has undoubtedly benefited from President Trump too, the place to go to hear the latest musings from the most powerful person on the planet. That decade-long symbiosis has been ended with a shuddering halt. Immediately after the deadly riots, Twitterlocked the President's Twitter feedand asked Mr Trump to delete three tweets for violationsaround its Civic Integrity policy.,external, which he promptly did. After the suspension he tweeted as a new man, the nonsense claims of mass voter fraud replaced with a more conciliatory tone. Privately though Twitter was pondering whether it had gone far enough. Facebook had already acted, banning Donald Trump ""indefinitely"". After more than 48 hours of consideration, Twitter acted. It made unquestionably the most important moderation decision in its history. It banned the president of the United States. Some have asked why he wasn't kicked off sooner. Mr Trump or one of his associates appears to have deleted some of his most recent tweets Well, Twitter has very specific rules about world leaders. ""We recognise that sometimes it may be in the public interest to allow people to view tweets that would otherwise be taken down,"" Twitter's rules say. ""At present, we limit exceptions to one critical type of public-interest content - tweets from elected and government officials."" Chief executive Jack Dorsey had felt it was in the public interest to keep the account active, albeit with warning messages. ""No one is turning a blind eye,"" a senior source told the BBC before the ban. In short, Mr Trump had been allowed to remain on Twitter - despite numerous breaches of its rules - because he is the president. Trump blocked by Twitter and Facebook US Congress debates election after deadly riot Twitter to wipe Trump's followers before handover With less than two weeks to go of Trump's presidency, many social media companies have now decided enough is enough. Critics say the outgoing president's words on social media, for years, helped to incite Wednesday's storming of Capitol Hill. All the big social media companies have made it clear that - as a private citizen - if you continually look to peddle conspiracy theories and promote extremism, you should expect to be kicked out. With just a few days of his presidency left, Mr Trump is already being held to a different standard - his privileges stripped. What's driving this? To be cynical, social media companies are acutely aware that President-elect Joe Biden believes Big Tech hasn't done enough to quell fake news and hate speech on their platforms. Rioters broke into Congress after a speech by Mr Trump on Wednesday They are now desperate to show that they can, in fact, police their own platforms without the need for stringent legal reforms. What better way to show you're serious than to act on Mr Trump's misinformation? What will Mr Trump do next? Well he's already said he's looking into the possibility of building his own platform in the future. But for now he's consigned to the fringes of the internet. Can Trumpism survive without Big Tech?

Questions mount over Capitol security failure,"At least five deaths have been linked to the violence, which saw dozens of police injured With the country still reeling from Wednesday's violence in Washington, serious questions are being asked about how such a massive security breach was able to happen at the heart of US government. Crowds of pro-Trump supporters were able to force their way inside one of the country's most historically and politically significant buildings while elected lawmakers were inside moving to certify Joe Biden's election victory. The world watched as a mob of rioters seemed to roam free around inside -  looting and vandalising symbols of US democracy as they went. What does a deadly day mean for Trump's legacy? In pictures: Pro-Trump protesters storm Capitol Could Trump be removed from power? President-Elect Joe Biden has been scathing of the ""unacceptable"" handling of the rioters and compared it to the heavy-handed militarised response to last year's Black Lives Matter protests. Lindsey Graham, a Republican Senator, also railed against the security failures. ""They could have blown the building up. They could have killed us all. They could've destroyed the government,"" he said. Criticism centres on preparation by police and their failure to anticipate possible violence, despite evidence that radical pro-Trump supporters and other groups were openly discussing their plans online. This video can not be played Phone footage reveals chaotic scenes inside US Capitol The Washington Post, citing sources close to the matter,says that Capitol Police charged with guarding the building and its grounds did not make early requests for help from the city's main police force or the National Guard,externalnor set-up a multiagency command centre to coordinate response to any violence. And without an adequate security perimeter in place, their sparse police lines were quickly overwhelmed by thousands descending on the Capitol. Dozens of officers were injured, and one later died, in the effort to retake control -  including some with armour, weapons and chemical spray agents. To many, the optics were a sharp contrast to last year's protests following the death of George Floyd, when rows of National Guard Troops guarded and enforced order in the capital. The violence came against a surreal backdrop of US historical figures and scenes Even hours into Wednesday's violence, protesters were filmed being escorted or guided out of the building without arrest - even appearing to be helped down the Capitol stairs and having doors held open for them to exit. Another viral clip appeared to show a police officer posing for a selfie with a man inside. Many rioters photographed and even live-streamed their crimes. One was pictured, his face uncovered, with his feet up on House Speaker Nancy Pelosi's desk, and then showing off a letter he appeared to have stolen from her office. A Confederate flag was paraded by another unmasked man and a well-known conspiracy theorist - wearing horns, fur and facepaint - was seen posing by a Senate chair that had been occupied by Vice President Mike Pence just hours earlier. Nick Ochs, a known member of the Proud Boys far-right group, tweeted a selfie of himself inside and later told CNN: ""There were thousands of people in there - [the police] had no control of the situation. I didn't get stopped or questioned."" The striking image of Richard Barnett, 60, is one of several to have gone viral But despite the severity and scale of the chaos, relatively few arrests had been made by nightfall Wednesday. A visual guide to the Congress riots 'They tried to break in - then I heard a shot' Supporters of BLM and others on the left have voiced their outrage at the perceived double-standard of policing the events. The incoming vice-president, Kamala Harris, said the disconnect was ""unacceptable"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Former First Lady Michelle Obama also released a lengthy statement,external. ""I cannot think about moving on or turning the page until we reckon with the reality of what we saw yesterday,"" she wrote. ""True progress will be possible only once we acknowledge that this disconnect exists and take steps to repair it."" Top congressional Democrats Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi were damning in their criticism of security failures - helping to force the departures of top officials. The chief of the US Capitol Police, Steven Sund, had initially defended his force in a statement on Thursday - describing the actions of law enforcement as ""heroic"" and their plan robust. But within hours his resignation was announced, alongside the departures of the sergeant-at-arms for both the House and Senate. This video can not be played 'Treason, traitors and thugs'  - the words lawmakers used to describe Capitol riot Aside from the clear lack of preparation, confusion mounted during the violence about when and if other security forces were being deployed to help. According to the Washington Post,Pentagon officials had placed strict operational limits on the DC National Guard,externalahead of protests and remained concerned about the ""optics"" of armed military personnel at the Capitol. Defence officials on Thursday sought to defend the speed in which they authorised and mobilised Guardsmen to respond to the violence. Multiple US media outlets, citing senior sources, have suggested that President Donald Trump allegedly showed reluctance for the National Guard to be used to quell the unrest. If true, this is a complete contrast to the highly visible show of force the president has repeatedly called for against left-wing and BLM protesters. Gordon Corera, the BBC's security correspondent, says this emphasises how security decisions appear to have become politicised under the Trump administration. This video can not be played US Capitol riots: How the world's media reacted Professor Clifford Stott, a specialist in the policing of crowds who advises the UK government, has been analysing the police response to BLM protests in Seattle. He told the BBC there would be ""powerful and important"" questions to be asked about how officials failed to prepared for the escalation by Trump supporters. ""It was the failure to predict that that led them to be inadequately prepared when it did happen and led them to be reactive and have to mobilise more resources,"" he said.  ""It's not just about the complexities of the police response, it's also about what appears to be a poor level of risk assessments around how they understand whether resources might be necessary in the first place."" The gathering of the president's supporters, while Congress was certifying the election result, was not spontaneous. The protest was pre-planned and followed months of escalating rhetoric from President Trump and some of his Republican allies seeking to undermine the result. This video can not be played ""We will never give up, we will never concede"", Trump tells supporters In the days (and indeed weeks and months) before the attack, people monitoring online platforms used by extreme pro-Trump supporters and far-right groups had warned of rhetoric encouraging violence at the Capitol, including toward lawmakers, over the election result. Some were even pictured wearing clothing that said ""MAGA: CIVIL WAR"" printed alongside the 6 January 2021 date. Prof Stott, who researches the psychology of group violence and hooliganism, told the BBC he found the overarching mood of ""joy"" among rioters openly committing crimes particularly interesting. ""There was a very clear purpose to that crowd and that was driven by the idea their actions were legitimate, given their perception that their president - as their commander in chief - had sanctioned them to go and do this,"" he says. ""And that sense that Capitol Hill itself had been over taken by corruption."" How could 25th amendment be used? A history of violence at the US Capitol Some appeared confused and angry at why officers had used force against them. One Yahoo News video, viewed more than 25m times on TikTok, shows a woman visibly upset that she had been maced by police, despite declaring: ""We're storming the capitol - it's a revolution!""

Some radical supporters have responded with disbelief and frustration at the concession video shared by President Trump on Thursday following the violence. The U-turn came only a day after he told supporters: ""We will never give up, we will never concede"" and openly pressured his vice-president to overturn the election result. Vice-President Mike Pence is among those who have called for those involved in the breach to be prosecuted to the fullest extent of the law and given the brazen behaviour of many involved, prosecutors surely have no shortage of evidence to draw from. As Facebook moved to remove videos seen to incite or encourage the events, some open-source investigators called for people to archive evidence to help with crowdsourced identification. Meanwhile, many seen in viral images from inside are already known figures within far-right groups and QAnon and related conspiracy networks. Who stormed the Capitol? Dozens of people are already facing charges - including one man officials say had a semi-automatic rifle and 11 Molotov cocktails - and police have also appealed for help identifying offenders not yet in custody. Michael Sherwin, the acting US Attorney for DC, said on Thursday that prosecutors would bring ""the most maximum charges we can"", when asked if crimes such as seditious conspiracy and insurrection could be tabled. He also refused to rule out investigating anyone deemed to have incited the violence, including President Trump. ""We're trying to deal with the closest alligators to the boat right now,"" he said. ""Those are the people who obviously breached the Capitol, created violence and mayhem there and then exited. But yes, we are looking at all actors here, not only the people that went into the building.""

LiveLiveEngland lockdown compliance 'more vital than ever'1 minute ago,"More than 80,000 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test since the start of the pandemic Scientists advising the government say lockdown measures in England need to be stricter It comes as the government launches a new advertising campaign to try to boost compliance Government sources say there is likely to be more focus from police on enforcing rather than explaining rules The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have been vaccinated at Windsor Castle India will begin vaccinating its citizens next week and aims to vaccinate 300 million by July Saudi Arabiaâs King Salman Bin Abdulaziz has received his first dose of the vaccine, state media reports Edited by Sarah Collerton We are wrapping up the live page now, thanks for following our updates. They were brought to you by Sarah Collerton, Jennifer Meierhans, Victoria Lindrea and Sophie Williams. The live page will be finishing for the day soon so here's a look at the main headlines:  Some people across the UK have been able to form household support bubbles or extended households. The aim is to help people who've been cut off from friends and family. A bubble is an exclusive group of people with whom you have close physical contact. People in a bubble can stay overnight in each other's homes, visit outdoors places together and do not have to socially distance. In England the government has also created childcare support bubbles, allowing one other household to provide informal childcare. But who is eligible and what how do the rules differ between the nations? And what about bubbles in schools? Health editor Michelle Roberts explains. France is extending curfews in a bid to curb the spread of the virus Authorities in France are set to extend a curfew
to eight more regions as it tries to curb the spread of the virus. The entire country iscurrently under a curfew
from 8pm to 6am. However, in 15 of the worst affected regions, this was later adjusted to 6pm. A further eight regions will have the earlier
curfew enforced, Prime Minister Jean Castex said. He said it was a ""tough and necessary"" response. The new regions set to go under an earlier
curfew include the Bouches-du-Rhone region, home to Marseille. Rachael Powell is ""angry and upset"" about her daughter Emmeline missing out during lockdown New parents missing baby classes and playdates due to lockdown say their children's development has been hit by the impact of coronavirus. When Rachael Powell's one-year-old daughter Emmeline met her grandparents for the first time she ""absolutely screamed the place down"" as she ""didn't know who they were"". ""I was really looking forward to going to coffee shops, meeting other mums and going to baby classes and then everything stopped,"" says the 39-year-old from Greater Manchester. ""I felt guilty that she didn't get any of that and have that interaction."" Education consultant and child psychologist Paul Kelly says Covid is having a ""massive impact"" on babies. ""We are social creatures, social beings - it is pre-programmed in our brains,"" he says.

""When children's brains are stimulated, they grow."" Dr Kelly says there is also an impact on parents, who are missing out on ""mutual support"". He says people should ""grab what they can, when they can"" during these uncertain times and focus on ""how you can enhance [your baby's] development... rather than spending time thinking about how your child might be behind"".

These are specialist intensive care life support machines which pump oxygen into the patients blood, allowing the lungs to rest. There are only six NHS centres in the UK that offer the treatment to a few dozen patients, but now they're under pressure to take on more. Health correspondent Sophie Hutchinson was given rare access to an ECMO unit at the Royal Papworth Hospital in Cambridge: This video can not be played Two MPs have accused a police force of ""bias"" and ""inconsistency"" after officers issued fixed penalty notices to campaigners visiting a memorial. West Midlands Police gave fines to six people who attended a memorial to the victims of the Birmingham pub bombings. Among them was Julie Hambleton whose sister died in the November 1974 attack. Conservative MPs Gary Sambrook and Nicola Richards wrote to Chief Constable Sir Dave Thompson, asking for the decision to be reconsidered as the campaigners had been ""singled out"". ""It is deeply concerning and morally wrong to fine the victims' families of a terrorist attack who are campaigning for justice,"" they said. ""While mass protests have been allowed to go unchecked through our city throughout the year. This is an inconsistent approach and from the outside incredibly bias [sic]."" West Midlands Police has been contacted for a response and you can read about what happened in more detailhere. As we mentioned earlier, vaccinations are set to
begin in India next week. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the vaccinations,
which start on 16 January, are a ""landmark step"" in the fight against Covid. India is aiming to vaccinate 300 million people
by July. Frontline workers, those over 50 and other high
risk people will be the first to receive the vaccine. India has approved two vaccines â one produced by
Indian pharmaceutical Bharat Biotech and the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. The country has recorded more than 10 million
cases and 150,570 deaths since the pandemic began. Police battled to disperse the protestors gathering in Clapham Common Twelve people have been arrested during an anti-lockdown protest in south London. Police officers clashed with some of the mask-less protesters who arrived at Clapham Common, some shouting ""take your freedom back"". Gathering for the purpose of a protest is not an exemption to the rules, the Met Police said. Six police vans were deployed to the scene while officers moved crowds away from the area. One woman shouted from her car at the protesters ""there's a pandemic going"". You can read more and see pictures of the sceneshere. More than 80,000 peoplehave died in the UKwithin 28 days of a positive Covid test since the start of the pandemic. The number of daily deaths on Saturday was 1,035, taking the total to 80,868,according to data from the UK government.,external A total of 59,937 people have tested positive for Covid in the past 24 hours. Today's figures are slightly lower than yesterday's record number of deaths and cases - 1,325 and 68,053 respectively. Is any proof of vaccination being given which can be used in future for travel, theatre, restaurants and sporting events? asks Jane Hartley-Allen from Halstead Online health editor Michelle Roberts replies: A patient's medical record will be updated with information about the vaccine they have been given. There is no recommendation so far in the UK that people need proof of vaccination for reasons such as travel or socialising. And remember, if you have been vaccinated, it takes time for protection to build. No vaccine is 100% effective and we still do not know how long immunity will last. People who have received a coronavirus vaccine should continue to follow social distancing rules to protect themselves and others."" England, Northern Ireland, Wales and much of Scotland are under lockdown as cases of Covid-19 continue to rise. The main message across the UK is stay at home but if you're confused about the rules in your nation we've got them allhere. A survivor of the Aberfan disasterhas died after contracting Covid-19. As a nine-year-old, Bernard Thomas was rescued from the rubble of Pantglas primary school when the collapse of a mining tip outside the Welsh town of Aberfan left 144 people dead, including 116 school children. Thomas, who was later diagnosed with post-traumatic stress, died on Wednesday, aged 63. ""Bernard was a real character and his death has come as a shock to us as a family and the community of Aberfan,"" said his brother Andrew. ""We can't be sure where he caught Covid, but he had an eye appointment at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital on 21 December. ""A few days later, he became ill and at Prince Charles Hospital, he tested positive for Covid-19. ""Although he had been receiving oxygen through a mask, we spoke regularly on the phone and he told us he was getting better. ""But on Wednesday morning he removed his mask to eat his breakfast, and 10 minutes after eating he faded away. ""It's a huge shock, but I don't blame anybody."" Human rights group Amnesty International has criticised an order by Iran's leader banning vaccines made in the UK and US. On Friday, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
said he told authorities not to import vaccines from the two countries as he did not
trust them. In a statement, Amnesty International said the
move was âin step with authoritiesâ decades long contempt for human rights,
including the right to life and healthâ. Iran's Red Crescent society has announced it has
paused the import of 150,000 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, which it had organised. It comes as Twitter removed a tweet from the Iranian leader criticising the UK and US vaccines. Iran has recorded more than 1.2 million cases
and 56,018 deaths. We told you earlier about thetwo women in Derbyshire who were each fined Â£200 after they were stopped by policeofficers while going to walk at a site more than five miles from their home. Derbyshire police subsequently agreed to review the fines, after new guidance from the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) ""clarified the policing response concerning travel and exercise"". Jessica Allen and Eliza Moore, who criticised a police force for its ""intimidating"" approach to lockdown fines, have welcomed the review. Ms Allen said: ""We are happy to hear that Derbyshire Police have been told to not be so heavy handed with fines. ""We are yet to hear anything regarding our fine but if we have managed to save somebody the worry of going for a walk and fearing they would be fined then we have done what we set out to do."" Longstanding guidance from the College of Policing saysofficers should follow the ""Four Es"",externaland only give fixed penalty notices as a last resort. The Queen and Prince Philip have been vaccinated against Covid-19. âThe Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have today received
Covid-19 vaccinations,"" a Buckingham Palace spokesperson confirmed. A royal source said the vaccines were administered by a household doctor at Windsor Castle. Her
Majesty decided that she would let it be known that she and Prince Philip had received the vaccination to prevent inaccuracies and further speculation, they said. India is aiming to vaccinate 300 million people by July Here are some of the latest headlines from the world
today: The number of people being treated in Scotland's hospitals for coronavirus has reached another record daily high. Latest Scottish government figures show a total of 1,596 people are in hospital with recently confirmed Covid, up from 1,530 patients recorded on Friday. A further 93 people who had tested positive for the virus have died in the past 24 hours. The company offered to pay surgeries a Â£5,000 charitable donation ""or to the staff member directly"" in emails A property investment firm has apologised for offering GP surgeries in England Â£5,000 for unused coronavirus vaccine doses. The Hacking Trust's medical division approached surgeries in Bristol and Worthing offering to pay the money to charity ""or the staff member directly"". Robyn Clark, from the Institute of General Practice Management, says the move was ""just appalling"" and she felt the company was ""trying to jump the queue"". ""The NHS is free at the point of access for everyone who needs it,"" said Clark.

"Democrats to introduce Trump impeachment articleThe charge of ""incitement of insurrection"" is set to be tabled on Monday after riots at the Capitol.","Democrats are expected to introduce the article of impeachment against President Trump in the House of Representatives on Monday US Democrats plan to introduce an article of impeachment against President Donald Trump for his role in Wednesday's invasion of the US Capitol. House Speaker Nancy Pelosi said she would move forward with impeachment if Mr Trump did not resign immediately. The charge of ""incitement of insurrection"" is set to be introduced by House Democrats on Monday. They accuse Mr Trump of encouraging a riot in Congress in which five people died. President-elect Joe Biden said impeachment was for Congress to decide, but said he had thought ""for a long time President Trump was not fit to hold the job"". This video can not be played Voices from Trump land: 'We will continue to be divided' The White House dismissed the impeachment as a ""politically motivated"" move that would ""only serve to further divide our great country"". Nearly 160 House of Representatives Democrats have signed on to the bill, which congressmen Ted Lieu of California and David Cicilline of Rhode Island began drafting while they were sheltering in place during Wednesday's chaos at the Capitol. If the process does go ahead, it would be the second time the House has pursued impeachment against President Trump. In December 2019, the lower chamber impeached Mr Trump on charges of abuse of power and obstruction of Congress. But the Senate acquitted him on both charges in February 2020. Could Trump be removed from power? Trump acquitted by Senate in impeachment trial No US president has ever been impeached twice. However, the prospect of an impeachment conviction seems remote because of Mr Trump's Republican broad support in the Senate. One moderate Republican senator, Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, told the Anchorage Daily News on Friday that Trump simply ""needs to get out"". And Republican Senator Ben Sasse of Nebraska, a regular critic of Trump, said he would ""definitely consider"" impeachment. But there is so far no indication that enough members of the president's party would agree to convict him. This video can not be played Capitol riots: âWe would have been murderedâ That means an impeachment in the House might only be a symbolic action to hold Mr Trump accountable for the invasion of Congress. An internal Senate memo says the soonest it could take up any articles of impeachment from the House would be on 19 January, the day before Mr Trump's term expires, and a trial could only begin after he had left office. Constitutional experts are split on whether impeachment can still proceed to a Senate trial in this event. If convicted, Mr Trump would lose benefits granted to former presidents, and senators could vote to bar him permanently from public office. This video can not be played Trump calls for an 'orderly transition of power' to the Biden administration on January 20th The unprecedented move comes as an isolated Mr Trump holed up at the White House on Friday and his main means of communication with the outside world, Twitter, banned him from its platform. The siege of the Capitol has put senior politicians on edge, prompting the Democratic House Speaker Pelosi to talk to the nation's top military officer about ways to prevent Mr Trump from accessing nuclear codes. In a dramatic day in Washington DC on Friday, other developments included: Mr Trump has said he would not attend the inauguration of his successor, Mr Biden, on 20 January The FBI joined an investigation into the death of police officer Brian Sicknick from injuries sustained during the siege of the Capitol Dozens of people were arrested and several charged in relation to the assault on the Capitol building One of Mrs Pelosi's staff members revealed that a laptop was stolen from her office during the mob invasion Democrats and several prominent Republicans reiterated their calls for Mr Trump's cabinet to invoke constitutional powers and remove him from office The draft resolution, which has been shared with BBC partner CBS News, consists of one article: ""incitement of insurrection"". ""Donald John Trump engaged in high Crimes and Misdemeanours by willfully inciting violence against the Government of the United States,"" the draft reads. In the resolution, the lawmakers accuse the president of making statements that encouraged and resulted in ""imminent lawless action at the Capitol"". This video can not be played What does it take to impeach a president? The draft also says this was ""consistent with his prior efforts to subvert and obstruct"" the certification of President-elect Biden's win in November's presidential election. ""He thereby betrayed his trust as President, to the manifest injury of the people of the United States,"" the draft says. The president urged his supporters to march on the Capitol on the day Mr Biden's electoral college victory was to be confirmed by Congress. Americans 'shocked' and 'disgusted' by riots A visual guide to the Congress riots The US Air Force veteran who lost her life in riots He held a rally at which he repeatedly cast doubt on the legitimacy of the presidential election, alleging, without evidence, that it was ""stolen"" from him. ""We're going to walk down to the Capitol and we're going to cheer on our brave senators and Congressmen and women,"" Mr Trump told the crowd, exhorting his supporters ""to fight"". Democrats and some Republicans have argued that these words amounted to incitement. Impeachment allows Congress - the part of the US government that writes and brings in laws - to put presidents on trial. Articles of impeachment are charges brought against a president by the House of Representatives. If the House votes to pass them, proceedings move to the Senate, which decides whether or not to convict. It is a rare event and a political process, rather than a criminal one. This video can not be played The impeachment saga from beginning to end Mr Trump was the third US president to have been impeached. The two others, Bill Clinton in 1999 and Andrew Johnson in 1868, were left in office by the Senate. President Richard Nixon resigned before he could be impeached. On Wednesday, with Washington still reeling from the Capitol riot, Democrats held a conference call in which they talked for three hours about the prospect of removing the president from office. CBS News reports that Democrats were overwhelmingly supportive of the effort, with just one, Oregon Representative Kurt Schrader, arguing that such a move would be too divisive for the country. This video can not be played Phone footage reveals chaotic scenes inside US Capitol Mrs Pelosi told her members that her preference would be to see Mr Trump removed by the 25th Amendment, which allows the vice-president to step up if the president is unable to perform his duties owing to a mental or physical illness. If that did not happen, impeachment would be on the table, she said. US media reports say Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin has been personally involved in discussions about invoking the 25th Amendment. However, such a course of action is said to be highly unlikely, and there is no sign that Vice-President Pence is prepared to use the amendment. Five people died after incidents at the riots inside Congress On Friday, Mrs Pelosi called Mr Trump ""unhinged"" and said Congress must do everything possible to protect Americans while he is in office. In a later statement, Ms Pelosi said the House Democratic Caucus had a ""sad, moving and patriotic"" discussion about the possibility of impeachment.

"Salmond accuses Sturgeon of misleading parliamentHe claims Nicola Sturgeon's evidence to a sexual harassment inquiry was ""simply untrue"".Scotland politics","Ms Sturgeon has rejected claims made by former first minister Alex Salmond Alex Salmond has accused Nicola Sturgeon of misleading parliament, calling evidence she gave to an inquiry into the handling of sexual harassment claims against him ""simply untrue"". Mr Salmond's comments emerged in a written submission to a separate investigation into whether the first minister breached the ministerial code. The submission has been shared with the Holyrood committee. Ms Sturgeon says she ""entirely rejects Mr Salmond's claims"". In the submission, the former first minister said that Ms Sturgeon had misled parliament and broken the ministerial code with breaches including failing to inform the civil service in good time of her meetings with him. He claimed she allowed the Scottish government to contest a civil court case against him despite having had legal advice that it was likely to collapse. Ms Sturgeon told the Holyrood inquiry she had become aware of allegations at a meeting with Mr Salmond at her home. Nicola Sturgeon 'forgot' about meeting with Alex Salmond aide Nicola Sturgeon says husband 'being used as a weapon' against her It since emerged she met his former chief of staff in the days before, but she said she had forgotten about that meeting. Mr Salmond said that claim was untenable. His submission said that she misled parliament, and that amounted to a breach of the code. He also said she breached the code by failing to to inform civil servants of the nature of the meetings that took place between the two of them at her home where the allegations were discussed. Alex Salmond walked free from court in March having been cleared of charges of sexual assault Mr Salmond's statement read: ""The pre-arranged meeting in the Scottish Parliament of 29 March 2018 was ""forgotten"" about because acknowledging it would have rendered ridiculous the claim made by the first minister in parliament that it had been believed that the meeting on 2 April was on SNP Party business and thus held at her private residence."" Both Mr Salmond and Ms Sturgeon are expected to give evidence to the committee in the coming weeks. Scottish Conservative leader Douglas Ross responded to the claims, saying: ""Nobody ever bought Nicola Sturgeon's tall tales to have suddenly turned forgetful, especially about the devastating moment she found out of sexual harassment allegations against her friend and mentor of 30 years. ""What has been revealed are allegations of shocking, deliberate and corrupt actions at the heart of government. There is now clear evidence of Nicola Sturgeon abusing her power to deceive the Scottish public. ""If this proves to be correct, it is a resignation matter. No first minister, at any time, can be allowed to get away with repeatedly and blatantly lying to the Scottish Parliament and breaking the ministerial code."" Scottish Labour deputy leader Jackie Baillie said Alex Salmond's explosive allegations demanded answers from the first minister to the committee. She said: ""The bombshell accusation that Nicola Sturgeon has broken the ministerial code has the potential to end her political career and demands a robust and honest answer from the first minister. ""This committee demands truthfulness and honesty from every witness it calls - it is vital that the first minister tells the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth when she appears."" Ms Sturgeon has repeatedly dismissed any notion of a conspiracy against Mr Salmond. Her spokeswoman said: ""The first minister entirely rejects Mr Salmond's claims about the ministerial code. ""We should always remember that the roots of this issue lie in complaints made by women about Alex Salmond's behaviour whilst he was first minister, aspects of which he has conceded. It is not surprising therefore that he continues to try to divert focus from that by seeking to malign the reputation of the first minister and by spinning false conspiracy theories. ""The first minister is concentrating on fighting the pandemic, stands by what she has said, and will address these matters in full when she appears at committee."" Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Any Questions on Friday evening, SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford MP said he did not believe the accusations about the first minister were correct. He said: ""I believe that the first minister has acted in an honourable way, she's someone that I've every faith and trust in. ""I can tell you that the approval ratings for the first minister, the respect that she has right up and down the country of Scotland is enormous and this is something that will pass, when she appears in front of the committee these matters will be dealt with."" Alex Salmond has just turned up the heat on his successor with a submission that presents a direct and serious challenge to the reputation of Nicola Sturgeon - who was once his closest political ally. What he no doubt considers as an attempt to secure justice, some others will see as a case of deflection and revenge. Allegations of breaking the ministerial code of conduct and misleading parliament are serious and, if upheld, potentially career threatening. Yet even some of Ms Sturgeon's fiercest critics at Holyrood do not expect the inquiries into the Scottish government's mishandling of harassment complaints against Mr Salmond to force her from office. Mr Salmond seems to expect the review of the first minister's actions under the ministerial code of conduct to remain narrow enough that it could not possibly find against her. The first minister herself appears confident of persuading all comers, including a cross-party committee of MSPs (before which both she and Mr Salmond are due to appear in the coming weeks) that she has acted properly throughout.

LiveLiveEngland lockdown compliance 'more vital than ever'A new campaign is launched to urge people not to become complacent about the Covid restrictions.World,"More than 80,000 people have died in the UK within 28 days of a positive Covid test since the start of the pandemic Scientists advising the government say lockdown measures in England need to be stricter It comes as the government launches a new advertising campaign to try to boost compliance Government sources say there is likely to be more focus from police on enforcing rather than explaining rules The Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have been vaccinated at Windsor Castle India will begin vaccinating its citizens next week and aims to vaccinate 300 million by July Saudi Arabiaâs King Salman Bin Abdulaziz has received his first dose of the vaccine, state media reports Edited by Sarah Collerton We are wrapping up the live page now, thanks for following our updates. They were brought to you by Sarah Collerton, Jennifer Meierhans, Victoria Lindrea and Sophie Williams. The live page will be finishing for the day soon so here's a look at the main headlines:  Some people across the UK have been able to form household support bubbles or extended households. The aim is to help people who've been cut off from friends and family. A bubble is an exclusive group of people with whom you have close physical contact. People in a bubble can stay overnight in each other's homes, visit outdoors places together and do not have to socially distance. In England the government has also created childcare support bubbles, allowing one other household to provide informal childcare. But who is eligible and what how do the rules differ between the nations? And what about bubbles in schools? Health editor Michelle Roberts explains. France is extending curfews in a bid to curb the spread of the virus Authorities in France are set to extend a curfew
to eight more regions as it tries to curb the spread of the virus. The entire country iscurrently under a curfew
from 8pm to 6am. However, in 15 of the worst affected regions, this was later adjusted to 6pm. A further eight regions will have the earlier
curfew enforced, Prime Minister Jean Castex said. He said it was a ""tough and necessary"" response. The new regions set to go under an earlier
curfew include the Bouches-du-Rhone region, home to Marseille. Rachael Powell is ""angry and upset"" about her daughter Emmeline missing out during lockdown New parents missing baby classes and playdates due to lockdown say their children's development has been hit by the impact of coronavirus. When Rachael Powell's one-year-old daughter Emmeline met her grandparents for the first time she ""absolutely screamed the place down"" as she ""didn't know who they were"". ""I was really looking forward to going to coffee shops, meeting other mums and going to baby classes and then everything stopped,"" says the 39-year-old from Greater Manchester. ""I felt guilty that she didn't get any of that and have that interaction."" Education consultant and child psychologist Paul Kelly says Covid is having a ""massive impact"" on babies. ""We are social creatures, social beings - it is pre-programmed in our brains,"" he says.

""When children's brains are stimulated, they grow."" Dr Kelly says there is also an impact on parents, who are missing out on ""mutual support"". He says people should ""grab what they can, when they can"" during these uncertain times and focus on ""how you can enhance [your baby's] development... rather than spending time thinking about how your child might be behind"".

These are specialist intensive care life support machines which pump oxygen into the patients blood, allowing the lungs to rest. There are only six NHS centres in the UK that offer the treatment to a few dozen patients, but now they're under pressure to take on more. Health correspondent Sophie Hutchinson was given rare access to an ECMO unit at the Royal Papworth Hospital in Cambridge: This video can not be played Two MPs have accused a police force of ""bias"" and ""inconsistency"" after officers issued fixed penalty notices to campaigners visiting a memorial. West Midlands Police gave fines to six people who attended a memorial to the victims of the Birmingham pub bombings. Among them was Julie Hambleton whose sister died in the November 1974 attack. Conservative MPs Gary Sambrook and Nicola Richards wrote to Chief Constable Sir Dave Thompson, asking for the decision to be reconsidered as the campaigners had been ""singled out"". ""It is deeply concerning and morally wrong to fine the victims' families of a terrorist attack who are campaigning for justice,"" they said. ""While mass protests have been allowed to go unchecked through our city throughout the year. This is an inconsistent approach and from the outside incredibly bias [sic]."" West Midlands Police has been contacted for a response and you can read about what happened in more detailhere. As we mentioned earlier, vaccinations are set to
begin in India next week. Prime Minister Narendra Modi said the vaccinations,
which start on 16 January, are a ""landmark step"" in the fight against Covid. India is aiming to vaccinate 300 million people
by July. Frontline workers, those over 50 and other high
risk people will be the first to receive the vaccine. India has approved two vaccines â one produced by
Indian pharmaceutical Bharat Biotech and the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine. The country has recorded more than 10 million
cases and 150,570 deaths since the pandemic began. Police battled to disperse the protestors gathering in Clapham Common Twelve people have been arrested during an anti-lockdown protest in south London. Police officers clashed with some of the mask-less protesters who arrived at Clapham Common, some shouting ""take your freedom back"". Gathering for the purpose of a protest is not an exemption to the rules, the Met Police said. Six police vans were deployed to the scene while officers moved crowds away from the area. One woman shouted from her car at the protesters ""there's a pandemic going"". You can read more and see pictures of the sceneshere. More than 80,000 peoplehave died in the UKwithin 28 days of a positive Covid test since the start of the pandemic. The number of daily deaths on Saturday was 1,035, taking the total to 80,868,according to data from the UK government.,external A total of 59,937 people have tested positive for Covid in the past 24 hours. Today's figures are slightly lower than yesterday's record number of deaths and cases - 1,325 and 68,053 respectively. Is any proof of vaccination being given which can be used in future for travel, theatre, restaurants and sporting events? asks Jane Hartley-Allen from Halstead Online health editor Michelle Roberts replies: A patient's medical record will be updated with information about the vaccine they have been given. There is no recommendation so far in the UK that people need proof of vaccination for reasons such as travel or socialising. And remember, if you have been vaccinated, it takes time for protection to build. No vaccine is 100% effective and we still do not know how long immunity will last. People who have received a coronavirus vaccine should continue to follow social distancing rules to protect themselves and others."" England, Northern Ireland, Wales and much of Scotland are under lockdown as cases of Covid-19 continue to rise. The main message across the UK is stay at home but if you're confused about the rules in your nation we've got them allhere. A survivor of the Aberfan disasterhas died after contracting Covid-19. As a nine-year-old, Bernard Thomas was rescued from the rubble of Pantglas primary school when the collapse of a mining tip outside the Welsh town of Aberfan left 144 people dead, including 116 school children. Thomas, who was later diagnosed with post-traumatic stress, died on Wednesday, aged 63. ""Bernard was a real character and his death has come as a shock to us as a family and the community of Aberfan,"" said his brother Andrew. ""We can't be sure where he caught Covid, but he had an eye appointment at the Royal Glamorgan Hospital on 21 December. ""A few days later, he became ill and at Prince Charles Hospital, he tested positive for Covid-19. ""Although he had been receiving oxygen through a mask, we spoke regularly on the phone and he told us he was getting better. ""But on Wednesday morning he removed his mask to eat his breakfast, and 10 minutes after eating he faded away. ""It's a huge shock, but I don't blame anybody."" Human rights group Amnesty International has criticised an order by Iran's leader banning vaccines made in the UK and US. On Friday, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei
said he told authorities not to import vaccines from the two countries as he did not
trust them. In a statement, Amnesty International said the
move was âin step with authoritiesâ decades long contempt for human rights,
including the right to life and healthâ. Iran's Red Crescent society has announced it has
paused the import of 150,000 doses of Pfizer-BioNTech vaccines, which it had organised. It comes as Twitter removed a tweet from the Iranian leader criticising the UK and US vaccines. Iran has recorded more than 1.2 million cases
and 56,018 deaths. We told you earlier about thetwo women in Derbyshire who were each fined Â£200 after they were stopped by policeofficers while going to walk at a site more than five miles from their home. Derbyshire police subsequently agreed to review the fines, after new guidance from the National Police Chiefs Council (NPCC) ""clarified the policing response concerning travel and exercise"". Jessica Allen and Eliza Moore, who criticised a police force for its ""intimidating"" approach to lockdown fines, have welcomed the review. Ms Allen said: ""We are happy to hear that Derbyshire Police have been told to not be so heavy handed with fines. ""We are yet to hear anything regarding our fine but if we have managed to save somebody the worry of going for a walk and fearing they would be fined then we have done what we set out to do."" Longstanding guidance from the College of Policing saysofficers should follow the ""Four Es"",externaland only give fixed penalty notices as a last resort. The Queen and Prince Philip have been vaccinated against Covid-19. âThe Queen and the Duke of Edinburgh have today received
Covid-19 vaccinations,"" a Buckingham Palace spokesperson confirmed. A royal source said the vaccines were administered by a household doctor at Windsor Castle. Her
Majesty decided that she would let it be known that she and Prince Philip had received the vaccination to prevent inaccuracies and further speculation, they said. India is aiming to vaccinate 300 million people by July Here are some of the latest headlines from the world
today: The number of people being treated in Scotland's hospitals for coronavirus has reached another record daily high. Latest Scottish government figures show a total of 1,596 people are in hospital with recently confirmed Covid, up from 1,530 patients recorded on Friday. A further 93 people who had tested positive for the virus have died in the past 24 hours. The company offered to pay surgeries a Â£5,000 charitable donation ""or to the staff member directly"" in emails A property investment firm has apologised for offering GP surgeries in England Â£5,000 for unused coronavirus vaccine doses. The Hacking Trust's medical division approached surgeries in Bristol and Worthing offering to pay the money to charity ""or the staff member directly"". Robyn Clark, from the Institute of General Practice Management, says the move was ""just appalling"" and she felt the company was ""trying to jump the queue"". ""The NHS is free at the point of access for everyone who needs it,"" said Clark. A statement from the London-based company says: ""We had heard that some vaccines were being unused due to missed appointments. We would apologise that our good intentions have been misinterpreted.""

West Ham manager David Moyes says: ""We have to be careful that everybody isn't picking on football players.""

Moyes says footballers are ""like most human beings at times, they can get things wrong"" and ""a lot of people are throwing stones in glass houses"".

"Nurse's 'overwhelming fear' as 13 ambulances queueAs Covid patients waited at Royal Glamorgan Hospital the nurse had a fear of ""wanting to leave"".Wales","This video can not be played Senior doctor Amanda Farrow said the hospital faced ""unrelenting"" pressure A nurse felt ""overwhelming fear"" as 13 ambulances queued at her hospital's A&E department - in the Welsh region currently hardest hit by Covid deaths. To date Cwm Taf Morgannwg health board, which runs Royal Glamorgan Hospital, has reported 1,091 deaths of patients with coronavirus. BBC Wales was granted access to A&E at the hospital in Rhondda Cynon Taf. Senior doctor Amanda Farrow said the whole hospital had faced ""unrelenting"" pressure last Saturday. Sarah Fogarasy was the senior nurse on duty as 13 ambulances queued up outside her A&E department Senior A&E nurse Sarah Fogarasy, who was on shift as the ambulances arrived, said there was no capacity at the unit - a situation that left her wanting ""to leave"". ""We had to escalate it to our site manager and deputy head of nursing who were liaising with the executive team on call,"" she said. ""And then it got to 13 patients outside - I had no capacity in this unit, no resuscitation capacity, no capacity to put a patient on CPAP [continuous positive airway pressure] should they require that and no physical areas to put a patient in. ""It was overwhelming."" On Saturday, 13 ambulances queued outside the hospital's A&E department She said she found it hard to keep going. ""This bit makes me quite emotionalâ¦ for the first time I was sat trying to coordinate this department and I had that overwhelming fear that I just wanted to leave,"" Ms Fogarasy continued. ""I was just - 'I'm done. I'm done with this'... and it's scary, it fills you full of fear when you have got 13 ambulances outside, queuing around the carpark. Where do you go from that?"" She said it was the team that kept her going: ""I started looking around to all the staff working tirelessly and just trying to remember what we're here for and why I became a nurse. ""I know it sounds soppy but it's literally the humanitarian effort that has gone into [fighting] this pandemic that has kept people going. ""It's the sheer determination and guts of the staff working in these times that is so powerful, that keeps the shift going."" Emergency Medicine Consultant Amanda Farrow said it was a ""very emotional time for everyone"" Dr Farrow, emergency medicine consultant, said staffing and bed numbers were of particular concern. ""In the emergency department the challenge we have is with regards to flow, so that is our daily challenge,"" she explained. ""And we say it's like playing a game of Tetris trying to work out which patient you can put where."" Staff reported feeling overwhelmed as they work through the second Covid wave She said the second wave of the virus had also seen more staff off sick with Covid and isolating - with some becoming very ill. ""We've had staff in as patients and one of my colleagues - I saw them when they were critically ill and ended up going to intensive care,"" continued Dr Farrow. ""So it's very emotional time for everyone as well you know, looking after the sick patients and looking after your colleagues. ""There's a level of anxiety still around -  will you be the next person to get this disease?"" She said although fewer people were attending A&E, they were seeing more people arriving by ambulance and presenting with more complex needs. ""The group of patients we are seeing this time I think is different, we're definitely having more younger people with Covid that are becoming sick, the volume is very high in the community. ""I think people are afraid of come into the hospital as well, so there are still quite a lot of patients who leave it maybe a bit too late before they're seeking hospital attention."" Speaking from her intensive care bed, Helen Whatmore said she was extremely grateful to staff Helen Whatmore, 45, from Beddau, has been hospital since early December after developing Covid symptoms. Speaking from her intensive care bed, she said she had been unwell in February so assumed she had already caught the virus. ""I honestly didn't believe it was as bad until I caught [Covid] this time,"" she said. ""This time it's absolutely knocked the socks off me. It's nearly killed me. ""A friend of mine passed away as I came into hospital and I came down very rapidly with Covid, kidney problems and pneumonia."" She said she was grateful for the care she had received: ""The nurses are coming in [working] all shifts, they're fighting for your loved ones, from the time they enter right until the time they leave, then they're changing over and doing the same again. ""People are passing awayâ¦ how much more have they got to do? We're asking them to protect our children and our families. Why are we not protecting them ourselves? Saving our families and our own children."" At least 10 confirmed dead in Los Angeles wildfires What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Ex-MP quits Labour ahead of disciplinary processKelvin Hopkins has previously denied claims by a party activist of inappropriate physical contact.,"Kelvin Hopkins, 79, has denied sexual harassment allegations A former Labour MP has quit the party before disciplinary proceedings against him concerning sexual harassment could be concluded, Labour has said. Kelvin Hopkins was suspended by the party in 2017 after a Labour activist, Ava Etemadzadeh, accused him of inappropriate physical contact. Ms Etemadzadeh said the ex-MP's exit from the party was ""disappointing"". The BBC has attempted to contact Mr Hopkins, 79, for a response, but he has previously denied the accusations. A Labour spokesperson said it ""takes all complaints of sexual harassment extremely seriously and they are fully investigated in line with our rules and procedures, and any appropriate disciplinary action is taken. ""We are disappointed that the party's disciplinary processes did not reach a conclusion due to Kelvin Hopkins' decision to resign his membership,"" they added. ""We are establishing an independent process to investigate complaints, including sexual harassment, to ensure complainants can feel confident that in coming forward they will be heard and get the justice they deserve."" Mr Hopkins, who first won the seat of Luton North from the Conservatives in 1997, stood down ahead of the 2019 election - a decision, he said, which was to do with his wife's health, not the accusations. He had originally been referred to the party's National Constitutional Committee following the allegations in 2017 and had expressed frustration at the length of time the hearing was taking. Responding to his decision to leave the party, Ms Etemadzadeh tweeted: ""This is very disappointing news. I hope Keir Starmer listens to my concerns and fixes this broken system.""

Kim vows to expand North Korea's nuclear arsenal,"North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said US policy towards his country would ""never change"" North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has said the US is his country's ""biggest enemy"" and that he does not expect Washington to change its policy toward Pyongyang - whoever is president. Addressing a rare congress of his ruling Workers' Party, Mr Kim also pledged to expand North Korea's nuclear weapons arsenal and military potential. He said that plans for a nuclear submarine were almost complete. His comments come as US President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take office. Analysts suggest Mr Kim's remarks are an effort to apply pressure on the incoming government, with Mr Biden set to be sworn in on 20 January. Mr Kim enjoyed a warm rapport with outgoing US President Donald Trump, even if little concrete progress was made on negotiations over North Korea's nuclear programme. North Korea's missile and nuclear programme Watch: North Korea hosts military spectacle What does North Korea want? This video can not be played North Korea's Kim Jong-un chokes up during speech In his latest address to the Workers' Party - only the eighth congress in its history - Mr Kim said Pyongyang did not intend to use its nuclear weapons unless ""hostile forces"" were planning to use them against North Korea first. He said the US was his country's ""biggest obstacle for our revolution and our biggest enemy... no matter who is in power, the true nature of its policy against North Korea will never change,"" state news agency KCNA reported. His speech outlined a list of desired weapons including long-range ballistic missiles capable of being launched from land or sea and ""super-large warheads"". North Korea has managed to significantly advance its arsenal despite being subject to strict economic sanctions. Earlier this week, Mr Kim admitted that hisfive-year economic plan for the isolated country failed to meet its targetsin ""almost every sector"". North Korea closed its borders last January to prevent Covid from entering the country. Its authorities say the country has not had a single Covid case since the pandemic began butexperts say this is highly unlikelydue to North Korea's cross-border trade with China. Trade with China has plummeted by about 80%. Typhoons and floods have devastated homes and crops in North Korea, which remains under strict international sanctions, including over its nuclear programme. The speech is likely to be Mr Kim's way of setting the stage for talks with President-elect Joe Biden who will take office in less than two weeks' time. The aim is perhaps to put pressure on Washington to show that Pyongyang has no intention of being cowed by sanctions and will continue to expand its nuclear arsenal. Mr Kim had three summits with Donald Trump - but they failed to reach a deal. However, North Korea is in a difficult and bleak economic position caused by strict sanctions, border blockades to prevent the spread of Covid-19 and devastating floods. This message may seem threatening, but some analysts believe that there is still room for diplomacy.

Europe's slow start: How many have had the jab?,"A 78-year-old French woman received the first dose of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine in France A global race is on to vaccinate people against Covid-19 - and with infections soaring in Europe many have complained that the roll-out is too slow in the EU. Member states decide individually who to vaccinate, when and where, but the EU is coordinating strategy and buying vaccines in bulk. On Friday, the EU Commission agreed to buy an extra 300 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine - that would give the EU nearly half of the firm's global output for 2021. BBC reporters in seven European capitals explain how the vaccinations are going on their patch. Whatâs happening to the EU vaccine scheme? The country shocked to be Europe's stragglers In an election year, the vaccine has become a political battleground, writesJenny Hill, in Berlin. The fact it was German scientists who developed the first effective Covid vaccine has been the source of great national pride. And, by and large, Germans appear to be reasonably comfortable with the idea of immunisation. A recent survey found 65% were prepared to have the vaccine. Other research indicates that less than a quarter of those surveyed would not. But politically - and perhaps unsurprisingly, given this is an election year - Germany's vaccination programme has become a battleground. Vaccinations began here just under two weeks ago and prioritise the over 80s and care home workers. By Thursday evening, more than477,000first doses had been administered. But some of the hundreds of specially prepared vaccination centres are still not in use and even the government has admitted there simply isn't enough to go around. Angela Merkel and her health minister Jens Spahn have been accused of failing to secure enough doses. Much of the criticism has come from Mrs Merkel's own coalition partners but some within the scientific community have echoed their concerns - that Germany put European interests above its own by insisting on a joint EU procurement process. The scientists who developed the vaccine have said publicly that the EU originally turned down an offer for a further order. Germany's share of the EU order amounts to 56 million doses. So far, 1.3 million doses have been delivered and it's thought that by the end of the month a further 2.68 million will have followed. Mr Spahn, whose assured performance through the pandemic led some to wonder whether he might be a potential successor to Mrs Merkel, has blamed the shortage on the inability of the manufacturers of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine to meet global demand. Germany has now ordered an extra 30 million doses and, following the recent European approval of the Moderna vaccine, expects to start rolling that out next week. The government is sticking to its pledge that the vaccination programme will be complete by the end of the summer. The Czech prime minister has hit out at apparent delays in distributing the vaccine, writesRob Cameron, in Prague. The Czech vaccination effort began on 27 December, when the prime minister, Andrej Babis, became the first person in the country to receive the jab. Mr Babis, who is 66, had previously questioned whether he would be eligible, as he'd had his spleen removed as a teenager. But the country's programme has got off to a sluggish start. Mr Babis - a billionaire businessman who has been dogged by both European and Czech investigations into alleged misuse of EU funds - has lost no time venting his (figurative) spleen at the European Commission over the delay. ""We believed when we contributed â¬12m to the European fund in November that we'd receive the vaccine,"" he told a newspaper this week. The country has received 30,000 doses of the Pfizer vaccine. So far, it has managed to administer it to19,918people. The government says it is ready to roll out the jab en masse as soon as supplies arrive from the manufacturers. It has also published a strategy, which envisages a three-stage process. The first will see targeted vaccination of high-risk groups. This will gradually give way to mass vaccination in 31 centres, using an online reservation system that will be open to all from 1 February. And the final stage will see the country's GPs deployed, hopefully to administer the Oxford-AstraZeneca and other jabs, which unlike the previous two can be stored and transported at fridge temperature. However, the timing in the original strategy document now appears optimistic. The health minister conceded this week that immunising the higher-risk groups - all health and social care staff, teachers, everyone over 65, all those with serious health conditions - will take months. GPs may not begin vaccinating young, healthy members of society until late spring, or summer. A sluggish start is being blamed on bureaucracy and vaccine scepticism, writesHugh Schofield, in Paris. France's boast of a big, effective state apparatus has been badly exposed by the sluggish start to the Covid vaccination programme. After the first week, when neighbouring Germany had inoculated around 250,000 people, France was on a mere 530. By Friday, the figure had gone up to45,500- still so small as to be statistically meaningless. So why has it taken so long for France to put the plan into action? It is not as if the authorities did not have time to prepare. And it is certainly not a question of a lack of vaccine. In fact, more than a million Pfizer doses are already in cold storage, waiting to be used. The primary reason for the delay seems to be the cumbersome, over-centralised nature of France's health bureaucracy. A 45-page dossier of instructions issued by the ministry in Paris had to be read and understood by staff at old people's homes. Each recipient then had to give informed consent in a consultation with a doctor, held no less than five days before injection.   The lengthy procedure is in theory to save lives - those of patients who might have an adverse reaction. But as the critics have been arguing, delay in inoculating the population is also costing lives. Another problem in France is the high level of scepticism towards vaccination - product of a more general suspicion of government. Polls suggest as many as 58% of the public do not want to be given the jab. The effect - critics say - has been to make the government unduly cautious. When urgency was required, the authorities were reluctant to move fast for fear of galvanising the anti-vaxxers. After President Emmanuel Macron communicated his anger at the delays at the weekend, the pace is picking up. The procedure for consent is being simplified. By the end of January, the plan is to have 500-600 vaccination centres open across the country - either in hospitals or other big public buildings. Politically a lot is at stake. The government has already come under fire for failings in providing masks and tests. With opposition voices calling the vaccine delay a ""state scandal"", President Macron needs a roll-out that is fast and problem-free. France's vaccine drive has challenging start National pride accelerated Russia's rollout, but one man is conspicuously absent from the list of people vaccinated, writesSarah Rainsford, in Moscow. Russia registered its main Covid vaccine for domestic use way back in August, before mass safety and efficacy trials had even begun. In December, with those trials still underway, it began rolling out Sputnik V to the public ahead of mass vaccination launches everywhere else in Europe. The rush was driven by national pride as well as medical necessity. Sputnik was initially offered to front line health and education workers but early take-up of the two-dose vaccination was slow and the list of those eligible soon expanded. A poll by the Levada Centre in late December showed only 38% of respondents were willing to get the jab: wary of domestic healthcare and medicines, Russians were sceptical of bold early claims made for the vaccine and nervous about possible adverse reactions. Even so, and despite similar delays scaling-up production as in other countries, Sputnik's backers announced this week thatmore than a million peoplehad been vaccinated. Russia began rolling out its Sputnik V vaccine in December But one man still conspicuously absent from the list of the vaccinated is Vladimir Putin, despite the Kremlin saying he will - eventually - get the jab. In the meantime, those who meet him in person are obliged to test for Covid first and even quarantine. The president may need to lead by example, though. Mr Putin has said repeatedly that protecting the economy is his priority so he's banking on mass vaccination to avoid a return to national lockdown. Russia has built giant, temporary hospitals since the start of the pandemic and the health minister said this week that 25% of Covid beds remain free. There's also been a fall in the number of new daily cases reported - around 25,000 for the past 5 days. But that's not down to the vaccine yet. The country is nearing the end of a 10-day New Year holiday period and the number of Covid tests has also dropped. As infection rates grow in a country praised by many for its no-lockdown approach, a successful vaccine programme is crucial writesMaddy Savage, in Stockholm. Almost two weeks since 91-year-old care home resident Gun-Britt Johnsson became the first Swede to get the initial dose of a Pfizer jab, there is stillno official tallyof how many others have received the vaccination. The Public Health Agency of Sweden says it's in the process of compiling data from the country's 21 regional health authorities tasked with vaccinating the entire adult population - around eight million people - by 26 June. The date isn't arbitrary, it's the biggest public holiday weekend of the year, when Swedes traditionally hold Midsummer celebrations. Karin Tegmark, a senior manager at the agency, says the date remains ""feasible"". But she says it depends on the delivery of vaccines to the country. Alongside 4.5 million doses of the Pfizer-BioNTech vaccine, Sweden has ordered 3.6 million jabs from Moderna, the first of which are expected to arrive next week. The country also plans to roll-out the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine as soon as possible after it is approved by the EU - ideally by February. Swedes initially appeared lukewarm to the idea of taking a speedily-developed coronavirus vaccine, although a poll at the end of December found 71% would take one. A key driver of the initial scepticism is thought to be the failure of a voluntary mass vaccination programme for swine flu in 2009. Hundreds of Swedish children and young adults under 30 developed the sleeping disorder narcolepsy, which was found to be a side effect of the Pandemrix vaccine. A successful vaccination programme will be crucial, not least because it comes at a time when Swedish authorities are struggling to maintain public confidence. After months of high trust levels in the country's no-lockdown approach, support for the health agency has dwindled as Sweden has struggled with the second wave of coronavirus. Meanwhile, several high profile officials have faced heavy criticism for breaching their own recommendations - including the head of the civil contingencies agency (pictured), who resigned after spending Christmas with his daughter in the Canary Islands. A new government in Belgium seems unified on the vaccine rollout - for now at least, writesNick Beake, in Brussels. It seemed fitting that the first person in Belgium to receive a Covid jab lives in the place where the world's first approved Covid vaccine is being produced. Jos Hermans, a 96-year-old from the municipality of Puurs, was given the injection on 28 December, in his care home. A further700elderly residents were also administered a dose in what was a small, initial trial. The mass vaccination programme in Belgium began on 5 January, but has been criticised for starting slowly. Federal Health Minister Frank Vandenbroucke had promised in November that the rollout would be ""seamless and fast"", tweeting: ""If that does not work, shoot me."" The first phase looks to vaccinate up to 200,000 nursing home residents by the end of this month, or early February. Healthcare professionals will be next in line and the aim was for the whole population to be inoculated by the end of September. Jos Hermans, a 96-year-old from Puurs, was given the injection on 28 December You may think the country would be at an advantage being the epicentre of the Pfizer-BioNTech production. While this clearly helps with distribution, Belgium cannot receive more doses - relative to its population - than other EU countries under strict Commission rules. That didn't stop the minister-president of the Flanders region, who admitted this week that he had contacted Pfizer directly in the hope of procuring more doses, only to be rebuffed. After getting a guarantee from Pfizer over supply of the jab, the federal Belgian authorities have adapted their strategy: they now propose giving as many available doses to as many people as they can - and no longer reserving vials for patients' second dose, given three weeks after the first. In general, the federal government, rather than the European Commission has faced any criticism for a delay and has defended its ""careful"" approach. And there appears to be an interesting regional or cultural discrepancy when it comes to whether people are willing to take the vaccine. Of the Flemish population interviewed in a poll, half have said they wanted the vaccine as soon as possible. Among French speakers - it was 20% fewer, which chimes with the deeper scepticism over the border in France. In a country where politics are notoriously complicated and fractious - they've only recently agreed a government, after a 500-day vacuum - the Federal Coalition appears unified on its Covid vaccine strategy. For now, at least. Regional variances and political rows have marked the beginning of Spain's vaccination programme writesGuy Hedgecoe, in Madrid. Spain started administering the vaccine on 27 December. So far, 743,925 doses have been distributed to regional administrations, with277,976people vaccinated, according to the health ministry. The objective of the coalition government is to immunise 2.3 million people within 12 weeks. Priority is being given to elderly residents of care homes, those who look after them, and healthcare personnel. Each of the country's 17 regions has a high degree of control over healthcare and should receive the number of doses that corresponds to their populations. However, already there has been substantial geographical disparity. Government data showed, for example, that while the northern region of Asturias had used 55% of the doses it had received by 3 January, the Madrid region had only administered 5% by the same date. Some regions are holding back doses to administer a second follow-up jab to the same person in several weeks' time, and some have been vaccinating on national holidays while others have not. Although vaccination is voluntary, the government has said it is making a register of those who do not wish to be inoculated. That initiative has generated controversy, although the government has insisted the register will merely seek to clarify why people refuse the vaccination. However, the pandemic has been the cause of constant political conflict, with the right-wing opposition accusing the leftist government of Pedro SÃ¡nchez of incompetence, lack of transparency and using coronavirus to accumulate power. The arrival of a vaccine has not stopped the rancour. Alberto NÃºÃ±ez FeijÃ³o, the conservative Popular Party (PP) president of Galicia, warned the number of doses being distributed to each region was being dictated by ""political affiliations or parliamentary needs"", a claim the central government has rejected.

Prince William's comments were part of a video call to London hospital staff. ""Catherine and I and all the children talk about all of you guys every day, so we're making sure the children understand all of the sacrifices that all of you are making,"" he said. It comes after the London mayor said the virus was ""out of control"". Sadiq Khan declared a major incident on Friday- meaning the emergency services and hospitals cannot guarantee their normal level of response - after the number of Covid patients in the capital's hospitals surpassed 7,000. Staff at Homerton University Hospital in east London told the Duke of Cambridge that queues of people waiting to be vaccinated at the hospital offered hope, but that the way out of the crisis was for the public to ""stay at home"" during lockdown. In recent days the hospital has seen its highest number of admissions since the pandemic began. During the UK's first national lockdown, the Duke and Duchess of Cambridge and their three children Prince George (left), Princess Charlotte and Prince Louis joined in with the weekly Clap for Carers event The duke, who is joint patron of NHS Charities Together, said: ""A huge thank you for all the hard work, the sleepless nights, the lack of sleep, the anxiety, the exhaustion and everything that you are doing, we are so grateful. ""Good luck, we are all thinking of you."" His video call, which took place on Thursday, is one of many he and the duchess have made to NHS staff during the pandemic.

""For us this week, starting vaccinating has been one of the single most significant impacts on people feeling that there is a future out of this, and the queues out the door here where they have been vaccinating have been really hopeful for people,"" she said. ""But the support we need is stay at home, help us. Because that will get us all out of this, whatever our role is, and we will get society out of this.""

"Brexit sees M&S cut hundreds of products in NICriticism of new Brexit trade rules is growing as firms warn of more bureaucracy, higher costs and delays.","Marks & Spencer has temporarily stopped selling hundreds of items in its Northern Ireland stores due to Brexit red tape. The retailer said it feared its food would be blocked due to new rules governing shipments between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. A growing number of firms have spoken out about paperwork delays at ports. The government said traders and hauliers need to take steps to comply with new border rules. M&S took the decision to temporarily drop hundreds of products, including chocolate fudge pudding and sweet and sour chicken, from its Northern Ireland stores after it saw competitors' lorries barred from travelling between the mainland and Northern Ireland. An entire consignment in a lorry can be held up if only one item in the truck doesn't have the correct customs forms filled out. The retailer said it aimed to get the products back up for sale soon. An M&S spokesperson said: ""We have served customers in Northern Ireland for over 50 years and our priority is to make sure we continue to deliver the same choice and great quality range that our loyal customers have always enjoyed. ""Stores have been receiving regular deliveries this week, however following the UK's recent departure from the EU, we are transitioning to new processes and we're working closely with our partners and suppliers to ensure customers can continue to enjoy a great range of products."" In addition to problems shipping goods internally in the UK, the new Brexit trade rules are creating problems for exporters and traders transporting goods to and from the EU, say firms. The UK sealed a trade deal with the European Union (EU) on 24 December that was billed as preserving its zero-tariff and zero-quota access to the bloc's single market. But in addition to red tape causing delays, major retailers that use the UK as a distribution hub for European business could face possible tariffs if they re-export goods to the EU. On Friday, M&S chief executive Steve Rowe warned of more red tape and a rise in export costs to some countries. ""The best example I can give you of that is Percy Pig,"" he said, ""Percy Pig is actually manufactured in Germany. If it comes to the UK and we then send it to Ireland, in theory it would have some tax on it,"" he added. M&S said it was ""actively working to mitigate"" the effects of the ""rules of origin"" regulations, under which products are taxed differently depending on which country they come from. Other firms have also been hit by the confusion caused by new Brexit trading rules. Parcels giant DPD has suspended some services, while seafood exporter John Ross said the chaos was like being ""thrown in the cold Atlantic without a lifejacket"". Shane Brennan, chief executive of the Cold Chain Federation, which represents chilled transport and storage companies, said the emerging problems had come despite the amount of cross-border traffic still being quite low. ""Trade flows are still only about 50% of what we would expect, but even at those levels we are seeing levels of confusion and delays,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. ""The feeling is we are building to quite a significant potential disruption."" John Lewis scrapping overseas deliveries Were there hold-ups in first week after Brexit? Why are there empty shelves in some supermarkets? Covid tests for Channel hauliers to continue A government spokesman acknowledged that there had been ""some issues"", but said ministers had always been clear there would be some disruption at the end of the transition period. The Cabinet Office said in a statement that the volume of border crossings had been low so far this year, but that it expected crossings to steadily increase to normal levels. This brings the potential for ""significant disruption if traders and hauliers have not taken the necessary steps to comply with the new rules,"" the Cabinet Office said. Out of about 1,500 lorries per day trying to get from Great Britain to the EU in the new year, 700 have been turned away - mainly due to a lack of a negative Covid test for drivers, it said. ""We have always been clear there would be changes now that we are out of the customs union and single market, so full compliance with the new rules is vital to avoid disruption,"" said Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove. However, anger is growing among companies whose livelihoods depend on export trade. In a letter on Friday to Business Secretary Alok Sharma, Scottish salmon producer John Ross Jr launched a stinging attack on the government's handling of the situation. The firm's sales director, Victoria Leigh-Pearson, wrote that the company had in recent months ""had to endure the government issuing a barrage of useless information"" and an ""absence of factually correct information from all government agencies."" It amounted, she said, to ""gross incompetence"". John Ross exports to 36 countries and has won the Queen's Award twice Part of the letter to Alok Sharma: As I write, perishable goods that were dispatched from our facility five days ago, headed for France following a process that your department advised, have still not crossed the border. This usually takes only 24 hours because they are consolidated with the produce of other companies, which have not been able to follow the correct procedures due to a knowledge gap directly attributable to your department. Entire trucks are currently being rejected without explanation by the French customs authority. Our hauliers have now pulled their services as such a backlog has been created. Other hauliers are not taking on new customers. Today, we've even had confirmation that the IT systems of the UK and France are incompatible. After four years you only establish this now? Your so-called 'deal' is worthless if this situation is not fixed immediately, and unless you put in place measures to address the issues that continue to unfold on a daily basis. Moreover, as a seafood exporter, it feels as though our own government has thrown us into the cold Atlantic waters without a lifejacket. Yours sincerely, Victoria Leigh-Pearson, Sales Director, John Ross John Ross is not the only Scottish seafood exporter suffering. The industry says it has been hit by a ""perfect storm"" of Brexit disruption, which could sink a centuries-old industry. ""These businesses are not transporting toilet rolls or widgets. They are exporting the highest quality, perishable seafood which has a finite window to get to markets in peak condition,"" said Donna Fordyce, chief executive of Seafood Scotland. ""If the window closes, these consignments go to landfill."" She said the sector has already been weakened by Covid-19, the closure of the French border before Christmas as well as ""layer upon layer"" of problems associated with Brexit. The group fears that without exports, the fishing fleet will have little reason to go out. ""In a very short time, we could see the destruction of a centuries-old market which contributes significantly to the Scottish economy,"" added Ms Fordyce. UK government Minister for Scotland David Duguid blamed Scottish leaders for the issues. ""The Scottish Government has persistently refused to accept the democratic vote to leave the EU, but that does not allow them to abdicate their responsibilities to Scottish businesses,"" he said. ""Over the past 18 months they have assured the fishing industry that the systems they were putting in place would be adequate. They clearly are not."" Parcel delivery service DPD UK said it had paused its European Road Service because of the '""increased burden"" of customs paperwork for packages heading to the EU, including the Republic of Ireland. DPD said 20% of parcels had ""incorrect or incomplete data attached"", which meant they would have to be returned. This video can not be played What Brexit means for Britons travelling, shopping, studying or owning properties in the EU. In an email to its business customers, the company said that it had been a ""challenging few days"" for its international operation, and that it would ""pause and review"" its service.  It plans to restart on 13 January. ""It has now become evident that we have an increased burden with the new, more complex processes, and additional customs data we require from you for your parcels destined to Europe"" the firm wrote. The boss of one of Wales' largest hauliers said logistical problems have emerged at the Irish border too. Andrew Kinsella, managing director of Gwynedd Shipping, said his company has a backlog of 60 lorries waiting to be shipped to Dublin. He said many hauliers are finding that their customers are not able to generate the special declarations that are needed to ultimately enable a lorry to get onto a ferry. ""Whilst you don't see queues at ports and terminals the reality is that these queues are developing elsewhere in our depot in Holyhead, in our depot in Deeside and in our depot in Newport in South Wales, and lots of hauliers have depots in the proximity of ports,"" he said. ""There are a lot of issues about demarcation about who is going to arrange the export declaration with the UK revenue authorities, who's going to arrange the import declaration, the hauliers then trying to arrange the import safety and security declaration to create an ENS number which helps you generate a PBN number so there has been a lot of everyone finding their feet"".

Google suspends 'free speech' app Parler,"Google has suspended ""free speech"" social network Parler from its Play Store over its failure to remove ""egregious content"". Parler styles itself as ""unbiased"" social media and has proved popular with people banned from Twitter. But Google said the app had failed to remove posts inciting violence. Apple has also warned Parler it will remove the app from its App Store if it does not comply with its content-moderation requirements. On Parler, the app's chief executive John Matze said: ""We won't cave to politically motivated companies and those authoritarians who hate free speech!"" Launched in 2018, Parler has proved particularly popular among supporters of US President Donald Trump and right-wing conservatives. Such groups have frequently accused Twitter and Facebook of unfairly censoring their views. While Mr Trump himself is not a user, the platform already features several high-profile contributors following earlier bursts of growth in 2020. Texas Senator Ted Cruz boasts 4.9 million followers on the platform, while Fox News host Sean Hannity has about seven million. It briefly became the most-downloaded app in the United States after the US election, following a clampdown on the spread of election misinformation by Twitter and Facebook. However, both Apple and Google have said the app fails to comply with content-moderation requirements. By Shayan Sardarizadeh, BBC Monitoring For months, Parler has been one of the most popular social media platforms for right-wing users. As major platforms began taking action against viral conspiracy theories, disinformation and the harassment of election workers and officials in the aftermath of the US presidential vote, the app became more popular with elements of the fringe far-right. This turned the network into a right-wing echo chamber, almost entirely populated by users fixated on revealing examples of election fraud and posting messages in support of attempts to overturn the election outcome. In the days preceding the Capitol riots, the tone of discussion on the app became significantly more violent, with some users openly discussing ways to stop the certification of Joe Biden's victory by Congress. Unsubstantiated allegations and defamatory claims against a number of senior US figures such as Chief Justice John Roberts and Vice-President Mike Pence were rife on the app. Google and Apple say they are taking necessary action to ensure violent rhetoric is not promoted on their platforms. However, to those increasingly concerned about freedom of speech and expression on online platforms, it represents another example of draconian action by major tech companies which threatens internet freedom. This is a debate which is certain to continue beyond the Trump presidency. In a statement, Google confirmed it had suspended Parler from its Play Store, saying: ""Our longstanding policies require that apps displaying user-generated content have moderation policies and enforcement that removes egregious content like posts that incite violence. ""In light of this ongoing and urgent public safety threat, we are suspending the app's listings from the Play Store until it addresses these issues."" Apple has warned Parler it will be removed from the App Store on Saturday,externalin a letter published by Buzzfeed News. It said it had seen ""accusations that the Parler app was used to plan, coordinate, and facilitate"" the attacks on the US Capitol on 6 January. Mr Matze said Parler had ""no way to organise anything"" and pointed out that Facebook groups and events had been used to organise action. But Apple said: ""Our investigation has found that Parler is not effectively moderating and removing content that encourages illegal activity and poses a serious risk to the health and safety of users in direct violation of your own terms of service."" ""We won't distribute apps that present dangerous and harmful content."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In a related development, Google has kicked Steve Bannon's War Room podcast off YouTube, saying it had repeatedly violated the platform's rules. The ex-White House aide's channel had more than 300,000 subscribers. Steve Bannon served as President Trump's chief strategist for eight months in 2017 ""In accordance with our strikes system, we have terminated Steve Bannon's channel 'War room' and one associated channel for repeatedly violating our Community Guidelines,"" Google said in a statement. ""Any channel posting new videos with misleading content that alleges widespread fraud or errors changed the outcome of the 2020 US Presidential election in violation of our policies will receive a strike, a penalty which temporarily restricts uploading or live-streaming. Channels that receive three strikes in the same 90-day period will be permanently removed from YouTube."" The action was taken shortly after the channel posted an interview with Donald Trump's personal lawyer Rudy Giuliani, in which he blamed the Democrats for the rioting on Capitol Hill on Wednesday. One anti-misinformation group said the action was long overdue after ""months of Steve Bannon calling for revolution and violence"". ""The truth is YouTube should have taken down Steve Bannon's account a long time ago and they shouldn't rely on the labour of extremism researchers to moderate the content on their platform,"" said Madeline Peltz, Senior Researcher at Media Matters for America.

"'Act like you've got' the virus, government urges","People in England are being told to act like they have got Covid as part of a government advertising campaign aimed at tackling the rise in infections. Boris Johnson said the public should ""stay at home"" and not get complacent. On Friday1,325 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test were recorded in the UK- the highest daily figure yet - along with 68,053 new cases. Government sources say there is likely to be more focus from police on enforcing rather than explaining rules. ""With over 1,000 people dying yesterday it's more important than ever everyone sticks to rules,"" a source told the BBC.

""When you look at the data, it shows that almost 90% of people are overwhelmingly adhering to the rules despite the fact that we're also seeing more people out and about,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. However, she said in comparison to the first lockdown last spring the restrictions were less strict, with more people allowed to go out to work and children's nurseries open, meaning public transport is busier. The number of people travelling by public transport in London has decreased since the latest national lockdown began, with tube journeys now at 18% pre-pandemic demand and bus journeys at 30%, according to figures from Transport for London. However, during the first lockdown passenger numbers fell below 10% at some points. Prof Michie added that the winter season posed extra challenges because the virus survives longer in the cold and people spend more time indoors, where the virus can spread more easily. Combined with the more transmissible new variant, she said ""we should have a stricter rather than less strict lockdown than we had back in March"". Dr Adam Kucharski, another scientist advising the government and an associate professor of infectious disease epidemiology at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine, said that because the new variant was more transmissible ""each interaction we have has become riskier than it was before"".

"Covid 'out of control in London', Sadiq Khan saysThe mayor says in some parts of London 1 in 20 people has Covid-19, as he declares a ""major incident"".London","This video can not be played London mayor Sadiq Khan: ""Unless the virus reduces... we could run out of beds"" The spread of Covid in London is ""out of control"" according to Sadiq Khan, who has declared a ""major incident"". The coronavirus infection rate in London has exceeded 1,000 per 100,000 people, based on the latest figures from Public Health England. However, the Office for National Statistics recently estimatedas many as one in 30 Londoners,externalhas coronavirus. Mr Khan told BBC political reporter Karl Mercer that the figure is as high as one in 20 in some parts of London. Major incidents have previously been called for the Grenfell Tower fire in June 2017 and the terror attacks at Westminster Bridge and London Bridge. A major incident is any emergency that requires the implementation of special arrangements by one or all of the emergency services, the NHS or the local authority. It means the emergency services and hospitals cannot guarantee their normal level of response. Currently, there are more than 7,000 people in hospital with Covid-19, the mayor said. This is a 35% increase compared to last April's peak of the pandemic, he added. Dr Samantha Batt-Rawden, an ICU registrar and President of the Doctors' Association UK, tweeted: ""We tried. We really tried. NHS staff pleaded with people that Christmas is not worth it. Now one in 30 people in London have Covid and ICUs are overwhelmed. My heart is broken."" An analysis of Public Health England figures show in the week to 3 January, the number of cases rose across all of the London's boroughs compared with the previous week, with 17 individually recording more than 1,000 cases per 100,000 people. Testing increased in parts of the city after a drop over the Christmas period but positivity was high among people taking lab-based tests - suggesting more testing is needed to find undiagnosed cases in the community. In the past week, many parts of the capital saw a rise in deaths where a person had tested positive for coronavirus in the previous 28 days - with some areas recording more than double the number of deaths compared with the previous week. However, reporting over the Christmas period may have affected this. Out of the 18 acute hospital trusts in London providing figures to the government, all of them recorded having more beds being filled by coronavirus patients than in the previous week. Barts NHS Health, one of London's largest trusts, saw a 30% increase in coronavirus patients between 29 December and 5 January, to 830. The London Ambulance Service is now taking up to 8,000 emergency calls a day, the mayor says The mayor of London's announcement comes after the counties ofSussex and Surrey declared similar major incidentson Thursday. He said the London Ambulance Service was currently taking up to 8,000 emergency calls a day, compared to 5,500 on a typical busy day. The London Fire Brigade said more than 100 firefighters had been drafted in to drive ambulances to help cope with the demand. Every frontline agency involved in protecting the public has a legal duty to prepare for emergencies by devising and testing major incident plans. These public bodies declare a major incident when the situation they're confronting is so big or terrible that it's not only likely to cause serious harm, but it will also compromise their ability to respond effectively. In general terms, that means public bodies can legally stop delivering some everyday services, so that their personnel, attention and resources can be diverted to the emergency confronting them. At other times, the plans will lead to the military sending soldiers to aid the civilian effort, as we have seen already during the pandemic. Previous major incidents include the Grenfell Tower disaster in London, the Salisbury Novichok poisonings and the 2017 terrorism attacks. London's regional director for Public Health England Kevin Fenton said the current wave of coronavirus was ""the biggest threat"" the capital has faced in this pandemic to date. Prof Fenton urged Londoners to ""cut contacts"" and ""reduce movements"". He added: ""The emergence of the new variant means we are setting record case rates at almost double the national average, with at least one in 30 people now thought to be carrying the virus. ""We know this will sadly lead to large numbers of deaths, so strong and immediate action is needed."" This video can not be played What does it mean if the NHS is overwhelmed? Mr Khan is warning that London is ""at crisis point"". ""If we do not take immediate action now, our NHS could be overwhelmed and more people will die,"" he said. ""Londoners continue to make huge sacrifices and I am today imploring them to please stay at home unless it is absolutely necessary for you to leave. Stay at home to protect yourself, your family, friends and other Londoners and to protect our NHS."" He said he had written to Prime Minister Boris Johnson asking for more financial support for Londoners who need to self-isolate and are unable to work, and for daily vaccination data. Mr Khan also called for the closure of places of worship and for face masks to be worn routinely outside the home, including in crowded places and supermarket queues, in a bid to curb case numbers. BBC London political correspondent Karl Mercer Two hospital trusts in London have recorded more than 1,000 coronavirus deaths The mayor of London was in a sombre mood when I spoke to him earlier this afternoon. One in 20 Londoners in some areas now has Covid, and there is a real fear that hospitals will simply be overwhelmed in the next two weeks. Declaring a major incident is a real indication of the levels of concern felt not just at City Hall but across London's emergency services and the NHS. More Londoners are now in hospital with coronavirus than at the peak of the first wave last April - and those numbers are growing by more than 800 every day. It's believed the last mayor to declare a London-wide major incident was Boris Johnson in response to the 2011 riots. The coming days will be some of the most challenging in the city's recent history. Katie Sanderson, a junior doctor working in London, said she is worried how long medical staff can cope with the surge of patients. ""[Staff] are working on wards and spending long amounts of time with patients who need high-intensive oxygen therapy,"" she said. ""It is technically challenging and the emotional burden is enormous. I see it in a flatness in their demeanour, like we've all got used to doing things which before were totally inconceivable."" Georgia Gould, chair of London Councils, described London's rising coronavirus rate as ""dangerous"". She added: ""One in 30 Londoners now has Covid. This is why public services across London are urging all Londoners to please stay at home except for absolutely essential shopping and exercise. ""This is a dark and difficult time for our city but there is light at end of the tunnel with the vaccine rollout. We are asking Londoners to come together one last time to stop the spread - lives really do depend on it."" Hunt for vaccine fraudster who injected woman, 92 Everything you need to know about the Covid vaccine in the UK What has coronavirus done to TfL's finances? Earlier this week as the prime minister introduced an England-wide lockdown, the Met Police said officers were going to be""more inquisitive"" towards Londoners seen outside. The Met handed out 1,761 fines for breaches of coronavirus laws between 27 March and 20 December. Deputy Assistant Commissioner Matt Twist said the major incident was a ""stark reminder"" of the point London is at in the pandemic. He said: ""These rule-breakers cannot continue to feign ignorance of the risk that this virus poses or listen to the false information and lies that some promote downplaying the dangers. ""Every time the virus spreads it increases the risk of someone needlessly losing their life."" This video can not be played 'One of the worst shifts of my life - it's overwhelming' In response to Mr Khan's announcement the government said the NHS is continuing to ""face a huge challenge"" A spokeswoman added: ""It is absolutely paramount people in London, and the rest of the country, follow the rules and stay at home to protect the NHS and save lives. ""We are working closely with NHS England to support hospitals in the capital, including additional bed capacity at the London Nightingale. ""Financial support is in place for workers who need to self-isolate - including a Â£500 payment for those on the lowest incomes who have been contacted by NHS Test and Trace.""

"Kim vows to expand North Korea's nuclear arsenalKim Jong-un calls the US his ""biggest enemy"" while plans for a nuclear submarine are nearly complete.Asia","North Korean leader Kim Jong-un said US policy towards his country would ""never change"" North Korean leader Kim Jong-un has said the US is his country's ""biggest enemy"" and that he does not expect Washington to change its policy toward Pyongyang - whoever is president. Addressing a rare congress of his ruling Workers' Party, Mr Kim also pledged to expand North Korea's nuclear weapons arsenal and military potential. He said that plans for a nuclear submarine were almost complete. His comments come as US President-elect Joe Biden prepares to take office. Analysts suggest Mr Kim's remarks are an effort to apply pressure on the incoming government, with Mr Biden set to be sworn in on 20 January. Mr Kim enjoyed a warm rapport with outgoing US President Donald Trump, even if little concrete progress was made on negotiations over North Korea's nuclear programme. North Korea's missile and nuclear programme Watch: North Korea hosts military spectacle What does North Korea want? This video can not be played North Korea's Kim Jong-un chokes up during speech In his latest address to the Workers' Party - only the eighth congress in its history - Mr Kim said Pyongyang did not intend to use its nuclear weapons unless ""hostile forces"" were planning to use them against North Korea first. He said the US was his country's ""biggest obstacle for our revolution and our biggest enemy... no matter who is in power, the true nature of its policy against North Korea will never change,"" state news agency KCNA reported. His speech outlined a list of desired weapons including long-range ballistic missiles capable of being launched from land or sea and ""super-large warheads"". North Korea has managed to significantly advance its arsenal despite being subject to strict economic sanctions. Earlier this week, Mr Kim admitted that hisfive-year economic plan for the isolated country failed to meet its targetsin ""almost every sector"". North Korea closed its borders last January to prevent Covid from entering the country. Its authorities say the country has not had a single Covid case since the pandemic began butexperts say this is highly unlikelydue to North Korea's cross-border trade with China. Trade with China has plummeted by about 80%. Typhoons and floods have devastated homes and crops in North Korea, which remains under strict international sanctions, including over its nuclear programme. The speech is likely to be Mr Kim's way of setting the stage for talks with President-elect Joe Biden who will take office in less than two weeks' time. The aim is perhaps to put pressure on Washington to show that Pyongyang has no intention of being cowed by sanctions and will continue to expand its nuclear arsenal. Mr Kim had three summits with Donald Trump - but they failed to reach a deal. However, North Korea is in a difficult and bleak economic position caused by strict sanctions, border blockades to prevent the spread of Covid-19 and devastating floods. This message may seem threatening, but some analysts believe that there is still room for diplomacy.

"'Act like you've got' the virus, government warns","People in England are being told to act like they have got Covid as part of a government advertising campaign aimed at tackling the rise in infections. Boris Johnson said the public should ""stay at home"" and not get complacent. On Friday1,325 deaths within 28 days of a positive Covid test were recorded in the UK- the highest daily figure yet - along with 68,053 new cases. Government sources say there is likely to be more focus from police on enforcing rather than explaining rules. ""With over 1,000 people dying yesterday it's more important than ever everyone sticks to rules,"" a source told the BBC.
