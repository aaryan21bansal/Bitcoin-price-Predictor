Johnson accused of 'misunderstanding' Brexit deal,"This video can not be played ""There will not be checks on goods going from NI to GB,"" Boris Johnson tells Conservative supporters Boris Johnson has been accused of not understanding his Brexit deal or what it means for businesses in Northern Ireland. Labour criticised him after he briefed Conservative members on Thursday. The prime minister said companies could ""bin"" customs forms because there would be ""no barriers of any kind"" to trade crossing the Irish Sea. But that contradicts what Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay said last month about customs declarations for goods. Mr Barclay saidbusinesses in Northern Ireland would have to submit customs declaration formsafter he initially denied that was the case. Did PM get Brexit deal details right? Johnson a 'passionate unionist' On Friday, Labour's Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer tweeted that Mr Johnson's remarks to Conservative Party members in Northern Ireland suggested he ""either doesn't understand the deal he has negotiated or he isn't telling the truth"".

In a video of the meeting, which has appeared on social media, businessman Irwin Armstrong asked Mr Johnson if he could tell his staff ""we will not be filling in any customs declarations for good leaving Northern Ireland to go to GB"". Mr Johnson replied: ""You can."" He added: ""If somebody asks you to do that tell them to ring up the prime minister and I will direct them to throw that form in the bin. ""There will be no forms, no checks, no barriers of any kind - you will have unfettered access."" On Friday, broadcasters questioned Mr Johnson about his remarks. He told reporters: ""Northern Ireland and the rest of GB are part of the UK customs territory and there can be no checks between goods operating in one customs territory. ""We're the UK - we will not be instituting such checks."" Analysis: Jonathan Blake, BBC News political correspondent Boris Johnson may have been trying to keep the focus of this campaign on his deceptively simple slogan of ""get Brexit done"" but three days in he's already found himself bogged down in the detail of his deal. His words to Tory supporters in Northern Ireland on Thursday were an attempt to allay fears that businesses there would be subject to extra paperwork when shipping goods to the rest of the UK. But with little detail - and confusing messages from ministers about how that aspect of his Brexit deal will work - the picture is unclear. The prime minister will continue to present it as an agreement that is ready to go if he wins a majority at next month's general election. Mr Armstrong, who said his company makes small shipments to pharmacies in the rest of the UK, was not sure Mr Johnson was being ""absolutely serious in his answer"". The businessman told the PA Media news agency: ""I want to believe him but is he just being bombastic and being Boris? ""I don't know Boris Johnson well enough, whether it's just what you say on a campaign trail or whether he is absolutely serious."" This video can not be played 'The Brexit minister didn't really know the answer' At the same event on Thursday night, Mr Johnson also told Conservative members Northern Ireland had ""got a great deal"". He added: ""You keep free movement, you keep access to the single market but you also have, as it says in the deal, unfettered access to GB."" Analysis: Chris Page, BBC News Ireland correspondent Trade experts say they believe there will need to be checks on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland - even if they are not destined to cross the Irish border. That is because under the Brexit deal Northern Ireland will have to follow some of the rules of the European single market - on food produce, for example. There are strict regulations on ""products of animal origin"", which must enter the EU through a border inspection post where goods are frequently checked. These issues may be very technical but in the context of Brexit and the election they are also highly political - and not just in Northern Ireland, where they are going to matter the most in practical terms. BBC News NI's economics and business editor John Campbell saidit was ""not completely clear"" what Mr Johnson meantby ""free movement"" in that context. ""Free movement gives all citizens of EU countries the right to travel, live and work wherever they wish within the EU,"" he added. ""The government has promised to end free movement and this will also apply in Northern Ireland. ""It seems that Mr Johnson was referring to the continuation of the Common Travel Area, which allows passport-free travel between the UK and Ireland and gives British and Irish citizens a range of rights in each other's countries."" The Liberal Democrats criticised the prime minister after the comments for wanting to treat Northern Ireland differently to the rest of the UK. The party's Brexit spokesman Tom Brake told PA Media: ""The single market and freedom of movement are a great deal - even Boris Johnson recognises this. ""So why isn't he keeping them for the whole of the UK as part of the many benefits of EU membership? ""It is clear that the best deal for the UK is the one we have now - in the EU,"" he said.

"Labour promising 1,000 new children's centres","Both Labour and the Lib Dems have pledged extra money to support the parents of young children. Labour vowed to spend Â£1bn on opening 1,000 new early years centres in England, saying they would get parents back to work and help children achieve. The Lib Dems are promising working families subsidised care for children from the age of nine months. Lib Dem education spokesperson Layla Moran said the Â£14.6bn policy was ""an investment in the country's future"". The Conservatives say they are already ""investing record amounts in high-quality childcare"". Childcare providers have expressed scepticism at the lack of funding details and warned of an ""electoral arms race"" on childcare promises. Children's centre closures 'as high as 1,000' Sure Start 'big benefits' but face closure Your 30-hour free childcare questions On a visit to Leeds with shadow Labour education secretary Angela Rayner, Mr Corbyn will promise to open a new generation of Sure Start centres, which provide health, welfare and education services for pre-school children. Ms Rayner said she was proud of the policy, since she went to a Sure Start centre when she had her son at the age of 16 that she said taught her to ""love and nurture and read to my child"". ""My mum couldn't read or write and didn't know that cuddling and giving love to your child is really important,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""Sure Start really changed the life chances for my children and I'll be forever grateful for that."" Labour's Angela Rayner said she benefitted from a Sure Start centre Asked whether all parents, regardless of income, should be offered help from Sure Start centres, she said they were about more than a household's financial situation. ""I'm talking about not having the basic understanding of how to nurture a young child and any parent can be put in that situation."" She said the UK could afford to invest more in support for young children. ""We can't afford not to do it because we know that anything we try to do after the early years is playing catch up,"" she said. Giving parents more free childcare would help them back to work and support the economy, she added. According to a report from the Sutton Trust last year, up to 1,000 Sure Start centres have closed in the past decade, with funding pressures being blamed. Labour says it will ""reverse the cuts"" in the centres which were originally launched when Tony Blair was prime minister. An analysis from the Institute of Fiscal Studies earlier this year said Sure Start had made a positive impact, with evidence that the health advice had ""significantly reduced"" the numbers of children being admitted to hospital. But the financial think tank said it had been a story of a ""fast roll-out followed by deep spending cuts"", with spending peaking at Â£1.8bn in 2010 and then being cut to Â£600m by 2017-18. The IFS puts the number of closures at about 500 sites - half the Sutton Trust estimate. Labour has also restated its commitment to providing 30 hours-a-week of childcare for all two-to-four-year-olds, as part of its overall Â£4.5bn childcare package. Mr Corbyn said opening a Sure Start centre in ""every community"" would ""unlock the potential of every child"". He said: ""Parents are struggling to afford the childcare support they need, while many children are going hungry and growing up homeless."" The Liberal Democrats are unveiling their own childcare plans - offering 35 hours a week of care for all parents of two-to-four-year-olds. This would be available for working parents from when their children are nine months old. The Lib Dems say this will be funded by ""fair tax changes"", which they say means ""making sure that big businesses pay their share"". The party's education spokesperson said investing in childcare was ""an investment in the country's future"". ""It doesn't just help in terms of high early years provision making school children school ready, but also in closing that gender pay gap, which is incredibly important."" Ms Moran told the Today programme the total cost of the policy was Â£14.6bn, which was ""fully costed"" as part of her party's manifesto. ""It's going to be an expensive policy we've been very upfront about that,"" she said. ""The true cost to child care providers of doing this is more than has been provided."" Layla Moran said providing extra funding for childcare was ""an investment in the country's future"" At present working parents of three- and four-year-olds in England are entitled to 30 hours' free childcare a week - and the Conservatives say they have increased the funding and quality of childcare provision while in government. Neil Leitch, chief executive of the Early Years Alliance, welcomed Labour's promise for new Sure Start centres. But he raised concerns about funding the promises - and whether there would be adequate levels of payments for nurseries and childcare providers. ""This is a positive policy for the thousands of parents struggling to afford childcare - but the lack of detail on how it will be funded will strike fear into the hearts of many providers. ""We currently have a funding shortfall in the early years of two-thirds of a billion pounds. That shortfall, which has led to thousands of provider closures, is a direct result of an ongoing electoral arms race between political parties to entice parents with 'free childcare' without thinking through how it will be paid for. ""It has meant that very few parents receive truly 'free' childcare and has ultimately pushed up prices for non-funded hours."" A really simple guide What's the price tag on an election?

Teen who murdered ex in 'frenzied' attack jailed,"The court heard Ellie Gould was a keen horse rider who talked of joining the mounted police A teenager stabbed his ex-girlfriend repeatedly in the neck in a ""frenzied attack"" before trying to make it appear her wounds were self-inflicted. Thomas Griffiths admitted murdering Ellie Gould, 17, at her home in Calne, Wiltshire, in May, after she ended their relationship. Griffiths, now aged 18, went to the schoolgirl's home, killed her and then left her hand on the knife handle. He was jailed for a minimum of 12 and a half years at Bristol Crown Court. Carole Gould said there was nothing in Griffiths' behaviour before her daughter's death that ""would ring alarm bells"". ""We welcomed him into our home. We ate dinner with him,"" she said. Ellie Gould's killer 'should never be released' The packed courtroom heard the night before Griffiths murdered her, Ellie had told friends they had broken up and he had ""not taken it well"". The pair were A-level students at Hardenhuish School in Chippenham, had known each other since Year 7, and been in a relationship for three months. Thomas Griffiths was 17 when he killed Ellie in her family home Griffiths walked out of school on the morning of 3 May and drove to Ellie's home in Springfield Drive. There he attempted to strangle her, before stabbing her 13 times in the neck with a knife taken from the kitchen. ""Griffiths became angry, perhaps by Ellie's continued rejection of him, and he attacked her,"" prosecutor Richard Smith QC said. A statement was read out in court from Ellie's father, Matt Gould, who found her lying on the kitchen floor with the knife still in her neck. He said it was ""the most frightening, horrific and saddest scene I have ever experienced"" and it ""fills my thoughts all day"". This video can not be played Carole Gould: 'I'll never forget that phone call' Evidence suggested Griffiths had put Ellie's hand on the weapon to make it look like she had done it to herself. The court heard Griffiths spent an hour at the house before he drove home, changed his clothes and dumped a bag of items taken from Ellie's house in a wood. Later that day he sent a series of ""fake"" messages to friends and to Ellie's mobile phone asking if she wanted to meet. Griffiths also told friend marks on his neck were caused by self-harm but the court heard they most likely caused by his ""young victim fighting for her life"". Ellie Gould told friends Griffiths had ""not taken their break-up well"" Sentencing him, Judge Mr Justice Garnham told Griffiths his actions had been a ""frenzied knife attack"" and ""the most appalling act"" on a ""vulnerable young woman in her own home where she should have been safe"". He said Ellie had ""tried desperately to fight back, scratching frantically at your neck"" and ""most chilling is that you left her on the kitchen floor with the knife still in her neck and with her left hand on the knife"". The judge told Griffiths it was one of several steps he had taken to ""cover your tracks"". ""There can be no more dreadful scene for any parent to contemplate than that which confronted Ellie's father when he came home that day from work,"" Mr Justice Garnham said. The court had previously heard Ellie was a keen horse rider who competed in local shows and cross-country events, and talked of joining the mounted police. The judge told Griffiths: ""The effects of your actions have not only snuffed out the life of this talented girl... but loaded pain on her friends and family."" The court was told thatfollowing his guilty plea in August, Griffiths, of Derry Hill, Wiltshire, had written a letter outlining his ""heartfelt remorse"". In it, he said: ""IÂ feel confused and angry at myself that I was able to hurt someone so special to me."" Ellie's body was found at a house in Springfield Drive, Calne Det Ch Insp Jim Taylor of Wiltshire Police said Griffiths ended Ellie's life ""in the cruellest way imaginable"" and ""destroyed the lives of those who were close to her"". ""While I know that this prison sentence will not bring Ellie back, and 12 and a half years no doubt seems insignificant given the severity of this crime and the colossal loss for this family, I hope that in some way it provides them with some form of closure,"" he added.

Sturgeon lists SNP's conditions for backing Labour,"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: 'Future of the country is at stake' Nicola Sturgeon has set out a list of demands she would make in return for backing a minority Labour government to keep Boris Johnson out of Number 10. Ms Sturgeon made clear that Labour would need to back the ""principle"" of a second independence referendum. The first minister said she would also seek greater powers for the Scottish Parliament, and an end to austerity. But the SNP leader insisted she would not form a formal coalition with Labour if there is a hung parliament. Instead, she said her party would potentially be willing to back a minority Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn on an issue-by-issue basis. The Conservatives said Ms Sturgeon's comments meant the UK could be facing referendums on both the EU and independence next year if Labour wins the election. And Labour said it was aiming to win the election and was therefore ""not in the business of talking about deals with other parties"". The latest from the general election trail Reality check: Nicola Sturgeon's SNP campaign speech SNP campaign launch: Scotland's remain party? Election 2019: Key questions facing Scotland's parties The SNP won 35 seats in the last general election in 2017, making it the third largest party in the House of Commons and leading to speculation that it could hold the balance of power if no one wins an outright majority in the election on 12 December. But Ms Sturgeon again warned that other parties ""need not bother picking up the phone"" to her after the election unless they are willing to support her party's right to hold an independence referendum next year. She said her party would drive a ""hard bargain"" with anyone seeking SNP support in the event of a hung parliament - and explicitly ruled out doing any deal with the Conservatives. Ms Sturgeon's list of demands for SNP support included the ""principle of the people of Scotland deciding our own future"", as well as the devolution of powers over immigration, employment and drug laws. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said during a visit to Scotland on Thursday that he would fight to ""keep our fantastic United Kingdom together and prevent another referendum next year"". The prime minister has ruled out supporting Ms Sturgeon's plan for another independence referendum The Liberal Democrats are also firmly opposed to another independence referendum - while Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said indyref2 is neither ""desirable or necessary"" and has indicated he would not support one in the ""formative years"" of a Labour government. Speaking tothe BBC's Laura Kuenssbergafter the launch of her party's election campaign, Ms Sturgeon said that the SNP holding the balance of power after the election would put Scotland in an ""incredibly influential position"". She stressed that she would ""never put Boris Johnson in power"" and claimed that people had ""good reason"" to be concerned about the prospect of Mr Corbyn becoming prime minister. But she insisted it would be better to have SNP MPs ""in there making sure the right issues are progressed and the right values upheld"". The SNP leader had earlier said the vote on 12 December would be the ""most important in our lifetime"", and said the outcome would determine the future of the country for ""generations to come"". Ms Sturgeon said Scotland had been on a ""journey"" in the two decades since the creation of the devolved Scottish Parliament. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon is asked whether she'd be willing to form an alliance with Jeremy Corbyn But she claimed that ""many of the gains of the last 20 years and the promise of a better future"" were now under threat from what she described as ""hardline Brexit ultras"" within the Conservative Party. Ms Sturgeon said: ""Scotland's vote to remain in the EU has been ignored. ""The Conservative Party has ridden roughshod over the Scottish Parliament. For the first time ever the UK government has chosen to legislate on devolved matters without the consent of Holyrood. ""With so-called 'moderate' Conservatives in full retreat and the hard-line Brexit ultras on the march, that is surely only a taste of what is to come."" Ms Sturgeon addressed a pro-independence rally in Glasgow at the weekend Ms Sturgeon said a vote for the SNP was therefore a vote to ""escape Brexit"" and to ""take Scotland's future out of the hands of Boris Johnson and a broken Westminster system"". And she said the SNP already had ""a cast iron mandate"" for another independence referendum and warned the prime minister that he has ""no right to block the democratic wishes of the people of Scotland"". Ms Sturgeon also unveiled plans for the SNP to launch a bill at Westminster aimed at protecting the NHS across the UK from privatisation and future trade deals. The NHS Protection Bill would block any UK government from using the NHS as a ""bargaining chip"" in trade talks. Election 2019: Could the NHS be 'up for sale'? Could US companies run NHS services after Brexit? If passed it would also give devolved parliaments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland a veto on any deal, she said. Ms Sturgeon claims that despite health policy being devolved to the Scottish Parliament, the UK government could still ""sell off"" the NHS in trade negotiations. The UK government has insisted the NHS is ""not on the table"" for trade talks and is not in any way ""up for sale"", pledging to bring forward the ""biggest programme of NHS investment in a generation"" if the Conservatives win the election. Nicola Sturgeon does not rule out a deal with Mr Corbyn, or Labour, in the event of a hung Parliament. She has a shopping list which seems to grow by the day - from anti-austerity economics through the enhanced devolution of benefits through action on climate change. But top of that list is a further referendum on independence. Might Mr Corbyn be persuaded to adopt that? He won't say yes or no. It isn't a priority, we are told. No deal, no pact. Labour would govern as a minority and challenge others to cast their votes on individual issues. But then successive members of Team Corbyn cloud the issue once more by hinting it might arise a bit down the road. Would Ms Sturgeon be willing to wait? Perhaps - although she insisted at the launch that the timetable should be determined by the Scottish Parliament, not at Westminster. This potential accommodation, of course, does not operate in a vacuum. Particularly in Scotland, each of the other parties is advancing a case with regard to these twin issues of Brexit and independence. Read more on Brian Taylor's blog - SNP launch: Scotland's remain party? Michael Gove of the Conservatives said Ms Sturgeon had dropped a ""bombshell"" onto the election campaign by again saying she would seek a fresh independence referendum as a price for supporting Mr Corbyn in government. Mr Gove said: ""That would mean there would be two referendums next year - one on Europe, and one on Scotland's independence. It's the last thing this country needs. ""We need to get Brexit done and get on with the people's priorities, but the SNP and Labour instead want more misery as two referendums consume all the air in our political system."" The Shadow Brexit Secretary, Keir Starmer, said Labour would not be doing deals with anyone when asked about the party's position on a second independence referendum in Scotland. Speaking on the campaign trail in Wales, Mr Starmer said: ""The Labour party is in this election for real change and we're in it to win it, and therefore we're not in the business of talking about deals with other parties."" Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said her party would be willing to work with other parties at Westminster, but cautioned: ""When it comes to the SNP, they need to drop their obsession with independence because we've just had three years of Brexit chaos that's hurting our country, that's hurting our public services."" ""We need to learn the lessons of Brexit not repeat the mistakes."" Do you have any other questions about elections in the UK?

Woman dies and dozens evacuated as floods hit,"This video can not be played Drone footage filmed from Matlock shows the extent of the floodwater A woman has died after becoming submerged in floodwater as parts of England were deluged with a month's worth of rain in a day. Her body was found hours after she was swept into Derbyshire's River Derwent. Elsewhere, people have been evacuated from their homes as rivers reached record levels in some areas. During a visit to the area, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""We need to prepare and we need to be investing in defences."" The Derwent is expected to peak in Derby city centre at 22:00 GMT, while police have ordered the closure of a main route into the city. The woman was reported to have been swept away by floodwater in Rowsley, near Matlock, in the early hours of Friday and the body was found about two miles away in Darley Dale. Flooding in Yorkshire: As it happened East Midlands flooding: As it happened Derbyshire Police said her family had been informed and formal identification was yet to take place. Mark Hopkinson, who witnessed the emergency operation to find the woman, said he saw police officers and mountain rescuers searching in the area. ""We saw a little drone go up and the coastguard helicopter came, and that was then circling, hovering over some trees,"" he said. There has been severe flooding in Darley Dale where the woman's body was found The heaviest rainfall on Thursday night was at Swineshaw in the Peak District, which had 112mm (4.4in) in 24 hours. Parts of Sheffield experienced 85mm - just 3mm (0.1in) less than the area's monthly average. More than 100 flood warnings are in place across England. In pictures: Rain floods parts of northern England How do you stop flooding? Dozens sleep at shopping centre amid floods The Environment Agency has issuedsix severe flood warnings,externalfor locations on the River Don. Fran Lowe, from the Environment Agency (EA), urged people to take them seriously ""as they represent a threat to life"". ""Respond immediately and get out of any place affected by a severe flood warning,"" he said. Boris Johnson visited Matlock where he met emergency workers The River Don, which flows through Sheffield, Rotherham and Doncaster, has hit its highest recorded level, at just over 6.3m, higher than it was in 2007 when it also flooded. South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service said in the past 28 hours crews rescued more than 120 people, with about 1,200 calls to its control room. In Doncaster: Residents in Yarborough Terrace, in the Bentley area, were rescued by boat as waist-high water filled the street More than 50 people were rescued from static homes at Willow Bridge Caravan Site since the river overtopped In Rotherham: People were told to stay at home and not leave unless asked to do so by the emergency services Firefighters used boats to rescue people who were stranded in the Parkgate shopping centre on Thursday night, with dozens spending the night at the town hall The EA said it was using high-volume pumps to move water away from homes in Catcliffe, one of the areas of greatest concern People were taken to safety in boats in Rotherham While visiting Matlock in Derbyshire, Boris Johnson thanked emergency workers and said he was impressed at how people ""had pulled together"". He said: ""It's businesses particularly who deserve our sympathies and they've had a really tough time. ""You cannot underestimate the psychological effect of flooding on people - it is a big, big blow. ""People have been moved out of their homes and probably hundreds of businesses have seen damage to their properties - we stand ready to help in any way that we can."" Some residents of Yarborough Terrace in Doncaster criticised the official response The town's mayor, Liberal Democrat David Hughes, said: ""Is this an election stunt or is the government concerned for the people of Matlock? ""It's very difficult to determine."" In Derby, flood defences were built on Exeter Bridge as the River Derwent continued to rise. The A52, the main route into the city from the M1 was one of several roads partly closed due to flooding and many bus services were suspended. It reached its highest-ever recorded level and is expected to peak at 22:00. Some premises in the city have been evacuated and Derby Theatre has cancelled performances for the night. This video can not be played Watch: Aerial views of Mansfield mudslide Elsewhere in the East Midlands: A ""major incident"" has been declared in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, after dozens of homes were evacuated Residents from 28 properties in Mansfield have been told it is still unsafe for them to return home after a mudslide on Thursday Every time there's serious flooding, questions are asked about why it was allowed to happen. One simple answer is governments of all parties have been accused of not spending enough on protection. You can build walls along river banks and many places have been guarded this way but such 'hard defences' are expensive and obtrusive. An alternative is to employ what are known as soft defences. These include encouraging farmers to manage their land in ways that let fields hold back floodwater. Driveways and car parks can be surfaced with materials that allow it to reach the soil underneath. Another option is to make homes more resilient - fitting exterior doors with waterproof plastic panels, sealing the ground floor and raising fuse boxes. In some ways the country has become better prepared for flooding but lessons are not always learned and the misery for many keeps being repeated.

Scotland's future slap bang in middle of campaign,"The SNP leader has made her conditions clear for supporting a minority Labour government This election is happening because of Brexit. For good or for ill, the Parliament of 2017 to 2019 failed to come to a conclusion. So the still new prime minister decided that the best way for him to achieve his desired departure from the EU was to go again to the country, disappointing Brenda from Bristol, and giving anxiety to the organisers of nativity plays, Christmas fairs, and carol singers - that's even before you start considering the implosion of political operatives looking for ways of running a campaign in the cold and dark of the winter months when, as today's floods are demonstrating, the weather can't be relied on to play ball for balmy summer evenings on the doorstep. Before the campaign is even a week old, however, it is squarely also about another massive constitutional issue - whether the UK stays as one, or Scotland has another chance to choose to go its own way. Without obsessing about the potential permutations of a hung Parliament, the polls suggest that neither of the main big tribes are on their way to a thumping majority. And that means at this stage, it is relevant to think about the what ifs, and the politicians certainly are. Sturgeon lists SNP's conditions for backing Labour At the SNP's campaign launch today it was striking how explicit First Minister Nicola Sturgeon was about how she might play a powerful hand if there is no overall clear winner on the morning of Friday 13th. Essentially, she has named her price. Even though she has previously branded Jeremy Corbyn ""pitifully ineffective"" and ""not credible as an alternative prime minister"", the SNP leader told us today that she would be willing to work with him on an ""issue by issue"" basis as long as he gave her an in-principle commitment to holding another referendum on Scottish independence. Importantly, Ms Sturgeon softened her previous insistence that this would have to happen immediately, suggesting that as long as a potential Corbyn government was willing to commit to letting it happen that would be enough. Previous Labour leaders have said no way, as plenty of Labour candidates still do. Senior figures like Keir Starmer and Emily Thornberry were quick to say after Ms Sturgeon's comments that there had been no deal, and there won't be. The 2014 referendum was meant to be a ""once in a generation"" (remember when politicians used to give those kind of promises?!) decision. But both Jeremy Corbyn and his right-hand man John McDonnell have given strong signals, that they would not stand in the way of the SNP pushing for another vote, just not in the first year of a potential Labour government. But we've seen today the two sides may be lining up to hypothetically make it happen if there is a hung Parliament. Ms Sturgeon is not insisting any more it would have to happen straight away and Mr Corbyn is not insisting that it could never happen. And so, while there are plenty of other issues in this election of course, it's clear one of the possible outcomes leads Scotland again to having the choice of leaving the UK. Boris Johnson is hoping talk of another vote in Scotland will drive unionist support to his party The Tories were already campaigning with claims that somehow the SNP and the Labour Party were in cahoots somehow. While that was denied, and there is even today nothing official about any arrangement, the First Minister's comments have done the Conservatives a big favour, especially in Scotland where unionist voters who do not like the Tories conceptually one bit, might yet be tempted to vote for them because they don't want another Scottish referendum. That was a big reason why, in 2017, the Tories surged (relatively!) to 13 seats, and it may help them hang on to more of their seats on the green benches this time round. And across the UK it gives the Tories more ammunition to back up their accusation that a vote for Jeremy Corbyn could mean more political uncertainty - another referendum on our membership of the EU, and possibly another vote on the UK too. Of course any of this only comes to pass in the event that neither the Tories nor the Labour Party can form a government on their own. But given the state of the polls, it's a potential scenario, and just as in 2015, the chatter about that potential situation is a factor in the campaign itself, and the SNP are determined to make it so too. Our messy national struggle over the EU has frustrated politicians and voters alike for three years now. And while some SNP members are wildly enthusiastic about it, there are plenty of people here too who think another referendum on independence would be a disaster. But in Scotland it's hard to talk about one, without talking about the other. Brexit is the reason for this election. But with no obvious route to a comfortable majority for either Boris Johnson or Jeremy Corbyn, the future shape of the whole UK is now slap bang in the middle of the campaign.

Reality check: Sturgeon's SNP campaign speech,"Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has launched the Scottish National Party's election campaign in Edinburgh. She made a few claims worth looking at - the first was about the potential impact of Brexit on Scotland. Talking about the prospect of the UK leaving the European Union's (EU) single market and customs union, she said: ""Economic analysis says that it will cost every person in Scotland Â£1,600"". The single market is the agreement between EU countries that provides for free movement of people, goods, services and capital, while also having the same regulations about things like food safety, transport and packaging. The customs union is an agreement to have no taxes charged on trade between EU countries, while charging the same taxes on things coming from outside the bloc. The figure came from aScottish government assessment,externalin January 2018 (before either Theresa May's or Boris Johnson's deals). It estimated that leaving the single market and customs union would mean Scotland's GDP (the value of the total output of the country) would be 6.1% lower by 2030 than it would have been if the UK had stayed in the EU. It predicted that would knock Â£9bn off Scottish output (in 2016 pounds), which it divided by the population of Scotland to get about Â£1,600 per person. So it's saying that GDP per person would be Â£1,600 lower than it would otherwise have been in 11 years, but that's not the same as costing each individual Â£1,600. GDP includes other things like company profits, some of which could go to shareholders outside Scotland. GDP per head does feed into average income, but it is not necessarily on a one-to-one basis. To be clear, almost all economic analysis predicts that, over this sort of time period, leaving the customs union and the single market would mean GDP would be lower than it would have been if the UK had stayed in the EU. But the Â£1,600 per person figure is unhelpful. You can read more about this from the BBC's Scotland economics editor Douglas Fraserhere. The first minister also said: ""We have the best performing accident and emergency services anywhere in the United Kingdom."" Health is a devolved power, and each nation expects 95% of patients to be treated or admitted in four hours. Nicola Sturgeon is right to say that performance against this target was better in Scotland than in the rest of the UK in 2018-19 - when 91.2% of patients were treated or admitted in that time - but Scotland still missed its target. The figure compares with 88% in England, 80% in Wales and 69.9% Northern Ireland. Scotland is also the most recent nation to have hit the target, which it achieved in the summer of 2017. You can read more about it inthis piece from last year. What claims do you want BBC Reality Check to investigate?

How do you stop flooding?,"Flood barriers like these along the River Severn have been put in place Storm Franklin has led to flooding and homes being evacuated in some parts of the UK. In areas at risk of flooding, several different techniques are used to try to reduce the threat to people and property. Storm Franklin hits UK with floods and high winds The Environment Agency uses a range of temporary flood barriers to provide protection in flood-prone areas. Lightweight metal barriers are relatively inexpensive, can be placed in various positions, and removed when waters recede. Frame barriers use the weight of the floodwater itself to hold them in place. Temporary barriers can also be added to permanent flood defences, such as raised embankments, increasing the level of protection. Glass barriers in use in Keswick, Cumbria Simple measures to reduce the flow of water before it reaches larger rivers are also used. They include the use of small barriers in ditches and fields, or notches cut into embankments, to divert the water into open land. Letting pools form outside the main channel of a river means water is temporarily removed from the main flow - reducing the power of the floodwaters. Natural flood management offers a sustainable approach to managing floods and is intended to complement flood barriers and concrete walls. Trees can also help defend against floods.Planting more trees catches rainfall and helps take water from the soil - although the Environment Agency says large areas must be reforested to make a real difference. Felled trees can also be laid across streams in wooded areas and help push unusually high waters into surrounding woodlands. Such schemes need very careful planning and management. Sustainable drainage is often used in towns and cities,which are prone to flash flooding after sudden heavy rain. This happens in urban areas because large areas of ground are covered in concrete and tarmac. Rain is channelled straight into drainage systems, which can become overwhelmed. Builders are now required to landscape developments, so that water from roofs and driveways seeps into open ground rather than rushing into the water system. Guidelines suggest the ground should be able to absorb the water - a process known as infiltration. Large ""detention basins"" can also be built to collect rainwater and hold it, while ponds offer further water-holding capacity. The basic aim of dredging is to remove silt - which consists of fine sand, clay and small particles of rock - from the river's bed, potentially increasing its capacity to carry water downstream. The process usually involves an excavator, or vacuum pump, mounted on a barge or on the riverbank, to remove silt from the river. But the issue of whether rivers should be dredged is not clear-cut. The Environment Agency says that while dredging can improve general land drainage, it cannot prevent rivers from flooding, due to the huge volumes of water involved. In some cases dredging can even make flooding worse. Prof Dan Parsons from the University of Hull says: ""It is the water surface slope of the river, rather than the river bed that is most important in moving water through a landscape. In lowland reaches, where rivers meet tidal forces, dredging can actually make matters worse by reducing this surface slope."" Dredging is also costly, sometimes harmful to the environment, and can weaken riverbanks as well as the foundations of bridges and weirs. After a major flood, large volumes of silt may accumulate in slow-flowing areas and the river may need to be dredged repeatedly. The government has promised to spend Â£5.2bn over five years to fund flood defences in England, with Â£860m being spent on 1,000 schemes this year. Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland control their own flood schemes. The Welsh government promised to spendÂ£36m this year in flood defences,external, maintenance and management, and Northern Ireland's2021/22 Budget allocated Â£19m,external. The Scottish government said it had spent at least Â£42m a year on flood protection since 2007, and in 2020 pledged an extra Â£150m over the next five years, and spends a further Â£195,000 per year to ""build flood resilience within communities"". Flooding can come from all sorts of water sources, including groundwater, reservoirs and surface water. But cities and towns that lie on rivers or near the sea are most at risk. Generally speaking, increased rainfall causes flooding inland, while high tides and storms are behind much coastal flooding - and both can happen together. And while many factors contribute to flooding, climate change makes extreme rainfall more likely. Awarmer atmosphere can hold more moisture,externaland so these storms become more intense. Flood planners 'must prepare for worst' In 2019, Environment Agency chairwoman Emma Howard Boyd said that some communities might eventually have to move entirely. ""We can't win a war against water by building away climate change with infinitely high flood defences,"" she said.

Woman dies and dozens evacuated as floods hitStranded residents are rescued from their homes after parts of England are deluged with heavy rain.England,"This video can not be played Drone footage filmed from Matlock shows the extent of the floodwater A woman has died after becoming submerged in floodwater as parts of England were deluged with a month's worth of rain in a day. Her body was found hours after she was swept into Derbyshire's River Derwent. Elsewhere, people have been evacuated from their homes as rivers reached record levels in some areas. During a visit to the area, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""We need to prepare and we need to be investing in defences."" The Derwent is expected to peak in Derby city centre at 22:00 GMT, while police have ordered the closure of a main route into the city. The woman was reported to have been swept away by floodwater in Rowsley, near Matlock, in the early hours of Friday and the body was found about two miles away in Darley Dale. Flooding in Yorkshire: As it happened East Midlands flooding: As it happened Derbyshire Police said her family had been informed and formal identification was yet to take place. Mark Hopkinson, who witnessed the emergency operation to find the woman, said he saw police officers and mountain rescuers searching in the area. ""We saw a little drone go up and the coastguard helicopter came, and that was then circling, hovering over some trees,"" he said. There has been severe flooding in Darley Dale where the woman's body was found The heaviest rainfall on Thursday night was at Swineshaw in the Peak District, which had 112mm (4.4in) in 24 hours. Parts of Sheffield experienced 85mm - just 3mm (0.1in) less than the area's monthly average. More than 100 flood warnings are in place across England. In pictures: Rain floods parts of northern England How do you stop flooding? Dozens sleep at shopping centre amid floods The Environment Agency has issuedsix severe flood warnings,externalfor locations on the River Don. Fran Lowe, from the Environment Agency (EA), urged people to take them seriously ""as they represent a threat to life"". ""Respond immediately and get out of any place affected by a severe flood warning,"" he said. Boris Johnson visited Matlock where he met emergency workers The River Don, which flows through Sheffield, Rotherham and Doncaster, has hit its highest recorded level, at just over 6.3m, higher than it was in 2007 when it also flooded. South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service said in the past 28 hours crews rescued more than 120 people, with about 1,200 calls to its control room. In Doncaster: Residents in Yarborough Terrace, in the Bentley area, were rescued by boat as waist-high water filled the street More than 50 people were rescued from static homes at Willow Bridge Caravan Site since the river overtopped In Rotherham: People were told to stay at home and not leave unless asked to do so by the emergency services Firefighters used boats to rescue people who were stranded in the Parkgate shopping centre on Thursday night, with dozens spending the night at the town hall The EA said it was using high-volume pumps to move water away from homes in Catcliffe, one of the areas of greatest concern People were taken to safety in boats in Rotherham While visiting Matlock in Derbyshire, Boris Johnson thanked emergency workers and said he was impressed at how people ""had pulled together"". He said: ""It's businesses particularly who deserve our sympathies and they've had a really tough time. ""You cannot underestimate the psychological effect of flooding on people - it is a big, big blow. ""People have been moved out of their homes and probably hundreds of businesses have seen damage to their properties - we stand ready to help in any way that we can."" Some residents of Yarborough Terrace in Doncaster criticised the official response The town's mayor, Liberal Democrat David Hughes, said: ""Is this an election stunt or is the government concerned for the people of Matlock? ""It's very difficult to determine."" In Derby, flood defences were built on Exeter Bridge as the River Derwent continued to rise. The A52, the main route into the city from the M1 was one of several roads partly closed due to flooding and many bus services were suspended. It reached its highest-ever recorded level and is expected to peak at 22:00. Some premises in the city have been evacuated and Derby Theatre has cancelled performances for the night. This video can not be played Watch: Aerial views of Mansfield mudslide Elsewhere in the East Midlands: A ""major incident"" has been declared in Worksop, Nottinghamshire, after dozens of homes were evacuated Residents from 28 properties in Mansfield have been told it is still unsafe for them to return home after a mudslide on Thursday Every time there's serious flooding, questions are asked about why it was allowed to happen. One simple answer is governments of all parties have been accused of not spending enough on protection. You can build walls along river banks and many places have been guarded this way but such 'hard defences' are expensive and obtrusive. An alternative is to employ what are known as soft defences. These include encouraging farmers to manage their land in ways that let fields hold back floodwater. Driveways and car parks can be surfaced with materials that allow it to reach the soil underneath. Another option is to make homes more resilient - fitting exterior doors with waterproof plastic panels, sealing the ground floor and raising fuse boxes. In some ways the country has become better prepared for flooding but lessons are not always learned and the misery for many keeps being repeated.

"Johnson accused of 'misunderstanding' Brexit dealAfter the PM says NI firms can ""bin"" customs forms, Labour accuses him of not understanding his deal.Northern Ireland","This video can not be played ""There will not be checks on goods going from NI to GB,"" Boris Johnson tells Conservative supporters Boris Johnson has been accused of not understanding his Brexit deal or what it means for businesses in Northern Ireland. Labour criticised him after he briefed Conservative members on Thursday. The prime minister said companies could ""bin"" customs forms because there would be ""no barriers of any kind"" to trade crossing the Irish Sea. But that contradicts what Brexit Secretary Steve Barclay said last month about customs declarations for goods. Mr Barclay saidbusinesses in Northern Ireland would have to submit customs declaration formsafter he initially denied that was the case. Did PM get Brexit deal details right? Johnson a 'passionate unionist' On Friday, Labour's Shadow Brexit Secretary Sir Keir Starmer tweeted that Mr Johnson's remarks to Conservative Party members in Northern Ireland suggested he ""either doesn't understand the deal he has negotiated or he isn't telling the truth"".

In a video of the meeting, which has appeared on social media, businessman Irwin Armstrong asked Mr Johnson if he could tell his staff ""we will not be filling in any customs declarations for good leaving Northern Ireland to go to GB"". Mr Johnson replied: ""You can."" He added: ""If somebody asks you to do that tell them to ring up the prime minister and I will direct them to throw that form in the bin. ""There will be no forms, no checks, no barriers of any kind - you will have unfettered access."" On Friday, broadcasters questioned Mr Johnson about his remarks. He told reporters: ""Northern Ireland and the rest of GB are part of the UK customs territory and there can be no checks between goods operating in one customs territory. ""We're the UK - we will not be instituting such checks."" Analysis: Jonathan Blake, BBC News political correspondent Boris Johnson may have been trying to keep the focus of this campaign on his deceptively simple slogan of ""get Brexit done"" but three days in he's already found himself bogged down in the detail of his deal. His words to Tory supporters in Northern Ireland on Thursday were an attempt to allay fears that businesses there would be subject to extra paperwork when shipping goods to the rest of the UK. But with little detail - and confusing messages from ministers about how that aspect of his Brexit deal will work - the picture is unclear. The prime minister will continue to present it as an agreement that is ready to go if he wins a majority at next month's general election. Mr Armstrong, who said his company makes small shipments to pharmacies in the rest of the UK, was not sure Mr Johnson was being ""absolutely serious in his answer"". The businessman told the PA Media news agency: ""I want to believe him but is he just being bombastic and being Boris? ""I don't know Boris Johnson well enough, whether it's just what you say on a campaign trail or whether he is absolutely serious."" This video can not be played 'The Brexit minister didn't really know the answer' At the same event on Thursday night, Mr Johnson also told Conservative members Northern Ireland had ""got a great deal"". He added: ""You keep free movement, you keep access to the single market but you also have, as it says in the deal, unfettered access to GB."" Analysis: Chris Page, BBC News Ireland correspondent Trade experts say they believe there will need to be checks on goods moving from Great Britain to Northern Ireland - even if they are not destined to cross the Irish border. That is because under the Brexit deal Northern Ireland will have to follow some of the rules of the European single market - on food produce, for example. There are strict regulations on ""products of animal origin"", which must enter the EU through a border inspection post where goods are frequently checked. These issues may be very technical but in the context of Brexit and the election they are also highly political - and not just in Northern Ireland, where they are going to matter the most in practical terms. BBC News NI's economics and business editor John Campbell saidit was ""not completely clear"" what Mr Johnson meantby ""free movement"" in that context. ""Free movement gives all citizens of EU countries the right to travel, live and work wherever they wish within the EU,"" he added. ""The government has promised to end free movement and this will also apply in Northern Ireland. ""It seems that Mr Johnson was referring to the continuation of the Common Travel Area, which allows passport-free travel between the UK and Ireland and gives British and Irish citizens a range of rights in each other's countries."" The Liberal Democrats criticised the prime minister after the comments for wanting to treat Northern Ireland differently to the rest of the UK. The party's Brexit spokesman Tom Brake told PA Media: ""The single market and freedom of movement are a great deal - even Boris Johnson recognises this. ""So why isn't he keeping them for the whole of the UK as part of the many benefits of EU membership? ""It is clear that the best deal for the UK is the one we have now - in the EU,"" he said.

Women 'ignored and derided' at historic festival,"Hawick Common Riding celebrates the history of the Scottish Borders town One of Scotland's most historic summer festivals is being urged to reform amid accusations of sexism and intimidation. Hawick Common Riding could lose thousands of pounds worth of funding following a series of complaints about behaviour towards women. They include claims that some female participants faced discrimination, derision and hostility at the event. Festival organisers said they had held a ""constructive and positive"" meeting with senior council officials. Organisers said they were working to ""rectify the situation"" after complaints led to the withholding of a Â£9,300 grant from Scottish Borders Council. The row comes more than 20 years after two young women first defied convention and joined Hawick Common Riding. Women no longer face physical barriers and protests but a small group of local ""lady riders"" claim they still cannot enjoy the unfettered access enjoyed by men. This video can not be played Gillian Morgan was booed and had paper thrown at her when she left an official Hawick Common Riding ceremony earlier this year Following this year's event, Scottish Borders Council received 29 emails of complaint from 12 people, mostly related to behaviour directed at female participants. The accusations include: One female official was booed and had paper and a water bottle thrown at her as she left an official ceremony ""Venom"" was directed at lady riders taking part in ceremonial events by people including committee members and former principals Complainers said the behaviour ranged from being ignored to being booed, heckled, sworn at and called a ""disgrace"". One woman said she felt unsafe When the behaviour was directed at riders in the presence of committee members and marshals, no action was taken Speeches at previously male-only gatherings were addressed to ""gentlemen"" and ignored the presence of women Hawick Common Riding committee failed to promote the participation of both men and women The committee had not dealt properly with the complaints it had received. The local authority is now withholding an annual grant until it is satisfied the committee has dealt with the matter. In emails obtained by BBC Scotland under Freedom of Information laws, the council's chief legal officer, Nuala McKinlay, outlined the issues. ""There is concern that... women were on some occasions tolerated but more often ignored or even derided,"" she wrote to the common riding committee. She asked that they publish a ""very positive statement"" welcoming all women to the festival. An email dated 30 July 2019 said that eight complaints were outstanding. Until recent years, the Hut has been an exclusively male preserve The first of a series of similar events held across the south of Scotland every summer, Hawick Common Riding celebrates the capture of an English flag in 1514 - shortly after the Battle of Flodden - by the youth of the town at Hornshole. It also marks the ancient custom of riding the marches, or boundaries, on the common land. The election of the Cornet - a young, unmarried local man - in May marks the beginning of a five week schedule of ceremonies, ride-outs, re-enactments, rituals and picnics. 10 things about the Common Ridings In pictures: Hawick Common Riding For many local residents it is the highlight of their year, the importance of which cannot be easily explained to outsiders. Lisa Mackay says she takes part in the common riding to ""honour and recreate history"". ""It's a real privilege to be up on the hills on a horse and that's probably the main reason that I do it,"" she said. Ashley Simpson and Mandy Graham took part in the common riding in 1996 Despite being a predominantly male occasion in the past, women riders did take part in the early 1900s. They were only banned after 1931, when one woman fell off her horse and broke her leg. When Ashley Simpson, 23, and Mandy Graham, 21, made clear their intention to join the men of Hawick on horseback in 1996, they faced protests and anger in their hometown. But they won a court battle and eventually the lady riders reached a compromise - they would ride a number of preliminary ride-outs, but would not follow the cornet in ceremonial rides or attend events like the ""picking night"" smoker or the celebrations at St Leonard's Hut. The common riding dinner and ball, the colour bussing ceremony and exiles night - a reception for former residents of Hawick - have always been open to men and women. ""Traditionalists"" blocked the lady riders from joining the common riding in a high profile protest in 1996 The compromise held good for almost 20 years until in 2018 the first women took part in the Thursday night chase. It was filmed fora BBC Scotland programme, The Common Riding. As a registered charity and the recipient of public funds, the common riding committee hassigned up to equality rules,externalforbidding it from preventing protected groups - like women - from attending its events. In addition, it must eliminate both direct and indirect discrimination, victimisation and harassment, promote equal opportunities and foster good relations between groups. Gillian Morgan is a vocal campaigner for women's equal access to the common riding. Video circulated on social media shows she was booed and had ripped paper thrown at her as she left the colour bussing ceremony. ""I didn't know it was coming but nothing surprises me,"" she told BBC Scotland. ""I think I'm so used to this type of abuse that I don't particularly like it but I have to sit back and think I'm not going to let you get the better of me."" Gillian Morgan, a common riding baillie, was the target of abuse at the Colour Bussing It came the night after the Cornet and the Cornet's Lass were presented with a controversial gift from Hawick Community Council. Instead of the traditional trinkets to commemorate their experience, a donation was made in their name to the Scottish Borders Rape Crisis Centre. The move sparked an outcry and Ms Morgan, as then-chairwoman of the community council, was the focus of some anger. She was targeted at the colour bussing ceremony, while a local crowd-funding appeal raised more than Â£1,300 which paid for gifts for the principal couple and a number of other charitable donations in their name. ""I knew it was different but I didn't really expect the reaction that there was,"" Ms Morgan said. ""I think they've taken it as if we're having a dig at men - and that wasn't the case."" Another woman who takes part in the ride-outs told BBC Scotland she was verbally abused while on horseback outside Hawick town hall. Police said a 75-year-old man had been charged and would be the subject of a report to the procurator fiscal. The woman, who asked not to be named, said the intimidation of lady riders was ""far more subtle"" than it has been in the past, and she had been left to feel like a ""second class citizen"". She said it had caused rifts between friends and families. Lisa Mackay was one of the first women to take part in the ceremonial Chase in 2018 Lisa Mackay complained that the Cornet did not recognise the accomplishments of women - including her 15-year-old daughter - who completed one of the most gruelling challenges of the common riding. She said he read out the names of only the men and boys who completed the Mosspaul ride-out, during an event in St Leonard's Hut. ""It's not just about equality,"" she said. ""Not mentioning a kid who's gone out there and ridden 30 miles for you, it's about being a decent, neighbourly human being."" She said her overall experience of the common riding was better than last year, when she received a threatening phone call after taking part in a ceremonial ride-out. ""There's still a lot of things you could complain about but this is a great town, with great people and they've been - this year - very, very good to me,"" she said. The vet added: ""I love living here. The village has raised my children, I have a great life, a well-paid job and the people of Hawick afford me that lifestyle. ""But when it comes to the common riding, it's all just forgotten about. You're on your own, you're out on a limb. ""I wish folk could just actually talk about it but there's no mediation, there's no willingness to engage in discussion to take it forward."" Withholding the Â£9,300 festival grant is unlikely to put in jeopardy the future of Hawick Common Riding - in 2018 it hadreserves of more than Â£200,000,external. But it is a symbolic blow to the committee which insists ""everyone is welcome"" to the festival yet urges the community to respect its ""customs and traditions"". Campaigners want to see women actively welcomed to events like the congratulatory smoker, a traditionally male-only party celebrating the selection of the new cornet. Some women are selected to act as ""principal ladies"" and attend certain events at the common riding Neighbours and local school children spill out into the street to see the cornet taken from his home to the event - but his female relatives are not expected join him for the occasion. One of a handful of women who broke convention to attend this year's event said: ""When else in his life would his mum not be there? His P1 teacher? Everyone who has meant something over the years? Everyone who is excited?"" Scotland's charity regulator, the OSCR, said it was also considering concerns about equality issues at Hawick Common Riding. Scottish Borders Council said it held a ""positive"" meeting with the common riding committee on Wednesday and the local authority has suggested a ""possible way forward"". A small number of women have begun going to St Leonard's Hut - once reserved strictly for men BBC Scotland made repeated requests to speak to Hawick Common Riding committee but they did not respond. However Cameron Knox, the committee's chairman, referred to the issue at its annual general meeting on Thursday. He said this year's common riding made a loss of Â£10,000 because the council grant had not been paid. A meeting with the council's chief executive and chief legal officer on Wednesday was ""constructive and positive"", he added. ""We are now working along with the council to rectify the situation for this year and for the future,"" he said. Mr Knox also condemned ""faceless keyboard warriors"" who had criticised him and other office bearers on social media. ""These certain people must remember that Hawick Common Riding is bigger than any of us. It will continue for hundreds of years to come and that, ladies and gentlemen, is a fact. ""Hawick Common Riding committee looks forward to welcoming everyone - and we mean everyone - to Hawick Common Riding next year.""

Who are the victims in the Essex lorry tragedy?,"A relative lights an incense stick in front of a portrait of Bui Thi Nhung The names of 39 Vietnamese nationals who were found dead in a refrigerated lorry in Essex have been released by police. Many of their families had feared the worst ever since the bodies were discovered in the early hours of 23 October. The BBC has been speaking to friends and relatives of those who died about how they came to be the victims of the tragedy. This article will be updated as further information about the victims comes to light. The family of Pham Thi Tra Mysaid they paid Â£30,000 to people smugglersto get her to the UK. Miss Tra My, who was from Vietnam's Ha Tinh province, flew to China before travelling via France and Belgium, according to her brother. He told the BBC she first attempted to cross the border to the UK on 19 October but was caught and turned back. The last message the family received from her was at 22:30 BST on 22 October - two hours before the trailer arrived at the Purfleet terminal from Zeebrugge in Belgium. The texts, sent to her parents, read: ""I am really, really sorry, Mum and Dad, my trip to a foreign land has failed. ""I am dying, I can't breathe. I love you very much Mum and Dad. I am sorry, Mother."" Nguyen Dinh Luong, also from Ha Tinh, had been living in France but hoped to work in a nail salon in the UK. The last his father heard from him was in mid-October, explaining that the journey would cost Â£11,000. Vietnamese lorry death victims named Lorry death agony builds for Vietnamese families Vietnamese man's son feared dead in lorry incident Mr Thang was a father from Ha Tinh province. Among the youngest of the victims, Mr Hung was also from Ha Tinh. He wanted to join his parents who live in the UK, his brother told local media. His sister asked for help to find him in a Facebook post after the lorry was discovered. She wrote that he flew from Hanoi to Russia on 26 August, then to France on 6 October, but that the family lost contact when he went to the UK on 21 October. A friend who lives in Glasgow did not want to be identified, buttold the BBC he had been due to meet upwith Miss Tho - who was from Nghe An province - when she arrived in the UK. Her eyes are blurred in this image at the request of her family. Bui Thi Nhung left her job in a clothes shop in Nghe An province to travel to the UK using money that her friends had helped her raise. Once there Miss Nhung, who was also known as Anna, hoped to meet up with friends and family, and to work to pay off debt owed by her late father. She was the youngest of four siblings - and the most educated -her sister Bui Thi Loan told the BBC. The sisters had exchanged messages on Facebook on 21 October, when Miss Nhung said she was fine and ""in storage"". Originally from Nghe An province, Mr Nam had been working in Romania and planned to travel to the UK. His family did not want to be interviewed. Nguyen Dinh Tu, 26,borrowed thousands of poundswhen he was discharged from the military in order to get married and build a house. But with no work available in his hometown in Nghe An province, he went abroad to seek employment and repay his debts, leaving behind his wife and 18-month-old baby. Mr Tu paid smugglers the equivalent of around Â£4,960 in the hope of making it to the UK, according to AFP news agency. Le Van Ha left his heavily pregnant wife and young son behind in Nghe An province when he began his journey to the UK in June. He went insearch of better-paid work to repay moneythat his family had borrowed to build their house. His father, Le Minh Tuan, mortgaged two plots of land to fund the Â£20,000 journey. ""I don't know when we can ever pay it back. I'm an old man now, my health is poor, and I have to help bring up his children,"" he said. Less than two weeks before his body was found in Essex, Nguyen Van Hung was photographed with his cousin, Hoang Van Tiep, at the Eiffel Tower in Paris. The music graduate had tricked his parents when he left Nghe An to join his cousin in France last year, leaving his passport at home and travelling on a different one. He found work in a kitchen but had spoken about how it was hard, and said he wanted to grow marijuana in the UK. Hoang Van Tiep, Nguyen Van Hung's cousin, left Nghe An province for France in 2017, funded by his mother, who borrowed money from banks and relatives to fund the trip. Once there, he worked illegally at a restaurant, his mother said. He was arrested multiple times and his passport was taken. On being threatened with deportation, he told his mother he wanted to travel to the UK. Having worked in his family's timber business, Mr Thai had often talked about leaving Nghe An province and going abroad. He told his family he was going to Germany for business, his mother told the BBC. But after several phone calls in the first few days, they stopped hearing from him. Mr Hung, who was from Thua Thien - Hue province, had been speaking to his family about trying to get to the UK in mid-October, according to his brother-in-law, Tom Wright, who is a US citizen but lives with his wife in Vietnam. Believing that he would have a better life in the UK, Mr Hung's mother agreed to pay the estimated $15,000 (Â£11,800). He was in regular contact with his family while travelling through Europe, sending a photo of himself and a friend in front of the Eiffel Tower. He told his mother that he would be boarding a truck and would contact her in a few days, once he had reached the UK - but he never did. Mr Du left his home in Ha Tinh province in June, staying in Germany for 15 days and France for three months, hisfather told Vietnamese media.,external The last his father heard from him was on 22 October, when he called to say he was about to leave for the UK.

Trump wants whistleblower named despite 'danger',"US President Donald Trump has called for the whistleblower who triggered the impeachment inquiry to be unmasked, ignoring a cease-and-desist warning. On Thursday a lawyer for a whistleblower told the White House that Mr Trump's rhetoric was placing his client and family in physical danger. Undeterred by the letter, Mr Trump renewed his attacks on the whistleblower and lawyer on Friday. The individual's identity has so far been fiercely guarded by Democrats. In August the whistleblower filed a report that eventually triggered impeachment proceeding against Mr Trump. The report expressed concern over a phone call a month earlier in which Mr Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden, a Democratic front-runner for the 2020 US presidential election. The Trump impeachment story explained Trump denies asking attorney general to clear him In Thursday's letter, sent to White House counsel Pat Cipollone, the whistleblower's lawyer Andrew Bakaj cites many examples of the president's ""fixation"" on the identity of his client in his comments to the media, at rallies and on Twitter. ""Such statements seek to intimidate my client - and they have,"" Mr Bakaj writes. He continued: ""Should any harm befall any suspected named whistleblower or their family, the blame will rest squarely with your client."" But the next day, Mr Trump launched a fresh attack at the White House. ""The whistleblower is a disgrace to our country... and the whistleblower because of that should be revealed,"" he told reporters. ""And his lawyer who said the worst things possible two years ago, he should be sued, and maybe for treason."" Mr Trump may have been referring to the whistleblower's other lawyer, Mark Zaid, who has been under fire from the president's allies over tweet posted in 2017 in which he vowed - among other things - to ""get rid of him [Mr Trump]"". Meanwhile, the president's daughter, Ivanka Trump, said in an interview with the Associated Press news agency that she did not believe the whistleblower's identity was ""particularly relevant"". This video can not be played Trump impeachment: What you might have missed ""The whistleblower shouldn't be a substantive part of the conversation,"" she said, adding that the person ""did not have firsthand information"". She echoed her father's view that the impeachment investigation was about ""overturning the results of the 2016 election"". Democrats have said the whistleblower's identity is immaterial. They argue that the complaint, which alleges abuse of power by Mr Trump, has been substantiated by witness testimony to the impeachment committees. The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives will next week hold televised hearings for the first time in this inquiry. If the House eventually votes to impeach Mr Trump, the Republican-controlled Senate will hold a trial of the president. If Mr Trump is convicted - which is widely viewed at present as unlikely - he would be removed from office. But Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican, said on Thursday that he wanted to know the identity of the whistleblower if there was an impeachment trial. He also said the president's team should be able to question the anonymous official. ""How else are we going to evaluate the content and the truthfulness of these people if we don't know who they are?"" Mr Hawley told Missouri radio station KFTK. Also on Friday, transcripts of testimony from White House National Security Council (NSC) experts Fiona Hill and Lt Col Alexander Vindman revealed new claims about acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney. The closed-door depositions last month showed that both officials said Mr Mulvaney had played a key role in co-ordinating a reported exchange of favours, under which Ukraine would announce an inquiry into the Bidens in exchange for the release of congressionally approved military aid. Ms Hill, the White House's top Russia expert, quoted her former boss on the NSC John Bolton as saying that he wanted no part of the ""drug deal"" being arranged by Mr Mulvaney and other Trump appointees. Lt Col Vindman, the NSC's top Ukraine expert and Army veteran told the House committees that Mr Mulvaney had ""co-ordinated"" a plan to condition a White House meeting with Mr Trump in exchange for an investigation into the Biden family. Mr Mulvaney was ordered by Congress to testify behind closed doors on Friday, but refused, citing an ""absolute immunity"". What exactly is the role of Ivanka Trump?

Born Slippy noise pest neighbour fined,"Born Slippy, which famously featured on the Trainspotting soundtrack, was a huge hit for techno act Underworld in 1995 A noisy neighbour who blasted out dance anthem Born Slippy on a loop has been warned he could face jail if he fails to keep the noise down. Clyde Taylor, 54, ignored official warnings to stop playing the Underworld track in the early hours. Hi-fi equipment, speakers and an electric guitar were seized from his home in Eccles after repeated breaches of a noise abatement notice. He was also ordered to pay a Â£1,500 fine, and a Â£30 victim surcharge. A court order obtained by Salford Council prevents him from playing music or ""permitting music to be played at a level that can be heard outside the property"". The authority said the action could have been avoided had Mr Taylor obeyed the first ""polite request to keep the noise down"". Councillor David Lancaster said a little ""neighbourly consideration"" would have prevented action being taken. ""If people refuse to be reasonable and considerate then we will use our full powers,"" he said. The council confiscated two sets of equipment Mr Taylor did not attend court in October, and was found guilty in his absence of eight breaches of failing to comply with a noise abatement notice.

Cost of girl's 200-mile trips for cancer treatment,"This video can not be played Â£600 a month to travel for cancer treatment Parents of a child who has to make 200-mile round trips for cancer treatment are calling for more help with the costs of travel. Elin Rowlands, 13, from Anglesey, was diagnosed with leukaemia in 2013 and had to travel to Liverpool's Alder Hey hospital to get specialist treatment. Elin's mother said it cost them between Â£35 and Â£40 for each return trip. The Welsh Government said some families are eligible to claim for travel costs if they meet certain criteria. There is a specialist cancer unit for young people in Cardiff but there is no service for those further north. Alison Rowlands gave up work to care for her daughter Elin and said she had to depend on friends for financial help when their car broke down. Mrs Rowlands toldNewyddion 9: ""At the start it was very scary... you don't think about the journey right, it's get your daughter there, get her better. ""It's then as the treatment goes on, that it's 'oh my goodness, I've got to go there a lot'. ""We were spending roughly Â£35 to Â£40 each trip to go there and come back and most of them were day trips, and there's a lot of them. ""We stayed there quite a lot in the beginning, but then we had to go back about four times a week. Elin, pictured with her mother, suffered a relapse last year ""You had to look at the diary constantly, what time are we going? When do we need to set off? Have we got petrol in the car? ""My husband drove most of the time, but because of his job he couldn't do it all the time. ""I wouldn't like to imagine how much I've spent on the fuel in that amount of time. ""You worry enough about your daughter going through this horrible treatment without having to worry where the money's going to come to put petrol in the car."" Boy's 'neck pain' was rare throat cancer 'Why me? I had ovarian cancer at 14' Teenage cancer patient aims to promote body image Mrs Rowlands said the local community pulled together and collected ""a really good amount of money"" they were able to spend on fuel. ""If the government did decide to help out with families, that would be amazing - until you go through something like this, you have no idea whatsoever."" Elin relapsed in January 2018 and needed a bone marrow transplant, but had to be transferred to a unit in Manchester. She still travels to Liverpool and Manchester for tests, but no longer needs treatment. Alder Hey children's hospital cares for over 330,000 young people every year Richard Pugh, from the Wales Cancer Alliance, is also backing the calls for more support: ""The cost ramifications are huge because those specialist services aren't that local. ""You've got to travel. Unless you're in Cardiff and those services are right on your doorstep."" The charity CLIC Sargent estimated Elin's family would spend on average Â£600 a month on travel costs. The charity want the Welsh Government to create a Â£250,000 annual travel fund, to help families pay for travel costs. Mr Pugh said: ""What we'd like to see is a travel fund for young people affected by cancer so they don't have that financial burden."" Richard Pugh said ""in an ideal world"" there would be multiple treatment units across the country The Teenage Cancer Trust unit at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff is the only specialist unit for young people with cancer in Wales. Ashley Bassett, 23, from Pencoed, Bridgend, was diagnosed with leukaemia when he was studying for his GCSEs and visited the unit. ""This unit is very important. It's a place I can come and relax. It's a nice environment. There's a pool table, TV and games,"" he said. ""There's opportunities to try and be as normal as you can in hospital, because hospitals aren't the place to be sometimes, but this unit makes it much more bearable. ""It's unfortunate that people live too far away to come here for treatment."" Cancer survival improvements slow down Breast cancer taboo 'can cause isolation' Fast cancer checks urged for north Wales Mr Pugh said ""in an ideal world"" there would be multiple units across Wales. ""Unfortunately, our workforce isn't in the condition it should be to do that,"" he said. Ashley Bassett said the support unit he used has a ""nice environment"" ""We're at a real cusp of some massive issues with our workforce, not just for children but across the board. ""So we need to make sure that we get the support for patients in the right location, at the right time. At this time, it does mean travelling."" The Welsh Government said some families can be eligible to claim for travel costs if they meet certain criteria, such as claiming benefits. A spokesperson said: ""Families can be eligible to claim help for travel costs from the NHS if their child has to go to hospital for NHS treatment. ""We are committed to the provision of excellent care for children and young people but recognise that this may require families to travel outside of their health board area. ""While we appreciate the impact this has on families, it is also important to ensure that children and young people can receive expert care for what are often complex conditions from a sustainable service.""

Teen stabbed to death at knife awareness course,"Hakim Sillah was attacked at Hillingdon Civic Centre on Thursday A teenager who was fatally stabbed in a council headquarters in west London was attending a knife awareness course. Hakim Sillah was attacked in the youth offending service department at the Hillingdon Civic Centre in Uxbridge on Thursday. The Met said a group had gathered at the venue when a fight broke out. The 18-year-old was taken to hospital but died an hour later. A 17-year-old boy who was arrested on suspicion of murder remains in custody. A teenage boy who tried to stop the fight also sustained a knife wound to his ear. He was praised by detectives for ""bravely"" trying to break up the fight. Another teenager suffered a knife injury to his ear during the attack In a statement, Mr Sillah's family described him as ""a lovely lad who cared about his family"". ""He loved looking after his little brother, who had been ill,"" they said. Det Ch Insp Noel McHugh described the attack as ""an absolute tragedy"" and praised the teenager who tried to stop the fight. ""A young man with his whole life ahead of him has been fatally attacked and his family are absolutely devastated,"" he said. ""We are doing everything we can to find those involved. ""What we know so far is that a fight broke out between males at the location and as a result this young man received fatal injuries. ""A second independent male, bravely tried to intervene to break up the fight and as a result was also stabbed."" Hillingdon Civic Centre was cordoned off while forensic officers investigated Hillingdon Council said it was ""offering support and counselling"" to any of its employees affected. It is the second murder investigation to be launched in Hillingdon this year - after Tashan Daniel was stabbed to death at Hillingdon Tube Station on 24 September.

Farage makes last ditch plea for pact with Tories,"Nigel Farage: ""We are the challengers here in south Wales"" Nigel Farage has said the Brexit Party will try ""for a few more days"" to agree an electoral pact with the Tories. Campaigning in south Wales, he said his party would beat Labour in ""many constituencies"" in the region if the Conservatives withdrew from the field. But he also denounced Boris Johnson's deal with the EU as ""not Brexit"", calling it a ""short term political fix"" to win December's general election. He also challenged the prime minister to ahead-to-head debateon the deal. Nigel Farage will not stand as election candidate Minister quits in aide's rape trial 'sabotage' row Tory party has 'failed' working people - Drakeford Plaid Cymru's 'ambition for Wales without limit' The event took place on Friday in Little Mill near Pontypool, just over the border from the Labour-held constituency of Torfaen but located in the Tory-held constituency of Monmouth. Speaking at a village hall, Mr Farage had this message for Mr Johnson: ""If you really believe that this is a great new deal, or as you said in the last couple of days a fantastic deal, if you are really trying to tell the British public this gets Brexit done, let's have a civilised head-to-head debate on what this EU treaty means and I'd be only be too happy to stand with Boris to talk this through."" Last week, Boris Johnsonrejected suggestionsthat he should work with the Brexit Party during the election. Plaid Cymru, Liberal Democrats and the Greens have agreed apro-EU electoral pactin 11 of the 40 seats in Wales. Repeating his call for a leave alliance, Mr Farage said: ""if that leave alliance was put to the country it would win a very big majority"". Boris Johnson said last week he was ""always grateful for advice"" but would not enter into pacts Mr Farage denied trying to split the vote and accused the Conservative Party of not wanting to come to ""any sort of accommodation"". ""I'm going to go on trying for a few more days and make the point that in Torfaen, and other constituencies here in south Wales, the Conservatives haven't won for a hundred years,"" he said. ""And they're not going to win here on 12 December, there is no chance of them winning. ""So I would make this urgent plea to Boris Johnson and others - don't split the Brexit Party vote here in south Wales. ""We are the challengers here in south Wales and if you're not in the field we will beat Labour in many of these constituencies."" Mr Farage said the prime minister should ditch his Brexit deal because ""it's not Brexit, it's a short term political fix and an attempt to win a general election"". He urged Mr Johnson to ""make it clear that we absolutely have to leave"" the EU ""at some point in 2020, with or without any form of deal"". That deal ""must be a trade deal, not one based on regulatory and political alignment"", he added. Nigel Farage and MEP Nathan Gill meeting voters in Merthyr Tydfil ahead of May's European elections Mr Farage said his party was ready to fight all the Welsh seats, if there was no pact with the Conservatives. Asked earlier on BBC Radio Wales how many seats his party would win, Mr Farage said: ""I've no idea. Do you know, when I launched the campaign for the European elections, going back to April this year, I had no idea how we would do. ""We comfortably topped the poll in Wales, coming first in many, many seats."" Asked if he would publish an election manifesto, Mr Farage said he would produce what he called a ""contract with the British people"". He said it was 95% ready and the party would launch it in the next few weeks. Launched just seven months ago, the Brexit Party hasfour Welsh Assembly members, who were previously members of UKIP, the party Mr Farage used to lead. There are also two Welsh Brexit Party MEPs.

Suspect in torture investigation dies in police raid,"Cyril McGuinness had more than 50 convictions The main suspect in the investigation into the kidnap and torture of a Northern Ireland businessman has died during a police raid in England. Cyril McGuinness, 54, is thought to have suffered a heart attack as police searched his Derbyshire home on Friday. That search was part of a joint police operation across the UK and Ireland in which almost 20 properties were raided. Quinn Industrial Holdings (QIH) executive Kevin Lunney was beaten by a gang in on 17 September. Businessman tells of torture by gang Derbyshire Constabulary said its officers carried out the search of McGuinness's home in Buxton on behalf of the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI). ""Shortly after that warrant was carried out at 07:30 GMT, a 54-year-old man inside the property was taken ill,"" added Derbyshire Constabulary. The force said officers administered first aid and called paramedics but the man died. A convicted smuggler, Cyril McGuinness was known as ""Dublin Jimmy"" and had an extensive criminal record. The 54-year-old from Derrylin in County Fermanagh was exposed in an investigation by BBC Northern Ireland's Spotlight programme in 2004 into the illegal transport of waste. In 2007, he received a suspended sentence after he admitted 22 charges relating to the illegal transport of waste from the Republic of Ireland, through Northern Ireland to Scotland. In 2011, he was extradited to Belgium to serve a seven-year prison term for stealing lorries and cranes that were brought to Ireland. He was described in a European extradition warrant in 2008 as an ""active member of an Irish criminal organisation"". In April that year, he was stopped by Serbian police near the Croatian border - when they realised he was subject to a Europe-wide warrant he was extradited to Bruges. He faced charges in Bruges but left the country after being granted bail and was convicted in his absence. The Independent Office for Police Conduct, which handles complaints made against police forces in England and Wales, is investigating McGuinness's death. ""We have sent investigators to the property and to the police post incident procedure to begin gathering information,"" it said. Phones, computers and documents were seized during the search. As part of the police operation on Friday, the PSNI carried out five searches in Derrylin. This video can not be played Kevin Lunney was driving home from work in Kinawley when he was attacked on 17 September The Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na (Irish police force) said 100 of its officers were involved in searching five locations in County Cavan, three in County Longford and four in Dublin.Â They said the locations were a mixture of houses and commercial premises. McGuinness had been a target of the police on both sides of the Irish border for years and had more than 50 convictions. He was the main suspect in the kidnap of and violent attack on 50-year-old Mr Lunney, who was abducted as he was driving home from work in Kinawley in County Fermanagh. Mr Lunney, a father of six, had his leg broken, was slashed with a knife and doused with bleach in a two-and-a-half hour ordeal. Kevin Lunney's car was burnt close to his home after he was kidnapped He had the letters QIH cut into his chest with a knife and told the BBC's Spotlight this week that he feared that he would never see his wife and children again. After the attack, Mr Lunney was dumped on a road in County Cavan 22 miles (35km) from where he was abducted. He was found by a member of the public. Analysis by Julian O'Neill, BBC News NI home affairs correspondent Police on both sides of the Irish border are under pressure to get results after a long-running series of threats and other incidents. The campaign against QIH and senior staff has spanned several years. There have been scores of incidents but to date no-one has been charged. The abduction of Kevin Lunney represented a significant ratcheting-up of things. Police have given priority to the investigation and the scale of the co-ordinated searches appears to represent a major response. The PSNI's Det Ch Insp Julie Mullan said its detectives would ""continue to work closely"" with the Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na and Derbyshire Constabulary to try to ""bring the perpetrators to justice"". In the past week, signs near the headquarters of QIH in Derrylin attacking the directors have been removed and the PSNI has increased its patrols in the area. The companies comprising QIH were formerly owned by Sean Quinn, who was once Ireland's richest man. When his business empire collapsed, businessmen, including his former associates, bought the companies. Posters like this are part of a campaign to intimidate Kevin Lunney, a court heard in March Mr Lunney, who worked with Mr Quinn for many years and remained loyal after the County Fermanagh tycoon's bankruptcy, was reinstated as a director and Mr Quinn was employed as a consultant. Mr Quinn left that role in 2016, later saying he was forced out and his family had been ""stabbed in the back"". He has repeatedly condemned attacks on property belonging to the owners of his former businesses. The Irish News reported on Friday thatthe directors of QIH have rejected an offer,externalto meet the Quinn family. It said Mr Quinn's son Sean Quinn Jr made the offer in a statement to the BBC's Spotlight.

Man who tried to rob Arsenal stars jailed,"This video can not be played Arsenal star confronts carjackers in London An armed mugger who tried to rob Arsenal footballers Mesut Ãzil and Sead Kolasinac has been jailed. Ashley Smith admitted attempting to steal luxury watches worth Â£200,000 from the pair in Hampstead, north-west London. A second man, Jordan Northover, 26, has alsoadmitted his role in the robbery. Smith, 30, of Archway in north London, was jailed for 10 years at Harrow Crown Court on Friday. Northover will be sentenced at a later date. Smith was also ordered to pay a Â£181 victim surcharge. Arsenal said both Sead Kolasinac and Mesut Ãzil were fine after the attempted carjacking CCTV footage showed Kolasinac chasing off two masked attackers on 25 July. In a video that circulated on social media, the 26-year-old Bosnian defender could be seen fighting off two knife-wielding men. Smith was described by Judge Ian Bourne QC as a prolific ""career criminal"" who was well known to the police. The judge said Smith had ""an appalling criminal record"" of 20 convictions from 38 offences dating back to when he was 14 years old. He was out on licence for a 42-month sentence for burglary in 2017 when he tried to rob the Arsenal duo. Ashley Smith (left) and Jordan Northover both admitted trying to rob the Arsenal stars The court heard Smith and his accomplice did not count on the bravery of Kolasinac in fighting back. The would-be robbers used a stolen moped, and were dressed in helmets and dark clothing to try and conceal their identities. The weapons were described as a 10-12 inch long screwdriver and a smaller instrument about six inches long. The players managed to flee but stones thrown at their vehicle caused ""significant"" damage. Kolasinac and the Germany midfielder were left out of the Arsenal side ahead of the opening weekend of the Premier League campaign after the attack.

"Trump placing whistleblower in danger, lawyer says","US President Donald Trump has called for the whistleblower who triggered the impeachment inquiry to be unmasked, ignoring a cease-and-desist warning. On Thursday a lawyer for a whistleblower told the White House that Mr Trump's rhetoric was placing his client and family in physical danger. Undeterred by the letter, Mr Trump renewed his attacks on the whistleblower and lawyer on Friday. The individual's identity has so far been fiercely guarded by Democrats. In August the whistleblower filed a report that eventually triggered impeachment proceeding against Mr Trump. The report expressed concern over a phone call a month earlier in which Mr Trump asked his Ukrainian counterpart Volodymyr Zelensky to investigate Joe Biden, a Democratic front-runner for the 2020 US presidential election. The Trump impeachment story explained Trump denies asking attorney general to clear him In Thursday's letter, sent to White House counsel Pat Cipollone, the whistleblower's lawyer Andrew Bakaj cites many examples of the president's ""fixation"" on the identity of his client in his comments to the media, at rallies and on Twitter. ""Such statements seek to intimidate my client - and they have,"" Mr Bakaj writes. He continued: ""Should any harm befall any suspected named whistleblower or their family, the blame will rest squarely with your client."" But the next day, Mr Trump launched a fresh attack at the White House. ""The whistleblower is a disgrace to our country... and the whistleblower because of that should be revealed,"" he told reporters. ""And his lawyer who said the worst things possible two years ago, he should be sued, and maybe for treason."" Mr Trump may have been referring to the whistleblower's other lawyer, Mark Zaid, who has been under fire from the president's allies over tweet posted in 2017 in which he vowed - among other things - to ""get rid of him [Mr Trump]"". Meanwhile, the president's daughter, Ivanka Trump, said in an interview with the Associated Press news agency that she did not believe the whistleblower's identity was ""particularly relevant"". This video can not be played Trump impeachment: What you might have missed ""The whistleblower shouldn't be a substantive part of the conversation,"" she said, adding that the person ""did not have firsthand information"". She echoed her father's view that the impeachment investigation was about ""overturning the results of the 2016 election"". Democrats have said the whistleblower's identity is immaterial. They argue that the complaint, which alleges abuse of power by Mr Trump, has been substantiated by witness testimony to the impeachment committees. The Democratic-controlled House of Representatives will next week hold televised hearings for the first time in this inquiry. If the House eventually votes to impeach Mr Trump, the Republican-controlled Senate will hold a trial of the president. If Mr Trump is convicted - which is widely viewed at present as unlikely - he would be removed from office. But Senator Josh Hawley, a Republican, said on Thursday that he wanted to know the identity of the whistleblower if there was an impeachment trial. He also said the president's team should be able to question the anonymous official. ""How else are we going to evaluate the content and the truthfulness of these people if we don't know who they are?"" Mr Hawley told Missouri radio station KFTK. Also on Friday, transcripts of testimony from White House National Security Council (NSC) experts Fiona Hill and Lt Col Alexander Vindman revealed new claims about acting White House Chief of Staff Mick Mulvaney. The closed-door depositions last month showed that both officials said Mr Mulvaney had played a key role in co-ordinating a reported exchange of favours, under which Ukraine would announce an inquiry into the Bidens in exchange for the release of congressionally approved military aid. Ms Hill, the White House's top Russia expert, quoted her former boss on the NSC John Bolton as saying that he wanted no part of the ""drug deal"" being arranged by Mr Mulvaney and other Trump appointees. Lt Col Vindman, the NSC's top Ukraine expert and Army veteran told the House committees that Mr Mulvaney had ""co-ordinated"" a plan to condition a White House meeting with Mr Trump in exchange for an investigation into the Biden family. Mr Mulvaney was ordered by Congress to testify behind closed doors on Friday, but refused, citing an ""absolute immunity"". What exactly is the role of Ivanka Trump?

As it happened: SNP launch and party plans,"The SNP launched its campaign by promising to protect the NHS from privatisation and future trade deals Labour announced plans to extend statutory maternity pay to a full year and increase flexible working rights The Conservatives proposed a fast-track ""NHS visa"" for foreign doctors and nurses to work in UK Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage were also on the campaign trail The Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party formed an electoral pact on Thursday UK goes to the polls on 12 December Dulcie Lee, Paul Gribben and Lucy Webster Today made for some whimsical photo ops as well as more serious policy announcements It's been another long day on the campaign trail, with party leaders travelling all over the UK. Here are the key points from Friday: The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, has said Labour will make ""no deals with the Scottish Nationalists."" Speaking in Crawley, she said: ""We
keep telling Nicola Sturgeon, and she does need to listen. There are no deals.
No deals."" She said this would remain the case even if the party had to form a minority government. ""If we get into power and we're a
minority government, and the Scots Nats bring us down, they will have to go
back to their voters in Scotland and explain how they've let the Tories back
in. No deals. No deals,"" she said. Ms Thornberry added: ""What we're focusing on is that within six months of a general election we get Brexit sorted."" Jo Swinson insists the Liberal Democrats would never allow another Scottish independence referendum. Ms Swinson is on a campaign visit to North East Fife, the most marginal constituency at the last election, wherethe SNP beat the Lib Dems by just two votes. The Lib Dem leader says another independence referendum is ""the last thing we need"" and warns it would only create further ""chaos"". ""Our UK family of nations is incredibly
precious,"" she says. She says her party is the only one explicitly opposing both Brexit and Scottish independence, and adds theTories' post-Brexit plans to attract more doctors and nurseswere ""insulting"" medical workers. This Matters is a new BBC series looking at issues that affect you and how you vote. It goes beyond politicians - and Brexit - to explain what's happening and what it means. This week: the environment. This video can not be played We explain the parties' environmental policies - from fracking to net zero emission targets. Long hours, media scrutiny, angry voters and canvassing in the rain. Going on the campaign trail is a gruelling experience even for the lucky ones who win. But what about those who never win but keep coming back for more? Alice Evans meets the election losers. Brian TaylorBBC Scotland Political Editor Down the decades, the SNP has deployed sundry formulae to stress their promotion of Scottish interests. One thinks, in particular, of the campaign arguing that the black gold in the North Sea was ""Scotland's oil"". Today,at the party's election launch in Edinburgh, Nicola Sturgeon essayed a new version. The SNP, she said, was ""Scotland's Remain party"". Now, self-evidently, this is primarily a method of addressing Brexit - the core, defining issue of this entire contest. A way, further, of positing the SNP firmly on the side of retaining membership of the European Union. But there is a second, equally expected, element. Which is to place Brexit in the context of the SNP's primary aim. Scottish independence. Read Brian's full analysis here. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Liberal Democrat politician Heidi Allen with Green Party MEP Molly Scott Cato, Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts and President of the UK Liberal Democrats Sal Brinton A group of Remain-supporting Labour MPs have criticised the pact agreed between the anti-Brexit parties Liberal Democrats, the Green Party and Plaid Cymru. Earlier this weekthe three parties announced an agreementnot to stand against each other in 60 constituencies across England and Wales. Labour's Clive Lewis says: ""This Remain alliance risks taking votes away from Labour in marginals
and targets good, sitting pro-Remain Labour MPs. Former till maker Charles Flavell, 84, was a lifelong Labour supporter Charles Flavell had already made his mind up which way he'd be voting before he read a damning interview from his former Labour - then independent - MP Ian Austin in his local newspaper. Mr Austintold the Express & Star,externalhe had to ""do everything I can to stop Jeremy Corbyn from getting into power"", as he announced he would not contest his Dudley North seat in the election. He's not standing for re-election and neither is former deputy leader Tom Watson, who represented constituents in West Bromwich East. Like Mr Austin, Mr Flavell, an 84-year-old former till maker and a lifelong Labour supporter, is backing Boris Johnson. Read the full story here. Alistair McGhie, BBC Wales Former Welsh Secretary Alun Cairn, speaking for the first time since resigning on Wednesday, has refused to answer questions on when he knew about the collapse of a rape trial caused by his former aide. He
said he will let the Cabinet Office look into what happened, adding that he would not be drawn into a ""trial by media"". Speaking
in the Vale of Glamorgan, the seat which he is defending, he said he's keen to
get on with the campaign. Read more on why Mr Cairns resignedandwhat he said in the interview. What's been happening today? For those of you not slavishly following every twist and turn of the election campaign, here is a round-up of what's been going on today:  Norman SmithAssistant political editor SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon knows her best route to stopping
Brexit is through a hung Parliament â if this election is again inconclusive. This would hugely increase the leverage
of her party. And today she gave her clearest indication yet that she
would be prepared to help Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street as part of that
attempt to stop Brexit â but at a price. And that price would be the removal of nuclear weapons
from Scotland, and above all the granting of another independence referendum
next year. Thatâs probably not a message that Boris Johnson will
be too worried about. Because his core campaign message at this election has
been: Vote Labour and youâll get two more referendums â one on Brexit and one
Scottish independence. You can read more about the SNP's campaign launch here. Our political reporter Peter Saull reports that Boris Johnson has told the BBC there will not be a specific inquiry into Islamophobia in the Conservative Party. Allow Twitter content?

Earlier this week Michael Gove told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: âWe will have an inquiry into Islamophobia and it will be established before the end of the year absolutely.â Earlierthe BBC announced its plansfor a series of election debates - including a face-off between the Conservative Party's Boris Johnson and Labour's Jeremy Corbyn. It will also host a seven-way podium debate and several Question Time specials -but the Liberal Democrats saidthe decision to exclude them from the head-to-head was ""another establishment stitch-up to shut down debate"". So why did the BBC do it? In a blog post, Jonathan Munro, the head of BBC Newsgathering - the part of the corporation which provides live coverage and news reports - explains the decision. ""The regulatory framework (which is the same as that for other broadcasters) means that we can scrutinise and give coverage to parties in a way that relates to their different levels of electoral support - in other words, parties may have different amounts of airtime and won't all necessarily be included in all programmes in the same way,"" he writes. ""So potential prime ministers can get more scrutiny - and airtime - than other party leaders. But that judgement is based on real votes cast, not speculation about the upcoming result. ""It means the Conservative and Labour parties - who between them secured more than 80% of the vote in 2017 - will have more prominence at times than all the smaller parties. ""That explains why head-to-head debates are now part of the mix; in 2010, the Liberal Democrats entered the election with more than 60 MPs, having won 22% of the vote - three times higher than they managed at the 2017 general election - and far ahead of the next largest parties, including the SNP, who back then, had just six MPs."" Read the post in full here. Shadow women and equalities minister Dawn Butler says a Labour government would ""dismantle the structural barriers"" facing women in the workplace. This morning,the party set out a number of policies in this area, including increasing the length of statutory maternity pay and promising the right to choose flexible working when starting a job. Speaking on a visit to Stevenage Ms Butler says many men have ""a privilege code
to the lift"", fast-tracking them into managerial positions. She adds that Labour would ""lay the grounds for an elevator"" for women,
to help them secure a level playing field in the world of work. Earlier on, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon launched her party's election campaign. Talking about the prospect of the UK leaving the EU's single market and customs union, she said: ""Economic analysis says that it will cost every person in Scotland Â£1,600"". We put that to our Reality Check team.They said the figure came from aScottish government assessment,externalin January 2018 - before either Theresa May's or Boris Johnson's deals. It estimated that leaving the single market and customs union would knock Â£9bn off Scottish output (in 2016 pounds), which it divided by the population of Scotland to get about Â£1,600 per person. So it's saying that GDP per person would be Â£1,600 lower than it would otherwise have been in 11 years, but that's not the same as costing each individual Â£1,600.

This video can not be played 'There will not be checks on goods going from NI to GB,' Boris Johnson tells NI crowd The prime minister is facing scrutiny over comments he has made about Northern Ireland. Speaking to a room of party activists on Thursday, Boris Johnson said there would not be customs checks on goods going from Northern Ireland to Great Britain under his Brexit deal. This appears to contradict his Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay, who has previously said that ""minimal targeted interventions"" would be required. Confused?BBC Northern Ireland's economics and business editor John Campbell has fact-checked Mr Johnson's comments here. It wouldn't be a general election campaign without bizarre photo ops - and the odd candid snap. So let's take a look at what Friday has served up so far: It was clay-modelling time for Boris Johnson as he visited a school in Stapleford, Nottinghamshire At this morning's campaign launch, the SNP were very on message. Or more like... in message? Nigel Farage was snapped waiting beside a training dummy backstage before speaking at a campaign rally in Wales We will of course be bringing you photos from across the political spectrum during the campaign period as and when they make us chuckle. Labour shadow health secretary Jon Ashworth says Boris
Johnson should apologise for âa decade of running down our NHSâ. He was responding toreports of patients spending hours on trolleys in corridors at the Queenâs Medical Centre in Nottingham. In an interview outside the centre, Mr Ashworth said the prime minister, whoâs been elsewhere in Nottinghamshire today, âshould be here,
apologising to the patients on trolleys, apologising to the staff who work so
hard. He should be apologising for cutting over 15,000 beds in our
NHS.â He described the Conservativesâ new medical visa plans as a
ânurses tax on those nurses who come from the EU to care for the sick and the
elderly.â Read here about the Conservatives' NHS plans to attract more overseas staff. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
Tories select wife of ex-MP facing assault charges,"The wife of an ex-Conservative MP has been chosen to contest his former seat at the general election. Natalie Elphicke was selected by Tory members to be the party's candidate in Dover and Deal. Her husband Charlie Elphicke said he was standing down to fight three charges of sexual assault. He denies any wrongdoing. Mr Elphicke said he regretted having to make way but was determined to clear his name and ensure a fair trial. Mr Elphicke, who has held the Kent seat since 2010, lost the Conservative whip this summer after being charged with three counts of sexual assault against two women. Who has selected the most women as candidates? Which MPs are standing down at the election? While he continued to sit in Parliament as an independent, as he no longer had the party whip he was not eligible to fight the seat again as a Conservative. He won the constituency for a third time in 2017 with a majority of 6,437 A lawyer by training and housing expert, Natalie Elphicke is chief executive of the Housing and Finance Institute, set up by the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition government in 2013. She has sat on the board of the Principality Building Society and Student Loans Company. She is also a former director of the Conservative Party's national policy forum. She received an OBE in the 2015 Queen's Birthday Honours for her services to housing. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Keith Single, chairman of the local Conservative association, said he was saddened by Mr Elphicke's decision to stand down but respected his reasons for doing so and remained fully supportive of him. ""We have always supported him because we believe in the principle of innocence unless proven otherwise,"" he said. ""Unfortunately, these protracted events have unfolded in a way that meant Charlie did not get the chance to clear his name before this election."" He said the association thought ""carefully"" before selecting Natalie Elphicke to succeed her husband but he believed she was an ""outstanding"" candidate who would make a first-class MP. Mrs Elphicke said she was looking forward, if elected, to building on her husband's achievements. ""I will fight tirelessly to deliver better healthcare, more jobs and money, better schools, high quality affordable housing, more police on our streets - and stronger, more secure borders,"" she said. Mr Elphicke said he was incredibly proud of what he had achieved for his constituency but his focus was now on proving his innocence. ""I have been subjected to daily falsehoods and vile abuse - from the malfeasance of cabinet ministers to the malice of Twitter trolls,"" he said. ""This has had the cumulative effect of jeopardising my right to a fair trial on charges I know to be baseless.""

Essex lorry deaths: Who are the victims?,"A relative lights an incense stick in front of a portrait of Bui Thi Nhung The names of 39 Vietnamese nationals who were found dead in a refrigerated lorry in Essex have been released by police. Many of their families had feared the worst ever since the bodies were discovered in the early hours of 23 October. The BBC has been speaking to friends and relatives of those who died about how they came to be the victims of the tragedy. This article will be updated as further information about the victims comes to light. The family of Pham Thi Tra Mysaid they paid Â£30,000 to people smugglersto get her to the UK. Miss Tra My, who was from Vietnam's Ha Tinh province, flew to China before travelling via France and Belgium, according to her brother. He told the BBC she first attempted to cross the border to the UK on 19 October but was caught and turned back. The last message the family received from her was at 22:30 BST on 22 October - two hours before the trailer arrived at the Purfleet terminal from Zeebrugge in Belgium. The texts, sent to her parents, read: ""I am really, really sorry, Mum and Dad, my trip to a foreign land has failed. ""I am dying, I can't breathe. I love you very much Mum and Dad. I am sorry, Mother."" Nguyen Dinh Luong, also from Ha Tinh, had been living in France but hoped to work in a nail salon in the UK. The last his father heard from him was in mid-October, explaining that the journey would cost Â£11,000. Vietnamese lorry death victims named Lorry death agony builds for Vietnamese families Vietnamese man's son feared dead in lorry incident Mr Thang was a father from Ha Tinh province. Among the youngest of the victims, Mr Hung was also from Ha Tinh. He wanted to join his parents who live in the UK, his brother told local media. His sister asked for help to find him in a Facebook post after the lorry was discovered. She wrote that he flew from Hanoi to Russia on 26 August, then to France on 6 October, but that the family lost contact when he went to the UK on 21 October. A friend who lives in Glasgow did not want to be identified, buttold the BBC he had been due to meet upwith Miss Tho - who was from Nghe An province - when she arrived in the UK. Her eyes are blurred in this image at the request of her family. Bui Thi Nhung left her job in a clothes shop in Nghe An province to travel to the UK using money that her friends had helped her raise. Once there Miss Nhung, who was also known as Anna, hoped to meet up with friends and family, and to work to pay off debt owed by her late father. She was the youngest of four siblings - and the most educated -her sister Bui Thi Loan told the BBC. The sisters had exchanged messages on Facebook on 21 October, when Miss Nhung said she was fine and ""in storage"". Originally from Nghe An province, Mr Nam had been working in Romania and planned to travel to the UK. His family did not want to be interviewed. Nguyen Dinh Tu, 26,borrowed thousands of poundswhen he was discharged from the military in order to get married and build a house. But with no work available in his hometown in Nghe An province, he went abroad to seek employment and repay his debts, leaving behind his wife and 18-month-old baby. Mr Tu paid smugglers the equivalent of around Â£4,960 in the hope of making it to the UK, according to AFP news agency. Le Van Ha left his heavily pregnant wife and young son behind in Nghe An province when he began his journey to the UK in June. He went insearch of better-paid work to repay moneythat his family had borrowed to build their house. His father, Le Minh Tuan, mortgaged two plots of land to fund the Â£20,000 journey. ""I don't know when we can ever pay it back. I'm an old man now, my health is poor, and I have to help bring up his children,"" he said. Less than two weeks before his body was found in Essex, Nguyen Van Hung was photographed with his cousin, Hoang Van Tiep, at the Eiffel Tower in Paris. The music graduate had tricked his parents when he left Nghe An to join his cousin in France last year, leaving his passport at home and travelling on a different one. He found work in a kitchen but had spoken about how it was hard, and said he wanted to grow marijuana in the UK. Hoang Van Tiep, Nguyen Van Hung's cousin, left Nghe An province for France in 2017, funded by his mother, who borrowed money from banks and relatives to fund the trip. Once there, he worked illegally at a restaurant, his mother said. He was arrested multiple times and his passport was taken. On being threatened with deportation, he told his mother he wanted to travel to the UK. Having worked in his family's timber business, Mr Thai had often talked about leaving Nghe An province and going abroad. He told his family he was going to Germany for business, his mother told the BBC. But after several phone calls in the first few days, they stopped hearing from him. Mr Hung, who was from Thua Thien - Hue province, had been speaking to his family about trying to get to the UK in mid-October, according to his brother-in-law, Tom Wright, who is a US citizen but lives with his wife in Vietnam. Believing that he would have a better life in the UK, Mr Hung's mother agreed to pay the estimated $15,000 (Â£11,800). He was in regular contact with his family while travelling through Europe, sending a photo of himself and a friend in front of the Eiffel Tower. He told his mother that he would be boarding a truck and would contact her in a few days, once he had reached the UK - but he never did. Mr Du left his home in Ha Tinh province in June, staying in Germany for 15 days and France for three months, hisfather told Vietnamese media.,external The last his father heard from him was on 22 October, when he called to say he was about to leave for the UK.

Vietnamese lorry death victims named,"Pham Thi Tra My, 26, and Nguyen Dinh Luong, 20, were among the victims The names of all 39 Vietnamese nationals who were found dead in a refrigerated lorry in Essex have been released by police. Ten teenagers, including two 15-year-old boys, were among the victims. Their bodies were found in a lorry trailer in an industrial park in Grays on 23 October. Essex coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray said: ""May I take this opportunity to offer my deepest condolences to the victims' families."" Assistant Chief Constable Tim Smith said: ""This was an incredibly important process and our team has been working hard to bring answers to worried families who fear their loved one may be among those whose tragic journey ended on our shores. ""Our priority has been to identify the victims, to preserve the dignity of those who have died and to support the victims' friends and families."" Bui Thi Nhung, 19, from Nghe An province, was also found dead in the lorry The bodies were discovered in a lorry trailer in the early hours of 23 October Pham Thi Tra My, 26, sent her family a message on the night of 22 October - the day before the 39 people were found dead - saying she could not breathe and her ""trip to a foreign land has failed"". Le Minh Tuan, the father of 30-year-old Le Van Ha, who comes from an agricultural part of Vietnam, previously told the BBC he was convinced his son was among the dead. By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent The process of identifying those who died in the container has taken just over two weeks. An Identification Commission, overseen by the coroner for Essex, used fingerprints, DNA, dental records and distinctive body markings such as tattoos and scars to confirm the victims' names. Most of those who died were in their 20s and 30s; there were 10 teenagers; and two were in their early 40s. Eight were women. All the victims came from central or northern Vietnam. Police say the authorities are now discussing arrangements for the bodies to be repatriated. The bodies were found on the Waterglade Industrial Estate in a container which had been shipped to nearby Purfleet from Zeebrugge in Belgium. Lorry driver Maurice Robinson, from Northern Ireland, has appeared in court charged with offences including 39 counts of manslaughter. Extradition proceedings have also begun against 22-year-old Eamonn Harrison, who was arrested in Dublin on a European Arrest Warrant.

Ashley Smith admitted attempting to steal luxury watches worth Â£200,000 from the pair in Hampstead, north-west London. A second man, Jordan Northover, 26, has alsoadmitted his role in the robbery. Smith, 30, of Archway in north London, was jailed for 10 years at Harrow Crown Court on Friday. Northover will be sentenced at a later date. Smith was also ordered to pay a Â£181 victim surcharge. Arsenal said both Sead Kolasinac and Mesut Ãzil were fine after the attempted carjacking CCTV footage showed Kolasinac chasing off two masked attackers on 25 July. In a video that circulated on social media, the 26-year-old Bosnian defender could be seen fighting off two knife-wielding men. Smith was described by Judge Ian Bourne QC as a prolific ""career criminal"" who was well known to the police. The judge said Smith had ""an appalling criminal record"" of 20 convictions from 38 offences dating back to when he was 14 years old. He was out on licence for a 42-month sentence for burglary in 2017 when he tried to rob the Arsenal duo. Ashley Smith (left) and Jordan Northover both admitted trying to rob the Arsenal stars The court heard Smith and his accomplice did not count on the bravery of Kolasinac in fighting back. The would-be robbers used a stolen moped, and were dressed in helmets and dark clothing to try and conceal their identities. The weapons were described as a 10-12 inch long screwdriver and a smaller instrument about six inches long. The players managed to flee but stones thrown at their vehicle caused ""significant"" damage. Kolasinac and the Germany midfielder were left out of the Arsenal side ahead of the opening weekend of the Premier League campaign after the attack.

"Fake rhino horn invented to ruin poachers' marketOxford scientists have developed a cheap technique for fake rhino horn to ""flood the market"".","Scientists have developed a technique for making fake rhino horn, which they hope will undermine the illegal market in the genuine article. Researchers at the University of Oxford and Fudan University in China have found a way of making fake rhino horn cheaply from horse hair. Demand for rhino horn has been blamed for driving poaching and threatening the survival of the species. The Oxford team said the fakes would ""confuse the trade"". But there has been some scepticism about whether this will be effective - with Save the Rhino International warning it could inadvertently stimulate the market for rhino horn. The conservation charity says it is more important to focus on anti-poaching measures and attempts to reduce consumer demand. Rhino horn has been claimed as an aphrodisiac in traditional Chinese medicine - which has sustained demand despite official attempts to prevent the trade. This joint UK and Chinese project is the latest attempt to find a way of making artificial horn that is realistic enough to be convincing, with the aim of flooding the market with fakes and undermining the financial incentives for poachers and smugglers. There have been previous ideas for fake horn, but this project wants a credible version that can be cheaply mass-produced. Creating fake horn is intended to reduce the financial incentive for rhino poachers The scientists say the ""horn"" of a rhino is not like the horn of a cow, but is formed from tufts of tightly packed hair that are glued together by secretions from the animal. And the team of zoologists in Oxford and molecular scientists in Fudan University in Shanghai have developed a way of compressing and moulding horse hair in a way that looks and feels similar even when the ""horn"" is cut. If credible fakes could be produced cheaply, the scientists say it would cut prices and reduce the incentive for killing the rhinos. ""It appears from our investigation that it is rather easy as well as cheap to make a bio-inspired horn-like material that mimics the rhino's extravagantly expensive tuft of nose hair,"" said Prof Fritz Vollrath, from the University of Oxford's Department of Zoology. He said he hoped the technique could be used to ""confuse the trade, depress prices and thus support rhino conservation"". But John Taylor, deputy director of Save the Rhino International, is unconvinced how much fake horn would reduce the threat to rhinos. He says there is a risk that attempts to ""flood the market"" would have the unintended consequence of expanding the market and creating even more demand, which could cause even more poaching for real rhino horn. He also questions how in practice fake horn could be inserted into an illegal black market trade. Mr Taylor is not certain that artificial horn would really convince two of the main markets - where it is ground up for traditional Chinese medicine and where wild rhino horn is used as a status symbol, particularly in Vietnam. ""There is no substitute for anti-poaching measures at one end and reducing demand at the other,"" he says.

Johnson and Corbyn to face off in live BBC debate,"The BBC will host a head-to-head debate between Boris Johnson and Jeremy Corbyn in the run-up to the general election. The Conservative and Labour leaders will face off live in Southampton on 6 December - six days before the poll. A seven-way podium debate will also take place between senior figures from the UK's major political parties on 29 November, live from Cardiff. And the BBC will broadcast several Question Time specials, including a show focused on younger audiences. LIVE: General election campaign latest First head-to-head TV election debate announced A really simple guide to the UK general election Mr Johnson said he was looking forward to the debate, tweeting: ""I can't wait to share with you all our positive vision for Britain!"" A Labour spokesman said it would ""consider all opportunities to explain our plans to voters"", which it called "" the most radical, people-focused campaign this country has ever seen"". But the Liberal Democrats called the decision to exclude them from the head-to-head ""another establishment stitch-up to shut down debate"" and said they would pursue legal action against the BBC -as they have against ITV. Party leader Jo Swinson said: ""After three years of chaos, it is shocking that the Liberal Democrats - the strongest party of Remain - are being denied the opportunity to challenge Johnson and Corbyn on Brexit."" The SNP has also complained at not being included in the head-to-head, with the party's Westminster leader, Ian Blackford, saying it ""short-changed voters in Scotland"". Meanwhile, Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage has challenged Mr Johnson to a debate over his Brexit deal, telling an audience in South Wales: ""If you are really trying to tell the British public this gets Brexit done, let's have a civilised head-to-head debate on what this EU treaty means.""

The UK's six big money problems,"Brexit continues to dominate the headlines - but the UK economy faces many other important challenges. Inequality in the housing market, poverty among working people and reducing greenhouse gas emissions are among them. For any party hoping to win power on 12 December, these are serious issues. Only 36% of those born in the late 1980s have become homeowners by the age of 30, compared with 55% or more of those born between the 1940s and the 1970s. Younger generations have seen the price of homes rise far more quickly than their salaries - the main reason for this change. This is particularly true in southern England. Many more people in their 20s and 30s are now renting privately. Their average housing costs are about 20% higher than 20 years ago. Meanwhile, low interest rates mean most owner-occupiers - many of them older people - enjoy lower housing costs than in the past. Growth in productivity - the amount the UK's workers produce per hour worked - has been unprecedentedly poor since the 2008 financial crisis. In the past 11 years, the amount workers produce every hour has grown by just 2.9%. That's about as much as it grew on average every 15 months in the preceding 40 years. As a result,productivity in the UK,externalis now 19% lower than it would have been had the trend seen before 2008 continued. This really matters. In the long-run, average living standards grow in line with growth in productivity. Average hourly wages are roughly at the same level now as they were in 2008. Given they usually rise every year, this means they are also 19% below where they would have been had long-term trends continued. A full-time worker on average hourly wages now earns Â£5,000 a year less than they would have done had the pre-2008 trend continued. Low wages have had another knock-on effect - most people living in poverty in the UK are actually in working households. In 2017-18, 58% of all those below the poverty line (less than Â£248 a week income for a couple with no children) were either in paid work or living in a household with someone who worked. This figure compares with 41% two decades ago. In part, this reflects positive trends. There are fewer households where nobody works, and pensioner incomes have increased. But it also reflects the fact for low-income workers, wages are not growing as fast as housing costs. As the UK's ageing population grows, so does the amount of money the UK spends on pensions and healthcare. In the past 30 years, spending on these areas has increased from 8.5% of national income to 13.1% - in other words, a rise of Â£100bn. It's estimated this figure will have to increase by 1.7% of national income (Â£37bn in today's terms) over the next 10 years. This is just to keep pace with changes in the population and other cost pressures. That will mean big tax rises, or spending cuts, just to keep things broadly as they are. The UK government currently takes nearly 35p in tax from every Â£1 earned - the highest share it's taken since the 1940s. Given the ageing population, and the various spending promises being made by the main parties, this is unlikely to go down any time soon. Having said that, many European countries raise more in taxes. But they tend to raise more from people on average incomes. The UK, on the other hand, tends to rely on a small number of high earners for a lot of the tax it raises. The highest-income 1% of adults pay more than a third of all income tax. The problem with this is that public finances are more vulnerable to changes in the income or behaviour of high earners. If a relatively small number leave the UK, this can have a outsized effect on taxes. The amount of money raised is also under threat because tax levels on petrol and diesel have not been maintained. And it can be difficult to raise tax from multinational companies. More like this Would you pay less tax if you lived abroad? How wealthy are you? How high could the lowest salaries go? The UK towns and cities with the highest and lowest wages The main parties all say they want to reduce the UK's greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050 at the latest. While progress has been good so far (the UK's domestic emissions are 44% down on their 1990 level), the UK is still nowhere near meeting the target. According to theCommittee on Climate Change,external, radical changes are needed in the next few years. By 2025, it says, the UK should have a plan to completely replace gas as a source of domestic heating. By the early 2030s, all new cars and vans sold should be electric. One of the economic challenges here is the less well-off spend more of their income on heating and transport costs. Any taxes targeting the carbon people produce need careful consideration to avoid making some worse off.

'Misleading' Abbott tweet used in Labour campaign,"Diane Abbott is facing criticism for posting a ""misleading"" tweet, which has been shared widely across social media and even used in Labour-affiliated advertising. The shadow home secretary compared the media coverage of ex-Labour MP Ian Austin saying he would vote for the Conservatives with the coverage of former Tory MP Ken Clarke when he spoke of being conflicted about voting for his old party in the election. She tweeted,external: ""Ian Austin, one year as a junior minister at DCLG, says he won't vote for Labour. Wall-to-wall coverage. Ken Clarke, nine years as secretary of state, including as chancellor, says he won't vote for the Conservatives. Silence. Balanced election coverage?"" According to independentfact-checking organisation Full Fact,external, Ms Abbott's tweet is incorrect and misleading. Labour voters should back Johnson - ex Labour MP Live: General election latest ""While it's true that the two sets of comments received different levels of media attention, Ms Abbott's phrasing doesn't portray them entirely accurately, overstating what Ken Clarke said and implying the two sets of comments to be more similar than they are,"" it said. ""Mr Austin didn't just say he personally wouldn't vote Labour this electionâ¦ he explicitly called on Labour voters to vote for the Conservatives. Meanwhile Ken Clarke did not say he 'won't vote for the Conservatives'. ""He did say that it was a possibility that he would not, but that it would depend on the campaign the Conservative party ran, and that he did not expect them to run a campaign which would cost them his vote."" The Labour Party declined to comment and has not removed the post from any of its platforms. The BBC has contacted Ms Abbott's team, but they have not respond to calls or emails. Ms Abbott's twitter account has 290,000 followers and her tweet has, so far, received more than 17,500 retweets and 44,000 likes on Twitter. This video can not be played Ian Austin: Jeremy Corbyn is ""completely unfit to lead our country"" Despite criticism of it by Full Fact, an image of the tweet was shared by the official Labour Party Instagram account. The account has 90,000 followers, and the post has so far attracted more than 6,200 likes and almost 300 comments. It has also been shared on Facebook by Ms Abbott, as well as Labour supporting groups, receiving around 4,000 interactions. The tweet is also being used as a paid-for advert on Facebook and Instagram, funded by a Labour-affiliated group called Labour Future. The organisation says on its website it is a group at ""the cutting edge of modern campaigning"", and it is working with Labour to ""add value"" and help the party win the election. Mr Clarke suggested his support for his party could not be taken for granted Full Fact says Mr Clarke's comments appeared to come from a Channel 4 interview on 1 November when he said his voting Conservative next month was ""not as certain as it has been in previous elections"". He suggested his support depended on what sort of campaign the party ran. ""If we really do make ourselves the Brexit Party under our brand, my loyalty is going to be strained absolutely,"" he said. ""I am not voting for some crazy right-wing nationalist organisation calling themselves a Conservative government - but that, I think, is laying it on a bit. I don't think that's where we'll wind up."" The former chancellor, who is standing down from Parliament after nearly 50 years, prefaced his statement by telling his interviewer: ""I'm slightly teasing you and myself.""

Sturgeon's SNP campaign speech fact-checked,"Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has launched the Scottish National Party's election campaign in Edinburgh. She made a few claims worth looking at - the first was about the potential impact of Brexit on Scotland. Talking about the prospect of the UK leaving the European Union's (EU) single market and customs union, she said: ""Economic analysis says that it will cost every person in Scotland Â£1,600"". The single market is the agreement between EU countries that provides for free movement of people, goods, services and capital, while also having the same regulations about things like food safety, transport and packaging. The customs union is an agreement to have no taxes charged on trade between EU countries, while charging the same taxes on things coming from outside the bloc. The figure came from aScottish government assessment,externalin January 2018 (before either Theresa May's or Boris Johnson's deals). It estimated that leaving the single market and customs union would mean Scotland's GDP (the value of the total output of the country) would be 6.1% lower by 2030 than it would have been if the UK had stayed in the EU. It predicted that would knock Â£9bn off Scottish output (in 2016 pounds), which it divided by the population of Scotland to get about Â£1,600 per person. So it's saying that GDP per person would be Â£1,600 lower than it would otherwise have been in 11 years, but that's not the same as costing each individual Â£1,600. GDP includes other things like company profits, some of which could go to shareholders outside Scotland. GDP per head does feed into average income, but it is not necessarily on a one-to-one basis. To be clear, almost all economic analysis predicts that, over this sort of time period, leaving the customs union and the single market would mean GDP would be lower than it would have been if the UK had stayed in the EU. But the Â£1,600 per person figure is unhelpful. You can read more about this from the BBC's Scotland economics editor Douglas Fraserhere. The first minister also said: ""We have the best performing accident and emergency services anywhere in the United Kingdom."" Health is a devolved power, and each nation expects 95% of patients to be treated or admitted in four hours. Nicola Sturgeon is right to say that performance against this target was better in Scotland than in the rest of the UK in 2018-19 - when 91.2% of patients were treated or admitted in that time - but Scotland still missed its target. The figure compares with 88% in England, 80% in Wales and 69.9% Northern Ireland. Scotland is also the most recent nation to have hit the target, which it achieved in the summer of 2017.

What Facebook's ad archive reveals about the campaign so far,"Posting on social media is a great way for a party to get its message to supporters. But how do you reach a new audience beyond those friends and followers? That's where paid-for advertising comes in. By paying for an advert the parties can put their message in front of a specific audience. This way they can reach those who are outside the circle of people sharing political memes and news with their friends and followers. Following controversy about ads it displayed during the 2016 US Presidential election campaign and the UK's EU referendum, Facebook committed to more transparency over political adverts on its platforms. The result isFacebook's Ad Library,external, which allows anyone to see the paid-for political content posted on Facebook and Instagram. So what does the data in the Ad Library tell us about the first week of campaign advertising? Parties can choose to show adverts to people in specific locations but the only location data provided in the Ad Library is at a national level - e.g. Scotland. We know some of the places the Conservatives and the Brexit Party have been targeting, because they told us in the adverts themselves. The Conservative Party has been running a group of 30 almost identical paid-for adverts but each one focuses on a different constituency, showing the number of votes that would have won the Conservatives the seat at the last election. The Brexit Party also have an advert where we can definitely identify the constituency - Barking, in Essex, which they are saying the Conservatives have never won. There are also adverts that appear to be targeted by location but because they just talk about ""here"", it's not possible to know where exactly. Labour have run adverts saying ""The Liberal Democrats can't win here"", which are clearly aimed at voters in a certain towns or cities. Plus, there will be other adverts which are likely being targeted by location with no clue in the content. Parties can also choose who their paid-for adverts are shown to by gender and age. The Ad Library provides a breakdown for each advert. An advert by the Labour party showing how the Facebook provides age and gender data about who has been shown an advert. This week the adverts showing the strongest bias for age and gender were mostly aimed at men. The Brexit Party have published two videos criticising Boris Johnson's Brexit deal. Both are being shown much more to men over the age of 45 than they are to women or young people. If you are under the age of 25, there is very little chance you would have seen either of these videos. At the other extreme, the Conservatives released a video which was seen more than 100,000 times in the first 24 hours and was only shown to men under the age of 35. According to the data on Facebook this ad has not been seen by any women or anyone over the age of 35. The Liberal Democrats have run a group of ads with a variety of slogans attacking Jeremy Corbyn which was shown mostly to middle-aged men. They've also put out  another set promising skills and training opportunities, again with a strong bias towards men. On the other hand, Plaid Cymru, in Wales, ran an advert promising free social care, and seen mostly by women over the age of 45. But for most adverts, across the board, the picture is more mixed. Some are being seen more by men than women or shown to an older rather than younger audience. The Labour Party hasn't yet run any adverts which are so sharply targeted; a fundraising advert leaned a little towards men, an anti-fracking one slightly towards women. Other parties, such as the SNP and the Green Party, have not, at the time of writing, paid for any ads since the start of the campaign. It appears the political parties have far fewer adverts compared with the number of posts appearing on their official accounts and most of the paid-for content is on Facebook and Instagram. Twitter has announced that it will be banning political ads from the 21 November. But in fact there have been virtually no paid-for tweets on Twitter by political parties in the UK over the past week. Instead the parties are focusing on getting re-tweets from their followers. It's the same on Snap and YouTube, with very limited if any spending by the parties. How we collect and analyse the data We used Facebook's ad library to analyse all currently active political ads funded by the major UK parties. This includes ads run by parties' main Facebook pages, party leaders' pages, and national party pages for Scotland and Wales. Ads are only included in the library if they have been flagged by the advertiser as being about social issues, politics or elections. All political parties in the UK would be expected to flag their paid content. Information about major UK party campaigns correct as of 7 November.

Crossrail delayed until 2021 as costs increase,"Latest projections indicate an further Â£400m to Â£650m will be needed to complete the project, Crossrail Ltd said The opening of London's Crossrail project will be delayed until 2021 as Europe's biggest infrastructure scheme is set to go another Â£650m over budget. The route, to be known as the Elizabeth Line, was originally due to open in December 2018. Crossrail Ltd chief executive Mark Wild said services would be delayed to allow time for more testing. He also said the cost of the project could reach Â£18.25bn, more than Â£2bn more than the original budget. The Department for Transport said it was ""considering"" where this new funding would come from. The cost was originally set at Â£15.9bn for the scheme, which will connect major landmarks such as Heathrow Airport and the Canary Wharf business district. However, Mayor Sadiq Khan, the government and Transport for London (TfL) had since agreed a figure of Â£17.6bn. Bosses said in April that services would begin between October 2020 and March 2021. Announcing the latest delay, Mr Wild insisted services would begin ""as soon as practically possible in 2021"". He added: ""The central section will be substantially complete by the end of the first quarter in 2020, except for Bond Street and Whitechapel stations where work will continue. ""We will provide Londoners with further certainty about when the Elizabeth line will open early in 2020."" The delay will allow more time to complete software development and allow safety systems to be tested. By Tom Edwards, BBC London transport correspondent Just weeks agoI spoke to businesses up and down the Crossrail lineand there was very little confidence with anything they were being told by the company. Well they were right. We are getting a drip-drip of delay and uncertainty. Crossrail's hopeful ""opening window"" of between October 2020 and March 2021 just got slammed shut. Now it'll open ""as soon as possible in 2021"". And then there's the extra cost. I suspect that will again come from London businesses through the precept, which was meant to be earmarked for other transport projects like the second phase of Crossrail. Yes, this will be an incredible project when it's finished. But at the moment businesses will despair. The line will make use of some existing track, but involves 26 miles of new tunnels connecting Paddington and Liverpool Street stations to improve rail capacity crossing the capital. Eventually it will connect London to Reading and Shenfield. Mike Cherry, chair of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the delay to the service is ""fast-becoming a national embarrassment"". He said: ""Another delay to Crossrail is disappointing to see and will leave a sour taste in the mouths of businesses and commuters who had been preparing for the start of the service in 2020."" Mr Khan said he was ""deeply frustrated"" by the new delay. A spokesman for the Mayor said ""Further work is taking place immediately to assess Crossrail's latest cost estimates. ""TfL and the Department for Transport, as joint sponsors, will continue to hold the Crossrail leadership to account to ensure it is doing everything it can to open Crossrail safely and as soon as possible."" The Elizabeth Line had been due to open in December 2018 An estimated 200 million passengers will use the new underground line annually, increasing central London rail capacity by 10% - the largest increase since World War Two. Crossrail says the new line will connect Paddington to Canary Wharf in 17 minutes. In May,Crossrail was criticised by the National Audit Officefor running late and over budget, suggesting that bosses had clung to an unrealistic opening date. A TfL spokesman called the delay ""disappointing"". In a statement it said: ""It is only over the last year that the new Crossrail leadership has established the full complexity of finishing the software development and signalling systems, while getting the necessary safety approvals to complete the railway. ""Full testing is due to get under way next year and there can be no shortcuts on this hugely complex project.""

Backlash over Japan 'glasses ban' for female staff,"Wearing glasses at work has become an emotive topic in Japan following reports that some firms have told female employees to remove them. Several local news outlets said some companies had ""banned"" eyewear for female employees for various reasons. Among them, some retail chains reportedly said glasses-wearing shop assistants gave a ""cold impression"". That has sparked heated discussion on Japanese social media over dress practices and women in the workplace. The Nippon TV network and Business Insider were among the outlets to report on the issue, which looked at how firms in different industries prohibit women from wearing glasses. They included safety reasons for airline workers, or being unable to see make-up properly for women working in the beauty sector. Goldman Sachs relaxes staff dress code It was not clear whether the so-called ""bans"" were based on company policies, or rather reflected what was socially accepted practice in those workplaces. But the topic has led to heated debates on social media. The hashtag ""glasses are forbidden"" has been popular in Japan and the topic continued to attract tweets on Friday. Kumiko Nemoto, professor of sociology at Kyoto University of Foreign Studies, said people in Japan were reacting to the ""outdated"" policies. She said: ""The reasons why women are not supposed to wear glasses... really don't make sense. It's all about gender. It's pretty discriminatory."" She added that the reports reflected ""old, traditional Japanese"" thinking. ""It's not about how women do their work. The company... values the women's appearance as being feminine and that's opposite to someone who wears glasses,"" Prof Nemoto said. The discussion has echoes of a recent workplace controversy in Japan over high heels. Actor and writer Yumi Ishikawa launched a petition calling for Japan to end dress codesafter being made to wear high heels while working at a funeral parlour. The movement attracted a stream of support and a strong social media following. Supporters tweeted the petition alongside the hashtag #KuToo in solidarity with her cause, mirroring the #MeToo movement against sexual abuse. The slogan plays on the Japanese words for shoes ""kutsu"" and pain ""kutsuu"". Yumi Ishikawa submitted her petition to the Japanese government in June Campaigners say that wearing high heels is seen as obligatory when applying for jobs. Supporters were further aggravated after aJapanese minister said it is ""necessary"" for companies to enforce dress codesthat mandated high heels. Prof Nemoto said there continues to be discussion by women in Japan ""criticising the high heel"" policies. ""Women are evaluated mostly on their appearance,"" she said. ""That's the message that these policies are sending, at least."" Have you ever been told what to wear or not to wear at work? You can share your experience by emailingkatie.hope@bbc.co.uk,external.

"No checks on goods between NI and GB, says PM","This video can not be played ""There will not be checks on goods going from NI to GB,"" Boris Johnson tells Conservative supporters Prime Minister Boris Johnson has briefed Conservative Party members in Northern Ireland on his Brexit deal. The Brexit deal has major implications for Northern Ireland. The region will continue to follow many EU rules on food and other manufactured goods, while the rest of the UK will not. Northern Ireland will still be part of the UK's customs territory but it will also continue to follow EU customs rules. That is likely to mean new bureaucracy for trade between Northern  Ireland and the rest of the UK. A clip of the briefing has been widely shared on social media. So did Boris Johnson get all the details correct? That is a long-standing UK government policy. In 2017, it promised that Northern Ireland companies would continue to have ""unfettered access"" to the rest of the UK, no matter what the Brexit outcome. Brexit Secretary Stephen Barclay has previously said there would be ""limited targeted interventions"" on trade from Northern Ireland into Great Britain. Last month Mr Barclaysaid goods going from Northern Ireland to Great Britain would be subject to exit declarations. He said that would amount to the filing of an electronic form, involving ""fairly straightforward data"". Last month Stephen Barclay said goods going from NI to GB would be subject to exit declarations. The question then arises whether checks would ever have to be carried out to verify the accuracy of what is on the form. The prime minister says no but many trade experts are sceptical about whether a policy of no checks could be maintained in the long term. However, the precise details of how it would all work are yet to be explained. That is highly unlikely - when it comes to checks. The deal means that Northern Ireland will remain part of a ""single regulatory zone"" with the Republic of Ireland, a zone that will apply EU rules. The EU has particularly strict rules on the importation of ""products of animal origin"" - that is to say meat, fish and dairy products. Those products must enter the EU through a border inspection post where all shipments are subject to document checks and a high proportion are physically checked. Products of animal origin from Great Britain entering Northern Ireland would be subject to these checks whether they are destined for Northern Ireland or the Republic of Ireland. A few countries, such as New Zealand, have a deal with the EU where only 1% of consignments are checked. It is possible that the UK could negotiate a similar deal but it would not be able to eliminate checks entirely unless the whole of the UK was going to stay in the single market. The current political declaration, which sets out the broad shape of the future EU-UK relationship, suggests that is unlikely. There is a second issue to do with tariffs. Goods which enter Northern Ireland from Great Britain and which are to be consumed in Northern Ireland will not have tariffs charged. However, some classes of goods which are deemed ""at risk"" of being moved onward to the Republic of Ireland or the wider EU could be subject to tariffs. If those goods are shown to have been consumed in Northern Ireland then the tariff can be rebated. The definition of ""at risk"" and the rebate system will have to be negotiated during the post-Brexit transition period. It is not completely clear what the prime minister means by ""free movement"" in this context. Free movement of people is one of the core principles of the EU. It gives all citizens of EU countries the right to travel, live and work wherever they wish within the EU. The government has promised to end free movement and that will also apply in Northern Ireland. It seems that Mr Johnson was referring to the continuation of the Common Travel Area after Brexit. It is an arrangement between the UK and Ireland that pre-dates the formation of the EU. It allows passport-free travel between the UK and Ireland and gives British and Irish citizens a range of rights in each other's countries. On the single market, it is correct that Northern Ireland will have better access to the EU's single market for goods compared to the rest of the UK. However, that does not extend to the single market for services.

"Vietnamese lorry death victims namedTen teenagers, including two 15-year-old boys, were among the 39 people found dead in a lorry.Essex","Pham Thi Tra My, 26, and Nguyen Dinh Luong, 20, were among the victims The names of all 39 Vietnamese nationals who were found dead in a refrigerated lorry in Essex have been released by police. Ten teenagers, including two 15-year-old boys, were among the victims. Their bodies were found in a lorry trailer in an industrial park in Grays on 23 October. Essex coroner Caroline Beasley-Murray said: ""May I take this opportunity to offer my deepest condolences to the victims' families."" Assistant Chief Constable Tim Smith said: ""This was an incredibly important process and our team has been working hard to bring answers to worried families who fear their loved one may be among those whose tragic journey ended on our shores. ""Our priority has been to identify the victims, to preserve the dignity of those who have died and to support the victims' friends and families."" Bui Thi Nhung, 19, from Nghe An province, was also found dead in the lorry The bodies were discovered in a lorry trailer in the early hours of 23 October Pham Thi Tra My, 26, sent her family a message on the night of 22 October - the day before the 39 people were found dead - saying she could not breathe and her ""trip to a foreign land has failed"". Le Minh Tuan, the father of 30-year-old Le Van Ha, who comes from an agricultural part of Vietnam, previously told the BBC he was convinced his son was among the dead. By Danny Shaw, BBC home affairs correspondent The process of identifying those who died in the container has taken just over two weeks. An Identification Commission, overseen by the coroner for Essex, used fingerprints, DNA, dental records and distinctive body markings such as tattoos and scars to confirm the victims' names. Most of those who died were in their 20s and 30s; there were 10 teenagers; and two were in their early 40s. Eight were women. All the victims came from central or northern Vietnam. Police say the authorities are now discussing arrangements for the bodies to be repatriated. The bodies were found on the Waterglade Industrial Estate in a container which had been shipped to nearby Purfleet from Zeebrugge in Belgium. Lorry driver Maurice Robinson, from Northern Ireland, has appeared in court charged with offences including 39 counts of manslaughter. Extradition proceedings have also begun against 22-year-old Eamonn Harrison, who was arrested in Dublin on a European Arrest Warrant. Police are also seeking two brothers from Northern Ireland, Ronan and Christopher Hughes, who are wanted on suspicion of manslaughter and people trafficking.

Cairns refuses to give details on rape trial rowThe ex-Welsh Secretary declines to answer questions about a row that led him to quit on Wednesday.Wales politics,"This video can not be played The ex-Welsh secretary declines to answer questions about a row that led him to quit A former minister has refused to answer questions on when he knew his former aide had ""sabotaged"" a rape trial, in his first interview since the story broke. Alun Cairns, who resigned as Welsh secretary on Wednesday, said he was ""determined to clear his name"". His former aide was selected as an assembly candidate eight monthsafter the trial collapsed. Mr Cairns is facing pressure to quit as a general election candidate. His former colleague Ross England told a rape trial in April 2018 that he had been in a casual sexual relationship with the victim - claims the victim had denied. He was thrown out of court by the judge, who had ruled such evidence inadmissible, and the trial collapsed. The defendant James Hackett was subsequently convicted of rape at a retrial. Mr Cairns had denied he knew about the trial's collapse until last week, but resigned after BBC Wales obtained an email addressed to him discussing the case - it had been sent in August 2018. Timeline: Alun Cairns' resignation What does Alun Cairns' resignation mean? Prime minister backs rape trial row ex-minister Asked how he reconciled the differences between the statement and the email, Mr Cairns said: ""This is a highly sensitive situation, and I've taken this seriously throughout."" Alun Cairn, standing with his mother Maragret (L) and his wife Emma (R), said he is ""determined to clear his name"" Interviewed with his mother Margaret and his wife Emma by his side, the politician said: ""The party hasmade a statementthat has expressed sympathy to the victim. That is something I would absolutely fully support"". ""Now it's important to realise that I had nothing, no association in anyway with the trial and that I've stood aside as the secretary of state for Wales in order to give the cabinet office the space they need to fully look at all of the facts so they can come to a conclusion and a judgement. ""I'm keen to get on with the campaign of the general election. Of course people will judge all of the facts rather than trial by media."" Asked by BBC Wales if he would stick to what he had said previously, he said: ""There is a due process"", referring to an investigation that will be carried out by the cabinet office. He said Mr England ""left my employment some 13 months before the trial"", and that he had ""no communication from the court or the judge"". This video can not be played Boris Johnson denied his general election campaign had been thrown off course by a rape trial row It was put to Mr Cairns that BBC Wales had spoken to sources within the Conservative Party who had been aware of the matter. Asked why he did not know about the situation if they did, he repeated his argument. ""Let the cabinet office look at all of the evidence, let them take into account all of the facts, and they will make the judgement rather than be faced by trial by media,"" he said. Mr Cairns then left the interview. Criticising the comments, a Welsh Conservative source said: ""We can't go on for the next five weeks with this hanging over the party with the constant flow of damaging interviews like we've seen today"". Ross England has been suspended as a candidate for the Vale of Glamorgan at the assembly election Mr Cairns resigned from the cabinet following the publication of the email earlier this week. Labour, Plaid Cymru and the Liberal Democrats have called for Mr Cairns to quit as a general election candidate,as has the rape victim at the centre of the case. The email message on 2 August 2018 was sent to Mr Cairns by Geraint Evans, his special adviser. It was also copied to Richard Minshull - the director of the Welsh Conservatives - and another member of staff. It said: ""I have spoken to Ross and he is confident no action will be taken by the court."" In December 2018, the former Welsh secretary endorsed Mr England's candidacy to represent the Vale of Glamorgan in the 2021 Welsh assembly election. At the time of his selection to stand as an AM, Mr Cairns described Mr England as a ""friend and colleague"" with whom ""it will be a pleasure to campaign"". Mr England was suspended as a candidate and as an employee last week after details of the court case emerged. The Welsh Conservative party said a ""full investigation will be conducted"". Other candidates standing in the Vale of Glamorgan for the 12 December general election include Belinda Loveluck-Edwards for Welsh Labour and Anthony Slaughter for the Wales Green Party. The close of nominations is 14 November. Prime minister backs rape trial row ex-minister What does Alun Cairns' resignation mean?

Fake rhino horn invented to ruin poachers' market,"Scientists have developed a technique for making fake rhino horn, which they hope will undermine the illegal market in the genuine article. Researchers at the University of Oxford and Fudan University in China have found a way of making fake rhino horn cheaply from horse hair. Demand for rhino horn has been blamed for driving poaching and threatening the survival of the species. The Oxford team said the fakes would ""confuse the trade"". But there has been some scepticism about whether this will be effective - with Save the Rhino International warning it could inadvertently stimulate the market for rhino horn. The conservation charity says it is more important to focus on anti-poaching measures and attempts to reduce consumer demand. Rhino horn has been claimed as an aphrodisiac in traditional Chinese medicine - which has sustained demand despite official attempts to prevent the trade. This joint UK and Chinese project is the latest attempt to find a way of making artificial horn that is realistic enough to be convincing, with the aim of flooding the market with fakes and undermining the financial incentives for poachers and smugglers. There have been previous ideas for fake horn, but this project wants a credible version that can be cheaply mass-produced. Creating fake horn is intended to reduce the financial incentive for rhino poachers The scientists say the ""horn"" of a rhino is not like the horn of a cow, but is formed from tufts of tightly packed hair that are glued together by secretions from the animal. And the team of zoologists in Oxford and molecular scientists in Fudan University in Shanghai have developed a way of compressing and moulding horse hair in a way that looks and feels similar even when the ""horn"" is cut. If credible fakes could be produced cheaply, the scientists say it would cut prices and reduce the incentive for killing the rhinos. ""It appears from our investigation that it is rather easy as well as cheap to make a bio-inspired horn-like material that mimics the rhino's extravagantly expensive tuft of nose hair,"" said Prof Fritz Vollrath, from the University of Oxford's Department of Zoology. He said he hoped the technique could be used to ""confuse the trade, depress prices and thus support rhino conservation"". But John Taylor, deputy director of Save the Rhino International, is unconvinced how much fake horn would reduce the threat to rhinos. He says there is a risk that attempts to ""flood the market"" would have the unintended consequence of expanding the market and creating even more demand, which could cause even more poaching for real rhino horn. He also questions how in practice fake horn could be inserted into an illegal black market trade. Mr Taylor is not certain that artificial horn would really convince two of the main markets - where it is ground up for traditional Chinese medicine and where wild rhino horn is used as a status symbol, particularly in Vietnam. ""There is no substitute for anti-poaching measures at one end and reducing demand at the other,"" he says.

"Cost of girl's 200-mile trips for cancer treatmentElin Rowlands, 13, is still travelling from Anglesey to Liverpool and Manchester for tests.Wales","This video can not be played Â£600 a month to travel for cancer treatment Parents of a child who has to make 200-mile round trips for cancer treatment are calling for more help with the costs of travel. Elin Rowlands, 13, from Anglesey, was diagnosed with leukaemia in 2013 and had to travel to Liverpool's Alder Hey hospital to get specialist treatment. Elin's mother said it cost them between Â£35 and Â£40 for each return trip. The Welsh Government said some families are eligible to claim for travel costs if they meet certain criteria. There is a specialist cancer unit for young people in Cardiff but there is no service for those further north. Alison Rowlands gave up work to care for her daughter Elin and said she had to depend on friends for financial help when their car broke down. Mrs Rowlands toldNewyddion 9: ""At the start it was very scary... you don't think about the journey right, it's get your daughter there, get her better. ""It's then as the treatment goes on, that it's 'oh my goodness, I've got to go there a lot'. ""We were spending roughly Â£35 to Â£40 each trip to go there and come back and most of them were day trips, and there's a lot of them. ""We stayed there quite a lot in the beginning, but then we had to go back about four times a week. Elin, pictured with her mother, suffered a relapse last year ""You had to look at the diary constantly, what time are we going? When do we need to set off? Have we got petrol in the car? ""My husband drove most of the time, but because of his job he couldn't do it all the time. ""I wouldn't like to imagine how much I've spent on the fuel in that amount of time. ""You worry enough about your daughter going through this horrible treatment without having to worry where the money's going to come to put petrol in the car."" Boy's 'neck pain' was rare throat cancer 'Why me? I had ovarian cancer at 14' Teenage cancer patient aims to promote body image Mrs Rowlands said the local community pulled together and collected ""a really good amount of money"" they were able to spend on fuel. ""If the government did decide to help out with families, that would be amazing - until you go through something like this, you have no idea whatsoever."" Elin relapsed in January 2018 and needed a bone marrow transplant, but had to be transferred to a unit in Manchester. She still travels to Liverpool and Manchester for tests, but no longer needs treatment. Alder Hey children's hospital cares for over 330,000 young people every year Richard Pugh, from the Wales Cancer Alliance, is also backing the calls for more support: ""The cost ramifications are huge because those specialist services aren't that local. ""You've got to travel. Unless you're in Cardiff and those services are right on your doorstep."" The charity CLIC Sargent estimated Elin's family would spend on average Â£600 a month on travel costs. The charity want the Welsh Government to create a Â£250,000 annual travel fund, to help families pay for travel costs. Mr Pugh said: ""What we'd like to see is a travel fund for young people affected by cancer so they don't have that financial burden."" Richard Pugh said ""in an ideal world"" there would be multiple treatment units across the country The Teenage Cancer Trust unit at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff is the only specialist unit for young people with cancer in Wales. Ashley Bassett, 23, from Pencoed, Bridgend, was diagnosed with leukaemia when he was studying for his GCSEs and visited the unit. ""This unit is very important. It's a place I can come and relax. It's a nice environment. There's a pool table, TV and games,"" he said. ""There's opportunities to try and be as normal as you can in hospital, because hospitals aren't the place to be sometimes, but this unit makes it much more bearable. ""It's unfortunate that people live too far away to come here for treatment."" Cancer survival improvements slow down Breast cancer taboo 'can cause isolation' Fast cancer checks urged for north Wales Mr Pugh said ""in an ideal world"" there would be multiple units across Wales. ""Unfortunately, our workforce isn't in the condition it should be to do that,"" he said. Ashley Bassett said the support unit he used has a ""nice environment"" ""We're at a real cusp of some massive issues with our workforce, not just for children but across the board. ""So we need to make sure that we get the support for patients in the right location, at the right time. At this time, it does mean travelling."" The Welsh Government said some families can be eligible to claim for travel costs if they meet certain criteria, such as claiming benefits. A spokesperson said: ""Families can be eligible to claim help for travel costs from the NHS if their child has to go to hospital for NHS treatment. ""We are committed to the provision of excellent care for children and young people but recognise that this may require families to travel outside of their health board area. ""While we appreciate the impact this has on families, it is also important to ensure that children and young people can receive expert care for what are often complex conditions from a sustainable service.""

Nicola Sturgeon's SNP campaign speech fact-checked,"Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has launched the Scottish National Party's election campaign in Edinburgh. She made a few claims worth looking at - the first was about the potential impact of Brexit on Scotland. Talking about the prospect of the UK leaving the European Union's (EU) single market and customs union, she said: ""Economic analysis says that it will cost every person in Scotland Â£1,600"". The single market is the agreement between EU countries that provides for free movement of people, goods, services and capital, while also having the same regulations about things like food safety, transport and packaging. The customs union is an agreement to have no taxes charged on trade between EU countries, while charging the same taxes on things coming from outside the bloc. The figure came from aScottish government assessment,externalin January 2018 (before either Theresa May's or Boris Johnson's deals). It estimated that leaving the single market and customs union would mean Scotland's GDP (the value of the total output of the country) would be 6.1% lower by 2030 than it would have been if the UK had stayed in the EU. It predicted that would knock Â£9bn off Scottish output (in 2016 pounds), which it divided by the population of Scotland to get about Â£1,600 per person. So it's saying that GDP per person would be Â£1,600 lower than it would otherwise have been in 11 years, but that's not the same as costing each individual Â£1,600. GDP includes other things like company profits, some of which could go to shareholders outside Scotland. GDP per head does feed into average income, but it is not necessarily on a one-to-one basis. To be clear, almost all economic analysis predicts that, over this sort of time period, leaving the customs union and the single market would mean GDP would be lower than it would have been if the UK had stayed in the EU. But the Â£1,600 per person figure is unhelpful. You can read more about this from the BBC's Scotland economics editor Douglas Fraserhere. The first minister also said: ""We have the best performing accident and emergency services anywhere in the United Kingdom."" Health is a devolved power, and each nation expects 95% of patients to be treated or admitted in four hours. Nicola Sturgeon is right to say that performance against this target was better in Scotland than in the rest of the UK in 2018-19 - when 91.2% of patients were treated or admitted in that time - but Scotland still missed its target. The figure compares with 88% in England, 80% in Wales and 69.9% Northern Ireland. Scotland is also the most recent nation to have hit the target, which it achieved in the summer of 2017.

Record bushfire emergencies hit Australian state,"This video can not be played ""Unprecedented"" bushfires turn skies orange Australian authorities say an ""unprecedented"" number of emergency-level bushfires are threatening the state of New South Wales (NSW). More than 80 blazes were raging across the state on Friday. Gusty winds and up to 35C heat have exacerbated the fires, many of which are in drought-affected areas. There are reports of people trapped in their homes in several places, with crew unable to reach them due to the strength of the fires. Early Australian bushfires 'an omen for summer' Climate emergency 'clear and unequivocal' ""We are in uncharted territory,"" said Rural Fire Service Commissioner Shane Fitzsimmons. ""We have never seen this many fires concurrently at emergency warning level."" At one point, 17 emergency-level fires were burning simultaneously across NSW. But fire authorities said that falling temperatures, increases in humidity and helicopter assistance were helping with efforts to tackle the blazes. Authorities have deployed more than 1,000 firefighters and 70 aircraft to save ""as many people as possible"", Mr Fitzsimmons said. The Rural Fire Service tweeted on Friday that""due to the size and speed of the fires we couldn't get to everyone, even by road or helicopter"",external. The blazes are spread across about 1,000 km (621 miles) of Australia's coast, stretching the emergency response. Some people were warned to seek shelter from fires rather than flee, as it was now too late to leave. Emergency warnings were also issued on Friday for bushfires burning in Queensland and Western Australia. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

In NSW, the worst-hit state, crews have fought hundreds of fires since September. Last month, two people died while trying to protect their home. Last week, one blaze burned though 2,000 hectares of bush which contained a koala sanctuary.Hundreds of the animals were feared to have died. More than half the koalas living at another sanctuary may have also been killed by wildfires, according to charity Koala Conservation Australia. The fires have affected both inland and coastal areas in the state's north-east An aircraft drops fire retardant near the town of Forster Wildlife rescuers were able to save some injured koalas from a deadly fire Rains lashed NSW earlier this week, providing much relief to farmers. But the storms were not nearly enough to end the long-running drought. Authorities in the state warn that many fires will continue to burn unless there is more rain. ""We just cannot overstate the profound impact that the drought is having on fire behaviour,"" Mr Fitzsimmons said. Farmers - Australia's 'unlikely' climate activists Living with the strain of a devastating drought Water-bombing aircraft are often flying long distances because of the difficulty of accessing water in dry areas. In some cases authorities have drilled bores to keep up with demand. ""We've very mindful of the scarcity of water and how precious it is but the reality is we can't do firefighting without water,"" Mr Fitzsimmons said. Strong northerly winds shrouded Sydney in smoke from the bushfires The haze obscured the city's most famous landmarks Last week, Sydney was blanketed by smoke for days due to fires in Port Macquarie - a region 380km away. The poor air quality prompted health warnings for those with asthma and other respiratory problems. Australia's fire season risks growing longer and more intense due to climate change, according to scientists. Authorities said they were concerned about the severity of the fires ahead of its hottest months, a year afterthe nation experienced its warmest summer on record.

'I pawned my nan's jewellery for a dating scammer',"Dating apps should do more to verify users to help prevent romance fraud, the Victims' Commissioner has said. The BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme spoke to victims of a man who was jailed for conning 19 women out of Â£24,000. ""He started to say he was at my house. 'You better call me quick, I'm here, nice house, nice steps. When that money is paid we'll be out of each other's lives. If not, things will get nasty.'"" Chloe - not her real name - met Ivan Nkazi through a dating app where he posed using the fake name Lancel. He conned her using a well-practised tactic before they even met - saying he was stuck at a petrol station and had an issue with payment for his fuel. He then claimed the petrol station staff were racist and police were attending. In just one day, Chloe gave him almost Â£600 - but he wanted more. ""I said, 'No, I have no more. I can't, I'm a single mother of two children on my own,'"" she says. ""He became malicious, hurtful, quite personal."" Nkazi, 31, from Liverpool, ran his scams like a business for almost four years via dating sites like Tinder and Plenty of Fish. He used a detailed index system to keep track of the stories he told women to ensure he never made a mistake. Ivan Nkazi posed as two different men to scam Chloe Several days later he scammed Chloe for a second time, posing as a man called Mallah who texted her from an unknown number. She was suspicious but told him about her previous experience of losing the money. Nkazi then messaged using his original fake name, saying he had been attacked because she had shared this information with this second man. ""Within minutes, I had a barrage of text messages asking for more money, and that's when the really nasty threats started,"" she says. ""I was shaking like a leaf. I was frightened of being in trouble with the police which is what stopped me telling them in the first place."" Feeling she had no other choice, she pawned jewellery inherited from her grandmother for Â£600 and borrowed a further Â£400, taking the total amount he scammed from her to Â£1,600. The Victoria Derbyshire programme has spoken to five of his 19 victims - many of them were vulnerable, others simply thought they were doing a good deed, but the impact of the scam has been long-lasting. ""He played on the vulnerability elements because he knew I was looking for a loving, meaningful relationship,"" Chloe says, reflecting on his approach. ""He suggested to me that he was [looking for that] as well and it made me want to help him more."" Nkazi's victims are not alone. Latest figures from City of London Police show from August 2018 to July 2019 there were 5,756 reports of romance fraud compared with 3,209 in 2014-15 - a 79% increase. Dame Vera Baird says there needs to be more targeted support for romance fraud The Victims' Commissioner Dame Vera Baird now says dating apps should take more responsibility for verifying users. ""There should be a register of people who have been convicted of romance fraud, similar to Clare's Law,"" she said, referring to the system that allows those in fear of domestic violence to ask police for information. ""And there needs to be a more targeted line of victim support to cater to victims of romance fraud."" Criminals who commit romance fraud trawl through profiles and piece together information such as wealth and lifestyle, in order to manipulate their victims Police can investigate and help to provide support, but often cannot get the money back It is very simple for fraudsters to cover their tracks by masking IP addresses and using unregistered phone numbers Never send money to someone online you have never met Think twice about posting personal information which could be used to manipulate or bribe you Source: Action Fraud,external In August, Nkazi was sentenced to three years in jail after pleading guilty to 11 counts of fraud and four counts of malicious communications. Det Sgt Chris Hawitt led the investigation and thinks it is ""entirely possible"" there are more victims. ""It's a particularly horrible crime because it's indiscriminate. He targeted women of all professions, all levels of education, all backgrounds,"" he said. ""Unfortunately these women didn't mean anything to him other than a source of income. And in one case he unfortunately threatened to throw acid in their face if they didn't comply with his demands."" Nkazi has also been given a five-year serious crime prevention order which means he cannot use dating apps without telling the police his usernames. But Chloe says that does not give her any comfort, saying he will just pose as new people. She remains scared of him. ""If he could describe my house, could he revisit it? He frightened me that much I'm concerned about the future when he's released."" Follow the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme onFacebook,externalandTwitter,external- and see more of our storieshere.

Dozens sleep at shopping centre,"Some shops stayed open late while Carphone Warehouse reportedly let people charge their phones Dozens of people have spent the night in a shopping centre in Sheffield after torrential downpours flooded the city's streets. People bedded down on benches and chairs in the Meadowhall centre, while others tried throughout the night to get home in cars or taxis. Amajor incident was declared in Sheffieldas rain continued overnight. Elsewhere, in Rotherham firefighters rescued people by boat who were stranded in the Parkgate centre. People are being told to evacuate their homes in the villages of Old Kirk Sandall and Sandal Grove near Doncaster after the River Don burst its banks. There are three severe flood warnings - meaning a danger to life - in place along the River Don. More than 100 flood warnings remain in place,,externalmostly in the north of England, with the rain causing serious disruption to roads and rail services. Flooding in Yorkshire: Latest updates East Midlands flooding: Latest updates The Environment Agency said a number of high volume pumps were being used to move water away from homes in Catcliffe in Rotherham. Sheffield City Council said several major roads from Derbyshire to Sheffield remained closed. The fire service pulled people to safety from the Parkgate centre Earlier on Thursday,35 homes in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, were evacuatedafter a mudslide caused by torrential rain. In Sheffield, hundreds of people - including those attending the Christmas Live event, which was cancelled - were kept inside Meadowhall centre by police after the surrounding streets were flooded. The centre later reopened but many people chose to stay overnight, after being unable to get home. The floodwater surrounding Meadowhall shopping centre, just off the M1 Disney Store worker Jodie Whelan, 23, stayed at the centre, where she said staff were handing out free drinks and trying to arrange taxis. She said she travelled in for her shift by bus but said getting back was ""an absolute no-go"". ""I'm feeling very tired,"" she added. ""A bit fed up but trying to make the best out of an awful situation. The atmosphere is very weird but communal. ""Some people got a bit rowdy and it was upsetting seeing some older people and people with babies or children, but thankfully we are all warm and safe."" Shoppers who were unable to get home found comfort where they could Another member of staff, Luke Turner, who works at a restaurant, said he was unable to drive home after his shift so bedded down in the stockroom where he said he could use ""aprons"" as a pillow. ""I've got options, I could have got a taxi home but that still leaves me having to get a taxi back to work tomorrow,"" Mr Turner, from Chesterfield, said. This video can not be played Becky said people 'bought pyjamas from Primark' to make their stay more comfortable ""I had an offer from my higher management that if I could get a hotel room for the night... but unfortunately all the hotel rooms around me are full."" ""There's people in suits sleeping, one guy in a Tesco uniform,"" he added. Meanwhile Charlotte Lowther-Fuller, 18, from Grimsby said she was unable to get to a taxi as the roads and junction were cordoned off. ""It was impossible for him to get us,"" she said, adding: ""I am feeling quite tired, drained and cold from the whole situation and just want to get home as I have college to go to in the morning."" Charlotte Lowther-Fuller and her friend set up camp outside shops before being moved to the dining area Sixth-form student Rosie De Roeck, 16, from Kirkby-in-Ashfield, spent around nine hours in the centre with her friend before her mum managed to rescue her shortly before 01:00 GMT. It was ""horrible"" and ""quite scary"", she said, adding that Primark stayed open late, with her and many others buying pyjamas after getting wet in the rain. She said coffee chain Starbucks gave out free cookies and a man who was also stranded shared a box of crisps he had bought. ""I honestly don't think I'll be able to sleep,"" said Saskia Hazelwood, second from left, who bought pyjamas College student Saskia Hazelwood, 17, from Doncaster, who was stranded with three friends when trains were cancelled, said people were ""stressed, tired and bored"" in the centre. ""My dad tried to drive but he literally couldn't get in,"" she said. ""He tried going up all the back roads, up streets the other way, he couldn't get in."" One man found his car stranded in Sheffield after torrential rain Roads close to Meadowhall were flooded after hours of persistent rainfall A man cycles through a flooded street in Sheffield on Thursday after torrential rain At shortly after midnight, Sheffield City Council declared a major incident, saying there was ""some water"" coming over the top of the River Don's defences, but it was not yet a breach. According to the forecast fromthe Environment Agency,external, the River Don at Doncaster is predicted to reach its highest recorded level later on Friday. Meadowhall shopping centre said it would open as normal on Friday, providing the Environment Agency lifts its flood warning as forecasted. ""Whilst the extreme weather conditions persist, the centre remains dry and secure,"" it said in a statement. 'Biblical' rainfall leaves streets flooded Homes evacuated after mudslide South Yorkshire Police worked through the night to move up to 100 people who were stranded in the Parkgate Shopping Park in Rotherham. Alex Johnson, South Yorkshire's deputy chief fire officer, said additional resources had been brought in from elsewhere in the country - that included five high-volume pumps and five more boat crews. Rotherham Borough Council urged residents to stay at home and not leave unless told to by emergency services.

Labour promises to extend paid maternity leave,"Labour is promising a ""step-change"" in women's working rights if it wins the general election, pledging an increase in the length of statutory maternity pay from nine months to a year. The party also wants managers at large firms to be trained in supporting staff going through the menopause. And it is promising the right to choose flexible working when starting a job. The Conservatives say they would introduce ""responsible reforms"" to get more women into work. Business Secretary Andrea Leadsom said Labour's ""reckless plans would cripple businesses across the country"". Election campaigning is under way ahead of voters going to the polls on 12 December. LIVE: General election campaign latest Gender pay gap progress 'dismally slow' Inequality 'leaving women financially fragile' Employers urged to 'normalise' menopause Shadow women and equalities secretary Dawn Butler said she was ""sick"" of the way women were treated at work, and that concerns had been ignored for ""years"". She added: ""Labour will deliver a workplace revolution to bring about a step-change in how women are treated at work. We'll boost pay, increase flexibility, and strengthen protections against harassment and discrimination."" Currently women on maternity leave are entitled to 90% of average weekly earnings for the first six weeks, then 90% of average weekly earnings or Â£148.68 (whichever is lower) for the next 33 weeks. Labour says it will ensure women continue to get the latter rate for another three months. The party also wants to create a Workers' Protection Agency, with powers to fine businesses that fail to report their gender pay or publish action plans to reduce pay gaps. Figures from the Office for National Statistics indicate that, in the year to April 2019,the gender pay gap for full-time workers was 8.9% in the UK- up from 8.6% the previous year. By law, companies, charities and public sector departments of 250 employees or more must publish their gender pay gap figures. Labour says it wants to lower the threshold to workplaces with more than 50 employees by 2020. Labour says it wants to transform the workplace for women. It's a powerful statement of intent from the party. It's a policy pitched at a large chunk of the electorate. The proposals on maternity pay are obviously designed to appeal to younger women, who want to start or extend a family. But there are also plans for a ""menopause policy"", which will force companies to address the needs of women at a very different stage in their lives. And then there are the measures to reduce the gender pay gap, and create a right to flexible working. That would affect pretty much every female employee. Employers might complain about the bureaucracy and expense involved in much of this - ""the wrong answers to the right questions"" is how the CBI puts it - but there's no question there's a challenge here to the other parties. Labour wants to be seen as the champion of working women. The rival parties will have to find ways to respond. The party has reconfirmed apledge made in Februaryto give workers the right to choose their working hours from the first day in a new job. They can currently request this after 26 weeks in post. Labour also wants companies with more than 250 employees to provide training for line managers on the menopause. At its party conference in September, it said this should include understanding ""what adjustments may be necessary to support"" those going through it and making sure work absence procedures are ""flexible to accommodate menopause as a long-term fluctuating health condition"". And it wants to make employers liable for sexual harassment experienced by staff by ""third parties"", such as clients, require employers to publish their policies and lengthen the timeframe within which employment tribunals can be taken from three months to six months. But Business Secretary Mrs Leadsom said a vote for Labour ""won't solve anything"". ""Only the Conservatives will get Brexit done so we can all move on to focus on people's priorities like making the UK the best place to work and run a business with responsible reforms to increase flexible working, get more women back into work and ensure equality of opportunity regardless of gender, age, race or class,"" she said. Matthew Percival, the CBI's director of people and skills policy, said: ""The CBI has long supported the reintroduction of protection against third-party harassment and the extension of statutory maternity pay to 12 months - which will also support fathers taking shared parental leave."" But he added: ""Needing government approval to set working patterns and company diversity action plans is bureaucratic to the point of being ineffective and unaffordable. ""They are the wrong answers to the right questions. The next government should work with business to develop policies that tackle gender inequality in ways that work for everyone.""

Tory plan to attract more NHS staff from abroad,"The Conservatives say they will make it easier for doctors and nurses from around the world to work in the UK after Brexit, if they win the election. The party would introduce an ""NHS visa"" as part of a promised ""points-based immigration system"". But Labour said the policy was ""full of holes,"" with nothing to say about low-paid nurses and other hospital staff. And the Royal College of Nursing said ""more ambitious"" plans were needed to address NHS staffing shortages. LIVE: General election campaign latest Labour unveils new immigration policy Post-Brexit immigration system unveiled The Conservatives plan to end free movement of workers from EU countries when the UK leaves the EU - something they have promised will happen on 31 January if they are returned to power on 12 December. The party would introduce a ""points-based system"" for migrant workers from EU and non-EU countries. It has yet to spell out in detail how this will work - but it has announced that extra points will be awarded for coming to work in the NHS. The cost of applying for a visa would also be reduced from Â£928 to Â£464 for medical professionals, and they would be guaranteed a decision within two weeks, under Tory plans. Those granted an NHS visa would also be allowed to pay the annual Â£400 compulsory health insurance charge out of their salary. Speaking during a campaign visit to the East Midlands, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said the proposals would make it easier for ""talented"" medical staff to get visas. The Conservatives have already announced a fast-track visa route to attract specialists in science, engineering and technology. They have also previously said they will scrap the cap on the number of skilled workers, such as doctors, from the EU and elsewhere, after Brexit. The party is considering scrapping the minimum salary requirement of Â£30,000 for skilled migrants seeking five-year visas. When asked if there would be more people from overseas working in the UK under a future Conservative government, Home Secretary Priti Patel did not answer directly but said the public wanted ""controlled immigration"". Finding staff from outside the UK to come to work in the health service is as important as ever. But those who wish to do so are often surprised at the fees they have to pay for the privilege. To address this, the Conservatives plan to halve the Â£928 visa cost for NHS staff and their dependents. But the Â£400 surcharge to cover their healthcare costs if they are from outside the EU won't be reduced, nor will the levy paid by the NHS and other employers if they hire foreign workers. So it may be a move in the right direction, but if the health service badly needs trained doctors, nurses and others from abroad, it might be asked why they should pay any fees for visas or healthcare? The Cavendish Coalition, representing a range of health and care organisations, says any steps towards tackling the high vacancy rate are welcome, but by not covering social care the policy is not ambitious enough. These groups want any incoming government to recruit and employ any necessary workers from outside the UK ""without criteria"". The Royal College of Nursing said a failure to train enough nurses was forcing the NHS to ""recruit overseas in the short-term"". RCN chief executive Dame Donna Kinnair said she wanted to see a fairer immigration system that valued skills and did not fixate on ""arbitrary targets"". ""But the devil will be in the detail and we cannot be satisfied by rhetoric alone,"" she said. ""There are tens of thousands of unfilled nursing jobs and we need more ambitious plans than this to address it."" She added it was ""immoral and heartless"" to continue to make nurses contribute towards ""the same services they keep running"" through the health insurance charge. ""It should be abolished, not spread out every month,"" she said. Labour's Diane Abbott accused the Conservatives of using ""dog-whistle anti-migrant rhetoric"" Labour also attacked the lack of detail in the Conservative plans. Shadow home secretary Diane Abbott said: ""The Tories are tying themselves in knots over immigration. They use dog-whistle anti-migrant rhetoric but are forced to accept we need migrant workers for key sectors, not just the NHS, but many more besides. ""This policy is full of holes, with nothing to say about the nurses earning below their income threshold, as well as all the cooks, cleaners, hospital porters and others who are vital to hospitals, and nothing at all about their right to bring family members here. ""Labour's immigration policy is rational and fair and will prioritise attracting the people we need, and treat them as human beings."" Liberal Democrat home affairs spokeswoman Christine Jardine said that, even with the visa application costs reduced for medical professionals, the Â£464 charge still amounted to a ""nurse tax"". More than 12% of the NHS workforce reported their nationality as not British, according toa report published last year,external. The biggest group of foreign NHS workers are from the EU - 56 in every 1,000 - but, the report added, the number of new staff coming from the EU is falling, and that this decline particularly applies to nurses.

Homes evacuated as floods cause travel chaos,"This video can not be played Drone footage filmed from Matlock shows the extent of the floodwater A woman has died after becoming submerged in floodwater as parts of England were deluged with a month's worth of rain in a day. Her body was found hours after she was swept into Derbyshire's River Derwent. Elsewhere, people have been evacuated from their homes as rivers reached record levels in some areas. During a visit to the area, Prime Minister Boris Johnson said: ""We need to prepare and we need to be investing in defences."" The Derwent is expected to peak in Derby city centre at 22:00 GMT, while police have ordered the closure of a main route into the city.

""We saw a little drone go up and the coastguard helicopter came, and that was then circling, hovering over some trees,"" he said. There has been severe flooding in Darley Dale where the woman's body was found The heaviest rainfall on Thursday night was at Swineshaw in the Peak District, which had 112mm (4.4in) in 24 hours. Parts of Sheffield experienced 85mm - just 3mm (0.1in) less than the area's monthly average. More than 100 flood warnings are in place across England. In pictures: Rain floods parts of northern England How do you stop flooding? Dozens sleep at shopping centre amid floods The Environment Agency has issuedsix severe flood warnings,externalfor locations on the River Don. Fran Lowe, from the Environment Agency (EA), urged people to take them seriously ""as they represent a threat to life"". ""Respond immediately and get out of any place affected by a severe flood warning,"" he said. Boris Johnson visited Matlock where he met emergency workers The River Don, which flows through Sheffield, Rotherham and Doncaster, has hit its highest recorded level, at just over 6.3m, higher than it was in 2007 when it also flooded. South Yorkshire Fire and Rescue Service said in the past 28 hours crews rescued more than 120 people, with about 1,200 calls to its control room. In Doncaster: Residents in Yarborough Terrace, in the Bentley area, were rescued by boat as waist-high water filled the street More than 50 people were rescued from static homes at Willow Bridge Caravan Site since the river overtopped In Rotherham: People were told to stay at home and not leave unless asked to do so by the emergency services Firefighters used boats to rescue people who were stranded in the Parkgate shopping centre on Thursday night, with dozens spending the night at the town hall The EA said it was using high-volume pumps to move water away from homes in Catcliffe, one of the areas of greatest concern People were taken to safety in boats in Rotherham While visiting Matlock in Derbyshire, Boris Johnson thanked emergency workers and said he was impressed at how people ""had pulled together"". He said: ""It's businesses particularly who deserve our sympathies and they've had a really tough time. ""You cannot underestimate the psychological effect of flooding on people - it is a big, big blow. ""People have been moved out of their homes and probably hundreds of businesses have seen damage to their properties - we stand ready to help in any way that we can."" Some residents of Yarborough Terrace in Doncaster criticised the official response The town's mayor, Liberal Democrat David Hughes, said: ""Is this an election stunt or is the government concerned for the people of Matlock? ""It's very difficult to determine."" In Derby, flood defences were built on Exeter Bridge as the River Derwent continued to rise. The A52, the main route into the city from the M1 was one of several roads partly closed due to flooding and many bus services were suspended. It reached its highest-ever recorded level and is expected to peak at 22:00. Some premises in the city have been evacuated and Derby Theatre has cancelled performances for the night.

One simple answer is governments of all parties have been accused of not spending enough on protection. You can build walls along river banks and many places have been guarded this way but such 'hard defences' are expensive and obtrusive. An alternative is to employ what are known as soft defences. These include encouraging farmers to manage their land in ways that let fields hold back floodwater. Driveways and car parks can be surfaced with materials that allow it to reach the soil underneath. Another option is to make homes more resilient - fitting exterior doors with waterproof plastic panels, sealing the ground floor and raising fuse boxes. In some ways the country has become better prepared for flooding but lessons are not always learned and the misery for many keeps being repeated. A Morrisons van was trapped in the Rufford Ford in Nottinghamshire Serious disruption continues to affect the transport network, with Northern warning ofsevere delays and cancellations across its network,external. The rail operator issued ""do not travel"" advice for passengers using several lines hit by floods. Those affected run between: Sheffield and Gainsborough Sheffield and Lincoln Sheffield and Goole Sheffield to Leeds via Moorthorpe. The line between Hebden Bridge and Manchester reopened in the early afternoon. East Midlands Railway said flooding had affected the line close to Derby with trains on the London/Sheffield route being diverted. Allow Twitter content?

Sturgeon: 'Scotland's future at stake in election',"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: 'Future of the country is at stake' Nicola Sturgeon has set out a list of demands she would make in return for backing a minority Labour government to keep Boris Johnson out of Number 10. Ms Sturgeon made clear that Labour would need to back the ""principle"" of a second independence referendum. The first minister said she would also seek greater powers for the Scottish Parliament, and an end to austerity. But the SNP leader insisted she would not form a formal coalition with Labour if there is a hung parliament. Instead, she said her party would potentially be willing to back a minority Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn on an issue-by-issue basis. The Conservatives said Ms Sturgeon's comments meant the UK could be facing referendums on both the EU and independence next year if Labour wins the election. And Labour said it was aiming to win the election and was therefore ""not in the business of talking about deals with other parties"". The latest from the general election trail Reality check: Nicola Sturgeon's SNP campaign speech SNP campaign launch: Scotland's remain party? Election 2019: Key questions facing Scotland's parties The SNP won 35 seats in the last general election in 2017, making it the third largest party in the House of Commons and leading to speculation that it could hold the balance of power if no one wins an outright majority in the election on 12 December. But Ms Sturgeon again warned that other parties ""need not bother picking up the phone"" to her after the election unless they are willing to support her party's right to hold an independence referendum next year. She said her party would drive a ""hard bargain"" with anyone seeking SNP support in the event of a hung parliament - and explicitly ruled out doing any deal with the Conservatives. Ms Sturgeon's list of demands for SNP support included the ""principle of the people of Scotland deciding our own future"", as well as the devolution of powers over immigration, employment and drug laws. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said during a visit to Scotland on Thursday that he would fight to ""keep our fantastic United Kingdom together and prevent another referendum next year"". The prime minister has ruled out supporting Ms Sturgeon's plan for another independence referendum The Liberal Democrats are also firmly opposed to another independence referendum - while Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said indyref2 is neither ""desirable or necessary"" and has indicated he would not support one in the ""formative years"" of a Labour government. Speaking tothe BBC's Laura Kuenssbergafter the launch of her party's election campaign, Ms Sturgeon said that the SNP holding the balance of power after the election would put Scotland in an ""incredibly influential position"". She stressed that she would ""never put Boris Johnson in power"" and claimed that people had ""good reason"" to be concerned about the prospect of Mr Corbyn becoming prime minister. But she insisted it would be better to have SNP MPs ""in there making sure the right issues are progressed and the right values upheld"". The SNP leader had earlier said the vote on 12 December would be the ""most important in our lifetime"", and said the outcome would determine the future of the country for ""generations to come"". Ms Sturgeon said Scotland had been on a ""journey"" in the two decades since the creation of the devolved Scottish Parliament. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon is asked whether she'd be willing to form an alliance with Jeremy Corbyn But she claimed that ""many of the gains of the last 20 years and the promise of a better future"" were now under threat from what she described as ""hardline Brexit ultras"" within the Conservative Party. Ms Sturgeon said: ""Scotland's vote to remain in the EU has been ignored. ""The Conservative Party has ridden roughshod over the Scottish Parliament. For the first time ever the UK government has chosen to legislate on devolved matters without the consent of Holyrood. ""With so-called 'moderate' Conservatives in full retreat and the hard-line Brexit ultras on the march, that is surely only a taste of what is to come."" Ms Sturgeon addressed a pro-independence rally in Glasgow at the weekend Ms Sturgeon said a vote for the SNP was therefore a vote to ""escape Brexit"" and to ""take Scotland's future out of the hands of Boris Johnson and a broken Westminster system"". And she said the SNP already had ""a cast iron mandate"" for another independence referendum and warned the prime minister that he has ""no right to block the democratic wishes of the people of Scotland"". Ms Sturgeon also unveiled plans for the SNP to launch a bill at Westminster aimed at protecting the NHS across the UK from privatisation and future trade deals. The NHS Protection Bill would block any UK government from using the NHS as a ""bargaining chip"" in trade talks. Election 2019: Could the NHS be 'up for sale'? Could US companies run NHS services after Brexit? If passed it would also give devolved parliaments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland a veto on any deal, she said. Ms Sturgeon claims that despite health policy being devolved to the Scottish Parliament, the UK government could still ""sell off"" the NHS in trade negotiations. The UK government has insisted the NHS is ""not on the table"" for trade talks and is not in any way ""up for sale"", pledging to bring forward the ""biggest programme of NHS investment in a generation"" if the Conservatives win the election. Nicola Sturgeon does not rule out a deal with Mr Corbyn, or Labour, in the event of a hung Parliament. She has a shopping list which seems to grow by the day - from anti-austerity economics through the enhanced devolution of benefits through action on climate change. But top of that list is a further referendum on independence. Might Mr Corbyn be persuaded to adopt that? He won't say yes or no. It isn't a priority, we are told. No deal, no pact. Labour would govern as a minority and challenge others to cast their votes on individual issues. But then successive members of Team Corbyn cloud the issue once more by hinting it might arise a bit down the road. Would Ms Sturgeon be willing to wait? Perhaps - although she insisted at the launch that the timetable should be determined by the Scottish Parliament, not at Westminster. This potential accommodation, of course, does not operate in a vacuum. Particularly in Scotland, each of the other parties is advancing a case with regard to these twin issues of Brexit and independence. Read more on Brian Taylor's blog - SNP launch: Scotland's remain party? Michael Gove of the Conservatives said Ms Sturgeon had dropped a ""bombshell"" onto the election campaign by again saying she would seek a fresh independence referendum as a price for supporting Mr Corbyn in government. Mr Gove said: ""That would mean there would be two referendums next year - one on Europe, and one on Scotland's independence. It's the last thing this country needs. ""We need to get Brexit done and get on with the people's priorities, but the SNP and Labour instead want more misery as two referendums consume all the air in our political system."" The Shadow Brexit Secretary, Keir Starmer, said Labour would not be doing deals with anyone when asked about the party's position on a second independence referendum in Scotland. Speaking on the campaign trail in Wales, Mr Starmer said: ""The Labour party is in this election for real change and we're in it to win it, and therefore we're not in the business of talking about deals with other parties."" Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said her party would be willing to work with other parties at Westminster, but cautioned: ""When it comes to the SNP, they need to drop their obsession with independence because we've just had three years of Brexit chaos that's hurting our country, that's hurting our public services."" ""We need to learn the lessons of Brexit not repeat the mistakes."" Do you have any other questions about elections in the UK?

General election campaign latest,"The SNP launched its campaign by promising to protect the NHS from privatisation and future trade deals Labour announced plans to extend statutory maternity pay to a full year and increase flexible working rights The Conservatives proposed a fast-track ""NHS visa"" for foreign doctors and nurses to work in UK Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson and Brexit Party leader Nigel Farage were also on the campaign trail The Liberal Democrats, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party formed an electoral pact on Thursday UK goes to the polls on 12 December Dulcie Lee, Paul Gribben and Lucy Webster Today made for some whimsical photo ops as well as more serious policy announcements It's been another long day on the campaign trail, with party leaders travelling all over the UK. Here are the key points from Friday: The shadow foreign secretary, Emily Thornberry, has said Labour will make ""no deals with the Scottish Nationalists."" Speaking in Crawley, she said: ""We
keep telling Nicola Sturgeon, and she does need to listen. There are no deals.
No deals."" She said this would remain the case even if the party had to form a minority government. ""If we get into power and we're a
minority government, and the Scots Nats bring us down, they will have to go
back to their voters in Scotland and explain how they've let the Tories back
in. No deals. No deals,"" she said. Ms Thornberry added: ""What we're focusing on is that within six months of a general election we get Brexit sorted."" Jo Swinson insists the Liberal Democrats would never allow another Scottish independence referendum. Ms Swinson is on a campaign visit to North East Fife, the most marginal constituency at the last election, wherethe SNP beat the Lib Dems by just two votes. The Lib Dem leader says another independence referendum is ""the last thing we need"" and warns it would only create further ""chaos"". ""Our UK family of nations is incredibly
precious,"" she says. She says her party is the only one explicitly opposing both Brexit and Scottish independence, and adds theTories' post-Brexit plans to attract more doctors and nurseswere ""insulting"" medical workers. This Matters is a new BBC series looking at issues that affect you and how you vote. It goes beyond politicians - and Brexit - to explain what's happening and what it means. This week: the environment. This video can not be played We explain the parties' environmental policies - from fracking to net zero emission targets. Long hours, media scrutiny, angry voters and canvassing in the rain. Going on the campaign trail is a gruelling experience even for the lucky ones who win. But what about those who never win but keep coming back for more? Alice Evans meets the election losers. Brian TaylorBBC Scotland Political Editor Down the decades, the SNP has deployed sundry formulae to stress their promotion of Scottish interests. One thinks, in particular, of the campaign arguing that the black gold in the North Sea was ""Scotland's oil"". Today,at the party's election launch in Edinburgh, Nicola Sturgeon essayed a new version. The SNP, she said, was ""Scotland's Remain party"". Now, self-evidently, this is primarily a method of addressing Brexit - the core, defining issue of this entire contest. A way, further, of positing the SNP firmly on the side of retaining membership of the European Union. But there is a second, equally expected, element. Which is to place Brexit in the context of the SNP's primary aim. Scottish independence. Read Brian's full analysis here. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Liberal Democrat politician Heidi Allen with Green Party MEP Molly Scott Cato, Plaid Cymru's Liz Saville Roberts and President of the UK Liberal Democrats Sal Brinton A group of Remain-supporting Labour MPs have criticised the pact agreed between the anti-Brexit parties Liberal Democrats, the Green Party and Plaid Cymru.

Like Mr Austin, Mr Flavell, an 84-year-old former till maker and a lifelong Labour supporter, is backing Boris Johnson. Read the full story here. Alistair McGhie, BBC Wales Former Welsh Secretary Alun Cairn, speaking for the first time since resigning on Wednesday, has refused to answer questions on when he knew about the collapse of a rape trial caused by his former aide. He
said he will let the Cabinet Office look into what happened, adding that he would not be drawn into a ""trial by media"". Speaking
in the Vale of Glamorgan, the seat which he is defending, he said he's keen to
get on with the campaign. Read more on why Mr Cairns resignedandwhat he said in the interview. What's been happening today? For those of you not slavishly following every twist and turn of the election campaign, here is a round-up of what's been going on today:  Norman SmithAssistant political editor SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon knows her best route to stopping
Brexit is through a hung Parliament â if this election is again inconclusive. This would hugely increase the leverage
of her party. And today she gave her clearest indication yet that she
would be prepared to help Jeremy Corbyn into Downing Street as part of that
attempt to stop Brexit â but at a price. And that price would be the removal of nuclear weapons
from Scotland, and above all the granting of another independence referendum
next year. Thatâs probably not a message that Boris Johnson will
be too worried about. Because his core campaign message at this election has
been: Vote Labour and youâll get two more referendums â one on Brexit and one
Scottish independence. You can read more about the SNP's campaign launch here.

Earlier this week Michael Gove told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: âWe will have an inquiry into Islamophobia and it will be established before the end of the year absolutely.â Earlierthe BBC announced its plansfor a series of election debates - including a face-off between the Conservative Party's Boris Johnson and Labour's Jeremy Corbyn. It will also host a seven-way podium debate and several Question Time specials -but the Liberal Democrats saidthe decision to exclude them from the head-to-head was ""another establishment stitch-up to shut down debate"". So why did the BBC do it? In a blog post, Jonathan Munro, the head of BBC Newsgathering - the part of the corporation which provides live coverage and news reports - explains the decision. ""The regulatory framework (which is the same as that for other broadcasters) means that we can scrutinise and give coverage to parties in a way that relates to their different levels of electoral support - in other words, parties may have different amounts of airtime and won't all necessarily be included in all programmes in the same way,"" he writes. ""So potential prime ministers can get more scrutiny - and airtime - than other party leaders. But that judgement is based on real votes cast, not speculation about the upcoming result. ""It means the Conservative and Labour parties - who between them secured more than 80% of the vote in 2017 - will have more prominence at times than all the smaller parties. ""That explains why head-to-head debates are now part of the mix; in 2010, the Liberal Democrats entered the election with more than 60 MPs, having won 22% of the vote - three times higher than they managed at the 2017 general election - and far ahead of the next largest parties, including the SNP, who back then, had just six MPs."" Read the post in full here. Shadow women and equalities minister Dawn Butler says a Labour government would ""dismantle the structural barriers"" facing women in the workplace. This morning,the party set out a number of policies in this area, including increasing the length of statutory maternity pay and promising the right to choose flexible working when starting a job. Speaking on a visit to Stevenage Ms Butler says many men have ""a privilege code
to the lift"", fast-tracking them into managerial positions. She adds that Labour would ""lay the grounds for an elevator"" for women,
to help them secure a level playing field in the world of work. Earlier on, SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon launched her party's election campaign. Talking about the prospect of the UK leaving the EU's single market and customs union, she said: ""Economic analysis says that it will cost every person in Scotland Â£1,600"". We put that to our Reality Check team.They said the figure came from aScottish government assessment,externalin January 2018 - before either Theresa May's or Boris Johnson's deals. It estimated that leaving the single market and customs union would knock Â£9bn off Scottish output (in 2016 pounds), which it divided by the population of Scotland to get about Â£1,600 per person. So it's saying that GDP per person would be Â£1,600 lower than it would otherwise have been in 11 years, but that's not the same as costing each individual Â£1,600.

In an interview outside the centre, Mr Ashworth said the prime minister, whoâs been elsewhere in Nottinghamshire today, âshould be here,
apologising to the patients on trolleys, apologising to the staff who work so
hard. He should be apologising for cutting over 15,000 beds in our

Teen murdered girlfriend after she dumped him,"The court heard Ellie Gould was a keen horse rider who talked of joining the mounted police A teenager stabbed his ex-girlfriend repeatedly in the neck in a ""frenzied attack"" before trying to make it appear her wounds were self-inflicted. Thomas Griffiths admitted murdering Ellie Gould, 17, at her home in Calne, Wiltshire, in May, after she ended their relationship. Griffiths, now aged 18, went to the schoolgirl's home, killed her and then left her hand on the knife handle. He was jailed for a minimum of 12 and a half years at Bristol Crown Court. Carole Gould said there was nothing in Griffiths' behaviour before her daughter's death that ""would ring alarm bells"". ""We welcomed him into our home. We ate dinner with him,"" she said. Ellie Gould's killer 'should never be released' The packed courtroom heard the night before Griffiths murdered her, Ellie had told friends they had broken up and he had ""not taken it well"". The pair were A-level students at Hardenhuish School in Chippenham, had known each other since Year 7, and been in a relationship for three months. Thomas Griffiths was 17 when he killed Ellie in her family home Griffiths walked out of school on the morning of 3 May and drove to Ellie's home in Springfield Drive. There he attempted to strangle her, before stabbing her 13 times in the neck with a knife taken from the kitchen. ""Griffiths became angry, perhaps by Ellie's continued rejection of him, and he attacked her,"" prosecutor Richard Smith QC said. A statement was read out in court from Ellie's father, Matt Gould, who found her lying on the kitchen floor with the knife still in her neck. He said it was ""the most frightening, horrific and saddest scene I have ever experienced"" and it ""fills my thoughts all day"". This video can not be played Carole Gould: 'I'll never forget that phone call' Evidence suggested Griffiths had put Ellie's hand on the weapon to make it look like she had done it to herself. The court heard Griffiths spent an hour at the house before he drove home, changed his clothes and dumped a bag of items taken from Ellie's house in a wood. Later that day he sent a series of ""fake"" messages to friends and to Ellie's mobile phone asking if she wanted to meet. Griffiths also told friend marks on his neck were caused by self-harm but the court heard they most likely caused by his ""young victim fighting for her life"". Ellie Gould told friends Griffiths had ""not taken their break-up well"" Sentencing him, Judge Mr Justice Garnham told Griffiths his actions had been a ""frenzied knife attack"" and ""the most appalling act"" on a ""vulnerable young woman in her own home where she should have been safe"". He said Ellie had ""tried desperately to fight back, scratching frantically at your neck"" and ""most chilling is that you left her on the kitchen floor with the knife still in her neck and with her left hand on the knife"". The judge told Griffiths it was one of several steps he had taken to ""cover your tracks"". ""There can be no more dreadful scene for any parent to contemplate than that which confronted Ellie's father when he came home that day from work,"" Mr Justice Garnham said. The court had previously heard Ellie was a keen horse rider who competed in local shows and cross-country events, and talked of joining the mounted police. The judge told Griffiths: ""The effects of your actions have not only snuffed out the life of this talented girl... but loaded pain on her friends and family."" The court was told thatfollowing his guilty plea in August, Griffiths, of Derry Hill, Wiltshire, had written a letter outlining his ""heartfelt remorse"". In it, he said: ""IÂ feel confused and angry at myself that I was able to hurt someone so special to me."" Ellie's body was found at a house in Springfield Drive, Calne Det Ch Insp Jim Taylor of Wiltshire Police said Griffiths ended Ellie's life ""in the cruellest way imaginable"" and ""destroyed the lives of those who were close to her"". ""While I know that this prison sentence will not bring Ellie back, and 12 and a half years no doubt seems insignificant given the severity of this crime and the colossal loss for this family, I hope that in some way it provides them with some form of closure,"" he added.

SNP launches campaign with 'NHS Protection Bill',"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: 'Future of the country is at stake' Nicola Sturgeon has set out a list of demands she would make in return for backing a minority Labour government to keep Boris Johnson out of Number 10. Ms Sturgeon made clear that Labour would need to back the ""principle"" of a second independence referendum. The first minister said she would also seek greater powers for the Scottish Parliament, and an end to austerity. But the SNP leader insisted she would not form a formal coalition with Labour if there is a hung parliament. Instead, she said her party would potentially be willing to back a minority Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn on an issue-by-issue basis. The Conservatives said Ms Sturgeon's comments meant the UK could be facing referendums on both the EU and independence next year if Labour wins the election. And Labour said it was aiming to win the election and was therefore ""not in the business of talking about deals with other parties"". The latest from the general election trail Reality check: Nicola Sturgeon's SNP campaign speech SNP campaign launch: Scotland's remain party? Election 2019: Key questions facing Scotland's parties The SNP won 35 seats in the last general election in 2017, making it the third largest party in the House of Commons and leading to speculation that it could hold the balance of power if no one wins an outright majority in the election on 12 December. But Ms Sturgeon again warned that other parties ""need not bother picking up the phone"" to her after the election unless they are willing to support her party's right to hold an independence referendum next year. She said her party would drive a ""hard bargain"" with anyone seeking SNP support in the event of a hung parliament - and explicitly ruled out doing any deal with the Conservatives. Ms Sturgeon's list of demands for SNP support included the ""principle of the people of Scotland deciding our own future"", as well as the devolution of powers over immigration, employment and drug laws. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said during a visit to Scotland on Thursday that he would fight to ""keep our fantastic United Kingdom together and prevent another referendum next year"". The prime minister has ruled out supporting Ms Sturgeon's plan for another independence referendum The Liberal Democrats are also firmly opposed to another independence referendum - while Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said indyref2 is neither ""desirable or necessary"" and has indicated he would not support one in the ""formative years"" of a Labour government. Speaking tothe BBC's Laura Kuenssbergafter the launch of her party's election campaign, Ms Sturgeon said that the SNP holding the balance of power after the election would put Scotland in an ""incredibly influential position"". She stressed that she would ""never put Boris Johnson in power"" and claimed that people had ""good reason"" to be concerned about the prospect of Mr Corbyn becoming prime minister. But she insisted it would be better to have SNP MPs ""in there making sure the right issues are progressed and the right values upheld"". The SNP leader had earlier said the vote on 12 December would be the ""most important in our lifetime"", and said the outcome would determine the future of the country for ""generations to come"". Ms Sturgeon said Scotland had been on a ""journey"" in the two decades since the creation of the devolved Scottish Parliament. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon is asked whether she'd be willing to form an alliance with Jeremy Corbyn But she claimed that ""many of the gains of the last 20 years and the promise of a better future"" were now under threat from what she described as ""hardline Brexit ultras"" within the Conservative Party. Ms Sturgeon said: ""Scotland's vote to remain in the EU has been ignored. ""The Conservative Party has ridden roughshod over the Scottish Parliament. For the first time ever the UK government has chosen to legislate on devolved matters without the consent of Holyrood. ""With so-called 'moderate' Conservatives in full retreat and the hard-line Brexit ultras on the march, that is surely only a taste of what is to come."" Ms Sturgeon addressed a pro-independence rally in Glasgow at the weekend Ms Sturgeon said a vote for the SNP was therefore a vote to ""escape Brexit"" and to ""take Scotland's future out of the hands of Boris Johnson and a broken Westminster system"". And she said the SNP already had ""a cast iron mandate"" for another independence referendum and warned the prime minister that he has ""no right to block the democratic wishes of the people of Scotland"". Ms Sturgeon also unveiled plans for the SNP to launch a bill at Westminster aimed at protecting the NHS across the UK from privatisation and future trade deals. The NHS Protection Bill would block any UK government from using the NHS as a ""bargaining chip"" in trade talks. Election 2019: Could the NHS be 'up for sale'? Could US companies run NHS services after Brexit? If passed it would also give devolved parliaments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland a veto on any deal, she said. Ms Sturgeon claims that despite health policy being devolved to the Scottish Parliament, the UK government could still ""sell off"" the NHS in trade negotiations. The UK government has insisted the NHS is ""not on the table"" for trade talks and is not in any way ""up for sale"", pledging to bring forward the ""biggest programme of NHS investment in a generation"" if the Conservatives win the election. Nicola Sturgeon does not rule out a deal with Mr Corbyn, or Labour, in the event of a hung Parliament. She has a shopping list which seems to grow by the day - from anti-austerity economics through the enhanced devolution of benefits through action on climate change. But top of that list is a further referendum on independence. Might Mr Corbyn be persuaded to adopt that? He won't say yes or no. It isn't a priority, we are told. No deal, no pact. Labour would govern as a minority and challenge others to cast their votes on individual issues. But then successive members of Team Corbyn cloud the issue once more by hinting it might arise a bit down the road. Would Ms Sturgeon be willing to wait? Perhaps - although she insisted at the launch that the timetable should be determined by the Scottish Parliament, not at Westminster. This potential accommodation, of course, does not operate in a vacuum. Particularly in Scotland, each of the other parties is advancing a case with regard to these twin issues of Brexit and independence. Read more on Brian Taylor's blog - SNP launch: Scotland's remain party? Michael Gove of the Conservatives said Ms Sturgeon had dropped a ""bombshell"" onto the election campaign by again saying she would seek a fresh independence referendum as a price for supporting Mr Corbyn in government. Mr Gove said: ""That would mean there would be two referendums next year - one on Europe, and one on Scotland's independence. It's the last thing this country needs. ""We need to get Brexit done and get on with the people's priorities, but the SNP and Labour instead want more misery as two referendums consume all the air in our political system."" The Shadow Brexit Secretary, Keir Starmer, said Labour would not be doing deals with anyone when asked about the party's position on a second independence referendum in Scotland. Speaking on the campaign trail in Wales, Mr Starmer said: ""The Labour party is in this election for real change and we're in it to win it, and therefore we're not in the business of talking about deals with other parties."" Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said her party would be willing to work with other parties at Westminster, but cautioned: ""When it comes to the SNP, they need to drop their obsession with independence because we've just had three years of Brexit chaos that's hurting our country, that's hurting our public services."" ""We need to learn the lessons of Brexit not repeat the mistakes."" Do you have any other questions about elections in the UK?

UK asylum claims 'taking substantially longer',"Decisions on asylum applications are taking ""substantially"" longer than they were five years ago, data suggests. In 2014, 80% of applicants received an initial decision within six months, compared with around 25% now, according to the Migration Observatory. There is also an uneven distribution of claimants, with 150 councils failing to support any, while Glasgow has 4,000. The Home Office says it is committed to ensuring claims are considered without unnecessary delay. In 2019, it dropped its six-month target in order to prioritise cases involving vulnerable people and for those where initial decisions are reconsidered. The Migration Observatory, which is based at the University of Oxford, found that in the last quarter of 2018 an initial decision was made within six months in 25% of cases. In the second quarter of 2014, that figure was 80%. As of 30 June this year, just under 32,000 people seeking asylum were awaiting an initial decision on their case, with just under 17,000 of these applicants waiting for more than six months. Asylum claim delays 'unacceptably high' UK 'cannot end freedom of movement' on Brexit day How could a UK points-based immigration system work? Dr Peter Walsh, a researcher at the Migration Observatory at the University of Oxford and author of the briefing, said: ""There is no single explanation for the falling share of decisions taken in six months. ""Factors that could have played a role include changes to policy and management, the complexity of the cases the Home Office receives, and of course budget constraints."" Earlier this year it emerged the government had dropped a target to deal with most asylum cases within six months. Now it's becoming clear why: The target was consistently being missed and had become virtually meaningless. Some might argue that it's better for a decision to take longer if it's the right one, given the Home Office's poor record on getting initial decisions right - between 2012 and 2016, 40% of asylum refusals that went to appeal were overturned. And there may be merit in the department's argument that it's better to prioritise cases involving the most vulnerable refugees rather than strive to get claims determined in an arbitrary time limit. However, the concern is that as delays get worse, the uncertainty and stress levels increase among some of the UK's most marginalised and traumatised groups of people. If someone wishes to stay in the UK as a refugee, they must be unable to go back to their country because of a fear of persecution,the government says.,external They should apply for asylum when they arrive in the UK or as soon as they realise it would be unsafe to return to their home country. After they have made an application, they will go to a ""screening"" - a meeting with an immigration officer - where they will be asked why they want asylum. Following that, they will undergo an interview during which they are asked to explain and show evidence of how they were persecuted in their home country and why they are afraid to go back. In 2018, 37,453 people applied for asylum in the UK. Asylum seekers whose claims are pending cannot work or access benefits, and are instead eligible to receive financial support of Â£5.39 per day. If their claims are approved they can work and access benefits. If their claim is declined, they can appeal against the decision, with cases sometimes lasting years. The analysis also found 55% of cases were eventually successful - 38% were granted at the initial decision, and a further 17% were granted after appeal. Most people seeking asylum in 2018 were from Iran, Iraq, Eritrea, Pakistan and Albania, with most living in the north east of the UK. Glasgow had the most asylum seekers proportionately as of the end of June this year, with the south east and east of England housing the fewest, the report found. Dr Walsh said the data suggests that in the year to June 2019, more than 150 parts of the UK did not house a single asylum seeker while Glasgow took in more than 4,000. This video can not be played Hazar Almahmoud undertook a dangerous Aegean Sea crossing to reach Europe from war-torn Syria with her daughter before making an asylum claim in the UK And 20 local authorities, mainly in Scotland and the north of England, host as many claimants as the remaining 362 council areas combined, he said. ""Many of these authorities will have supported resettled refugees, but nevertheless, the distribution of asylum seekers around the UK is pretty unequal"", he added. '2,200-mile journey to save my daughter' No asylum seeker evictions in Glasgow 'without court order' Dr Liberty Vittert, a UN Refugee Agency board member and data scientist, said the wait between making an asylum application and an initial decision is akin to ""purgatory"". ""That is the word I use when talking about asylum seekers awaiting a decision,"" she said. ""The financial support of Â£5.35 per day, you can barely buy breakfast for Â£5.35, and people say 'well, they can cook', but cook where? You are at the mercy of a country where you don't speak the language and don't know the culture."" The Children's Society said long waiting times for claims to be decided could be ""hugely detrimental"" for young asylum seekers. Sam Royston, director of policy and research at the charity, added: ""Young people feel powerless and unable to influence the outcomes of a decision that will affect the rest of their lives. ""They are left in a state of limbo, unable to plan for their futures.""

Royal Mail tries to stop Christmas postal strike,"Royal Mail is seeking a High Court injunction to stop a postal strike, claiming that the ballot of workers had ""potential irregularities"". The company said,externalit would make a formal application on Friday that the strike ballot ""was unlawful and, therefore, null and void"". A strike threatens to disrupt postal voting in the run-up to the general election as well as Christmas post. The Communications Workers Union says it ""refutes"" Royal Mail's claim. The ballot of 100,000 Royal Mail staff was held over job security and terms. No dates for a strike have yet been set. Members of the Communications Workers Union (CWU) last monthvoted by 97% in favour of a nationwide strike, saying the company had failed to adhere to an employment deal agreed last year. Royal Mail rejects this, which is why there are no grounds for industrial action, it says. In the company's statement on Friday, Royal Mail said it had evidence of CWU members coming under pressure to vote ""yes"" in the ballot. This included, the company claimed, union members ""being encouraged to open their ballot papers on site, mark them as 'yes', with their colleagues present and filming or photographing them doing so, before posting their ballots together at their workplace postboxes"". Royal Mail's procedures state employees cannot open their mail at delivery offices without the prior authorisation of their manager. CWU general secretary Dave Ward said: ""It will be clear to all our members and everybody connected with Royal Mail and this dispute, that the chief executive and his board will go to any lengths to deny the democratic mandate of our members to stand together and fight for their future and the very future of UK postal services."" He said the CWU had made it clear to Royal Mail that it was willing to talk, including through this weekend. A High Court hearing into Royal Mail's application for the injunction is expected to be heard early next week. Royal Mail has previously told the union that if it removed the threat of industrial action for the rest of 2019, the company would enter talks without preconditions. But the CWU called Royal Mail's offer a ""stunt"" which the union would not fall for. Industrial relations at the company have worsened this year, with frequent unofficial strikes breaking out. The CWU has said the result of the ballot, held between 24 September and 15 October, represents the largest ""yes"" vote for national industrial action since the passing of the Trade Union Act 2016. The union claims that up to 50,000 jobs are at risk at Royal Mail and Parcelforce, under plans to separate Parcelforce from the postal business.

Teen murdered girlfriend after she dumped himThomas Griffiths stabbed 17-year-old Ellie Gould repeatedly in the neck at her house.Wiltshire,"The court heard Ellie Gould was a keen horse rider who talked of joining the mounted police A teenager stabbed his ex-girlfriend repeatedly in the neck in a ""frenzied attack"" before trying to make it appear her wounds were self-inflicted. Thomas Griffiths admitted murdering Ellie Gould, 17, at her home in Calne, Wiltshire, in May, after she ended their relationship. Griffiths, now aged 18, went to the schoolgirl's home, killed her and then left her hand on the knife handle. He was jailed for a minimum of 12 and a half years at Bristol Crown Court. Carole Gould said there was nothing in Griffiths' behaviour before her daughter's death that ""would ring alarm bells"". ""We welcomed him into our home. We ate dinner with him,"" she said. Ellie Gould's killer 'should never be released' The packed courtroom heard the night before Griffiths murdered her, Ellie had told friends they had broken up and he had ""not taken it well"". The pair were A-level students at Hardenhuish School in Chippenham, had known each other since Year 7, and been in a relationship for three months. Thomas Griffiths was 17 when he killed Ellie in her family home Griffiths walked out of school on the morning of 3 May and drove to Ellie's home in Springfield Drive. There he attempted to strangle her, before stabbing her 13 times in the neck with a knife taken from the kitchen. ""Griffiths became angry, perhaps by Ellie's continued rejection of him, and he attacked her,"" prosecutor Richard Smith QC said. A statement was read out in court from Ellie's father, Matt Gould, who found her lying on the kitchen floor with the knife still in her neck. He said it was ""the most frightening, horrific and saddest scene I have ever experienced"" and it ""fills my thoughts all day"". This video can not be played Carole Gould: 'I'll never forget that phone call' Evidence suggested Griffiths had put Ellie's hand on the weapon to make it look like she had done it to herself. The court heard Griffiths spent an hour at the house before he drove home, changed his clothes and dumped a bag of items taken from Ellie's house in a wood. Later that day he sent a series of ""fake"" messages to friends and to Ellie's mobile phone asking if she wanted to meet. Griffiths also told friend marks on his neck were caused by self-harm but the court heard they most likely caused by his ""young victim fighting for her life"". Ellie Gould told friends Griffiths had ""not taken their break-up well"" Sentencing him, Judge Mr Justice Garnham told Griffiths his actions had been a ""frenzied knife attack"" and ""the most appalling act"" on a ""vulnerable young woman in her own home where she should have been safe"". He said Ellie had ""tried desperately to fight back, scratching frantically at your neck"" and ""most chilling is that you left her on the kitchen floor with the knife still in her neck and with her left hand on the knife"". The judge told Griffiths it was one of several steps he had taken to ""cover your tracks"". ""There can be no more dreadful scene for any parent to contemplate than that which confronted Ellie's father when he came home that day from work,"" Mr Justice Garnham said. The court had previously heard Ellie was a keen horse rider who competed in local shows and cross-country events, and talked of joining the mounted police. The judge told Griffiths: ""The effects of your actions have not only snuffed out the life of this talented girl... but loaded pain on her friends and family."" The court was told thatfollowing his guilty plea in August, Griffiths, of Derry Hill, Wiltshire, had written a letter outlining his ""heartfelt remorse"". In it, he said: ""IÂ feel confused and angry at myself that I was able to hurt someone so special to me."" Ellie's body was found at a house in Springfield Drive, Calne Det Ch Insp Jim Taylor of Wiltshire Police said Griffiths ended Ellie's life ""in the cruellest way imaginable"" and ""destroyed the lives of those who were close to her"". ""While I know that this prison sentence will not bring Ellie back, and 12 and a half years no doubt seems insignificant given the severity of this crime and the colossal loss for this family, I hope that in some way it provides them with some form of closure,"" he added.

Billionaire Bloomberg considers run for presidentNew York's ex-mayor is concerned current Democratic hopefuls cannot beat Donald Trump in 2020.US & Canada,"Michael Bloomberg has highlighted climate change and gun control as key issues Billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg is again considering entering the race for the US Democratic party's presidential nomination. The ex-New York City mayor is concerned the current field of candidates is not good enough to beat Donald Trump in the 2020 election, an adviser says. The 77-year-old is expected to file paperwork on Friday for the Democratic presidential primary in Alabama. However, he has so far not announced his decision to run. If Mr Bloomberg does get on the ballot in Alabama, he will still have to register in other states which have later filing deadlines. State-by-state votes, known as primaries and caucuses, will be held from February next year to pick a Democratic White House nominee. The eventual winner will be crowned at the party convention in Wisconsin in July. He or she is expected to face President Trump, a Republican, in the general election in November. A total of 17 Democratic candidates are vying to be the party's standard-bearer. Former Vice-President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders are the front-runners. Who's leading race to take on Trump? Meet the Democrats vying to challenge Trump The key issues for 2020 Democrats At a campaign fundraiser in Boston on Thursday, Mr Biden did not address Mr Bloomberg's potential candidacy. Ms Warren welcomed Mr Bloomberg to the race on Twitter, linking to her own campaign website and suggesting the former mayor take a look for potential policy plans. In a more pointed response, seemingly directed at Mr Bloomberg, Mr Sanders wrote on Twitter: ""The billionaire class is scared and they should be scared."" Some recent opinion polls have suggested that Ms Warren and Mr Sanders - who are more politically liberal than Mr Biden - might face an uphill battle against Mr Trump. Long-time Trump critic joins Republican race to unseat Trump In a statement, Howard Wolfson said: ""We now need to finish the job and ensure that Trump is defeated. ""But Mike is increasingly concerned that the current field of candidates is not well positioned to do that.

But his advisers also acknowledge that Mr Bloomberg's belated entry to the race could present challenges in states like Iowa and New Hampshire, where other Democratic contenders have been campaigning for months. The Bloomberg team are reportedly planning to focus on the so-called Super Tuesday contests in March, when 14 states, including California, Alabama and Colorado, will vote on a single day for their preferred White House nominee. If he enters the race, Mr Bloomberg will face intense scrutiny of his three-term mayoral record in New York. While in office, he defended the New York Police Department's use of the controversial stop-and-frisk policy, similar to stop-and-search in the UK, which critics say disproportionately targets African Americans and Hispanics. Black voters are a vital constituency for Democrats. Speaking to reporters on Friday, President Trump said Mr Bloomberg ""will fail"" if he joins the Democratic race.

Mr Bloomberg has, I understand, been doing a lot of polling in early voting states like Iowa and New Hampshire.

'I pawned my nan's jewellery for a dating scammer'Victims of a man who conned 19 women say they worry he will continue when released from prison.UK,"Dating apps should do more to verify users to help prevent romance fraud, the Victims' Commissioner has said. The BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme spoke to victims of a man who was jailed for conning 19 women out of Â£24,000. ""He started to say he was at my house. 'You better call me quick, I'm here, nice house, nice steps. When that money is paid we'll be out of each other's lives. If not, things will get nasty.'"" Chloe - not her real name - met Ivan Nkazi through a dating app where he posed using the fake name Lancel. He conned her using a well-practised tactic before they even met - saying he was stuck at a petrol station and had an issue with payment for his fuel. He then claimed the petrol station staff were racist and police were attending. In just one day, Chloe gave him almost Â£600 - but he wanted more. ""I said, 'No, I have no more. I can't, I'm a single mother of two children on my own,'"" she says. ""He became malicious, hurtful, quite personal."" Nkazi, 31, from Liverpool, ran his scams like a business for almost four years via dating sites like Tinder and Plenty of Fish. He used a detailed index system to keep track of the stories he told women to ensure he never made a mistake. Ivan Nkazi posed as two different men to scam Chloe Several days later he scammed Chloe for a second time, posing as a man called Mallah who texted her from an unknown number. She was suspicious but told him about her previous experience of losing the money. Nkazi then messaged using his original fake name, saying he had been attacked because she had shared this information with this second man. ""Within minutes, I had a barrage of text messages asking for more money, and that's when the really nasty threats started,"" she says. ""I was shaking like a leaf. I was frightened of being in trouble with the police which is what stopped me telling them in the first place."" Feeling she had no other choice, she pawned jewellery inherited from her grandmother for Â£600 and borrowed a further Â£400, taking the total amount he scammed from her to Â£1,600. The Victoria Derbyshire programme has spoken to five of his 19 victims - many of them were vulnerable, others simply thought they were doing a good deed, but the impact of the scam has been long-lasting. ""He played on the vulnerability elements because he knew I was looking for a loving, meaningful relationship,"" Chloe says, reflecting on his approach. ""He suggested to me that he was [looking for that] as well and it made me want to help him more."" Nkazi's victims are not alone. Latest figures from City of London Police show from August 2018 to July 2019 there were 5,756 reports of romance fraud compared with 3,209 in 2014-15 - a 79% increase. Dame Vera Baird says there needs to be more targeted support for romance fraud The Victims' Commissioner Dame Vera Baird now says dating apps should take more responsibility for verifying users. ""There should be a register of people who have been convicted of romance fraud, similar to Clare's Law,"" she said, referring to the system that allows those in fear of domestic violence to ask police for information. ""And there needs to be a more targeted line of victim support to cater to victims of romance fraud."" Criminals who commit romance fraud trawl through profiles and piece together information such as wealth and lifestyle, in order to manipulate their victims Police can investigate and help to provide support, but often cannot get the money back It is very simple for fraudsters to cover their tracks by masking IP addresses and using unregistered phone numbers Never send money to someone online you have never met Think twice about posting personal information which could be used to manipulate or bribe you Source: Action Fraud,external In August, Nkazi was sentenced to three years in jail after pleading guilty to 11 counts of fraud and four counts of malicious communications. Det Sgt Chris Hawitt led the investigation and thinks it is ""entirely possible"" there are more victims. ""It's a particularly horrible crime because it's indiscriminate. He targeted women of all professions, all levels of education, all backgrounds,"" he said. ""Unfortunately these women didn't mean anything to him other than a source of income. And in one case he unfortunately threatened to throw acid in their face if they didn't comply with his demands."" Nkazi has also been given a five-year serious crime prevention order which means he cannot use dating apps without telling the police his usernames. But Chloe says that does not give her any comfort, saying he will just pose as new people. She remains scared of him. ""If he could describe my house, could he revisit it? He frightened me that much I'm concerned about the future when he's released."" Follow the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme onFacebook,externalandTwitter,external- and see more of our storieshere.

Billionaire Bloomberg considers run for president,"Michael Bloomberg has highlighted climate change and gun control as key issues Billionaire businessman Michael Bloomberg is again considering entering the race for the US Democratic party's presidential nomination. The ex-New York City mayor is concerned the current field of candidates is not good enough to beat Donald Trump in the 2020 election, an adviser says. The 77-year-old is expected to file paperwork on Friday for the Democratic presidential primary in Alabama. However, he has so far not announced his decision to run. If Mr Bloomberg does get on the ballot in Alabama, he will still have to register in other states which have later filing deadlines. State-by-state votes, known as primaries and caucuses, will be held from February next year to pick a Democratic White House nominee. The eventual winner will be crowned at the party convention in Wisconsin in July. He or she is expected to face President Trump, a Republican, in the general election in November. A total of 17 Democratic candidates are vying to be the party's standard-bearer. Former Vice-President Joe Biden, Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren and Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders are the front-runners. Who's leading race to take on Trump? Meet the Democrats vying to challenge Trump The key issues for 2020 Democrats At a campaign fundraiser in Boston on Thursday, Mr Biden did not address Mr Bloomberg's potential candidacy. Ms Warren welcomed Mr Bloomberg to the race on Twitter, linking to her own campaign website and suggesting the former mayor take a look for potential policy plans. In a more pointed response, seemingly directed at Mr Bloomberg, Mr Sanders wrote on Twitter: ""The billionaire class is scared and they should be scared."" Some recent opinion polls have suggested that Ms Warren and Mr Sanders - who are more politically liberal than Mr Biden - might face an uphill battle against Mr Trump. Long-time Trump critic joins Republican race to unseat Trump In a statement, Howard Wolfson said: ""We now need to finish the job and ensure that Trump is defeated. ""But Mike is increasingly concerned that the current field of candidates is not well positioned to do that. ""Based on his record of accomplishment, leadership and his ability to bring people together to drive change, Mike would be able to take the fight to Trump and win,"" Mr Wolfson said. But his advisers also acknowledge that Mr Bloomberg's belated entry to the race could present challenges in states like Iowa and New Hampshire, where other Democratic contenders have been campaigning for months.

Teen in school drag act ban puts on talent show,"The Not Just a Boy in a Dress programme followed Lewis's ""very personal journey"", the BBC said A 15-year-old boy who was banned from performing his drag act at a school event has put on his own talent show. Last year, Castle High School and Visual Arts College in Dudley told Lewis Bailey his act was not permitted, saying it celebrated diversity but felt the performance was not ""appropriate"". Lewis's own show at a working men's club ""went really well"", his mother Natalie, 38, said. A documentary on him is on the BBC iPlayer and will be broadcast on CBBC. Lewis was banned from performing his drag act at the school's end-of-year talent show in 2018 and said he was upset by the decision. ""In the long run it worked out in his favour as he's had the chance to do other things,"" his mum said. ""Lewis has done shows on his own before but this was the first show he's put together himself."" Lewis, who has performed as Athena Heart, said he was ""very lazy"" but felt she was ""completely opposite... more outgoing"" Speaking in the programme, Lewis said: ""Drag is amazing for me. All the negativity just disappears. I'm on that stage in front of people. It makes me feel like I'm wanted in the world. ""I am actually already trying to plan another performance... That's very important for me to help out and give what I can."" Meet the heavy metal drag queen 'Itâs about accepting and loving yourself' Latest news from the West Midlands The event in September this year, called Proud To Be Different, attracted a crowd of about 50 or 60 people, said his mother. ""For every negative comment, there have been 30 to 100 positive comments,"" Natalie said. ""So I said that's what he needs to concentrate on. He's just amazing."" Lewis has raised money for The Albert Kennedy Trust, which said it helps keep ""LGBTQ+ young people safe and supported"" The Not Just a Boy in a Dress TV programme followed Lewis's ""very personal journey"", the BBC said. After ""years of bullying and a prolonged and difficult estrangement from his biological dad - Lewis has finally found the strength"" to be confident in his own skin, it said. ""Gran makes his costume, sister Mariah does the choreography, sister Gemma helps with the publicity, stepdad Dale helps with the music and Mum is there for constant support,"" BBC publicity for the episode featuring Lewis said. He was banned from performing his drag act at the school's end-of-year talent show in 2018 Last year the school, now St James Academy, said: ""Our decision not to let Lewis perform was based on his age and the nature of his act. ""We are happy for Lewis to express his identity in whichever way he chooses, when it is appropriate for him to do so, as he did on Friday at our non-uniform day.""

"Care sector 'leaks' Â£1.5bn every yearHundreds of millions of pounds paid in care home fees are not being used for frontline costs, a study suggests.BusinessComments","Hundreds of millions of pounds of care home fees paid by residents and local authorities are never reaching frontline services, claims a report. The Centre for Health and Public Interest has revealed Â£1.5bn a year ""leaks out"" through rental payments, interest on loans, and profits. The figure is 10% of the total annual income of the UK care home industry. The think tank says some of this money could be used for frontline care if the industry were restructured. The centre's study - which is part funded by Unison - analysed the accounts of 830 adult care home companies across the UK. The average cost for a residential care home place in the UK is Â£32,084 per year, not including nursing care. The study found that among the 26 largest care home providers, Â£261m of the money they receive to provide care goes towards repaying debt. Of this, Â£117m goes to related companies. ""Hundreds of millions of pounds a year leak out of the care home industry in the form of rental payments to offshore landlords, in the form of profit, in the form of management fees and in the form of rental payments again to offshore companies,""  CHPI director David Rowlands told Newsnight. ""Lots of debt has been loaded onto large care home companies by the companies that brought them and that means in some cases that 16% of all the money that is given over to care for a resident each week disappears out of the system to pay off those high cost loans."" More than 90% of all care home services are now provided by the private sector. Where not to live if you want a good care home The crisis in care Care services 'at risk' as funding doubts grow Nick Hood, a senior analyst at Opus restructuring, said: ""The average interest rate paid by the major care home operators in 2017 was 11.8%, which means that they were paying over Â£235m a year in interest and that's money that could be going to frontline care, but isn't."" He said some estimates suggest this financing model pushes up the cost for a care home resident ""by anything between Â£100 and Â£200 a week"". According to the Health Foundation think tank, Â£4.4bn per year will be needed by 2023 just to stabilise the market. One of Britain's largest care home groups, Four Seasons Health Care,went into administrationearlier this year after struggling to repay debts. One of their homes - Ross Wyld in north-east London - closed the year before after they were unable to renegotiate the renewal of their lease. Alan Lazurus's mother, Hettie, was one of the residents forced to relocate. ""She was 93, she was obviously getting on but she wasn't actually senile or had dementia at that stage,"" he said. ""You put someone into a nursing home - you certainly expect there would be a longevity for her."" Four Seasons declined to comment on the closure of Ross Wyld.

Dozens sleep at shopping centre amid floods,"Some shops stayed open late while Carphone Warehouse reportedly let people charge their phones Dozens of people have spent the night in a shopping centre in Sheffield after torrential downpours flooded the city's streets. People bedded down on benches and chairs in the Meadowhall centre, while others tried throughout the night to get home in cars or taxis. Amajor incident was declared in Sheffieldas rain continued overnight. Elsewhere, in Rotherham firefighters rescued people by boat who were stranded in the Parkgate centre. People are being told to evacuate their homes in the villages of Old Kirk Sandall and Sandal Grove near Doncaster after the River Don burst its banks. There are three severe flood warnings - meaning a danger to life - in place along the River Don. More than 100 flood warnings remain in place,,externalmostly in the north of England, with the rain causing serious disruption to roads and rail services. Flooding in Yorkshire: Latest updates East Midlands flooding: Latest updates The Environment Agency said a number of high volume pumps were being used to move water away from homes in Catcliffe in Rotherham. Sheffield City Council said several major roads from Derbyshire to Sheffield remained closed. The fire service pulled people to safety from the Parkgate centre Earlier on Thursday,35 homes in Mansfield, Nottinghamshire, were evacuatedafter a mudslide caused by torrential rain. In Sheffield, hundreds of people - including those attending the Christmas Live event, which was cancelled - were kept inside Meadowhall centre by police after the surrounding streets were flooded. The centre later reopened but many people chose to stay overnight, after being unable to get home. The floodwater surrounding Meadowhall shopping centre, just off the M1 Disney Store worker Jodie Whelan, 23, stayed at the centre, where she said staff were handing out free drinks and trying to arrange taxis. She said she travelled in for her shift by bus but said getting back was ""an absolute no-go"". ""I'm feeling very tired,"" she added. ""A bit fed up but trying to make the best out of an awful situation. The atmosphere is very weird but communal.

Malan hits T20 ton in England win,"Eoin Morgan and Dawid Malan shared an England record 182-run stand in the fourth T20 against New Zealand Fourth Twenty20, McLean Park, Napier England 241-3:Malan 103* (51), Morgan 91 (41) New Zealand 165:Southee 39, Parkinson 4-47, Jordan 2-24 England won by 76 runs; series level at 2-2 Scorecard Dawid Malan hit the fastest T20 century by an England batsman as the tourists crushed New Zealand by 76 runs in Napier to level the five-match series with one game remaining. On an astonishing night, Malan struck 103 from 51 balls to become the second England player to make a T20 ton. Captain Eoin Morgan made 91 from just 41 balls as England posted their highest T20 total of 241-3. Leg-spinner Matt Parkinson took 4-47 as New Zealand were dismissed for 165. The final match takes place in Auckland on Sunday at 01:00 GMT. In a brutal display, Malan reached three figures from just 48 balls, hitting a ragged New Zealand attack for nine fours and six sixes. He and Morgan put on 182 runs - the highest stand for England in a T20 international -  in just 12.2 overs. Alex Hales is the only other England international to make a T20 century, having made anunbeaten 116 from 64 ballsagainst Sri Lanka in 2014. New Zealand could not match England's hitting as they were dismissed with 19 balls remaining, with all five of England's bowlers claiming at least one wicket. Morgan hails England's batting display as one of their best TMS podcast: England's record-breaking day, Finn's washing woes & Bond's ambition Sir Vivian Richards Q&A - download the latest Stumped podcast Dawid Malan hit 15 boundaries in his 51-ball innings England were 18-1 in the early stages of the match but that was a distant memory by the time Morgan was dismissed in the final over. Napier might be a small ground but Morgan and Malan produced a stunning display of hitting to power England to their match-winning total. No bowler was allowed to settle. Leg-spinner Ish Sodhi had his final over smashed for 28 by Malan while Blair Tickner, so economical in the third T20, was taken for 50 from his four overs. The two came together in the eighth over and Morgan showed his intent as he dispatched his sixth ball for six. Helped by New Zealand's poor discipline, the two plundered the bowling - Morgan hit straight while Malan went square. They never looked troubled, their hard hitting allowing the ball to evade the fielders. Malan's half-century came from 31 balls, while Morgan's, brought up just three balls after Malan, was from 21. From there, the pace only accelerated. Dot balls were a rarity in the final few overs as Malan moved smoothly towards his century. His sixth six of the evening, brought up off New Zealand's premier bowler Trent Boult, took him to a superb century. It looked as though Morgan would match him as he swiped the third ball of the final over for six, but he holed out in the deep to fall nine runs short. The England captain had said at the toss that he would have bowled first. As he left the field, he may have been relieved that the decision was taken out of his hands. Malan and Morgan hit 29 boundaries between them, including 13 sixes There were just nine dot balls in the final 10 overs Malan and Morgan's 182-run stand is the fourth highest in all T20 internationals Malan is the first player to register more than four 50+ scores in his first 10 T20Is Morgan now has the fastest half-century in T20 and ODI cricket for England Blair Tickner, who registered figures of 2-25 in the third T20, went wicketless in Napier New Zealand had the chance to clinch a series victory and, having dismissed Jonny Bairstow cheaply and trapped Tom Banton lbw just as his innings began to fire after opting to bowl, they were in a strong position. However, their discipline crumbled as Malan and Morgan attacked, with even the returning Boult unable to stop the boundaries from flowing. They made a frenetic start with the bat, racing to 49-0 inside the first four overs as Martin Guptill hit Chris Jordan out of the ground, but the innings stuttered along. Only five players reached double figures and stand-in captain Tim Southee was the top-scorer as he hit out from the number eight spot. England's fielding was not at its best, with Pat Brown dropping two chances off Parkinson, but ultimately it was enough to take the series into a deciding match. England batsman Dawid Malan, speaking to Sky Sports:""It's not often in your career everything comes off, it was a lot of fun out there. ""I felt rusty in the first game of the series but it's felt smoother and smoother. I said this morning that I felt I had got rid of the rust and thankfully it clicked here. ""Morgs came out and changed the momentum of the game and I piggy-backed that."" England bowler Steven Finn on Test Match Special:""It was a professional performance from England. They managed to turn the screw when needed. ""Dawid Malan takes pride in being able to pace his innings, judge who to attack and when to attack them and he did that really well today."" England captain Eoin Morgan:""It was quite a clinical performance. Myself and Dawid have played for a long time together at Middlesex and we know each other pretty well. ""It was enjoyable, we had a lot of laughs out there. It was a beautiful wicket to bat on."" New Zealand stand-in captain Tim Southee:""That can happen in Twenty20 cricket, in two days time we've got another chance to go out and win the series. ""You have to go out and believe when you're chasing a target like that, we got off to a good start but whenever we looked like getting away they took wickets.""

Girl's 200-mile trips for leukaemia treatment,"This video can not be played Â£600 a month to travel for cancer treatment Parents of a child who has to make 200-mile round trips for cancer treatment are calling for more help with the costs of travel. Elin Rowlands, 13, from Anglesey, was diagnosed with leukaemia in 2013 and had to travel to Liverpool's Alder Hey hospital to get specialist treatment. Elin's mother said it cost them between Â£35 and Â£40 for each return trip. The Welsh Government said some families are eligible to claim for travel costs if they meet certain criteria. There is a specialist cancer unit for young people in Cardiff but there is no service for those further north. Alison Rowlands gave up work to care for her daughter Elin and said she had to depend on friends for financial help when their car broke down. Mrs Rowlands toldNewyddion 9: ""At the start it was very scary... you don't think about the journey right, it's get your daughter there, get her better. ""It's then as the treatment goes on, that it's 'oh my goodness, I've got to go there a lot'. ""We were spending roughly Â£35 to Â£40 each trip to go there and come back and most of them were day trips, and there's a lot of them. ""We stayed there quite a lot in the beginning, but then we had to go back about four times a week. Elin, pictured with her mother, suffered a relapse last year ""You had to look at the diary constantly, what time are we going? When do we need to set off? Have we got petrol in the car? ""My husband drove most of the time, but because of his job he couldn't do it all the time. ""I wouldn't like to imagine how much I've spent on the fuel in that amount of time.

Boy's 'neck pain' was rare throat cancer 'Why me? I had ovarian cancer at 14' Teenage cancer patient aims to promote body image Mrs Rowlands said the local community pulled together and collected ""a really good amount of money"" they were able to spend on fuel. ""If the government did decide to help out with families, that would be amazing - until you go through something like this, you have no idea whatsoever."" Elin relapsed in January 2018 and needed a bone marrow transplant, but had to be transferred to a unit in Manchester. She still travels to Liverpool and Manchester for tests, but no longer needs treatment. Alder Hey children's hospital cares for over 330,000 young people every year Richard Pugh, from the Wales Cancer Alliance, is also backing the calls for more support: ""The cost ramifications are huge because those specialist services aren't that local. ""You've got to travel. Unless you're in Cardiff and those services are right on your doorstep."" The charity CLIC Sargent estimated Elin's family would spend on average Â£600 a month on travel costs. The charity want the Welsh Government to create a Â£250,000 annual travel fund, to help families pay for travel costs. Mr Pugh said: ""What we'd like to see is a travel fund for young people affected by cancer so they don't have that financial burden."" Richard Pugh said ""in an ideal world"" there would be multiple treatment units across the country The Teenage Cancer Trust unit at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff is the only specialist unit for young people with cancer in Wales. Ashley Bassett, 23, from Pencoed, Bridgend, was diagnosed with leukaemia when he was studying for his GCSEs and visited the unit. ""This unit is very important. It's a place I can come and relax. It's a nice environment. There's a pool table, TV and games,"" he said. ""There's opportunities to try and be as normal as you can in hospital, because hospitals aren't the place to be sometimes, but this unit makes it much more bearable. ""It's unfortunate that people live too far away to come here for treatment."" Cancer survival improvements slow down Breast cancer taboo 'can cause isolation' Fast cancer checks urged for north Wales Mr Pugh said ""in an ideal world"" there would be multiple units across Wales. ""Unfortunately, our workforce isn't in the condition it should be to do that,"" he said. Ashley Bassett said the support unit he used has a ""nice environment"" ""We're at a real cusp of some massive issues with our workforce, not just for children but across the board. ""So we need to make sure that we get the support for patients in the right location, at the right time. At this time, it does mean travelling.""

A spokesperson said: ""Families can be eligible to claim help for travel costs from the NHS if their child has to go to hospital for NHS treatment.

Brazil ruling could free jailed ex-President Lula,"This video can not be played Lula spoke to the BBC from prison earlier this year Brazil's top court has voted to overturn a rule about the jailing of criminals - a change which could lead to ex-President Luiz InÃ¡cio Lula da Silva being freed from custody. The ruling, announced on Thursday, stipulates that convicted criminals should go to prison only after they have exhausted their appeal options. The change could lead to the release of thousands of prisoners, including Lula. The left-winger led Brazil between 2003 and 2010, but was jailed last year. He was favourite to win last year's presidential election but was imprisoned after being implicated in a major corruption investigation. However, even if he is released, he will be barred from standing for office because of his criminal record. Lula: Saint or sinner? A quick guide to Brazil's scandals Lula has consistently denied all the accusations against him and claims they are politically motivated. After he was barred from running, far-right candidate Jair Bolsonaro went on to win the race. Lula's lawyers say they will seek the former president's ""immediate release"" after speaking to him on Friday. Justices voted to reinterpret the country's penal code in a six-five vote issued on Thursday. It overturns a three-year-old rule which mandated immediate prison time for convicted criminals after they lost their first appeal. Brazil's corruption scandal, known as Operation Car Wash, initially centred on the state-run oil company Petrobras, but subsequently billions of dollars of bribes were uncovered - and dozens of high-profile business leaders and politicians were jailed. Lula supporters rallied outside the court on Thursday The mandatory imprisonment rule was seen as helping prosecutors secure convictions and unravel the major corruption scandal by encouraging suspects to negotiate plea deals. But critics claimed it violated Brazil's constitution - which states that no one can be deprived of their liberty without due process of law. The country's Car Wash task force described Thursday's overturning as being ""inconsistent"" with efforts to fight corruption. The proposed change was also opposed by Sergio Moro, the judge who sentenced Lula, who is now serving as Mr Bolsonaro's justice minister. Chief Justice Jose Antonio Dias Toffoli, who cast the deciding vote, said releases would be made on a case-by-case basis. The change could affect almost 5,000 prisoners, according to National Council of Justice estimates. Lula was jailed in 2018 after being sentenced to more than 12 years in prison, later reduced to eight years and 10 months, for receiving a beachside apartment from an engineering company implicated in the Car Wash investigation. Earlier this year, he was sentenced to another 12 years after being found guilty of accepting bribes in the form of renovation work at a country house from construction companies. Lula, 74, argues all the charges made against him are politically motivated. He is former trade union activist and remains an iconic and popular figure for the left. Gleisi Hoffman, the leader of Lula's Worker's Party, called Thursday's development ""a very important step to strengthen democracy and the constitution at a time when they are under threat from an extreme-right government.""

Tories 'deeply sorry' for rape victim's distressThe party says it is sorry for the distress caused to the victim whose rape trial collapsed.Wales politics,"The Welsh Tories have said they are ""deeply sorry"" for the circumstances around a collapsed rape trial involving a former aide to Alun Cairns. Ross England caused the case's collapse when he gave evidence a judge had ruled inadmissible. Eight months later he was selected to stand for the Conservatives in the 2021 Welsh Assembly elections. A spokeswoman said the party was sorry for the distress caused to the victim at the centre of the trial. A row over what Mr Cairns knew about the collapse of the court caseled to his decision to quit as Welsh secretary on Wednesday. Mr Englandhad been accused by a crown court judge of sabotage. The defendant James Hackett, a friend of Mr England's, was subsequently convicted of rape at a retrial.

Following the interview a statement was sent to BBC Wales in which a party spokeswoman said: ""We are deeply sorry for the circumstances surrounding the collapse of the trial and the deep distress this must have caused the victim, her family and friends. ""Mr England has been suspended from the party and a full investigation is under way. ""We are proud to support the many women who work for or engage with our party and employ a strict ethical code for staff and volunteers as part of our human resource strategy."" In evidence to the April 2018 trial Mr England made claims of a casual sexual relationship with the victim, which she has denied. The judge Stephen John Hopkins had earlier told the trial that evidence of the sexual history of the victim was inadmissible.

Ross England has been suspended as a candidate for the Vale of Glamorgan at the assembly election Mr Cairns, the Conservative general election candidate for the Vale of Glamorgan, had claimed he did not know about Mr England's involvement in the collapse of the trial until last week.

Girl faces 200-mile trips for leukaemia treatment,"This video can not be played Â£600 a month to travel for cancer treatment Parents of a child who has to make 200-mile round trips for cancer treatment are calling for more help with the costs of travel. Elin Rowlands, 13, from Anglesey, was diagnosed with leukaemia in 2013 and had to travel to Liverpool's Alder Hey hospital to get specialist treatment. Elin's mother said it cost them between Â£35 and Â£40 for each return trip. The Welsh Government said some families are eligible to claim for travel costs if they meet certain criteria. There is a specialist cancer unit for young people in Cardiff but there is no service for those further north. Alison Rowlands gave up work to care for her daughter Elin and said she had to depend on friends for financial help when their car broke down. Mrs Rowlands toldNewyddion 9: ""At the start it was very scary... you don't think about the journey right, it's get your daughter there, get her better. ""It's then as the treatment goes on, that it's 'oh my goodness, I've got to go there a lot'. ""We were spending roughly Â£35 to Â£40 each trip to go there and come back and most of them were day trips, and there's a lot of them. ""We stayed there quite a lot in the beginning, but then we had to go back about four times a week. Elin, pictured with her mother, suffered a relapse last year ""You had to look at the diary constantly, what time are we going? When do we need to set off? Have we got petrol in the car? ""My husband drove most of the time, but because of his job he couldn't do it all the time. ""I wouldn't like to imagine how much I've spent on the fuel in that amount of time. ""You worry enough about your daughter going through this horrible treatment without having to worry where the money's going to come to put petrol in the car."" Boy's 'neck pain' was rare throat cancer 'Why me? I had ovarian cancer at 14' Teenage cancer patient aims to promote body image Mrs Rowlands said the local community pulled together and collected ""a really good amount of money"" they were able to spend on fuel. ""If the government did decide to help out with families, that would be amazing - until you go through something like this, you have no idea whatsoever."" Elin relapsed in January 2018 and needed a bone marrow transplant, but had to be transferred to a unit in Manchester. She still travels to Liverpool and Manchester for tests, but no longer needs treatment. Alder Hey children's hospital cares for over 330,000 young people every year Richard Pugh, from the Wales Cancer Alliance, is also backing the calls for more support: ""The cost ramifications are huge because those specialist services aren't that local. ""You've got to travel. Unless you're in Cardiff and those services are right on your doorstep."" The charity CLIC Sargent estimated Elin's family would spend on average Â£600 a month on travel costs. The charity want the Welsh Government to create a Â£250,000 annual travel fund, to help families pay for travel costs. Mr Pugh said: ""What we'd like to see is a travel fund for young people affected by cancer so they don't have that financial burden."" Richard Pugh said ""in an ideal world"" there would be multiple treatment units across the country The Teenage Cancer Trust unit at the University Hospital of Wales in Cardiff is the only specialist unit for young people with cancer in Wales. Ashley Bassett, 23, from Pencoed, Bridgend, was diagnosed with leukaemia when he was studying for his GCSEs and visited the unit. ""This unit is very important. It's a place I can come and relax. It's a nice environment. There's a pool table, TV and games,"" he said. ""There's opportunities to try and be as normal as you can in hospital, because hospitals aren't the place to be sometimes, but this unit makes it much more bearable. ""It's unfortunate that people live too far away to come here for treatment."" Cancer survival improvements slow down Breast cancer taboo 'can cause isolation' Fast cancer checks urged for north Wales Mr Pugh said ""in an ideal world"" there would be multiple units across Wales. ""Unfortunately, our workforce isn't in the condition it should be to do that,"" he said. Ashley Bassett said the support unit he used has a ""nice environment"" ""We're at a real cusp of some massive issues with our workforce, not just for children but across the board. ""So we need to make sure that we get the support for patients in the right location, at the right time. At this time, it does mean travelling."" The Welsh Government said some families can be eligible to claim for travel costs if they meet certain criteria, such as claiming benefits. A spokesperson said: ""Families can be eligible to claim help for travel costs from the NHS if their child has to go to hospital for NHS treatment. ""We are committed to the provision of excellent care for children and young people but recognise that this may require families to travel outside of their health board area. ""While we appreciate the impact this has on families, it is also important to ensure that children and young people can receive expert care for what are often complex conditions from a sustainable service.""

Grace Millane suspect 'cleaned up blood' in room,"Blood found in the apartment is ""500,000 million times"" more likely to belong to Ms Millane than anyone else The suspect in the death of British backpacker Grace Millane attempted to clean up blood on the floor of the room where she died, a court in New Zealand heard on Friday. Tests also revealed the blood was ""500,000 million times more likely"" to belong to Ms Millane than anyone else. Prosecutors say Ms Millane, who was 22 and from Essex, was strangled after going on a date with the suspect. He claims the death was an accident during consensual sex. On Thursday, the court heard the suspect's phone was used to search for ""flesh-eating birds"" and the question ""are there vultures in New Zealand?"" Other search terms included ""the hottest fire"" and ""Waitakere Ranges"" - the location that Ms Millane's body was eventually found in a suitcase. The 27-year-old is not being named for legal reasons. Luminol was used to highlight the alleged blood stains on the floor of the apartment On Friday, the court heard there was evidence that attempts were made to clean up blood, which the defendant had already told police about. Scientist Dianne Crenfeldt told the jury she had located two approximately circular probably blood stains between the accused's bed and a wardrobe. ""The shape of the probable blood staining and the presence of blood on the floor provided strong support that clean up of blood had occurred in this area,"" she said. Another forensic scientist, Turlough Thomas-Stone, told the court that blood stains found on the suspect's fridge was ""500,000 million times"" more likely to belong to Ms Millane. Luminol testing also showed that ""somebody with blood on their feet moved around"" the room. A toxicologist said there was no sign of drugs in Ms Millane's body, but that her blood had 106 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood - more than double the legal limit for drivers in New Zealand. But toxicologist Diana Kappatos said microbial action after death may have increased or decreased the concentration of alcohol in her body. In New Zealand's court system, the accused and victims can ask to have their name suppressed, which means it becomes illegal to publish it in newspapers, online or anywhere else. The purpose is to protect people not yet proven guilty - but also to have a fairer trial by ensuring the jury is not prejudiced by media coverage. Images can also be withheld. When the main suspect in the Christchurch mosque attacks, Brenton Tarrant, appeared in court, the judge ordered the media to blur pictures of his face. Ms Millane was last seen in Auckland on 1 December last year. She had been on a trip around the world, travelling alone in New Zealand for two weeks. She met the suspect on the dating app Tinder, and the pair were seen kissing and going to several bars in the city centre. The defendant said the pair had engaged in rough sexual intercourse involving biting and hitting. He told the police he then first fell asleep in the shower and later went to bed but discovered Ms Millane's body only the next morning. ""I woke up the next day and saw that she was lying on the floor,"" the defendant was quoted as saying. ""I saw that she had blood coming from her nose.""

Cambodian politician turned away at Paris check-in,"This video can not be played Sam Rainsy in Paris in November: 'They had instructions from very high up not to allow me to board' Cambodia's self-exiled opposition leader - who vowed to return home this weekend - has said he was barred from checking-in for a flight from Paris. Sam Rainsy had planned to return to lead the people's ""fight for a better life,"" describing Prime Minister Hun Sen as ""a brutal dictator"". The country's authoritarian leader has ruled Cambodia since 1985. Mr Rainsy's party has been dissolved as part of a crackdown on the opposition and he has been in Paris in exile. ""I am extremely shocked because the people need me in Cambodia,"" Mr Rainsy said at Charles de Gaulle airport after he was turned away at the Thai Airways counter. He intended to fly to Bangkok and then reach Cambodia, but he claimed the check-in desk ""said they have received from very high up the instruction not to allow me to board"". He vowed to get another flight and stick to his plan to make it to Cambodia by Saturday, the country's independence day. Hun Sen said Mr Rainsy would be arrested should he try to enter the country. He also asked neighbouring countries to bar him from transiting, and advised airlines to not accept him as a passenger. On Thursday, Malaysia briefly detained Mr Rainsy's deputy Mu Sochua, vice-president of his outlawed party, who hoped to join him in Cambodia. Cambodia's efforts to stop the opposition politicians returning was condemned by Amnesty International and Human Rights Watch. The US embassy in Phnom Penh said the move represented ""an escalation in suppression of the political opposition"". Hun Sen (centre) is one of the world's longest-serving prime ministers Mr Rainsy is one of Cambodia's leading opposition figures but he has been living in Paris since 2015. He faces several lawsuits at home which his supporters say are all politically motivated. His Cambodian National Rescue Party (CNRP) was for some time seen as the biggest threat to Prime Minister Hun Sen's rule. It was dissolved in 2017 by the Supreme Court, based on a complaint from the government that it was conspiring with the US to overthrow it. Hun Sen: Cambodia's strongman prime minister When the UN ran a country Jailed for standing up to a strongman Over the past years, many of the party leadership have fled abroad to escape alleged political persecution. In 2017, fellow CNRP leader Kem Sokha was jailed in Phnom Penh on charges branded as political; after one year he was released on bail but has been under house arrest since. After Mr Rainsy announced his intent to return, Cambodia arrested dozens of opposition figures within the country. It's hard to see a way for him to make it into Cambodia. The government in Phnom Penh said it would arrest him and has asked all regional neighbours to bar him from entering. Hun Sen also sent troops to the border with Thailand to stop Mr Rainsy or his deputy from taking a land route. Observers also doubt whether Mr Rainsy really wants to return. ""Sam Rainsy is still very popular in Cambodia,"" Virak Ou, political analyst in Phnom Penh told the BBC, explaining that Cambodian politics is polarised between Hun Sen and Mr Rainsy. ""But this might just be a stunt to get attention. Sam Rainsy would never seriously want to come here just to be arrested."" Mr Ou said the actual goal might be to provoke the Cambodian government ""to react in a way that will prevent any compromise between Cambodia and the European Union"". The EU is currently deciding whether to introduce trade sanctions in reaction to Cambodia's increasingly authoritarian leadership. ""This would be in line with Mr Rainsy's strategy which has been consistent over the past years: to try to merit some form of international intervention,"" Mr Ou said. The country has been ruled by current Prime Minister Hun Sen for more than three decades. He was initially credited with economic growth and peace after the devastation caused by the Khmer Rouge regime, which was responsible for some of the worst mass killings of the 20th Century. Cambodia's garment industry would suffer from EU tariffs But he is increasingly seen as an authoritarian figure who does not tolerate real political challenge. When his Cambodian People's Party (CPP) looked like it might lose the 2018 general election, the government accused the opposition of attempting a coup and had it banned, making the Cambodia effectively a one-party state under the CPP. Hun Sen shows no signs of wanting to relinquish power. Elections are held every five years - and Hun Sen has vowed he will stay in power for at least another two terms.

SNP launching campaign with 'NHS Protection Bill',"This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon: 'Future of the country is at stake' Nicola Sturgeon has set out a list of demands she would make in return for backing a minority Labour government to keep Boris Johnson out of Number 10. Ms Sturgeon made clear that Labour would need to back the ""principle"" of a second independence referendum. The first minister said she would also seek greater powers for the Scottish Parliament, and an end to austerity. But the SNP leader insisted she would not form a formal coalition with Labour if there is a hung parliament. Instead, she said her party would potentially be willing to back a minority Labour government led by Jeremy Corbyn on an issue-by-issue basis. The Conservatives said Ms Sturgeon's comments meant the UK could be facing referendums on both the EU and independence next year if Labour wins the election. And Labour said it was aiming to win the election and was therefore ""not in the business of talking about deals with other parties"". The latest from the general election trail Reality check: Nicola Sturgeon's SNP campaign speech SNP campaign launch: Scotland's remain party? Election 2019: Key questions facing Scotland's parties The SNP won 35 seats in the last general election in 2017, making it the third largest party in the House of Commons and leading to speculation that it could hold the balance of power if no one wins an outright majority in the election on 12 December. But Ms Sturgeon again warned that other parties ""need not bother picking up the phone"" to her after the election unless they are willing to support her party's right to hold an independence referendum next year. She said her party would drive a ""hard bargain"" with anyone seeking SNP support in the event of a hung parliament - and explicitly ruled out doing any deal with the Conservatives. Ms Sturgeon's list of demands for SNP support included the ""principle of the people of Scotland deciding our own future"", as well as the devolution of powers over immigration, employment and drug laws. Prime Minister Boris Johnson said during a visit to Scotland on Thursday that he would fight to ""keep our fantastic United Kingdom together and prevent another referendum next year"". The prime minister has ruled out supporting Ms Sturgeon's plan for another independence referendum The Liberal Democrats are also firmly opposed to another independence referendum - while Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn has said indyref2 is neither ""desirable or necessary"" and has indicated he would not support one in the ""formative years"" of a Labour government. Speaking tothe BBC's Laura Kuenssbergafter the launch of her party's election campaign, Ms Sturgeon said that the SNP holding the balance of power after the election would put Scotland in an ""incredibly influential position"". She stressed that she would ""never put Boris Johnson in power"" and claimed that people had ""good reason"" to be concerned about the prospect of Mr Corbyn becoming prime minister. But she insisted it would be better to have SNP MPs ""in there making sure the right issues are progressed and the right values upheld"". The SNP leader had earlier said the vote on 12 December would be the ""most important in our lifetime"", and said the outcome would determine the future of the country for ""generations to come"". Ms Sturgeon said Scotland had been on a ""journey"" in the two decades since the creation of the devolved Scottish Parliament. This video can not be played Nicola Sturgeon is asked whether she'd be willing to form an alliance with Jeremy Corbyn But she claimed that ""many of the gains of the last 20 years and the promise of a better future"" were now under threat from what she described as ""hardline Brexit ultras"" within the Conservative Party. Ms Sturgeon said: ""Scotland's vote to remain in the EU has been ignored. ""The Conservative Party has ridden roughshod over the Scottish Parliament. For the first time ever the UK government has chosen to legislate on devolved matters without the consent of Holyrood. ""With so-called 'moderate' Conservatives in full retreat and the hard-line Brexit ultras on the march, that is surely only a taste of what is to come."" Ms Sturgeon addressed a pro-independence rally in Glasgow at the weekend Ms Sturgeon said a vote for the SNP was therefore a vote to ""escape Brexit"" and to ""take Scotland's future out of the hands of Boris Johnson and a broken Westminster system"". And she said the SNP already had ""a cast iron mandate"" for another independence referendum and warned the prime minister that he has ""no right to block the democratic wishes of the people of Scotland"". Ms Sturgeon also unveiled plans for the SNP to launch a bill at Westminster aimed at protecting the NHS across the UK from privatisation and future trade deals. The NHS Protection Bill would block any UK government from using the NHS as a ""bargaining chip"" in trade talks. Election 2019: Could the NHS be 'up for sale'? Could US companies run NHS services after Brexit? If passed it would also give devolved parliaments in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland a veto on any deal, she said. Ms Sturgeon claims that despite health policy being devolved to the Scottish Parliament, the UK government could still ""sell off"" the NHS in trade negotiations. The UK government has insisted the NHS is ""not on the table"" for trade talks and is not in any way ""up for sale"", pledging to bring forward the ""biggest programme of NHS investment in a generation"" if the Conservatives win the election. Nicola Sturgeon does not rule out a deal with Mr Corbyn, or Labour, in the event of a hung Parliament. She has a shopping list which seems to grow by the day - from anti-austerity economics through the enhanced devolution of benefits through action on climate change. But top of that list is a further referendum on independence. Might Mr Corbyn be persuaded to adopt that? He won't say yes or no. It isn't a priority, we are told. No deal, no pact. Labour would govern as a minority and challenge others to cast their votes on individual issues. But then successive members of Team Corbyn cloud the issue once more by hinting it might arise a bit down the road. Would Ms Sturgeon be willing to wait? Perhaps - although she insisted at the launch that the timetable should be determined by the Scottish Parliament, not at Westminster. This potential accommodation, of course, does not operate in a vacuum. Particularly in Scotland, each of the other parties is advancing a case with regard to these twin issues of Brexit and independence. Read more on Brian Taylor's blog - SNP launch: Scotland's remain party? Michael Gove of the Conservatives said Ms Sturgeon had dropped a ""bombshell"" onto the election campaign by again saying she would seek a fresh independence referendum as a price for supporting Mr Corbyn in government. Mr Gove said: ""That would mean there would be two referendums next year - one on Europe, and one on Scotland's independence. It's the last thing this country needs. ""We need to get Brexit done and get on with the people's priorities, but the SNP and Labour instead want more misery as two referendums consume all the air in our political system."" The Shadow Brexit Secretary, Keir Starmer, said Labour would not be doing deals with anyone when asked about the party's position on a second independence referendum in Scotland. Speaking on the campaign trail in Wales, Mr Starmer said: ""The Labour party is in this election for real change and we're in it to win it, and therefore we're not in the business of talking about deals with other parties."" Lib Dem leader Jo Swinson said her party would be willing to work with other parties at Westminster, but cautioned: ""When it comes to the SNP, they need to drop their obsession with independence because we've just had three years of Brexit chaos that's hurting our country, that's hurting our public services."" ""We need to learn the lessons of Brexit not repeat the mistakes."" Do you have any other questions about elections in the UK?

"Care sector 'leaks' Â£1.5bn every yearHundreds of millions of pounds paid in care home fees are not being used for frontline costs, a study suggests.Business","Hundreds of millions of pounds of care home fees paid by residents and local authorities are never reaching frontline services, claims a report. The Centre for Health and Public Interest has revealed Â£1.5bn a year ""leaks out"" through rental payments, interest on loans, and profits. The figure is 10% of the total annual income of the UK care home industry. The think tank says some of this money could be used for frontline care if the industry were restructured. The centre's study - which is part funded by Unison - analysed the accounts of 830 adult care home companies across the UK. The average cost for a residential care home place in the UK is Â£32,084 per year, not including nursing care. The study found that among the 26 largest care home providers, Â£261m of the money they receive to provide care goes towards repaying debt. Of this, Â£117m goes to related companies. ""Hundreds of millions of pounds a year leak out of the care home industry in the form of rental payments to offshore landlords, in the form of profit, in the form of management fees and in the form of rental payments again to offshore companies,""  CHPI director David Rowlands told Newsnight. ""Lots of debt has been loaded onto large care home companies by the companies that brought them and that means in some cases that 16% of all the money that is given over to care for a resident each week disappears out of the system to pay off those high cost loans."" More than 90% of all care home services are now provided by the private sector. Where not to live if you want a good care home The crisis in care Care services 'at risk' as funding doubts grow Nick Hood, a senior analyst at Opus restructuring, said: ""The average interest rate paid by the major care home operators in 2017 was 11.8%, which means that they were paying over Â£235m a year in interest and that's money that could be going to frontline care, but isn't."" He said some estimates suggest this financing model pushes up the cost for a care home resident ""by anything between Â£100 and Â£200 a week"". According to the Health Foundation think tank, Â£4.4bn per year will be needed by 2023 just to stabilise the market. One of Britain's largest care home groups, Four Seasons Health Care,went into administrationearlier this year after struggling to repay debts. One of their homes - Ross Wyld in north-east London - closed the year before after they were unable to renegotiate the renewal of their lease. Alan Lazurus's mother, Hettie, was one of the residents forced to relocate. ""She was 93, she was obviously getting on but she wasn't actually senile or had dementia at that stage,"" he said. ""You put someone into a nursing home - you certainly expect there would be a longevity for her."" Four Seasons declined to comment on the closure of Ross Wyld. The CHPI is calling for A Care Home Transparency Act, so that those paying for care in a care home know exactly where their money goes. You can watchNewsnighton BBC Two at 22:30 on weekdays.

"Grace Millane suspect 'cleaned up blood' in roomThe blood was ""500,000 million times more likely"" to be Ms Millane's than anyone else's.Asia","Blood found in the apartment is ""500,000 million times"" more likely to belong to Ms Millane than anyone else The suspect in the death of British backpacker Grace Millane attempted to clean up blood on the floor of the room where she died, a court in New Zealand heard on Friday. Tests also revealed the blood was ""500,000 million times more likely"" to belong to Ms Millane than anyone else. Prosecutors say Ms Millane, who was 22 and from Essex, was strangled after going on a date with the suspect. He claims the death was an accident during consensual sex. On Thursday, the court heard the suspect's phone was used to search for ""flesh-eating birds"" and the question ""are there vultures in New Zealand?"" Other search terms included ""the hottest fire"" and ""Waitakere Ranges"" - the location that Ms Millane's body was eventually found in a suitcase. The 27-year-old is not being named for legal reasons. Luminol was used to highlight the alleged blood stains on the floor of the apartment On Friday, the court heard there was evidence that attempts were made to clean up blood, which the defendant had already told police about. Scientist Dianne Crenfeldt told the jury she had located two approximately circular probably blood stains between the accused's bed and a wardrobe. ""The shape of the probable blood staining and the presence of blood on the floor provided strong support that clean up of blood had occurred in this area,"" she said. Another forensic scientist, Turlough Thomas-Stone, told the court that blood stains found on the suspect's fridge was ""500,000 million times"" more likely to belong to Ms Millane. Luminol testing also showed that ""somebody with blood on their feet moved around"" the room. A toxicologist said there was no sign of drugs in Ms Millane's body, but that her blood had 106 milligrams of alcohol per 100 millilitres of blood - more than double the legal limit for drivers in New Zealand. But toxicologist Diana Kappatos said microbial action after death may have increased or decreased the concentration of alcohol in her body. In New Zealand's court system, the accused and victims can ask to have their name suppressed, which means it becomes illegal to publish it in newspapers, online or anywhere else. The purpose is to protect people not yet proven guilty - but also to have a fairer trial by ensuring the jury is not prejudiced by media coverage. Images can also be withheld. When the main suspect in the Christchurch mosque attacks, Brenton Tarrant, appeared in court, the judge ordered the media to blur pictures of his face. Ms Millane was last seen in Auckland on 1 December last year. She had been on a trip around the world, travelling alone in New Zealand for two weeks. She met the suspect on the dating app Tinder, and the pair were seen kissing and going to several bars in the city centre. The defendant said the pair had engaged in rough sexual intercourse involving biting and hitting. He told the police he then first fell asleep in the shower and later went to bed but discovered Ms Millane's body only the next morning. ""I woke up the next day and saw that she was lying on the floor,"" the defendant was quoted as saying. ""I saw that she had blood coming from her nose.""

"Town's Hollywood-style sign to be taken downThere are now calls for the sign, which was installed to mark the National Eisteddfod, to stay.","Residents hope the sign can stay in the area A giant Hollywood-style sign installed to mark the National Eisteddfod in Llanrwst will be taken down next week. Overlooking the Conwy Valley, the sign has been popular with residents and there are now calls for it to be re-erected on a permanent basis.

""While it has been extremely popular, the structure's permit has sadly expired. ""However, we are aware of how fond local residents and visitors are of the sign and future discussions will take place on the possibility of it becoming a permanent feature in Gwydir Forest."" Mr Wynne said: ""I absolutely agree that it would be great to keep the sign in place, although I'm aware that this version was designed as a temporary structure so we'll be discussing with Natural Resource Wales and the National Park to see what's possible in the future. The sign was erected in July ""Locals have adopted the sign and asked for it to stay."" But he said if the sign was to stay, it would need to be rebuilt with ""more robust materials"".

"Nigel Farage targets south Wales Labour seatsHe will campaign in the region to persuade ""Labour heartland seats"" to back his Brexit Party.Wales politics","Nigel Farage: ""We are the challengers here in south Wales"" Nigel Farage has said the Brexit Party will try ""for a few more days"" to agree an electoral pact with the Tories. Campaigning in south Wales, he said his party would beat Labour in ""many constituencies"" in the region if the Conservatives withdrew from the field. But he also denounced Boris Johnson's deal with the EU as ""not Brexit"", calling it a ""short term political fix"" to win December's general election. He also challenged the prime minister to ahead-to-head debateon the deal. Nigel Farage will not stand as election candidate Minister quits in aide's rape trial 'sabotage' row Tory party has 'failed' working people - Drakeford Plaid Cymru's 'ambition for Wales without limit' The event took place on Friday in Little Mill near Pontypool, just over the border from the Labour-held constituency of Torfaen but located in the Tory-held constituency of Monmouth. Speaking at a village hall, Mr Farage had this message for Mr Johnson: ""If you really believe that this is a great new deal, or as you said in the last couple of days a fantastic deal, if you are really trying to tell the British public this gets Brexit done, let's have a civilised head-to-head debate on what this EU treaty means and I'd be only be too happy to stand with Boris to talk this through."" Last week, Boris Johnsonrejected suggestionsthat he should work with the Brexit Party during the election. Plaid Cymru, Liberal Democrats and the Greens have agreed apro-EU electoral pactin 11 of the 40 seats in Wales. Repeating his call for a leave alliance, Mr Farage said: ""if that leave alliance was put to the country it would win a very big majority"". Boris Johnson said last week he was ""always grateful for advice"" but would not enter into pacts Mr Farage denied trying to split the vote and accused the Conservative Party of not wanting to come to ""any sort of accommodation"". ""I'm going to go on trying for a few more days and make the point that in Torfaen, and other constituencies here in south Wales, the Conservatives haven't won for a hundred years,"" he said. ""And they're not going to win here on 12 December, there is no chance of them winning. ""So I would make this urgent plea to Boris Johnson and others - don't split the Brexit Party vote here in south Wales. ""We are the challengers here in south Wales and if you're not in the field we will beat Labour in many of these constituencies."" Mr Farage said the prime minister should ditch his Brexit deal because ""it's not Brexit, it's a short term political fix and an attempt to win a general election"". He urged Mr Johnson to ""make it clear that we absolutely have to leave"" the EU ""at some point in 2020, with or without any form of deal"". That deal ""must be a trade deal, not one based on regulatory and political alignment"", he added. Nigel Farage and MEP Nathan Gill meeting voters in Merthyr Tydfil ahead of May's European elections Mr Farage said his party was ready to fight all the Welsh seats, if there was no pact with the Conservatives. Asked earlier on BBC Radio Wales how many seats his party would win, Mr Farage said: ""I've no idea. Do you know, when I launched the campaign for the European elections, going back to April this year, I had no idea how we would do. ""We comfortably topped the poll in Wales, coming first in many, many seats."" Asked if he would publish an election manifesto, Mr Farage said he would produce what he called a ""contract with the British people"". He said it was 95% ready and the party would launch it in the next few weeks.

Jeff Sessions announces bid to return to US Senate,"Jeff Sessions appeared on Fox News shortly after confirming his run (file photo) Former US Attorney General Jeff Sessions has announced he is entering the Republican Party race to reclaim his former Senate seat in Alabama. President Donald Trump fired his top law official last year after a protracted feud over the inquiry into 2016 election meddling, which Mr Sessions declined to oversee. Mr Sessions, 72, held his Senate seat for two decades before serving as AG. Mr Trump is expected to campaign against him. In a statement announcing his run, Mr Sessions reiterated his support for the president despite their public ""ups and downs"". ""When I left President Trump's cabinet, did I write a tell-all book? No. Did I go on CNN and attack the president? No. Have I said a cross word about President Trump? No,"" a press release on his website said. ""And I'll tell you why: first, that would be dishonourable. I was there to serve his agenda, not mine. Second, the president is doing a great job for America and Alabama, and he has my strong support."" Jeff Sessions: Controversial conservative Mr Sessions also described himself in the statement as still being Mr Trump's ""strongest advocate"", in spite of being publicly ridiculed by the president. Mr Sessions was the first US senator to endorse Mr Trump for president The former senator is entering an already crowded race to seek the state's Republican nomination for the 2020 general election. Among those who have announced their intention to run is former Chief Justice Roy Moore, 72, who lost the special election for Mr Sessions' seat in December 2017. Mr Moore had been expected to win but his campaign was dogged by allegations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls. He eventually lost out to Doug Jones, who became the first Democrat to win a US Senate seat in the deeply conservative state for 25 years. An attack advert released hours after Mr Sessions launched his campaign told Alabama voters to ""say no to traitor Jeff"". The video, funded by supporters of Tommy Tuberville, US football coach also running for the Senate seat, showed a speech by Mr Trump saying: ""He's bad, he's a bad, bad guy"". Asked about Mr Sessions on Friday, Mr Trump told reporters: ""I heard he said very nice things about me last night. I have to see. I haven't made a determination."" ""You have some good people in Alabama,"" he said referring to other candidates. ""We'll see what happens."" Mr Trump said he would not campaign against Mr Sessions. Mr Sessions is a lifelong conservative who worked as a lawyer and served in the US Army reserves before entering the political stage. He became attorney general in Alabama - his home state - in 1994 and joined the Senate two years later. He was also the first US senator to endorse Mr Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign. This video can not be played Jeff Sessions was an early Trump supporter, but their relationship soured long before he was asked to resign During his time in Congress, Mr Sessions was an outspoken opponent of liberalising drug laws, gay marriage and immigration. Despite remaining deeply popular in Alabama, he resigned from his post in the Senate in 2017 to become Mr Trump's first attorney general. In March 2017, Mr Sessions recused himself from overseeing the Department of Justice's independent probe into Russian interference during the 2016 presidential election after it emerged he had met Russia's ambassador during the campaign. The decision was criticised by Mr Trump, who blamed it for the appointment of Robert Mueller as special counsel by Assistant Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Mr Sessions was the butt of many presidential barbs - in August 2018 Mr Trump tweeted that his attorney general was ""scared stiff and missing in action"". Mr Sessions was forced to resign less than three months later. A letter confirming the move made clear that the decision to go was not his own. Who is Jeff Sessions?
