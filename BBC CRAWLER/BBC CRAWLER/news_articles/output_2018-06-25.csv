Polish embassy 'funded far-right speakers',"The Slough book fair in 2017 featured prominent far-right Polish speakers like Marcin Rola (pictured second from the right) The Polish Embassy in London part-funded an event that gave a platform to right-wing extremists in the UK, a BBC Newsnight investigation has found. The embassy helped to finance a book fair in Slough in 2017, which included speakers from Poland well-known for promoting hate speech in their country. Experts have questioned whether such speakers should be allowed into the UK. The embassy says it funded the event after ""appropriate assessment"" by Poland's Ministry of Foreign Affairs. The embassy confirmed to Newsnight that funding it provided to the Slough Book Fair paid for speakers' accommodation in Britain. One of the speakers at the Slough event was Marcin Rola, who moderated the discussion and runs a far-right online TV station in Poland, Wrealu24, which has more than 140,000 subscribers on YouTube. In a recent broadcast, Rola told his viewers that Sweden is ""top of the league table in terms of rapes by Muslim immigrant-invaders on women. On everyone. On animals, on holes in the fence. Because, well, we all know how they behave"". In the UK, many of Mr Rola's statements would qualify as hate speech. He has told viewers that ""in Islam, paedophilia is their daily bread"" and refers to Muslims as ""savages"". When Newsnight questioned Mr Rola about his rhetoric, he said his comments were ""taken out of context"". Although he admitted that calling Muslims ""savages"" was ""quite harsh,"" he ""stood by"" his comments, as he said they were in the context of discussing grooming gangs. The Slough Book Fair was organised by a UK-based chapter of far-right group Polska Niepodlegla. It was also behind a fun run in February 2017, at which it had hoped to host Jacek Miedlar, a former priest well-known for his anti-Semitic and anti-Muslim rhetoric. Miedlar was unable to attend the fun run when he was prevented from entering Britain. He was again stopped from coming into the country in June, when he was hoping to attend a Britain First rally in Birmingham. Asked about the Slough Book Fair, the Polish Embassy told Newsnight that it had funded the event after ""an appropriate assessment and receiving acceptance according to the regulations specifying the use of MFA budget funds"". However, Michal Garapich, who has been studying Polish migration in the UK for more than a decade, says that although the membership of far-right groups in the UK is quite small, the ones that exist are feeling stronger. ""There are definitely more Polish Jehovah's Witnesses or Polish members of AA (Alcohol Anonymous) groups than there are far-right nationalists who organise themselves. But they have momentum now. ""They are emboldened, they are more assertive."" Mr Garapich links the new assertiveness of the Polish far right to the change of government in Poland. He says the ruling party, Law and Justice, gives ""nationalist, far right, sometimes fascist groups quite a lot of political oxygen, a lot of exposure, and even access to public funds"". Fiyaz Mughal, from the anti-extremism organisation Faith Matters, says events like the Slough Book Fair form part of an attempt by the far right to gain a foothold among Poles in Britain. By holding events like book fairs and fun runs, extremist groups ""inject their intolerance, their bigotry, and their prejudice into these communities"", he added. ""Let's call it what it is. It's a form of radicalisation."" Mr Rola, the moderator of the Slough discussion, came back to the UK in June to attend another edition of the book fair - this time in Leeds. This one was not funded by the Polish Embassy but was organised by the same group, Polska Niepodlegla. As soon as he reached arrivals at Luton Airport, he tweeted a photograph captioned: ""They didn't even frisk us."" Asked about Mr Rola's case, the Home Office refused to comment. A spokesman said the government is ""taking a comprehensive approach to defeat the scourge of extremism by supporting communities to promote our common values and confront extremism wherever it exists"".

Narcissists 'irritating but successful',"Narcissists might be irritating attention seekers - but they are also annoyingly likely to be successful, according to researchers. Even though their personality traits might seem negative, psychologists say their sense of superiority gives them a ""mental toughness"" not to give up. An international team of researchers says narcissists tend to come out on top in education, work and romance. Their ""heightened sense of self-worth"" gives them great self-confidence. For psychologists, narcissism is one of the ""dark triad"" of malevolent personality traits, along with psychopathy and Machiavellianism - with narcissists having a tendency to be self-centred, vain, grandiose and to need the admiration of others. Narcissism 'short-lived way to popularity' Why we should pity attention-seeking narcissists But Dr Kostas Papageorgiou, from Queen's University Belfast, says research shows that narcissists are often socially successful and undeterred by rejection and their craving for attention can make them ""charming"" and highly motivated. Narcissists can have an exaggerated view of their own importance ""If we could abandon conventional social morality - and just focus on what is successful,"" he says, then narcissism can look like a very ""positive"" trait. ""If you are a narcissist you believe strongly that you are better than anyone else and that you deserve reward,"" says the psychologist. This might be unbearable for everyone else around them, but Dr Papageorgiou says this kind of boundless self-belief is also linked to being ""mentally tough"" and a readiness to ""embrace challenges"". The ""power"" of narcissism is currently on public view, he says, in the prevalence of narcissistic behaviour in popular culture, whether on social media, reality television or in politics. Dr Papageorgiou is part of a research team including academics from Goldsmiths, the University of London, King's College London, University of Texas at Austin and Manchester Metropolitan University, which used performance in secondary school exams to show how narcissists could overtake people who had more ability than them. It is ""all about me"" for narcissists Using a sample of more than 300 young people identified as narcissists in secondary school in Italy, the researchers found that they tended to score much better in exams than would have been expected from other tests of their intelligence. Psychologists said that as well as traits such as egotism and the need to dominate, these narcissists had high levels of resilience and determination. They were not cleverer, but were more confident and assertive and were able to overtake students who otherwise would have more ability. Dr Papageorgiou says this pattern of advantage at school carries through to university and work - and also in romance. He says that narcissists are likely to attract more partners. ""They're quite charismatic. If you spend a lot of time trying to be charming and persuade other people, it might well make you more attractive, says Dr Papageorgiou. He says there could even be an evolutionary element to what he says is a rise in narcissism, with narcissists having more sexual partners and passing on their genes to more people. Dr Papageorgiou says about 60% of narcissism is inherited, with the rest shaped by the environment. Narcissists can be ""absolutely destructive for those around them"", says the psychologist, but there is nothing inevitable about this and they can limit the impact of these character traits. ""You can control them, rather than let them control you,"" he says. Dr Papageorgiou argues that such personality traits should not be seen as ""either good or bad"" but as ""products of evolution"" and ""expressions of human nature"".

Little House author removed from book award,"A photograph of Wilder in 1887 while she worked as a schoolteacher The US Association for Library Service to Children (ALSC) has removed Laura Ingalls Wilder's name from one of its awards over racist views and language. The association had received complaints for years over the Little House on the Prairie author's ""anti-Native and anti-Black sentiments in her work"". The ALSC board voted unanimously on Saturday to remove Wilder's name from the children's literature award. The medal will be renamed as the Children's Literature Legacy award. The ALSC, a division of the American Library Association, said Wilder's novels and ""expressions of stereotypical attitudes"" were ""inconsistent with ALSC's core values"". Wilder's children's novels about pioneer life in the American West have been criticised for language that dehumanises indigenous peoples and people of colour. This video can not be played Racism in the US: Is there a single step that can bring equality? Notably, one of the opening chapters of the Little House books described a land with ""no people. Only Indians lived there"". In 1953, the Harper's publishing company decided to change ""people"" to ""settlers"",according to the Washington Post,external. Why the fuss over Confederate statues? Einstein diaries reveal racist stereotypes Memphis 'punished' for statue removal But the novels continues to raise concerns due to storylines featuring racist stereotypes and attitudes typical of white Americans of Wilder's era. ""The only good Indian is a dead Indian,"" one character says. At other points in the series, African-American characters are called ""darkies"". Some fans of the novels say they offer an important historical perspective and should be used as teaching tools for children. The letter from the ALSC board noted the ""complexity"" of this issue and ""the emotion surrounding it"". ""We acknowledge that Wilder's books not only hold a significant place in the history of children's literature and continue to be read today,""the board's recommendation reads,external. ""We also acknowledge that they have been deeply painful to many readers."" Democrats have called for Confederate monuments to be removed from Capitol Hill in Washington Born in 1867, Wilder was known for her semi-autobiographical Little House on the Prairie novels - a series published between 1932 and 1943. The novels were adapted to a television series in 1974, running until 1983. E B White and Dr Seuss are both famous recipients of the Wilder Award. The decision to remove Wilder from this literary award is the latest move to revise cultural tributes to racist historical figures in the US. The removal of Confederate memorials by local governments across the country has triggered backlash from some Americans who believe it subverts US history and southern culture. Racial minorities, especially black Americans, feel that the presence of Confederate symbols in public life is offensive.

Pig welfare at risk as COâ shortage bites,"Scotland's biggest pig processor is set to run out of carbon dioxide on Tuesday, leaving it in danger of welfare issues such as overcrowding. The gas, which is used to stun farm animals and put the fizz in carbonated drinks, is in short supply in Europe. Quality Pork Limited, which puts about 6,000 pigs a week through its abattoir in Brechin, may have to send some animals to England. However, its sister plant in England is also facing CO2 shortages. Food and drinks firms are scaling back operations because of a shortage of CO2. CO2: The build up of a gas problem Are we in for a beer shortage this summer? CO2 shortage: Food industry calls for government action At least five gas producers in northern Europe have been offline for maintenance,according to the publication Gasworld,external. And seasonal maintenance shutdowns have left the UK with only one big CO2 producer in action. Quality Pork Limited, which operates in collaboration with UK-wide meat processor Tulip and the Scottish Pork Producers (SPP) co-operative, uses CO2 as part of a pre-slaughter stunning process. It will run out of the gas on Tuesday. SPP chief executive Andy McGowan told the BBC that the abattoir would start to see animal welfare issues develop within a few days because of overcrowding. ""We can send some pigs to England, to our sister factories at Tulip. But that is not a long-term solution. They, too, are seeing CO2 shortages,"" he said. Mr McGowan said he had little idea when CO2 shipments would resume. ""One of the challenges is that we are not getting any sort of commitment from the gas companies. It makes planning difficult"". Tulip said it had sought approval from regulators so that Scottish pigs processed in its English abattoirs could still carry a Quality Meat Scotland kitemark. ""We remain extremely concerned about the lack of CO2,"" said a spokesman for Tulip. ""We are in regular communication with our supply partnersâ¦ although there is currently very limited information."" Drink-makers have also been hit by the shortage. On Monday, Coca-Cola said it had ""temporarily paused"" some production while the Holden's beer bottling company in the West Midlands said its facility in Dudley stopped work on Friday. Mark Hammond, operations director at the Holden's bottling plant, said ""We are going to do maintenance and a deep clean. But as of [Monday] morning, we have 25 people sitting around doing nothing."" He said ""CO2 is an absolutely vital component. It's the equivalent of diesel in the haulage industry."" The plant does not just bottle Holden's beer but has about 80 customers. Mr Hammond has no idea when his supplies might resume. Although the gas industry says things will start returning to normal in early July, he fears firms like his will be at the back of the queue for fresh supplies. ""We are a small firm, and there's obviously great demand across the sector,"" he said. ""We are not getting good communication from CO2 suppliers."" The meat industry hopes that it will be given delivery priority as more CO2 supplies come onto the market. ""Our processors deal with live animals,"" said the UK's Meat Processors' Association. ""The CO2 shortage has the potential to become an animal welfare issue. We have been asking to be treated as a priority."" The British Poultry Association (BPA) said: ""We are involved with live animals. They are a priority."" A BPA spokesman said many of his members had only enough CO2 ""to keep ticking over"". He added: ""We are maintaining production by stretching our gas. But people are living day-to-day."" However, small firms fear they will be a low priority when suppliers ramp up distribution for their big customers. Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, said the CO2 shortage could disrupt hundreds of small suppliers. ""This unexpected disruption will cause a shockwave throughout many supply chains with smaller firms lower down being the first hit and the last to recover."" However, bigger firms are also feeling the squeeze. On Monday, Coca-Cola said its soft drinks production line was disrupted by carbon dioxide shortages, although supplies to customers have not been affected. The company said: ""We are working closely with our suppliers, partners and customers on a number of solutions as the situation develops."" Last week, drinks giant Heineken said its John Smith's Extra Smooth and Amstel had already been hit. The company said on Monday that it had no fresh information on when things might return to normal. ""We are still working through the issue with customers and trying to minimise disruption,"" said a spokeswoman. 'Urgent action needed' over CO2 shortage Are we in for a beer shortage this summer?

ÃÂ£1.3bn tidal lagoon project thrown out,"The Hendry review said the lagoon would make a ""strong contribution"" to energy supplies Plans to build the world's first tidal power lagoon have been thrown out by the UK government. Business and Energy Secretary Greg Clark said the Â£1.3bn project was not value for money, despite claims by developers Tidal Lagoon Power (TLP)a revised offer made it cheaper. The decision has beenslammed by local politiciansacross the parties, including the Conservatives. The scheme off Swansea Bay hadÂ£200m backing from the Welsh Government. But the UK government said it would not pay TLP the fee it wants for energy. TLP claimed no talks have taken place for more than a year and saidsupporters of the project have vowed to do what they can to make it a reality. How the tidal lagoon numbers crunched Lagoon decision 'crushing blow' for Wales Another 'kick in the teeth' for Swansea Q&A: Swansea Bay tidal lagoon Mr Clarktold the Commons,external: ""Securing our energy needs into the future has to be done seriously and, when much cheaper alternatives exist, no individual project, and no particular technology, can proceed at any price."" Government analysis estimated that the lagoon would cost the average British household consumer an additional Â£700 between 2031 and 2050. But TLP chief executive Mark Shorrock said the figures were wrong, adding that offshore wind projects had received Â£8bn in subsidies and the ""path finder"" tidal lagoon project needed Â£25m a year ""in order to kick start an industry"". ""It's a very, very sad day for Wales, for Swansea,"" he told BBC Radio Wales'Good Evening Walesprogramme. First Minister Carwyn Jonestweeted,externalthat it was a ""crushing blow to Wales"". This video can not be played Carolyn Harris: ""You will never understand the frustration and anger in my city"" Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said: ""I realise the disappointment this decision may cause, but ultimately this project did not meet the threshold for taxpayer value."" There have been a number of calls among Labour MPs for Mr Cairns to go but he told theBBC Wales Todayprogramme he was proud of his record. Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford, speaking in an interview on Good Evening Wales, said: ""Wales has not had an effective voice at the cabinet table."" Plaid Cymru's energy spokesperson, Liz Saville Roberts MP, said the UK government's ""decision demonstrates the need for Wales to gain greater control over its own future"". Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds called the decision a ""disgrace"", as did Gower Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi. The announcement brings an end to 18 months of waiting sincean independent review, commissioned by the ministers, recommended building the lagoon. TLP chairman Keith Clarke said: ""In light of today's statement and having heard next to nothing from government for two years, the board will be meeting in two days' time to consider its next steps."" This video can not be played Greg Clark said the lagoon did not meet ""value for money"" requirements The review by former energy minister Charles Hendry said Swansea should be used as a test of the technology, before allowing other developers to bid to construct further schemes as part of a competitive tendering process. The UK government has been accused of dragging its heels since then, during which time they repeatedly stated the scheme must prove ""value for money"". TLP claims the Swansea project would provide power to 155,000 properties in Wales and is cheaper than nuclear power. The developers had previously asked for a 90-year contract with the UK government with an average strike price - a guaranteed price for the electricity generated - of Â£89.90 per megawatt hour. The new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point C in Somerset was given a strike price of Â£92.50/MWh for 35 years. This video can not be played Watch Tidal Lagoon Power's video of how the turbines would work Analysis by Brian Meechan, BBC Wales business correspondent This was a project that seemed at one point to have widespread and almost universal support in Wales. It required the UK government to agree a significant strike price - a subsidy paid by consumers through energy bills - although the exact amount varied depending on the length of time that price was set for and whether other taxpayer funding was invested in the project. The independent report by Charles Hendry was very supportive of the tidal lagoon. However, it also said that doing a full, value for money, assessment was beyond its scope. In recent months, some in the business community have been privately raising concerns about the cost of the project and its impact on energy bills. While Tidal Lagoon Power and the Welsh Government now say it is the same price as nuclear power, the UK government insist it is double. However, the goalposts have moved. There was huge criticism of the UK government over the price for energy struck for the new nuclear plant across the water at Hinkley Point. With a pledge not to commit bill payers to such costs again, even getting the cost of the lagoon to a similar figure was unlikely to be good enough. It seems, ultimately, that UK ministers do not have confidence that the lagoon developers are able to deliver the project at the price they now think is reasonable for consumers to pay. Especially as other options such as wind energy come in at a much lower cost. 2003: Plans first emerge for a Â£30m tidal power project in Swansea Bay from a green energy charity 2006: Tidal Electric Ltd prepares a scoping report for a lagoon to take the project on but it is put on hold 2012: Tidal Lagoon Power (TLP) unveils its ambition to develop a breakwater and power generation 2013: TLP starts developing its plans 2014: Plans submitted to Planning Inspectorate with a cost of Â£850m 2015: Proposals get backing of UK government, subject to subsidy agreement - hope it could be operational by 2018 2016: Report warns of impact on fish.

Welsh Government also offers substantial investment, as does Wales Pension Partnership Ian Price, director of business group CBI Wales, said: ""We appreciate the effort and energy made by politicians from both governments who have worked tirelessly to try and make this project a reality. At the end of the day, any project has to be affordable for consumers.""

US relaxes 'zero tolerance' on migrants,"This video can not be played The cost of detention v the alternatives A US border security chief says he has temporarily stopped launching criminal prosecutions of migrants who illegally enter the country with children. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Commissioner Kevin McAleenan told reporters in Texas the prosecution referrals were suspended last week. He said it followed an order last week by President Donald Trump calling for an end to migrant family separations. But Mr Trump had suggested the families would instead be detained together. The Republican president bowed to public pressure last Wednesday, signing his executive order to ""keep families together"" in migrant detentions. Mr McAleenan maintained that the Trump administration's ""zero tolerance"" tactics were still in effect, although the commissioner's guidance to his agents largely leaves the policy in limbo. Migrant families separation: The big picture explained Child migrant photo not what it seemed Migrant families face chaos to reunite The CBP chief said parents cannot be prosecuted if US officials no longer intend to separate them from their children, who are legally not allowed to be kept in adult detention facilities. He said his agency and the Department of Justice must figure out how to prosecute the parents without splitting them from their children, the Associated Press news agency reported. The border official's decision paves the way for US immigration enforcement to revert largely to the approach under the Obama administration. This video can not be played Drone footage shows a ""tent city"" immigration centre It means US border agents who stop undocumented adult migrants accompanied by children will hand them a court summons and allow them to go on their way, rather than hold them in a detention facility. Adults unaccompanied by children will still be detained. Mr Trump repeatedly lamented this ""catch and release"" policy before his administration began in April criminally prosecuting adult migrants and holding their children separately to deter border crossings. The impact of Trump on illegal immigration US 'plans migrant camps on military bases' Trump hosts victims of illegal migrants On Monday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the reality was that the US did not have the space to hold all the undocumented families coming across the US-Mexico border. ""We're not changing the policy,"" she told reporters. ""We're simply out of resources."" Mr Trump earlier said that the US needed ""a nice simple system that works"". ""We want a system where, when people come in illegally, they have to go out,"" he said. The Pentagon confirmed on Monday that two Texas military bases will be used as temporary camps to house the immigrants. But Defence Secretary Jim Mattis did not specify whether the facilities - Fort Bliss and Goodfellow Air Force Base - would house migrant families together. US media earlier reported that one of the bases would be used to house migrant families and the other would shelter undocumented children who enter the US unaccompanied by an adult. Meanwhile, US Attorney General Jeff Sessions talked tough on immigration at a school police officers' conference in Reno, Nevada, on Monday. This video can not be played Cisary Reynaud has not spoken to his daughter since they were separated America's top law official said that refusing to prosecute adults who illegally enter the US ""would be a disservice to the people of this country"", reports the New York Times. He told the audience that lax border enforcement would ""encourage more adults to bring more children illegally"". However, he also said the Trump administration would ""do everything in our power to avoid separating families"". The government has yet to reunite parents with more than 2,000 children who have been taken away since last month and sent to holding cells, converted warehouses, desert tents or foster care around the US. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sought a federal court injunction in San Diego, California, on Monday to stop the administration from separating undocumented immigrant parents from their children. President Trump signed an executive order halting separations but thousands of children remain separated from their families It said that Mr Trump's order to end separations contained ""loopholes"". Court papers filed by the ACLU contained numerous accounts of parents unable to locate or communicate with their children after they were separated by border officials. In one declaration filed with the brief, a mother identified only by her initials E.J.O.E. said the government told her she would be reunited with her son as she applied for asylum. But she says she was deported without her eight-year-old boy. More than 20 separated children are at a US government tent camp in Tornillo, Texas. CBS News, which was allowed to tour the facility, said the commander in charge described the ""zero tolerance"" policy as ""a dumb, stupid decision that should've never happened"".

Â£1.3bn tidal lagoon project thrown out,"The Hendry review said the lagoon would make a ""strong contribution"" to energy supplies Plans to build the world's first tidal power lagoon have been thrown out by the UK government. Business and Energy Secretary Greg Clark said the Â£1.3bn project was not value for money, despite claims by developers Tidal Lagoon Power (TLP)a revised offer made it cheaper. The decision has beenslammed by local politiciansacross the parties, including the Conservatives. The scheme off Swansea Bay hadÂ£200m backing from the Welsh Government. But the UK government said it would not pay TLP the fee it wants for energy. TLP claimed no talks have taken place for more than a year and saidsupporters of the project have vowed to do what they can to make it a reality. How the tidal lagoon numbers crunched Lagoon decision 'crushing blow' for Wales Another 'kick in the teeth' for Swansea Q&A: Swansea Bay tidal lagoon Mr Clarktold the Commons,external: ""Securing our energy needs into the future has to be done seriously and, when much cheaper alternatives exist, no individual project, and no particular technology, can proceed at any price."" Government analysis estimated that the lagoon would cost the average British household consumer an additional Â£700 between 2031 and 2050. But TLP chief executive Mark Shorrock said the figures were wrong, adding that offshore wind projects had received Â£8bn in subsidies and the ""path finder"" tidal lagoon project needed Â£25m a year ""in order to kick start an industry"". ""It's a very, very sad day for Wales, for Swansea,"" he told BBC Radio Wales'Good Evening Walesprogramme. First Minister Carwyn Jonestweeted,externalthat it was a ""crushing blow to Wales"". This video can not be played Carolyn Harris: ""You will never understand the frustration and anger in my city"" Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said: ""I realise the disappointment this decision may cause, but ultimately this project did not meet the threshold for taxpayer value."" There have been a number of calls among Labour MPs for Mr Cairns to go but he told theBBC Wales Todayprogramme he was proud of his record. Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford, speaking in an interview on Good Evening Wales, said: ""Wales has not had an effective voice at the cabinet table."" Plaid Cymru's energy spokesperson, Liz Saville Roberts MP, said the UK government's ""decision demonstrates the need for Wales to gain greater control over its own future"". Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds called the decision a ""disgrace"", as did Gower Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi. The announcement brings an end to 18 months of waiting sincean independent review, commissioned by the ministers, recommended building the lagoon. TLP chairman Keith Clarke said: ""In light of today's statement and having heard next to nothing from government for two years, the board will be meeting in two days' time to consider its next steps."" This video can not be played Greg Clark said the lagoon did not meet ""value for money"" requirements The review by former energy minister Charles Hendry said Swansea should be used as a test of the technology, before allowing other developers to bid to construct further schemes as part of a competitive tendering process. The UK government has been accused of dragging its heels since then, during which time they repeatedly stated the scheme must prove ""value for money"". TLP claims the Swansea project would provide power to 155,000 properties in Wales and is cheaper than nuclear power. The developers had previously asked for a 90-year contract with the UK government with an average strike price - a guaranteed price for the electricity generated - of Â£89.90 per megawatt hour. The new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point C in Somerset was given a strike price of Â£92.50/MWh for 35 years. This video can not be played Watch Tidal Lagoon Power's video of how the turbines would work Analysis by Brian Meechan, BBC Wales business correspondent This was a project that seemed at one point to have widespread and almost universal support in Wales. It required the UK government to agree a significant strike price - a subsidy paid by consumers through energy bills - although the exact amount varied depending on the length of time that price was set for and whether other taxpayer funding was invested in the project. The independent report by Charles Hendry was very supportive of the tidal lagoon. However, it also said that doing a full, value for money, assessment was beyond its scope. In recent months, some in the business community have been privately raising concerns about the cost of the project and its impact on energy bills. While Tidal Lagoon Power and the Welsh Government now say it is the same price as nuclear power, the UK government insist it is double. However, the goalposts have moved. There was huge criticism of the UK government over the price for energy struck for the new nuclear plant across the water at Hinkley Point. With a pledge not to commit bill payers to such costs again, even getting the cost of the lagoon to a similar figure was unlikely to be good enough. It seems, ultimately, that UK ministers do not have confidence that the lagoon developers are able to deliver the project at the price they now think is reasonable for consumers to pay. Especially as other options such as wind energy come in at a much lower cost. 2003: Plans first emerge for a Â£30m tidal power project in Swansea Bay from a green energy charity 2006: Tidal Electric Ltd prepares a scoping report for a lagoon to take the project on but it is put on hold 2012: Tidal Lagoon Power (TLP) unveils its ambition to develop a breakwater and power generation 2013: TLP starts developing its plans 2014: Plans submitted to Planning Inspectorate with a cost of Â£850m 2015: Proposals get backing of UK government, subject to subsidy agreement - hope it could be operational by 2018 2016: Report warns of impact on fish. Charles Hendry is appointed to lead independent review into Â£1.3bn lagoon's viability 2017: Hendry review backs the lagoon as a ""no regrets"" option but the UK government is still to decide 2018: Delays, mostly believed to be over arguments over value for money. Welsh Government also offers substantial investment, as does Wales Pension Partnership Ian Price, director of business group CBI Wales, said: ""We appreciate the effort and energy made by politicians from both governments who have worked tirelessly to try and make this project a reality. At the end of the day, any project has to be affordable for consumers."" David Clubb, a director at RenewableUK Cymru, the trade body for all renewable energy, said: ""This means that the region will not benefit from many thousands of jobs from the project and the associated supply chain.""

"Women's top reproductive worries revealedPeriods, the menopause, sexually transmitted infections or fertility? What do women say?Health","Almost half of women aged 25-34 do not have an enjoyable sex life, a survey byPublic Health England,externalsuggests. About 7,000 women over the age of 16 responded to the first poll of its kind launched by the health body to guide future policy on reproductive health. Sexual satisfaction appeared to increase with age - less than a third of women aged 55-64 reported a lack of enjoyable sex in the past 12 months. Avoiding an unwanted pregnancy was the women's biggest concern overall. Managing painful, heavy periods was the third most common reproductive worry, while having an enjoyable sex life was second. Going for reproductive health screening, including smear tests, was fourth, ""Other"" reproductive health symptoms was fifth. And difficulty getting pregnant was sixth. Catching a sexually transmitted disease was seventh on the list. What happens during a smear test? Different issues took on relatively greater or lesser importance at different stages of a woman's life. The women who responded were aged 16 and older and living in England. Around 65% of the women reported having sex in the last month. A further 12% had had sex in the previous three months. Among other findings: Most women who were sexually active were using at least one method of contraception About a third of women currently using contraception reported using a coil (intra-uterine device) or implant Another third said they were using the pill Condoms were also a popular but not necessarily regular choice 12% of 16- to 24 year-olds said they did not use any regular contraception, compared with 33% of 35- to 44-year-olds and 45% of 45- to 54-year-olds About a third of the women had experienced severe reproductive health symptoms in the past 12 months, ranging from heavy menstrual bleeding to menopause, and incontinence to infertility. In-depth interviews revealed that these symptoms often affected women's ability to carry out daily activities, yet many concealed their symptoms from work colleagues. Embarrassment commonly acted as a barrier to accessing knowledge or support. Angela says reproductive health is still a taboo topic Angela Kilcoyne, who took part in a PHE focus group, said: ""Since I was 13, I have felt embarrassed about having heavy menstrual bleeding - a health issue which has caused me debilitating pain and nausea. I worked for years in banking, which was a very male dominated environment, and I never told my managers that I was off due to horrendous period pain. ""I would have to invent reasons month after month and soldier on. Or I would dose myself up and try and get through the day best I could, then collapse when I got home. Reproductive health should be spoken about in the workplace in the same way as sickness or flu."" Dr Sue Mann, public health consultant in reproductive health, from Public Health England, said: ""Enjoying a fulfilling sex life is important for women's mental and emotional wellbeing. Our data show that sexual enjoyment is a key part of good reproductive health and that while many women are reporting sexual dysfunction, many are not seeking help. ""Our research shows that there is still stigma associated with talking about reproductive health issues which is a barrier to women seeking help. This is particularly true in the workplace where many women do not feel comfortable speaking to their managers about the real reasons for needing to take time off work. We want to empower women to educate themselves about good reproductive health and to feel confident speaking about it.""

"Fire chief 'untrained' in tower evacuationThe fire service has been criticised for telling Grenfell residents to ""stay put"" in their flats.UK","This video can not be played Michael Dowden pausing before answering a question on Monday The firefighter who led the initial response to the Grenfell fire said he was not trained to decide when to abandon the policy of ""stay put"" and evacuate a burning tower instead. Michael Dowden told the inquiry he was ""out of his comfort zone"" when faced with the spreading blaze. He also admitted failing to follow national guidance when carrying out safety checks on the tower in 2016. Cladding, sprinklers, radio blackspots and escape routes were not checked. At times during his appearance before the inquiry, Mr Dowden left long pauses - up to 25 seconds - before giving his answers. Monday's hearing ended early as he felt unable to continue after more than six hours of questioning. Grenfell Inquiry: What five reports reveal Why was 'stay put' advice so disastrous? Why are people told to 'stay put'? Grenfell Tower: What happened Mr Dowden, watch manager at North Kensington fire station, visited Grenfell Tower in February 2016 - 16 months before the fire that killed 72 people. He was asked at the inquiry: Whether he was aware of guidance issued by the London Fire Brigade in July 2016 which stressed the ""need to understand what products are being used in the facade system and their fire behaviour"". Mr Dowden replied: ""No, no I wasn't"" Whether on his inspection, he assessed the evacuation procedures for the tower. He replied: ""I cannot recall that I did, no"" Whether he investigated if there were people in the block whose grasp of English potentially ""obstructed"" the evacuation advice in place. Mr Dowden said: ""I cannot recall"" Whether he checked the sprinkler system. Mr Dowden said: ""No"" Mr Dowden said he did familiarise himself with the dry riser system - the means by which fire crews get water up a tall building. However, they should not be used in buildings above 50m - Grenfell is 67m. Asked whether he had thought during his visit, ""this building exceeds 50 metres, what's it doing with a dry riser?"" Mr Dowden replied, ""No, I didn't."" The first firefighters arrived at Grenfell Tower just before 01:00 on 14 June 2017 By Tom Symonds, home affairs correspondent This is not a court.  Watch manager Michael Dowden is not accused of anything and stood today in his dress uniform to provide facts, not to defend himself. But what he said raises deep questions about the degree to which the London Fire Brigade was prepared for the inferno on 14 June 2017. It is expected (in government guidance) to specifically assess the risk of fires in tall buildings, fuelled by cladding, and to train its commanders to make the decisions needed to switch from a ""stay-put"" policy to ""everyone out"". Mr Dowden's evidence is that not a lot of that has happened.  Other firefighters will give evidence shortly, but he was in charge for the critical golden hour when perhaps the fire could have been stopped and the building evacuated.  If anyone needed that training and prior planning, it was him. His evidence is vital for an inquiry determined to learn the lessons of this tragedy. But lurking in the background is a police inquiry looking for evidence of corporate criminality, potentially breaches of health and safety by the fire service.  His evidence will be vital to that process too. Mr Dowden was also questioned at length about his training, particularly around high-rise flats and the brigade's adherence to a stay-put policy for the residents. Most towers are designed so fires can be contained in the flats where they start, but this did not happen at Grenfell Tower, with the external cladding cited as the""primary cause""of the fire spreading. One expert has said thefire service should have abandoned its adviceto residents to stay in their flats much earlier than it did. Victims' families have also been critical of the advice. Counsel for the inquiry Richard Millett said according to policy, incident commanders ""should understand"" when an evacuation would be necessary and asked Mr Dowden what training he had for that situation. After a 17-second pause, Mr Dowden said: ""I can't remember any time when I'd actually been on a training course that would facilitate that."" He said it was ""very difficult"" to rehearse high-rise fire responses as ""we don't have a high-rise facility to train on"". Mr Dowden added the advice to residents was ""borne out of the way a building should behave in a fire"". This video can not be played Grenfell Tower inquiry: What questions will be answered? Mr Dowden, who has been a firefighter for 14 years, said he had not realised the tower's exterior cladding could spread a fire. He was also asked if he had looked at the cladding on his visit in February 2016. ""That's something I didn't look at,"" he said, but he added: ""Knowing what I know now, that is certainly something I would look at."" Turning to the night of the fire, Mr Dowden was asked about what information he got from the fire brigade's mobile database en route to the tower block. He said he could ""only presume"" the building information he was working off that night was a floor plan written in 2009 that did not include an extra three floors installed in the 23-floor building in a re-fit. The information also said Grenfell had a ""stay-put"" policy. The fire officer said in his written statement that the inferno quickly moved outside his ""comfort zone"" as an incident commander. A short while later, the hearing took a break. But when it resumed, Mr Millett said he had been told Mr Dowden was unable to continue answering questions on the day. Inquiry chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick said he had been ""becoming increasingly concerned"" that Mr Dowden, who insisted on standing throughout the hearing, was finding it a ""difficult exercise"" and said arrangements for his evidence should be considered before the night of the fire is discussed further.

NHS 'no longer the envy of the world',"The NHS lags behind other countries when it comes to treating common, life-threatening illnesses, an independent analysis produced for the BBC says. Thereport,external- to mark the NHS's 70th birthday - said the UK was a ""below-average"" performer on preventing deaths from heart attacks, strokes and cancer. But it does get less funding than services in the other 18 nations studied, the experts pointed out. The analysis also said there were some ""definite strengths"". These included providing ""unusually good financial protection"" from the consequences of ill-health and being relatively efficient. The experts behind the analysis - one of five produced to mark the anniversary, on 5 July - described the NHS as a ""perfectly ordinary"" service produced for a ""middling level of cost"". It contrasted this with the boast by Nye Bevan, the minister who oversaw the creation of the NHS in 1948, that the service was the ""envy of the world"", at a time when few countries had a universal health system. Is the NHS a champion or an also-ran? The history of the NHS in charts Nick Robinson: Let's be honest about the NHS Forget 70 - what will the NHS look like at 100? ""We run a health system with very scarce resources in terms of staff and equipment and achieve poor outcomes in some vital areas like cancer survival,"" said Nigel Edwards, chief executive of the Nuffield Trust think tank. His team worked with experts at the King's Fund, Health Foundation and Institute for Fiscal Studies to look at key issues facing the NHS at this key milestone. Alongside this, they have produced reports looking a finances, social care, technology and the health of the nation, for the BBC. The topics will be discussed on theBBC Two show NHS at 70 - Liveon Tuesday at 20:00.

The think tanks looked at performance on the 12 most common causes of death. It found the NHS performed worse than average on eight of them: Breast cancer Colorectal cancer Lung cancer Pancreatic cancer Lung disease Respiratory infections (such as pneumonia) Stroke Heart attacks The NHS also had consistently higher rates of death for babies at birth or just after and in the first month of life. But there were some encouraging signs - it was performing better on kidney disease in terms of transplants and diabetes by preventing amputations, for example. There was also lower rates of suicides. The picture on dementia was unclear, the report. The experts said societal factors, such as high income inequality or poor health of the population, may also be influencing the poor performance. The analysis said it seemed ""plausible"" that poor performance was to some extent a consequence of relatively low levels of funding that meant there was fewer resources. Just over Â£3,100 per person per year is spent on health care in the UK, compared with an average of Â£3,500. This meant there were fewer doctors and nurses per head than in many countries. It also said the health service had ""very low levels"" of hospital beds and the lowest levels of CT and MRI scanners. The experts blamed this on a lack of investment, saying austerity had ""bitten hard"". Since 2010, the budget rises in the NHS have hovered between 1% and 2% a year - compared with the close to 4% it has traditionally enjoyed. The most positive element of the international comparison by far was that which related to affordability. Because of the nature of the NHS, the authors said, it provided good financial protection against the consequences of ill-health. For example, it had the lowest proportion of people who skipped medicines due to cost - 2.3% compared with a 7.2% average - and pretty low numbers who missed consultations for financial reasons. It was also among the best for proportion of income spent on health care. On accessibility, the report said waiting times in the NHS were roughly in line with others, while patient experience compared well. Vaccination rates against illnesses such as measles and flu were high. Jennifer Dixon, of the Health Foundation, said the UK should be ""proud"" cost was not something people feared. But she added: ""If we want to hold our head up high next to our European neighbours, we can and must do better."" The Department for Health and Social Care said the analysis contrasted witha Commonwealth Fund report that rated the NHS the ""best and safest""system in the world. A spokeswoman said survival rates were improving for a number of conditions and the extra funding recently announced - the budget will grow by Â£20bn a year in England by 2023 - would help make even more progress and ""secure its future"".

Hottest day marks start of heatwave,"The UK has enjoyed - or endured - the hottest weather of the year so far, with temperatures of 30C in London. The country is officiallyexperiencing a heatwave, with more 30C days expected later in the week. Fears that railway tracks could buckle in the heat prompted Network Rail to introduce speed restrictions. Andthe Met Office has issued a yellow health warning,externalfor heatwave conditions between Tuesday morning and Thursday evening. The warning, in the west and north-east of England, means there is an 80% chance of temperatures which could be a risk to health, and is intended to help social and healthcare teams prepare. Ice creams, hot dogs and a weatherman in shorts Met Office forecaster Mark Foster said: ""High pressure is going to dominate this week so we can expect very high levels of pollen and UV."" On Monday the highest temperature of 30.1C was recorded at Hampton waterworks in west London. The year'sprevious record temperature had been 29.1C in Aprilat St James's Park in central London. In Scotland, the highest temperature of 26.7C was recorded in Balmoral, while the same temperature was also reached in Castlederg, Northern Ireland. Temperatures reached 28.7C in Usk, in south-east Wales. You must enable JavaScript to view this content.

""If Scotland and Northern Ireland get above 29C, which they are likely to do by the end of Wednesday, it will be the hottest June day in both countries since 1995."" It's definitely beach weather in Hastings, East Sussex Elephants were sprayed with water to cool down at Chester Zoo St James's Park in central London also recorded 30C temperatures Network Rail said track temperatures could reach as much as 20C above the air temperature, meaning the steel rails can expand markedly. The reduced speeds are intended to lower the force exerted on the track, reducing the risk of buckling. One route affected by the speed limits is the line between London Waterloo and New Malden, in south-west London, where trains will be slowed after 11am each day until Friday. Andy Thomas, managing director of England and Wales at Network Rail, said: ""Our engineers and specialist extreme weather teams are monitoring track-side temperatures at vulnerable locations."" Green -minimum state of vigilance during the summer. Yellow - Alert and readiness- Social and healthcare services are on standby to reduce harm. Amber - Heatwave action- Care services target high-risk groups, like the elderly, with specific help. General advice is given to keep homes cool, drink plenty of fluids, and so on.

"Boy, 3, stung 18 times in bee attack","An apology message was put up after people were stung following the hive move A three-year-old boy was taken to A&E after being stung 18 times by a colony of angry bees. Hundreds of the insects were set loose when efforts to move a hive in Burghfield, Berkshire ""went wrong"". A note put up near the village hall says: ""A hive broke open...we are very sorry if you got stung."" A bee expert said the insects ""would have felt under attack"" and were protecting their home. There was a sting in the tail for residents at about 10:30 BST when hundreds of the insects ""just appeared"" after the failed hive move. Carla Chappell, who runs the market from the village hall, said they made a beeline for people outside, forcing people to take refuge inside for up to four hours. ""If anyone went outside, they just landed on you and stung,"" she added. ""We had an elderly guy come in, he had eight stings on his face and was very shaken. ""I looked out and anybody out there, the bees were just heading for them."" Karen Todd, her husband and three-year-old son were all stung as they walked to the hall. The family spent five hours in A&E while the boy was treated and have now returned home, Mrs Todd said. ""The first thing we knew there were bees just flying at us,"" she added. ""A man dressed in a beekeeper outfit came up and told me to keep walking. ""I could feel my head being stung. ""I counted 18 stings on my three-year-old, and my husband was stung at least 10 times on his face and about 10 times on his body."" WATCH: 'Making memory boxes for my children' 'Aggressive' stags get flight diverted Eighty-two chihuahuas found at house Ian James, from the British Beekeepers Association, said the bees would have stung in defence.

US border agents relax enforcement,"This video can not be played The cost of detention v the alternatives A US border security chief says he has temporarily stopped launching criminal prosecutions of migrants who illegally enter the country with children. Customs and Border Protection (CBP) Commissioner Kevin McAleenan told reporters in Texas the prosecution referrals were suspended last week. He said it followed an order last week by President Donald Trump calling for an end to migrant family separations. But Mr Trump had suggested the families would instead be detained together. The Republican president bowed to public pressure last Wednesday, signing his executive order to ""keep families together"" in migrant detentions. Mr McAleenan maintained that the Trump administration's ""zero tolerance"" tactics were still in effect, although the commissioner's guidance to his agents largely leaves the policy in limbo. Migrant families separation: The big picture explained Child migrant photo not what it seemed Migrant families face chaos to reunite The CBP chief said parents cannot be prosecuted if US officials no longer intend to separate them from their children, who are legally not allowed to be kept in adult detention facilities. He said his agency and the Department of Justice must figure out how to prosecute the parents without splitting them from their children, the Associated Press news agency reported. The border official's decision paves the way for US immigration enforcement to revert largely to the approach under the Obama administration. This video can not be played Drone footage shows a ""tent city"" immigration centre It means US border agents who stop undocumented adult migrants accompanied by children will hand them a court summons and allow them to go on their way, rather than hold them in a detention facility. Adults unaccompanied by children will still be detained. Mr Trump repeatedly lamented this ""catch and release"" policy before his administration began in April criminally prosecuting adult migrants and holding their children separately to deter border crossings. The impact of Trump on illegal immigration US 'plans migrant camps on military bases' Trump hosts victims of illegal migrants On Monday, White House press secretary Sarah Sanders said the reality was that the US did not have the space to hold all the undocumented families coming across the US-Mexico border. ""We're not changing the policy,"" she told reporters. ""We're simply out of resources."" Mr Trump earlier said that the US needed ""a nice simple system that works"". ""We want a system where, when people come in illegally, they have to go out,"" he said. The Pentagon confirmed on Monday that two Texas military bases will be used as temporary camps to house the immigrants. But Defence Secretary Jim Mattis did not specify whether the facilities - Fort Bliss and Goodfellow Air Force Base - would house migrant families together. US media earlier reported that one of the bases would be used to house migrant families and the other would shelter undocumented children who enter the US unaccompanied by an adult. Meanwhile, US Attorney General Jeff Sessions talked tough on immigration at a school police officers' conference in Reno, Nevada, on Monday. This video can not be played Cisary Reynaud has not spoken to his daughter since they were separated America's top law official said that refusing to prosecute adults who illegally enter the US ""would be a disservice to the people of this country"", reports the New York Times. He told the audience that lax border enforcement would ""encourage more adults to bring more children illegally"". However, he also said the Trump administration would ""do everything in our power to avoid separating families"". The government has yet to reunite parents with more than 2,000 children who have been taken away since last month and sent to holding cells, converted warehouses, desert tents or foster care around the US. The American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU) sought a federal court injunction in San Diego, California, on Monday to stop the administration from separating undocumented immigrant parents from their children. President Trump signed an executive order halting separations but thousands of children remain separated from their families It said that Mr Trump's order to end separations contained ""loopholes"". Court papers filed by the ACLU contained numerous accounts of parents unable to locate or communicate with their children after they were separated by border officials. In one declaration filed with the brief, a mother identified only by her initials E.J.O.E. said the government told her she would be reunited with her son as she applied for asylum. But she says she was deported without her eight-year-old boy. More than 20 separated children are at a US government tent camp in Tornillo, Texas. CBS News, which was allowed to tour the facility, said the commander in charge described the ""zero tolerance"" policy as ""a dumb, stupid decision that should've never happened"".

Dealers sold ecstasy to children aged 12,"Craig Banks and Dominic Evans admitted conspiracy to supply ecstasy Two ""despicable"" drug dealers who supplied ecstasy to children as young as 12 have been jailed. More than 20 young people were admitted to hospital after taking the drugs, Liverpool Crown Court heard. Craig Banks, 40, and Dominic Evans, 21, admitted conspiracy to supply ecstasy. Banks, of Wheatland Lane, Seacombe, was jailed for six years and nine months while Evans, of Norman Street, Birkenhead, was sentenced to four years and eight months. Banks - described as ""the senior partner"" - and Evans targeted their victims using mobile phones and social media and recruited some of them to act as go-betweens to sell to their friends. As he sentenced them, judge Norman Wright said: ""People who deal in drugs bring misery, degradation and, not infrequently, death. ""It is an evil trade but in this case, the most serious aspect was the very large number of drugs supplied to children as young as 12, 13 or 14. Selling to children is despicable. ""Not only that, you were prepared to sell and make use of children as conduits to sell to other children"". The youngsters were admitted to Arrowe Park Hospital between March and May last year, the court was told. Police recovered ecstasy tablets, cocaine, amphetamine, cannabis and a drug sold under the name ""Legal X"" Judge Wright said Banks had an ""appalling"" record dating back to 1999, having been jailed previously for drugs offences. The court heard Evans had enjoyed a good upbringing but his life had gone in a ""downward spiral"" after he started taking and dealing drugs. Det Insp Paul Lamb said: ""A number of children were taken to hospital after taking these drugs and it is only by good fortune that we did not have a fatality as a result. ""We know that the children were also sharing the tablets, largely because they are afraid of taking them on their own, but they need to understand that passing a class A drug on to another child amounts to supplying."" A number of children were either cautioned or charged as a result of the investigation. Banks also admitted supplying ecstasy and Evans pleaded guilty to three other charges involving the possession and supply of ecstasy, cannabis and cocaine.

Uruguay beat Russia to win Group A,"This video can not be played World Cup 2018: Uruguay 3-0 Russia highlights Russia's impressive start to the World Cup ended as they had a man sent off and were easily defeated by Uruguay, whose victory means they top Group A. Uruguay will go on to face Portugal in the last 16, while hosts Russia play Spain. There was a party atmosphere around the scorching Samara Arena before kick-off, with fans having travelled from all over the country keen to share in the good feeling surrounding their national team. Russia had scored eight goals in sweeping victories over Saudi Arabia and Egypt and were already guaranteed to progress, but they went behind in their final group match after only 10 minutes when Luis Suarez drilled in a clever low free-kick. It got worse for Stanislav Cherchesov's side when a Diego Laxalt effort from 25 yards was deflected in by Denis Cheryshev, leaving his keeper Igor Akifneev stranded and in the position of having conceded three goals at the tournament without making a save. Akinfeev did then come out to block a Rodrigo Bentancur chance, with Roman Zobnin just scrambling the rebound clear of Edinson Cavani, before Igor Smolnikov picked up a second yellow card and was sent off 35 minutes into his World Cup debut. After the break, Russia's 10 men composed themselves and at least managed to wrest back some control of the match, with Uruguay always looking dangerous but perhaps happy to concede possession and protect their lead. The hosts were rewarded with their best chances of the match, the first to Artem Dzuba, who fired wildly over the bar from inside the box, the second by Fedor Smelov, who dazzled to find space in behind the Uruguay defence but failed to pick out a team-mate with what looked to be an easy cut-back. But the final word was left to Cavani, who put several earlier misses behind him to get his first goal of the tournament by stabbing in from close range after an Akinfeev parry, ensuring Russia finished as runners-up. You could say this was the first time Russia had faced quality opposition at this tournament, and for many the manner of this defeat will mark them out as vulnerable in the next round. Right from the outset, and even at the end when there was very little hope of a comeback emerging, there was much of the same remarkable vocal support from the stands. But on the pitch there was very little of the dynamism we saw from Russia's players in their opening two victories. Almost every set-piece was delivered too long, and there were so many key sloppy passes - like Yuri Gazinskiy's to begin the passage of play that led to Suarez scoring from a free-kick - or Mario Fernandes' when for once early in the second half Uruguay looked like they might be opened up. Perhaps the fact that Russia, the lowest ranked team here at 70 in the world, started this game having already qualified affected their approach. Perhaps it was the oppressive heat. Midfielder Aleksandr Golovin, one of their best performers here so far, was also rested. What is certain is that now, having finished second, Russia will play their next match at Moscow's Luzhniki Stadium, where they beat Saudia Arabia 5-0 in the tournament's opening match. It will be another sell-out partisan crowd. Their opponents there will be Spain - with the 2010 World Cup winners secure their place as Group B winners with a draw against Morocco. This video can not be played Suarez free-kick gives Uruguay early lead There was very little doubt about who would win this game after an early period in which Russia were blown away. Suarez looked determined to impress after his poor opening match against Egypt, and it was his clever low free-kick that set the tone for what was a very comfortable victory. There was plenty of noise from the stands - so Uruguay goalkeeper Fernando Muslera will have had many quieter games in terms of volume - but he had little work to do as he became his country's all-time leading appearance maker at the World Cup. At his 14th match at the tournament, and on the occasion of his 100th cap, Uruguay simply out-performed Russia, and of course were for much of the game a player better off. There was even finally a goal for Cavani right at the end. For a long time it looked like it would not come as the Paris St-Germain striker endured a mostly frustrating evening. He missed three good chances before finally things fell into place as the rebound from an Akinfeev parry landed kindly at his feet. The Uruguay fans stayed long after the final whistle to cheer their team. For them it is three wins from three, but their next match will be a much more serious test. Barcelona striker Luis Suarez moved one goal behind Uruguay's record goalscorer at the World Cup, Oscar Miguez, with his seventh in total and his second in Russia this summer Uruguay have finished as first round group winners for the fifth time, having done so previously in 1930, 1950, 1954 and 2010. Russia are the first European side to fail to top their group as the host nation since Spain in 1982. Russia are now winless in each of their six World Cup matches in which they have conceded the first goal (D1 L5). Uruguay are the first side to win all three of their group games without conceding a single goal since Argentina in 1998 (seven goals scored, none conceded). Uruguay have won three consecutive World Cup matches against European opposition for the first time since a run of four straight victories between 1950 and 1954. Russia's Denis Cheryshev scored the sixth own goal at this year's tournament, the joint-most number of own goals at a single World Cup (also six in 1998). Russian defender Igor Smolnikov is the first outfield player to be sent off for the host nation of a World Cup since Marcel Desailly for France against Brazil in the 1998 final. Edinson Cavani became just the second player to score a goal in three separate World Cup tournaments for Uruguay (2010, 2014 and 2018) after his strike partner Luis Suarez. Fernando Muslera, celebrating his 100th cap in this game, became Uruguay's all-time leading appearance maker at the World Cup (14) overtaking Ladislao Mazurkiewicz. Uruguay coach Oscar Tabarez:""Russia did not push us around, they tried to put us into a corner. Not only did we prevent them from doing that, but we put them in their half of the pitch in the first half. We could have won by even more goals. ""We did not manage to score on certain counter-attacks that we should have. Sometimes the timing wasn't perfect. We need to improve very quickly, because any match in the round of 16 will be extremely difficult. ""The result and to be top of our group pleased me most. We won by a wide margin but I like the fact that we didn't concede. We need to work towards that end. And I liked the dedication and concentration that my team had. They were focused from end to end, the entire squad. They executed the plan."" Russia coach Stanislav Cherchesov:""Even when we had 10 people on the pitch, they were running hard and they wanted to attack more. That's why I brought on a substitute. ""Psychologically, we are well prepared for the next games. ""This is one thing and when you come to the pitch to play the game it's another. This is an art to be prepared at any second.""

Real reason for Boris 'Where's Wally' mystery trip?,"Afghanistan is a long way to go to avoid an embarrassing vote in Parliament. Theabsence of Foreign Secretary Boris Johnsonisn't the only telling thing about the Heathrow debate tonight, which stacks up to be a pretty good snapshot of the odd and confusing place our politics finds itself in at the moment. The Conservatives officially back the policy but are corralling their MPs very strenuously to make sure they don't lose the vote after a minister resigned. One former cabinet minister told me today the ""whipping operation is ridiculous, they were even making sure I was going to be there"". But collective responsibility as it has traditionally functioned is out of the window. Cabinet ministers seem rather to have given up on trying to agree with each other (Heathrow isn't the only matter where there is very public discord). The Labour Party is opposing a policy tonight when it comes to Heathrow that their main backer and dozens of their MPs actually support. The Lib Dems are sticking to their principles of opposing Heathrow but with their size these days are finding it hard to make much noise about it. And the SNP who have been officially supportive of expanding the airport won't vote because they say they haven't had credible guarantees from the government. Clear? All this on aproblem that Westminster has been arguing about for decades. It will pass tonight, but this is only, remember, only, the equivalent of the outline planning permission - gasp. Huge attention in the frothy end of the Westminster bubble has centred on the foreign secretary as - to his colleagues' frustration - it often does. During the first half of the day, much of SW1 engaged in a game of political Where's Wally? Speculation on top of speculation on top of speculation about where Boris Johnson could be. Was he still in his Foreign Office lair? In the air? Hiding in the tearoom of the House of Commons? The one place he was categorically not was chaining himself to bulldozers at Heathrow. Then, in the end, the Afghan foreign ministry gave it away by posting a picture of the foreign secretary and his counterpart together at ameeting in Kabul. Mr Johnson held talks with Afghan minister Hekmat Karzai in Kabul as the debate began The mystery of his whereabouts was solved, but not yet the mystery of the purpose. Afghanistan is not exactly an easy place to head for a quick hello. Several sources in Westminster tonight suggest there was a serious reason. My colleague Jonathan Beale reported last month that thegovernment was considering sending about 400 more troops to Afghanistanto join the 600 or so already there helping train Afghan forces. Sources suggest tonight that the National Security Council will discuss the proposal tomorrow afternoon, with the government potentially approving the move, and a possible announcement in the coming days. The soldiers would not be involved in combat, but helping the Afghans provide more security in Kabul. It is suggested an uplift of 440 would make the UK the third biggest contributor in Afghanistan. It is a very long way from the troop numbers during the days of intense conflict. But a move that could give the UK more authority in the run up to a Nato summit at a time when the debate around our future defence is being intensely fought.

COÃ¢ÂÂ shortage: Coca-Cola pauses production,"Coca-Cola says it has ""temporarily paused"" some production because of the shortage of CO2 gas. However, the soft drinks manufacturer says that so far the shortage has not affected supplies. Last week, the makers of Heineken's John Smith's Extra Smooth and Amstel said supplies had been hit.

Harley to make more bikes outside the US,"Harley-Davidson plans to shift some motorcycle production away from the US to avoid the ""substantial"" burden of European Union tariffs. Last week, the EU imposed retaliatory tariffs on US goods, including bourbon, orange juice and motorcycles. The measures are a response to new US duties on steel and aluminium imports. Wisconsin-based Harley-Davidson said the increased cost from the tariffs threaten its international sales, which it has been trying to expand. EU tariffs on US goods come into force Who is losing out from Trump's tariffs? The company has assembly plants in Australia, Brazil, India and Thailand as well as in the US. It said it would raise investment in its international plants, though it did not say which ones. ""To address the substantial cost of this tariff burden long-term, Harley-Davidson will be implementing a plan to shift production of motorcycles for EU destinations from the US to its international facilities to avoid the tariff burden,"" the company said. Harley-Davidson said it expected the ramp-up in production to take nine to 18 months. US President Donald Trump tweeted his disappointment at Harvey-Davidson's decision which he characterised as the company waving the white flag of defeat. Allow Twitter content?

The company's move is one of the most visible consequences of the trade disputes triggered by Mr Trump's decision to levy tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. Mr Trump says the duties are necessary to protect the US steel and aluminium industries, which are vital to national security. They have drawn retaliation from the EU, Canada, Mexico, India and others while driving up the cost of metals for manufacturers in the US. US companies that range from boat-builders to nail manufacturers have warned about the consequences of escalating trade tensions. However, the tariffs have also helped to spur investment in US steel plants. For example, British-owned GFG Alliance, has said it plans to invest $5bn over several years to reopen a shuttered steel plant in South Carolina. The firm says the move will put about 125 people back to work ""immediately"". Harley-Davidson said the EU's tariffs would add, on average, $2,200 (Â£1,660) to each bike exported to Europe from the US as the import tax increases from 6% to 31%. Harley, which sold nearly 40,000 motorcycles in Europe last year, said it planned to absorb those costs rather than pass them onto customers and risk hurting sales. Shares in the company sank almost 6% after the firm announced its decision, which is expected to add between $30m and $45m to its expenses this year. Harley-Davidson said the tariffs make shifting production ""the only sustainable option to make its motorcycles accessible to customers in the EU and maintain a viable business in Europe"". Harley-Davidson, which has been focused on expanding its overseas sales, said it remained committed to US manufacturing. This video can not be played How hogs and Harleys became weapons in a looming trade war. The company employed about 2,100 people at manufacturing plants in the US at the end of last year. It had already announced plans to close a plant in Kansas City, Missouri - a decision which workers claimed was due to the opening of a new facility in Thailand. Harley-Davidson has disputed those allegations, arguing the move was about boosting overseas sales. In early 2017, President Donald Trump met with executives from Harley-Davidson who he thanked for ""building things in America"". But just over a year later, Harley serves as a sobering example of what happens when Trump's America First trade policy collides with the rest of the world. While Harley-Davidson had been struggling financially well before the EU's retaliatory tariffs went into effect, the import duties of 25% certainly didn't help matters. Allow Twitter content?

It is worth mentioning that Harley could make the decision to shift production because it had chosen, in 2017, to open a new manufacturing plant in Thailand. At the time, the company said it was moving manufacturing there to avoid a different tariff: this one being the 60% duty levied on Thai imports. That decision, of course, was made after Trump decided to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade treaty that Harley had said it supported. All of which goes to show that when it comes to ""winning"" a trade war,  the only certainty is the unintended consequences that inevitably result when decades of trade policy are reversed in a matter of months. United Steelworkers, which represents some Harley employees and has supported some of the president's tariff announcements, said it does not know yet how the company's decision will affect US employment. Michael Bolton, a director at United Steelworkers, said: ""Harley's desire to improve sales both domestically and abroad predates the Trump administration's tariffs, as does the company's willingness to build assembly facilities overseas to avoid tariffs. ""The company built its reputation and image by making motorcycles here, and if the company wants to continue to market itself as an iconic American brand both at home and abroad, it needs to focus on US production,"" he added. Mr Trump had made raising manufacturing employment a goal, but economists warn that the escalating trade tensions are likely to be counter-productive. In addition to the metals tariffs, the Trump administration has also said it will impose tariffs on $34bn of Chinese goods starting on 6 July as punishment for violations of intellectual property protections. China is due to retaliate in kind. Mr Trump has also threatened tariffs on foreign cars and auto parts, arguing that firms should make such products in the US.

Â£1.3bn tidal lagoon project thrown outThe UK government says the project off Swansea Bay is too expensive prompting a backlash in Wales.South West Wales,"The Hendry review said the lagoon would make a ""strong contribution"" to energy supplies Plans to build the world's first tidal power lagoon have been thrown out by the UK government. Business and Energy Secretary Greg Clark said the Â£1.3bn project was not value for money, despite claims by developers Tidal Lagoon Power (TLP)a revised offer made it cheaper. The decision has beenslammed by local politiciansacross the parties, including the Conservatives. The scheme off Swansea Bay hadÂ£200m backing from the Welsh Government. But the UK government said it would not pay TLP the fee it wants for energy. TLP claimed no talks have taken place for more than a year and saidsupporters of the project have vowed to do what they can to make it a reality. How the tidal lagoon numbers crunched Lagoon decision 'crushing blow' for Wales Another 'kick in the teeth' for Swansea Q&A: Swansea Bay tidal lagoon Mr Clarktold the Commons,external: ""Securing our energy needs into the future has to be done seriously and, when much cheaper alternatives exist, no individual project, and no particular technology, can proceed at any price."" Government analysis estimated that the lagoon would cost the average British household consumer an additional Â£700 between 2031 and 2050. But TLP chief executive Mark Shorrock said the figures were wrong, adding that offshore wind projects had received Â£8bn in subsidies and the ""path finder"" tidal lagoon project needed Â£25m a year ""in order to kick start an industry"". ""It's a very, very sad day for Wales, for Swansea,"" he told BBC Radio Wales'Good Evening Walesprogramme. First Minister Carwyn Jonestweeted,externalthat it was a ""crushing blow to Wales"". This video can not be played Carolyn Harris: ""You will never understand the frustration and anger in my city"" Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said: ""I realise the disappointment this decision may cause, but ultimately this project did not meet the threshold for taxpayer value."" There have been a number of calls among Labour MPs for Mr Cairns to go but he told theBBC Wales Todayprogramme he was proud of his record. Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford, speaking in an interview on Good Evening Wales, said: ""Wales has not had an effective voice at the cabinet table."" Plaid Cymru's energy spokesperson, Liz Saville Roberts MP, said the UK government's ""decision demonstrates the need for Wales to gain greater control over its own future"". Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds called the decision a ""disgrace"", as did Gower Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi. The announcement brings an end to 18 months of waiting sincean independent review, commissioned by the ministers, recommended building the lagoon. TLP chairman Keith Clarke said: ""In light of today's statement and having heard next to nothing from government for two years, the board will be meeting in two days' time to consider its next steps."" This video can not be played Greg Clark said the lagoon did not meet ""value for money"" requirements The review by former energy minister Charles Hendry said Swansea should be used as a test of the technology, before allowing other developers to bid to construct further schemes as part of a competitive tendering process. The UK government has been accused of dragging its heels since then, during which time they repeatedly stated the scheme must prove ""value for money"". TLP claims the Swansea project would provide power to 155,000 properties in Wales and is cheaper than nuclear power. The developers had previously asked for a 90-year contract with the UK government with an average strike price - a guaranteed price for the electricity generated - of Â£89.90 per megawatt hour. The new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point C in Somerset was given a strike price of Â£92.50/MWh for 35 years. This video can not be played Watch Tidal Lagoon Power's video of how the turbines would work Analysis by Brian Meechan, BBC Wales business correspondent This was a project that seemed at one point to have widespread and almost universal support in Wales. It required the UK government to agree a significant strike price - a subsidy paid by consumers through energy bills - although the exact amount varied depending on the length of time that price was set for and whether other taxpayer funding was invested in the project. The independent report by Charles Hendry was very supportive of the tidal lagoon. However, it also said that doing a full, value for money, assessment was beyond its scope. In recent months, some in the business community have been privately raising concerns about the cost of the project and its impact on energy bills. While Tidal Lagoon Power and the Welsh Government now say it is the same price as nuclear power, the UK government insist it is double. However, the goalposts have moved. There was huge criticism of the UK government over the price for energy struck for the new nuclear plant across the water at Hinkley Point. With a pledge not to commit bill payers to such costs again, even getting the cost of the lagoon to a similar figure was unlikely to be good enough. It seems, ultimately, that UK ministers do not have confidence that the lagoon developers are able to deliver the project at the price they now think is reasonable for consumers to pay. Especially as other options such as wind energy come in at a much lower cost. 2003: Plans first emerge for a Â£30m tidal power project in Swansea Bay from a green energy charity 2006: Tidal Electric Ltd prepares a scoping report for a lagoon to take the project on but it is put on hold 2012: Tidal Lagoon Power (TLP) unveils its ambition to develop a breakwater and power generation 2013: TLP starts developing its plans 2014: Plans submitted to Planning Inspectorate with a cost of Â£850m 2015: Proposals get backing of UK government, subject to subsidy agreement - hope it could be operational by 2018 2016: Report warns of impact on fish. Charles Hendry is appointed to lead independent review into Â£1.3bn lagoon's viability 2017: Hendry review backs the lagoon as a ""no regrets"" option but the UK government is still to decide 2018: Delays, mostly believed to be over arguments over value for money. Welsh Government also offers substantial investment, as does Wales Pension Partnership Ian Price, director of business group CBI Wales, said: ""We appreciate the effort and energy made by politicians from both governments who have worked tirelessly to try and make this project a reality. At the end of the day, any project has to be affordable for consumers."" David Clubb, a director at RenewableUK Cymru, the trade body for all renewable energy, said: ""This means that the region will not benefit from many thousands of jobs from the project and the associated supply chain.""

Kuenssberg: Real reason for Boris trip?,"Afghanistan is a long way to go to avoid an embarrassing vote in Parliament. Theabsence of Foreign Secretary Boris Johnsonisn't the only telling thing about the Heathrow debate tonight, which stacks up to be a pretty good snapshot of the odd and confusing place our politics finds itself in at the moment. The Conservatives officially back the policy but are corralling their MPs very strenuously to make sure they don't lose the vote after a minister resigned. One former cabinet minister told me today the ""whipping operation is ridiculous, they were even making sure I was going to be there"". But collective responsibility as it has traditionally functioned is out of the window. Cabinet ministers seem rather to have given up on trying to agree with each other (Heathrow isn't the only matter where there is very public discord). The Labour Party is opposing a policy tonight when it comes to Heathrow that their main backer and dozens of their MPs actually support. The Lib Dems are sticking to their principles of opposing Heathrow but with their size these days are finding it hard to make much noise about it. And the SNP who have been officially supportive of expanding the airport won't vote because they say they haven't had credible guarantees from the government. Clear? All this on aproblem that Westminster has been arguing about for decades. It will pass tonight, but this is only, remember, only, the equivalent of the outline planning permission - gasp. Huge attention in the frothy end of the Westminster bubble has centred on the foreign secretary as - to his colleagues' frustration - it often does. During the first half of the day, much of SW1 engaged in a game of political Where's Wally? Speculation on top of speculation on top of speculation about where Boris Johnson could be. Was he still in his Foreign Office lair? In the air? Hiding in the tearoom of the House of Commons? The one place he was categorically not was chaining himself to bulldozers at Heathrow. Then, in the end, the Afghan foreign ministry gave it away by posting a picture of the foreign secretary and his counterpart together at ameeting in Kabul. Mr Johnson held talks with Afghan minister Hekmat Karzai in Kabul as the debate began The mystery of his whereabouts was solved, but not yet the mystery of the purpose. Afghanistan is not exactly an easy place to head for a quick hello. Several sources in Westminster tonight suggest there was a serious reason. My colleague Jonathan Beale reported last month that thegovernment was considering sending about 400 more troops to Afghanistanto join the 600 or so already there helping train Afghan forces. Sources suggest tonight that the National Security Council will discuss the proposal tomorrow afternoon, with the government potentially approving the move, and a possible announcement in the coming days. The soldiers would not be involved in combat, but helping the Afghans provide more security in Kabul. It is suggested an uplift of 440 would make the UK the third biggest contributor in Afghanistan. It is a very long way from the troop numbers during the days of intense conflict. But a move that could give the UK more authority in the run up to a Nato summit at a time when the debate around our future defence is being intensely fought.

Burkinis 'could help girls integrate',"The German minister said the burkini could encourage the integration of Muslim girls in society Germany's family minister has defended the use of the burkini in schools, saying that the swimsuits could help Muslim girls integrate. Earlier this month, a school in western Germany sparked debate after offering burkinis to students who would otherwise not attend swim classes. The burkini has been a controversial topic across Europe. The French city of Cannes was last week ordered to repay a fine given to a woman wearing the garment. The issue began when a school in the state of North Rhine-Westphalia (NRW) bought 20 burkinis - paid for by private donations - for use by its female students, according to the Westdeutsche Allgemeine Zeitung. Fifteen girls who would normally have refused to attend mixed swimming lessons have since been able to take part thanks to the swimwear, which covers the whole body except the face, hands and feet. The school's decision caused outrage among conservative lawmakers in Germany, where over a million refugees, mostly from the Middle East and Afghanistan, have arrived in recent years.

But Family Minister Franziska Giffey, from the centre-left Social Democrats, responded on Sunday by saying: ""The most important thing is the well-being of the children and that means that everyone learns to swim."" She argued it was justified for schools to allow the burkini to be worn in class and warned against portraying the issue ""as the downfall of the West"". Separately, a court in the French city of Nice ruled that an â¬11 (Â£10) fine imposed on a woman wearing a burkini in Cannes two years ago was illegal. The move had come in the wake of a series of incidents includingthe Bastille Day truck attackin Nice. At the time, France introduced a controversial ban on burkinis, which was later lifted in seaside resorts after the top administrative court overturned the decision.

'Crucial' Afghan moment - Johnson,"Boris Johnson has discussed security, counter-extremism and education during a controversial trip to Afghanistan. The foreign secretary held talks with senior ministers in Kabul during and met some of the 650 UK military personnel based there. He said a decision would be made ""very soon"" on whether to increase UK personnel training the Afghan army. He has come under fire for being abroad on the day the UK Parliament votes on whether to back expanding Heathrow. It means he misses the Commons vote on building a new runway, which he has opposed for more than a decade. Kuenssberg: Real reason for mystery trip? Johnson defends missing Heathrow vote Afghan interpreters 'should stay in UK' Afghan security forces 'shrink sharply' Downing Street said last week Mr Johnson would be out of the country for Monday's vote on expanding the UK's largest airport. But his exact whereabouts became clear only a few hours ago, when the Afghan Ministry of Foreign Affairs tweeted pictures of him meeting Deputy Foreign Minister Hekmat Karzai. Allow Twitter content?

Mr Johnson also met the country's President, Ashraf Ghani, as well as Gen John Nicholson, the US officer who leads Nato's training and assistance mission in Afghanistan. Since withdrawing its last combat troops in 2014, the UK has maintained a significant presence in the country, helping to train the Afghan army and police as well as providing development assistance. The UK has said continued support for the Afghan military and government, as well as growing economic co-operation, is vital to Afghanistan's long-term stability and to stop it becoming a launch pad for terror attacks. Mr Johnson said it was a ""crucial moment"" for the country and urged all sides to build on the ""considerable impetus"" behind a lasting political settlement. ""My visit comes comes just as the UK is considering the request from the US and Nato to give additional assistance,"" he said. ""I was hugely impressed by the work done by British troops as a part of this Nato mission. ""I believe there is still a lot the UK could contribute to this vital operation. ""The government will be taking a decision very soon."" The United States has about 15,000 servicemen and women in the country supporting the Afghan military. The Ministry of Defence has said it would keep its troop presence under constant review following a request from US President Donald Trump for other Nato members to make more of a contribution. Mr Johnson met a group of Afghan girls getting access to sports education through UK funding, part of the Â£750m in development expenditure earmarked between 2016 and 2020. He said the UK had helped pay for 300,000 Afghan girls to go to school and to train 10,000 teachers over the past six years. The Afghan foreign ministry said the talks had focused on peace and reconciliation efforts in Afghanistan and neighbouring Pakistan and the struggle against the Taliban and other insurgent groups. ""After the usual formalities, Deputy Foreign Minister Karzai appreciated the role and sacrifices of British forces for peace and stability in Afghanistan and thanked for the British co-operation in various political and economic spheres with Afghanistan,"" it said.

SNP 'may not back expansion',"The SNP has withdrawn its support for a third runway at Heathrow airport, hours before a key Commons vote on the move. But the UK government persuaded MPs to give the go-ahead for a third runway, which they say would boost the number of flights to and from Scotland. The Commons supported the government's plan by 415 votes to 119, a majority of 296. The Scottish government has been a longtime backer of the plans, and was still behind them on Sunday. For:415 Against:119 Did not vote:116  But SNP MPs abstained from voting because there were ""no guarantees of the benefits"". It has been projected that the expansion of Heathrow would create at least 100 extra landing slots from Heathrow to Scottish airports each week. Cabinet approves new Heathrow runway Grayling: Heathrow expansion will benefit Scottish airports Scottish government welcomes third runway plan The Scottish government had previously backed Heathrow's bid for a third runway, saying it would bring economic benefits for Scotland. On Sunday, a Transport Scotland spokesman said the government ""supports expansion at Heathrow airport"" and ""looks forward to Scotland seeing the benefits"". However, on the day of the vote, SNP MPs announced they would be abstaining because the UK government had ""failed to make the case"" for the move. Transport spokesman Alan Brown said SNP members ""could not vote for a third runway at Heathrow with no guarantees of the benefits"". Protestors campaigned against the third runway outside the SNP conference in Aberdeen The UK government faced opposition in its own ranks, with a number of Conservatives who represent seats in Heathrow's flight path rebelling. Last week junior trade minister Greg Hands resigned from the government to oppose expansion of Heathrow Airport. Mr Hands, who represents the Chelsea and Fulham constituency in London, said he had pledged to oppose the new runway at the 2017 election. The highest profile opponent of Heathrow expansion in the cabinet is Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, who once pledged to lie down in front of bulldozers to stop it happening. But he was visiting Afghanistan and unable to attend the vote in the House of Commons. Labour is also divided on the controversial issue, with members of the party's leadership, such as shadow chancellor John McDonnell, opposed to it, but high-profile trade union backers in favour. The party's MPs were allowed to vote however they wanted on the issue. Campaigners argue that a new runway will breach the UK's legal limits on air pollution and increase noise pollution with an extra 700 planes a day.

Prince William visits ancient city in JordanHe later flew to Tel Aviv for the first official royal visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories.UK,"This video can not be played The Duke of Cambridge met Syrian refugee children during a visit to Jerash The Duke of Cambridge has spent the day in Jordan - the first stop on his five-day visit to the Middle East. Prince William visited the ancient city of Jerash where he met young people helped by a charity refugee programme. His wife, Catherine, visited the ancient ruins during the 1980s when she lived in Jordan as a child. Later, the prince, 36, landed in Tel Aviv for the first official royal visit to Israel and the Palestinian territories. The duke and the Crown Prince Al-Hussein bin Abdullah II - whoon Sunday watched the England football match together,external- arrived at Jerash, the ruins of a Roman city dating from the first century. Jerash is a major tourist attraction in Jordan The Duchess of Cambridge was photographed there as a girl with her father, Michael Middleton, and sister, Pippa, during a visit in the 1980s. She moved to Jordan in 1984 when she was two years old, after her father, a British Airways manager, relocated to the capital of Amman. She spent nearly three years there and attended an English language nursery.

Wherever he could Prince William went out of his way to meet not just the country's leaders but the country's people - children, refugees from Syria, women who have worked together to make life better. Britain has strong ties with Jordan and their respective royal families have been friends for decades. Part of the plan was to strengthen those links. But this was also a opportunity for Prince William to learn, and to throw a spotlight  on causes he cares about. And, judging by the enthusiasm with which he was greeted and the smiles he left behind, he may have made a few fans in the process. Samia Khouri, director of museums at Jordan's Department of Antiquities, guided the two princes on a half-hour tour of the ancient site. She said: ""He was very surprised when he saw the photo, he did not expect that. But that's why he was here, because he wanted to take a photo at the same spot where Kate was photographed."" During the visit to Jerash, the prince met Syrian refugee children benefitting from Unicef's Makani programme, which offers psychological support for parents and children from deprived backgrounds, especially refugee communities. Prince William met a group of Syrian and Jordanian children at the archaeological site The duke had previously said he ""greatly admired"" Jordanians' resilience in the face of humanitarian challenges At a garden party in honour of the Queen's official birthday on Sunday, he told an audience of Jordanians: ""The way in which you opened your doors to hundreds of thousands of refugees from Syria, not to mention your longstanding commitments to Palestinian refugees, is remarkable."" He also visited a military base of the Quick Reaction Force - formed with British military support - to meet members of Jordan's armed forces. Prince William visited a charity supporting women with training and work opportunities Later, the duke visited the Dar Na'mah Centre, part of a charitable project set up by Jordan's Princess Taghrid to help orphaned girls establish their own livelihoods after they turn 18. After being shown the textiles, herbal oils and breads they make, Prince William was introduced to Lana Muslam, 29, who was abandoned as a baby and grew up in an orphanage. He told her: ""The story is very hard to hear, everything that you have been through. You are doing wonderful things here."" During Prince William's five-day tour of the region, he will meet both Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu and Palestinian Authority President Mahmoud Abbas. Kensington Palace said the ""historic nature"" of the tour was ""important"". The trip comes as Israel celebrates the 70th anniversary of its foundation, and amid a rise in tensions between Palestinians and Israelis. There has been an upsurge of violence across the Israel-Gaza border in recent weeks, with more than 100 Palestinians killed during protests and dozens of rockets fired into Israel from Gaza.

CO2 shortage: Coca-Cola pauses productionThe soft drinks giant says the shortage has temporarily stopped some output but supplies are fine.Business,"Coca-Cola says it has ""temporarily paused"" some production because of the shortage of CO2 gas. However, the soft drinks manufacturer says that so far the shortage has not affected supplies. Last week, the makers of Heineken's John Smith's Extra Smooth and Amstel said supplies had been hit. There are reports that the shortage is affecting deliveries of frozen foods, which are kept cool by dry ice, which is made by compressing CO2. The BBC understands Ocado is rationing the frozen food it delivers to avoid running out of dry ice. At least five CO2 producers in northern Europe are offline for maintenance,according to the publication Gasworld, which was the first to report on the shortage.,external Seasonal maintenance shutdowns have left the UK with only one big CO2 producer in action. In a statement, Coca-Cola said: ""We are currently responding to an industry-wide issue that is impacting the supply of CO2 in the UK. ""Our focus is on limiting the effect this may have on the availability of our products. During this time we temporarily paused some of our production lines for short periods, however there has been no disruption to supply to date and we are continuing to fulfil orders to our customers. ""We are working closely with our suppliers, partners and customers on a number of solutions as the situation develops. Carbon dioxide is used in guns for killing farm animals and providing the fizz in carbonated drinks. CO2 is also used in certain medical procedures. Last week, leaders of the UK's food and drinks industry warned the crisis was so serious it could harm production and asked the government to prepare to prioritise supplies. Carbon dioxide has a range of uses including packaging fresh food The Food and Drink Federation said it would affect much of the ""farm-to-fork supply chain"". The British Poultry Council (BPC) has warned that up to 60% of poultry processing plants could be knocked out ""within days"" as a result of the CO2 shortage. Government officials have held talks with food industry representatives over how to manage the CO2 shortage.

Iran fans try to disturb Portugal teamCristiano Ronaldo asked the Iran fans for quiet as they camped outside the his team's hotel.Europe,"Small groups of Iranian fans managed to keep up the noise throughout the night Iran supporters camped outside the Portugal football team's hotel in the Russian city of Saransk making loud noises ahead of their World Cup game. Dozens of fans turned up on Sunday night with vuvuzelas, bells and drums and to try to keep the team awake. Portugal star Cristiano Ronaldo was seen asking the fans for quiet, gesturing that he was trying to sleep. Iran need to beat Portugal in their Monday match to progress to the knockout rounds of the tournament. Video has appeared on Twitter of the noisy fans, and of Ronaldo asking them for peace.

Police were first called to the Hotel Mercure at around 23:00 local time, when a first group of Iranian fans arrived at the hotel and began to sing.

Hottest day of the year in the UK,"The UK has enjoyed - or endured - the hottest weather of the year so far, with temperatures of 30C in London. The country is officiallyexperiencing a heatwave, with more 30C days expected later in the week. Fears that railway tracks could buckle in the heat prompted Network Rail to introduce speed restrictions. Andthe Met Office has issued a yellow health warning,externalfor heatwave conditions between Tuesday morning and Thursday evening. The warning, in the west and north-east of England, means there is an 80% chance of temperatures which could be a risk to health, and is intended to help social and healthcare teams prepare. Ice creams, hot dogs and a weatherman in shorts Met Office forecaster Mark Foster said: ""High pressure is going to dominate this week so we can expect very high levels of pollen and UV."" On Monday the highest temperature of 30.1C was recorded at Hampton waterworks in west London. The year'sprevious record temperature had been 29.1C in Aprilat St James's Park in central London. In Scotland, the highest temperature of 26.7C was recorded in Balmoral, while the same temperature was also reached in Castlederg, Northern Ireland. Temperatures reached 28.7C in Usk, in south-east Wales. You must enable JavaScript to view this content.

Enter your location or postcode in the search box to see your result.   BBC Weather presenter Matt Taylor said: ""We're likely to get 30C on a couple of days this week, and it could still get hotter. ""If Scotland and Northern Ireland get above 29C, which they are likely to do by the end of Wednesday, it will be the hottest June day in both countries since 1995."" It's definitely beach weather in Hastings, East Sussex Elephants were sprayed with water to cool down at Chester Zoo St James's Park in central London also recorded 30C temperatures Network Rail said track temperatures could reach as much as 20C above the air temperature, meaning the steel rails can expand markedly. The reduced speeds are intended to lower the force exerted on the track, reducing the risk of buckling. One route affected by the speed limits is the line between London Waterloo and New Malden, in south-west London, where trains will be slowed after 11am each day until Friday. Andy Thomas, managing director of England and Wales at Network Rail, said: ""Our engineers and specialist extreme weather teams are monitoring track-side temperatures at vulnerable locations."" Green -minimum state of vigilance during the summer. Yellow - Alert and readiness- Social and healthcare services are on standby to reduce harm. Amber - Heatwave action- Care services target high-risk groups, like the elderly, with specific help. General advice is given to keep homes cool, drink plenty of fluids, and so on. Red - National emergency- Reached when a heatwave is so severe that illness and death may occur among the fit and healthy, not just among high-risk groups.

Harley to make some bikes outside US,"Harley-Davidson plans to shift some motorcycle production away from the US to avoid the ""substantial"" burden of European Union tariffs. Last week, the EU imposed retaliatory tariffs on US goods, including bourbon, orange juice and motorcycles. The measures are a response to new US duties on steel and aluminium imports. Wisconsin-based Harley-Davidson said the increased cost from the tariffs threaten its international sales, which it has been trying to expand. EU tariffs on US goods come into force Who is losing out from Trump's tariffs? The company has assembly plants in Australia, Brazil, India and Thailand as well as in the US. It said it would raise investment in its international plants, though it did not say which ones. ""To address the substantial cost of this tariff burden long-term, Harley-Davidson will be implementing a plan to shift production of motorcycles for EU destinations from the US to its international facilities to avoid the tariff burden,"" the company said. Harley-Davidson said it expected the ramp-up in production to take nine to 18 months. US President Donald Trump tweeted his disappointment at Harvey-Davidson's decision which he characterised as the company waving the white flag of defeat. Allow Twitter content?

The company's move is one of the most visible consequences of the trade disputes triggered by Mr Trump's decision to levy tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. Mr Trump says the duties are necessary to protect the US steel and aluminium industries, which are vital to national security. They have drawn retaliation from the EU, Canada, Mexico, India and others while driving up the cost of metals for manufacturers in the US. US companies that range from boat-builders to nail manufacturers have warned about the consequences of escalating trade tensions. However, the tariffs have also helped to spur investment in US steel plants. For example, British-owned GFG Alliance, has said it plans to invest $5bn over several years to reopen a shuttered steel plant in South Carolina. The firm says the move will put about 125 people back to work ""immediately"". Harley-Davidson said the EU's tariffs would add, on average, $2,200 (Â£1,660) to each bike exported to Europe from the US as the import tax increases from 6% to 31%. Harley, which sold nearly 40,000 motorcycles in Europe last year, said it planned to absorb those costs rather than pass them onto customers and risk hurting sales. Shares in the company sank almost 6% after the firm announced its decision, which is expected to add between $30m and $45m to its expenses this year. Harley-Davidson said the tariffs make shifting production ""the only sustainable option to make its motorcycles accessible to customers in the EU and maintain a viable business in Europe"". Harley-Davidson, which has been focused on expanding its overseas sales, said it remained committed to US manufacturing. This video can not be played How hogs and Harleys became weapons in a looming trade war. The company employed about 2,100 people at manufacturing plants in the US at the end of last year. It had already announced plans to close a plant in Kansas City, Missouri - a decision which workers claimed was due to the opening of a new facility in Thailand. Harley-Davidson has disputed those allegations, arguing the move was about boosting overseas sales. In early 2017, President Donald Trump met with executives from Harley-Davidson who he thanked for ""building things in America"". But just over a year later, Harley serves as a sobering example of what happens when Trump's America First trade policy collides with the rest of the world. While Harley-Davidson had been struggling financially well before the EU's retaliatory tariffs went into effect, the import duties of 25% certainly didn't help matters. Allow Twitter content?

It is worth mentioning that Harley could make the decision to shift production because it had chosen, in 2017, to open a new manufacturing plant in Thailand. At the time, the company said it was moving manufacturing there to avoid a different tariff: this one being the 60% duty levied on Thai imports. That decision, of course, was made after Trump decided to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade treaty that Harley had said it supported. All of which goes to show that when it comes to ""winning"" a trade war,  the only certainty is the unintended consequences that inevitably result when decades of trade policy are reversed in a matter of months. United Steelworkers, which represents some Harley employees and has supported some of the president's tariff announcements, said it does not know yet how the company's decision will affect US employment. Michael Bolton, a director at United Steelworkers, said: ""Harley's desire to improve sales both domestically and abroad predates the Trump administration's tariffs, as does the company's willingness to build assembly facilities overseas to avoid tariffs. ""The company built its reputation and image by making motorcycles here, and if the company wants to continue to market itself as an iconic American brand both at home and abroad, it needs to focus on US production,"" he added. Mr Trump had made raising manufacturing employment a goal, but economists warn that the escalating trade tensions are likely to be counter-productive. In addition to the metals tariffs, the Trump administration has also said it will impose tariffs on $34bn of Chinese goods starting on 6 July as punishment for violations of intellectual property protections. China is due to retaliate in kind. Mr Trump has also threatened tariffs on foreign cars and auto parts, arguing that firms should make such products in the US.

Eighty-two chihuahuas found at house,"The dogs were in cramped conditions, the RSPCA said Eighty-two chihuahuas were discovered at a house ""which looked like an earthquake had hit"" after police were called to investigate a death. The RSPCA were called to the property in Birmingham after police raised concerns about conditions. Some had matted coats and fleas, others had burns, an RSPCA inspector said. The dogs were found in April 2017 but the discovery is to be shown in an episode of  Channel 5's The Dog Rescuers. The couple who lived at the house had started out with two pets but did not get the dogs neutered and, after four years, they had 82 dogs, the RSPCA said. They said it was a classic case of hoarding, but the dogs had been loved. The dogs were taken to the charity's Newbrook Farm Hospital.

Police launched an investigation after the woman living at the property in the Washwood Heath area of the city died, but found there were no suspicious circumstances and that she had died from complications after an accident. Some dogs were hiding behind furniture and were in ""cramped"" conditions The RSPCA helped the woman's husband to renovate and clean the home while the charity cared for the dogs. Four dogs were given back to the husband and the rest were rehomed. The story features in The Dog Rescuers on Channel 5 at 19.00 BST on Wednesday.

Iran fans try to disturb Portugal team,"Small groups of Iranian fans managed to keep up the noise throughout the night Iran supporters camped outside the Portugal football team's hotel in the Russian city of Saransk making loud noises ahead of their World Cup game. Dozens of fans turned up on Sunday night with vuvuzelas, bells and drums and to try to keep the team awake. Portugal star Cristiano Ronaldo was seen asking the fans for quiet, gesturing that he was trying to sleep. Iran need to beat Portugal in their Monday match to progress to the knockout rounds of the tournament. Video has appeared on Twitter of the noisy fans, and of Ronaldo asking them for peace.

Police were first called to the Hotel Mercure at around 23:00 local time, when a first group of Iranian fans arrived at the hotel and began to sing.

Turkey 'entering era of one-man rule',"This video can not be played President Erdogan thanks voters for ""love"" Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan is taking on extensive new executive powers following his outright election victory in Sunday's poll. Parliament has been weakened and the post of prime minister abolished, as measures approved in a controversial referendum last year take effect. Defeated opposition candidate Muharrem Ince said Turkey was now entering a dangerous period of ""one-man rule"". Mr Erdogan polled nearly 53% in the most fiercely fought election in years. Mr Ince received just 31%, despite a lively campaign attracting huge crowds. Mr Erdogan, 64, has presided over a strong economy and built up a solid support base. But he has also polarised opinion, cracking down on opponents and putting some 160,000 people in jail. Erdogan's victory in 100 and 500 words How powerful will Erdogan be? ETurkey's pugnacious president Congratulations have come in from around the world, though some Western leaders have been slow to react. Russian President Vladimir Putin talked of Mr Erdogan's ""great political authority and mass support"". In his victory speech on Monday morning, Mr Erdogan vowed to bring in the new presidential system ""rapidly"". The constitutional changes wereendorsed in a tight referendum last year by 51% of voters. They include giving the president new powers to: directly appoint top officials, including ministers and vice-presidents intervene in the country's legal system impose a state of emergency Supporters of Erdogan and the AK Party took to Istanbul's streets to celebrate Some critics argue that Turkey's new system lacks checks and balances. Mr Erdogan says his increased authority will empower him to address Turkey's economic woes and defeat Kurdish rebels in the country's south-east. Turks abroad play decisive role in Erdogan vote Reality Check: The numbers behind Turkey's crackdown Losing their religion: The young Turks rejecting Islam Mr Erdogan was prime minister for 11 years before becoming president in 2014. Under the new constitution, he could stand for a third term when his second finishes in 2023, meaning he could potentially hold power until 2028. By Mark Lowen, BBC Turkey correspondent Despite 90% of the media being pro-government and largely shunning the opposition, the president's posters and flags dwarfing any challenge on the streets, the election being held under a state of emergency curtailing protests, and critical journalists and academics being jailed or forced into exile, Mr Erdogan only got half of the country behind him. ""We are living through a fascist regime,"" opposition MP Selin Sayek Boke told the BBC. ""But fascist regimes don't usually win elections with 53%, they win with 90%. So this shows that progressive values are still here and can rise up."" For now, though, this is Mr Erdogan's time. With his sweeping new powers, scrapping the post of prime minister and able to choose ministers and most senior judges, he becomes Turkey's most powerful leader since its founding father Ataturk. He'll now hope to lead the country at least until 2023, 100 years since Ataturk's creation. And a dejected opposition will have to pick itself up and wonder again if, and how, he can be beaten. Read more from Mark Mr Ince, from the Republican People's Party (CHP), said the election was unfair from its declaration to the announcement of the results. ""We have now fully adopted a regime of one-man rule,"" he told journalists after the vote. Mr Ince said he would continue his fight until Turkey was for everyone But he said he did not dispute the official results. The other four candidates on the ballot fell below 10% of the vote. Security was tight. Ahead of the vote, concerns had been raised about potential intimidation and electoral fraud. Turnout was high at almost 87%, the state broadcaster reported. Observers from the Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe (OSCE) said that although the election had offered a genuine choice, Mr Erdogan and his party had enjoyed an advantage. ""Regrettably, contestants did not have equal opportunities to compete and to campaign,"" the group said, echoing concerns of rights activists. It said the state of emergency in place since 2016 had caused limits ""to freedom of expression and assembly"" which affected other political parties. The OSCE was also critical of the unequal media coverage given to candidates, in a country which monitoring groups say has become the world's biggest jailer of journalists. In a statement, European Union officials echoed the OSCE's view that ""conditions for campaigning were not equal"". It also warned that the president's new powers had ""far-reaching implications for Turkish democracy"". Mr Erdogan's spokesman, Ibrahim Kalin, told the BBC his country's election system was ""very clear and transparent"". In separate parliamentary elections, the governing alliance led by Mr Erdogan's AK Party (AKP) secured a majority, with 53% and about 343 seats. The opposition CHP and its allies won only 33% (190 seats). However, the pro-Kurdish HDP re-entered parliament with 67 seats. Kurds in Diyarbakir celebrated the HDP's result The party's success comes despite the fact its presidential candidate Selahattin Demirtas is in a high-security prison on terror charges, which he denies. WATCH: Why the Kurdish vote was key The full story: Life under President Erdogan The biggest issue for voters was the economy. Inflation stands at about 11%, though the economy has grown substantially in recent years. The Turkish lira has suffered as Mr Erdogan has pressed the central bank not to raise interest rates and suggested before the poll that he might restrict its independence. Terrorism was another key issue, as Turkey faces attacks from Kurdish militants and the jihadists of the Islamic State group. Turkey's brain drain: Crackdown pushes intellectuals out Turkey has been under a state of emergency since a failed coup in July 2016, with 107,000 public servants and soldiers dismissed from their jobs. More than 50,000 people have been imprisoned pending trial since the uprising.

Murdered Britons' 'dream' Jamaica moveThe Manchester couple had retired to the Caribbean island after saving up all their lives.Manchester,"Gayle and Charlie Anderson were described as ""pillars of the community"" Two British grandparents suspected of being murdered in Jamaica had ""dreamed"" of moving there, neighbours have said. Charlie Anderson, 74, and his wife Gayle, 71, from Gorton, Manchester, were found dead after recently retiring to the Caribbean island. Their former neighbours said the couple had ""saved all their lives"" to afford a large house on the island, which Mr Anderson had built himself. Their granddaughter appealed for help to ""bring these people to justice"". This video can not be played Jamaica Police talk about their investigation into the murder of British couple The couple, who were also known as Halford and Florence and had been married for 55 years, lived in a rural community in Hope Bay, Portland, on the north-east of the island. They were found dead by neighbours in their home in Mount Pleasant on Friday afternoon. They had moved to the island a year ago with Mr Anderson, a builder, returning to his homeland. Mrs Anderson, a supermarket worker, and her husband sold their house and used savings to fund their new retirement life, friends have said. Charlie Anderson and his wife Gayle on their wedding day Speaking to the BBC, the couple's granddaughter Stacey Anderson, 30, appealed for help in finding their killers. She said: ""Please please speak to the authorities. I know that you might be scared but reach out to them and tell them everything that you know. ""We know that you must know details. It's a small community up there. Everybody knew my granddad and my grandma as well. They gave back to you. I know how much you all loved them so please please bring these people to justice."" John Carrigan, 54, who knew the couple for more than 20 years, said: ""Charles came over to Britain with just a satchel and made a life for himself by working hard. ""It was their dream to move back to Jamaica and own their own home there. They saved all their lives and sold their house here so they could retire there. It's terrible what's happened to them.""

UK's forgotten woman astronomer honouredThe Royal Observatory Greenwich is to start serious study of the sky again with a facility named after astronomer Annie Maunder.Science & Environment,"This video can not be played Annie Maunder was a pioneer of space photography but battled against discrimination The Royal Observatory Greenwich (ROG) is to start studying the sky again after a break of 60 years. British astronomy's historic home has installed new telescopes in its Grade II listed Altazimuth Pavilion, which has also undergone a restoration. The new facility is to be named after Annie Maunder, one of the first female scientists to work at the ROG and who made key discoveries about the Sun. Professionals, amateurs and school children will use the instruments. Today's technology, combined with new processing techniques, can achieve great results The new telescope is named after a forgotten giant of UK astronomy, Annie Maunder, who had to battle the prejudice and conventions of her time (the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th Century). The move should help highlight her contributions for a new generation. In addition, our cleaner air and better tech is making astronomy possible again in our cities. As urban centres have expanded, the artificial glow of buildings and street-lights - along with smog - has drowned out the faint objects in the night sky that astronomers want to study. So, in the last few decades, stargazing has moved out of town where you can get darker skies. But a combination of new technology and cleaner air means that astronomers will be able to use the Royal Observatory Greenwich again. Read more about Annie Maunder The new set-up will look at the Sun - just as Annie Maunder did in her day Charles II founded the Greenwich site in 1675. Its purpose was to map the stars and compile tables that could then be used for navigation at sea. It was a working observatory until 1957, after which serious science retreated to the countryside to get away from urban smog and light pollution. But with cleaner air and new technologies, it is now possible for telescopes to take very decent pictures again from the capital, says ROG astronomer Brendan Owens. ""We can use what are called narrow-band filters to get around the light pollution, and then there are the new processing techniques. We can take very fast frame-rate snapshots and use only the steadiest shots to build the final result. It's known as 'lucky dip imaging',"" he told BBC News. The Annie Maunder Astrographic Telescope (AMAT) is actually a four-in-one instrument. It comprises three smaller refractors around a top-end, 14-inch (35.5cm) aperture Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope. Users will be able to study the Sun and the planets in our Solar System, but also look beyond to more distant stars and planetary nebulae (great clouds of gas and dust). For the system to be used to look at the Sun is particularly apt in the context of Annie Maunder. The ROG plans to start slowly but over time will ramp up activities One of the ""forgotten giants"" of British astronomy, she got a job at Greenwich in 1891 working as a ""lady computer"", doing supporting calculations for male scientists. But she became an adept observer in her own right, and with her husband, Walter, broke new ground in our understanding of how the Sun goes through its cycles of activity. Given the times, all the credit went to Walter. That has changed in recent years with reappraisals finally - and properly - recognising her enormous contributions. ""She remained on staff here in Greenwich until 1895 when she had to resign because, as per civil service rules back then, she couldn't be married,"" explained Dr Louise Devoy, the Curator of ROG. ""But she remained very active, particularly with the British Astronomical Association, and indeed she came back to Greenwich in WW1 as a volunteer because of the shortage of staff when all the men joined up. ""The new telescope set-up will have a huge capability to image the Sun, with a special hydrogen alpha filter so you can really see activity such as flares (big outbursts)."" Annie Maunder pictured on an eclipse expedition in Labrador, Newfoundland The new installation comes thanks to a successful appeal for funds. ROG museum members, private donors and the public gave Â£150,000 towards the project. The money has finally enabled proper restoration work to be completed on the Altazimuth Pavilion, which was in urgent need of repair. ""It's a beautiful Victorian building that suffered major bomb damage. Half the building was obliterated during WWII,"" said Brendan Owens. ""It was reconstructed by the time the ROG became a museum, but it was never perfect and over time, brick work crumbled and damp had crept in. When we decided on the restoration, we could have included just museum space but we saw a wonderful opportunity to make it a multi-purpose, 21st-Century observatory."" Mr Owens said it would take a while to get the new facility running at top speed. Conversations are being held now with universities to see who would like to make use of Greenwich in their studies. As ever, the ROG wants the public involved as much as possible. Images taken by the AMAT will be streamed online, and content shared with schools through the Peter Harrison Planetarium. There will be workshops at the observatory as well. The ground floor of the pavilion will have an exhibition space, with a section dedicated to telling the story of Annie Maunder.

Murdered Britons' 'dream' Jamaica move,"Gayle and Charlie Anderson were described as ""pillars of the community"" Two British grandparents suspected of being murdered in Jamaica had ""dreamed"" of moving there, neighbours have said. Charlie Anderson, 74, and his wife Gayle, 71, from Gorton, Manchester, were found dead after recently retiring to the Caribbean island. Their former neighbours said the couple had ""saved all their lives"" to afford a large house on the island, which Mr Anderson had built himself. Their granddaughter appealed for help to ""bring these people to justice"". This video can not be played Jamaica Police talk about their investigation into the murder of British couple The couple, who were also known as Halford and Florence and had been married for 55 years, lived in a rural community in Hope Bay, Portland, on the north-east of the island. They were found dead by neighbours in their home in Mount Pleasant on Friday afternoon. They had moved to the island a year ago with Mr Anderson, a builder, returning to his homeland. Mrs Anderson, a supermarket worker, and her husband sold their house and used savings to fund their new retirement life, friends have said. Charlie Anderson and his wife Gayle on their wedding day Speaking to the BBC, the couple's granddaughter Stacey Anderson, 30, appealed for help in finding their killers. She said: ""Please please speak to the authorities. I know that you might be scared but reach out to them and tell them everything that you know. ""We know that you must know details. It's a small community up there. Everybody knew my granddad and my grandma as well. They gave back to you. I know how much you all loved them so please please bring these people to justice."" John Carrigan, 54, who knew the couple for more than 20 years, said: ""Charles came over to Britain with just a satchel and made a life for himself by working hard. ""It was their dream to move back to Jamaica and own their own home there. They saved all their lives and sold their house here so they could retire there. It's terrible what's happened to them.""

Gayle and Charlie Anderson's home in Jamaica Jamaican police said their house had been set on fire, and the couple suffered neck and face injuries during the ""heinous crime"". They also revealed their bodies had been partially burnt. Mr Anderson's body was found 130ft (40 metres) away from the house, while his wife's body was found outside the house. Police spokesperson Throyville Haughton said: ""Their house was partially burnt; however, one room was totally destroyed by fire. ""We observed... injuries to their neck and faces; however, we are not able to say at this time what caused these injuries."" The couple's deaths come as Jamaican authorities seek to tackle a crime wave which has resulted in more than 1,600 murders in 2017. So far this year more than 600 people have been killed. In a statement, the couple's sons said they were ""pillars of the community"". They said: ""They were hard-working people, building a business with integrity and making sure we were always provided for.

Minister quits to oppose plan,"Junior trade minister Greg Hands has resigned from the government to oppose expansion of Heathrow Airport. The vote on whether to build a third runway at the airport west of London is due to be held on Monday. Mr Hands, who represents the Chelsea and Fulham constituency in London, said he had pledged to oppose the new runway at the 2017 election. It had been thought that ministers with constituencies directly affected could have been allowed to miss the vote. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The highest profile opponent of Heathrow expansion in the cabinet is Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, who once pledged to lie down in front of bulldozers to stop it happening. But Mr Johnson is scheduled to be out of the UK on Monday so will not be attending the vote in the House of Commons. Labour's deputy leader Tom Watson suggested on Twitter that Mr Hands' resignation should prompt the prime minister to allow her MPs a free vote: ""It's not too late for her to change whipping arrangements. This would also allow Boris Johnson to re-enter the country."" Green Party co-leader Caroline Lucas said the foreign secretary should quit too: Allow Twitter content?

Prime Minister Theresa May defended the foreign secretary's absence from a vote seen by some as crucial to the UK's post-Brexit international trade campaign, known as Global Britain. She said: ""The government is absolutely committed to increasing airport capacity at Heathrow. This is important, it is part of our future as Global Britain, and the ambitions we have as a trading nation for the future. ""The foreign secretary early next week will be what I would describe as the living embodiment of Global Britain. ""He will be out there actually showing the UK's continued presence around the world, and the work that the UK continues to do around the world, with our diplomacy working on so many of the issues and challenges that we face across the world today."" Labour is also divided on the controversial issue, with members of the party's leadership, such as shadow chancellor John McDonnell, opposed to it, but high profile trade union backers in favour. The party's MPs are being allowed to vote however they want to on the issue. The SNP are in favour of Heathrow expansion, with the Lib Dems opposed and with the government deciding to whip (order) Conservative MPs to vote in favour, it is widely expected that the expansion plan will get Commons backing. A Downing Street spokesman said Mr Hands, who has held various ministerial roles and was chief secretary to the Treasury under David Cameron, had ""served the government with great ability and distinction over several years, and we thank him for all of his work"". Mr Hands will be replaced as a minister in the Department for International Trade by George Hollingbery, MP for Meon Valley. Meanwhile Mr Hands has tweeted that he cannot answer media calls about his resignation - because he is visiting a Romanian monastery: Allow Twitter content?

The debate on expanding Heathrow has been going on for nearly 20 years. The last Labour government backed the idea, and won a vote on it in 2009, but that plan was scrapped - and the idea of expansion put on hold for five years - by the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition formed after the 2010 election. But the idea of expansion was resurrected and has been subsequently backed by the Conservatives. Ministers approved a draft national airports policy statement in October but Parliament has  to give its approval for detailed planning to begin. Campaigners argue that a new runway will breach the UK's legal limits on air pollution and increase noise pollution with an extra 700 planes a day. It will result in huge disruption to residents of nearby villages, such as Longford, Harmondsworth and Sipson, with hundreds of homes likely to be knocked down. Robert Barnstone, from the No 3rd Runway Coalition, told the BBC the government was ""failing people and failing the environment as well"". Former Transport Secretary Justine Greening, who backs expanding Gatwick instead, suggested the idea of Heathrow as a national hub airport was outdated and the focus should be on improving regional capacity. And Tory MP Zac Goldsmith, who resigned his Richmond Park seat in 2016 over the issue and subsequently lost a by-election, said for many people ""this doesn't just look like a blank cheque being given by this government to a foreign-owned multinational, it looks like a whole book of cheques signed by our constituents"". This video can not be played Chair of Airports Commission, Sir Howard Davies told Today that Heathrow Airportâs expansion will succeed Heathrow's owners, which include Spanish infrastructure firm Ferrovial, say the airport is virtually full and a new runway would increase its capacity from 85.5 million to 130 million passengers. The expansion is estimated to create about 60,000 new jobs and generate about Â£70bn in total economic benefits by the 2050s. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling has said it will provide a ""vital legacy"" for the British economy. Residents whose houses are knocked down will get compensation worth 125% of their value - as well as legal fees and stamp duty costs paid for - while Â£700m would be available to fund noise insulation measures for those who decide to stay. Mr Grayling has said a ban on night flights was an ""absolute requirement"" and non-negotiable while he said landing charges paid by airlines must stay at current levels. ""This runway cannot be built if it does not meet air quality rules,"" he added. Sir Howard Davies, whose 2015 review recommended a new runway as long as environmental and community impacts were addressed, said ""significant"" concessions had been made on reducing early morning flights and minimising the impact on residents on the proposed flight path.

Roseanne regrets becoming 'hate magnet',"The comedian's show was cancelled as a result of her tweet US comedian Roseanne Barr says she regrets making herself a ""hate magnet"" after tweeting a racist comment which led to the cancellation of her TV show. In a tearful podcast interview with friend Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, she says she ""never would have wittingly called any black person... a monkey"". Last month, she compared ex-Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett, who is African American, to an ape. The interview was Barr's first since her revived show was cancelled. Roseanne's five most controversial moments Eight celebrity social media disasters Barr sparked an online backlash after she called Mrs Jarrett the child of the Islamist group the Muslim Brotherhood and the Planet of the Apes film. ""I said to God: 'I am willing to accept whatever consequences this brings because I know I've done wrong. I'm going to accept what the consequences are.' And I do, and I have,"" she said in the interview. She blamed sleeping pills for her tweet - an explanation some people do not accept. ""But they don't ever stop. They don't accept my apology, or explanation. And I've made myself a hate magnet. And as a Jew, it's just horrible. It's horrible."" She said of her tweet that she ""didn't mean what they think I meant"". ""But I have to face that it hurt people. When you hurt people, even unwillingly, there's no excuse. ""I don't want to run off and blather on with excuses. But I apologise to anyone who thought, or felt offended and who thought that I meant something that I, in fact, did not mean. It was my own ignorance, and there's no excuse for that ignorance."" Mrs Jarrett, centre, was one of Mr Obama's longest-serving aides Barr deleted the post and apologised, amid criticism of her and the ABC network, which airs her show. Mrs Jarrett was born in Iran to American parents. Barr's post came in response to another Twitter user, who accused Mrs Jarrett of helping to conceal spying during the Obama administration. ABC on Thursday announced it would air a 10-episode Conner family sitcom without Barr in the autumn. Barr said she agreed to the settlement to save the jobs of 200 cast and crew members.

Cabinet approves new runway,"This video can not be played Grayling on Heathrow: It is time for action Ministers have described their backing for a new runway at Heathrow Airport as a ""historic moment"" for the UK. The cabinet signed off the plans after they were approved by the government's economic sub-committee, which is chaired by Prime Minister Theresa May. Transport Secretary Chris Grayling announcedÂ£2.6bn in compensation for residents,externaland noise abatement measures. Environmental groups oppose the plan, which Mr Grayling says will only happen if air quality commitments are met. Heathrow runway to 'change lives forever' How do you build a runway over a motorway? The chequered history of UK airport expansion ""The time for action is now,"" Mr Grayling told MPs, who will be asked to vote on the expansion plan by 11 July. He insisted the decision was being taken in the national interest and would benefit the whole of the UK - with 15% of new landing slots at the airport ""facilitating"" regional connectivity. He said the Â£14bn runway, which could be completed by 2026, would be funded entirely privately - but MPs warned that taxpayers would end up footing the bill for billions in road improvements and other upgrades and warned that the UK's carbon emission targets would be threatened by the increase in traffic around the enlarged airport. A decision - finally? The debate on expanding Heathrow has been going on for nearly 20 years. The last Labour government backed the idea, and won a vote on it in 2009, but that plan was scrapped - and the idea of expansion put on hold for five years - by the Conservative-Lib Dem coalition formed after the 2010 election. But the idea of expansion was resurrected and has been subsequently backed by the Conservatives. Ministers approved a draft national airports policy statement in October but Parliament has yet to give its approval for detailed planning to begin. Opponents have threatened a legal challenge while Foreign Secretary Boris Johnson, who is MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip in west London, has vowed to ""lie down in front of bulldozers"" to prevent it. The BBC's assistant political editor Norman Smith said ministers whose constituencies would be directly affected might be given a ""get out of a jail card"" - by being allowed to miss the vote or even vote against. No 10 said Mrs May has written to ministers to say those with long-standing objections to a third runway will be permitted to restate their views at a local level, but not to campaign actively against the decision. In pictures: Heathrow airport Heathrow in my backyard Heathrow's death sentence for villages 'So expensive': Why are critics opposed? Campaigners argue that a new runway will breach the UK's legal limits on air pollution and increase noise pollution with an extra 700 planes a day. It will result in huge disruption to residents of nearby villages, such as Longford, Harmondsworth and Sipson, with hundreds of homes likely to be knocked down. Robert Barnstone, from the No 3rd Runway Coalition, told the BBC it was a ""disappointing"" day and the government was ""failing people and failing the environment as well"". Former Transport Secretary Justine Greening, who backs expanding Gatwick instead, suggested the idea of Heathrow as a national hub airport was outdated and the focus should be on improving regional capacity. ""We are now moving to point-to-point travel,"" she told BBC Radio 4's Today. ""Why should people who are living in Newcastle spend hours travelling down to London, then fly out somewhere else? ""There is nothing national about this national policy statement. It is just a runway in Heathrow."" And Tory MP Zac Goldsmith, who resigned his Richmond Park seat in 2016 over the issue and subsequently lost a by-election, said for many people ""this doesn't just look like a blank cheque being given by this government to a foreign-owned multinational, it looks like a whole book of cheques signed by our constituents"". 'Right for UK PLC' This video can not be played Chair of Airports Commission, Sir Howard Davies told Today that Heathrow Airportâs expansion will succeed Heathrow's owners, which include Spanish infrastructure firm Ferrovial, say the airport is virtually full and a new runway would increase its capacity from 85.5 million to 130 million passengers. The expansion is estimated to create about 60,000 new jobs and generate about Â£70bn in total economic benefits by the 2050s.

The political battle - by Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor Yes, the decades-long debate about airports in Britain is returning (it's never gone for long) just at a time when the government is embroiled in rows it will struggle to win. As one cabinet minister joked, ""it's the gift that keeps on giving"". However, with only Boris Johnson having big doubts around the cabinet table, the real rumpus will be in the Parliamentary Tory Party. Plenty of Tory MPs have long held objections to Heathrow and they will be made loudly on the backbenches in the weeks to come. The government doesn't have a majority and remember, it wants to get this plan through the Commons by the end of the month. If they can, it will be a demonstration of ""look, we are getting on with things, it's not just Brexit!"" There will be howls, and the process even after this likely vote is a very long one. But the government can expect to get the vote through. Even if Labour opposes it, which it may well do on environmental grounds, the party is also split on the merits of the project so might not all vote together. Read the rest of the blog Labour and the SNP save the day? This video can not be played Corbyn: Heathrow runway has to pass key tests Labour has said expanded capacity is vital to the UK economy but its support is conditional on tests being met on capacity, climate change, noise and air quality, as well as the wider economic benefits. But there is also a split in opinion when it comes to individual MPs, with shadow chancellor John McDonnell - whose Hayes and Harlington constituency could see homes demolished - says he is ""implacably opposed"". Shadow Transport Secretary Andy McDonald said his party would ""follow the evidence"" and not simply rely on assurances from Mr Grayling: ""If the correct balance is not found then the courts will rightly intervene,"" he said. Leader Jeremy Corbyn said: ""Yes, there is a demand for increased airport capacity across the south east, two of the south east airports are working somewhat under capacity, Stansted and Luton. Gatwick and Heathrow are working at pretty well max capacity, let's look at it in that context."" The SNP's Alan Brown said the new runway had the support of the Scottish government, most Scottish airports and Scottish firms who recognised the ""business benefits"". But Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable said the plans were an ""expensive folly"" and his party's 12 MPs would work with others to ""put an end to this project once and for all"". And The Green Party's MP Caroline Lucas said it was a ""disastrous decision"" which ""flew in the face of common sense and climate science"". The carbon question As one would expect, there have been contrasting reactions from business and environmental groups. The Institute of Directors said the end of arguments over Heathrow's future was within ""touching distance"". ""While the new runway is being built, we also need to make better use of capacity at existing airports in the South East, and indeed the rest of the country,"" said its director general Stephen Martin. But Friends of The Earth said a new runway was not compatible with building a low-carbon economy. ""Heathrow expansion would be bad news for our climate and will bring more noise, air pollution and misery to local residents,"" said the organisation's Jenny Bates.

Business and Energy Secretary Greg Clark said the Â£1.3bn project was not value for money, despite claims by developers Tidal Lagoon Power (TLP)a revised offer made it cheaper. The decision has beenslammed by local politiciansacross the parties, including the Conservatives. The scheme off Swansea Bay hadÂ£200m backing from the Welsh Government. But the UK government said it would not pay TLP the fee it wants for energy. TLP claimed no talks have taken place for more than a year and saidsupporters of the project have vowed to do what they can to make it a reality. How the tidal lagoon numbers crunched Lagoon decision 'crushing blow' for Wales Another 'kick in the teeth' for Swansea Q&A: Swansea Bay tidal lagoon Mr Clarktold the Commons,external: ""Securing our energy needs into the future has to be done seriously and, when much cheaper alternatives exist, no individual project, and no particular technology, can proceed at any price."" Government analysis estimated that the lagoon would cost the average British household consumer an additional Â£700 between 2031 and 2050. But TLP chief executive Mark Shorrock said the figures were wrong, adding that offshore wind projects had received Â£8bn in subsidies and the ""path finder"" tidal lagoon project needed Â£25m a year ""in order to kick start an industry"". ""It's a very, very sad day for Wales, for Swansea,"" he told BBC Radio Wales'Good Evening Walesprogramme. First Minister Carwyn Jonestweeted,externalthat it was a ""crushing blow to Wales"". This video can not be played Carolyn Harris: ""You will never understand the frustration and anger in my city"" Welsh Secretary Alun Cairns said: ""I realise the disappointment this decision may cause, but ultimately this project did not meet the threshold for taxpayer value."" There have been a number of calls among Labour MPs for Mr Cairns to go but he told theBBC Wales Todayprogramme he was proud of his record. Finance Secretary Mark Drakeford, speaking in an interview on Good Evening Wales, said: ""Wales has not had an effective voice at the cabinet table."" Plaid Cymru's energy spokesperson, Liz Saville Roberts MP, said the UK government's ""decision demonstrates the need for Wales to gain greater control over its own future"". Welsh Liberal Democrat leader Jane Dodds called the decision a ""disgrace"", as did Gower Labour MP Tonia Antoniazzi. The announcement brings an end to 18 months of waiting sincean independent review, commissioned by the ministers, recommended building the lagoon. TLP chairman Keith Clarke said: ""In light of today's statement and having heard next to nothing from government for two years, the board will be meeting in two days' time to consider its next steps."" This video can not be played Greg Clark said the lagoon did not meet ""value for money"" requirements The review by former energy minister Charles Hendry said Swansea should be used as a test of the technology, before allowing other developers to bid to construct further schemes as part of a competitive tendering process. The UK government has been accused of dragging its heels since then, during which time they repeatedly stated the scheme must prove ""value for money"". TLP claims the Swansea project would provide power to 155,000 properties in Wales and is cheaper than nuclear power. The developers had previously asked for a 90-year contract with the UK government with an average strike price - a guaranteed price for the electricity generated - of Â£89.90 per megawatt hour. The new nuclear power station at Hinkley Point C in Somerset was given a strike price of Â£92.50/MWh for 35 years. This video can not be played Watch Tidal Lagoon Power's video of how the turbines would work Analysis by Brian Meechan, BBC Wales business correspondent This was a project that seemed at one point to have widespread and almost universal support in Wales. It required the UK government to agree a significant strike price - a subsidy paid by consumers through energy bills - although the exact amount varied depending on the length of time that price was set for and whether other taxpayer funding was invested in the project. The independent report by Charles Hendry was very supportive of the tidal lagoon. However, it also said that doing a full, value for money, assessment was beyond its scope. In recent months, some in the business community have been privately raising concerns about the cost of the project and its impact on energy bills. While Tidal Lagoon Power and the Welsh Government now say it is the same price as nuclear power, the UK government insist it is double. However, the goalposts have moved. There was huge criticism of the UK government over the price for energy struck for the new nuclear plant across the water at Hinkley Point. With a pledge not to commit bill payers to such costs again, even getting the cost of the lagoon to a similar figure was unlikely to be good enough. It seems, ultimately, that UK ministers do not have confidence that the lagoon developers are able to deliver the project at the price they now think is reasonable for consumers to pay. Especially as other options such as wind energy come in at a much lower cost. 2003: Plans first emerge for a Â£30m tidal power project in Swansea Bay from a green energy charity 2006: Tidal Electric Ltd prepares a scoping report for a lagoon to take the project on but it is put on hold 2012: Tidal Lagoon Power (TLP) unveils its ambition to develop a breakwater and power generation 2013: TLP starts developing its plans 2014: Plans submitted to Planning Inspectorate with a cost of Â£850m 2015: Proposals get backing of UK government, subject to subsidy agreement - hope it could be operational by 2018 2016: Report warns of impact on fish. Charles Hendry is appointed to lead independent review into Â£1.3bn lagoon's viability 2017: Hendry review backs the lagoon as a ""no regrets"" option but the UK government is still to decide 2018: Delays, mostly believed to be over arguments over value for money. Welsh Government also offers substantial investment, as does Wales Pension Partnership Ian Price, director of business group CBI Wales, said: ""We appreciate the effort and energy made by politicians from both governments who have worked tirelessly to try and make this project a reality. At the end of the day, any project has to be affordable for consumers."" David Clubb, a director at RenewableUK Cymru, the trade body for all renewable energy, said: ""This means that the region will not benefit from many thousands of jobs from the project and the associated supply chain.""

Iran fans try to disturb Portugal teamCristiano Ronaldo asked the Iran fans for quiet as they camped outside the Portugal team's hotel.Europe,"Small groups of Iranian fans managed to keep up the noise throughout the night Iran supporters camped outside the Portugal football team's hotel in the Russian city of Saransk making loud noises ahead of their World Cup game. Dozens of fans turned up on Sunday night with vuvuzelas, bells and drums and to try to keep the team awake. Portugal star Cristiano Ronaldo was seen asking the fans for quiet, gesturing that he was trying to sleep. Iran need to beat Portugal in their Monday match to progress to the knockout rounds of the tournament. Video has appeared on Twitter of the noisy fans, and of Ronaldo asking them for peace.

Paper bags to replace plastic at Morrisons,"This video can not be played Theresa May has pledged to eradicate all avoidable plastic waste in the UK by 2042 Morrisons has started selling fresh produce in old-style paper bags, rather than plastic ones, as it tries to cut the use of plastics. The supermarket chain, the UK's fourth largest, says it will mean 150 million fewer plastic bags are used each year. Prime Minister Theresa May has called plastic waste ""one of the great environmental scourges of our time"". The UK has a target to ban ""avoidable"" waste by 2042 and all supermarkets are taking firm steps to cut plastics use. Interest in the issue was ignited by Sir David Attenborough's TV series Blue Planet II, whose shots of an ocean of floating plastic debris horrified many viewers. About 6.3 billion tonnes of plastic waste had been generated globally by 2015, with almost 80% of it going to landfills or the natural environment. All major supermarkets have introduced programmes and targetsto reduce, and in some cases eliminate, single-use plastics. In January this year, Iceland said it wouldeliminate or drastically reduce plastic packagingof all its own-label products by the end of 2023. The figures are disputed but it does appear that the production of paper bags uses more energy and creates more CO2 emissions than the manufacture of plastic bags. And there is no question that paper bags are bulkier and heavier than plastic bags and so take more energy to transport and more space in bins. But that's not the whole story. New forests grown to replace trees cut to make paper bags will help in the battle against climate change by locking up carbon from the atmosphere. Paper also decomposes quickly into natural products, while plastic breaks down into tiny particles that can get into the food chain and can potentially stay around for hundreds of years. Environmental groups say that what's needed in the longer term is a move away from single-use bags altogether. Marks & Spencer says that by 2022 all its product packaging in the UK that could end up with customers will be ""widely recyclable"" -  not just recyclable in theory, but in reality. It is replacing plastic cutlery with wooden alternatives and swapping plastic straws for paper ones. In April, leading supermarkets joined other major industry groupsby signing up to sustainability campaign group WRAP's Plastic Pact, whose goals include ensuring that, by 2025, 100% of plastic packaging is reusable, recyclable or compostable. Morrisons says its new paper bags are made from 100% recyclable paper. They will have a see-though paper strip - so that customers and Morrisons colleagues can identify the produce contained within. It is also encouraging customers to help in cutting down plastics waste by bringing their own containers to the butchers and fishmongers counters in return for extra loyalty points.

"Roseanne regrets becoming 'hate magnet'In a tearful interview, she says she ""never would have wittingly called any black person... a monkey"".US & Canada","The comedian's show was cancelled as a result of her tweet US comedian Roseanne Barr says she regrets making herself a ""hate magnet"" after tweeting a racist comment which led to the cancellation of her TV show. In a tearful podcast interview with friend Rabbi Shmuley Boteach, she says she ""never would have wittingly called any black person... a monkey"". Last month, she compared ex-Obama adviser Valerie Jarrett, who is African American, to an ape. The interview was Barr's first since her revived show was cancelled. Roseanne's five most controversial moments Eight celebrity social media disasters Barr sparked an online backlash after she called Mrs Jarrett the child of the Islamist group the Muslim Brotherhood and the Planet of the Apes film. ""I said to God: 'I am willing to accept whatever consequences this brings because I know I've done wrong. I'm going to accept what the consequences are.' And I do, and I have,"" she said in the interview. She blamed sleeping pills for her tweet - an explanation some people do not accept. ""But they don't ever stop. They don't accept my apology, or explanation. And I've made myself a hate magnet. And as a Jew, it's just horrible. It's horrible."" She said of her tweet that she ""didn't mean what they think I meant"". ""But I have to face that it hurt people. When you hurt people, even unwillingly, there's no excuse. ""I don't want to run off and blather on with excuses. But I apologise to anyone who thought, or felt offended and who thought that I meant something that I, in fact, did not mean. It was my own ignorance, and there's no excuse for that ignorance."" Mrs Jarrett, centre, was one of Mr Obama's longest-serving aides Barr deleted the post and apologised, amid criticism of her and the ABC network, which airs her show. Mrs Jarrett was born in Iran to American parents. Barr's post came in response to another Twitter user, who accused Mrs Jarrett of helping to conceal spying during the Obama administration. ABC on Thursday announced it would air a 10-episode Conner family sitcom without Barr in the autumn. Barr said she agreed to the settlement to save the jobs of 200 cast and crew members.

"MP campaigns for new ME treatmentPatients, carers and MPs say exercise therapy prescribed for chronic fatigue syndrome can be harmful to patients.","ME sufferer Ellie Bunce was diagnosed when she was a student Chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME, is incorrectly treated, lacks sufficient funding and is poorly understood by many in the medical profession - according to an MP who has been campaigning in Parliament to change attitudes. During an emotional Westminster Hall debate, Scottish National Party MP Carol Monaghan argued that graded exercise therapy (GET) - offered most commonly on the NHS - is often damaging and in need of serious revision. But researchers behind a trial of the therapy say it is a safe method of treatment. Guidelines on how the illness should be treated in England are currently being updated. In the debate, Ms Monaghan said: ""Characterised as 'yuppie flu', and misunderstood by doctors and politicians alike, we need properly-funded biomedical research into the causes and treatment of those with ME. ""Less than Â£1 is spent annually on each ME patient in the UK."" GET involves patients doing increasing amounts of exercise, over weeks and months, depending on their individual needs to aid their recovery. But MPs cited stories from constituents suffering with ME who say that GET has made their illness worse. Ellie Bunce, 21, was diagnosed with ME in 2016 and it has forced her to put her sporting ambitions on hold. ""At the time I was 19, a student athlete - in my second year of university - with hopes of rowing internationally. I was fit, active, I ate well, I exercised. Ellie Bunce once hoped to row internationally ""I was happy and positive and yet one day I woke feeling as if I was dying. My whole body ached in a way I'd never felt before."" Ellie says the first specialist she saw suggested her lifestyle was to blame. ""He said I should make more effort to wake up at 09:00, get showered, dressed and then go on a long walk. This was my 'treatment plan'. ""However, the more I pushed myself to get out of bed, the more ill I got."" After several months, Ellie was eventually diagnosed with ME. ""Day-to-day every inch of my body is in pain, I struggle to read and concentrate, I'm too tired to move. ""I spend upwards of 20 hours in bed a day.  I've been stripped of my hobbies, energy and work. ""I live in the hope that one day doctors will find a treatment and that one day I will be better."" The health watchdog, NICE, is currently updating its guidelines for treatment in England, but publication is not due until 2020. At the debate, Liberal Democrat MP Ed Davey called for GET to be suspended before the NICE guidelines are reviewed, raising the possibility that there could be future lawsuits from ME patients whose condition has worsened from the treatment. In 2012, the ME Association conducted a survey of almost 1,428 patients diagnosed with the condition. It found that of those who were prescribed GET, the symptoms of 12% improved, 14% were unaffected and 74% suffered worse symptoms. However, other health experts argue that GET is a proven and safe method of treatment. In 2011 a large-scale trial, known as the PACE trial, considered treatments including GET and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). Prof Michael Sharpe, one of the study's lead researchers, said: ""The trial found that GET can be moderately helpful in reducing fatigue and disability. We also found that it didn't cause harm. ""So the question is why is there a contradiction between the trials and what people are saying? Well it could be because diagnosis is a bit hit and miss, it could be that GET hasn't been done in a careful way. ""More research is needed to find out why there is such a difference."" Chronic fatigue trial results 'not robust', new study says ME and me how people cope with chronic fatigue Chronic fatigue syndrome treatment 'should be withdrawn' Chronic fatigue: I was 'held hostage by ME' A NICE spokesman said: ""We do recognise the controversy about the currently-recommended treatments and will discuss with the expert committee, once appointed, before deciding on any action prior to the completion of the new guideline."" There was an emotional outpouring of support on social media during the debate from sufferers, many of whom feel marginalised and forgotten, with no cure for their illness in sight. A tweet from Emma, who said the illness had robbed her of her 20s, was typical: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Extreme tiredness and other physical symptoms can make it hard to carry out everyday activities There is currently no cure for ME Source: NHS Choices,external Charities also welcomed the debate in Parliament and John Siddle of the ME Association said: ""We are extremely grateful to Carol Monaghan for securing the debate - but in truth, the hard work starts now. ""Many doctors still don't know how to diagnose and manage ME, and lack of research means that we still don't have any effective forms of treatment.

University student suicide rates revealed,"Suicide rates for higher education students have been revealed for the first time. TheOffice of National Statistics,externalfigures show 95 recorded university student suicides for the 12 months to July 2017 in England and Wales. This is lower than for the general population of similar ages, but does not include suicides among students at further education colleges. Since the 1950s there has been limited data on student suicides. A reportpublished last autumnshowed the numbers of students disclosing mental health problems had increased fivefold in a decade. Up until now detail on things like age clusters, people's undergraduate or postgraduate status, or comparison with similar-age people who did not enter higher education, has not been available. There were more than 2 million students studying at a university in England or Wales in the 12 months up to July 2017, meaning the suicide rate was 4.7 deaths per 100,000 students. Suicide rates were higher among young men than young women. Chris Coombs attempted to take his own life while struggling at university 10 years ago. He is now back at university studying to be a counsellor to help people who might find themselves in his situation. ""I became very isolated and started purposely isolating. Hygiene went out the window, personal care went out the window. That day-to-day routine thing didn't happen. I stopped going to lectures, I didn't answer emails, I didn't open post and cut myself off because it was too much to deal with."" This video can not be played Student Chris Coombs: ""By the end of March I knew that I was going to die."" Chris admitted it was hard to think about how to call on the resources available to help him resolve his situation. ""No-one knew I was ill, but personally that takes a great toll to keep up appearances."" Chris had counselling, opened up to friends and took part in activities, like singing with a choir, to confront his depression. ""When I compare how things were for me as a student over 10 years ago versus now that's a profound shift in how universities and other organisations view mental health. It is much more important. ""There are services out there that are not just bolt-ons but actually they are core value because, at the end of the day, it's in the interest of the university and the student that the student succeeds."" He says universities are getting better at providing the right support. ""More of our students are likely to come through without burning themselves out and without falling to pieces, and without feeling that they are stuck in a place they cant get out of."" Last month,Universities UK (UUK)announced it was working with NHS leaders to improve mental health support for students. Research by the Institute for Public Policy Research found that over the past five years, 94% of universities have experienced a sharp increase in the number of people trying to access support services, with some institutions noticing a threefold increase. UUK want university leaders to do more to provide support to students. John de Pury, the Universities UK lead on mental health policy, said: ""Although there is a lower rate of student suicide among university students in England and Wales compared with the general population of similar ages, there is no room for complacency here. This remains an urgent challenge for universities and society."" The University of Derby has been using a number of different techniques to help assist students who suffer from mental health problems. One of its methods includes all students taking a course in mental health wellbeing to provide ways to help them cope with the demands of their academic and personal lives. University of Derby vice-chancellor Kathryn Mitchell said: ""Our approach is we understand that students will arrive, probably with significantly higher levels of stress in undertaking their degrees, but our job is to make sure that whether some students are more stressed than others they can get the best outcome for their degree.""

Harley US plants lose out over Trump tariffs,"Harley-Davidson plans to shift some motorcycle production away from the US to avoid the ""substantial"" burden of European Union tariffs. Last week, the EU imposed retaliatory tariffs on US goods, including bourbon, orange juice and motorcycles. The measures are a response to new US duties on steel and aluminium imports. Wisconsin-based Harley-Davidson said the increased cost from the tariffs threaten its international sales, which it has been trying to expand. EU tariffs on US goods come into force Who is losing out from Trump's tariffs? The company has assembly plants in Australia, Brazil, India and Thailand as well as in the US. It said it would raise investment in its international plants, though it did not say which ones. ""To address the substantial cost of this tariff burden long-term, Harley-Davidson will be implementing a plan to shift production of motorcycles for EU destinations from the US to its international facilities to avoid the tariff burden,"" the company said. Harley-Davidson said it expected the ramp-up in production to take nine to 18 months. US President Donald Trump tweeted his disappointment at Harvey-Davidson's decision which he characterised as the company waving the white flag of defeat. Allow Twitter content?

The company's move is one of the most visible consequences of the trade disputes triggered by Mr Trump's decision to levy tariffs on steel and aluminium imports. Mr Trump says the duties are necessary to protect the US steel and aluminium industries, which are vital to national security. They have drawn retaliation from the EU, Canada, Mexico, India and others while driving up the cost of metals for manufacturers in the US. US companies that range from boat-builders to nail manufacturers have warned about the consequences of escalating trade tensions. However, the tariffs have also helped to spur investment in US steel plants. For example, British-owned GFG Alliance, has said it plans to invest $5bn over several years to reopen a shuttered steel plant in South Carolina. The firm says the move will put about 125 people back to work ""immediately"". Harley-Davidson said the EU's tariffs would add, on average, $2,200 (Â£1,660) to each bike exported to Europe from the US as the import tax increases from 6% to 31%. Harley, which sold nearly 40,000 motorcycles in Europe last year, said it planned to absorb those costs rather than pass them onto customers and risk hurting sales. Shares in the company sank almost 6% after the firm announced its decision, which is expected to add between $30m and $45m to its expenses this year. Harley-Davidson said the tariffs make shifting production ""the only sustainable option to make its motorcycles accessible to customers in the EU and maintain a viable business in Europe"". Harley-Davidson, which has been focused on expanding its overseas sales, said it remained committed to US manufacturing. This video can not be played How hogs and Harleys became weapons in a looming trade war. The company employed about 2,100 people at manufacturing plants in the US at the end of last year. It had already announced plans to close a plant in Kansas City, Missouri - a decision which workers claimed was due to the opening of a new facility in Thailand. Harley-Davidson has disputed those allegations, arguing the move was about boosting overseas sales. In early 2017, President Donald Trump met with executives from Harley-Davidson who he thanked for ""building things in America"". But just over a year later, Harley serves as a sobering example of what happens when Trump's America First trade policy collides with the rest of the world. While Harley-Davidson had been struggling financially well before the EU's retaliatory tariffs went into effect, the import duties of 25% certainly didn't help matters. Allow Twitter content?

It is worth mentioning that Harley could make the decision to shift production because it had chosen, in 2017, to open a new manufacturing plant in Thailand. At the time, the company said it was moving manufacturing there to avoid a different tariff: this one being the 60% duty levied on Thai imports. That decision, of course, was made after Trump decided to pull out of the Trans-Pacific Partnership, a trade treaty that Harley had said it supported. All of which goes to show that when it comes to ""winning"" a trade war,  the only certainty is the unintended consequences that inevitably result when decades of trade policy are reversed in a matter of months. United Steelworkers, which represents some Harley employees and has supported some of the president's tariff announcements, said it does not know yet how the company's decision will affect US employment. Michael Bolton, a director at United Steelworkers, said: ""Harley's desire to improve sales both domestically and abroad predates the Trump administration's tariffs, as does the company's willingness to build assembly facilities overseas to avoid tariffs. ""The company built its reputation and image by making motorcycles here, and if the company wants to continue to market itself as an iconic American brand both at home and abroad, it needs to focus on US production,"" he added. Mr Trump had made raising manufacturing employment a goal, but economists warn that the escalating trade tensions are likely to be counter-productive. In addition to the metals tariffs, the Trump administration has also said it will impose tariffs on $34bn of Chinese goods starting on 6 July as punishment for violations of intellectual property protections. China is due to retaliate in kind. Mr Trump has also threatened tariffs on foreign cars and auto parts, arguing that firms should make such products in the US.

Johnson defends missing Heathrow vote,"This video can not be played Greg Hands: 'I made an unequivocal pledge' on Heathrow Opposition MPs shouted ""Where's Boris?"" as a Tory MP who resigned from government over Heathrow expansion urged colleagues to join him in opposing a third runway. Ex-trade minister Greg Hands said it was a ""debate about being true to your word and to your election pledges"". Boris Johnson - who also opposes a third runway - has come under fire for travelling to Afghanistan and missing a vote to approve a new Â£14bn runway. MPs are expected to back expansion. Protesters against a third runway staged a protest in central lobby at the Houses of Parliament, a few metres from where MPs are debating the decision. About a dozen demonstrators from Vote No Heathrow lay down on the floor with their arms outstretched before being ejected from Parliament by police. Parliament Live: MPs debate runway plan Johnson Afghan talks focused on security Minister quits to oppose Heathrow plan Conservative MPs have been ordered to back a third runway, the SNP will abstain and Labour have been given a free vote, with up to 40 of them expected to back the government, meaning it will almost certainly become law. Mr Johnson has said following Mr Hands' example and quitting the government to vote against Heathrow would ""achieve absolutely nothing"". Mr Hands raised concerns over issues including flight paths and night flights and the impact on air quality, before telling the Commons: ""I think this proposal is fundamentally flawed."" To shouts of ""where's Boris?"" from some on the Labour benches, Mr Hands said: ""It's also a debate about being true to your word and to your election pledges."" This video can not be played John McDonnell makes an impassioned plea to halt Heathrow expansion In an impassioned speech, Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell warned that villages that had existed for 1,000 years will be ""wiped off the face of the earth"" to enable a company to maximise its profits. He told MPs to remember the name of Harmondsworth resident Armelle Thomas, whose late husband Tommy arrived in the UK during World War Two to ""fight for this country against fascism"" by flying planes for the RAF. Mr McDonnell said: ""His home that he built up with Armelle is in the centre of what will be the runway itself. ""There are human costs to this decision that this House needs to recognise and contemplate before they vote tonight to worry and blight my community once again on a programme that will never - pardon the pun - take off."" His speech was backed by Richmond Park Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith and Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, who represents Twickenham, both of whom raised concerns about the environment, the cost and alleged financial benefits of the scheme. Conservative former transport secretary Justine Greening said the story of Heathrow was one of ""broken promises, broken politics and broken economics"". Labour's shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald earlier outlined his party's official opposition to Heathrow expansion, criticising Transport Secretary Chris Grayling for making ""a complete shambles of a vital national project"". He said the government's case for expansion was ""riddled with gaps and fundamentally flawed"". SNP MP Alan Brown said the government had failed to give sufficient assurances that its Heathrow expansion plan would benefit Scotland's economy and ""connectivity"". A new runway, which was approved by ministers earlier this month, would increase Heathrow's annual capacity from 85.5 million passengers to 130 million. Opening debate in the House of Commons, Mr Grayling said Heathrow was ""full"" and a new runway was needed to secure ""a clear path to our future as a global nation in the post-Brexit world."" Heathrow runway to 'change lives forever' How do you build a runway over a motorway? Grounded: UK airport expansion plans In pictures: Heathrow airport As MPs prepare to debate Heathrow's future, Mr Johnson was holding talks with Afghan minister Hekmat Karzai Analysis by BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg The mystery of his whereabouts was solved, but not yet the mystery of the purpose. Afghanistan is not exactly an easy place to head for a quick hello. Several sources in Westminster tonight suggest there was a serious reason. My colleague Jonathan Bealereported last month,externalthat the government was considering sending about 400 more troops to Afghanistan to join the 600 or so already there helping train Afghan forces. Sources suggest tonight that the National Security Council will discuss the proposal tomorrow afternoon, with the government potentially approving the move, and a possible announcement in the coming days. The soldiers would not be involved in combat, but helping the Afghans provide more security in Kabul. Read Laura's full blog Last week, Downing Street said Mr Johnson, the ex-mayor of London, would be missing Monday's vote. His exact whereabouts, previously a matter of confusion, were revealed on Monday when the Afghan ministry of foreign affairs posted a picture on Twitter of its deputy foreign minister Hekmat Karzai meeting Mr Johnson in Kabul.

His absence has been mocked by other anti-runway campaigners in his party, including Justine Greening. When he was elected MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip in west London in 2015, Mr Johnson pledged to lie in front of bulldozers to stop expansion. Before leaving for Afghanistan earlier on Monday, he wrote to constituents saying the ""very considerable difficulties"" facing the third runway meant it would be ""a very long time before we have to make good on that pledge"".

But Mr Johnson, who has long promoted a scheme for a new airport in the Thames estuary, suggested it would be a futile gesture for him to resign over the issue. ""I have long been an opponent of a third runway at Heathrow and that is why I am not voting for it tonight,"" he wrote. ""It is clear from what is likely to be a large majority of MPs who are in favour of a third runway that my resignation would have achieved absolutely nothing."" The government has pledged the airport will be built at no cost to the taxpayer, will create 100,000 jobs and will benefit the entire country, through guaranteed internal flights to the rest of the UK. Ministers also insist the project will have built-in environmental protections, with the ability to fine Heathrow or ground aircraft if promises on night flights and other contentious issues are broken. An independent review in 2015 recommended a new runway at Heathrow as the best option to address the need for extra capacity in the south of England. The Department for Transport has previously said no expansion would mean London's five airports would be full by 2034.

Turkey's heart split in two,"For conservative, pious Turks, Mr Erdogan is their voice Ecstatic/distraught, relieved/incredulous: after yet another crushing Erdogan victory, Turkey's heart is again split in two. How did it come to this? His critics had hoped for so much. A fractured opposition had united for the parliamentary vote and looked set to deprive the president of his majority. And in the presidential election, the centre-left CHP believed they had fielded a winner: Muharrem Ince was charismatic, he had the common touch, he drew vast crowds. Polls suggested he would force Recep Tayyip Erdogan into a second-round run-off. Turkey's economic boom has stalled, with inflation at 12% and the Turkish lira losing almost a fifth of its value this year, prompting anger among Mr Erdogan's support base. Meral Aksener had looked set to eat into the president's votes A fiery nationalist, Meral Aksener, looked set to eat into the president's votes.  Mr Erdogan had stumbled in rallies. For the first time in 15 years, the opposition had dared to dream. But Turkey's serial election winner proved his doubters wrong on both counts. At Mr Erdogan's party headquarters, there was an eruption of joy: the burst of fireworks mixed with the boom of his campaign songs; flags bearing his face were held aloft. ""He means everything to us - this country would cease to exist without him,"" one supporter told the BBC. ""Terrorist organisations lost, the Turkish nation won,"" said another, his two-year-old wearing an Erdogan head banner. ""Real Muslims have won."" How powerful will Erdogan be? Erdogan: Turkey's pugnacious president Turks abroad play decisive role in Erdogan vote There were two surprises, which gave the president the victory he craved. The first was that the combined score of Muharrem Ince and Meral Aksener was not higher. Mr Ince's 30.7% was a significant increase since he burst on to the campaign in April, although it was thought he could go even higher - his final rallies drew millions. But Ms Aksener - nicknamed the ""she-wolf"" and once seen as the biggest threat to the president - polled lower than expected and than what was needed for a strong united front against Mr Erdogan. The second surprise was that in the parliamentary election, the president's far-right coalition partner, the MHP, far exceeded expectations. Its leader, who is 70 years old, lacking any popular touch and who held virtually no rallies of his own, somehow managed to win his party enough seats to keep Mr Erdogan's parliamentary majority intact. The claims of manipulation are loud. During the count, the opposition alleged that the state news agency, Anadolu, was calling results long before ballot boxes were opened. Millions of votes had not been counted, the CHP said, and yet the only source of figures was a news agency under the president's thumb. Other media which used to tally elections were closed down or sold off during the crackdown of the past two years. The government, and Anadolu, deny any falsehood. Mr Erdogan warned his opponents not to discredit the figures ""to cover up its failures"". Reality Check: The numbers behind Turkey's crackdown Losing their religion: The young Turks rejecting Islam Turkey's brain drain: Crackdown pushes intellectuals out The fact is that the Erdogan side of this country will simply not countenance defeat. For conservative, pious Turks, he is their voice - their very survival - in a country where many felt marginalised under past secular governments. For them, a shutdown of Twitter here, a jailing of journalists there is of no concern. It is the gleaming bridges, airports, schools and hospitals built under Mr Erdogan which have transformed their lives and which earn their unwavering loyalty. To his critics, his shouting matches with Western leaders are repugnant and take Turkey further than ever from its long-held dream of EU membership. To his supporters, the defender of their nation is standing up to imperialists who failed to destroy Turkey after World War One, but are still trying. The consolation for the president's opponents is that the pro-Kurdish HDP party - hit by mass arrests and persecution, its leader having run for the presidency from prison - managed to cross the 10% threshold to enter parliament and win more than 60 seats. It will keep its strong voice of equality and democracy. WATCH: Why the Kurdish vote was key The full story: Life under President Erdogan And the other consolation was that despite 90% of the media being pro-government and largely shunning the opposition, the president's posters and flags dwarfing any others on the streets, the election being held under a state of emergency, the curtailment of protests, and critical journalists and academics being jailed or forced into exile, Mr Erdogan only got half of the country behind him. ""We are living through a fascist regime,"" the opposition MP Selin Sayek Boke told the BBC. ""But fascist regimes don't usually win elections with 53%, they win with 90%. So this shows that progressive values are still here and can rise up."" For now, though, this is Mr Erdogan's time. With his sweeping new powers, the scrapping of the post of prime minister and the fact that he will be able to choose ministers and the most senior judges, he becomes Turkey's most powerful leader since its founding father Ataturk. He will now hope to lead the country at least until 2023, 100 years after Ataturk's creation. And a dejected opposition will have to pick itself up and wonder again if, and how, he can be beaten.

Erdogan's win in 100 and 500 words,"President Erdogan will now enjoy greater powers as president and have a majority in parliament Recep Tayyip Erdogan has won Turkey's presidential vote, cementing his authority with beefed-up powers. After 15 years at the top of Turkish politics, he fought off a spirited opposition campaign to secure the presidency in the first round and his party will also control parliament. The long read: Erdogan's Turkey Country profile Here is a rundown of what you need to know - in brief and at greater length. Read either or both to understand what his victory means. Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, 64, has not only retained the presidency until at least 2023, he has strengthened it. New powers approved in a 2017 referendum will now come into force, transforming what had been a ceremonial role into the key executive role in this Nato member country. He won 52.5% of the vote and avoided the risk of a run-off vote, shrugging off a faltering economy. For the first time, Turks voted for a new parliament on the same day - and handed the president's Islamist-rooted AK party a majority through its alliance with a nationalist ally. His main opponent has warned of Turkey becoming a ""one-man regime"". Recep Tayyip Erdogan has reshaped Turkey more than any other person since the founding of the modern state, first with two terms as prime minister and, since 2014, as president. He has presided over consecutive years of economic growth and improved public services. But he leads a polarised nation. The results of the 24 June elections show continued support for a leader who has cracked down on opponents and has the support of most Turkish media. One of his challengers for the presidency, Selahattin Demirtas of the pro-Kurdish HDP, fought his campaign from a jail cell and his closest rival, Muharrem Ince, says Turkey has become a ""one-man regime in its fullest sense"". Mr Erdogan has moved to consolidate his power since an attempted coupagainst his rule was suppressed in 2016. Turkey has been under a state of emergency ever since, with 107,000 public servants and soldiers dismissed from their jobs. More than 50,000 people have been imprisoned pending trial since July 2016. In April 2017,51% of Turkish voters endorsed a new constitutionthat scraps the role of prime minister and grants the president new powers: Directly appointment of top public officials, including ministers and vice-presidents The power to intervene in the country's legal system The power to impose a state of emergency Mr Erdogan called snap elections as Turkey's currency, the lira, has slumped 17% this year against the dollar and the main interest rate has been increased to 17.75%. While Turkey's economy continues to grow strongly - by 7.4% in the first quarter of 2018 - there are fears of a sharp slowdown ahead, and the fall of the lira has hit people's pockets. By winning 52.5% of the vote, he saw off his closest rival, Muharrem Ince, who won just over 30% of the vote. His AK party won 42.5% of the separate parliamentary vote but, together with the nationalist MHP, that gives him a comfortable majority with 343 seats in the 600-seat assembly. The nationalists' success came as a surprise to commentators and a bonus to Mr Erdogan, because the party's vote was widely expected to suffer after a rising star, Meral Aksener, left the party to form her own. A vast crowd attended a rally for opposition candidate Ince in Izmir on Thursday Mr Erdogan continues to win support in his conservative heartland outside the big cities and among expatriate voters in Germany, the Netherlands and France. Under the AKP, Turkey has embraced a moderate Islamism, accepting Islamic symbols in public life to some extent - for example, in allowing female state employees to wear headscarves. By contrast Muharrem Ince's Republican People's Party (CHP) is a staunchly secular party. He attracted mass rallies ahead of the elections in Izmir, Ankara and Istanbul, but while he polled well in the presidential vote, his party was unable to spread its appeal beyond Turkey's secular heartland. The CHP polled about 22%. Despite its leader being in jail and restrictions placed on voters in Kurdish areas of the south-east, the pro-Kurdish party, which is firmly against Mr Erdogan, won 11.6% of the national vote and will continue to play a significant role in parliament.

But Lingard was my man of the match. The runs he makes - he goes short, he goes long - he gets on the ball and dictates things. One of the biggest things I saw from Jesse is that Panama's number two, Murillo, was on him all game. He was pulling his shirt, pushing him in the back, stamping on his toes, getting in his ear and trying to get him to react. But he kept his cool, kept his discipline and stuck one in the top corner. It don't get much better than that! Jesse Lingard Text 81111 or tweet #bbcworldcup Chris Watt:I'd make a handful of changes for @England against Belgium. Rashford in for Sterling, maybe Dier for Henderson and also Butland for Pickford. Tell Jordan he's starting in round 2 but give another keeper game time in case of injury. Glennyboy:I still cant make my mind up whether we want to finish top or 2nd in the group. I guess the advantage of playing last means we can see how the draw pans out.

Mexican town's entire police force heldFederal forces arrest 27 officers and their boss after a mayoral candidate is murdered in MichoacÃÂ¡n.Latin America & Caribbean,"Mr Ãngeles was murdered outside his home on Thursday morning The entire police force of the Mexican town of Ocampo has been detained on suspicion of involvement in the murder of a mayoral candidate. Fernando Ãngeles JuÃ¡rez, 64, was shot dead by unknown gunmen on Thursday outside one of his properties. More than 100 politicians have been killed across Mexico ahead of general elections on 1 July. Mr Ãngeles was the third politician to be killed in the western state of MichoacÃ¡n in just over a week. The town's 27 police officers and the local public security secretary were detained by federal forces in the early hours of Sunday. Mr Ãngeles was a successful businessman with little previous political experience. He had considered standing as an independent but eventually joined one of Mexico's main parties, the centre-left Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). ""He couldn't stand seeing so much poverty, inequality and corruption and so he decided to run,"" one of his closest friends, Miguel MalagÃ³n, told El Universal newspaper. Mexico candidate thrives on promise of change A guide to Mexico's drug cartels Mexicans worry about election bots, trolls and fakes After his murder, prosecutors accused Ocampo's public security secretary, Oscar GonzÃ¡lez GarcÃ­a, of involvement. When Mexican federal agents arrived in the town on Saturday to detain him, they were stopped by local police officers. They returned with reinforcements on Sunday morning and arrested the entire force and their boss. They were handcuffed and taken for questioning in the state capital, Morelia. Prosecutors accuse the officers and Mr GonzÃ¡lez of links with organised crime groups in the state.

Erdogan tightens grip with Turkey poll win,"President Erdogan and his wife Emine greet supporters at his party's Ankara HQ Turkey's long-standing leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan has won a new five-year term after securing outright victory in the first round of a presidential poll. Mr Erdogan got nearly 53% with almost all votes counted. His closest rival Muharrem Ince was on 31%. He will now assume sweeping new powers, won in a controversial referendum last year. The post of PM will be abolished. Mr Ince accepted the result on the basis of poll figures - but said that everything about the vote was unfair. Erdogan's victory - in 100 and 500 words Turks abroad play decisive role in vote How powerful will Erdogan be? Turkey's political giant Final results will be announced on Friday. The polls were the most fiercely fought in many years. Mr Erdogan has presided over a strong economy and built up a solid support base by investing in healthcare, education and infrastructure. But the 64-year-old has also polarised opinion, cracking down on opponents and putting some 160,000 people in jail. Mr Erdogan gave a triumphant victory speech from the balcony of his party's headquarters in the capital Ankara at 03:00 (00:00 GMT), declaring: ""The winner of this election is each and every individual among my 81 million citizens."" Congratulations have come in from Islamic leaders including Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. Russian President Vladimir Putin talked of Mr Erdogan's ""great political authority and mass support"". Supporters of Erdogan and the AK Party took to Istanbul's streets to celebrate Mr Ince, from the Republican People's Party (CHP), said the election was unfair from its declaration to the announcement of the results. Turkey was entering a dangerous period of one-man rule, he added. The young Turks rejecting Islam Full story: Life under President Erdogan But he said that there was no significant difference between official results and his party's figures, and therefore he would accept the outcome. There were another four candidates on the presidential ballot, all of whom fell below 10% of the vote. President Erdogan will assume major new powers under Turkey's new constitution. The changes wereendorsed in a tight referendum last year by 51% of voters, and are due to come into force after the election. They include: Directly appointing top public officials, including ministers and vice-presidents The power to intervene in the country's legal system The power to impose a state of emergency Some critics argue the enhanced role will place too much power in one person's hands, and that Turkey's new system lacks the checks and balances of other executive presidencies like France or the US. Mr Erdogan maintains his increased authority will empower him to address Turkey's economic woes and defeat Kurdish rebels in the country's south-east. In his victory speech, he said Turkey would act more firmly against terrorist groups, and would continue to ""liberate Syrian lands"" so refugees could return to their homes there. Mr Erdogan was prime minister for 11 years before becoming president in 2014. Under the new constitution, he could stand for a third term when his second finishes in 2023, meaning he could potentially hold power until 2028. By Mark Lowen, BBC Turkey correspondent Despite 90% of the media being pro-government and largely shunning the opposition, the president's posters and flags dwarfing any challenge on the streets, the election being held under a state of emergency curtailing protests, and critical journalists and academics being jailed or forced into exile, Mr Erdogan only got half of the country behind him. ""We are living through a fascist regime"", the opposition MP Selin Sayek Boke told the BBC. ""But fascist regimes don't usually win elections with 53%, they win with 90%. So this shows that progressive values are still here and can rise up."" For now, though, this is Mr Erdogan's time. With his sweeping new powers, scrapping the post of prime minister and able to choose ministers and most senior judges, he becomes Turkey's most powerful leader since its founding father Ataturk. He'll now hope to lead the country at least until 2023, a hundred years since Ataturk's creation. And a dejected opposition will have to pick itself up and wonder again if, and how, he can be beaten. Read more from Mark Mr Erdogan said the governing alliance led by his AK Party (AKP) had secured a majority, in a separate vote for the 600-member chamber. State news agency Anadolu said the AKP itself had 42% of the votes for parliament with 99% counted, giving it a projected 293 seats. Its partner, the MHP, had 11% and 50 seats. The opposition CHP won only 23% (146 seats) despite Mr Ince's popularity in the presidential vote, while its nationalist ally the Iyi (Good) party won 10% (44 seats). In a development that will please Kurdish voters, the pro-Kurdish HDP exceeded the 10% threshold needed to enter parliament. With 67 seats, it will form the chamber's second-largest opposition faction. Kurds in Diyarbakir celebrated the HDP's result The party's success comes despite the fact its presidential candidate Selahattin Demirtas is in a high-security prison on terror charges, which he firmly denies. WATCH: Why the Kurdish vote was key Security was tight at polling stations. Ahead of the vote, concerns had been raised about potential voter intimidation and electoral fraud. Voter turnout was high at almost 87%, the state broadcaster reported. Muharrem Ince has accepted the results, though he believes the poll was unfair Rights activists have said the press is not free to report on all sides in Turkey. It has become the world's biggest jailer of journalists under Mr Erdogan's rule, according to monitoring groups. Mr Erdogan has already cautioned his rivals against claiming foul play, saying: ""I hope nobody will try to cast a shadow on the results and harm democracy in order to hide their own failure."" The biggest was the economy. The Turkish lira has tanked and inflation stands at about 11%, though the economy has grown substantially in recent years. The currency has suffered as Mr Erdogan has pressed the central bank not to raise interest rates and suggested before the poll that he might restrict its independence. Terrorism was another key issue, as Turkey faces attacks from Kurdish militants and the jihadists of the Islamic State group. Turkey's brain drain: Crackdown pushes intellectuals out Mr Erdogan's rivals accused him of damaging civil liberties in Turkey and spearheading a slide into authoritarian rule. Turkey has been under a state of emergency since a failed coup in July 2016, with 107,000 public servants and soldiers dismissed from their jobs. More than 50,000 people have been imprisoned pending trial since the uprising. Muharrem Ince attracted huge crowds on the campaign trail CHP candidate Mr Ince's fiery campaigning helped to revitalise Turkey's downtrodden opposition - but ultimately he lacked the numbers to end Mr Erdogan's dominance. BBC Turkey correspondent Mark Lowen tweeted: ""Yet again one half of #Turkey feels invincible, the other distraught."" Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Garden waste collection charges hit ÃÂ£74m,"More than half of councils now charge for green waste collection UK councils are charging almost Â£74m a year between them for garden waste collection, BBC research has suggested. Data collected by BBC One'sRip Off Britainrevealed that more than half of councils had introduced charges. Residents' green waste was previously paid for through the council tax bymost local authorities. The Local Government Association said councils were forced to charge because they face a Â£5bn shortfall in funding from central government. Rip Off Britain gathered responses under the Freedom of Information Act from 322 of the 326 UK local authorities responsible for waste collection. It found that 172 charged to pick up garden waste. The total charges for green waste collection have risen from Â£42.3m in 2014-15 to Â£56.9m in 2015-16, the data showed. And in 2016-17, the charges hit a total of Â£73.9m. Presenter Gloria Hunniford said: ""While clearly some of our viewers are unhappy their garden waste is no longer taken away for free, the results of our survey show it's unlikely that's going to change any time soon. ""And with further councils set to introduce such charges, even more of us will need to get used to paying to have our grass clippings taken away."" A spokesman for the Local Government Association said that local councils had been forced to introduce charges because ofcuts to funding by central government. ""Councils in England face an overall funding gap that will exceed Â£5bn by 2020,"" he said. ""Some councils were able to provide free garden waste services when they were first introduced but are now having to charge to reflect the growing cost of providing a collection service."" The charges for green waste collection represent an average cost to residents of Â£42.40 a year. But the programme found that prices vary hugely. Harlow in Essex had the highest average cost at Â£96 a year, followed by Arun in West Sussex at Â£86 a year. The lowest average costs were Â£18 a year in Monmouthshire and Â£22 a year in Richmond, North Yorkshire. The programme features residents of one particular street in Trafford, Greater Manchester, which is divided between two councils. One charges for garden waste, while the other does not. Resident Ian Billington said: ""When we first got a letter saying they were introducing it, I was shocked - because it was something that you have always had included in your council tax.""

MP campaigns for new ME treatment,"ME sufferer Ellie Bunce was diagnosed when she was a student Chronic fatigue syndrome, or ME, is incorrectly treated, lacks sufficient funding and is poorly understood by many in the medical profession - according to an MP who has been campaigning in Parliament to change attitudes. During an emotional Westminster Hall debate, Scottish National Party MP Carol Monaghan argued that graded exercise therapy (GET) - offered most commonly on the NHS - is often damaging and in need of serious revision. But researchers behind a trial of the therapy say it is a safe method of treatment. Guidelines on how the illness should be treated in England are currently being updated. In the debate, Ms Monaghan said: ""Characterised as 'yuppie flu', and misunderstood by doctors and politicians alike, we need properly-funded biomedical research into the causes and treatment of those with ME. ""Less than Â£1 is spent annually on each ME patient in the UK."" GET involves patients doing increasing amounts of exercise, over weeks and months, depending on their individual needs to aid their recovery. But MPs cited stories from constituents suffering with ME who say that GET has made their illness worse. Ellie Bunce, 21, was diagnosed with ME in 2016 and it has forced her to put her sporting ambitions on hold. ""At the time I was 19, a student athlete - in my second year of university - with hopes of rowing internationally. I was fit, active, I ate well, I exercised. Ellie Bunce once hoped to row internationally ""I was happy and positive and yet one day I woke feeling as if I was dying. My whole body ached in a way I'd never felt before."" Ellie says the first specialist she saw suggested her lifestyle was to blame. ""He said I should make more effort to wake up at 09:00, get showered, dressed and then go on a long walk. This was my 'treatment plan'. ""However, the more I pushed myself to get out of bed, the more ill I got."" After several months, Ellie was eventually diagnosed with ME. ""Day-to-day every inch of my body is in pain, I struggle to read and concentrate, I'm too tired to move. ""I spend upwards of 20 hours in bed a day.  I've been stripped of my hobbies, energy and work. ""I live in the hope that one day doctors will find a treatment and that one day I will be better."" The health watchdog, NICE, is currently updating its guidelines for treatment in England, but publication is not due until 2020. At the debate, Liberal Democrat MP Ed Davey called for GET to be suspended before the NICE guidelines are reviewed, raising the possibility that there could be future lawsuits from ME patients whose condition has worsened from the treatment. In 2012, the ME Association conducted a survey of almost 1,428 patients diagnosed with the condition. It found that of those who were prescribed GET, the symptoms of 12% improved, 14% were unaffected and 74% suffered worse symptoms. However, other health experts argue that GET is a proven and safe method of treatment. In 2011 a large-scale trial, known as the PACE trial, considered treatments including GET and Cognitive Behavioural Therapy (CBT). Prof Michael Sharpe, one of the study's lead researchers, said: ""The trial found that GET can be moderately helpful in reducing fatigue and disability. We also found that it didn't cause harm. ""So the question is why is there a contradiction between the trials and what people are saying? Well it could be because diagnosis is a bit hit and miss, it could be that GET hasn't been done in a careful way. ""More research is needed to find out why there is such a difference."" Chronic fatigue trial results 'not robust', new study says ME and me how people cope with chronic fatigue Chronic fatigue syndrome treatment 'should be withdrawn' Chronic fatigue: I was 'held hostage by ME' A NICE spokesman said: ""We do recognise the controversy about the currently-recommended treatments and will discuss with the expert committee, once appointed, before deciding on any action prior to the completion of the new guideline."" There was an emotional outpouring of support on social media during the debate from sufferers, many of whom feel marginalised and forgotten, with no cure for their illness in sight. A tweet from Emma, who said the illness had robbed her of her 20s, was typical: Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Extreme tiredness and other physical symptoms can make it hard to carry out everyday activities There is currently no cure for ME Source: NHS Choices,external Charities also welcomed the debate in Parliament and John Siddle of the ME Association said: ""We are extremely grateful to Carol Monaghan for securing the debate - but in truth, the hard work starts now. ""Many doctors still don't know how to diagnose and manage ME, and lack of research means that we still don't have any effective forms of treatment.

"MPs gear up for crunch Heathrow voteLabour could ""block"" new runway if it was in power, senior figure says ahead of Commons decision.UK PoliticsComments","This video can not be played Greg Hands: 'I made an unequivocal pledge' on Heathrow Opposition MPs shouted ""Where's Boris?"" as a Tory MP who resigned from government over Heathrow expansion urged colleagues to join him in opposing a third runway. Ex-trade minister Greg Hands said it was a ""debate about being true to your word and to your election pledges"". Boris Johnson - who also opposes a third runway - has come under fire for travelling to Afghanistan and missing a vote to approve a new Â£14bn runway. MPs are expected to back expansion. Protesters against a third runway staged a protest in central lobby at the Houses of Parliament, a few metres from where MPs are debating the decision. About a dozen demonstrators from Vote No Heathrow lay down on the floor with their arms outstretched before being ejected from Parliament by police. Parliament Live: MPs debate runway plan Johnson Afghan talks focused on security Minister quits to oppose Heathrow plan Conservative MPs have been ordered to back a third runway, the SNP will abstain and Labour have been given a free vote, with up to 40 of them expected to back the government, meaning it will almost certainly become law. Mr Johnson has said following Mr Hands' example and quitting the government to vote against Heathrow would ""achieve absolutely nothing"". Mr Hands raised concerns over issues including flight paths and night flights and the impact on air quality, before telling the Commons: ""I think this proposal is fundamentally flawed."" To shouts of ""where's Boris?"" from some on the Labour benches, Mr Hands said: ""It's also a debate about being true to your word and to your election pledges."" This video can not be played John McDonnell makes an impassioned plea to halt Heathrow expansion In an impassioned speech, Labour's shadow chancellor John McDonnell warned that villages that had existed for 1,000 years will be ""wiped off the face of the earth"" to enable a company to maximise its profits. He told MPs to remember the name of Harmondsworth resident Armelle Thomas, whose late husband Tommy arrived in the UK during World War Two to ""fight for this country against fascism"" by flying planes for the RAF. Mr McDonnell said: ""His home that he built up with Armelle is in the centre of what will be the runway itself. ""There are human costs to this decision that this House needs to recognise and contemplate before they vote tonight to worry and blight my community once again on a programme that will never - pardon the pun - take off."" His speech was backed by Richmond Park Conservative MP Zac Goldsmith and Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable, who represents Twickenham, both of whom raised concerns about the environment, the cost and alleged financial benefits of the scheme. Conservative former transport secretary Justine Greening said the story of Heathrow was one of ""broken promises, broken politics and broken economics"". Labour's shadow transport secretary Andy McDonald earlier outlined his party's official opposition to Heathrow expansion, criticising Transport Secretary Chris Grayling for making ""a complete shambles of a vital national project"". He said the government's case for expansion was ""riddled with gaps and fundamentally flawed"". SNP MP Alan Brown said the government had failed to give sufficient assurances that its Heathrow expansion plan would benefit Scotland's economy and ""connectivity"". A new runway, which was approved by ministers earlier this month, would increase Heathrow's annual capacity from 85.5 million passengers to 130 million. Opening debate in the House of Commons, Mr Grayling said Heathrow was ""full"" and a new runway was needed to secure ""a clear path to our future as a global nation in the post-Brexit world."" Heathrow runway to 'change lives forever' How do you build a runway over a motorway? Grounded: UK airport expansion plans In pictures: Heathrow airport As MPs prepare to debate Heathrow's future, Mr Johnson was holding talks with Afghan minister Hekmat Karzai Analysis by BBC Political Editor Laura Kuenssberg The mystery of his whereabouts was solved, but not yet the mystery of the purpose. Afghanistan is not exactly an easy place to head for a quick hello. Several sources in Westminster tonight suggest there was a serious reason. My colleague Jonathan Bealereported last month,externalthat the government was considering sending about 400 more troops to Afghanistan to join the 600 or so already there helping train Afghan forces. Sources suggest tonight that the National Security Council will discuss the proposal tomorrow afternoon, with the government potentially approving the move, and a possible announcement in the coming days. The soldiers would not be involved in combat, but helping the Afghans provide more security in Kabul. Read Laura's full blog Last week, Downing Street said Mr Johnson, the ex-mayor of London, would be missing Monday's vote. His exact whereabouts, previously a matter of confusion, were revealed on Monday when the Afghan ministry of foreign affairs posted a picture on Twitter of its deputy foreign minister Hekmat Karzai meeting Mr Johnson in Kabul.

His absence has been mocked by other anti-runway campaigners in his party, including Justine Greening. When he was elected MP for Uxbridge and South Ruislip in west London in 2015, Mr Johnson pledged to lie in front of bulldozers to stop expansion. Before leaving for Afghanistan earlier on Monday, he wrote to constituents saying the ""very considerable difficulties"" facing the third runway meant it would be ""a very long time before we have to make good on that pledge"".

But Mr Johnson, who has long promoted a scheme for a new airport in the Thames estuary, suggested it would be a futile gesture for him to resign over the issue. ""I have long been an opponent of a third runway at Heathrow and that is why I am not voting for it tonight,"" he wrote. ""It is clear from what is likely to be a large majority of MPs who are in favour of a third runway that my resignation would have achieved absolutely nothing."" The government has pledged the airport will be built at no cost to the taxpayer, will create 100,000 jobs and will benefit the entire country, through guaranteed internal flights to the rest of the UK. Ministers also insist the project will have built-in environmental protections, with the ability to fine Heathrow or ground aircraft if promises on night flights and other contentious issues are broken. An independent review in 2015 recommended a new runway at Heathrow as the best option to address the need for extra capacity in the south of England. The Department for Transport has previously said no expansion would mean London's five airports would be full by 2034.

'I trusted my daughter's abuser with my life'The mother of a girl groomed by her coach tells of the impact the abuse and his suicide had on their lives.Shropshire,"Julie's daughter was 14 years old when she was targeted by her martial arts coach Matthew Kendall, who went on to shoot himself when his abuse was uncovered. Julie* tells the BBC about the ordeal faced by Sarah*, who's now been awarded damages by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority. Sarah had a seminar with the Telford Thai Boxing Club group, which wasn't out of the ordinary for her to attend anything like that, and she was staying over in Bolton. I had a mobile number ring my phone about 12.30 on the Saturday night and it was Bolton police. I thought there must have been a fight, that's what I initially thought. The officer asked me where I thought Sarah was and did I know who she was with - I couldn't understand why she was asking me. Midlands Live: 'Aggressive' stag party forces plane to be diverted; Eighty two chihuahuas found in 'shock' discovery at 'cramped' home Matthew Kendall was found dead just days after his arrest over grooming allegations I said I know where she is and who she's with. She said 'would you be surprised if I told you she was staying in the same room as Matthew Kendall?'. I told her she couldn't be, I'd paid for her to have her own room. The officer said we needed to drive to Bolton, because Matthew Kendall has been arrested for child grooming. Initially I thought it had got to be some sort of mistake. Me and my husband got in the car and drove to Bolton. On the way my husband said to me 'Matthew isn't a paedophile'. I just looked at him and said 'what does a paedophile look like?'. We were so trusting, because this is a man that's working with social services and the police, so you've got no reason to doubt them. But after the arrest, it's almost like someone had flipped a switch in my head and it was like everything fell into place after that. There had been a change in Sarah's behaviour before we found out. She wouldn't sit in the living room with us, she wouldn't talk to us. She would literally walk in the house and go straight upstairs to the bedroom. The Long Mynd near Church Stretton, in Shropshire, where Matthew Kendall was found dead As it went on I kept asking her and she kept saying she was fine, but we could tell in herself she wasn't happy, but we just put it down to being a typical teenager. She's really funny - she's dry with it, and it had gone. She always had that fire in her belly and determination, but it had gone. There was nothing. I used to take her down to the gym and she would sit outside in the car. I would say 'are you going in?', she would say 'Mum, I hate him, he's disgusting'. I'd say 'don't go'. We never forced her to go, it was always something she wanted to do and then she would say she's got to. I never understood at the time, but once that came out all of it made perfect sense. It was only after he was arrested that I started to think back and how she'd be later and later being dropped off back home. I'd ask why they were so late and my daughter would just say they had to stay behind and pack things away, but it was later and later by the time she got home and I'd have to sit up waiting. Sarah's situation was discovered that night in Bolton when the woman from reception rang the NSPCC. She'd been asking Sarah questions at reception. The receptionist must have thought she's clearly a child. The night we went to Bolton to pick her up, when she came out she had refused to speak to the police. I told her there were monumental consequences to this if you've got anything to tell them. She went back in and spoke to them. She said that he had told her if she ever told anybody what he was doing she would end up with a criminal record. My daughter was caught naked in his room by the police. You can't get away from that. He was caught red-handed. She was scared. It wasn't that he had been arrested, it was the repercussions of what she had told them that she was scared of, and then in the space of 72 hours our lives just changed forever. Not only are we being told this man has been doing x, y, z to our daughter,he then shot himselfso she had the death of a 39-year-old man on her conscience. Since his death Sarah is trying to move on with her life, but still suffers anxiety and flashbacks. She has been awarded a payout, which she has said she wants to donate to charity. But it's not about the money, it's about acknowledgement [of her being a victim of crime]. It goes a long way; as a family he nearly broke us with what he had done. We would never have believed that this could happen to our daughter and we would never have imagined it of Matthew as we trusted him completely. I trusted him with my life. Matthew Kendall was never charged with any offences. However, in police interviews Sarah said Mr Kendall, from Wolverhampton, would hug her during training sessions, and when they were in his minibus together he would pull into lay-bys and get her to sit on his lap. Sarah told police he suggested she attend one-to-one training sessions and he would lock the door and put the shutters halfway down. She said he would kiss her and sometimes she would kiss him back. She also said he touched her intimately over clothing and guided her hand over his clothing. The Thai boxing club, which Mr Kendall owned, closed after his death. Following representation through legal specialists Hudgell Solicitors, Sarah was awarded damages by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA), a Ministry of Justice-funded scheme to support victims of crime. Michelle Nurse, a specialist in handling claims to the CICA at the firm, said: ""The CICA scheme delivers justice in cases such as this where somebody has been the victim of a crime even where there is no criminal conviction. By taking his own life, he of course prevented there being the natural course of justice in criminal courts over his alleged crimes. ""We feel it is significant that the CICA has reflected upon the evidence presented to the police and have awarded damages to our client.""

Mexican town's entire police force heldFederal forces arrest 27 officers and their boss after a mayoral candidate is murdered in MichoacÃ¡n.Latin America & Caribbean,"Mr Ãngeles was murdered outside his home on Thursday morning The entire police force of the Mexican town of Ocampo has been detained on suspicion of involvement in the murder of a mayoral candidate. Fernando Ãngeles JuÃ¡rez, 64, was shot dead by unknown gunmen on Thursday outside one of his properties. More than 100 politicians have been killed across Mexico ahead of general elections on 1 July. Mr Ãngeles was the third politician to be killed in the western state of MichoacÃ¡n in just over a week. The town's 27 police officers and the local public security secretary were detained by federal forces in the early hours of Sunday. Mr Ãngeles was a successful businessman with little previous political experience. He had considered standing as an independent but eventually joined one of Mexico's main parties, the centre-left Party of the Democratic Revolution (PRD). ""He couldn't stand seeing so much poverty, inequality and corruption and so he decided to run,"" one of his closest friends, Miguel MalagÃ³n, told El Universal newspaper. Mexico candidate thrives on promise of change A guide to Mexico's drug cartels Mexicans worry about election bots, trolls and fakes After his murder, prosecutors accused Ocampo's public security secretary, Oscar GonzÃ¡lez GarcÃ­a, of involvement. When Mexican federal agents arrived in the town on Saturday to detain him, they were stopped by local police officers. They returned with reinforcements on Sunday morning and arrested the entire force and their boss. They were handcuffed and taken for questioning in the state capital, Morelia. Prosecutors accuse the officers and Mr GonzÃ¡lez of links with organised crime groups in the state. Mexicans will go to the polls next Sunday to choose a new president, senators and members of the Chamber of Deputies. More than 3,000 posts at regional and local levels will also be at stake.

Major shake-up in the singles chartMusic played on YouTube will finally be included in the Top 40. Here's what that means.Entertainment & Arts,"Dua Lipa's New Rules was the most-watched video by British woman in 2017 Since YouTube launched, the streaming site has seen 20 music videos break the two billion views mark. Sitting at the top of the heap is Luis Fonsi's Despacito, which has been watched a staggering 5.2 billion times. But none of these views ever counted towards the song's position on the UK singles chart. That will change on Friday, when the Official Charts Company overhauls its rules to include music video streams and downloads for the first time. Unofficial videos and user-generated content featuring music will not count - but official videos played on YouTube, Apple, Tidal and Spotify in the UK will. Allow YouTube content?

""The way that music fans are consuming music is changing by the month,"" explains the charts' chief executive Martin Talbot. ""It seems anachronistic to be saying, 'we're only going to count the song', when it also has a video attached to it."" The move, which comes exactly four years after audio streams were incorporated into the chart, has been approved by record labels and BBC Radio 1, which broadcasts the chart every Friday. The first chart including video streams will be published on 6 July. The album chart will not be affected. Here's what you need to know about the change. Forty per cent of all music streaming in the UK takes place on YouTube - raising the prospect that stars like Beyonce and Taylor Swift, whose lavish videos rack up millions of views, could benefit most from the changes. Not so, says Martin Talbot. ""This isn't going to be a handbrake turn,"" he tells the BBC.  ""We're not going to suddenly see dozens of songs in the Top 20 that weren't there before."" In test charts, songs with viral videos only received a small upgrade to their chart position. ""The most obvious recent one was Childish Gambino's This Is America,"" says Talbot. ""Everyone was talking about it for days and days - and the week that all happened, it might have been three or four places higher. That was it."" Allow YouTube content?

""It's definitely about time,"" says Years & Years singer Olly Alexander, who's making a video for every song on the band's new album, Palo Santo. ""So many people now just watch the video - they're not even aware of the song separate from it. The fact they'll be considered now for the charts is a good thing."" Dua Lipa is another singer who knows the power of a good music video - after the colourful, upbeat clip for New Rules turbo-boosted her career last year. ""The response to New Rules was so crazy and I am so grateful for it,"" she says, welcoming the chart changes. ""Video was really important to me in my career. It's another way, as artists, that we can get our music to our fans."" Henry Scholfield, who directed New Rules, adds: ""I think its good for the stature of videos. They might become important again. ""What I'm hoping is that this will focus record labels on investing in videos, now that there's a tangibility to the result. If you suddenly have double the budget, you can do something extraordinary. And hopefully pay the crew decently."" In Spain, France and Italy, music played on free, ad-funded services like Spotify and YouTube don't count towards the chart. Although some in the UK were in favour of adopting that approach, the Charts Company decided against it. ""We thought that was too far,"" says Talbot. ""We recognise there are younger fans who maybe don't have access to credit cards, or low-income music fans who can't afford a subscription but will still listen on legitimate, ad-funded streaming services."" Spotify and YouTube both have a limited ""free"" service alongside their subscription platform A separate tweak to the chart formula will see paid-for music streams carrying more weight than ""free"" ones. Under the current system, every 150 streams of a song count as one ""sale"". From Friday, the ratio will drop to 100:1 for users on a premium subscription service; while the free rate shoots up to 600:1. The change will benefit artists who restrict access to their songs on the free versions of Spotify and YouTube - but Talbot promises it will promote new music, too. ""Premium subscribers tend to access new music quicker,"" he says. ""We found in our test charts that new music would enter maybe one place higher than before."" It's also worth noting you can't ""spam"" your favourite artist to number one. Once you've played a song 10 times in 24 hours, subsequent streams are not counted. The Charts Company first considered counting video streams back in 2014. But at the time, YouTube was the only place offering a full video service - and there were concerns over its royalty payments and, supposedly, the clarity of its data (specifically, how long a user needed to watch a video before it counted as one ""play""). ""I can't really go into the details of specific services,"" says Talbot. ""But any concerns we might previously have had, have been dealt with and sorted out.

Crackdown in numbers,"This video can not be played Who's been affected by Turkey's state of emergency? Almost two years after a failed military coup in Turkey, the country remains under a state of emergency. What has happened during the crackdown? Turkey is holding presidential and parliamentary elections on 24 June. There will be a second-round run-off for the presidency on 8 July if no candidate wins more than half the vote in the first round. The state of emergency does not prevent registered political parties from taking part in the elections, and all parties are holding rallies and running campaigns. But the government has used emergency powers to close down many independent media in the last two years, and most television coverage of the election focuses on President Recep Tayyip Erdogan's ruling Justice and Development Party (AKP). Turkey election: Four dead in pre-poll clash President faces tight vote Erdogan: The full story So why is the state of emergency in place and how many people has it affected? It was imposed in response toan attempted military coup in July 2016.The coup was a massive shock to Turkey. Parliament in Ankara was bombed by military aircraft, and more than 250 people were killed and 2,200 injured, many on the streets of Istanbul. Once it was clear that the coup had failed, a state of emergency was declared and the government began one of the largest recent purges of public employees anywhere in the world. The aim was to remove from office anyone suspected of having links with those who had tried to overthrow an elected government. The BBC asked a series of questions to the Turkish Ministry of Justice about the state of emergency and the number of people affected by it, but had received no response by the time this article was published. The figures used here come from a variety of sources: publicly available government information and data from non-governmental organisations. Since July 2016 more than 107,000 people have been removed from public sector jobs by emergency decree. Tens of thousands of others have been suspended, but most of them have subsequently been reinstated after investigation. There have also been a large number of dismissals in the private sector, but precise numbers are hard to come by. Many - but by no means all - of those dismissed are alleged to be supporters of the exiled Islamic cleric Fethullah Gulen, who lives in the United States and is a former ally of Mr Erdogan. Turkey accuses Mr Gulen and his followers of organising the coup, but he denies it. There is no question, though, that tens of thousands of his followers have found jobs in all parts of the state bureaucracy over a period of many years. Election rallies for President Recep Tayyip Erdogan are drawing large crowds Among those dismissed by decree since the coup attempt are soldiers and police officers, judges and prosecutors, doctors and teachers. Approximately a quarter of all judges and prosecutors have been removed from their posts. And a report on the state of emergency issued by the main opposition Republican People's Party (CHP) says at least 5,000 academics and more than 33,000 teachers have also lost their jobs. Aynur Barkin, a primary school teacher, is one of those who has lost her job. She insists that she has nothing to do with the Gulen movement. She's been taking part in small protests, organised by the Union of Education Workers, of people demanding their jobs back. ""I've been a teacher for 15 years,"" she says. ""My place is in my classroom. I should be able to go back to my school. I should be able to get my job back."" More than 250 people died in the 2016 coup Initially there was no way of appealing against dismissal by emergency decree. But under pressure from the Council of Europe, which monitors human rights, the government set up a commission to look at individual cases. More than 100,000 people have appealed to the commission, but it is an administrative process rather than a legal one. The government says it has reviewed 19,600 cases so far, and 1,010 people have been given permission to return to work. People who have been sacked by decree are given no information initially about what they are alleged to have done wrong. But some reasons are given subsequently, if an appeal to the commission is rejected. Critics say the evidence is often circumstantial: where you held a bank account, which app you used on your smartphone, or where your children went to school. (Among other things, Gulenist organisations operated banks and a well-established network of schools across the country.) But the only people who have precise details of the cases against them are those who have been arrested and charged with offences. More than 50,000 people have been imprisoned pending trial since July 2016. Imprisoned presidential candidate Selahattin Demirtas appears on photographs at rallies held by his supporters Again, many of them are alleged supporters of Mr Gulen. Others are leftists or Kurdish activists, also accused of supporting terrorism and imprisoned as part of a broader crackdown on dissent. Among them is the Kurdish politician Selahattin Demirtas, who is running for president from his prison cell. On Sunday night he made his only TV appearance of the campaign so far, filmed inside Edirne prison. But he often appears at election rallies as a cardboard cut-out. A large number of human rights activists, lawyers and journalists are also behind bars. The Turkey-basedPlatform for Independent Journalism runs a website,externalwhich lists more than 150 journalists and media workers who have been detained or imprisoned since July 2016 and are currently still in jail. On a visit to London, Mr Erdogan was keen to draw a distinction between ""journalists"" and ""terrorists"" Mr Erdogan was questioned about the jailing of journalists during a joint press conference in London last month with the UK Prime Minister Theresa May. His response was typically robust. ""You have to make a distinction between terrorists and journalists,"" he said. ""Are we supposed to call them journalists just because they carry credentials and ID cards?"" Lifting the state of emergency would not automatically free anyone from prison, nor would it invalidate emergency decrees that have the force of law. But it would remove a major cause of uncertainty in Turkey, where badly-needed foreign investment fell since the coup took place. In an election in which the state of the economy is the biggest issue, that matters. Opposition presidential candidates have always said that their first job after the election, if they win, will be to end the state of emergency. The president has previously insisted that the state of emergency will remain in place while there is a significant threat of ""terrorism"" from supporters of Mr Gulen or anyone else. But, in the last few days, Mr Erdogan has changed his tune, suggesting that he too will lift the state of emergency if re-elected - although he has also warned that it could be reimposed if necessary. Promises made during an election campaign are not always kept once the voting is over. But it seems that the president may be feeling the pressure.

Major shake-up in the singles chart,"Dua Lipa's New Rules was the most-watched video by British woman in 2017 Since YouTube launched, the streaming site has seen 20 music videos break the two billion views mark. Sitting at the top of the heap is Luis Fonsi's Despacito, which has been watched a staggering 5.2 billion times. But none of these views ever counted towards the song's position on the UK singles chart. That will change on Friday, when the Official Charts Company overhauls its rules to include music video streams and downloads for the first time. Unofficial videos and user-generated content featuring music will not count - but official videos played on YouTube, Apple, Tidal and Spotify in the UK will. Allow YouTube content?

""The way that music fans are consuming music is changing by the month,"" explains the charts' chief executive Martin Talbot. ""It seems anachronistic to be saying, 'we're only going to count the song', when it also has a video attached to it."" The move, which comes exactly four years after audio streams were incorporated into the chart, has been approved by record labels and BBC Radio 1, which broadcasts the chart every Friday. The first chart including video streams will be published on 6 July. The album chart will not be affected. Here's what you need to know about the change. Forty per cent of all music streaming in the UK takes place on YouTube - raising the prospect that stars like Beyonce and Taylor Swift, whose lavish videos rack up millions of views, could benefit most from the changes. Not so, says Martin Talbot. ""This isn't going to be a handbrake turn,"" he tells the BBC.  ""We're not going to suddenly see dozens of songs in the Top 20 that weren't there before."" In test charts, songs with viral videos only received a small upgrade to their chart position. ""The most obvious recent one was Childish Gambino's This Is America,"" says Talbot. ""Everyone was talking about it for days and days - and the week that all happened, it might have been three or four places higher. That was it."" Allow YouTube content?

""It's definitely about time,"" says Years & Years singer Olly Alexander, who's making a video for every song on the band's new album, Palo Santo. ""So many people now just watch the video - they're not even aware of the song separate from it. The fact they'll be considered now for the charts is a good thing."" Dua Lipa is another singer who knows the power of a good music video - after the colourful, upbeat clip for New Rules turbo-boosted her career last year. ""The response to New Rules was so crazy and I am so grateful for it,"" she says, welcoming the chart changes. ""Video was really important to me in my career. It's another way, as artists, that we can get our music to our fans."" Henry Scholfield, who directed New Rules, adds: ""I think its good for the stature of videos. They might become important again. ""What I'm hoping is that this will focus record labels on investing in videos, now that there's a tangibility to the result. If you suddenly have double the budget, you can do something extraordinary. And hopefully pay the crew decently."" In Spain, France and Italy, music played on free, ad-funded services like Spotify and YouTube don't count towards the chart. Although some in the UK were in favour of adopting that approach, the Charts Company decided against it. ""We thought that was too far,"" says Talbot. ""We recognise there are younger fans who maybe don't have access to credit cards, or low-income music fans who can't afford a subscription but will still listen on legitimate, ad-funded streaming services."" Spotify and YouTube both have a limited ""free"" service alongside their subscription platform A separate tweak to the chart formula will see paid-for music streams carrying more weight than ""free"" ones. Under the current system, every 150 streams of a song count as one ""sale"". From Friday, the ratio will drop to 100:1 for users on a premium subscription service; while the free rate shoots up to 600:1. The change will benefit artists who restrict access to their songs on the free versions of Spotify and YouTube - but Talbot promises it will promote new music, too. ""Premium subscribers tend to access new music quicker,"" he says. ""We found in our test charts that new music would enter maybe one place higher than before."" It's also worth noting you can't ""spam"" your favourite artist to number one. Once you've played a song 10 times in 24 hours, subsequent streams are not counted. The Charts Company first considered counting video streams back in 2014. But at the time, YouTube was the only place offering a full video service - and there were concerns over its royalty payments and, supposedly, the clarity of its data (specifically, how long a user needed to watch a video before it counted as one ""play""). ""I can't really go into the details of specific services,"" says Talbot. ""But any concerns we might previously have had, have been dealt with and sorted out.

'I trusted my daughter's abuser with my life',"Julie's daughter was 14 years old when she was targeted by her martial arts coach Matthew Kendall, who went on to shoot himself when his abuse was uncovered. Julie* tells the BBC about the ordeal faced by Sarah*, who's now been awarded damages by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority. Sarah had a seminar with the Telford Thai Boxing Club group, which wasn't out of the ordinary for her to attend anything like that, and she was staying over in Bolton. I had a mobile number ring my phone about 12.30 on the Saturday night and it was Bolton police. I thought there must have been a fight, that's what I initially thought. The officer asked me where I thought Sarah was and did I know who she was with - I couldn't understand why she was asking me. Midlands Live: 'Aggressive' stag party forces plane to be diverted; Eighty two chihuahuas found in 'shock' discovery at 'cramped' home Matthew Kendall was found dead just days after his arrest over grooming allegations I said I know where she is and who she's with. She said 'would you be surprised if I told you she was staying in the same room as Matthew Kendall?'. I told her she couldn't be, I'd paid for her to have her own room. The officer said we needed to drive to Bolton, because Matthew Kendall has been arrested for child grooming. Initially I thought it had got to be some sort of mistake. Me and my husband got in the car and drove to Bolton. On the way my husband said to me 'Matthew isn't a paedophile'. I just looked at him and said 'what does a paedophile look like?'. We were so trusting, because this is a man that's working with social services and the police, so you've got no reason to doubt them. But after the arrest, it's almost like someone had flipped a switch in my head and it was like everything fell into place after that. There had been a change in Sarah's behaviour before we found out. She wouldn't sit in the living room with us, she wouldn't talk to us. She would literally walk in the house and go straight upstairs to the bedroom. The Long Mynd near Church Stretton, in Shropshire, where Matthew Kendall was found dead As it went on I kept asking her and she kept saying she was fine, but we could tell in herself she wasn't happy, but we just put it down to being a typical teenager. She's really funny - she's dry with it, and it had gone. She always had that fire in her belly and determination, but it had gone. There was nothing. I used to take her down to the gym and she would sit outside in the car. I would say 'are you going in?', she would say 'Mum, I hate him, he's disgusting'. I'd say 'don't go'. We never forced her to go, it was always something she wanted to do and then she would say she's got to. I never understood at the time, but once that came out all of it made perfect sense. It was only after he was arrested that I started to think back and how she'd be later and later being dropped off back home. I'd ask why they were so late and my daughter would just say they had to stay behind and pack things away, but it was later and later by the time she got home and I'd have to sit up waiting. Sarah's situation was discovered that night in Bolton when the woman from reception rang the NSPCC. She'd been asking Sarah questions at reception. The receptionist must have thought she's clearly a child. The night we went to Bolton to pick her up, when she came out she had refused to speak to the police. I told her there were monumental consequences to this if you've got anything to tell them. She went back in and spoke to them. She said that he had told her if she ever told anybody what he was doing she would end up with a criminal record. My daughter was caught naked in his room by the police. You can't get away from that. He was caught red-handed. She was scared. It wasn't that he had been arrested, it was the repercussions of what she had told them that she was scared of, and then in the space of 72 hours our lives just changed forever. Not only are we being told this man has been doing x, y, z to our daughter,he then shot himselfso she had the death of a 39-year-old man on her conscience. Since his death Sarah is trying to move on with her life, but still suffers anxiety and flashbacks. She has been awarded a payout, which she has said she wants to donate to charity. But it's not about the money, it's about acknowledgement [of her being a victim of crime]. It goes a long way; as a family he nearly broke us with what he had done. We would never have believed that this could happen to our daughter and we would never have imagined it of Matthew as we trusted him completely. I trusted him with my life. Matthew Kendall was never charged with any offences. However, in police interviews Sarah said Mr Kendall, from Wolverhampton, would hug her during training sessions, and when they were in his minibus together he would pull into lay-bys and get her to sit on his lap. Sarah told police he suggested she attend one-to-one training sessions and he would lock the door and put the shutters halfway down. She said he would kiss her and sometimes she would kiss him back. She also said he touched her intimately over clothing and guided her hand over his clothing. The Thai boxing club, which Mr Kendall owned, closed after his death. Following representation through legal specialists Hudgell Solicitors, Sarah was awarded damages by the Criminal Injuries Compensation Authority (CICA), a Ministry of Justice-funded scheme to support victims of crime. Michelle Nurse, a specialist in handling claims to the CICA at the firm, said: ""The CICA scheme delivers justice in cases such as this where somebody has been the victim of a crime even where there is no criminal conviction. By taking his own life, he of course prevented there being the natural course of justice in criminal courts over his alleged crimes. ""We feel it is significant that the CICA has reflected upon the evidence presented to the police and have awarded damages to our client."" If you're worried a child is at risk, you can contact the children's social care team at his or her local council. You can choose not to give your details. You can alsoreport any suspicions online,externalto the Child Exploitation and Online Protection command (CEOP), or call the NSPCC 24-hour helpline on 0808 800 5000 for expert advice and support.

England 6-1 Panama Jermaine JenasFormer England midfielder on BBC Radio 5 live I think down that right-hand side especially, with Kieran Trippier and Ruben Loftus-Cheek, we're finding a way to create some real chances, and we've got the best number nine in the tournament at the minute, he doesn't seem to be able to miss. But Lingard was my man of the match. The runs he makes - he goes short, he goes long - he gets on the ball and dictates things. One of the biggest things I saw from Jesse is that Panama's number two, Murillo, was on him all game. He was pulling his shirt, pushing him in the back, stamping on his toes, getting in his ear and trying to get him to react. But he kept his cool, kept his discipline and stuck one in the top corner. It don't get much better than that! Jesse Lingard Text 81111 or tweet #bbcworldcup Chris Watt:I'd make a handful of changes for @England against Belgium.

One dead and two injured in burglary,"The attack happened in Prewett Street, Redcliffe, in the early hours A man has died and two other men have suffered life-changing injuries during a burglary in Bristol. The attack happened in Prewett Street, Redcliffe, just after 01:00 BST and the two injured men are currently being treated in hospital. Two men, aged 25 and 37, have been arrested on suspicion of murder and are currently in police custody. One line of inquiry police are pursuing is whether the incident was linked to drugs. Reverend Kat Campion-Spall of nearby St Mary's Redcliffe Church admits drug-dealing in the area is ""an issue"". Avon and Somerset Police said all the men involved in the incident are from the London area. At the scene:BBC Points West reporter Scott Ellis A very large area around a set of council flats has been cordoned off and a huge amount of police cordon tape been has been put up. At a bus stop you can see a number of forensic officers inspecting something that looks like a sleeping bag along with clothing. On Prewett Street itself, there is a black Mercedes hatchback car parked in the middle of the street with its position chalked in, so that also appears to be of interest. Senior Investigating Officer Andrew Mott said: ""We deployed a significant number of resources to this incident and as a result we've apprehended two men who ran away from the scene when we arrived. ""Early indications are that this appears to be an isolated incident but I'd urge anyone with concerns to speak to one of the neighbourhood officers."" Detectives say a cordon is likely to remain in place for ""some time"" to allow crime scene investigators to examine the area.

Stars come out for London once more,"This video can not be played Annie Maunder was a pioneer of space photography but battled against discrimination The Royal Observatory Greenwich (ROG) is to start studying the sky again after a break of 60 years. British astronomy's historic home has installed new telescopes in its Grade II listed Altazimuth Pavilion, which has also undergone a restoration. The new facility is to be named after Annie Maunder, one of the first female scientists to work at the ROG and who made key discoveries about the Sun. Professionals, amateurs and school children will use the instruments. Today's technology, combined with new processing techniques, can achieve great results The new telescope is named after a forgotten giant of UK astronomy, Annie Maunder, who had to battle the prejudice and conventions of her time (the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th Century). The move should help highlight her contributions for a new generation. In addition, our cleaner air and better tech is making astronomy possible again in our cities. As urban centres have expanded, the artificial glow of buildings and street-lights - along with smog - has drowned out the faint objects in the night sky that astronomers want to study. So, in the last few decades, stargazing has moved out of town where you can get darker skies. But a combination of new technology and cleaner air means that astronomers will be able to use the Royal Observatory Greenwich again. Read more about Annie Maunder The new set-up will look at the Sun - just as Annie Maunder did in her day Charles II founded the Greenwich site in 1675. Its purpose was to map the stars and compile tables that could then be used for navigation at sea. It was a working observatory until 1957, after which serious science retreated to the countryside to get away from urban smog and light pollution. But with cleaner air and new technologies, it is now possible for telescopes to take very decent pictures again from the capital, says ROG astronomer Brendan Owens. ""We can use what are called narrow-band filters to get around the light pollution, and then there are the new processing techniques. We can take very fast frame-rate snapshots and use only the steadiest shots to build the final result. It's known as 'lucky dip imaging',"" he told BBC News. The Annie Maunder Astrographic Telescope (AMAT) is actually a four-in-one instrument. It comprises three smaller refractors around a top-end, 14-inch (35.5cm) aperture Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope. Users will be able to study the Sun and the planets in our Solar System, but also look beyond to more distant stars and planetary nebulae (great clouds of gas and dust).

Stars come out for London once moreThe Royal Observatory Greenwich is to start serious study of the sky again after a break of 60 years.,"This video can not be played Annie Maunder was a pioneer of space photography but battled against discrimination The Royal Observatory Greenwich (ROG) is to start studying the sky again after a break of 60 years. British astronomy's historic home has installed new telescopes in its Grade II listed Altazimuth Pavilion, which has also undergone a restoration. The new facility is to be named after Annie Maunder, one of the first female scientists to work at the ROG and who made key discoveries about the Sun. Professionals, amateurs and school children will use the instruments. Today's technology, combined with new processing techniques, can achieve great results The new telescope is named after a forgotten giant of UK astronomy, Annie Maunder, who had to battle the prejudice and conventions of her time (the end of the 19th and beginning of the 20th Century). The move should help highlight her contributions for a new generation. In addition, our cleaner air and better tech is making astronomy possible again in our cities. As urban centres have expanded, the artificial glow of buildings and street-lights - along with smog - has drowned out the faint objects in the night sky that astronomers want to study. So, in the last few decades, stargazing has moved out of town where you can get darker skies. But a combination of new technology and cleaner air means that astronomers will be able to use the Royal Observatory Greenwich again. Read more about Annie Maunder The new set-up will look at the Sun - just as Annie Maunder did in her day Charles II founded the Greenwich site in 1675. Its purpose was to map the stars and compile tables that could then be used for navigation at sea. It was a working observatory until 1957, after which serious science retreated to the countryside to get away from urban smog and light pollution. But with cleaner air and new technologies, it is now possible for telescopes to take very decent pictures again from the capital, says ROG astronomer Brendan Owens. ""We can use what are called narrow-band filters to get around the light pollution, and then there are the new processing techniques. We can take very fast frame-rate snapshots and use only the steadiest shots to build the final result. It's known as 'lucky dip imaging',"" he told BBC News. The Annie Maunder Astrographic Telescope (AMAT) is actually a four-in-one instrument. It comprises three smaller refractors around a top-end, 14-inch (35.5cm) aperture Schmidt-Cassegrain telescope. Users will be able to study the Sun and the planets in our Solar System, but also look beyond to more distant stars and planetary nebulae (great clouds of gas and dust). For the system to be used to look at the Sun is particularly apt in the context of Annie Maunder.

But Lingard was my man of the match. The runs he makes - he goes short, he goes long - he gets on the ball and dictates things. One of the biggest things I saw from Jesse is that Panama's number two, Murillo, was on him all game. He was pulling his shirt, pushing him in the back, stamping on his toes, getting in his ear and trying to get him to react. But he kept his cool, kept his discipline and stuck one in the top corner.

Elections in 100 & 500 words,"President Erdogan will now enjoy greater powers as president and have a majority in parliament Recep Tayyip Erdogan has won Turkey's presidential vote, cementing his authority with beefed-up powers. After 15 years at the top of Turkish politics, he fought off a spirited opposition campaign to secure the presidency in the first round and his party will also control parliament. The long read: Erdogan's Turkey Country profile Here is a rundown of what you need to know - in brief and at greater length. Read either or both to understand what his victory means. Turkey's Recep Tayyip Erdogan, 64, has not only retained the presidency until at least 2023, he has strengthened it. New powers approved in a 2017 referendum will now come into force, transforming what had been a ceremonial role into the key executive role in this Nato member country. He won 52.5% of the vote and avoided the risk of a run-off vote, shrugging off a faltering economy. For the first time, Turks voted for a new parliament on the same day - and handed the president's Islamist-rooted AK party a majority through its alliance with a nationalist ally. His main opponent has warned of Turkey becoming a ""one-man regime"". Recep Tayyip Erdogan has reshaped Turkey more than any other person since the founding of the modern state, first with two terms as prime minister and, since 2014, as president. He has presided over consecutive years of economic growth and improved public services. But he leads a polarised nation. The results of the 24 June elections show continued support for a leader who has cracked down on opponents and has the support of most Turkish media. One of his challengers for the presidency, Selahattin Demirtas of the pro-Kurdish HDP, fought his campaign from a jail cell and his closest rival, Muharrem Ince, says Turkey has become a ""one-man regime in its fullest sense"". Mr Erdogan has moved to consolidate his power since an attempted coupagainst his rule was suppressed in 2016. Turkey has been under a state of emergency ever since, with 107,000 public servants and soldiers dismissed from their jobs. More than 50,000 people have been imprisoned pending trial since July 2016. In April 2017,51% of Turkish voters endorsed a new constitutionthat scraps the role of prime minister and grants the president new powers: Directly appointment of top public officials, including ministers and vice-presidents The power to intervene in the country's legal system The power to impose a state of emergency Mr Erdogan called snap elections as Turkey's currency, the lira, has slumped 17% this year against the dollar and the main interest rate has been increased to 17.75%. While Turkey's economy continues to grow strongly - by 7.4% in the first quarter of 2018 - there are fears of a sharp slowdown ahead, and the fall of the lira has hit people's pockets. By winning 52.5% of the vote, he saw off his closest rival, Muharrem Ince, who won just over 30% of the vote. His AK party won 42.5% of the separate parliamentary vote but, together with the nationalist MHP, that gives him a comfortable majority with 343 seats in the 600-seat assembly. The nationalists' success came as a surprise to commentators and a bonus to Mr Erdogan, because the party's vote was widely expected to suffer after a rising star, Meral Aksener, left the party to form her own. A vast crowd attended a rally for opposition candidate Ince in Izmir on Thursday Mr Erdogan continues to win support in his conservative heartland outside the big cities and among expatriate voters in Germany, the Netherlands and France. Under the AKP, Turkey has embraced a moderate Islamism, accepting Islamic symbols in public life to some extent - for example, in allowing female state employees to wear headscarves. By contrast Muharrem Ince's Republican People's Party (CHP) is a staunchly secular party. He attracted mass rallies ahead of the elections in Izmir, Ankara and Istanbul, but while he polled well in the presidential vote, his party was unable to spread its appeal beyond Turkey's secular heartland. The CHP polled about 22%. Despite its leader being in jail and restrictions placed on voters in Kurdish areas of the south-east, the pro-Kurdish party, which is firmly against Mr Erdogan, won 11.6% of the national vote and will continue to play a significant role in parliament.

Communal clashes leave 86 dead in Nigeria,"Nigeria has seen decades of intermittent violence between Berom farmers and Fulani herders (file picture) At least 86 people have died in central Nigeria after violent clashes broke out between farmers and cattle herders, police in Plateau state said. Some reports say fighting began on Thursday when ethnic Berom farmers attacked Fulani herders, killing five of them. A retaliatory attack on Saturday led to more deaths. The area has a decades-long history of violence between ethnic groups competing for land. Earlier, dozens of people were killed in asimilar round of violence between Fulani herders and local hunters in Mali. Who are Nigeria's Fulani herdsmen? Nigeria's tin mine healing world's oldest rift More on Nigeria A curfew has now been imposed in three parts of Plateau state. State police commissioner Undie Adie said a search of villages following the bloodshed revealed that 86 people had been killed, and six injured. He said 50 houses had been burned, as well as 15 motorbikes and two vehicles. The Plateau state government said the curfew would be in place between 18:00 and 06:00 local time (17:00 to 05:00 GMT) in the Riyom, Barikin Ladi and Jos South areas ""to avert a breakdown of law and order"". Analysis by the BBC's Stephanie Hegarty, in Lagos It's an age-old conflict that has recently taken on a new level of brutality. In Nigeria's central region settled farming communities and nomadic cattle herders often clash - usually over access to land and grazing rights. But these tit-for-tat clashes have erupted into inter-communal warfare, killing thousands in the last year. This region, where the Muslim north meets the Christian south is prone to religious tension - herders are ethnic Fulani and mostly Muslim, while the farmers are mostly Christian. But it's not clear why this spike in violence is happening right now. Nigeria's president has repeatedly blamed the escalation on an increase in gun-running from Libya. Others blame security forces' failures in a country busy fighting two insurgences - Boko Haram in the north and militants in the oil-producing south. The state's governor Simon Lalong said work was under way ""to secure the affected communities and fish out perpetrators of these crimes"". ""While we pray for God's guidance through this difficult time, we will do everything humanly possible to secure our state immediately,"" he said. Nigeria's President Muhammadu Buhari - himself a Fulani - is under increasing pressure to address the tensions ahead of elections in 2019. In January he ordered the head of police to relocate to the country's middle beltto manage clashes there. Special forces were also deployed to the central states of Benue, Nasarawa and Taraba to ""secure vulnerable communities and prevent further attacks"". They are believed to be the largest semi-nomadic group in the world, and are found across West and Central Africa - from Senegal to the Central African Republic. In Nigeria, some continue to live as semi-nomadic herders, while other have moved to cities. The nomadic groups spend most of their lives in the bush.

Turkey's Erdogan wins new term,"President Erdogan and his wife Emine greet supporters at his party's Ankara HQ Turkey's long-standing leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan has won a new five-year term after securing outright victory in the first round of a presidential poll. Mr Erdogan got nearly 53% with almost all votes counted. His closest rival Muharrem Ince was on 31%. He will now assume sweeping new powers, won in a controversial referendum last year. The post of PM will be abolished. Mr Ince accepted the result on the basis of poll figures - but said that everything about the vote was unfair. Erdogan's victory - in 100 and 500 words Turks abroad play decisive role in vote How powerful will Erdogan be? Turkey's political giant Final results will be announced on Friday. The polls were the most fiercely fought in many years. Mr Erdogan has presided over a strong economy and built up a solid support base by investing in healthcare, education and infrastructure. But the 64-year-old has also polarised opinion, cracking down on opponents and putting some 160,000 people in jail. Mr Erdogan gave a triumphant victory speech from the balcony of his party's headquarters in the capital Ankara at 03:00 (00:00 GMT), declaring: ""The winner of this election is each and every individual among my 81 million citizens."" Congratulations have come in from Islamic leaders including Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. Russian President Vladimir Putin talked of Mr Erdogan's ""great political authority and mass support"". Supporters of Erdogan and the AK Party took to Istanbul's streets to celebrate Mr Ince, from the Republican People's Party (CHP), said the election was unfair from its declaration to the announcement of the results. Turkey was entering a dangerous period of one-man rule, he added. The young Turks rejecting Islam Full story: Life under President Erdogan But he said that there was no significant difference between official results and his party's figures, and therefore he would accept the outcome. There were another four candidates on the presidential ballot, all of whom fell below 10% of the vote. President Erdogan will assume major new powers under Turkey's new constitution. The changes wereendorsed in a tight referendum last year by 51% of voters, and are due to come into force after the election. They include: Directly appointing top public officials, including ministers and vice-presidents The power to intervene in the country's legal system The power to impose a state of emergency Some critics argue the enhanced role will place too much power in one person's hands, and that Turkey's new system lacks the checks and balances of other executive presidencies like France or the US. Mr Erdogan maintains his increased authority will empower him to address Turkey's economic woes and defeat Kurdish rebels in the country's south-east. In his victory speech, he said Turkey would act more firmly against terrorist groups, and would continue to ""liberate Syrian lands"" so refugees could return to their homes there. Mr Erdogan was prime minister for 11 years before becoming president in 2014. Under the new constitution, he could stand for a third term when his second finishes in 2023, meaning he could potentially hold power until 2028. By Mark Lowen, BBC Turkey correspondent Despite 90% of the media being pro-government and largely shunning the opposition, the president's posters and flags dwarfing any challenge on the streets, the election being held under a state of emergency curtailing protests, and critical journalists and academics being jailed or forced into exile, Mr Erdogan only got half of the country behind him. ""We are living through a fascist regime"", the opposition MP Selin Sayek Boke told the BBC. ""But fascist regimes don't usually win elections with 53%, they win with 90%. So this shows that progressive values are still here and can rise up."" For now, though, this is Mr Erdogan's time. With his sweeping new powers, scrapping the post of prime minister and able to choose ministers and most senior judges, he becomes Turkey's most powerful leader since its founding father Ataturk. He'll now hope to lead the country at least until 2023, a hundred years since Ataturk's creation. And a dejected opposition will have to pick itself up and wonder again if, and how, he can be beaten. Read more from Mark Mr Erdogan said the governing alliance led by his AK Party (AKP) had secured a majority, in a separate vote for the 600-member chamber. State news agency Anadolu said the AKP itself had 42% of the votes for parliament with 99% counted, giving it a projected 293 seats. Its partner, the MHP, had 11% and 50 seats. The opposition CHP won only 23% (146 seats) despite Mr Ince's popularity in the presidential vote, while its nationalist ally the Iyi (Good) party won 10% (44 seats). In a development that will please Kurdish voters, the pro-Kurdish HDP exceeded the 10% threshold needed to enter parliament. With 67 seats, it will form the chamber's second-largest opposition faction. Kurds in Diyarbakir celebrated the HDP's result The party's success comes despite the fact its presidential candidate Selahattin Demirtas is in a high-security prison on terror charges, which he firmly denies. WATCH: Why the Kurdish vote was key Security was tight at polling stations. Ahead of the vote, concerns had been raised about potential voter intimidation and electoral fraud. Voter turnout was high at almost 87%, the state broadcaster reported. Muharrem Ince has accepted the results, though he believes the poll was unfair Rights activists have said the press is not free to report on all sides in Turkey. It has become the world's biggest jailer of journalists under Mr Erdogan's rule, according to monitoring groups. Mr Erdogan has already cautioned his rivals against claiming foul play, saying: ""I hope nobody will try to cast a shadow on the results and harm democracy in order to hide their own failure."" The biggest was the economy. The Turkish lira has tanked and inflation stands at about 11%, though the economy has grown substantially in recent years. The currency has suffered as Mr Erdogan has pressed the central bank not to raise interest rates and suggested before the poll that he might restrict its independence. Terrorism was another key issue, as Turkey faces attacks from Kurdish militants and the jihadists of the Islamic State group. Turkey's brain drain: Crackdown pushes intellectuals out Mr Erdogan's rivals accused him of damaging civil liberties in Turkey and spearheading a slide into authoritarian rule. Turkey has been under a state of emergency since a failed coup in July 2016, with 107,000 public servants and soldiers dismissed from their jobs. More than 50,000 people have been imprisoned pending trial since the uprising. Muharrem Ince attracted huge crowds on the campaign trail CHP candidate Mr Ince's fiery campaigning helped to revitalise Turkey's downtrodden opposition - but ultimately he lacked the numbers to end Mr Erdogan's dominance.

Singles chart to include YouTube videos,"Dua Lipa's New Rules was the most-watched video by British woman in 2017 Since YouTube launched, the streaming site has seen 20 music videos break the two billion views mark. Sitting at the top of the heap is Luis Fonsi's Despacito, which has been watched a staggering 5.2 billion times. But none of these views ever counted towards the song's position on the UK singles chart. That will change on Friday, when the Official Charts Company overhauls its rules to include music video streams and downloads for the first time. Unofficial videos and user-generated content featuring music will not count - but official videos played on YouTube, Apple, Tidal and Spotify in the UK will. Allow YouTube content?

""The way that music fans are consuming music is changing by the month,"" explains the charts' chief executive Martin Talbot. ""It seems anachronistic to be saying, 'we're only going to count the song', when it also has a video attached to it."" The move, which comes exactly four years after audio streams were incorporated into the chart, has been approved by record labels and BBC Radio 1, which broadcasts the chart every Friday. The first chart including video streams will be published on 6 July. The album chart will not be affected. Here's what you need to know about the change. Forty per cent of all music streaming in the UK takes place on YouTube - raising the prospect that stars like Beyonce and Taylor Swift, whose lavish videos rack up millions of views, could benefit most from the changes. Not so, says Martin Talbot. ""This isn't going to be a handbrake turn,"" he tells the BBC.  ""We're not going to suddenly see dozens of songs in the Top 20 that weren't there before."" In test charts, songs with viral videos only received a small upgrade to their chart position. ""The most obvious recent one was Childish Gambino's This Is America,"" says Talbot. ""Everyone was talking about it for days and days - and the week that all happened, it might have been three or four places higher. That was it."" Allow YouTube content?

""It's definitely about time,"" says Years & Years singer Olly Alexander, who's making a video for every song on the band's new album, Palo Santo. ""So many people now just watch the video - they're not even aware of the song separate from it. The fact they'll be considered now for the charts is a good thing."" Dua Lipa is another singer who knows the power of a good music video - after the colourful, upbeat clip for New Rules turbo-boosted her career last year. ""The response to New Rules was so crazy and I am so grateful for it,"" she says, welcoming the chart changes. ""Video was really important to me in my career. It's another way, as artists, that we can get our music to our fans."" Henry Scholfield, who directed New Rules, adds: ""I think its good for the stature of videos. They might become important again. ""What I'm hoping is that this will focus record labels on investing in videos, now that there's a tangibility to the result. If you suddenly have double the budget, you can do something extraordinary. And hopefully pay the crew decently."" In Spain, France and Italy, music played on free, ad-funded services like Spotify and YouTube don't count towards the chart. Although some in the UK were in favour of adopting that approach, the Charts Company decided against it. ""We thought that was too far,"" says Talbot. ""We recognise there are younger fans who maybe don't have access to credit cards, or low-income music fans who can't afford a subscription but will still listen on legitimate, ad-funded streaming services."" Spotify and YouTube both have a limited ""free"" service alongside their subscription platform A separate tweak to the chart formula will see paid-for music streams carrying more weight than ""free"" ones. Under the current system, every 150 streams of a song count as one ""sale"". From Friday, the ratio will drop to 100:1 for users on a premium subscription service; while the free rate shoots up to 600:1. The change will benefit artists who restrict access to their songs on the free versions of Spotify and YouTube - but Talbot promises it will promote new music, too. ""Premium subscribers tend to access new music quicker,"" he says. ""We found in our test charts that new music would enter maybe one place higher than before."" It's also worth noting you can't ""spam"" your favourite artist to number one. Once you've played a song 10 times in 24 hours, subsequent streams are not counted. The Charts Company first considered counting video streams back in 2014. But at the time, YouTube was the only place offering a full video service - and there were concerns over its royalty payments and, supposedly, the clarity of its data (specifically, how long a user needed to watch a video before it counted as one ""play""). ""I can't really go into the details of specific services,"" says Talbot. ""But any concerns we might previously have had, have been dealt with and sorted out.

Turkey's President Erdogan wins new term,"President Erdogan and his wife Emine greet supporters at his party's Ankara HQ Turkey's long-standing leader Recep Tayyip Erdogan has won a new five-year term after securing outright victory in the first round of a presidential poll. Mr Erdogan got nearly 53% with almost all votes counted. His closest rival Muharrem Ince was on 31%. He will now assume sweeping new powers, won in a controversial referendum last year. The post of PM will be abolished. Mr Ince accepted the result on the basis of poll figures - but said that everything about the vote was unfair. Erdogan's victory - in 100 and 500 words Turks abroad play decisive role in vote How powerful will Erdogan be? Turkey's political giant Final results will be announced on Friday. The polls were the most fiercely fought in many years. Mr Erdogan has presided over a strong economy and built up a solid support base by investing in healthcare, education and infrastructure. But the 64-year-old has also polarised opinion, cracking down on opponents and putting some 160,000 people in jail. Mr Erdogan gave a triumphant victory speech from the balcony of his party's headquarters in the capital Ankara at 03:00 (00:00 GMT), declaring: ""The winner of this election is each and every individual among my 81 million citizens."" Congratulations have come in from Islamic leaders including Iranian President Hassan Rouhani. Russian President Vladimir Putin talked of Mr Erdogan's ""great political authority and mass support"". Supporters of Erdogan and the AK Party took to Istanbul's streets to celebrate Mr Ince, from the Republican People's Party (CHP), said the election was unfair from its declaration to the announcement of the results. Turkey was entering a dangerous period of one-man rule, he added. The young Turks rejecting Islam Full story: Life under President Erdogan But he said that there was no significant difference between official results and his party's figures, and therefore he would accept the outcome. There were another four candidates on the presidential ballot, all of whom fell below 10% of the vote. President Erdogan will assume major new powers under Turkey's new constitution. The changes wereendorsed in a tight referendum last year by 51% of voters, and are due to come into force after the election. They include: Directly appointing top public officials, including ministers and vice-presidents The power to intervene in the country's legal system The power to impose a state of emergency Some critics argue the enhanced role will place too much power in one person's hands, and that Turkey's new system lacks the checks and balances of other executive presidencies like France or the US. Mr Erdogan maintains his increased authority will empower him to address Turkey's economic woes and defeat Kurdish rebels in the country's south-east. In his victory speech, he said Turkey would act more firmly against terrorist groups, and would continue to ""liberate Syrian lands"" so refugees could return to their homes there. Mr Erdogan was prime minister for 11 years before becoming president in 2014. Under the new constitution, he could stand for a third term when his second finishes in 2023, meaning he could potentially hold power until 2028. By Mark Lowen, BBC Turkey correspondent Despite 90% of the media being pro-government and largely shunning the opposition, the president's posters and flags dwarfing any challenge on the streets, the election being held under a state of emergency curtailing protests, and critical journalists and academics being jailed or forced into exile, Mr Erdogan only got half of the country behind him. ""We are living through a fascist regime"", the opposition MP Selin Sayek Boke told the BBC. ""But fascist regimes don't usually win elections with 53%, they win with 90%. So this shows that progressive values are still here and can rise up."" For now, though, this is Mr Erdogan's time. With his sweeping new powers, scrapping the post of prime minister and able to choose ministers and most senior judges, he becomes Turkey's most powerful leader since its founding father Ataturk. He'll now hope to lead the country at least until 2023, a hundred years since Ataturk's creation. And a dejected opposition will have to pick itself up and wonder again if, and how, he can be beaten.

SNP MPs 'may not back expansion',"The SNP has withdrawn its support for a third runway at Heathrow airport, hours before a key Commons vote on the move. But the UK government persuaded MPs to give the go-ahead for a third runway, which they say would boost the number of flights to and from Scotland. The Commons supported the government's plan by 415 votes to 119, a majority of 296. The Scottish government has been a longtime backer of the plans, and was still behind them on Sunday. For:415 Against:119 Did not vote:116  But SNP MPs abstained from voting because there were ""no guarantees of the benefits"". It has been projected that the expansion of Heathrow would create at least 100 extra landing slots from Heathrow to Scottish airports each week. Cabinet approves new Heathrow runway Grayling: Heathrow expansion will benefit Scottish airports Scottish government welcomes third runway plan The Scottish government had previously backed Heathrow's bid for a third runway, saying it would bring economic benefits for Scotland. On Sunday, a Transport Scotland spokesman said the government ""supports expansion at Heathrow airport"" and ""looks forward to Scotland seeing the benefits"". However, on the day of the vote, SNP MPs announced they would be abstaining because the UK government had ""failed to make the case"" for the move. Transport spokesman Alan Brown said SNP members ""could not vote for a third runway at Heathrow with no guarantees of the benefits"". Protestors campaigned against the third runway outside the SNP conference in Aberdeen The UK government faced opposition in its own ranks, with a number of Conservatives who represent seats in Heathrow's flight path rebelling. Last week junior trade minister Greg Hands resigned from the government to oppose expansion of Heathrow Airport. Mr Hands, who represents the Chelsea and Fulham constituency in London, said he had pledged to oppose the new runway at the 2017 election. The highest profile opponent of Heathrow expansion in the cabinet is Boris Johnson, the foreign secretary, who once pledged to lie down in front of bulldozers to stop it happening. But he was visiting Afghanistan and unable to attend the vote in the House of Commons. Labour is also divided on the controversial issue, with members of the party's leadership, such as shadow chancellor John McDonnell, opposed to it, but high-profile trade union backers in favour. The party's MPs were allowed to vote however they wanted on the issue. Campaigners argue that a new runway will breach the UK's legal limits on air pollution and increase noise pollution with an extra 700 planes a day.
