There will be no red carpet launch show or Christmas special, either. Contestants will be staying in a hotel for two weeks ahead of pre-recording all the group dances. The full Strictly 2020 line-up Strictly's annual special at Blackpool, filmed in one of the country's most historic ballrooms, is seen by contestants and the professional dancers alike as one of the highlights of the series.

Blackpool is renowned for being a home for ballroom dancing, having hosted the Blackpool Dance Festival since 1920. That event istaking place online this yearas a result of coronavirus. A BBC spokesman said: ""Blackpool is a milestone moment in every series of Strictly that our audience, our celebs and professional dancers look forward to.

"Proms come to close following Rule, Britannia! row","This video can not be played The 2020 Proms season went ahead despite restrictions. Here are some of the highlights. A subdued version of The Last Night of the Proms has been held in London, after a row over Rule, Britannia! threatened to overshadow the event. It saw a pared-down version of the BBC Symphony Orchestra play to an empty Royal Albert Hall, in order to comply with coronavirus restrictions. After a very public row, the patriotic songs Rule, Britannia! and Land Of Hope And Glory were sung by a small choir. The BBC was criticised for plans to omit the lyrics last month. Critics said the words evoked a British colonial, imperialist past that is at odds with the values of modern Britain and the Black Lives Matter movement. Last Night of the Proms will play Rule, Britannia Proms concerts will change depending on Covid rules Proms to open with Beethoven 'mash-up' The BBC insisted its original decision had been driven less by politics than by the limitations imposed on musicians, and choirs in particular, during the pandemic. But after a backlash in the press, and an intervention by Prime Minister Boris Johnson, it reinstated the lyrics, saying socially-distanced members of the BBC Singers would perform in the Royal Albert Hall's otherwise empty stalls. After the possible omission, and then the indecision, followed by the controversy, and the accusations of wetness - Britannia finally did rule the airwaves. And so tradition prevailed over those who thought the words too imperialistic for this day and age. But it wasn't quite business as usual at this year's Last Night: it was a Prom without promenaders, with a pared down, socially distanced BBC Symphony Orchestra led by the Finnish conductor Dalia Stasevska, and barely a flag or a hat in sight. The Scottish violinist Nicola Benedetti - a late replacement for a poorly soloist - played Vaughan Williams's romantic pastoral favourite, The Lark Ascending The talking point of the night is likely to be composer Errollyn Wallen's radical re-working of Hubert Parry's Prom favourite Jerusalem, to which she introduced dissonance and blues references - a tribute, she said, to the Windrush generation of migrants who came to Britain. It was sung, brilliantly, by the South African soprano Golda Schultz. It has been a very strange year; the Pandemic Proms quite different without a live audience, particularly this evening's Last Night in which even Edward Elgar's Land of Hope and Glory seemed subdued. The 2020 Proms season was drastically curtailed by the coronavirus epidemic, with the usual eight-week season cut down to a fortnight of live shows, performed without an audience. The programme was simplified in other ways, too - mostly featuring smaller works, with UK-based soloists and orchestras. A reduced orchestra of 65 instead of the usual 300 performed live at the Royal Albert Hall - with the singers stood in the stalls to ensure social distancing. However, there were some successful attempts to make the best of the situation. On the opening weekend, Simon Rattle and the London Symphony Orchestra positioned their brass players in boxes around the Albert Hall, answering and colliding with each other as they played Giovanni Gabrieli's brass Canzons.

Folk singer Laura Marling also made her Proms debut, playing an intimate set of songs accompanied by an un-conducted string orchestra the 12 Ensemble. And the Aurora Orchestra played Beethoven's 7th Symphony from memory while standing (as has become their trademark)  drawing praise and admiration on social media. Allow Twitter content?

Their performance was paired with a new work by Richard Ayres who, like Beethoven, has suffered from hearing loss for the last 20 years. In three separate pieces - subtitled ""dreaming, hearing loss and saying goodbye"" - the players evoked the experience of degraded hearing, with string lines infiltrated by the high-pitched whine of tinnitus, and musical motifs blurring and breaking down. Finnish conductor Dalia Stasevska said she ""played no role in deciding the traditional elements of the programme"" following the controversy over the Last Night. The Last Night opened with Mozart's perennially popular The Marriage Of Figaro, and featured South-African soprano Golda Schultz singing Sondheim's The Glamorous Life, and a new arrangement of Jerusalem, by composer Errollyn Wallen. The British composer, who was born in Belize, said her arrangement of the ""treasured hymn... created a lot of strong feelings"" among the Proms audience ""which, as a composer, is what you want"". She said the opportunity to arrange it for the Proms had been ""amazing"", as she had grown up with the original and loved it. She dedicated her version to the Windrush generation - ""I could have been one of those people sent home again,"" she told BBC Breakfast. Describing the socially distanced Last Night as ""magical"", she said: ""The spirit of people who love music was definitely in the hall."" Violinist Nicola Benedetti was a last-minute replacement for Lisa Batiashvili, who pulled out due to illness, playing Vaughan Williams's The Lark Ascending. In a pre-recorded video segment, the conductor, Dalia Stasevska, said: ""During these challenging times, we musicians have been longing so much to be able to play together again and to play live. ""Being able to play together again during these last two weeks has felt like drinking water after a long thirst."" BBC Proms - official site The BBC said next year's Proms would see Rule, Britannia! and Land Of Hope And Glory sung in full, replicating a tradition that dates back at least to the 1950s. Rule, Britannia! was set to music by Thomas Arne in 1740, and its lyrics were based on a poem by James Thomson. It contains verses such as:""Rule, Britannia! rule the waves / Britons never will be slaves."" Land Of Hope And Glory makes similar reference to the ""might"" of the former British Empire, which some people today find problematic. Speaking in August, Chi-chi Nwanoku, the founder of Chineke!, an orchestra that has performed at the Proms and whose musicians are majority black, Asian and ethnically diverse, said Rule, Britannia! was ""offensive"". She added that any black person ""aware of their history, the empire and colonialism"" would ""struggle to enjoy the patriotic jingoism of these songs"". Chi-chi Nwanoku's Chineke! Foundation is about ""championing change and celebrating diversity in classical music"" Broadcaster Jonathan Dimbleby said he had always found that part of the last night ""uncomfortable"", suggesting the ""delusory"" second line be changed to: ""Britons never, never, never shall be knaves"". The BBC said it had originally planned to play the songs in an orchestral version due to coronavirus restrictions - although singers were due to perform on other nights of the Proms. Prime Minister Boris Johnson voiced his objection to the original decision, telling MPs: ""People love our traditions and our history with all its imperfections"", adding attempts to ""censor"" it were ""crazy"". The BBC later reversed the decision, saying: ""Both pieces will now include a select group of BBC Singers"", explaining the words would be sung in the Hall, with audiences free to sing along at home. It came after director-general Lord Hall was succeeded in the role by Tim Davie, the former chief executive of commercial arm BBC Studios.

Designer Sir Terence Conran dies aged 88,"Sir Terence's empire spanned restaurants, furniture and architecture Sir Terence Conran, the British designer who revolutionised retail and decor, has died at the age of 88. Best known as the founder of Habitat, he brought modern style and simplicity to UK homes in the 1960s and later helped found the Design Museum. ""He was a visionary who enjoyed an extraordinary life and career that revolutionised the way we live in Britain,"" said a family statement. ""He was adored by his family and friends and we will miss him dearly."" Sir Terence at the launch of the Swinging London exhibition at the Fashion and Textile Museum in 2019 Obituary: Sir Terence Conran The statement added: ""It gives us great comfort to know that many of you will mourn with us but we ask that you celebrate Terence's extraordinary legacy and contribution to the country he loved so dearly."" He ""promoted the best of British design, culture and the arts around the world"", with ""a very simple belief that good design improves the quality of people's lives"". Sir Terence started his career in the late 1940s, but became a household name as one of the key designers of the swinging '60s. His empire would go on to span restaurants, architecture and household retail brands including Mothercare, but it was for his accessible and fashionable furniture, interiors and homeware that he remains best-known. Pictured in the Terence Conran Suite at Boundary in Shoreditch in 2009 He pioneered flat-pack furniture years before Ikea arrived on British shores, helping to lower the prices of his cutting-edge designs in his bid to ""democratise good design"". Design Museum director Tim Marlow led the tributes, saying it was ""a privilege and an inspiration to know him"". In a statement, Marlow wrote: ""Terence Conran was instrumental in the re-designing of post-war Britain and his legacy is huge. ""He is revered by generations of designers, from Mary Quant and David Mellor to Thomas Heatherwick and Jonny Ive. ""He changed the way we lived and shopped and ate. He also created a great institution - the Design Museum - of which he was justifiably proud and with which he remained fully engaged right to the end of his extraordinary life."" Designer and architect George Clarke, gardener and broadcaster Monty Don, and restaurant critic Marina O'Loughlin were among others paying tribute. Allow Twitter content?

After studying textile design and setting up his own furniture studio, Conran joined an architectural firm in 1950 and worked on the subsequent year's Festival of Britain. As the '50s went on, his ambitious and wide-ranging approach to design and business became clear. A furniture workshop, a French-inspired restaurant and a coffee shop eventually led him to form the Conran Design Group. The company also designed interiors and retail spaces, including a shop for pioneering '60s fashion designer Quant. Conran opened the first Habitat store on the Fulham Road in 1964, selling taste-making and trend-setting furniture, art, home and cookery products to a burgeoning young clientele who wanted to break from drab post-war austerity. Shoppers in a Habitat store in 1973 ""It is hard to overstate how uninteresting London was then,"" he later said. ""You could go along a terrace of houses, and every living room you looked in was the exactly the same, with the same extremely dreary furniture."" Conran was heavily influenced by continental European styles, and is credited with introducing duvets to Britain. Habitat rapidly expanded across the UK, and he went on to take over Mothercare and British Home Stores, as well as running other ventures, such as his extensive and influential restaurant business - including Bibendum and Quaglino's - and The Conran Shop. He also wrote numerous books about design and food. ""The restaurants, hotels and bars we have designed or operated, the shops, the interiors, the buildings, the products and furniture or the books I have written - design is the one thing that connects them all and they add up to what I call a style of life,"" he said. He was married four times, including to Shirley Conran, who helped launch Conran Design before becoming the author of self-help books like Superwoman and the racy bestseller Lace. Their sons Jasper and Sebastian Conran both became designers, while his other three children - Tom, Sophie and Ned - by his third wife, food writer Caroline, have forged successful careers in the creative sector, notably in food writing and as restaurateurs.

"Brexit bill protects UK 'integrity', says minister","This video can not be played Michael Gove: ""What we can't have... is the EU disrupting or putting at threat the integrity of the UK"" Michael Gove has defended plans to override parts of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement as a means of protecting the ""integrity"" of the UK. The Cabinet Office minister said the UK was being ""generous"" with the EU over the Brexit negotiations. The EU has threatened legal action over the Internal Market Bill, which ministers say will break international law in a ""specific and limited way"". PM Boris Johnson is urging Tory MPs to back it, after some raised concerns. Thebill,external, which will be formally debated in the House of Commons for the first time on Monday, addresses the Northern Ireland Protocol - the part of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement designed to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland. If this became law it would give UK ministers powers to modify or ""disapply"" rules relating to the movement of goods between Britain and Northern Ireland that will come into force from 1 January, if the UK and EU are unable to strike a trade deal. Analysis: Despite bitter Brexit row can deal still be done? UK signs first major post-Brexit trade deal Brexit to dominate week ahead in Parliament UK at odds with EU over approval for food exports Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis told the Commons the bill, which would go against the Withdrawal Agreement signed by the UK and EU, would ""break international law in a very specific and limited way"". But Mr Gove said the attorney general had said the proposal would be consistent with the rule of law - and that it was important to have an ""insurance policy"". He insisted the government was being ""proportionate and generous"" in its approach to the EU talks. Mr Gove said: ""These steps are a safety net, they're a long-stop in the event, which I don't believe will come about but we do need to be ready for, that the EU follow through on what some have said they might do which is, in effect, to separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom."" While admitting it was a ""crunch moment"", he insisted ""we have got the support of our own MPs"". The EU and UK have less than five weeks to agree a deal before Mr Johnson's 15 October deadline - after which he says he is prepared to ""walk away"". Informal talks are due to resume on Monday, with the next official round of talks - the ninth since March - starting in Brussels on 28 September. The EU says the planned changes must be scrappedor they risk jeopardising the UK-EU trade talksand  the European Parliament says will  ""under no circumstances ratify"" any trade deal reached between the UK and EU if the ""UK authorities breach or threaten to breach"" the Withdrawal Agreement. Boris Johnson said he would not countenance ""the threat of a border down the Irish Sea"" On Friday Mr Johnson had a Zoom call with about 250 of his MPs, in whichhe said the party could not return to ""miserable squabbling"" over Europe. Conservative backbencher Sir Bob Neill, who chairs the Commons Justice Committee, said he was not reassured by the prime minister's Zoom call. He is tabling an amendment to the bill to try to force a separate parliamentary vote on any changes to the Withdrawal Agreement. ""I believe it is potentially a harmful act for this country, it would damage our reputation and I think it will make it harder to strike trade deals going forward,"" he said. And on Saturday, Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood - who is chairman of the Defence Select Committee - also voiced his concern. ""I don't want us to lose our way, to lose our reputation as a force for good, as an exemplar holding up the international rule of law,"" he said. ""I'm afraid that's where I find myself not wishing to support this particular bill, because it does mean that we would be challenging unilaterally a Treaty. And that goes against the principle of everything we stand for."" Former Conservative party leaders Theresa May, Lord Howard and Sir John Major are also among senior figures urging Mr Johnson to think again. Both Ireland and the EU have warned that Mr Johnson's plans pose a serious risk to the peace process rather than protecting the Good Friday Agreement, as the government claims. Writing that it had become clear there might be a ""serious misunderstanding"" between the UK and EU over the Withdrawal Agreement, Mr Johnson said the UK must be protected from what he called a ""disaster"" of the EU being able to ""carve up our country"" and ""endanger peace and stability in Northern Ireland"". He said there was still a ""very good chance"" of the UK and EU striking a deal by mid-October similar to that previouslyagreed between the EU and Canada- which got rid of most, but not all, tariffs on goods. But in a column in the Daily Telegraph,external, he accused the EU of adopting an ""extreme"" interpretation of the Northern Ireland Protocol to impose ""a full-scale trade border down the Irish Sea"" that could stop the transport of food from Britain to Northern Ireland. Mr Gove told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it would be ""irrational"" not to allow the transportation of food in such a way, which would happen if the UK was not grantedthird-country listing. Such a listing is needed for the export of food.

Dig reveals 'one of the largest' Roman temples,"The temple would have been a ""major landmark in the region"", according to archaeologist Will Bowden A dig has revealed ""one of the largest"" temple buildings in Roman Britain. The 2nd Century temple site at Caistor St Edmund, near Norwich, has been known about since 1957, but its true scale has only just emerged. It was built by the Iceni tribe, best known for their leaderBoudiccawho rebelled against the Romans in AD61. Archaeologist Prof Will Bowden said its size, 20m by 20m (65ft by 65ft), showed ""how important this cult was to the Iceni"". The depth of the foundations indicates a substantial masonry building up to 15m (49ft) high Thecommunity archaeology group Caistor Roman Project,externalspent three weeks at the temple site in 2019, working in partnership with the University of Nottingham. Prof Bowden, the project director, said the post-excavation process had since been completed and this ""confirmed that we were looking at a building that was exceptional"". He said it was ""one of the largest of its type in Roman Britain"" which ""indicates not only the importance with which the site was regarded but also that the Iceni had the resources to construct major public buildings should they choose to"". Who was Boudicca? It has remained unknown which gods were worshipped there. Evidence of the worship of Roman gods has been found but the Iceni could have also dedicated the temple to a local deity,as happened at Bath,external. The 2nd Century building, which was built on the site of an earlier Romano-Celtic temple, was surrounded by a precinct with two gates Boudicca led her Iceni tribe in a revolt against the Romans between AD60 and AD61 Caistor was the site of Venta Icenorum, the smallest Roman regional capital in Britain. Its forum - the main public building - was less than a quarter of the size of Verulamium, now known as St Albans. Historians saw its small scale as a sign of the Iceni's impoverishment after Queen Boudicca led the Iceni tribe against the Romans.

Motorways to trial 60mph limits to cut pollution,"The speed limit will be cut to 60mph in areas with higher levels of nitrogen dioxide The speed limit will be cut on parts of four motorways before October in a trial to reduce pollution, Highways England has said. It will be reduced from 70mph to 60mph in areas that have seen higher than recommended levels of nitrogen dioxide. The trial will take place on stretches of nearly five miles. It will be on M6 junctions 6 to 7 by Witton, M1 junctions 33 to 34 by Rotherham, M602 junctions 1 to 3 by Eccles and M5 1 to 2 by Oldbury. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2)released from car exhausts is a serious air pollutant and indirectly contributes to the warming of the planet. The impact of the new 60mph limit will be reviewed in a year's time Ivan Le Fevre, head of environment at Highways England said: ""Ultimately the air quality challenge will be solved 'at the tailpipe' by vehicle manufacturers and changes in vehicle use. ""Until this happens we will continue our extensive programme of pioneering research and solutions."" The Department for Transport said the trial was among a number of measures to improve air quality. As part of a plan to bring down NO2 levels, the government aims to end the sale of all new conventional petrol and diesel cars and vans before 2040. It has been consulting on bringing this forward to 2035, or earlier if a faster transition appears feasible, as well as looking at including hybrids for the first time.

Dozens missing in Oregon amid West Coast wildfires,"Wildfires swept through the town of Berry Creek in California More than 30 people have been killed by wildfires that are sweeping through US West Coast states, officials say. Dozens of people are missing in Oregon alone, with one emergency official saying the state should be preparing for a ""mass fatality incident"". Fires have been raging in Oregon, California and Washington for three weeks, burning millions of acres of land and destroying thousands of homes. Tens of thousands of people have been forced to flee their homes. Democratic presidential challenger Joe Biden warned on Saturday that ""climate change poses an imminent, existential threat to our way of life"" and  accused President Donald Trump, a climate sceptic, of denying ""that reality"". Mr Trump, who is due to visit California on Monday to be briefed on the latest situation, blames the wildfires on poor forest management. In pictures: Oregon fires force thousands to flee Smoke from California wildfires turns skies orange False claims about Oregon fires spread online The fires have now scorched an area of land the size of New Jersey, officials say. Oregon's Molalla is now an ash-covered ghost town after a mass evacuation The smoke pollution from the wildfires has left Oregon's largest city, Portland, with the worst air quality in the world, followed by San Francisco and Seattle,according to IQAir.com,external. A really simple guide to climate change In Oregon, where firefighters are battling 16 large blazes, 40,000 people are under mandatory evacuation orders. Oregon's Office of Emergency Management (OEM) says the fires have killed 10 people, but officials warn the final death toll could be much higher. Oregon's Fire Marshal Jim Walker resigned on Saturday, shortly after he had been placed on leave amid a personnel investigation. Earlier this week, Governor Kate Brown implored householders to stay out of the fire zones despite reports of looting. ""Let me assure you that we have the Oregon National Guard and Oregon State Police monitoring the situation and preventing looting,"" she said. This video can not be played Drone footage shows homes completely wiped out by wildfires Beatriz Gomez Bolanos, 41, told Reuters news agency of her family's frightening drive to safety through fires burning on both sides of their car. She told her four children to close their eyes as they made their escape. ""Everything is gone. We have to start again from nothing, but we are alive,"" she told the news agency. At least one blaze in Oregon - the Almeda Fire, one of the most destructive in the state - is being treated as suspected arson. In Washington state, firefighters are tackling 15 large fires. A one-year-old boy died earlier this week as his family tried to escape a blaze. His parents remain in a critical condition. Governor Gavin Newsom, a Democrat, on Friday inspected damage from the North Complex Fire, near Oroville in Northern California. ""The debate is over, around climate change,"" Mr Newsom told reporters. ""This is a climate damn emergency. This is real and it's happening."" He acknowledged failings in forest management in recent decades, but added: ""That's one point, but it's not the point."" Highlighting the states effort to combat climate change, he said the record heat waves and unprecedented fires were the sort of problems long forecast by scientists. This video can not be played Five ways that show the scale of California's 2020 wildfires President Trump has argued that California could prevent wildfires if it raked forest floors properly. ""You've got to clean your forests - there are many, many years of leaves and broken trees and they're like, so flammable,"" he told a rally last month. ""I've been telling them this now for three years. But they don't want to listen."" The North Complex Fire, which has been burning since 18 August, is among the deadliest in history. Twelve bodies have been found so far and a number of people are still missing. California has seen at least 22 deaths in total from fires since 15 August. Tens of thousands of people are under evacuation orders as 14,800 firefighters continue to combat 28 major fires in the state. Have you been affected by the US wildfires?

Afghan government urges ceasefire with Taliban,"The Taliban has sent several delegates to the talks The Afghan government has called for a humanitarian ceasefire with the Taliban, as the first-ever peace talks between the two sides began in Qatar. Abdullah Abdullah, who led the government's delegation, stressed that there was ""no winner through war"". The Taliban did not mention a truce, reiterating instead that Afghanistan should be under Islamic law. The US encouraged both sides to reach an agreement, telling them: ""The entire world wants you to succeed"". Afghanistan has seen four decades of conflict, with tens of thousands of civilians killed. The historic talks began on Saturday, one day after the 19th anniversary of the deadly 9/11 al-Qaeda attacks in New York, that led to the US beginning military operations in Afghanistan. Prominent women attacked as Afghanistan eyes peace What to expect from new Taliban peace talks The girl who picked up an AK-47 to defend her family The conflict in Afghanistan has been the longest in US history. These are the first direct talks between the Taliban and representatives of the Afghan government. The militants had until now refused to meet the government, calling them powerless and American ""puppets"". The conflict is still continuing in Afghanistan, and the government says 12,000 civilians have been killed since February. At Saturday's opening ceremony, the head of Afghanistan's peace council, Abdullah Abdullah, called for an immediate ceasefire, telling Reuters ""one of the top most issues on the minds of the people is reduction in violence in a significant way"". Abdullah Abdullah said his team hoped to ""close the gates of war and pain forever"" He added that his delegation ""represents a political system that is supported by millions of men and women from a diversity of cultural, social and ethnic backgrounds in our homeland"", and that they hoped ""to close the gates of war and pain forever"". Taliban leader Mullah Baradar Akhund, meanwhile, said he hoped negotiations would ""move forward with patience"". He added he wanted Afghanistan to be ""independent, united, and... have an Islamic system in which all tribes and ethnicities of the country find themselves without any discrimination"". This video can not be played Tens of thousands of Afghan soldiers have been killed and injured. This is their story The United States reached its own deal with the Taliban in February, and described the talks as a ""truly momentous"" opportunity. ""I think everyone sitting here today knows that it took hard work and sacrifice to reach this moment,"" Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said. ""The entire world wants you to succeed, and is counting on you to succeed."" Many Afghans who've travelled here described this day as emotional. Today was about symbolism and a start to end a war which has touched every part of Afghanistan, and every family. Both sides say today's first discussions on procedural issues have gone much better than expected, but on many other questions there are deep differences - the timing of a ceasefire, the shape of the political system, the extent of personal freedoms. But more than anything else, the biggest issue is how to end a war now described as the deadliest in the world. Everyone taking part in the talks has acknowledged that they will be challenging. Many worry that fragile progress made in women's rights could be sacrificed,externalin the process, with one women's rights activist pointing out that ""there is not a single woman"" in the Taliban's negotiating team. The talks also present a challenge to the Taliban, who will have to bring forward a tangible political vision for Afghanistan. They have so far been vague, stating they wish to see an ""Islamic"" but also ""inclusive"" government. The talks may provide more evidence of how the militant group has changed since the 1990s, when they ruled using a harsh interpretation of Sharia law.

"Motorways to trial 60mph limits to cut pollutionThe speed limit will be reduced in Witton, Rotherham, Eccles and Oldbury.England","The speed limit will be cut to 60mph in areas with higher levels of nitrogen dioxide The speed limit will be cut on parts of four motorways before October in a trial to reduce pollution, Highways England has said. It will be reduced from 70mph to 60mph in areas that have seen higher than recommended levels of nitrogen dioxide. The trial will take place on stretches of nearly five miles. It will be on M6 junctions 6 to 7 by Witton, M1 junctions 33 to 34 by Rotherham, M602 junctions 1 to 3 by Eccles and M5 1 to 2 by Oldbury. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2)released from car exhausts is a serious air pollutant and indirectly contributes to the warming of the planet. The impact of the new 60mph limit will be reviewed in a year's time Ivan Le Fevre, head of environment at Highways England said: ""Ultimately the air quality challenge will be solved 'at the tailpipe' by vehicle manufacturers and changes in vehicle use. ""Until this happens we will continue our extensive programme of pioneering research and solutions."" The Department for Transport said the trial was among a number of measures to improve air quality. As part of a plan to bring down NO2 levels, the government aims to end the sale of all new conventional petrol and diesel cars and vans before 2040.

Dig reveals 'one of the largest' Roman templesThe find shows the wealth of the Iceni tribe in the centuries after Boudicca's rebellion.,"The temple would have been a ""major landmark in the region"", according to archaeologist Will Bowden A dig has revealed ""one of the largest"" temple buildings in Roman Britain. The 2nd Century temple site at Caistor St Edmund, near Norwich, has been known about since 1957, but its true scale has only just emerged. It was built by the Iceni tribe, best known for their leaderBoudiccawho rebelled against the Romans in AD61. Archaeologist Prof Will Bowden said its size, 20m by 20m (65ft by 65ft), showed ""how important this cult was to the Iceni"". The depth of the foundations indicates a substantial masonry building up to 15m (49ft) high Thecommunity archaeology group Caistor Roman Project,externalspent three weeks at the temple site in 2019, working in partnership with the University of Nottingham. Prof Bowden, the project director, said the post-excavation process had since been completed and this ""confirmed that we were looking at a building that was exceptional"". He said it was ""one of the largest of its type in Roman Britain"" which ""indicates not only the importance with which the site was regarded but also that the Iceni had the resources to construct major public buildings should they choose to"". Who was Boudicca? It has remained unknown which gods were worshipped there. Evidence of the worship of Roman gods has been found but the Iceni could have also dedicated the temple to a local deity,as happened at Bath,external. The 2nd Century building, which was built on the site of an earlier Romano-Celtic temple, was surrounded by a precinct with two gates Boudicca led her Iceni tribe in a revolt against the Romans between AD60 and AD61 Caistor was the site of Venta Icenorum, the smallest Roman regional capital in Britain. Its forum - the main public building - was less than a quarter of the size of Verulamium, now known as St Albans. Historians saw its small scale as a sign of the Iceni's impoverishment after Queen Boudicca led the Iceni tribe against the Romans.

Iran executes wrestler despite global outcry,"Iran has executed a wrestler accused of murder, defying international appeals for him to be spared. Navid Afkari, 27, was sentenced to death over the murder of a security guard during a wave of anti-government protests in 2018. He said he had been tortured into making a confession. Human rights organisation Amnesty International described Afkari's execution as a ""travesty of justice"". In a leaked recording released by the group, Afkari says: ""If I am executed, I want you to know that an innocent person, even though he tried and fought with all his strength to be heard, was executed."" Afkari was executed by hanging in the southern city of Shiraz, according to state media. His lawyer said his client had been prevented from seeing his family before his death, as required under Iranian law. ""Were you in such a hurry to carry out the sentence that you deprived Navid of a last visit?"" Hassan Younesi said on Twitter. There had been many calls to stop the execution, including from a union representing 85,000 athletes worldwide. The World Players Association said he had been ""unjustly targeted"" for taking part in the protests, and called for Iran's expulsion from world sport if it went ahead with the execution. US President Donald Trump also appealed for mercy, saying the wrestler's ""sole act was an anti-government demonstration on the streets"". The International Olympic Committee (IOC) called his execution ""very sad news"" and said their thoughts were with his family and friends. ""It is deeply upsetting that the pleas of athletes from around the world and all the behind-the-scenes work of the IOC... did not achieve our goal,""their statement said,external. Why were there protests in Iran in 2018? Iran protesters 'flogged and electrocuted' Afkari's brothers Vahid and Habib were sentenced to 54 and 27 years in prison in the same case, according to human rights activists in Iran. In an audio recording leaked from the prison where he was being held, Afkari had said he had been tortured. His mother said her sons were forced to testify against each other. His lawyer had said on Twitter that, contrary to Iranian news reports, there was no video of the moment of the security guard's killing. He added that footage used as evidence in the case was taken an hour before the crime took place. The Iranian authorities have denied accusations of torture. Afkari was a national champion in wrestling, a sport that has a long history and is hugely popular in Iran. In 2018, protesters in cities across Iran took to the streets over economic hardship and political repression.

Afghan-Taliban talks a rare 'opportunity for peace'The talks aim to end decades of war - but there are concerns over the protection of women's rights.Asia,"Abdullah Abdullah (centre), head of the Afghan government's delegation, called for a humanitarian ceasefire The first-ever peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban are under way in the Gulf state of Qatar. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the talks a ""truly momentous"" breakthrough, while the head of Afghanistan's peace council called it an ""exceptional opportunity for peace"". The Taliban did not mention a truce, reiterating instead that Afghanistan should be under Islamic law. These talks follow a US-Taliban security deal reached in February. Afghanistan has seen four decades of conflict, with tens of thousands of civilians killed. These are the first direct talks between the Taliban and representatives of the Afghan government. The militants had until now refused to meet the government, calling them powerless and American ""puppets"". The two sides are aiming for political reconciliation and an end to decades of violence, which began with the 1979 Soviet invasion. Three generations after a bomb blast in Balkh province - many Afghans have never known peace US-led troops have been present in Afghanistan for nearly two decades, after launching air strikes to oust the Taliban in 2001 following the deadly 9/11 al-Qaeda attacks in New York. At 19 years, the conflict in Afghanistan has been the longest in US history. One senior Afghan negotiator, Nader Nadery, told the BBC it was ""an emotional, but very very difficult and important day."" ""All of us have lost loved ones and the country that we love so much has been destroyed... it's also difficult because you face the people who, as an example in my case, killed my nephew two weeks ago. And we need to pull all the strength to face them, to talk to them."" Everyone taking part in the talks has acknowledged that they will be challenging - there are deep disagreements between the two sides, and the conflict is still continuing in Afghanistan. A Taliban spokesman told the BBC it was ""good progress"" that both sides were talking rather than fighting Mr Pompeo, who spoke at the opening of the talks, said there would ""undoubtedly"" be ""many challenges"" - but stressed that a peace deal would benefit future generations, and also affect how much aid the US provided in the years to follow. Abdullah Abdullah, the head of Afghanistan's delegation, said the two sides ""do not have to agree 100% on each of the issues before us"", but said he hoped for a humanitarian ceasefire and a peace ""accepted and supported by all Afghan citizens"". At the conference Taliban leader Mullah Baradar Akhund called for Afghanistan to have an ""Islamic system in which all tribes and ethnicities... live their lives in love and brotherhood"". ""Negotiations may have problems but should move forward with patience,"" he added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

The talks also present a challenge to the Taliban, who will have to bring forward a tangible political vision for Afghanistan. They have so far been vague, stating they wish to see an ""Islamic"" but also ""inclusive"" government. The talks may provide more evidence of how the militant group has changed since the 1990s, when they ruled using a harsh interpretation of Sharia law. In a statement, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said ""sacrifices"" from ""Afghans and our own troops"" had helped improve the quality of life for people in the country, particularly for women. ""These sacrifices were not made in vain,"" he said. ""The talks starting today must preserve these gains to reflect the hopes and wishes of all Afghan men and women."" He added that the alliance was ""adjusting [its] troop presence"" in the country in support of the peace process. Emotional, nervous, cautiously hopeful, worried - just some of the words spoken by Afghans to express their feelings in this moment. In a country where turning points of the past have veered into yet more violence, everyone speaks of a profound yearning for peace. But everyone knows too of the hurdles ahead. After the opening speeches, a Taliban leader remarked: ""Isn't it better to talk together than to fight each other?"" An Afghan diplomat was at pains to point out that everyone who spoke in the opening ceremony called for a ceasefire - except the Taliban. But an Afghan politician noted, positively, Taliban leader Mullah Baradar's statement where he mentioned the difficulties, but also the readiness to resolve them. The words that matter most will come when Afghans sit down for their first formal face-to-face talks. What matters just as much is what happens on the battlefield still burning back home. The US-Taliban agreement reached in February set out a timetable for the withdrawal of foreign forces, in exchange for counter-terrorism guarantees. The US and its Nato allies agreed to withdraw all troops within 14 months, while the Taliban committed not to allow al-Qaeda or any other extremist group to operate in the areas they control. The US also agreed to lift sanctions against the Taliban and work with the UN to lift its separate sanctions against the group, as well as cutting its troop numbers in the country from about 12,000 to 8,600 and closing several bases. The deal also provided for a prisoner swap of about 5,000 Taliban prisoners and 1,000 detained Afghan security personnel. Taliban prisoners preparing to leave a government prison in Kabul in August Talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban were meant to begin in March but were repeatedly delayed by a dispute over prisoner exchange arrangements, as well as violence in the country. Some of the men the Taliban wanted freed were commanders believed to have been involved in major attacks. ""We cannot release the killers of our people,"" a government negotiator said at the time. According to a report by the Washington Post last month, three Afghans accused of involvement in the deaths of US troops were also a sticking point. Taliban peace talks: What to expect The Afghan war: The short and long story Who are the Taliban? Progress was slow, but in August the Afghan government began to free the final 400 Taliban prisoners, after the move wasapproved by a grand assembly, or loya jirgaof elders. Not all of the group of 400 were released straight away, after both France and Australia objected to freeing six prisoners accused of fatal attacks against their nationals, including humanitarian workers. Their release and transfer to Doha on the eve of talks removed the final hurdle. US-led troops have been present in Afghanistan for nearly two decades, after launching air strikes to oust the Taliban in 2001 following the deadly 9/11 al-Qaeda attacks in New York. The Taliban, who protected al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, had refused to hand him over. Women in the crosshairs as Afghanistan eyes peace The Afghan women determined not to lose out 'They tried to kill my mother in front of me, twice' At the outset in 2001, the US was joined in its fight by an international coalition, and the Taliban were quickly removed from power. But the militant group morphed into an insurgent force that dug in and launched deadly attacks against US-led forces and the Afghan military, as well as Afghan government officials. This video can not be played Is peace with the Taliban possible? The international coalition ended its combat mission in 2014. The total coalition death toll by that point was nearly 3,500. More than 2,400 US military personnel have been killed. The UK lost more than 450 of its soldiers. The Watson Institute at Brown University estimated in November 2019,externalthat more than 43,000 civilians had been killed, with 64,000 Afghan security personnel and 42,000 anti-government fighters dead. The true numbers will never be known. The US continued its own, scaled-back combat operation after 2014, including air strikes.

It follows changes made to the show due to coronavirus restrictions. Beginning on 12 October, the forthcoming BBC One series will be shorter than usual. There will be no red carpet launch show or Christmas special, either. Contestants will be staying in a hotel for two weeks ahead of pre-recording all the group dances. The full Strictly 2020 line-up Strictly's annual special at Blackpool, filmed in one of the country's most historic ballrooms, is seen by contestants and the professional dancers alike as one of the highlights of the series. The show has filmed at the venue since 2004, taking regular breaks. However, since 2013 there has been a Blackpool special annually. Blackpool is renowned for being a home for ballroom dancing, having hosted the Blackpool Dance Festival since 1920. That event istaking place online this yearas a result of coronavirus. A BBC spokesman said: ""Blackpool is a milestone moment in every series of Strictly that our audience, our celebs and professional dancers look forward to.

Coronavirus testing system 'falling over'Many people report being told no test sites were available when applying for a coronavirus swab.,"People across England have told BBC News they are struggling to access coronavirus tests. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said last week that no-one should have to travel more than 75 miles for a test, after the BBC revealedsome were being sent hundreds of miles away. But dozens have now reported being unable to book a swab at all. The Department of Health and Social Care (DHSC) said testing capacity was targeted at the hardest-hit areas. A significant rise in demand for testing led the government to reduce the number of appointments available in areas of lower prevalence, to prioritise areas with outbreaks. This in turn led to people applying for tests being directed to centres sometimes hundreds of miles away. R number above 1 as coronavirus cases rise What are the challenges of mass testing? Concerns over PM's mass virus testing plans But last Thursday Mr Hancock pledged to put in ""immediate"" solutions to make sure people did not have to travel more than 75 miles, effective from last Friday. Since then, postcodes entered into the government's booking system return a message suggesting there are no testing centres or home kits available - even if you are an essential worker with symptoms. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said he understood it would be ""naturally worrying"" for people with symptoms who could not secure a test in a ""timely way"". He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the testing system was under ""pressure"" because of the spike in the infection rate of the virus. Mr Gove said: ""We are increasing the number of tests. It is the case that the capacity every day is for 370,000 - we do want to do more."" He added that No 10 is working to boost capacity through investment in new testing centres and so-called lighthouse labs. 'Complete nightmare' Melissa, a GP in north-west England, applied for a test for her seven-year-old son on Tuesday after he developed a new continuous cough and changes to his sense of taste. After being offered a test in Sunderland, about 130 miles away, she applied via her local NHS's staff portal - designed to prioritise health staff. But this system directed her first to Telford, almost 100 miles away, and then to London, a distance of more than 200 miles. No home kits were available. ""It was a complete nightmare,"" she said. ""I had to cancel face-to-face appointments with patients, including baby clinics."" Government apologises over Covid tests shortage How do I get a coronavirus test? She added that this had become a common theme in NHS Facebook groups of which she was a member. ""The whole system is going to fall over. ""It doesn't feel like the infrastructure is there to support NHS staff going into winter."" This sentiment was echoed by a psychiatrist in an area currently subject to government intervention because of its high rate of coronavirus. She found that no tests were available after developing all of the textbook coronavirus symptoms, including a cough and a fever. Frances, in Suffolk, tried to apply for a test when her daughter developed a high temperature. She didn't think it was coronavirus but ""the rules are the rules"". She had understood that anyone with a temperature should apply for a test, and was not able to send either of her children to school until she did. ""Their teachers need to be kept safe, their classmates need to be kept safe, we need to do the right thing,"" she said. Frances, like Melissa, was also not able to get a home kit, and when she tried to get an appointment at a drive-through centre was told no test sites were found. ""It almost looks like a glitch in the system,"" she said. Jamie in Chesterfield spent seven hours trying to contact someone using the 119 number after no slots were appearing on the online booking system. His school-age child had developed a new cough. ""It's the right thing to do according to the guidelines,"" he said. Eventually he managed to get a test 50 miles away. Meanwhile in Wales, the leader of Rhondda Cynon Taff council, which is struggling to avoid a local lockdown, said he was ""furious"" about the limited testing capacity. Andrew Morgan said a ""huge effort"" had to be made after learning that mobile testing units in Wales were to be limited to only 60 tests. It comes as a number of different data sources showcases are rising and the epidemic is growingfor the first time since before lockdown. On Saturday, the number of new daily confirmed UK cases of the virus rose to 3,497 - the second day running it has been above 3,000. The virus is still at much lower levels across the UK than at the peak in April, but a study of thousands of people in England found cases doubling every seven to eight days, with a marked rise in infections in the north and among young people. Although cases are rising, the number of patients in hospital remains largely flat at 863. ENDGAME:When will life get back to normal? EASY STEPS:What can I do? A SIMPLE GUIDE:What are the symptoms? MAPS AND CHARTS:Visual guide to the outbreak VIDEO:The 20-second hand wash There are some suggestions that the problems with accessing tests have happened since schools have returned. Mr Hancock has claimed 25% of people applying for tests are not eligible because they don't have symptoms, although his department did not say where this figure came from. Meanwhile, NHS 111 data published on 11 September reported a rise in calls relating to children with symptoms that would make them eligible for a coronavirus test.

Scotland's daily Covid cases hit four-month highThere were 221 confirmed cases in the last 24 hours in Scotland - but there were no Covid deaths.,"Daily coronavirus cases in Scotland have hit a four-month high, the latest Scottish government statistics show. A total of 221 people tested positive for the virus in the past 24 hours - the highest daily figure since 8 May, when there were 225 positive tests. However there were far fewer tests being carried out at that stage of the pandemic, meaning many people with the virus did not appear in the statistics. The latest figures,externalalso show there were no more confirmed Covid deaths. They also reveal: 18,240 tests were carried out (compared to 4,732 on 8 May) Eight people were in intensive care with Covid-19 261 people were in hospital with a confirmed case of the virus It comes astougher coronavirus restrictions are imposed on people in North and South Lanarkshire. They are not allowed to meet other households in their homes, or visit other peoples' homes. Similar measures are already in place in Glasgow, East and West Dunbartonshire, Renfrewshire and East Renfrewshire. The daily statistics also show that 106 of the positive tests were recorded in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board area. In the NHS Lanarkshire area there were 48 new cases, and there were 35 in Lothian. There was at least one positive case in each of the mainland health board areas. On Twitter,,externalthe first minister urged people to follow public health advice. ""More than ever we must remember that what we do as individuals just now affects the wellbeing of everyone. Let's look after each other,"" she added. And Prof Jason Leitch, Scotland's national clinical director, admitted that 221 positive cases was a ""big number compared to what we have got used to"". ""As we've opened up it's inevitable the virus has found new ways of getting from household to household - and that's all it wants to do; it wants to find new people to infect,"" he told BBC Scotland. ""You've seen us take fairly harsh interventions and restrictions to some areas - that won't work instantly. It will need days, weeks, even a number of weeks, to show in the numbers. ""It's not good news, but it's what we expected. The virus doesn't work in 24 hour cycles - it works in two to three week cycles."" Prof Leitch acknowledged that many people may be starting to feel ""lockdown fatigue"" more than six months into the crisis. But we can't ""simply wish [coronavirus] away"", he added. The increase in cases in recent weeks has led to a change in the rules when it comes to groups meeting.

"Confidence vote in Scottish Labour leader withdrawnSeveral MSPs had called on Richard Leonard to quit, warning the party faced ""disaster"" at the Holyrood election.Scotland politics","A motion of no confidence in the Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has been withdrawn. Mr Leonard had been expected to face a vote at a meeting of the party's governing body on Saturday. The motion was submitted afterfour Labour MSPs called for his resignation last week, citing poor election results and polling under his command. Speaking after the meeting, Mr Leonard said it was time to end ""internal plotting"". And he called for ""unity not division"" within the party. ""It's time for Scottish Labour to stand together and to stand with the Scottish people at a time when risks caused by pandemic are rising again and when the economy is on the edge of a deep recession with jobs and livelihoods in peril,"" he said. ""There must be an end to the internal plotting and we must unite to hold the Scottish government to account and to offer a real alternative. ""I firmly believe that I am the best person to lead us into next year's elections with a plan for jobs and real economic and social transformation which I know is shared by Keir Starmer. ""I have listened to the concerns expressed about me, I will treat those with respect and humility, and I will fight with every ounce of my being to improve the fortunes of the party in the run up to next year's election."" Richard Leonard: Who is the Scottish Labour leader? The motion was withdrawn after being discussed at the the party's Scottish Executive Committee (SEC). The committee is made up of elected representatives as well as trade union officials and representatives of the party's grassroots membership. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard was a close ally of former UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn Mr Leonard, who was a close ally of former UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, still enjoys the support of many on the left of the party. But his critics point to the party's dismal opinion poll ratings as proof that change is needed. Opinion polls suggest Scottish Labour is trailing a distant third behind the SNP and Scottish Conservatives ahead of the election next May. Scottish Labour is currently the third largest in the Scottish Parliament, behind the SNP and Conservatives, and lost all but one of its MPs in last year's general election.

Specialist Border Force officers were called in to conduct detailed searches of the HGVs In one, a complex concealment was located, which once opened was found to contain about 21 kilos of cocaine. At the same time officers from the NCA and PSNI time carried out searches at a number of properties in Northern Ireland. The investigation has also been supported throughout by An Garda SÃ­ochÃ¡na (Irish police) and the Organised Crime Task Force. NCA Regional Head of Investigations Gerry McLean said the seizures ""prevented a large quantity of drugs from reaching our streets, and denied criminals an important avenue for smuggling."" ""This is a highly significant operation in terms of our activity to target organised crime impacting on Northern Ireland,"" he added. He thanked colleagues from the PSNI, Garda and Border Force. A wrapped package of drugs discovered in searches Det Supt Rachel Shields, from the PSNI, said detectives had been working in collaboration with the NCA in relation to this operation for some time. ""These arrests and seizure are significant in terms of the quantity seized, and in terms of the disruption caused to organised criminals,"" she said. ""We will continue to work closely with, and support the NCA in their work to disrupt the nefarious activities of organised crime groups,"" she added 'Like an atomic bomb': Los Angeles fire chiefs warn death toll is likely to rise What's the latest on the LA fires, and what caused them?

Woman arrested over 300-strong silent disco,"Police urged people to let them know about any planned, unlicensed events A woman has been arrested after more than 300 people attended a silent disco in an industrial unit. The unlicensed music event took place at Twyford Industrial Estate in Bishop's Stortford, Hertfordshire, on 30 August. Police had been made aware a small gathering for a wedding party with social distancing would be held. A 50-year-old woman was arrested in London on suspicion of money laundering and breaking licensing rules. Ch Insp Stuart Orton said: ""In the current climate with Covid circulating ever more virulently in the community, and the latest legislative changes regarding the permitted size of gatherings, it is imperative that the public abide by social distancing regulations. ""Breaches will be dealt with robustly and to the full extent of the law."" He said police were made aware of a gathering at the unit but were told it would be a small gathering for a wedding party and that social distancing measures would be in place. Coronavirus in England: England's coronavirus hotspots in maps Government office failed to enforce distancing  A closure order was granted, banning anyone from entering the industrial unit for three months. Hertfordshire Police was seeking to freeze funds believed to have been made from the event, which it said included a specialised sound system and the unlawful sale of alcohol.

Afghan-Taliban talks a rare 'opportunity for peace',"Abdullah Abdullah (centre), head of the Afghan government's delegation, called for a humanitarian ceasefire The first-ever peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban are under way in the Gulf state of Qatar. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the talks a ""truly momentous"" breakthrough, while the head of Afghanistan's peace council called it an ""exceptional opportunity for peace"". The Taliban did not mention a truce, reiterating instead that Afghanistan should be under Islamic law. These talks follow a US-Taliban security deal reached in February. Afghanistan has seen four decades of conflict, with tens of thousands of civilians killed. These are the first direct talks between the Taliban and representatives of the Afghan government. The militants had until now refused to meet the government, calling them powerless and American ""puppets"". The two sides are aiming for political reconciliation and an end to decades of violence, which began with the 1979 Soviet invasion. Three generations after a bomb blast in Balkh province - many Afghans have never known peace US-led troops have been present in Afghanistan for nearly two decades, after launching air strikes to oust the Taliban in 2001 following the deadly 9/11 al-Qaeda attacks in New York. At 19 years, the conflict in Afghanistan has been the longest in US history. One senior Afghan negotiator, Nader Nadery, told the BBC it was ""an emotional, but very very difficult and important day."" ""All of us have lost loved ones and the country that we love so much has been destroyed... it's also difficult because you face the people who, as an example in my case, killed my nephew two weeks ago. And we need to pull all the strength to face them, to talk to them."" Everyone taking part in the talks has acknowledged that they will be challenging - there are deep disagreements between the two sides, and the conflict is still continuing in Afghanistan. A Taliban spokesman told the BBC it was ""good progress"" that both sides were talking rather than fighting Mr Pompeo, who spoke at the opening of the talks, said there would ""undoubtedly"" be ""many challenges"" - but stressed that a peace deal would benefit future generations, and also affect how much aid the US provided in the years to follow. Abdullah Abdullah, the head of Afghanistan's delegation, said the two sides ""do not have to agree 100% on each of the issues before us"", but said he hoped for a humanitarian ceasefire and a peace ""accepted and supported by all Afghan citizens"". At the conference Taliban leader Mullah Baradar Akhund called for Afghanistan to have an ""Islamic system in which all tribes and ethnicities... live their lives in love and brotherhood"". ""Negotiations may have problems but should move forward with patience,"" he added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Many worry that fragile progress made in women's rights could be sacrificed,externalin the process, with one women's rights activist pointing out that ""there is not a single woman"" in the Taliban's negotiating team. The talks also present a challenge to the Taliban, who will have to bring forward a tangible political vision for Afghanistan. They have so far been vague, stating they wish to see an ""Islamic"" but also ""inclusive"" government. The talks may provide more evidence of how the militant group has changed since the 1990s, when they ruled using a harsh interpretation of Sharia law. In a statement, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said ""sacrifices"" from ""Afghans and our own troops"" had helped improve the quality of life for people in the country, particularly for women. ""These sacrifices were not made in vain,"" he said. ""The talks starting today must preserve these gains to reflect the hopes and wishes of all Afghan men and women."" He added that the alliance was ""adjusting [its] troop presence"" in the country in support of the peace process. Emotional, nervous, cautiously hopeful, worried - just some of the words spoken by Afghans to express their feelings in this moment. In a country where turning points of the past have veered into yet more violence, everyone speaks of a profound yearning for peace. But everyone knows too of the hurdles ahead. After the opening speeches, a Taliban leader remarked: ""Isn't it better to talk together than to fight each other?"" An Afghan diplomat was at pains to point out that everyone who spoke in the opening ceremony called for a ceasefire - except the Taliban. But an Afghan politician noted, positively, Taliban leader Mullah Baradar's statement where he mentioned the difficulties, but also the readiness to resolve them. The words that matter most will come when Afghans sit down for their first formal face-to-face talks. What matters just as much is what happens on the battlefield still burning back home. The US-Taliban agreement reached in February set out a timetable for the withdrawal of foreign forces, in exchange for counter-terrorism guarantees. The US and its Nato allies agreed to withdraw all troops within 14 months, while the Taliban committed not to allow al-Qaeda or any other extremist group to operate in the areas they control. The US also agreed to lift sanctions against the Taliban and work with the UN to lift its separate sanctions against the group, as well as cutting its troop numbers in the country from about 12,000 to 8,600 and closing several bases. The deal also provided for a prisoner swap of about 5,000 Taliban prisoners and 1,000 detained Afghan security personnel. Taliban prisoners preparing to leave a government prison in Kabul in August Talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban were meant to begin in March but were repeatedly delayed by a dispute over prisoner exchange arrangements, as well as violence in the country. Some of the men the Taliban wanted freed were commanders believed to have been involved in major attacks. ""We cannot release the killers of our people,"" a government negotiator said at the time. According to a report by the Washington Post last month, three Afghans accused of involvement in the deaths of US troops were also a sticking point. Taliban peace talks: What to expect The Afghan war: The short and long story Who are the Taliban? Progress was slow, but in August the Afghan government began to free the final 400 Taliban prisoners, after the move wasapproved by a grand assembly, or loya jirgaof elders. Not all of the group of 400 were released straight away, after both France and Australia objected to freeing six prisoners accused of fatal attacks against their nationals, including humanitarian workers. Their release and transfer to Doha on the eve of talks removed the final hurdle. US-led troops have been present in Afghanistan for nearly two decades, after launching air strikes to oust the Taliban in 2001 following the deadly 9/11 al-Qaeda attacks in New York. The Taliban, who protected al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, had refused to hand him over. Women in the crosshairs as Afghanistan eyes peace The Afghan women determined not to lose out 'They tried to kill my mother in front of me, twice' At the outset in 2001, the US was joined in its fight by an international coalition, and the Taliban were quickly removed from power. But the militant group morphed into an insurgent force that dug in and launched deadly attacks against US-led forces and the Afghan military, as well as Afghan government officials. This video can not be played Is peace with the Taliban possible? The international coalition ended its combat mission in 2014. The total coalition death toll by that point was nearly 3,500. More than 2,400 US military personnel have been killed. The UK lost more than 450 of its soldiers. The Watson Institute at Brown University estimated in November 2019,externalthat more than 43,000 civilians had been killed, with 64,000 Afghan security personnel and 42,000 anti-government fighters dead. The true numbers will never be known. The US continued its own, scaled-back combat operation after 2014, including air strikes.

Migrants tear gassed in Greek camp protestMigrants and refugees were made homeless when the camp on the Greek island of Lesbos burned down.,"This video can not be played Thousands of migrants and refugees are demanding more permanent housing elsewhere Police on the Greek island of Lesbos fired tear gas at protesting migrants who were left homeless when their camp burned down on Wednesday. Around 13,000 migrants and refugees had been living in squalor in the overcrowded Moria camp, and are desperate to leave the island. The clashes broke out near a temporary camp built by Greek authorities. A fire was set there earlier in the day, near a police blockade, and had to be extinguished by firefighters. A new camp, Kara Tepe, has now been set up. Police said about 200 people had checked in at the new camp, while dozens - mostly families - queued outside, waiting for hygiene and safety checks. This video can not be played Migrants and refugees arrive at a new tent camp in Lesbos Families have been sleeping in fields and on roads after fleeing the blaze on Wednesday. The Moria camp was initially designed to house 3,000 migrants. People from 70 countries had been sheltered there, most from Afghanistan. â¢'Europe does not exist. This is hell' - migrants on Lesbos: How the migrant crisis changed Europe Med's deadly migrant crisis: In maps and charts On Friday, migrants and refugees approached police barriers blocking the road out of Moria camp, holding signs calling for ""freedom"" and opposing the construction of a new camp. There is also strong resistance from the island's permanent residents for a new camp, and they have been blocking roads to stop aid deliveries. Riot police fired tear gas on Saturday The question of how to deal with the mass arrivals of migrants, mainly to Italy and Greece, has divided the EU for years. Italy and Greece have accused wealthier northern countries of failing to do more, while a number of central and eastern nations are openly resistant to the idea of taking in a quota of migrants. The new camp will begin hosting some of those left without shelter from Saturday, Greece's Migration Minister Notis Mitarachi said. On Friday, Germany announced that 10 European countries had agreed to take 400 unaccompanied minors who had been living in Moria. The fire at Moria was ""a sharp reminder to all of us for what we need to change in Europe"", Germany's Interior Minister Horst Seehofer said. But a group of charities and NGOs have written to the German government saying more has to be done for all of the migrants, not just those minors. This video can not be played Migrants are struggling to cope out in the open ""The shameful situation in the camp and the fire disaster are the direct result of a failed European refugee policy - now the EU must finally help the people affected,""the open letter reads,external. Fires broke out in more than three places overnight on Tuesday, according to local fire chief Konstantinos Theofilopoulos. Further fires left the camp almost completely destroyed.

Some of those infected with the virus had reportedly refused to move into isolation with their families. He did not say, however, that the fires were a deliberate act of arson aimed at destroying the camp.

""You've only got to look across the Channel to see what is happening in France and what's happening in Spain."" Prof Walport said it was very important that children go to school and students return to university - but social interactions would have to be limited in other areas. ""The only way to stop the spread of this infection is to reduce the number of people we all come into contact with,"" he added. UK coronavirus cases up by 3,539 on Friday What are the new rules for meeting my friends? R number above 1 as coronavirus cases rise Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said the rule of six was ""well-understood"" as a public health message and had the public's support. ""As ever, the important thing is balance - eating out, seeing friends - that is fine, provided we do so in a way that is socially responsible, that's what the rule of six is about."" He said some people had ""unwittingly"" contributed to the spread of the virus because of the way they had interacted, adding: ""So therefore, a clear message - as simple as possible - makes it easier for all of us to do what is helpful to others."" Speaking on Radio 4, he added that there needed to be ""a degree of self-discipline and restriction"" in order to deal with the challenges posed by the rising number of coronavirus cases across England -and the escalating R number, which measures the rate at which the virus is transmitted. Speaking on BBC Breakfast. he urged the public to behave in ""a responsible fashion"" amid fears people might treat it as a ""party weekend"", ahead of the new restrictions coming into effect next week. ""These rules and regulations are there for our protection, but also for the protection of the most vulnerable in society"", citing the elderly or those with underlying health conditions ""who face far grimmer consequences"" if they contract Covid-19. ""The onus is on all of us to do everything we can to make sure we abide by those rules. ""Then we can ensure, in due course, that these restrictions can be relaxed - and my hope, like so many, is that we can have a proper Christmas."" This video can not be played What is the R number and what does it mean? In the immediate future, Mr Gove agreed fines could be necessary to enforce regulations. Itfollows a story in the Times,external, which says the government is looking at introducing fines for people who refuse to self-isolate when required. ""I don't want to see fines being levied, but even more I do not want to see people behaving in a way that puts the most vulnerable at risk,"" Mr Gove told Radio 4. Asked about Prof Walport's statement that the UK was ""losing control"", Mr Gove said it was ""a warning to us all"". ""There's a range of scientific opinion, but one thing on which practically every scientist is agreed is that we have seen an uptick in infection and therefore it is appropriate we take public health measures."" There are fears people will treat this weekend as a ""party weekend"" ahead of the new restrictions Sage found that only about 20% of people who have symptoms or live in a household where someone else has symptoms adhere to self-isolation requirements. ""Sometimes there's an argument that's depicted, as though this is pernicious of the liberty of freedom-loving people - well there are restrictions, and I love freedom, but the one thing I think is even more important is that you exercise freedom with responsibility,"" said Mr Gove. Some Conservative backbenchers have protested about enhanced regulations, such as the rule of six, and pressed the government to follow Wales and Scotland in exempting young children. On Friday,ex-minister Steve Baker said the latest government action amounted to ""arbitrary powers without scrutiny""and MP Desmond Swayne said it was ""outrageous"" not to have a Parliamentary debate. ""This is not a fit legal environment for the British people,"" Mr Baker told the BBC. ""It's time to move to a voluntary system, unless the government can demonstrate otherwise and it is time for us to start living like a free people."" Senior Conservative backbenchers are reported to be lobbying Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle to make sure that legislation is being reviewed every month, not every six months.

Confidence vote in Scottish Labour leader withdrawn,"A motion of no confidence in the Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard has been withdrawn. Mr Leonard had been expected to face a vote at a meeting of the party's governing body on Saturday. The motion was submitted afterfour Labour MSPs called for his resignation last week, citing poor election results and polling under his command. Speaking after the meeting, Mr Leonard said it was time to end ""internal plotting"". And he called for ""unity not division"" within the party. ""It's time for Scottish Labour to stand together and to stand with the Scottish people at a time when risks caused by pandemic are rising again and when the economy is on the edge of a deep recession with jobs and livelihoods in peril,"" he said. ""There must be an end to the internal plotting and we must unite to hold the Scottish government to account and to offer a real alternative. ""I firmly believe that I am the best person to lead us into next year's elections with a plan for jobs and real economic and social transformation which I know is shared by Keir Starmer. ""I have listened to the concerns expressed about me, I will treat those with respect and humility, and I will fight with every ounce of my being to improve the fortunes of the party in the run up to next year's election."" Richard Leonard: Who is the Scottish Labour leader? The motion was withdrawn after being discussed at the the party's Scottish Executive Committee (SEC). The committee is made up of elected representatives as well as trade union officials and representatives of the party's grassroots membership. Scottish Labour leader Richard Leonard was a close ally of former UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn Mr Leonard, who was a close ally of former UK Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn, still enjoys the support of many on the left of the party. But his critics point to the party's dismal opinion poll ratings as proof that change is needed. Opinion polls suggest Scottish Labour is trailing a distant third behind the SNP and Scottish Conservatives ahead of the election next May. Scottish Labour is currently the third largest in the Scottish Parliament, behind the SNP and Conservatives, and lost all but one of its MPs in last year's general election.

What does R value above one mean?,"The rate at which coronavirus infection is falling in the UK - as measured by the R number - has continued to level off. The latest R estimate from the government's scientific advisory group Sage,is between 0.7 and 0.9,external, up slightly from the week before. It means that, on average, every 10 people with Covid will infect between seven and nine other people. The R number is a way of rating coronavirus or any disease's ability to spread. R is the number of people that one infected person will pass on a virus to, on average. Measles has an R number of 15 in populations without immunity. That means, on average, one person will spread measles to 15 others. Coronavirus - known officially as Sars-CoV-2 - would have a reproduction number of about three if no action was taken to stop it spreading. You can't capture the moment people are infected. Instead, scientists work backwards. Data - such as the number of people dying, admitted to hospital or testing positive for the virus over time - is used to estimate how easily the virus is spreading. If the R value is higher than one, then the number of cases keeps increasing. But if the R number is lower the disease will eventually stop spreading, because not enough new people are being infected to sustain the outbreak. If the R-value is above one then the number of cumulative cases takes off, but if it is below one then eventually the outbreak stops. The further below one, the faster that happens. Governments everywhere want to force the R number down from about three (the R number if we took no action) to below one. The R number is not fixed. Instead, it changes as our behaviour changes or as immunity develops. Mathematical modellers at Imperial College London attempted to track how the number changed as isolation, social distancing and the full lockdown were introduced in spring of 2020. Before any measures came in, the R number was well above one and the conditions were ripe for a large outbreak. Successive restrictions brought it down, but it was not until full lockdown that it was driven below one. Although the R number across the UK is now between 0.7 and 0.9, there are regional differences. Scotland'sestimated R number isbetween 0.8 and 1.0,external, up slightly on the previous week. InWalesthe number isbetween 0.6 and 0.9,external- while inNorthern Irelandit remains between 0.75 and 0.95. InEngland, the number is risen slightly to between 0.8 and 1.0. What are the latest social distancing rules? How many confirmed cases are there in your area? Vaccine passports could discriminate, experts warn TheR numberis one of the big three. Another isseverity- some people have a very mild disease that does not cause many problems. But coronavirus and the disease it causes, Covid-19, can be severe and deadly. The last is thenumber of cases, which is important for deciding when to act. If you have a high number, but ease restrictions so the reproduction number is about one, then you will continue to have a high number of cases. A vaccination programme, like the onecurrently under way in the UK, is another way to bring down the reproduction number. A coronavirus patient would naturally infect three others on average, but if a vaccine could protect two of them from infection, then the reproduction number would fall from three to one.

The rise in Covid cases in charts,"The government says there is ""high demand"" for coronavirus tests Officials are alarmed by the latest rise in coronavirus cases. Newly diagnosed cases have topped 2,000 for the past three days. The average rate of new infections is now four times higher than it was in mid-July. The rise is real, but is it quite as sharp as it looks? Here are five things to consider. The confirmed cases chart is one we have all got used to. It shows the number of positive Covid-19 tests a day. In April, there were days when 6,000 new cases a day were recorded, so the level of infections in the past few days appears to be some way towards that peak. But at the start of the pandemic, the UK was only largely able to test hospital patients. There was limited testing capacity. This targeted testing meant infections in the community were completely missed, whereas now we have mass testing in the community. It means that if we compare numbers now to numbers during the peak, we are essentially comparing apples with pears. Estimates from the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine suggest there may have been as many as 100,000 cases a day at the end of March. Mass testing in the community only started in the second half of May. Clearly not all cases are now being picked up, although the surveillance programme run by the Office for National Statistics suggests a large proportion are, whereas earlier in the pandemic maybe only 5% of cases were being detected. So while cases may be rising, the level of infection being seen is still very low compared with the peak. Even after mass testing was launched, the number of tests carried out on a daily and weekly basis has still been increasing. This is because more testing centres have opened and lab capacity to process the tests has increased. It means we are able to look more closely for virus circulating in the community than we were when mass testing first started. If you look at the trend solely in terms of positive cases, the pattern looks like this: But we have to factor in that big increase in testing - there has been an 80% rise since mid-June. When you adjust for the numbers of tests carried out and calculate the percentage of positive tests, the trend looks more like this: The rise seems to be smaller, slower and to have happened more recently. How do I get a coronavirus test? Cases are rising, what should I do? What is the R number and how is it calculated? The increase in testing capacity means the government now has a flexible army of testing facilities. A network of more than 100 mobile units can be dispatched around the country. And despite the current problems with lab capacity, which have meant some people in some places have struggled to get a test, resources are still being focused on areas with the highest rates. Random testing in neighbourhoods has also started in hotspot areas, with people offered tests even if they don't have symptoms. By looking in areas with highest rates of infection, you are more likely to get positive tests. It is telling that over the past week to Sunday, a quarter of new cases were in the 20 local authority areas with the highest rates. They represent just 5% of total local authorities. Over the past few days hospital admissions have started to slowly tick up - though not as much as cases, and it's too soon to know if this is statistically significant. They are a small fraction of the number of admissions back in March, and they are rising much more gradually than they were around the peak. One theory is that more testing is uncovering a larger number of mild cases which don't need treatment. Another is that more of the cases are among younger people, who are less likely to become very ill. But the rise suggests the virus could be taking hold in the community again, and could quickly escalate. Public Health England data shows people in the 20-39 age bracket are testing positive at higher rates than any other age group, and at higher rates than they were earlier in the pandemic. What's harder to say is why that is. It could be behavioural or demographic - that younger people are more likely to have to go out to work, have public facing jobs, live in shared housing and go out to socialise. But it could also be a function of how eligibility for testing has expanded. Younger age groups are much less likely to get seriously sick with coronavirus, and so earlier this year would not have found themselves in hospital where they would have been tested.

UK 'must avoid party weekend' ahead of new rules,"People in the UK must not treat this weekend as a ""party"" before the new ""rule of six"" coronavirus restrictions come into force on Monday, a police union has warned. The Police Federation said there was a ""real risk"" that the public would ""take advantage of the current situation"". The new rules limit gatherings to six people indoors and outdoors in England. It comes as one scientist warned the UK was ""on the edge of losing control"" of the virus. England's new rule of six applies to all ages, although there are some exemptions, such as gatherings for work. Those who fail to follow the new rules can be fined by police - Â£100 for a first offence, doubling on each further offence up to Â£3,200. In Scotland, socialising will be limited to a maximum of six people inside and outside - but unlike England they must be from two households, and children under 12 are exempt. In Wales, also from Monday,it will be illegalfor more than six people from an extended household to meet indoors - but up to 30 can still meet outdoors. In Northern Ireland last month, meanwhile, the number of people who could gather indoors in a private home was reduced from 10 people from four households to six people from two households. With the introduction of the new rules in England and Wales delayed until Monday, John Apter, the chairman of the Police Federation for England and Wales, said: ""There is a real risk some members of the public will take advantage of the current situation and treat this weekend as a party weekend ahead of the tighter restrictions being introduced on Monday. ""Using the current situation as an opportunity and excuse to party would be incredibly irresponsible and put pressure not only on policing, but potentially on the ambulance service and NHS."" What are the new rules for meeting my friends? How many cases are there in your area?  Tim Robson, the North East's representative on the National Pubwatch scheme, said he expected police officers would strictly monitor bars over the weekend to ensure they are operating safely. ""There is an anticipation that everyone is going to have a big last binge, but people are starting to get fearful and a lot of licensed premises have already been clamped down on by the police,"" he said. Mr Robson, a former police officer, said it would be up to licensees to manage their premises and break up large groups from gathering together unsafely. This video can not be played ""If the restrictions are urgent why are they waiting until Monday? Why aren't they coming in now?"" On Saturday, the government announced there were a further 3,497 coronavirus cases in the UK. In Scotland, daily coronavirus cases have hit a four-month high, with a total of 221 people testing positive for the virus in the past 24 hours - the highest daily figure since May 8. The virus is still at much lower levels across the UK than at the peak in April, but a study of thousands of people in England found cases are doubling every seven to eight days. Prof Sir Mark Walport, a member of the government's Sage scientific advisory group, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""One would have to say that we're on the edge of losing control. ""You've only got to look across the Channel to see what is happening in France and what's happening in Spain."" It comes as the final clinical trials for a vaccine, developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University,are set to resume. They wereput on hold last weekendafter a participant became unwell. The AstraZeneca-Oxford University vaccine - in which 18,000 people from around the world are taking part - is seen as a strong contender among dozens being developed globally. Meanwhile, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said the rule of six was ""well-understood"" as a public health message and had the public's support. ""As ever, the important thing is balance - eating out, seeing friends - that is fine, provided we do so in a way that is socially responsible, that's what the rule of six is about,"" he told the BBC. He added that there needed to be ""a degree of self-discipline and restriction"" in order to deal with the challenges posed by the rising number of coronavirus cases across England - and theescalating R number, which measures the rate at which the virus is transmitted. However, Mr Gove also conceded fines could be necessary to enforce regulations. ""I don't want to see fines being levied, but even more I do not want to see people behaving in a way that puts the most vulnerable at risk,"" he said. Behind the rise in Covid cases in five charts How close to developing a vaccine are we? The R number has been raised to between 1 and 1.2 for the first time since March. Any number above one indicates the number of infections is increasing. And in addition to a general rise in cases in the community, the government'slatest coronavirus surveillance report,externalshows a sharp rise in people over the age of 85 testing positive. Asked about Prof Walport's statement that the UK was ""losing control"", Mr Gove said it was ""a warning to us all"".

Daily coronavirus cases hit four month high,"Daily coronavirus cases in Scotland have hit a four-month high, the latest Scottish government statistics show. A total of 221 people tested positive for the virus in the past 24 hours - the highest daily figure since 8 May, when there were 225 positive tests. However there were far fewer tests being carried out at that stage of the pandemic, meaning many people with the virus did not appear in the statistics. The latest figures,externalalso show there were no more confirmed Covid deaths. They also reveal: 18,240 tests were carried out (compared to 4,732 on 8 May) Eight people were in intensive care with Covid-19 261 people were in hospital with a confirmed case of the virus It comes astougher coronavirus restrictions are imposed on people in North and South Lanarkshire. They are not allowed to meet other households in their homes, or visit other peoples' homes. Similar measures are already in place in Glasgow, East and West Dunbartonshire, Renfrewshire and East Renfrewshire. The daily statistics also show that 106 of the positive tests were recorded in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board area. In the NHS Lanarkshire area there were 48 new cases, and there were 35 in Lothian. There was at least one positive case in each of the mainland health board areas. On Twitter,,externalthe first minister urged people to follow public health advice. ""More than ever we must remember that what we do as individuals just now affects the wellbeing of everyone. Let's look after each other,"" she added. And Prof Jason Leitch, Scotland's national clinical director, admitted that 221 positive cases was a ""big number compared to what we have got used to"". ""As we've opened up it's inevitable the virus has found new ways of getting from household to household - and that's all it wants to do; it wants to find new people to infect,"" he told BBC Scotland. ""You've seen us take fairly harsh interventions and restrictions to some areas - that won't work instantly. It will need days, weeks, even a number of weeks, to show in the numbers. ""It's not good news, but it's what we expected. The virus doesn't work in 24 hour cycles - it works in two to three week cycles."" Prof Leitch acknowledged that many people may be starting to feel ""lockdown fatigue"" more than six months into the crisis. But we can't ""simply wish [coronavirus] away"", he added. The increase in cases in recent weeks has led to a change in the rules when it comes to groups meeting. Until now, eight people from three households had been allowed to meet indoors in Scotland, and up to 15 from five households outdoors. But from Monday,this will changeto six people from two households and willapply both indoors and outdoors in Scotland,external- including in homes, gardens, pubs and restaurants. On Saturday,Scotland's contact tracing app, Protect Scotland, had been downloaded 800,000 times. The app, which was launched earlier in the week, uses Bluetooth technology to alert users if they have been in prolonged close contact with someone who has since tested positive for Covid-19. An Oxford University study claimed that even with an uptake of just 15%, a contact tracing app can drive down infections by about 8% and deaths by about 6% - if it is part of a manual track and trace strategy. Nicola Sturgeon said,externalit was a ""big milestone"", adding that it amounted to approximately 20% of the adult population. ""We know it will make a difference at that level"". she said, ""but the more who use it, the bigger that difference will be"". She urged Scots to encourage their friends and family members todownload the app,external. IMPACT:How is the pandemic affecting life in Scotland? CASES:Where are the latest cases in Scotland?

"Children will stay part of rule of six, says GoveThe new restrictions on gatherings have public support, the Cabinet Office minister insists.UK","Children are included in the new limits for social gatherings in England The ""rule of six"", the latest limits on social gatherings in England, will not be changed to exempt children under 12, Michael Gove has insisted. The new rules, which limit six people to meeting indoors and outdoors, come into effect on Monday. Similar rules in Wales and Scotland do not include children under 11 and 12 respectively. But Mr Gove said the England rules were ""absolutely right"". It comes as one scientist warned UK could lose control of the virus. ""One would have to say that we're on the edge of losing control,"" Prof Sir Mark Walport, a member of the government's Sage scientific advisory group told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""You've only got to look across the Channel to see what is happening in France and what's happening in Spain."" Prof Walport said it was very important that children go to school and students return to university - but social interactions would have to be limited in other areas. ""The only way to stop the spread of this infection is to reduce the number of people we all come into contact with,"" he added. UK coronavirus cases up by 3,539 on Friday What are the new rules for meeting my friends? R number above 1 as coronavirus cases rise Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said the rule of six was ""well-understood"" as a public health message and had the public's support. ""As ever, the important thing is balance - eating out, seeing friends - that is fine, provided we do so in a way that is socially responsible, that's what the rule of six is about."" He said some people had ""unwittingly"" contributed to the spread of the virus because of the way they had interacted, adding: ""So therefore, a clear message - as simple as possible - makes it easier for all of us to do what is helpful to others."" Speaking on Radio 4, he added that there needed to be ""a degree of self-discipline and restriction"" in order to deal with the challenges posed by the rising number of coronavirus cases across England -and the escalating R number, which measures the rate at which the virus is transmitted. Speaking on BBC Breakfast. he urged the public to behave in ""a responsible fashion"" amid fears people might treat it as a ""party weekend"", ahead of the new restrictions coming into effect next week. ""These rules and regulations are there for our protection, but also for the protection of the most vulnerable in society"", citing the elderly or those with underlying health conditions ""who face far grimmer consequences"" if they contract Covid-19. ""The onus is on all of us to do everything we can to make sure we abide by those rules. ""Then we can ensure, in due course, that these restrictions can be relaxed - and my hope, like so many, is that we can have a proper Christmas."" This video can not be played What is the R number and what does it mean? In the immediate future, Mr Gove agreed fines could be necessary to enforce regulations. Itfollows a story in the Times,external, which says the government is looking at introducing fines for people who refuse to self-isolate when required. ""I don't want to see fines being levied, but even more I do not want to see people behaving in a way that puts the most vulnerable at risk,"" Mr Gove told Radio 4. Asked about Prof Walport's statement that the UK was ""losing control"", Mr Gove said it was ""a warning to us all"". ""There's a range of scientific opinion, but one thing on which practically every scientist is agreed is that we have seen an uptick in infection and therefore it is appropriate we take public health measures."" There are fears people will treat this weekend as a ""party weekend"" ahead of the new restrictions Sage found that only about 20% of people who have symptoms or live in a household where someone else has symptoms adhere to self-isolation requirements. ""Sometimes there's an argument that's depicted, as though this is pernicious of the liberty of freedom-loving people - well there are restrictions, and I love freedom, but the one thing I think is even more important is that you exercise freedom with responsibility,"" said Mr Gove. Some Conservative backbenchers have protested about enhanced regulations, such as the rule of six, and pressed the government to follow Wales and Scotland in exempting young children. On Friday,ex-minister Steve Baker said the latest government action amounted to ""arbitrary powers without scrutiny""and MP Desmond Swayne said it was ""outrageous"" not to have a Parliamentary debate. ""This is not a fit legal environment for the British people,"" Mr Baker told the BBC. ""It's time to move to a voluntary system, unless the government can demonstrate otherwise and it is time for us to start living like a free people."" Senior Conservative backbenchers are reported to be lobbying Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle to make sure that legislation is being reviewed every month, not every six months.

""Just come to the state of California. Observe it with your own eyes,"" he told reporters from a charred mountainside. Fires have been raging in California, Oregon and Washington for three weeks. Fanned by winds amid record heat, the blazes have burnt millions of acres, destroyed thousands of homes, and killed at least 25 people.

This video can not be played Five ways that show the scale of California's 2020 wildfires The North Complex Fire, which has been burning since 18 August, is among the deadliest in history. Ten bodies have been found so far and another 16 people are missing. California has seen at least 20 deaths in total from fires since 15 August. Tens of thousands of people are under evacuation orders as 14,800 firefighters continue to combat 28 major fires in the state. While natural factors such as strong winds have helped the spread of these massive fires, the underlying heating of the climate from human activities is making these conflagrations bigger and more explosive. Nine of the world's 10 warmest years on record have occurred since 2005, and the UN warned this week that the five years from 2016 until this year will very likely be the hottest such period yet recorded. Both Oregon and California have warmed by more than 1C since 1900. The sustained warmth has seen six of the 20 largest fires on record in California all occur this year. In Oregon, the spate of fires has burned nearly twice the average annual losses in just the past week. In California, a prolonged drought over the past decade has killed millions of trees, turning them into potent fuel for the fires. Mountain regions that are normally cooler and wetter have dried out more rapidly in the summer, adding to the potential fuel load. Climate scientists had forecast that western wildfires would grow in size, scale and impact - but their predictions are coming to fruition faster than expected. A really simple guide to climate change In Oregon, where firefighters are battling 16 large blazes, 40,000 people are under mandatory evacuation orders. The fires have killed four people but officials warn the death could be much higher. Governor Kate Brown on Friday implored householders to stay out of the fire zones despite reports of looting. ""Let me assure you that we have the Oregon National Guard and Oregon State Police monitoring the situation and preventing looting,"" she said.

She told her four children to close their eyes as they made their escape. ""Everything is gone. We have to start again from nothing, but we are alive,"" she told the news agency. At least one blaze in Oregon - the Almeda Fire, one of the most destructive in the state - is being treated as suspected arson.

"Brexit bill protects UK 'integrity', says ministerMichael Gove backs the PM over the Internal Market Bill as the EU ramps up opposition to it.UK Politics","This video can not be played Michael Gove: ""What we can't have... is the EU disrupting or putting at threat the integrity of the UK"" Michael Gove has defended plans to override parts of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement as a means of protecting the ""integrity"" of the UK. The Cabinet Office minister said the UK was being ""generous"" with the EU over the Brexit negotiations. The EU has threatened legal action over the Internal Market Bill, which ministers say will break international law in a ""specific and limited way"". PM Boris Johnson is urging Tory MPs to back it, after some raised concerns. Thebill,external, which will be formally debated in the House of Commons for the first time on Monday, addresses the Northern Ireland Protocol - the part of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement designed to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland. If this became law it would give UK ministers powers to modify or ""disapply"" rules relating to the movement of goods between Britain and Northern Ireland that will come into force from 1 January, if the UK and EU are unable to strike a trade deal. Analysis: Despite bitter Brexit row can deal still be done? UK signs first major post-Brexit trade deal Brexit to dominate week ahead in Parliament UK at odds with EU over approval for food exports Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis told the Commons the bill, which would go against the Withdrawal Agreement signed by the UK and EU, would ""break international law in a very specific and limited way"". But Mr Gove said the attorney general had said the proposal would be consistent with the rule of law - and that it was important to have an ""insurance policy"". He insisted the government was being ""proportionate and generous"" in its approach to the EU talks. Mr Gove said: ""These steps are a safety net, they're a long-stop in the event, which I don't believe will come about but we do need to be ready for, that the EU follow through on what some have said they might do which is, in effect, to separate Northern Ireland from the rest of the United Kingdom."" While admitting it was a ""crunch moment"", he insisted ""we have got the support of our own MPs"". The EU and UK have less than five weeks to agree a deal before Mr Johnson's 15 October deadline - after which he says he is prepared to ""walk away"". Informal talks are due to resume on Monday, with the next official round of talks - the ninth since March - starting in Brussels on 28 September. The EU says the planned changes must be scrappedor they risk jeopardising the UK-EU trade talksand  the European Parliament says will  ""under no circumstances ratify"" any trade deal reached between the UK and EU if the ""UK authorities breach or threaten to breach"" the Withdrawal Agreement. Boris Johnson said he would not countenance ""the threat of a border down the Irish Sea"" On Friday Mr Johnson had a Zoom call with about 250 of his MPs, in whichhe said the party could not return to ""miserable squabbling"" over Europe. Conservative backbencher Sir Bob Neill, who chairs the Commons Justice Committee, said he was not reassured by the prime minister's Zoom call. He is tabling an amendment to the bill to try to force a separate parliamentary vote on any changes to the Withdrawal Agreement. ""I believe it is potentially a harmful act for this country, it would damage our reputation and I think it will make it harder to strike trade deals going forward,"" he said. And on Saturday, Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood - who is chairman of the Defence Select Committee - also voiced his concern. ""I don't want us to lose our way, to lose our reputation as a force for good, as an exemplar holding up the international rule of law,"" he said. ""I'm afraid that's where I find myself not wishing to support this particular bill, because it does mean that we would be challenging unilaterally a Treaty. And that goes against the principle of everything we stand for."" Former Conservative party leaders Theresa May, Lord Howard and Sir John Major are also among senior figures urging Mr Johnson to think again. Both Ireland and the EU have warned that Mr Johnson's plans pose a serious risk to the peace process rather than protecting the Good Friday Agreement, as the government claims. Writing that it had become clear there might be a ""serious misunderstanding"" between the UK and EU over the Withdrawal Agreement, Mr Johnson said the UK must be protected from what he called a ""disaster"" of the EU being able to ""carve up our country"" and ""endanger peace and stability in Northern Ireland"". He said there was still a ""very good chance"" of the UK and EU striking a deal by mid-October similar to that previouslyagreed between the EU and Canada- which got rid of most, but not all, tariffs on goods. But in a column in the Daily Telegraph,external, he accused the EU of adopting an ""extreme"" interpretation of the Northern Ireland Protocol to impose ""a full-scale trade border down the Irish Sea"" that could stop the transport of food from Britain to Northern Ireland. Mr Gove told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it would be ""irrational"" not to allow the transportation of food in such a way, which would happen if the UK was not grantedthird-country listing. Such a listing is needed for the export of food.

Scotland's daily Covid cases hit four-month highThe latest statistics show there were 221 confirmed cases in the last 24 hours - but there were no Covid deaths.Scotland,"Daily coronavirus cases in Scotland have hit a four-month high, the latest Scottish government statistics show. A total of 221 people tested positive for the virus in the past 24 hours - the highest daily figure since 8 May, when there were 225 positive tests. However there were far fewer tests being carried out at that stage of the pandemic, meaning many people with the virus did not appear in the statistics. The latest figures,externalalso show there were no more confirmed Covid deaths. They also reveal: 18,240 tests were carried out (compared to 4,732 on 8 May) Eight people were in intensive care with Covid-19 261 people were in hospital with a confirmed case of the virus It comes astougher coronavirus restrictions are imposed on people in North and South Lanarkshire. They are not allowed to meet other households in their homes, or visit other peoples' homes. Similar measures are already in place in Glasgow, East and West Dunbartonshire, Renfrewshire and East Renfrewshire. The daily statistics also show that 106 of the positive tests were recorded in the Greater Glasgow and Clyde health board area. In the NHS Lanarkshire area there were 48 new cases, and there were 35 in Lothian. There was at least one positive case in each of the mainland health board areas. On Twitter,,externalthe first minister urged people to follow public health advice. ""More than ever we must remember that what we do as individuals just now affects the wellbeing of everyone. Let's look after each other,"" she added. And Prof Jason Leitch, Scotland's national clinical director, admitted that 221 positive cases was a ""big number compared to what we have got used to"". ""As we've opened up it's inevitable the virus has found new ways of getting from household to household - and that's all it wants to do; it wants to find new people to infect,"" he told BBC Scotland. ""You've seen us take fairly harsh interventions and restrictions to some areas - that won't work instantly. It will need days, weeks, even a number of weeks, to show in the numbers. ""It's not good news, but it's what we expected. The virus doesn't work in 24 hour cycles - it works in two to three week cycles."" Prof Leitch acknowledged that many people may be starting to feel ""lockdown fatigue"" more than six months into the crisis. But we can't ""simply wish [coronavirus] away"", he added. The increase in cases in recent weeks has led to a change in the rules when it comes to groups meeting. Until now, eight people from three households had been allowed to meet indoors in Scotland, and up to 15 from five households outdoors. But from Monday,this will changeto six people from two households and willapply both indoors and outdoors in Scotland,external- including in homes, gardens, pubs and restaurants. On Saturday,Scotland's contact tracing app, Protect Scotland, had been downloaded 800,000 times. The app, which was launched earlier in the week, uses Bluetooth technology to alert users if they have been in prolonged close contact with someone who has since tested positive for Covid-19. An Oxford University study claimed that even with an uptake of just 15%, a contact tracing app can drive down infections by about 8% and deaths by about 6% - if it is part of a manual track and trace strategy. Nicola Sturgeon said,externalit was a ""big milestone"", adding that it amounted to approximately 20% of the adult population. ""We know it will make a difference at that level"". she said, ""but the more who use it, the bigger that difference will be"". She urged Scots to encourage their friends and family members todownload the app,external. IMPACT:How is the pandemic affecting life in Scotland? CASES:Where are the latest cases in Scotland?

This video can not be played Five ways that show the scale of California's 2020 wildfires The North Complex Fire, which has been burning since 18 August, is among the deadliest in history. Ten bodies have been found so far and another 16 people are missing. California has seen at least 20 deaths in total from fires since 15 August. Tens of thousands of people are under evacuation orders as 14,800 firefighters continue to combat 28 major fires in the state. While natural factors such as strong winds have helped the spread of these massive fires, the underlying heating of the climate from human activities is making these conflagrations bigger and more explosive. Nine of the world's 10 warmest years on record have occurred since 2005, and the UN warned this week that the five years from 2016 until this year will very likely be the hottest such period yet recorded. Both Oregon and California have warmed by more than 1C since 1900. The sustained warmth has seen six of the 20 largest fires on record in California all occur this year. In Oregon, the spate of fires has burned nearly twice the average annual losses in just the past week. In California, a prolonged drought over the past decade has killed millions of trees, turning them into potent fuel for the fires. Mountain regions that are normally cooler and wetter have dried out more rapidly in the summer, adding to the potential fuel load. Climate scientists had forecast that western wildfires would grow in size, scale and impact - but their predictions are coming to fruition faster than expected. A really simple guide to climate change In Oregon, where firefighters are battling 16 large blazes, 40,000 people are under mandatory evacuation orders. The fires have killed four people but officials warn the death could be much higher. Governor Kate Brown on Friday implored householders to stay out of the fire zones despite reports of looting. ""Let me assure you that we have the Oregon National Guard and Oregon State Police monitoring the situation and preventing looting,"" she said.

She told her four children to close their eyes as they made their escape. ""Everything is gone. We have to start again from nothing, but we are alive,"" she told the news agency. At least one blaze in Oregon - the Almeda Fire, one of the most destructive in the state - is being treated as suspected arson. The smoke pollution from the wildfires has left Oregon's largest city, Portland, with the worst air quality in the world, followed by San Francisco and Seattle,according to IQAir.com,external. In Washington State, firefighters are tackling 15 large fires. A one-year-old boy died earlier this week as his family tried to escape a blaze. His parents remain in critical condition.

"Motorways to trial 60mph limits to cut pollutionThe speed limit will be reduced in Witton, Rotherham, Eccles and Oldbury.","The speed limit will be cut to 60mph in areas with higher levels of nitrogen dioxide The speed limit will be cut on parts of four motorways before October in a trial to reduce pollution, Highways England has said. It will be reduced from 70mph to 60mph in areas that have seen higher than recommended levels of nitrogen dioxide. The trial will take place on stretches of nearly five miles. It will be on M6 junctions 6 to 7 by Witton, M1 junctions 33 to 34 by Rotherham, M602 junctions 1 to 3 by Eccles and M5 1 to 2 by Oldbury. Nitrogen dioxide (NO2)released from car exhausts is a serious air pollutant and indirectly contributes to the warming of the planet. The impact of the new 60mph limit will be reviewed in a year's time Ivan Le Fevre, head of environment at Highways England said: ""Ultimately the air quality challenge will be solved 'at the tailpipe' by vehicle manufacturers and changes in vehicle use. ""Until this happens we will continue our extensive programme of pioneering research and solutions."" The Department for Transport said the trial was among a number of measures to improve air quality. As part of a plan to bring down NO2 levels, the government aims to end the sale of all new conventional petrol and diesel cars and vans before 2040. It has been consulting on bringing this forward to 2035, or earlier if a faster transition appears feasible, as well as looking at including hybrids for the first time. The consultation's outcome will be announced at a later date.

"Afghan peace talks with Taliban beginLandmark talks aimed at ending four decades of war get under way on Saturday, after months of delay.Asia","Abdullah Abdullah (centre), head of the Afghan government's delegation, called for a humanitarian ceasefire The first-ever peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban are under way in the Gulf state of Qatar. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the talks a ""truly momentous"" breakthrough, while the head of Afghanistan's peace council called it an ""exceptional opportunity for peace"". The Taliban did not mention a truce, reiterating instead that Afghanistan should be under Islamic law. These talks follow a US-Taliban security deal reached in February. Afghanistan has seen four decades of conflict, with tens of thousands of civilians killed. These are the first direct talks between the Taliban and representatives of the Afghan government. The militants had until now refused to meet the government, calling them powerless and American ""puppets"". The two sides are aiming for political reconciliation and an end to decades of violence, which began with the 1979 Soviet invasion. Three generations after a bomb blast in Balkh province - many Afghans have never known peace US-led troops have been present in Afghanistan for nearly two decades, after launching air strikes to oust the Taliban in 2001 following the deadly 9/11 al-Qaeda attacks in New York. At 19 years, the conflict in Afghanistan has been the longest in US history. One senior Afghan negotiator, Nader Nadery, told the BBC it was ""an emotional, but very very difficult and important day."" ""All of us have lost loved ones and the country that we love so much has been destroyed... it's also difficult because you face the people who, as an example in my case, killed my nephew two weeks ago. And we need to pull all the strength to face them, to talk to them."" Everyone taking part in the talks has acknowledged that they will be challenging - there are deep disagreements between the two sides, and the conflict is still continuing in Afghanistan. A Taliban spokesman told the BBC it was ""good progress"" that both sides were talking rather than fighting Mr Pompeo, who spoke at the opening of the talks, said there would ""undoubtedly"" be ""many challenges"" - but stressed that a peace deal would benefit future generations, and also affect how much aid the US provided in the years to follow. Abdullah Abdullah, the head of Afghanistan's delegation, said the two sides ""do not have to agree 100% on each of the issues before us"", but said he hoped for a humanitarian ceasefire and a peace ""accepted and supported by all Afghan citizens"". At the conference Taliban leader Mullah Baradar Akhund called for Afghanistan to have an ""Islamic system in which all tribes and ethnicities... live their lives in love and brotherhood"". ""Negotiations may have problems but should move forward with patience,"" he added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Many worry that fragile progress made in women's rights could be sacrificed,externalin the process, with one women's rights activist pointing out that ""there is not a single woman"" in the Taliban's negotiating team. The talks also present a challenge to the Taliban, who will have to bring forward a tangible political vision for Afghanistan. They have so far been vague, stating they wish to see an ""Islamic"" but also ""inclusive"" government. The talks may provide more evidence of how the militant group has changed since the 1990s, when they ruled using a harsh interpretation of Sharia law. In a statement, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said ""sacrifices"" from ""Afghans and our own troops"" had helped improve the quality of life for people in the country, particularly for women. ""These sacrifices were not made in vain,"" he said. ""The talks starting today must preserve these gains to reflect the hopes and wishes of all Afghan men and women."" He added that the alliance was ""adjusting [its] troop presence"" in the country in support of the peace process. Emotional, nervous, cautiously hopeful, worried - just some of the words spoken by Afghans to express their feelings in this moment. In a country where turning points of the past have veered into yet more violence, everyone speaks of a profound yearning for peace. But everyone knows too of the hurdles ahead. After the opening speeches, a Taliban leader remarked: ""Isn't it better to talk together than to fight each other?"" An Afghan diplomat was at pains to point out that everyone who spoke in the opening ceremony called for a ceasefire - except the Taliban. But an Afghan politician noted, positively, Taliban leader Mullah Baradar's statement where he mentioned the difficulties, but also the readiness to resolve them. The words that matter most will come when Afghans sit down for their first formal face-to-face talks. What matters just as much is what happens on the battlefield still burning back home. The US-Taliban agreement reached in February set out a timetable for the withdrawal of foreign forces, in exchange for counter-terrorism guarantees. The US and its Nato allies agreed to withdraw all troops within 14 months, while the Taliban committed not to allow al-Qaeda or any other extremist group to operate in the areas they control. The US also agreed to lift sanctions against the Taliban and work with the UN to lift its separate sanctions against the group, as well as cutting its troop numbers in the country from about 12,000 to 8,600 and closing several bases. The deal also provided for a prisoner swap of about 5,000 Taliban prisoners and 1,000 detained Afghan security personnel. Taliban prisoners preparing to leave a government prison in Kabul in August Talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban were meant to begin in March but were repeatedly delayed by a dispute over prisoner exchange arrangements, as well as violence in the country. Some of the men the Taliban wanted freed were commanders believed to have been involved in major attacks. ""We cannot release the killers of our people,"" a government negotiator said at the time. According to a report by the Washington Post last month, three Afghans accused of involvement in the deaths of US troops were also a sticking point. Taliban peace talks: What to expect The Afghan war: The short and long story Who are the Taliban? Progress was slow, but in August the Afghan government began to free the final 400 Taliban prisoners, after the move wasapproved by a grand assembly, or loya jirgaof elders. Not all of the group of 400 were released straight away, after both France and Australia objected to freeing six prisoners accused of fatal attacks against their nationals, including humanitarian workers. Their release and transfer to Doha on the eve of talks removed the final hurdle. US-led troops have been present in Afghanistan for nearly two decades, after launching air strikes to oust the Taliban in 2001 following the deadly 9/11 al-Qaeda attacks in New York. The Taliban, who protected al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, had refused to hand him over. Women in the crosshairs as Afghanistan eyes peace The Afghan women determined not to lose out 'They tried to kill my mother in front of me, twice' At the outset in 2001, the US was joined in its fight by an international coalition, and the Taliban were quickly removed from power. But the militant group morphed into an insurgent force that dug in and launched deadly attacks against US-led forces and the Afghan military, as well as Afghan government officials. This video can not be played Is peace with the Taliban possible? The international coalition ended its combat mission in 2014. The total coalition death toll by that point was nearly 3,500. More than 2,400 US military personnel have been killed. The UK lost more than 450 of its soldiers. The Watson Institute at Brown University estimated in November 2019,externalthat more than 43,000 civilians had been killed, with 64,000 Afghan security personnel and 42,000 anti-government fighters dead. The true numbers will never be known. The US continued its own, scaled-back combat operation after 2014, including air strikes.

Attenborough makes stark warning on extinctionThe naturalist warns that a million species are at risk but says it is not too late to save them.Science & Environment,"This video can not be played Sir David Attenborough met some of the few remaining gorillas in the Virunga Mountains at the time some 40 years ago Sir David Attenborough returns to our screens this weekend with a landmark new production. The tone of the programme is very different from his usual work. For once Britain's favourite naturalist is not here to celebrate the incredible diversity of life on Earth but to issue us all with a stark warning. The one-hour film, Extinction: The Facts, will be broadcast on BBC One in the UK on Sunday 13 September at 20:00 BST. ""We are facing a crisis"", he warns at the start, ""and one that has consequences for us all."" What follows is a shocking reckoning of the damage our species has wrought on the natural world. There are the stunning images of animals and plants you would expect from an Attenborough production, but also horrific scenes of destruction. In one sequence monkeys leap from trees into a river to escape a huge fire. In another a koala limps across a road in its vain search for shelter as flames consume the forest around it. Pangolins are trafficked in great numbers for their scales There is a small army of experts on hand to quantify the scale of the damage to the ecosystems of the world. Of the estimated eight million species on Earth, a million are now threatened with extinction, one expert warns. Humans 'threaten 1m species with extinction' Wildlife in 'catastrophic decline', report warns With a million species at risk, what do we save? Since 1970, vertebrate animals - birds, mammals, reptiles, fish and amphibians - have declined by 60%, another tells us. We meet the world's last two northern white rhinos. These great beasts used to be found in their thousands in Central Africa but have been pushed to the brink of extinction by habitat loss and hunting. ""Many people think of extinction being this imaginary tale told by conservationists,"" says James Mwenda, the keeper who looks after them, ""but I have lived it, I know what it is."" James Mwenda: 'Many people think of extinction being this imaginary tale' James strokes and pets the giant animals but it becomes clear they represent the last of their kind when he tells us that Najin and Fatu are mother and daughter. Species have always come and gone, that's how evolution works. But, says Sir David, the rate of extinction has been rising dramatically. It is reckoned to be now happening at 100 times the natural evolutionary rate - and is accelerating. ""Over the course of my life I've encountered some of the world's most remarkable species of animals,"" says Sir David, in one of the most moving sequences in the film. ""Only now do I realise just how lucky I've been - many of these wonders seem set to disappear forever."" Sir David is at pains to explain that this isn't just about losing the magnificent creatures he has featured in the hundreds of programmes he has made in his six decades as a natural history film-maker. The loss of pollinating insects could threaten the food crops we depend on. Trees and other plants regulate water flow and produce the oxygen we breathe. Meanwhile, the seas are being emptied of fish. There is now about 5% of trawler-caught fish left compared with before the turn of the 20th century, one expert says. Two female rhinos are the last of their kind But the pandemic provides perhaps the most immediate example of the risks of our ever-increasing encroachment into the natural world, as we have all been learning in the most brutal fashion over the last six months. The programme tracks the suspected origins of coronavirus to populations of bats living in cave systems in Yunnan province in China. We see the Chinese ""wet market"" in Wuhan which specialises in the sale of wild animals for human consumption and is thought to have been linked with many of the early infections. The programme is uncompromising in its depiction of the crisis in the natural world, admits Serena Davies, who directed the programme. ""Our job is to report the reality the evidence presents,"" she explains. But the programme does not leave the audience feeling that all is lost. Sir David makes clear there is still cause for hope. ""His aim is not to try and drag the audience into the depths of despair,"" says Ms Davies, ""but to take people on a journey that makes them realise what is driving these issues we can also solve them."" The programme ends in iconic style. We see one of the most celebrated moments in all the films Sir David has made in his long career, the moment he met a band of gorillas in the mountains on the border between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda. Gorillas face many threats but there is hope for their recovery A young gorilla called Poppy tries to take off his shoes as he speaks to the camera. ""It was an experience that stayed with me,"" says Sir David, ""but it was tinged with sadness, as I thought I might be seeing some of the last of their kind."" The programme makers have been back to Rwanda and, after a long trek, spot Poppy's daughter and granddaughter in the deep forest scrub. We learn that the Rwandan government has worked with local people to protect the animal and that the gorillas are thriving. There were 250 when Sir David visited in the 1970s, now there are more than 1,000. It shows, says Sir David, what we can achieve when we put our minds to it. ""I may not be here to see it,"" he concludes, ""but if we make the right decisions at this critical moment, we can safeguard our planet's ecosystems, its extraordinary biodiversity and all its inhabitants."" His final line packs a powerful punch:  ""What happens next"", says Sir David, ""is up to every one of us.""

After the opening speeches, a Taliban leader remarked: ""Isn't it better to talk together than to fight each other?"" An Afghan diplomat was at pains to point out that everyone who spoke in the opening ceremony called for a ceasefire - except the Taliban. But an Afghan politician noted, positively, Taliban leader Mullah Baradar's statement where he mentioned the difficulties, but also the readiness to resolve them. The words that matter most will come when Afghans sit down for their first formal face-to-face talks. What matters just as much is what happens on the battlefield still burning back home. The US-Taliban agreement reached in February set out a timetable for the withdrawal of foreign forces, in exchange for counter-terrorism guarantees. The US and its Nato allies agreed to withdraw all troops within 14 months, while the Taliban committed not to allow al-Qaeda or any other extremist group to operate in the areas they control. The US also agreed to lift sanctions against the Taliban and work with the UN to lift its separate sanctions against the group, as well as cutting its troop numbers in the country from about 12,000 to 8,600 and closing several bases. The deal also provided for a prisoner swap of about 5,000 Taliban prisoners and 1,000 detained Afghan security personnel. Taliban prisoners preparing to leave a government prison in Kabul in August Talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban were meant to begin in March but were repeatedly delayed by a dispute over prisoner exchange arrangements, as well as violence in the country. Some of the men the Taliban wanted freed were commanders believed to have been involved in major attacks. ""We cannot release the killers of our people,"" a government negotiator said at the time. According to a report by the Washington Post last month, three Afghans accused of involvement in the deaths of US troops were also a sticking point. Taliban peace talks: What to expect The Afghan war: The short and long story Who are the Taliban? Progress was slow, but in August the Afghan government began to free the final 400 Taliban prisoners, after the move wasapproved by a grand assembly, or loya jirgaof elders. Not all of the group of 400 were released straight away, after both France and Australia objected to freeing six prisoners accused of fatal attacks against their nationals, including humanitarian workers. Their release and transfer to Doha on the eve of talks removed the final hurdle. US-led troops have been present in Afghanistan for nearly two decades, after launching air strikes to oust the Taliban in 2001 following the deadly 9/11 al-Qaeda attacks in New York. The Taliban, who protected al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, had refused to hand him over. Women in the crosshairs as Afghanistan eyes peace The Afghan women determined not to lose out 'They tried to kill my mother in front of me, twice' At the outset in 2001, the US was joined in its fight by an international coalition, and the Taliban were quickly removed from power. But the militant group morphed into an insurgent force that dug in and launched deadly attacks against US-led forces and the Afghan military, as well as Afghan government officials. This video can not be played Is peace with the Taliban possible? The international coalition ended its combat mission in 2014. The total coalition death toll by that point was nearly 3,500. More than 2,400 US military personnel have been killed. The UK lost more than 450 of its soldiers. The Watson Institute at Brown University estimated in November 2019,externalthat more than 43,000 civilians had been killed, with 64,000 Afghan security personnel and 42,000 anti-government fighters dead. The true numbers will never be known. The US continued its own, scaled-back combat operation after 2014, including air strikes. The Taliban meanwhile continued to gain momentum and now control more territory than at any time since 2001.

Attenborough makes stark warning on extinction,"This video can not be played Sir David Attenborough met some of the few remaining gorillas in the Virunga Mountains at the time some 40 years ago Sir David Attenborough returns to our screens this weekend with a landmark new production. The tone of the programme is very different from his usual work. For once Britain's favourite naturalist is not here to celebrate the incredible diversity of life on Earth but to issue us all with a stark warning. The one-hour film, Extinction: The Facts, will be broadcast on BBC One in the UK on Sunday 13 September at 20:00 BST. ""We are facing a crisis"", he warns at the start, ""and one that has consequences for us all."" What follows is a shocking reckoning of the damage our species has wrought on the natural world. There are the stunning images of animals and plants you would expect from an Attenborough production, but also horrific scenes of destruction. In one sequence monkeys leap from trees into a river to escape a huge fire. In another a koala limps across a road in its vain search for shelter as flames consume the forest around it. Pangolins are trafficked in great numbers for their scales There is a small army of experts on hand to quantify the scale of the damage to the ecosystems of the world. Of the estimated eight million species on Earth, a million are now threatened with extinction, one expert warns. Humans 'threaten 1m species with extinction' Wildlife in 'catastrophic decline', report warns With a million species at risk, what do we save? Since 1970, vertebrate animals - birds, mammals, reptiles, fish and amphibians - have declined by 60%, another tells us. We meet the world's last two northern white rhinos. These great beasts used to be found in their thousands in Central Africa but have been pushed to the brink of extinction by habitat loss and hunting. ""Many people think of extinction being this imaginary tale told by conservationists,"" says James Mwenda, the keeper who looks after them, ""but I have lived it, I know what it is."" James Mwenda: 'Many people think of extinction being this imaginary tale' James strokes and pets the giant animals but it becomes clear they represent the last of their kind when he tells us that Najin and Fatu are mother and daughter. Species have always come and gone, that's how evolution works. But, says Sir David, the rate of extinction has been rising dramatically. It is reckoned to be now happening at 100 times the natural evolutionary rate - and is accelerating. ""Over the course of my life I've encountered some of the world's most remarkable species of animals,"" says Sir David, in one of the most moving sequences in the film. ""Only now do I realise just how lucky I've been - many of these wonders seem set to disappear forever."" Sir David is at pains to explain that this isn't just about losing the magnificent creatures he has featured in the hundreds of programmes he has made in his six decades as a natural history film-maker. The loss of pollinating insects could threaten the food crops we depend on. Trees and other plants regulate water flow and produce the oxygen we breathe. Meanwhile, the seas are being emptied of fish. There is now about 5% of trawler-caught fish left compared with before the turn of the 20th century, one expert says. Two female rhinos are the last of their kind But the pandemic provides perhaps the most immediate example of the risks of our ever-increasing encroachment into the natural world, as we have all been learning in the most brutal fashion over the last six months. The programme tracks the suspected origins of coronavirus to populations of bats living in cave systems in Yunnan province in China. We see the Chinese ""wet market"" in Wuhan which specialises in the sale of wild animals for human consumption and is thought to have been linked with many of the early infections. The programme is uncompromising in its depiction of the crisis in the natural world, admits Serena Davies, who directed the programme. ""Our job is to report the reality the evidence presents,"" she explains. But the programme does not leave the audience feeling that all is lost. Sir David makes clear there is still cause for hope. ""His aim is not to try and drag the audience into the depths of despair,"" says Ms Davies, ""but to take people on a journey that makes them realise what is driving these issues we can also solve them."" The programme ends in iconic style. We see one of the most celebrated moments in all the films Sir David has made in his long career, the moment he met a band of gorillas in the mountains on the border between the Democratic Republic of Congo and Rwanda. Gorillas face many threats but there is hope for their recovery A young gorilla called Poppy tries to take off his shoes as he speaks to the camera. ""It was an experience that stayed with me,"" says Sir David, ""but it was tinged with sadness, as I thought I might be seeing some of the last of their kind."" The programme makers have been back to Rwanda and, after a long trek, spot Poppy's daughter and granddaughter in the deep forest scrub. We learn that the Rwandan government has worked with local people to protect the animal and that the gorillas are thriving. There were 250 when Sir David visited in the 1970s, now there are more than 1,000. It shows, says Sir David, what we can achieve when we put our minds to it. ""I may not be here to see it,"" he concludes, ""but if we make the right decisions at this critical moment, we can safeguard our planet's ecosystems, its extraordinary biodiversity and all its inhabitants."" His final line packs a powerful punch:  ""What happens next"", says Sir David, ""is up to every one of us.""

"Dentists struggling to deal with huge backlogWarning that some surgeries are struggling, and patients will have ""nowhere to go"" if they close.","Wales was taking a more phased approach to reopening, but all four UK nations are now carrying out roughly the same levels of treatment Dentists are ""firefighting"" to deal with a ""huge backlog"" and will not catch up until 2021, the Welsh general practitioners committee chairman said. Tom Bysouth also warned many of Wales' 500 surgeries were facing the threat of redundancies or even closure. He said untreated fillings could make teeth irreparable with signs of mouth cancer not being picked up. The British Dental Association called for support, saying if practices fail, patients will have ""nowhere to go"". ""It will take a long time to catch up. Effectively, if we were acting in normal circumstances, it would take at least another six months,"" Mr Bysouth said. Dentists' plea to reopen surgeries in Wales Protective equipment issues risk to Welsh dentists ""We're prioritising the more urgent care - but as an example, I took four people off our fillings list yesterday, and put three on. ""If it stays the same, it won't be in 2020 we catch up, but 2021. We are chasing the tail."" Mr Bysouth works at dental practices in Llandeilo and Llandovery, Carmarthenshire Mr Bysouth is also concerned that, with people not having routine check-ups, signs of mouth cancer may be missed and fillings will get worse, making teeth irreparable. ""Before lockdown, a typical practice with three dentists would see around 60 to 80 people a day, but that dramatically reduced over lockdown in order to comply with social distancing measures,"" he said. Some had been seeing as few as 10 a day when they reopened because of Welsh Government rules around ventilating surgeries. Butnew guidelines,externalthat came into effect in August meant a new patient can now be seen every 20 minutes not every hour, greatly increasing the number. With laboratories not having the same level of orders for items such as crowns and bridges, Mr Bysouth also believes there could be a knock-on effect with these struggling Mr Bysouth estimates there are about 500 practices in Wales, the vast majority of which carry out a mixture of NHS and private work. However, with government financial support only available for NHS work, he believed those that did less of it were in a ""precarious"" position. He said: ""There is a risk some may have to close, let staff go or reduce their hours. Like any business model, it needs to be viable. They are as vulnerable as any business. ""People already face a 90-minute round trip in parts of Wales and 15% of practices are taking on new patients. And this was pre-Covid."" Routine dental appointments have been cancelled with only urgent work carried out 'I need three teeth out' Maxine Bullock, from Llantrisant, is hoping to finally have teeth out in October after waiting in ""horrendous"" pain for more than six months. ""My appointment was due three days after lockdown. I now need three teeth out not two... and for the last three months its been terrible,"" she said. ""Every time I ring, it goes to the end of the next month."" Sue O'Connor, from Welshpool, has been waiting since last October to have a wisdom tooth removed, but lockdown has caused even more delay. ""The tooth they were trying to save is now broken with half missing,"" she said. There have been calls for government to support private dental practices in the same way support is offered to other businesses Melanie Goodridge, from Fishguard, said: ""I have a broken tooth and it's sharp and cutting my tongue and I can't eat and can just about swallow. They told me to call back in three weeks."" The BDA estimates during lockdown patients seen on the NHS fell by as much as 98% and with practices paid for each one treated, for many this makes it ""impossible to stay afloat"" without help. ""NHS practices have been offered support,"" a spokeswoman said. ""But most practices are mixed - doing both private and NHS work. There's been no meaningful help for private practice. ""If these practices fail, their patients have nowhere to go."" The BDA called for rates holidays for private dentists, the same enjoyed by other businesses, and said the end of the furlough scheme would be a ""a major challenge"" for them as they are operate at ""a fraction of capacity"". A Welsh Government spokesman said it had created the most generous support package in the UK to help businesses, but added: ""It is clear the UK government needs to step up and provide additional funding to help businesses through this pandemic."" The UK Treasury said its furlough and self-employment support schemes had protected dental jobs, and added that firms would get a Â£1,000 bonus for each member of staff retained.

"Breaking|Breaking newsSir Terence Conran has died aged 88Sir Terence Conran, the British designer who revolutionised retail and decor, has died aged 88UK","Sir Terence's empire spanned restaurants, furniture and architecture Sir Terence Conran, the British designer who revolutionised retail and decor, has died at the age of 88. Best known as the founder of Habitat, he brought modern style and simplicity to UK homes in the 1960s and later helped found the Design Museum. ""He was a visionary who enjoyed an extraordinary life and career that revolutionised the way we live in Britain,"" said a family statement. ""He was adored by his family and friends and we will miss him dearly."" Sir Terence at the launch of the Swinging London exhibition at the Fashion and Textile Museum in 2019 Obituary: Sir Terence Conran The statement added: ""It gives us great comfort to know that many of you will mourn with us but we ask that you celebrate Terence's extraordinary legacy and contribution to the country he loved so dearly."" He ""promoted the best of British design, culture and the arts around the world"", with ""a very simple belief that good design improves the quality of people's lives"". Sir Terence started his career in the late 1940s, but became a household name as one of the key designers of the swinging '60s. His empire would go on to span restaurants, architecture and household retail brands including Mothercare, but it was for his accessible and fashionable furniture, interiors and homeware that he remains best-known. Pictured in the Terence Conran Suite at Boundary in Shoreditch in 2009 He pioneered flat-pack furniture years before Ikea arrived on British shores, helping to lower the prices of his cutting-edge designs in his bid to ""democratise good design"". Design Museum director Tim Marlow led the tributes, saying it was ""a privilege and an inspiration to know him"". In a statement, Marlow wrote: ""Terence Conran was instrumental in the re-designing of post-war Britain and his legacy is huge. ""He is revered by generations of designers, from Mary Quant and David Mellor to Thomas Heatherwick and Jonny Ive. ""He changed the way we lived and shopped and ate. He also created a great institution - the Design Museum - of which he was justifiably proud and with which he remained fully engaged right to the end of his extraordinary life."" Designer and architect George Clarke, gardener and broadcaster Monty Don, and restaurant critic Marina O'Loughlin were among others paying tribute. Allow Twitter content?

After studying textile design and setting up his own furniture studio, Conran joined an architectural firm in 1950 and worked on the subsequent year's Festival of Britain. As the '50s went on, his ambitious and wide-ranging approach to design and business became clear. A furniture workshop, a French-inspired restaurant and a coffee shop eventually led him to form the Conran Design Group. The company also designed interiors and retail spaces, including a shop for pioneering '60s fashion designer Quant. Conran opened the first Habitat store on the Fulham Road in 1964, selling taste-making and trend-setting furniture, art, home and cookery products to a burgeoning young clientele who wanted to break from drab post-war austerity. Shoppers in a Habitat store in 1973 ""It is hard to overstate how uninteresting London was then,"" he later said. ""You could go along a terrace of houses, and every living room you looked in was the exactly the same, with the same extremely dreary furniture."" Conran was heavily influenced by continental European styles, and is credited with introducing duvets to Britain. Habitat rapidly expanded across the UK, and he went on to take over Mothercare and British Home Stores, as well as running other ventures, such as his extensive and influential restaurant business - including Bibendum and Quaglino's - and The Conran Shop. He also wrote numerous books about design and food. ""The restaurants, hotels and bars we have designed or operated, the shops, the interiors, the buildings, the products and furniture or the books I have written - design is the one thing that connects them all and they add up to what I call a style of life,"" he said. He was married four times, including to Shirley Conran, who helped launch Conran Design before becoming the author of self-help books like Superwoman and the racy bestseller Lace. Their sons Jasper and Sebastian Conran both became designers, while his other three children - Tom, Sophie and Ned - by his third wife, food writer Caroline, have forged successful careers in the creative sector, notably in food writing and as restaurateurs.

"Back me over Brexit bill, PM tells MPs","Boris Johnson has urged Conservative MPs to back his plan to override part of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement. In a Zoom call with about 250 of them, he said the party must not return to ""miserable squabbling"" over Europe. The EU has warned the UK it could face legal action if it does not ditch controversial elements of the Internal Market Bill by the end of the month. And a Tory MP has proposed an amendment to the bill, which would affect trade between Britain and Northern Ireland. Meanwhile, the European Parliament has threatened to scupper any UK-EU trade deal if the bill becomes UK law. Analysis: Despite bitter Brexit row can deal still be done? UK signs first major post-Brexit trade deal Brexit to dominate week ahead in Parliament UK at odds with EU over approval for food exports The two sides have less than five weeks to agree a deal before Mr Johnson's 15 October deadline - after which he says he is prepared to ""walk away"". Informal talks are due to resume on Monday, with the next official round of talks - the ninth since March - starting in Brussels on 28 September. TheInternal Market Bill,external, which will be formally debated in the House of Commons for the first time on Monday, addresses the Northern Ireland Protocol - the part of the Brexit Withdrawal Agreement designed to prevent a hard border returning to the island of Ireland. If it became law it would give UK ministers powers to modify or ""disapply"" rules relating to the movement of goods between Britain and Northern Ireland that will come into force from 1 January, if the UK and EU are unable to strike a trade deal. The EU says the planned changes must be scrappedor they risk jeopardising the UK-EU trade talks. But the government has rejected this demand, arguing the measures in the bill are needed to protect the integrity of the UK and the peace process in Northern Ireland. Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis has admitted parts of the bill, which would go against the Withdrawal Agreement signed by the UK and EU, would ""break international law in a very specific and limited way"". Lords' anger over 'hypocritical' Brexit bill Kuenssberg: Brexit deal stand-off threatens trade talks How many trade deals has the UK done? In his Zoom call with MPs on Friday, the prime minister did not take questions and a poor signal meant the video and audio connections were lost for several minutes. He called for ""overwhelming support"" for the bill, describing it as ""absolutely vital"" to ""prevent a foreign or international body from having the power to break up our country"". Mr Johnson added that he would not countenance ""the threat of a border down the Irish Sea"". But he said there was still a ""very good chance"" of the UK and EU striking a deal by mid-October similar to that previouslyagreed between the EU and Canada- which got rid of most, but not all, tariffs on goods. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove told BBC Breakfast he believed the government had the support of Tory MPs - and those in other parties - to pass the controversial bill, but added ""we are reaching a crunch moment"". BBC chief political correspondent Vicki Young said Tory MPs had been ""looking for a sign of compromise"" from Mr Johnson, because they ""simply can't believe the government is prepared to break international law"", but the prime minister ""dug his heels in"". In a column in the Daily Telegraph,external, Mr Johnson defended the government's plans to override parts of the Withdrawal Agreement. He accused the EU of adopting an ""extreme"" interpretation of the Northern Ireland Protocol to impose ""a full-scale trade border down the Irish Sea"" that could stop the transport of food from Britain to Northern Ireland. ""I have to say that we never seriously believed that the EU would be willing to use a treaty, negotiated in good faith, to blockade one part of the UK, to cut it off,"" he said. This video can not be played Michael Gove: ""What we can't have... is the EU disrupting or putting at threat the integrity of the UK"" Mr Gove told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it would be ""irrational"" not to allow the transportation of food in such a way, which would happen if the UK was not grantedthird-country listing. Such a listing is needed for the export of food. The PM said it had become clear that there might be a ""serious misunderstanding"" between the UK and EU over the Withdrawal Agreement. He said the UK must be protected from what he called a ""disaster"" of the EU being able to ""carve up our country"" and ""endanger peace and stability in Northern Ireland"". Mr Gove said the attorney general had said the government was acting within the rule of law - and that it was important to have an ""insurance policy"". He insisted the government was being ""proportionate and generous"" in its approach to the EU talks. Conservative backbencher Sir Bob Neill, who chairs the Commons Justice Committee, said he was not reassured by the prime minister's Zoom call. He is tabling an amendment to the bill to try to force a separate parliamentary vote on any changes to the Withdrawal Agreement. ""I believe it is potentially a harmful act for this country, it would damage our reputation and I think it will make it harder to strike trade deals going forward,"" he said. At about the same time as the prime minister was speaking, the European Parliament announced it would ""under no circumstances ratify"" any trade deal reached between the UK and EU if the ""UK authorities breach or threaten to breach"" the Withdrawal Agreement. There is unease over this within the Conservative Party, with former leaders Theresa May, Lord Howard and Sir John Major urging Mr Johnson to think again.

The EU and UK have less than five weeks to agree a deal before Mr Johnson's 15 October deadline - after which he says he is prepared to ""walk away"". Informal talks are due to resume on Monday, with the next official round of talks - the ninth since March - starting in Brussels on 28 September. The EU says the planned changes must be scrappedor they risk jeopardising the UK-EU trade talksand  the European Parliament says will  ""under no circumstances ratify"" any trade deal reached between the UK and EU if the ""UK authorities breach or threaten to breach"" the Withdrawal Agreement. Boris Johnson said he would not countenance ""the threat of a border down the Irish Sea"" On Friday Mr Johnson had a Zoom call with about 250 of his MPs, in whichhe said the party could not return to ""miserable squabbling"" over Europe. Conservative backbencher Sir Bob Neill, who chairs the Commons Justice Committee, said he was not reassured by the prime minister's Zoom call. He is tabling an amendment to the bill to try to force a separate parliamentary vote on any changes to the Withdrawal Agreement. ""I believe it is potentially a harmful act for this country, it would damage our reputation and I think it will make it harder to strike trade deals going forward,"" he said. And on Saturday, Conservative MP Tobias Ellwood - who is chairman of the Defence Select Committee - also voiced his concern. ""I don't want us to lose our way, to lose our reputation as a force for good, as an exemplar holding up the international rule of law,"" he said. ""I'm afraid that's where I find myself not wishing to support this particular bill, because it does mean that we would be challenging unilaterally a Treaty. And that goes against the principle of everything we stand for."" Former Conservative party leaders Theresa May, Lord Howard and Sir John Major are also among senior figures urging Mr Johnson to think again. Both Ireland and the EU have warned that Mr Johnson's plans pose a serious risk to the peace process rather than protecting the Good Friday Agreement, as the government claims. Writing that it had become clear there might be a ""serious misunderstanding"" between the UK and EU over the Withdrawal Agreement, Mr Johnson said the UK must be protected from what he called a ""disaster"" of the EU being able to ""carve up our country"" and ""endanger peace and stability in Northern Ireland"". He said there was still a ""very good chance"" of the UK and EU striking a deal by mid-October similar to that previouslyagreed between the EU and Canada- which got rid of most, but not all, tariffs on goods. But in a column in the Daily Telegraph,external, he accused the EU of adopting an ""extreme"" interpretation of the Northern Ireland Protocol to impose ""a full-scale trade border down the Irish Sea"" that could stop the transport of food from Britain to Northern Ireland. Mr Gove told BBC Radio 4's Today programme it would be ""irrational"" not to allow the transportation of food in such a way, which would happen if the UK was not grantedthird-country listing. Such a listing is needed for the export of food.

"Dentists struggling to deal with huge backlogWarning that some surgeries are struggling, and patients will have ""nowhere to go"" if they close.Wales","Wales was taking a more phased approach to reopening, but all four UK nations are now carrying out roughly the same levels of treatment Dentists are ""firefighting"" to deal with a ""huge backlog"" and will not catch up until 2021, the Welsh general practitioners committee chairman said. Tom Bysouth also warned many of Wales' 500 surgeries were facing the threat of redundancies or even closure. He said untreated fillings could make teeth irreparable with signs of mouth cancer not being picked up. The British Dental Association called for support, saying if practices fail, patients will have ""nowhere to go"". ""It will take a long time to catch up. Effectively, if we were acting in normal circumstances, it would take at least another six months,"" Mr Bysouth said. Dentists' plea to reopen surgeries in Wales Protective equipment issues risk to Welsh dentists ""We're prioritising the more urgent care - but as an example, I took four people off our fillings list yesterday, and put three on. ""If it stays the same, it won't be in 2020 we catch up, but 2021. We are chasing the tail."" Mr Bysouth works at dental practices in Llandeilo and Llandovery, Carmarthenshire Mr Bysouth is also concerned that, with people not having routine check-ups, signs of mouth cancer may be missed and fillings will get worse, making teeth irreparable. ""Before lockdown, a typical practice with three dentists would see around 60 to 80 people a day, but that dramatically reduced over lockdown in order to comply with social distancing measures,"" he said. Some had been seeing as few as 10 a day when they reopened because of Welsh Government rules around ventilating surgeries. Butnew guidelines,externalthat came into effect in August meant a new patient can now be seen every 20 minutes not every hour, greatly increasing the number. With laboratories not having the same level of orders for items such as crowns and bridges, Mr Bysouth also believes there could be a knock-on effect with these struggling Mr Bysouth estimates there are about 500 practices in Wales, the vast majority of which carry out a mixture of NHS and private work. However, with government financial support only available for NHS work, he believed those that did less of it were in a ""precarious"" position. He said: ""There is a risk some may have to close, let staff go or reduce their hours. Like any business model, it needs to be viable. They are as vulnerable as any business. ""People already face a 90-minute round trip in parts of Wales and 15% of practices are taking on new patients. And this was pre-Covid."" Routine dental appointments have been cancelled with only urgent work carried out 'I need three teeth out' Maxine Bullock, from Llantrisant, is hoping to finally have teeth out in October after waiting in ""horrendous"" pain for more than six months. ""My appointment was due three days after lockdown. I now need three teeth out not two... and for the last three months its been terrible,"" she said. ""Every time I ring, it goes to the end of the next month."" Sue O'Connor, from Welshpool, has been waiting since last October to have a wisdom tooth removed, but lockdown has caused even more delay. ""The tooth they were trying to save is now broken with half missing,"" she said. There have been calls for government to support private dental practices in the same way support is offered to other businesses Melanie Goodridge, from Fishguard, said: ""I have a broken tooth and it's sharp and cutting my tongue and I can't eat and can just about swallow. They told me to call back in three weeks."" The BDA estimates during lockdown patients seen on the NHS fell by as much as 98% and with practices paid for each one treated, for many this makes it ""impossible to stay afloat"" without help. ""NHS practices have been offered support,"" a spokeswoman said. ""But most practices are mixed - doing both private and NHS work. There's been no meaningful help for private practice. ""If these practices fail, their patients have nowhere to go."" The BDA called for rates holidays for private dentists, the same enjoyed by other businesses, and said the end of the furlough scheme would be a ""a major challenge"" for them as they are operate at ""a fraction of capacity"". A Welsh Government spokesman said it had created the most generous support package in the UK to help businesses, but added: ""It is clear the UK government needs to step up and provide additional funding to help businesses through this pandemic."" The UK Treasury said its furlough and self-employment support schemes had protected dental jobs, and added that firms would get a Â£1,000 bonus for each member of staff retained.

R number above 1 as coronavirus cases rise,"Public health officials have warned of ""worrying signs"" of infection among the elderly, as an official measure indicated the UK's epidemic is growing again. The R number was raised to between 1 and 1.2 for the first time since March. Any number above one indicates the number of infections is increasing. The number of new daily confirmed UK cases of the virus rose to 3,539 on Friday - an increase of more than 600 on the previous day. The virus is still at much lower levels across the UK than at the peak in April, but a study of thousands of people in England found cases doubling every seven to eight days. It found a marked rise in infections in the north and among young people. Yvonne Doyle, medical director at Public Health England, said although younger people made up the greatest share of new cases, ""we're now starting to see worrying signs of infections occurring in the elderly, who are at far higher risk of getting seriously ill"". A PHE report says there has been ""a particularly steep increase"" in positive test results in the over-85s and, in the north-west of England, a rise in people from that age group being admitted to hospital. However, though cases are rising, the number of patients in hospital remains largely flat at 863. Of those, 78 are on ventilators, according to thelatest government figures,external. What are the new rules for meeting my friends? Behind the rise in Covid cases in five charts How do I get a coronavirus test? Ms Doyle warned people to follow social distancing rules, wash their hands regularly and wear a face covering in enclosed spaces. Meanwhile, Birmingham will become the latestarea to bring in new restrictions after a spike in cases. Tougher restrictions now cover more than 1.75m peoplein the west of Scotlandand, from Monday,face masks must be worn in shops in Wales. However,lockdown restrictions will be eased further in Leicester on Tuesdayto bring rules for businesses in the city more in line with the majority of England, the Department of Health said. The city has been subject to tighter Covid-19 restrictions since 29 June after a rise in cases. Across the UK,new laws on how many people can socialiseare being introduced from Monday in an attempt to hold back the rise in infections. The""rule of six""will restrict indoor and outdoor gatherings in England, Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. Police warned there was a ""real risk"" some people would treat this weekend as a ""party weekend"" before the new restrictions come in. John Apter, national chairman of the Police Federation of England and Wales, said that would be ""incredibly irresponsible"" at a time of increasing cases and officers would ""make no apology"" for fining people where appropriate. The rise in theR (reproduction) number- which describes how many others each infected person passes the virus on to - is one of several measures indicating the virus is spreading more widely in the UK. If the R number is higher than one - as now - the numbers infected are growing, with higher numbers indicating that cases are multiplying more quickly. Three other large studies have also indicated a widespread resurgence of coronavirus across the UK population. The UK is entering a new stage of the coronavirus pandemic. Since lockdown, we have been deciding how to react to falling cases. But now the R number has gone above the crucial level of 1 for the first time since March and is backed up by reams of data showing cases are growing again. This is not just contained to hotspots like Bolton - one government adviser told me the rise was widespread across the country. They said today was a ""wake-up call"" for the nation. There are already some signs that the number of people being admitted to hospital is starting to rise. But this is not a repeat of the build-up to lockdown. Cases are at a much lower level and they are growing more slowly. Pre-lockdown, the R number was around three and cases were doubling every three to four days. It is around half that now. Coronavirus is going to be a major challenge until we have a vaccine. So the defining question as we head into a potentially difficult winter is how to balance keeping the virus in check with getting on with our lives. The REACT study,externalof more than 150,000 volunteers in England, one of the three new sources of data on community levels, found ""accelerating transmission"" at the end of August and start of September. It said levels of infection were rising across England but particularly in the north east, north west and Yorkshire. Merseyside 'becomes an area of concern' Tyneside and Wearside areas added to Covid list Lockdown restrictions extended to Lanarkshire And there were increases in positive cases in all age groups up to the age of 65, with highest rates of growth in 18-24 year olds. Prof Paul Elliott, director of the study at Imperial College London, said the data clearly showed ""a concerning trend in coronavirus infections"" where cases are growing quickly across England and ""no longer concentrated in key workers"". He said there was evidence of ""an epidemic in the community"" which was not the result of more people being tested. The second set of data, from the Office for National Statistics (ONS),externalestimates there were 39,700 new cases of the virus in England during the first week in September - 11,000 more than the previous week. The ONS bases its figures on thousands of swab tests carried out in households, whether people have symptoms or not. It estimated no increase in cases for the same week in Wales,but First Minister Mark Drakeford has announced people must now wear face masks in shopsin response to rising case numbers in recent days. Katherine Kent, from the ONS infection survey, said the results suggested ""an increase in Covid-19 infections in England during recent weeks, with higher infection rates among 17-34 year olds"". Nicola Sturgeon has warned thatthe average number of cases in Scotland has been ""more than trebling every three weeks""with some areas of particular concern, including Lanarkshire and Greater Glasgow and Clyde. And the third set of figures, fromthe Covid symptom study app,external, which tracks the health of nearly four million people in the UK, also suggests a growth in new cases since the end of August - the first time since mid-June there has been a significant rise in numbers. Prof James Naismith, from the University of Oxford, said younger people would also have been affected to the same extent in January if testing had been available. ""We know that medical treatment and scientific advances have improved significantly, thus even with infection rates as bad as March and April, there will be many fewer deaths. ""The more people wash their hands and practise social distancing - especially by and around the vulnerable - the lower the number of deaths and illness we will see,"" he said.

UK must avoid 'party weekend' ahead of new rules,"People in the UK must not treat this weekend as a ""party"" before the new ""rule of six"" coronavirus restrictions come into force on Monday, a police union has warned. The Police Federation said there was a ""real risk"" that the public would ""take advantage of the current situation"". The new rules limit gatherings to six people indoors and outdoors in England. It comes as one scientist warned the UK was ""on the edge of losing control"" of the virus. England's new rule of six applies to all ages, although there are some exemptions, such as gatherings for work. Those who fail to follow the new rules can be fined by police - Â£100 for a first offence, doubling on each further offence up to Â£3,200. In Scotland, socialising will be limited to a maximum of six people inside and outside - but unlike England they must be from two households, and children under 12 are exempt. In Wales, also from Monday,it will be illegalfor more than six people from an extended household to meet indoors - but up to 30 can still meet outdoors. In Northern Ireland last month, meanwhile, the number of people who could gather indoors in a private home was reduced from 10 people from four households to six people from two households. With the introduction of the new rules in England and Wales delayed until Monday, John Apter, the chairman of the Police Federation for England and Wales, said: ""There is a real risk some members of the public will take advantage of the current situation and treat this weekend as a party weekend ahead of the tighter restrictions being introduced on Monday. ""Using the current situation as an opportunity and excuse to party would be incredibly irresponsible and put pressure not only on policing, but potentially on the ambulance service and NHS."" What are the new rules for meeting my friends? How many cases are there in your area?  Tim Robson, the North East's representative on the National Pubwatch scheme, said he expected police officers would strictly monitor bars over the weekend to ensure they are operating safely. ""There is an anticipation that everyone is going to have a big last binge, but people are starting to get fearful and a lot of licensed premises have already been clamped down on by the police,"" he said. Mr Robson, a former police officer, said it would be up to licensees to manage their premises and break up large groups from gathering together unsafely. This video can not be played ""If the restrictions are urgent why are they waiting until Monday? Why aren't they coming in now?"" On Saturday, the government announced there were a further 3,497 coronavirus cases in the UK. In Scotland, daily coronavirus cases have hit a four-month high, with a total of 221 people testing positive for the virus in the past 24 hours - the highest daily figure since May 8. The virus is still at much lower levels across the UK than at the peak in April, but a study of thousands of people in England found cases are doubling every seven to eight days. Prof Sir Mark Walport, a member of the government's Sage scientific advisory group, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""One would have to say that we're on the edge of losing control. ""You've only got to look across the Channel to see what is happening in France and what's happening in Spain."" It comes as the final clinical trials for a vaccine, developed by AstraZeneca and Oxford University,are set to resume. They wereput on hold last weekendafter a participant became unwell. The AstraZeneca-Oxford University vaccine - in which 18,000 people from around the world are taking part - is seen as a strong contender among dozens being developed globally. Meanwhile, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said the rule of six was ""well-understood"" as a public health message and had the public's support. ""As ever, the important thing is balance - eating out, seeing friends - that is fine, provided we do so in a way that is socially responsible, that's what the rule of six is about,"" he told the BBC. He added that there needed to be ""a degree of self-discipline and restriction"" in order to deal with the challenges posed by the rising number of coronavirus cases across England - and theescalating R number, which measures the rate at which the virus is transmitted. However, Mr Gove also conceded fines could be necessary to enforce regulations. ""I don't want to see fines being levied, but even more I do not want to see people behaving in a way that puts the most vulnerable at risk,"" he said. Behind the rise in Covid cases in five charts How close to developing a vaccine are we? The R number has been raised to between 1 and 1.2 for the first time since March. Any number above one indicates the number of infections is increasing. And in addition to a general rise in cases in the community, the government'slatest coronavirus surveillance report,externalshows a sharp rise in people over the age of 85 testing positive. Asked about Prof Walport's statement that the UK was ""losing control"", Mr Gove said it was ""a warning to us all"". ""There's a range of scientific opinion but one thing on which practically every scientist is agreed is that we have seen an uptick in infection and therefore it is appropriate we take public health measures."" TESTING:What tests are available? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? LOCAL LOCKDOWNS:What happens if you have one? TEST AND TRACE:How does it work? It comes after people across Englandtold BBC News they are struggling to access coronavirus tests. Health Secretary Matt Hancock said last week that no-one should have to travel more than 75 miles for a test, afterthe BBC revealed some were being sent hundreds of miles away. But some have now reported being unable to book a swab at all. The Department for Health and Social Care (DHSC) said testing capacity was targeted at the hardest-hit areas.

Teacher beats brother to win Millionaire jackpotDonald Fear is the first person to win the Who Wants To Be A Millionaire jackpot in 14 years.Entertainment & Arts,"A teacher whose brother previously won the Â£500,000 prize has gone one better to win the jackpot on Who Wants To Be A Millionaire? Donald Fear, 57, used just one 50/50 lifeline to become the first Â£1m winner in 14 years. Brother Davyth, who teaches geography, appeared on the show in September last year. Mr Fear said his brother was his ""hero and best friend"". ""Other way around now,"" said presenter Jeremy Clarkson. The history and politics teacher's final question on Friday's pre-recorded show was: ""In 1718, which pirate died in battle off the coast of what is now North Carolina?"" The options were Calico Jack, Blackbeard, Bartholomew Roberts, and Captain Kidd. 'It was Ocean's Eleven with middle-class people' Millionaire teacher is 'school sensation' Ask The Host: Does Millionaire's new lifeline work? His winning answer was Blackbeard. Mr Fear, who lives in Telford, said he had taught piracy to a group of Year 8 students about eight years ago, and remembered the date of 1718. ""I'm a dates man,"" Mr Fear said. ""You don't be a history teacher for 33 years without knowing a few dates, and the date 1718 and Blackbeard leapt out at me instantly."" Clarkson expressed his amazement at the history teacher's knowledge throughout his run of 15 correct answers. ""It's like sitting next to the internet in a pink shirt,"" he said, describing him as ""an encyclopaedia with a moustache"". Mr Fear is the sixth million-pound winner in the show's 22-year history. After his win, the father of four celebrated by going on a caravan holiday along the Northumberland coast with his wife of 33 years, nurse Debs. And his elder brother Davyth has also been part of his celebrations. ""He is so pleased for me,"" said Mr Fear. ""We went to spend a night in a hotel with our wives last week and got absolutely plastered and he kept poking me saying how pleased and how overjoyed he was by it."" Mr Fear said he wanted to give at least 70% of his winnings to his family and spend the rest on a ""comfortable retirement"". And that retirement is due to begin soon - since winning the jackpot, he has resigned from Haberdashers' Adams Grammar school in Newport, Shropshire. But he said: ""The rules are you have to go at the end of a term. ""Actually, I never investigated the possibility of whether it would be possible not to go back at all - but how unfair to my A-level students that would be?"" Mr Fear added: ""I was planning to go in two years anyway just before my 60th birthday. ""As it is, I'm going just after my 58th.""

"Rule of six won't be changed in England, says Gove","Children are included in the new limits for social gatherings in England The ""rule of six"", the latest limits on social gatherings in England, will not be changed to exempt children under 12, Michael Gove has insisted. The new rules, which limit six people to meeting indoors and outdoors, come into effect on Monday. Similar rules in Wales and Scotland do not include children under 11 and 12 respectively. But Mr Gove said the England rules were ""absolutely right"". It comes as one scientist warned UK could lose control of the virus. ""One would have to say that we're on the edge of losing control,"" Prof Sir Mark Walport, a member of the government's Sage scientific advisory group told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""You've only got to look across the Channel to see what is happening in France and what's happening in Spain."" Prof Walport said it was very important that children go to school and students return to university - but social interactions would have to be limited in other areas. ""The only way to stop the spread of this infection is to reduce the number of people we all come into contact with,"" he added. UK coronavirus cases up by 3,539 on Friday What are the new rules for meeting my friends? R number above 1 as coronavirus cases rise Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove said the rule of six was ""well-understood"" as a public health message and had the public's support. ""As ever, the important thing is balance - eating out, seeing friends - that is fine, provided we do so in a way that is socially responsible, that's what the rule of six is about."" He said some people had ""unwittingly"" contributed to the spread of the virus because of the way they had interacted, adding: ""So therefore, a clear message - as simple as possible - makes it easier for all of us to do what is helpful to others."" Speaking on Radio 4, he added that there needed to be ""a degree of self-discipline and restriction"" in order to deal with the challenges posed by the rising number of coronavirus cases across England -and the escalating R number, which measures the rate at which the virus is transmitted. Speaking on BBC Breakfast. he urged the public to behave in ""a responsible fashion"" amid fears people might treat it as a ""party weekend"", ahead of the new restrictions coming into effect next week. ""These rules and regulations are there for our protection, but also for the protection of the most vulnerable in society"", citing the elderly or those with underlying health conditions ""who face far grimmer consequences"" if they contract Covid-19. ""The onus is on all of us to do everything we can to make sure we abide by those rules. ""Then we can ensure, in due course, that these restrictions can be relaxed - and my hope, like so many, is that we can have a proper Christmas."" This video can not be played What is the R number and what does it mean? In the immediate future, Mr Gove agreed fines could be necessary to enforce regulations. Itfollows a story in the Times,external, which says the government is looking at introducing fines for people who refuse to self-isolate when required. ""I don't want to see fines being levied, but even more I do not want to see people behaving in a way that puts the most vulnerable at risk,"" Mr Gove told Radio 4. Asked about Prof Walport's statement that the UK was ""losing control"", Mr Gove said it was ""a warning to us all"". ""There's a range of scientific opinion, but one thing on which practically every scientist is agreed is that we have seen an uptick in infection and therefore it is appropriate we take public health measures."" There are fears people will treat this weekend as a ""party weekend"" ahead of the new restrictions Sage found that only about 20% of people who have symptoms or live in a household where someone else has symptoms adhere to self-isolation requirements. ""Sometimes there's an argument that's depicted, as though this is pernicious of the liberty of freedom-loving people - well there are restrictions, and I love freedom, but the one thing I think is even more important is that you exercise freedom with responsibility,"" said Mr Gove. Some Conservative backbenchers have protested about enhanced regulations, such as the rule of six, and pressed the government to follow Wales and Scotland in exempting young children. On Friday,ex-minister Steve Baker said the latest government action amounted to ""arbitrary powers without scrutiny""and MP Desmond Swayne said it was ""outrageous"" not to have a Parliamentary debate. ""This is not a fit legal environment for the British people,"" Mr Baker told the BBC. ""It's time to move to a voluntary system, unless the government can demonstrate otherwise and it is time for us to start living like a free people."" Senior Conservative backbenchers are reported to be lobbying Commons Speaker Lindsay Hoyle to make sure that legislation is being reviewed every month, not every six months.

Venezuela's Maduro says US spy held near oil sites,"NicolÃ¡s Maduro also said the Venezuelan authorities had foiled a plot to cause an explosion at another oil refinery Venezuelan President NicolÃ¡s Maduro says a ""US spy"" has been captured near two oil refineries in the country's north-western state of FalcÃ³n. In a televised address, Mr Maduro said the man was seized with weapons and large amounts of cash near the Amuay and Cardon refineries on Thursday. He said the man was ""serving as a marine on CIA bases in Iraq"". He gave no further details. The US has so far made no public comment on the issue. 'Bay of Piglets': A 'bizarre' plot to capture a president Venezuela crisis in 300 words Separately, Mr Maduro said that the Venezuelan authorities had recently foiled a plot to cause an explosion at El Palito refinery in the northern Carabobo state. He did not elaborate. Last month,a Venezuelan court sentenced two former American soldiers to 20 years in prison for trying to overthrow Mr Maduro. Luke Denman and Airan Berry were found guilty of conspiracy, illicit trafficking of weapons and terrorism. The pair were among 13 people arrested in May as they attempted to enter Venezuela by sea from Colombia. US President Donald Trump, long an opponent of socialist President Maduro, has denied accusations by Venezuela that he was behind that incident. Washington backs opposition leader Juan GuaidÃ³ and recognises him as the country's legitimate leader. Relations between the US and Venezuela are tense. Mr Maduro has accused America of manipulating political opposition to steal the country's vast oil wealth. America and Mr GuaidÃ³, meanwhile, have blamed the president for Venezuela's economic collapse.

Dentists struggling to deal with huge backlog,"Wales was taking a more phased approach to reopening, but all four UK nations are now carrying out roughly the same levels of treatment Dentists are ""firefighting"" to deal with a ""huge backlog"" and will not catch up until 2021, the Welsh general practitioners committee chairman said. Tom Bysouth also warned many of Wales' 500 surgeries were facing the threat of redundancies or even closure. He said untreated fillings could make teeth irreparable with signs of mouth cancer not being picked up. The British Dental Association called for support, saying if practices fail, patients will have ""nowhere to go"". ""It will take a long time to catch up. Effectively, if we were acting in normal circumstances, it would take at least another six months,"" Mr Bysouth said. Dentists' plea to reopen surgeries in Wales Protective equipment issues risk to Welsh dentists ""We're prioritising the more urgent care - but as an example, I took four people off our fillings list yesterday, and put three on. ""If it stays the same, it won't be in 2020 we catch up, but 2021. We are chasing the tail."" Mr Bysouth works at dental practices in Llandeilo and Llandovery, Carmarthenshire Mr Bysouth is also concerned that, with people not having routine check-ups, signs of mouth cancer may be missed and fillings will get worse, making teeth irreparable. ""Before lockdown, a typical practice with three dentists would see around 60 to 80 people a day, but that dramatically reduced over lockdown in order to comply with social distancing measures,"" he said. Some had been seeing as few as 10 a day when they reopened because of Welsh Government rules around ventilating surgeries. Butnew guidelines,externalthat came into effect in August meant a new patient can now be seen every 20 minutes not every hour, greatly increasing the number. With laboratories not having the same level of orders for items such as crowns and bridges, Mr Bysouth also believes there could be a knock-on effect with these struggling Mr Bysouth estimates there are about 500 practices in Wales, the vast majority of which carry out a mixture of NHS and private work. However, with government financial support only available for NHS work, he believed those that did less of it were in a ""precarious"" position. He said: ""There is a risk some may have to close, let staff go or reduce their hours. Like any business model, it needs to be viable. They are as vulnerable as any business. ""People already face a 90-minute round trip in parts of Wales and 15% of practices are taking on new patients. And this was pre-Covid."" Routine dental appointments have been cancelled with only urgent work carried out 'I need three teeth out' Maxine Bullock, from Llantrisant, is hoping to finally have teeth out in October after waiting in ""horrendous"" pain for more than six months. ""My appointment was due three days after lockdown. I now need three teeth out not two... and for the last three months its been terrible,"" she said. ""Every time I ring, it goes to the end of the next month."" Sue O'Connor, from Welshpool, has been waiting since last October to have a wisdom tooth removed, but lockdown has caused even more delay. ""The tooth they were trying to save is now broken with half missing,"" she said. There have been calls for government to support private dental practices in the same way support is offered to other businesses Melanie Goodridge, from Fishguard, said: ""I have a broken tooth and it's sharp and cutting my tongue and I can't eat and can just about swallow. They told me to call back in three weeks."" The BDA estimates during lockdown patients seen on the NHS fell by as much as 98% and with practices paid for each one treated, for many this makes it ""impossible to stay afloat"" without help. ""NHS practices have been offered support,"" a spokeswoman said. ""But most practices are mixed - doing both private and NHS work. There's been no meaningful help for private practice. ""If these practices fail, their patients have nowhere to go."" The BDA called for rates holidays for private dentists, the same enjoyed by other businesses, and said the end of the furlough scheme would be a ""a major challenge"" for them as they are operate at ""a fraction of capacity"". A Welsh Government spokesman said it had created the most generous support package in the UK to help businesses, but added: ""It is clear the UK government needs to step up and provide additional funding to help businesses through this pandemic."" The UK Treasury said its furlough and self-employment support schemes had protected dental jobs, and added that firms would get a Â£1,000 bonus for each member of staff retained.

Woman who sawed off own hand found guilty of fraud,"Prosecutors said the woman used a circular saw to cut off her hand (file photo) A Slovenian woman has been found guilty of deliberately sawing off her own hand as part of an insurance scam. A court in the capital Ljubljana found that Julija Adlesic, 22, had taken out five insurance policies in the year before her injury. She had claimed it happened as she cut branches. Adlesic stood to gain more than â¬1m (Â£900,000, $1.16m) in payouts. She now faces two years in prison, while her boyfriend has been given a three-year sentence. Adlesic and a number of relatives were arrested in 2019 after she arrived in hospital with her hand cut off above the wrist. The court found that she and her boyfriend had intentionally left the severed hand behind rather than bringing it with them to ensure the disability was permanent. However, authorities recovered it in time to sew it back on. Prosecutors said the woman's boyfriend had also made internet searches about artificial hands in the days beforehand. Prosecutors said this was proof that the injury was intentional. Adlesic's boyfriend's father was also given a one-year suspended sentence. Throughout the trial, Adlesic had denied intentionally cutting off her hand. Had the fraudulent claim been successful, the couple would have received more than half a million euros as a lump sum, with the rest paid in monthly instalments.

Ex-colonel jailed for murdering Spanish priestsInocente Orlando Montano is sentenced to 133 years in prison for the 1989 murders in El Salvador.Europe,"Inocente Orlando Montano was sentenced to 133 years in prison A court in Spain has sentenced a former Salvadoran army colonel to 133 years in prison for the murder of five Spanish Jesuit priests in his homeland in 1989. Inocente Orlando Montano, 77, was found guilty of ""terrorist murder"". The killings happened during El Salvador's civil war, when Catholic priests were often accused by the government of collaborating with left-wing rebels. Montano - who was extradited from the US - had denied wrongdoing. Spain's top criminal court found him responsible for eight murders. But it could not convict him for the killings of three Salvadorans - the priests' housekeeper and her teenage daughter, and a sixth Jesuit priest - because his extradition to Spain did not cover these cases. Death squad chief faces trial after 20 years Salvadorean war crimes suspect extradited I saw the soldiers who killed El Salvador's priests Montano listened from a wheelchair as he was sentenced to 26 years, eight months and one day in prison for each of the five Spanish priests' deaths, the Associated Press news agency reports. Outside the court, lawyer Manuel Olle told reporters the victims' relatives were ""very satisfied"" with the verdict. ""The truth is what this sentence says today and it says it with absolute clarity, that the crimes were planned, plotted and decided from the Salvadoran military high command,"" he said. The verdict can be appealed against. The murders took place during El Salvador's 1979 to 1992 civil war between the military-led government and the left-wing Farabundo Marti National Liberation Front (FMLN). One of the murdered priests, Ignacio Ellacuria, was rector of the Central American University (UCA) in the capital San Salvador and a leading figure in the liberation theology movement, which reached out to the poor of Latin America. The priests and the two women were dragged from their beds early on 16 November, 1989, and murdered on the university campus. Prosecutors said Montano, a former deputy defence minister, was part of a far-right group in the military responsible for atrocities and opposed to any peace deal with the FMLN. They said Montano gave ""the direct order to assassinate the Jesuits"". A man suspected of shooting the priests, ex-Lt RenÃ© Yusshy Mendoza, was a witness for the prosecution. Montano had moved to the US in 2002 and was in jail there for immigration fraud and perjury when the Spanish extradition request was made. He was extradited from the US in November 2017, having been charged, along with other Salvadoran officers, by a Spanish judge in 2011. El Salvador refused to hand over to Spain other officers accused over the 1989 murder plot.

Afghan peace talks with Taliban set to begin,"Abdullah Abdullah (centre), head of the Afghan government's delegation, called for a humanitarian ceasefire The first-ever peace talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban are under way in the Gulf state of Qatar. US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo called the talks a ""truly momentous"" breakthrough, while the head of Afghanistan's peace council called it an ""exceptional opportunity for peace"". The Taliban did not mention a truce, reiterating instead that Afghanistan should be under Islamic law. These talks follow a US-Taliban security deal reached in February. Afghanistan has seen four decades of conflict, with tens of thousands of civilians killed. These are the first direct talks between the Taliban and representatives of the Afghan government. The militants had until now refused to meet the government, calling them powerless and American ""puppets"". The two sides are aiming for political reconciliation and an end to decades of violence, which began with the 1979 Soviet invasion. Three generations after a bomb blast in Balkh province - many Afghans have never known peace US-led troops have been present in Afghanistan for nearly two decades, after launching air strikes to oust the Taliban in 2001 following the deadly 9/11 al-Qaeda attacks in New York. At 19 years, the conflict in Afghanistan has been the longest in US history. One senior Afghan negotiator, Nader Nadery, told the BBC it was ""an emotional, but very very difficult and important day."" ""All of us have lost loved ones and the country that we love so much has been destroyed... it's also difficult because you face the people who, as an example in my case, killed my nephew two weeks ago. And we need to pull all the strength to face them, to talk to them."" Everyone taking part in the talks has acknowledged that they will be challenging - there are deep disagreements between the two sides, and the conflict is still continuing in Afghanistan. A Taliban spokesman told the BBC it was ""good progress"" that both sides were talking rather than fighting Mr Pompeo, who spoke at the opening of the talks, said there would ""undoubtedly"" be ""many challenges"" - but stressed that a peace deal would benefit future generations, and also affect how much aid the US provided in the years to follow. Abdullah Abdullah, the head of Afghanistan's delegation, said the two sides ""do not have to agree 100% on each of the issues before us"", but said he hoped for a humanitarian ceasefire and a peace ""accepted and supported by all Afghan citizens"". At the conference Taliban leader Mullah Baradar Akhund called for Afghanistan to have an ""Islamic system in which all tribes and ethnicities... live their lives in love and brotherhood"". ""Negotiations may have problems but should move forward with patience,"" he added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Many worry that fragile progress made in women's rights could be sacrificed,externalin the process, with one women's rights activist pointing out that ""there is not a single woman"" in the Taliban's negotiating team. The talks also present a challenge to the Taliban, who will have to bring forward a tangible political vision for Afghanistan. They have so far been vague, stating they wish to see an ""Islamic"" but also ""inclusive"" government. The talks may provide more evidence of how the militant group has changed since the 1990s, when they ruled using a harsh interpretation of Sharia law. In a statement, Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg said ""sacrifices"" from ""Afghans and our own troops"" had helped improve the quality of life for people in the country, particularly for women. ""These sacrifices were not made in vain,"" he said. ""The talks starting today must preserve these gains to reflect the hopes and wishes of all Afghan men and women."" He added that the alliance was ""adjusting [its] troop presence"" in the country in support of the peace process. Emotional, nervous, cautiously hopeful, worried - just some of the words spoken by Afghans to express their feelings in this moment. In a country where turning points of the past have veered into yet more violence, everyone speaks of a profound yearning for peace. But everyone knows too of the hurdles ahead. After the opening speeches, a Taliban leader remarked: ""Isn't it better to talk together than to fight each other?"" An Afghan diplomat was at pains to point out that everyone who spoke in the opening ceremony called for a ceasefire - except the Taliban. But an Afghan politician noted, positively, Taliban leader Mullah Baradar's statement where he mentioned the difficulties, but also the readiness to resolve them. The words that matter most will come when Afghans sit down for their first formal face-to-face talks. What matters just as much is what happens on the battlefield still burning back home. The US-Taliban agreement reached in February set out a timetable for the withdrawal of foreign forces, in exchange for counter-terrorism guarantees. The US and its Nato allies agreed to withdraw all troops within 14 months, while the Taliban committed not to allow al-Qaeda or any other extremist group to operate in the areas they control. The US also agreed to lift sanctions against the Taliban and work with the UN to lift its separate sanctions against the group, as well as cutting its troop numbers in the country from about 12,000 to 8,600 and closing several bases. The deal also provided for a prisoner swap of about 5,000 Taliban prisoners and 1,000 detained Afghan security personnel. Taliban prisoners preparing to leave a government prison in Kabul in August Talks between the Afghan government and the Taliban were meant to begin in March but were repeatedly delayed by a dispute over prisoner exchange arrangements, as well as violence in the country. Some of the men the Taliban wanted freed were commanders believed to have been involved in major attacks. ""We cannot release the killers of our people,"" a government negotiator said at the time. According to a report by the Washington Post last month, three Afghans accused of involvement in the deaths of US troops were also a sticking point. Taliban peace talks: What to expect The Afghan war: The short and long story Who are the Taliban? Progress was slow, but in August the Afghan government began to free the final 400 Taliban prisoners, after the move wasapproved by a grand assembly, or loya jirgaof elders. Not all of the group of 400 were released straight away, after both France and Australia objected to freeing six prisoners accused of fatal attacks against their nationals, including humanitarian workers. Their release and transfer to Doha on the eve of talks removed the final hurdle. US-led troops have been present in Afghanistan for nearly two decades, after launching air strikes to oust the Taliban in 2001 following the deadly 9/11 al-Qaeda attacks in New York. The Taliban, who protected al-Qaeda leader Osama Bin Laden, had refused to hand him over. Women in the crosshairs as Afghanistan eyes peace The Afghan women determined not to lose out 'They tried to kill my mother in front of me, twice' At the outset in 2001, the US was joined in its fight by an international coalition, and the Taliban were quickly removed from power. But the militant group morphed into an insurgent force that dug in and launched deadly attacks against US-led forces and the Afghan military, as well as Afghan government officials. This video can not be played Is peace with the Taliban possible? The international coalition ended its combat mission in 2014. The total coalition death toll by that point was nearly 3,500. More than 2,400 US military personnel have been killed. The UK lost more than 450 of its soldiers. The Watson Institute at Brown University estimated in November 2019,externalthat more than 43,000 civilians had been killed, with 64,000 Afghan security personnel and 42,000 anti-government fighters dead. The true numbers will never be known. The US continued its own, scaled-back combat operation after 2014, including air strikes. The Taliban meanwhile continued to gain momentum and now control more territory than at any time since 2001.
