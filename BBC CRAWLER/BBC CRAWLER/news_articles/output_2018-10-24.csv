"Prince vows to punish Khashoggi 'culprits'The Saudi crown prince says the writer's murder is ""painful"" but there will be no rift with Turkey.Middle East","The Saudis have previously denied accusations that the prince himself had a role in the killing The Saudi crown prince has vowed to punish all the ""culprits"" responsible for the murder of writer Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey. Speaking at a business forum in Riyadh, Mohammed bin Salman said ""the crime was painful to all Saudis"" but he would never allow any rift with Turkey. The Saudis have previously denied accusations that the prince, the de facto ruler, had a role in the killing. Khashoggi died during a 2 October visit to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The Saudi government has blamed the murder on ""rogue agents"". All you need to know about Khashoggi's death Who's who in the 'hit squad'? Who was the victim? Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says the journalist, a prominent critic of the government, was the victim of a carefully planned ""political murder"" by Saudi intelligence officers and other officials. These were his first public comments since the Saudis admitted Khashoggi had been killed at the consulate. Mohammed bin Salman, the power behind the throne He said the killing was ""a heinous crime that cannot be justified"" and vowed that ""those behind this crime will be held accountable... in the end justice will prevail"". He said there had been good co-operation with Turkey, adding: ""A lot of people are trying to seize this painful situation to create a rift between Saudi Arabia and Turkey. And I want to send them a message: you will never be able to do that. ""The rift will never be there."" Is this the end of Saudi prince's honeymoon? The journalist who vanished into a consulate The three-day conference, called the Future Investment Initiative but dubbed ""Davos in the desert"" after the Swiss forum, is important for the Saudis but has already been boycotted by many Western business leaders and politicians. The Saudi crown prince met Khashoggi's son, Salah, in Riyadh on Tuesday The Saudis have tried to portray business as usual at the forum, although Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih acknowledged on Tuesday there was a ""crisis"" over the Khashoggi issue. On Tuesday the crown prince joined his father, King Salman, in meeting members of the Khashoggi family. The crown prince, 33, is considered the de facto ruler of the world's leading oil exporter. He has won some plaudits for reform, but also heavy criticism for the handling of Yemen and Qatar - and even calls to be replaced after the Khashoggi affair, amid suspicion of how much he was involved. BBC's Sebastian Usher in Riyadh It was a subject that could not be avoided. The moderator cleared his throat and asked the crown prince what he had to say. The prince declared his own and his country's revulsion at what happened. He then said that many people were trying to exploit the affair to drive a wedge between Saudi Arabia and Turkey. At the end, a now relaxed and laughing Mohammed bin Salman even made a joke about the man sitting beside him - Lebanese PM Saad Hariri, who a year ago announced his resignation during a visit to Riyadh, reportedly after facing huge pressure from the prince. The prince quipped that Mr Hariri planned to stay a couple more days in Saudi Arabia, but that he wasn't being kidnapped. If the reaction of the audience was anything to go by, the crown prince scored a PR triumph. But it's the outside world that matters - and its judgement is likely to be harsher, questioning whether the prince has really faced up to the huge challenge to his and his country's credibility and trustworthiness. The key issue is the body, of which there is still no sign. The latest focus appears to be on a well in the garden of the Saudi consulate building. Why Saudi Arabia matters to the West What is Turkey's game with Saudi Arabia? What business does the UK do with Saudi Arabia? As with much of the investigation there have been conflicting reports. The Anadolu agency initially reported the Saudis had denied permission for it to be searched, only for broadcaster NTV to say later that permission had been given. On Tuesday there were similar conflicting reports over whether Khashoggi's belongings had been found in suitcases in a Saudi diplomatic car. Mr Erdogan has said Turkey has strong evidence the journalist was killed in a premeditated and ""savage"" murder and has called for the suspects to be tried in Istanbul. The Wall Street Journal published what appears to be his strongest criticism of the Saudi government to date. This video can not be played The US President criticises Saudi Arabia's handling of Jamal Khashoggi's death When asked about responsibility, Mr Trump said: ""Well, the prince is running things over there more so at this stage. He's running things and so if anybody were going to be, it would be him."" Earlier he said: ""They had a very bad original concept, it was carried out poorly and the cover-up was the worst in the history of cover-ups."" The US has vowed to revoke the visas of those believed responsible for Khashoggi's killing - Saudi Arabia says 18 Saudi nationals have been detained - but Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the punishment would not stop there. On Wednesday, UK Prime Minister Theresa May followed suit, sayinganyone suspected of involvement in the killing would be barred from entering Britain. First, Saudi Arabia said Khashoggi had left the building alive, then that he had been killed in a ""fist-fight"" inside the consulate. This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi and how Saudi critics keep going missing It finally said that Khashoggi had been murdered in a ""rogue operation"" that the leadership had not been aware of. An unnamed Saudi official told Reuters news agency on Sunday that Khashoggi had died in a chokehold after resisting attempts to return him to Saudi Arabia. His body was then rolled in a rug and given to a local ""co-operator"" to dispose of, the official said. How Saudis changed story on Khashoggi What is Turkey's game with Saudi Arabia?

Twins torn apart by a terrible accident," Also available as anInteractive VR Experience Anna and Lauren were as close as you might expect identical twins to be. They shared a bedroom, sat together in lessons and enjoyed the same hobbies, like basketball and tennis. “People used to call us The Twins,” Anna, 23, says. “We used to get one card, one birthday invite.” “People were convinced we could read each other’s minds,” Lauren adds. The sisters had grown up in Scotland with their older sister Aisha. However, they moved to Sheffield as teenagers to live with their dad after their parents divorced. Aisha stayed behind in Scotland. “If I ever needed someone to talk to, Anna was always the person,” Lauren says. Three years ago, Anna was very focused on her future. She was studying graphic design at college and preparing for her driving test. In contrast, Lauren didn’t know what she wanted to do. She had applied for baking apprenticeships and taken some psychology courses, but nothing had quite stuck. She and Anna would talk about their futures on night-time walks near their home. “We called it pit-top hill. It was nice and quiet up there,” Lauren says. “The stars would be out and you could chat and no-one was rushed. There was laughter and banter.” The sisters enjoyed walking in the dark. That was why they got off their bus one stop early on the way home from a concert in December 2015. It was a fateful decision. Anna was crossing the road when she was hit by a car. Her head struck the windscreen and she was thrown up in the air before landing on the tarmac. “I stood there for a second thinking, ‘She’s going to get back up, she’s going to get back up,’” Lauren says. “But she didn’t, so I ran to her and saw she was shaking. I put her jacket over her as I thought it would help, but it didn’t. I was shouting to everyone who stopped to get an ambulance.” Lauren was relieved to see Anna was still breathing, but she was bleeding from the side of the head. A doctor passing by stopped to help and Lauren found herself relaying numbers she didn’t understand to an ambulance operator. Once the ambulance arrived she called her dad who rushed out to join them. At the hospital, Lauren’s dad called the family while they waited for news. “My leg was shaking so much and dad was putting out a hand trying to stop it,” Lauren says. Anna had survived but her condition was unstable and doctors were very concerned about her head injuries. The impact of the car had caused her brain to rock forwards and backwards against her skull, causing it to bleed and swell. They drilled a hole in her skull to try to relieve some of the pressure and placed her in an induced coma. One of Anna’s legs had shattered and a titanium rod was inserted from her hip to her knee. After four days, she was considered stable enough to be transferred to a neuro-intensive care unit at a nearby hospital. As her sedative was decreased, Anna made small but promising signs of recovery. She opened her eyes for a few moments, then for a few minutes. Random arm movements became deliberate ones and she made signs of recognising her sister and parents. However, there were worrying moments, too. “There were times when Anna would start saying, ‘I want Lauren, I want Lauren,’ and I’d be in front of her gripping her hand saying,  ‘I'm here,’ but she would keep saying, ‘I want Lauren’. It was scary,” Lauren says. Lauren visited her twin every day and found it difficult to go home and take a break. She experienced flashbacks of the accident that left her shaking with fear, and struggled to cope with waves of guilt and anger. “I’d go kicking doors, it was the only way I knew how to cope at that point. I had so much anger. I didn’t know what she was going to be like,” Lauren says. The interactive VR experience Is Anna OK? is available to download from theOculus storeand is currently touring the UK. You can also watch the full-length animation on YouTubehere. Doctors warned the family that Anna’s recovery would be a long and unpredictable process. They were told her brain injuries could affect, among other things, her memory, concentration, insight, motivation, mood and behaviour. Each patient was different. One unusual example was when Anna’s mum showed her ultrasound scans of her big sister Aisha’s baby, and for a few days Anna was convinced it was hers. “Her brain was slowly trying to take everything in and sort it out,” Lauren says. Anna had post-traumatic amnesia. Her first concrete memories are from a month after the accident when she moved to a neuro-rehabilitation unit. “I remember being very confused and very mentally stressed,” she says. “I used to get Lauren to help me. So if I wanted a shower she would help me to the room, and show me where the towels were kept and pick a towel and make sure I remembered my shampoo and fresh clothes. I wouldn’t have thought about these things otherwise.” Anna started occupational therapy sessions to help her with memory, planning and decision making. “They would get me to look at three pictures but I could never remember them for the next session,” Anna says. “Or they’d ask me to take away seven from a number. The guy told me not to worry about it but I was like, ‘I’m worrying about it. I can’t count.’” Anna was encouraged to keep a diary and put alarms on her phone to prompt her to do different tasks. Her family were told to try not to help her too much. Over time, she remembered the layout of the ward and settled into a daily routine. But  she frequently asked to go home, insisting she had recovered. “I don’t think I understood why I had to be there,” Anna says. “Everything was just mush in my head.” Lauren would visit each day to keep her sister company. She noticed Anna suffered from mental fatigue and would often zone out when watching TV and stare at the wall instead. “I’d see it on her face. You could talk to her but it wouldn’t go in,” Lauren says. “She would say she was bored or couldn’t concentrate.” Lauren also felt exhausted as she was never off duty. She received early morning texts from Anna and felt obliged to reply. “We’d leave notes explaining what she had to do in the morning and when we’d be there, but she’d still text, ‘Where are you? Are you nearly here? How can I see you? I can’t find you,’” Lauren says. “Sometimes we’d come and she’d still be in her jammies and not have eaten because she wouldn’t ask for help. She needed someone to say, ‘Right Anna, let’s get dressed and have some food.’ The nurses just left her to it.” Anna was discharged from the rehabilitation unit after two months. Back at home, Lauren became her main carer as their dad had to return to work and their mum could only travel down from Scotland on weekends. Lauren showed Anna jobs around the house such as how to lay the table and do the laundry. Anna was happy to be home but struggled with little to occupy her. She was frustrated that she wasn’t able to restart her driving lessons or go back to college. “She’d be angry because she said there was nothing wrong with her, but she didn’t realise she had repeated the same thing three times that morning,” Lauren says. “If people spoke too fast to her it was an overload of information and she would get frustrated because she couldn’t take it all in.” Sometimes Anna’s frustration would boil over and she would slam doors and scream at Lauren, calling her names. Lauren knew it was a symptom of her brain injury but the words still hurt. “I had to explain to Anna, ‘This isn’t my fault. What’s happened has happened, we have to slowly accept it,’” Lauren says. Anna would often retreat to her room to listen to music. She found certain songs especially meaningful, such as Jessie J’s track Masterpiece. “It goes, ‘I’m still working on my masterpiece’, so it’s saying you’re still on your journey,” Lauren says. Lauren tried to help Anna by taking her on walks back to pit-top hill. “Going up again made me feel good,” Anna says. “It helped me start remembering things.” If they went out for a meal she’d pick three options for Anna so she wouldn’t feel overwhelmed by the choice. “Lauren is the one who has always understood me,” Anna says. The family moved back up to Scotland in October 2016 so that Anna’s mum could share the caring duties. However, it meant Anna’s out-patient support stopped for months while her medical records were transferred. That winter the family decided to visit the Christmas market in town. They thought it would be a nice treat for Anna but she stood at the edge of the stalls and refused to join in with trying things on. “I could see her rolling her eyes and looking down and she was very frustrated,” Lauren says. “Dad said, ‘Oh Anna, pull yourself together, I will buy you a hat to keep you warm.’ And she said, ‘I don’t want a hat I want to go home.'” Anna felt overwhelmed by the crowds, noise and lights at the market. “I sometimes feel cut off from my family because they don’t understand. It’s an invisible condition,” Anna says. Lauren had got a tattoo after the accident in tribute to Anna. It said, “Though she be but little she is fierce.” Now Anna has got one, too – a semi-colon on her wrist. “It shows life is like a big book, if something bad happens then you just turn the page,” Anna says. Lauren wanted to work in neuro-rehabilitation after seeing how the specialists had helped her sister and her fellow patients.“I found it really interesting. Like there was one guy who was learning a word a day and he was so happy with his progress,” she says. So in May 2017, she started a job working with people with disabilities at a day centre. She thinks Anna’s accident helped to give her more patience and compassion. Anna also wanted a new start but found it difficult to be motivated. She often complained about being bored but would come up with excuses to not try various activities. However, that September she returned to college part-time to continue her graphic design course. She really enjoyed socialising with the other students but found the work too demanding. “The tutors were leaving me for hours at a computer where I would lose concentration, lose focus and get bored or frustrated. Nobody was around to encourage me or remind me what I was doing,” she says. Anna left college after six weeks. She tried to do an open study course but couldn’t keep it going with her family out at work. She spent her days helping in the house and going for walks. After coming out of hospital, Anna complained of a lack of taste. She developed a habit of not eating for a few days before starting again. Soon, this developed in to an eating disorder. In February this year, her family got a dog called Harvey to keep her company and give her some responsibility, but her health continued to deteriorate. “I got into a bad habit of not eating and walking my dog for hours. I lost a lot of weight and got into a bad mind frame,” Anna says. Her mum repeatedly took her to the doctor and finally got an urgent referral to an eating disorder clinic, only to find out it was eight weeks until the appointment.  She found the eventual treatment didn’t take Anna’s brain injury in to account. As Anna’s weight fell, her memory worsened and her mood swings got worse. She was eventually admitted to hospital after her mum pleaded with staff at the clinic. Anna was started on a re-feeding programme this summer and was discharged last month. Her family hope they can keep the momentum of her recovery going and think she is finally getting the help she needs for both her eating disorder and brain injury, with a case manager overseeing her care. “We need her to start engaging. I just want her to be happy,” Lauren says. Anna continues to lack full insight in to her condition, however she’s planning for the future and hopes to one day visit Harry Potter world in London and see the Northern Lights in Iceland. She knows she owes a huge amount to her twin sister, who has put her own life on hold. “Lauren has supported me in more ways than everyone,” Anna says. “Before the accident I used to look after her, now it’s the other way around. She’s always smiling and always strong and tries to push me to keep on fighting.” The interactive VR experience Is Anna OK? is available to download from theOculus storeand is currently touring the UK.

Ross from Friends: 'I didn't steal beer',"This video can not be played The one with the doppelganger: Many thought the suspect (left) bore a striking resemblance to David Schwimmer A UK police force's search for a Ross Geller ""lookalike"" thief must go on after the real star cleared his name in a social media video. Officers in Blackpoolshared the CCTVstill of the man, dubbed the ""spitting image"" of Friends actor David Schwimmer, clutching a crate of beer. Schwimmer responded to jokes posted onBlackpool Police's Facebook post,externalwith the video on Wednesday. He wished officers hunting the double ""good luck with the investigation"". In thevideo posted to Twitter and Instagram,external, the star is seen furtively glancing at a camera as he walks through a convenience store clutching cans of beer. ""Officers, I swear it wasn't me,"" says the accompanying post. ""As you can see, I was in New York. ""To the hardworking Blackpool Police, good luck with the investigation."" Police had earlier confirmed Schwimmer was not in the UK at the time of the offence, but the original post has descended into something of a Friends quote-fest, attracting 133,000 comments referencing the show. People made plenty of Friends gags on the police's Facebook page ""I don't think it's been this guy's day, his week, his month or even his year,"" wrote Nick Croston, while Olly Byrne quipped: ""I'm suprised you've not found him... it's like you're always stuck in second gear."" Others, such as Joe Richardson, riffed on some of Ross's most well-known quotes. ""Shouldn't he be at work...or is he on a break?"", asked Joe. While Jay Murdoch wrote: ""Apparently the police had him cornered then he performed a pivot manoeuvre and escaped."" Craig Thompson added: ""I saw him behind me in the shop around that time.. just as I was paying for MY SANDWICH."" Scottish police also got in on the act, with bobbies in Dumfries and Galloway sharing the post and warning members of the public to ""keep away"" from the suspect. ""He is known to have studied Karate and we believe he has mastered the art of Unagi, the state of total awareness,"" they wrote. Could he BE any more innocent? Police said the real Schwimmer was not in the UK at the time of the offence However, some commentators reminded their fellow Friends fans that a real-life crime had been committed. ""He's a thief and it's serious,"" wrote Grace Higham.  ""But these comments are hilarious."" 'Fred Flintstone' police e-fit mocked 'Cheshire Cat burglar' e-fit raises smiles E-fit of suspect likened to He-Man Police appealed for anyone with brand new information about the theft, which took place at Mr Basrai's restaurant on Talbot Road 20 September, to contact them. The jacket was taken from a restaurant in Blackpool's town centre The suspect is wanted for the alleged theft of a jacket, wallet and mobile from the restaurant. Police released the CCTV image of the suspect buying beer from a shop. Schwimmer starred in Friends from 1994 until its finale in 2004.

Is it wrong to wear a white poppy?,"The 2018 poppy appeal has launched, and for two weeks many people will wear them to remember British soldiers who died in wartime. The Royal British Legion chose the National Maritime Museum in Greenwich, London, for its big reveal at the start of the campaign -  a six metre high red poppy installation. The installation in London was unveiled on Thursday It is surrounded by threads with quotes from the World War One generation, marking the centenary since that war came to an end and highlighting how their legacy is ""woven through the fabric of our nation today"". Many will stick to the traditional red paper flower for this period of remembrance, but other colours may catch the eye - white poppies, or perhaps even purple - and there are black poppies too. More people than ever before are wearing white poppies, says the group which makes them. But they are also controversial - earlier this week, Tory MP Johnny Mercercalled white poppies ""attention seeking rubbish"".,external Does he speak for the majority - or are white poppies a valid symbol of remembrance? Theresa May, Jeremy Corbyn and former prime ministers Tony Blair and John Major wear the red poppy on Remembrance Sunday last year Red poppiesbegan being used as a symbol in 1921 to help to remember those who fought in war. The flower was chosen because it grows wild in many fields in northern France and Belgium - where some of the deadliest battles of World War One took place. Its use was inspired by a poem, written by serving soldier John McCrae, which begins: ""In Flanders' fields the poppies blow ""Between the crosses, row on row..."" Royal British Legion volunteers collect donations and give out poppies in the streets The Royal British Legion, which sells the red poppy, is clear that it is not a sign of support for war and death. Instead, the RBL stresses it is a symbol for remembrance and hope and should not be seen as a symbol of religion or politics. Nonetheless, some people feel the red poppy has become political, and that politicians use it to help justify war. Meanwhile,white poppiesare distributed by the Peace Pledge Union - the UK's oldest secular and pacifist group. Created in 1933 - just 12 years after the red version - many people wore white poppies to stress the ""never again"" message, which emerged after World War One, and which pacifists feared was slipping away. Like the red poppy, the white badge also symbolises remembrance for victims of war. The Peace Pledge Union says the white poppy also represents a lasting commitment to peace and the belief that war should not be celebrated or glamorised. The white poppy remembers all who are killed in war - including victims It says the white poppy remembers ""all those killed in war"" - while the Royal British Legion says it ""advocates a specific type of remembrance connected to the British Armed Forces"". You may also seepurple poppies. These are less common and created to remember the animals who die in war. Black poppiesremember the African, Black and Caribbean communities who contributed to various war efforts. Lots of people feel very strongly about wearing a red or white poppy and the issue comes up every year. This week, Mr Mercer called on people to ""ignore"" those who wear white poppies. ""If you don't want to wear a poppy don't bother; they fought and died so you could choose,"" the MP said. ""But don't deliberately try and hijack its symbolism for your own ends.""

And news presenter Jon Snow famously refused to wear a poppy on air, saying viewer demands for him to wear a poppy were a kind of ""poppy fascism"". He said he would wear a poppy ""not on the telly... but on Remembrance Sunday in concert with others"". The Royal British Legion says it is. It ""defends the right to wear different poppies"" - and some of its volunteers wear different colours side by side. But it will not sell red poppies alongside other colours, because - it says - it may cause confusion. The charity says the red poppy ""is a symbol of peace inclusive of all regardless of race, belief, origin, or sexual/gender identity. ""Remembrance is neutral on both the causes and consequences of individual conflicts and is above partisan and political interpretation,"" it adds. And the Legion highlights that the red poppy raises money to support Britain's Armed Forces, veterans and their families in their time of need. Why do people wear poppies? Has the core message of the Poppy Appeal been diluted? 'Longest-serving' poppy seller dies Orders have risen considerably in recent years said Symon Hill, a co-ordinator at Peace Pledge Union which makes white poppies. ""In the last four years we have sold around 100,000 each year,"" he said. ""The record was in 2015, when we sold 110,000. In 2017, we sold 101,000."" Sales this year - the 100th anniversary of the end of WW1 - have been ""going very well"" and the group has already sold more than 75,000. ""There is a realistic chance we might exceed the record,"" he said. Sales of the white version might be on the rise but they have a long way to go before they match the number of red poppies distributed every year - more than 40 million forecast in 2018, according to the Legion. Last year, House of Lords peer Jenny Jones, from the Green Party, tweeted that she was wearing both. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Debenhams 'seeks to close 50 stores',"Debenhams is understood to be seeking to close 50 of its 166 stores in a radical overhaul as it prepares to reveal a record Â£500m loss. The struggling department store chain has previously said 10 stores were earmarked for closure over the next five years but has raised that target. The retailer's survival plan, which wasfirst reported by Sky News,external, will affect about 4,000 jobs. Debenhams, which declined to comment, reports annual results on Thursday. About 25 store leases are due to expire over the next five years, although the company will not necessarily want to close all of those outlets. Debenhams will have to negotiate ending other leases with landlords, many of which may be reluctant to do so given the headwinds facing retailers. The chain has been under increased scrutiny since rival House of Fraser collapsed in August. Last month Debenhamssought to reassure investorsabout its finances after appointing KPMG to help improve its performance and maximise shareholder value. It said annual profits would be Â£33m - below previous guidance of Â£35m to Â£40m. It has issuedthree profit warnings this yearand shares have fallen from 35p in January to just 8.5p, valuing the company at just over Â£100m. Sports Direct owner Mike Ashley, who bought House of Fraser for Â£90m after it failed, also owns 29.7% of Debenhams. That holding, which is just below the level at which he would be required to launch a takeover bid, has prompted speculation that the two chains could merge. Last month an outgoing director from Sports Direct suggested the idea had been discussed at board level before later insisting his remarks had been misinterpreted. The retailer later issued a formal statement confirming it did not intend to bid for Debenhams for at least six months. Sports Direct has also denied claims that itwants Debenhams to collapseso it could buy it on the cheap.

Prince vows to punish Khashoggi 'culprits',"The Saudis have previously denied accusations that the prince himself had a role in the killing The Saudi crown prince has vowed to punish all the ""culprits"" responsible for the murder of writer Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey. Speaking at a business forum in Riyadh, Mohammed bin Salman said ""the crime was painful to all Saudis"" but he would never allow any rift with Turkey. The Saudis have previously denied accusations that the prince, the de facto ruler, had a role in the killing. Khashoggi died during a 2 October visit to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The Saudi government has blamed the murder on ""rogue agents"". All you need to know about Khashoggi's death Who's who in the 'hit squad'? Who was the victim? Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says the journalist, a prominent critic of the government, was the victim of a carefully planned ""political murder"" by Saudi intelligence officers and other officials. These were his first public comments since the Saudis admitted Khashoggi had been killed at the consulate. Mohammed bin Salman, the power behind the throne He said the killing was ""a heinous crime that cannot be justified"" and vowed that ""those behind this crime will be held accountable... in the end justice will prevail"". He said there had been good co-operation with Turkey, adding: ""A lot of people are trying to seize this painful situation to create a rift between Saudi Arabia and Turkey. And I want to send them a message: you will never be able to do that. ""The rift will never be there."" Is this the end of Saudi prince's honeymoon? The journalist who vanished into a consulate The three-day conference, called the Future Investment Initiative but dubbed ""Davos in the desert"" after the Swiss forum, is important for the Saudis but has already been boycotted by many Western business leaders and politicians. The Saudi crown prince met Khashoggi's son, Salah, in Riyadh on Tuesday The Saudis have tried to portray business as usual at the forum, although Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih acknowledged on Tuesday there was a ""crisis"" over the Khashoggi issue. On Tuesday the crown prince joined his father, King Salman, in meeting members of the Khashoggi family. The crown prince, 33, is considered the de facto ruler of the world's leading oil exporter. He has won some plaudits for reform, but also heavy criticism for the handling of Yemen and Qatar - and even calls to be replaced after the Khashoggi affair, amid suspicion of how much he was involved. BBC's Sebastian Usher in Riyadh It was a subject that could not be avoided. The moderator cleared his throat and asked the crown prince what he had to say. The prince declared his own and his country's revulsion at what happened. He then said that many people were trying to exploit the affair to drive a wedge between Saudi Arabia and Turkey. At the end, a now relaxed and laughing Mohammed bin Salman even made a joke about the man sitting beside him - Lebanese PM Saad Hariri, who a year ago announced his resignation during a visit to Riyadh, reportedly after facing huge pressure from the prince. The prince quipped that Mr Hariri planned to stay a couple more days in Saudi Arabia, but that he wasn't being kidnapped. If the reaction of the audience was anything to go by, the crown prince scored a PR triumph. But it's the outside world that matters - and its judgement is likely to be harsher, questioning whether the prince has really faced up to the huge challenge to his and his country's credibility and trustworthiness. The key issue is the body, of which there is still no sign. The latest focus appears to be on a well in the garden of the Saudi consulate building. Why Saudi Arabia matters to the West What is Turkey's game with Saudi Arabia? What business does the UK do with Saudi Arabia? As with much of the investigation there have been conflicting reports. The Anadolu agency initially reported the Saudis had denied permission for it to be searched, only for broadcaster NTV to say later that permission had been given. On Tuesday there were similar conflicting reports over whether Khashoggi's belongings had been found in suitcases in a Saudi diplomatic car. Mr Erdogan has said Turkey has strong evidence the journalist was killed in a premeditated and ""savage"" murder and has called for the suspects to be tried in Istanbul. The Wall Street Journal published what appears to be his strongest criticism of the Saudi government to date. This video can not be played The US President criticises Saudi Arabia's handling of Jamal Khashoggi's death When asked about responsibility, Mr Trump said: ""Well, the prince is running things over there more so at this stage. He's running things and so if anybody were going to be, it would be him."" Earlier he said: ""They had a very bad original concept, it was carried out poorly and the cover-up was the worst in the history of cover-ups."" The US has vowed to revoke the visas of those believed responsible for Khashoggi's killing - Saudi Arabia says 18 Saudi nationals have been detained - but Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the punishment would not stop there. On Wednesday, UK Prime Minister Theresa May followed suit, sayinganyone suspected of involvement in the killing would be barred from entering Britain. First, Saudi Arabia said Khashoggi had left the building alive, then that he had been killed in a ""fist-fight"" inside the consulate. This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi and how Saudi critics keep going missing It finally said that Khashoggi had been murdered in a ""rogue operation"" that the leadership had not been aware of. An unnamed Saudi official told Reuters news agency on Sunday that Khashoggi had died in a chokehold after resisting attempts to return him to Saudi Arabia. His body was then rolled in a rug and given to a local ""co-operator"" to dispose of, the official said. How Saudis changed story on Khashoggi What is Turkey's game with Saudi Arabia?

Councils buying care 'on the cheap',"Councils across the UK are buying vital home help for elderly people on the cheap, the firms providing care say. Thousands of vulnerable older people rely on councils to organise support for them for daily tasks such as washing, dressing and feeding. But research by the UK Homecare Association found only one in seven was paying a fair price for care. It said this meant visits were being cut short, but councils said they had insufficient money to pay more. Doreen Foreman is 88 and lives in the north-east of England. Carers come in four times a day for 30 minutes each. She relies on her carers for virtually everything. She has limited mobility so needs them to help her go to the toilet and to fetch her meals. She says she loves to chat with her carers because it makes her happy, but adds there is not always enough time. ""They say they only have half an hour. We manage in that time, but I would like more."" Karley Craig, one of Doreen's carers, sympathises with her. She says she would like more time, but as they need to deal with Doreen's medication and food and move her with a hoist, there is little time for anything else because Karley then has to go on to her next client. Karley says caring is something she ""always wanted to do"", but says the pay is not enough for the level of responsibility she has. ""We are doing what district nurses do,"" she adds. More than 850,000 people are given support in their own home. About 80% of this is organised by councils, which normally outsource the work to care agencies. The UKHCA, the umbrella group for care firms, asked more than 200 councils and care trusts for information about how much they paid for care. The average fee was Â£16.12 an hour, although in some places it was below Â£13. The UKHCA said the minimum price was Â£18.01, once factoring in the cost of running the services and the wages for the care worker was considered. Regionally in England, councils in the north-west and north-east had the lowest rates, while nationally in the UK, Northern Ireland paid the least. UKHCA policy and campaigns director Colin Angel accused councils of buying care ""on the cheap"". He said it was forcing a number of providers to hand back contracts or refuse to take them on as the prices did not cover ""adequate wages and the costs of running safe and effective services"". He said that was having an impact on recruitment and retention and forcing services to cut back on the number and length of visits. Caroline Abrahams, of Age UK, said this was having a terrible impact on vulnerable older people. ""It's difficult not to feel anxious if you are an older person who relies on care at home."" Councillor Ian Hudspeth, of the Local Government Association, acknowledged there was a problem, but said councils could not afford to pay more as the system was at ""breaking point"". ""Councils, care providers, charities and the NHS are all united around the need for central government to fully fund adult social care,"" he added. The Department of Health and Social Care spokesperson said it would be setting out its plans for the funding of social care in a Green Paper later this year.

Falls wipe out Wall Street's 2018 gains,"European share markets have steadied after big falls in Asian stocks that followed a bruising trading session on Wall Street. Tokyo stocks slumped more than 3%, while losses pushed the US Dow Jones Industrial Average and the S&P 500 into negative territory for the year. European markets followed suit at first, but had risen by lunchtime, with London's FTSE 100 up 0.17%. Concerns over corporate profits and slowing growth have rattled investors. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average sank 2.4% to 24,583.4 points, while the S&P 500 plunged 3.1% to 2,656.1 points on Wednesday. The technology-focused Nasdaq dropped more than 4.4% to 7,108.4 points - its worst day since 2011 - amid concerns about weak corporate profits and global trade tensions. It was the worst day since 2011 for the index, which is now 10% lower than its September peak and in ""correction"" territory. Even technology firms, which have driven much of the market gains this year, did not escape the sell-off, with Amazon falling 5.9%, Facebook down 5.4%, Google owner Alphabet off 4.8% and Netflix sinking 9.4%. Stephen Innes, Asia-Pacific head of trading at Oanda, said in a research note the tech sector had previously been seen as ""impervious to weaker global growth sentiment, but escalating US-China trade tension remains that sectors undoing"". Wednesday's losses marked a sixth straight day of declines on the S&P and followedturbulence earlier in October. The Dow is now on track for its worst month since May 2010. Investors were also spooked by figures on Wednesday showing new home sales fell last month to their slowest pace in nearly two years. They underlined other reports suggesting the US housing market is weakening - a worry given the sector is seen as a bellwether of economic health by many. Investors have also grown nervous as growth in China slows and companies report increased costs due to labour shortages and tariffs. Those forecasts hit companies such as Caterpillar, down 5.6%, and 3M, off 4.2%. The falls compounded declines on Tuesday in the wake of disappointing results. Nate Thooft at Manulife Mutual Funds said: ""Costs are increasing and it's often tariff-related. We also reached a potential peak for earnings - companies that show marginal weakness take a beating."" Adding to the sense of unease were a series of crude mail bombs and suspicious packages sent to prominent Democrats and critics of President Donald Trump, including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, less than a fortnight before the midterm elections. Jack Ablin at Cresset Wealth Advisors said the selling appeared to be ""emotionally"" driven, adding: ""Perhaps it's just a ratcheting up of chaos."" The losses on major European indexes were less severe. The pan-European STOXX 600 fell as much as 1% before paring losses slightly to trade down 0.7% Wildfire sweeps through Hollywood Hills and threatens landmarks as chaos grips LA Paris Hilton among stars 'heartbroken' as she watches home 'burn to ground' Commuters warned of icy roads as cold snap continues to freeze UK Sound Of 2025: Ezra Collective are 'keeping music real' The Papers: 'Apocalypse' LA and 'Reeves faces extra tax rises' How Australia's beach cabana drama sparked a turf war H-1B: Visa row under Trump fuels anxiety for Indian dreamers 'I thought I was going to die': Jailed Venezuelan activist details brutality of prison life The man who could become Canada's future PM 'Trump 2.0' looms large over the global economy A politician was shot dead in Bangkok.

Cancer survivors 'face holiday injustice',"Cancer survivors should not have to declare their former diagnosis to insurance firms years after going into complete remission, a campaign group has told the BBC. Youth Cancer Europe said this elevated prices, with one man quoted Â£3,000 for insurance for two weeks in Australia. Tory and Labour MPs called for the ""discrimination"" to end. The Association of British Insurers said it was speaking with cancer charities and consumer groups. Youth Cancer Europe told the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme those given the all-clear from cancer still face a ""lifetime penalty"" of expensive travel insurance. ""To put it in perspective, convicted persons in the European Union have their criminal record expired within several years after serving the sentence,"" it said. ""Cancer survivors, on the other hand, must declare their cancer history throughout their life and continue to suffer discrimination."" The group wants the UK government to implement a similar system to France, where cancer survivors no longer have to inform insurers or loan agencies about their diagnosis after a period of 10 years after their treatment has ended - or five years for anyone who was under 18 when they had treatment. Seren Hughes says the current situation is ""completely unfair"" Twenty-three-year-old Seren Hughes, who was diagnosed with ovarian cancer in 2015, said the current situation was ""completely unfair"", having been charged more for travel insurance than her flights during a recent trip to Brussels. ""I've had the all-clear for three years and have just recently run a marathon, but I'm seen as a massive risk. ""Cancer impacts your life enough, never mind not being able to get insurance to go to a family wedding."" Youth Cancer Europe said one 22-year-old man had been quoted Â£3,000 for insurance for a two-week holiday to Australia, three years after being told he was cancer-free.  He decided to travel without insurance. Labour MP Ben Bradshaw, who sits on the cross-party Health and Social Care Committee, told the Victoria Derbyshire programme: ""this would appear to be a glaring injustice"", with those affected ""facing unjustified discrimination"". ""This situation could become much more serious in March next year if there is a hard or no-deal Brexit,"" he added, ""as the European Health Insurance Card would become invalid and UK visitors to the continent would also need to take out health insurance"". He said for cancer survivors this ""could be prohibitively expensive"". Conservative MP Mark Pritchard added that ""discrimination against cancer sufferers needs to end. ""This needs to be led by the insurance industry, who might be guilty of exploiting those who are seriously ill. I hope ministers will intervene and demand answers."" SNP MP Lisa Cameron said: ""We must redress this insurance injustice. ""If medical opinion says they have the all-clear, insurance companies cannot simply ignore it and charge astronomical fees."" The Association of British Insurers said: ""This is an important issue and we are already working with the regulator, the wider industry and consumer bodies on how to improve the customer experience for people with pre-existing medical conditions. ""We also want to continue our dialogue with cancer charities on these issues and work with them to help improve access to insurance.""

Secret tape has XXXTentacion confession,"Audio has emerged of late rapper XXXTentacion apparently admitting assaulting his ex-girlfriend and stabbing nine people. The recording was made in secret and is believed to date from 2016, when he was accused of aggravated battery of a pregnant woman. The Miami-Dade County state attorney's office said he ""makes admissions to multiple criminal acts"" in the audio. The 20-year-oldwas shot and killed in south Florida in June. At the time of his death, the star, real name Jahseh Onfroy, was awaiting trial for domestic violence charges, harassment and witness tampering - all of which he denied. The Miami-Dade County state attorney said the recording was thought to have been made around the time of his arrest in October 2016 for the assault and false imprisonment of his ex-girlfriend, Geneva Ayala. A spokesman for the state attorney's office said: ""Both defense and state believed the tape had confessions of criminal activity on it."" The troubled talent of murdered rap star XXXTentacion Four men charged with XXXTentacion murder XXXTentacion's girlfriend is pregnant In the recording, the rapper discusses his ex-girlfriend, who he believed had cheated on him. He can be heard saying: ""I put my source of happiness in another person, which was a mistake initially, right? But she fell through on every occasion until now."" He goes on to say how he began assaulting her, adding: ""Now she's scared. That girl is scared for her life. Which I understand."" Earlier in the recording, he vowed to kill her ""if she play with me"". XXXTentacion's mugshot from December 2017 In addition to the threats against his ex-girlfriend, the rapper also referred to a stabbing incident in Florida, saying: ""I'm on [Miami] New Times for stabbing, how many people they put in the news? They said three, it was eight. In Deerfield. ""She's seen this..."" he continues, referring to Ayala. ""She know. So she's scared. She thinks I'm going to kill her."" In January 2016 a local Florida newspaper, the Sun Sentinel, reported that police were ""searching for the person who stabbed three people during a fight in Deerfield Beach."" XXXTentacion also admitted to stabbing a former manager, an incident for which he was arrested in Orange County, Florida.

"Expat, 93, fights for UK frozen pensions","A 93-year-old British expatriate living in Canada is flying to London to take up her fight against frozen pensions. Anne Puckridge, who left the UK 17 years ago to be closer to family, says a law freezing the pensions of Brits who have moved abroad is unfair. At the time she left, her pension was Â£72.50 a week; if she had stayed, it would now be worth Â£125.95 a week. She plans to present a petition of more than 200,000 signatures to the prime minister's residence. Mrs Puckridge, who campaigns for the International Consortium of British Pensioners, told the BBC the law has seriously diminished her quality of life. ""I have to be so careful with what I spend. I have to be so careful with Christmas and birthdays especially - I can't indulge my family,"" she said. On Thursday, she will fly to London, where she plans to deliver the petition to Downing Street. ""It's the injustice of it that gets to me,"" she said. Organisers for the consortium have also invited MPs to meet with her to discuss the issue directly. This is not the first time she has made the journey. She was in London campaigning four years ago; but nothing in the interim has changed. ""They won't answer our questions and when they do they send us back boilerplated answers. They just won't listen,"" she said. In total, she says she believes she's lost Â£22,000 from her pension. At 17, Anne Puckridge enlisted to serve during World War Two The policy was under scrutiny in 2010, when The European Court of Human Rights rejected an appeal by a group of pensioners. About half of UK pensioners retired abroad live in one of 50 countries, including Spain, France and the United States, in which they are entitled to receive the same state pension as UK residents - Â£125.95 per week. But if they retire to other countries not on that list - including many Commonwealth members such as Canada, Australia and South Africa - their pension will be frozen at the date of retirement. 'Frozen pension' victims abroad urge action An all-party parliamentary group (APPG) is currently discussing the issue. APPGs have no formal status in Parliament but are used by MPs and others to raise awareness of a wide range of issues. The cost of increasing all the overseas pensions to the same level has been estimated at more than Â£600m a year.

'Explosives' sent to Democrats and CNN,"This video can not be played Donald Trump: Threats of any kind have no place in the United States of America"" Suspected explosive devices have been sent to top Democrats including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, as well as CNN, US officials have said. It comes two days after a pipe bomb was found at the home of liberal philanthropist and financier George Soros in the suburbs of New York City. CNN's New York office was evacuated on Wednesday morning after a suspected bomb was sent to their mailroom. President Donald Trump said that these threats ""have no place in America"". Speaking at the White House, Mr Trump said that he has been briefed by the FBI and ""a major federal investigation is now under way"". ""The safety of the American people is my highest and absolute priority,"" he said. ""In these times we just have to unify. We need to come together and send one very clear unmistakable message that threats or acts of political violence of any kind have no place in America."" An image of the bomb that was sent to CNN When asked about the pattern of these attempted attacks, during a news conference, New York Police Commissioner O'Neill said law enforcement is proactively contacting people to ensure other mail rooms ""follow proper protocol"". The FBI in New York said they were aware of the suspected packages,external, and that their Joint Terrorism Task force is aiding in the investigation. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio decried the attempted attacks as ""an act of terror attempting to undermine our free press and leaders of this country"". ""To all public officials, to all partisan affiliations - don't encourage violence, don't encourage hatred, don't encourage attacks on media you can disagree but you have to show respect."" The packages were addressed to former President Obama, ex-Secretary Clinton and former CIA Director John Brennan. Additional suspicious packages addressed to Democratic Representative Maxine Waters and former Attorney General Eric Holder are currently being investigated by law enforcement. This video can not be played Cuomo: ""What is not good is overheated rhetoric and extremism that pushes people to violence."" The packages to Mr Obama and Mrs Clinton were intended to arrive at their residences. FBI Special Agent Bryan Paarman told reporters the device for Mr Brennan, which appeared to be live, had been sent to CNN's mailroom. One of the packages sent had listed Congresswoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz, the former chairwoman of the Democratic National Committee, as the sender. The package intended for Mr Holder was sent to an incorrect address and returned to the congresswoman's office in Sunrise, Florida, US media say. Mr Brennan was scheduled to appear on CNN on Wednesday, US media report. Mr Brennan, is a frequent contributor to the network and has become a vocal critic of Mr Trump since leaving office. The Time Warner building in New York City was evacuated on Wednesday morning According to a statement from the US Secret Service, the package addressed to Mrs Clinton was recovered late on 23 October. ""Early this morning, October 24, 2018, a second package addressed to the residence of Former President Barack Obama was intercepted by Secret Service personnel in Washington, DC,"" the statement adds. ""Both packages were intercepted prior to being delivered to their intended location. The protectees did not receive the packages nor were they at risk of receiving them."" Allow Twitter content?

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo had said a suspicious package had been sent to his office, but New York police told the BBC ""it was a thumb drive and is not related to other events"". The devices are suspected to be pipe bombs. Law enforcement officials tell US media that the device discovered at CNN on Wednesday appears to be similar to the one found at Mr Soros' home on Monday. Police commissioner Mr O'Neill also said law enforcement found an ""envelope containing white powder"" in the packaging of the device sent to CNN. The powder is being investigated, but authorities found ""no additional threats"" after sweeping the area.

Suspect packages in US are 'act of terror',"This video can not be played Donald Trump: ""Stop endless hostility"" President Donald Trump has called on the media ""to stop the endless hostility"", after suspected explosives were posted to high-profile US figures. He was speaking after parcels were sent to CNN and top Democrats, including Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton. None of the packages exploded. The FBI has launched a hunt for their sender. The president's critics called his comments hypocritical, as he often uses vicious language against his opponents and the press. Trump Jr letter: 'You get what you deserve' Trump ends ex-CIA head's security access Explosive device found in Soros post box In scripted remarks at a Wednesday night rally in Wisconsin, the president vowed to catch the perpetrator, while calling on the media to end ""constant negative and oftentimes false attacks and stories"". Mr Trump also called for more civility in public life, saying: ""Those engaged in the political arena must stop treating political opponents as being morally defective. ""No one should carelessly compare political opponents to historic villains, which is done often."" However, the president made no specific reference to the intended recipients of the packages. Earlier CNN worldwide president Jeff Zucker criticised President Trump and the White House press secretary for not understanding that ""words matter"". ""There is a total and complete lack of understanding at the White House about the seriousness of their continued attacks on the media,"" he said. Suspected bombs were sent to locations in New York, the Washington DC area and Florida, authorities said on Wednesday. Explosive devices were sent to the following individuals, according to the latest FBI statement: Former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton Former President Barack Obama Former CIA Director John Brennan, care of CNN Former Attorney General Eric Holder California Democratic Congresswoman Maxine Waters Liberal philanthropist and financier George Soros (on Monday) CNN's New York office was evacuated on Wednesday morning after the package, addressed to Mr Brennan, was found in its mailroom. The Time Warner building in New York City was evacuated on Wednesday morning Another package, believed to have been addressed to former Vice-President Joe Biden, is being sought by US federal investigators. All the apparent targets are regularly criticised by conservatives - especially by President Trump. Why Trump attacks the media Some Democrats have accused the president of inciting violence with his past rhetoric, which includes deriding media reports as ""fake news"" and calling his media critics ""enemies of the people"".

British student in UAE court on spying charge,"Daniela Tejada has repeatedly rejected suggestions her husband, Matthew Hedges, is a spy A British academic accused of spying by the United Arab Emirates has appeared in court. Matthew Hedges, a 31-year-old PhD student at Durham University, was arrested on 5 May in Dubai and has reportedly been held in solitary confinement for five months. In a short hearing in the UAE, Mr Hedges' lawyer requested an adjournment and the next hearing was scheduled for 21 November. He denies spying for the UK government. Mr Hedges was detained at Dubai Airport as he was leaving the country following a research trip. His family said he had been researching the impact of the Arab Spring on the UAE's foreign policy and security strategy when he was arrested. More than 100 academics from around the world have signed a petition demanding the release of Mr Hedges Mr Hedges' wife, Daniela Tejada, of Exeter, has previously said he hadnot received ""appropriate medical care and attention, especially in regard to his mental health""during his time in solitary confinement. ""Since he was detained he has only ever been granted two consular visits which is in direct violation of his rights."" However, in a statement released earlier the UAE government said it had carried out a welfare review which concluded he had been provided with ""constant medical attention and psychological care"". Mohammed Obaid Al Zaabi, director of the Department of the Foreign Nationals Affairs Department, said members of Mr Hedges' family and embassy staff ""were given access to him on several occasions in accordance with UAE laws and regulations"". He was able to contact family and legal staff by phone, his statement said, and had been provided with books and reading materials of his choice. Now his trial was under way he is being accommodated in a ""lower security remand centre"". He said Mr Hedges' right to a fair trial was ""guaranteed"" by the UAE constitution, which presumes people are ""innocent until proven otherwise"".

Anger after 'hardcore huntress' shoots goat,"Ms Switlyk posted a photograph of herself next to a dead goat on Tuesday Photos of an American TV presenter posing beside wild goats shot dead in Scotland have been condemned by a Scottish government minister. Mike Russell was responding to social media posts showing Larysa Switlyk hunting on the island of Islay Ms Switlyk, who describes herself as a ""hardcore huntress"", hosts the Larysa Unleashed programme. Mr Russell, who is the local MSP for the area, told BBC Scotland that the images were ""horrific"". He said he had contacted Scotland's environment secretary, Roseanna Cunningham, to call for goat hunting to be ""stopped immediately"" on the island. Several tourism companies offer the chance to stalk and shoot wild goats in Islay, Dumfries and Galloway and other parts of the UK. Allow Twitter content?

Speaking to BBC Scotland's John Beattie programme, Mr Russell insisted that Ms Switlyk's goat hunting was worse than the hunting of red deer, which he said was ""very firmly regulated"" and ""you don't see people glorifying in it very often."" The Brexit secretary added: ""The pictures are horrific. Obviously deer culling and deer stalking is established on the island and it's a necessary thing to do considering the lack of control of deer numbers. ""But to see people in camouflage with highly powered sniper rifles rejoicing at the killing of a goat, let alone a ram, is simply unacceptable. ""The vast majority of people would just not regard this as something that should be happening in their country. ""There has been something of an outcry already about it and as a local MSP I have now raised it with the environment minister because I think it's really undesirable and unpleasant."" Mr Russell said it was not clear whether anything could be done to stop goat hunting from happening, but he said he had a duty to raise it as ""this isn't 21st Century Scotland. This isn't 21st Century Islay"". Ms Switlyk was also condemned by Scottish Greens MSP Mark Ruskell, who urged the Scottish government to ""make it known that bloodsport participants are unwelcome to visit Scotland for the barbaric practice"". The Scottish government said it understood the concern over images of hunted animals animals being held up as trophies. But it stressed that the killing of goats and deer is not illegal, and can be a ""necessary part of sustainable land management"" if done responsibly. A spokesman said: ""The environment secretary will review the situation and consider whether any clarification of or changes to the law might be required."" The Scottish Country Sports Tourism group said country sports tourism was worth Â£155m to the Scottish economy every year. Ms Switlyk, who is understood to have been filming in Scotland, has not yet responded to requests for comment. TheLarysa Unleashed website,externalsays the presenter ""promotes the outdoor lifestyle, offering a taste of the adventure as she blossoms into a hardcore huntress. ""Along the way Larysa wants to encourage the public, especially kids and females, to go hunting and experience the great outdoors. ""Whether it's teaching them to shoot a gun for the first time, or hunting alongside her for an amazing trophy, it will be nothing less than an extreme adventure"". Feral goats are thought to have roamed parts of Scotland and the north of England for about 5,000 years, and were introduced by Stone Age humans. There are currently estimated to be about 3,000 animals in herds spread across the UK.

China's secret in the desert," On 12 July 2015 a satellite swung over the rolling deserts and oasis cities of China's vast far west. One of the images it captured that day just shows a patch of empty, untouched, ashen-grey sand. It seems an unlikely place to start an investigation into one of the most pressing human rights concerns of our age. But less than three years later, on 22 April 2018, a satellite photo of that same piece of desert showed something new. A massive, highly secure compound had materialised. It is enclosed with a 2km-long exterior wall punctuated by 16 guard towers. The first reports that China was operating a system of internment camps for Muslims in Xinjiang began to emerge last year. The satellite photograph was discovered by researchers looking for evidence of that system on the global mapping software, Google Earth. It places the site just outside the small town of Dabancheng, about an hour's drive from the provincial capital, Urumqi. To try to avoid the suffocating police scrutiny that awaits every visiting journalist, we land at Urumqi airport in the early hours of the morning. But by the time we arrive in Dabancheng we're being followed by at least five cars, containing an assortment of uniformed and plain-clothes police officers and government officials. It's already clear that our plan to visit a dozen suspected camps over the course of the next few days is not going to be easy. As we drive up the wide approach road we know that sooner or later the convoy behind is going to try to stop us. While still a few hundred metres away, we see something unexpected. The wide expanse of dusty ground, shown on the satellite image to the east of the site, is empty no more. In its place, a huge extension project is taking shape. The site at Dabancheng seen from the road Like a mini-city sprouting from the desert and bristling with cranes, are row upon row of giant, grey buildings - all of them four storeys high. With our cameras rolling we try to capture the extent of the construction, but before we can go much further one of the police cars swings into action. Our car is stopped - we're told to turn off the cameras and to leave. But we've discovered something of significance - a huge amount of extra activity that has so far gone unnoticed by the outside world. In remote parts of the world, Google Earth images can take months or years to update. Other public sources of satellite photography however - like the European Space Agency's Sentinel database - provide much more frequent images, although they're of a much lower resolution. It is here that we find what we are looking for. An October 2018 Sentinel image shows just how much the site has grown compared with what we'd expected to see. What we suspected to be a big internment camp, now looks like an enormous one. And it is just one of many similar, large prison-type structures that have been built across Xinjiang in the past few years. Before our attempt to visit the site, we'd stopped in the centre of Dabancheng. It was impossible to speak openly to anyone - minders lurked menacingly close by and would aggressively debrief anyone who even exchanged a greeting with us. There are tens of thousands of people [at the ‘re-education school’]... They have some problems with their thoughts Instead, we telephoned random numbers in the town. What was this large complex with its 16 watchtowers that the authorities were so desperate to stop us filming? “It's a re-education school,” one hotelier told us. “Yes, that's a re-education school,” another shopkeeper agreed. “There are tens of thousands of people there now. They have some problems with their thoughts.” This giant facility would of course fit no objective definition of a school. In Xinjiang “going to school” has come to take on a meaning all of its own. A still from a Chinese state TV report on the Uighur “schools” China has consistently denied that it is locking up Muslims without trial. Images from Chinese state TV show life inside the ""schools"" But a euphemism for the camps has long existed - education. Almost certainly as a response to the mounting international criticism, the authorities have begun to double down on this description, with a full-on propaganda drive. State-run TV has been showing glossy reports, full of clean classrooms and grateful students, apparently willingly submitting themselves to the coursework. There is no mention of the grounds on which the students have been chosen for this “study” or how long the courses last. But there are clues. The interviews sound more like confessions. “I have deeply understood my own mistakes,” one man tells the camera, vowing to be a good citizen “after I get home”. The main purpose of these facilities, we're told, is to combat extremism, through a mixture of legal theory, work skills and Chinese language training. That last item shows that whatever you want to call them - schools or camps - the intended target is the same. The facilities are exclusively for Xinjiang's Muslim minorities, many of whom do not speak Chinese as their mother tongue. The video suggests the school is operating a dress code - not a single one of the female students is wearing a headscarf. There are more than 10 million Uighurs in Xinjiang. They speak a Turkic language and resemble the peoples of Central Asia at least as much as they do China's majority population, the Han Chinese. The southern city of Kashgar, it is often pointed out, is geographically closer to Baghdad than it is to Beijing - and it sometimes feels culturally closer too. And with a history of rebellion and resistance to Chinese rule, the relationship between the Uighurs and their modern-day political masters has long been as fraught as it is distant. Before Communist rule, Xinjiang occasionally slipped from China's grip with brief periods of independence.  Ever since, it has constantly tested that grip with sporadic outbreaks of protest and violence. The mineral wealth - in particular oil and gas - of a region almost five times the size of Germany has brought huge levels of Chinese investment, rapid economic growth and large waves of Han Chinese settlers. Resentment among Uighurs over the perceived uneven distribution of the proceeds of that growth has simmered. In response to such criticisms, the Chinese authorities point to rising living standards for Xinjiang's residents. But in the past decade or so, hundreds of lives have been lost to a mixture of riots, inter-community violence, premeditated attacks and the police response. October 2013: Tiananmen Square sealed off after a car attack which killed two people In 2013, an attack on pedestrians in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, which claimed two lives as well as the three Uighur occupants of the car, marked a significant moment. Although relatively small in terms of fatalities it rattled the foundations of the Chinese state. March 2014: Police in Kunming on patrol after the killing of 31 people The following year, 31 people were slaughtered by knife-wielding Uighur attackers at a train station in the Chinese city of Kunming, more than 2000km away from Xinjiang. Over the past four years, Xinjiang has been the target of some of the most restrictive and comprehensive security measures ever deployed by a state against its own people. These include the large-scale use of technology - facial recognition cameras, monitoring devices that read the content of mobile phones and the mass collection of biometric data. Harsh new legal penalties have been introduced to curtail Islamic identity and practice - banning, among other things, long beards and headscarves, the religious instruction of children, and even Islamic-sounding names. The policies appear to mark a fundamental shift in official thinking - separatism is no longer framed as a problem of a few isolated individuals, but as a problem inherent within Uighur culture and Islam in general. It coincides with a tightening grip on society under President Xi Jinping, in which loyalties to family and faith must be subordinate to the only one that matters - loyalty to the Communist Party. The Uighurs' unique identity makes them a target for suspicion. That view has been reinforced by credible reports that hundreds have travelled to Syria to fight with various militant groups. Uighurs are now subject to ethnic profiling at thousands of pedestrian and vehicle checkpoints while Han Chinese residents are often waved through. A police checkpoint in Kashgar, March 2017 They face severe travel restrictions, both within Xinjiang and beyond, with an edict forcing residents to surrender all passports to the police for “safe keeping”. Uighur government officials are prohibited from practising Islam, from attending mosques or from fasting during Ramadan. A Chinese flag flies above a closed mosque in the Xinjiang city of Kashgar Given all this, it is perhaps not that surprising that China has introduced another older and blunter solution to the perceived disloyalty of many of its Uighur citizens. Despite the government's denials, the most compelling evidence for the existence of the internment camps comes from a trove of information from the authorities themselves. Pages of local government tendering documents inviting potential contractors and suppliers to bid for the building projects have been discovered online by the German-based academic, Adrian Zenz. They provide details about the construction or conversion of dozens of separate facilities across Xinjiang. In many cases the tenders call for the installation of comprehensive security features, such as watchtowers, razor wire, surveillance systems, and guardrooms. Cross-referencing this information with other media sources, Zenz suggests that at least several hundred thousand and possibly over a million Uighurs and other Muslim minorities could have been interned for re-education. The documents, of course, never refer to the facilities as internment camps, but as education centres, or in a more accurate translation, “re-education centres”. One of them almost certainly relates to the giant site we visited - a July 2017 tender for the installation of a heating system in a “transformation through education school” somewhere in the district of Dabancheng. In these euphemisms, and in the mundane measurements and quantities described, there is the unmistakable substance of a rapidly expanding network of mass confinement. In 2002, Reyila Abulaiti travelled from Xinjiang to the UK to study. She met and married a British man, took British citizenship and started a family. Last year, her mother came for her usual summer visit, spending time with her daughter and grandson and doing a bit of London sightseeing. Xiamuxinuer Pida, 66, is a well-educated former-engineer with a long service record at a Chinese state company. Xiamuxinuer Pida She flew back to Xinjiang on 2 June. Having not heard from her, Reyila called to check she'd got home OK. The conversation was brief and terrifying. “She told me that the police were searching the house,” Reyila remembers. It was Reyila who appeared to be the target of the investigation. She needed to send copies of her documents, her mother said - proof of UK address, a copy of her British passport, her UK telephone numbers and information about her university course. Reyila Abulaiti And then, after asking her to send them via a Chinese mobile chat service, Xiamuxinuer said something that sent a chill down Reyila's spine. “Don't call me again,” her mother told her. “Don't call me ever.” It was the last time her daughter would hear her voice. She believes she has been in a camp ever since. “My mum has been detained for no reason,” she says. “As far as I know, the Chinese government wants to delete Uighur identity from the world.” The BBC has conducted lengthy interviews with eight Uighurs living overseas. Their testimonies are remarkably consistent, providing evidence of the conditions and routines inside the camps and the broad basis on which people are detained. Mainstream religious activity, the mildest dissent and any link with Uighurs living in foreign countries appear to be enough to sweep people into the system. Ablet Tursun Tohti Each morning, when 29-year-old Ablet Tursun Tohti was woken an hour before sunrise, he and his fellow detainees had one minute to get to the exercise yard. After lining up, they were made to run. “There was a special room to punish those who didn't run fast enough,” Ablet says. “There were two men there, one to beat with a belt, the other just to kick.” The exercise yard can clearly be seen on the satellite photo of the camp where he says he was held, in the oasis town of Hotan in southern Xinjiang. “We sang the song called ‘Without the Communist Party There Can Be No New China,’” Ablet says. “And they taught us laws. If you couldn't recite them in the correct way, you'd be beaten.” A 2018 satellite image showing a camp in Hotan where Ablet says he was detained He was there for a month in late 2015 and, in some ways, he is one of the lucky ones. In the early days of the internment camps, the lengths of the re-education “courses” appear to have been shorter. Over the past two years there are very few reports ofanyone being released at all. There is no-one left outside And since there has now been a mass recall of passports, Ablet was one of the last Uighurs able to leave China. He has sought refuge in Turkey, a country with a sizeable Uighur diaspora because of strong cultural and linguistic links. Ablet tells me that his 74-year-old father and eight of his siblings are in the camps. “There is no-one left outside,” he says. Abdusalam Muhemet, 41, is also now living in Turkey. He was detained by the police in Xinjiang in 2014 for reciting an Islamic verse at a funeral. They eventually decided not to charge him, he says, but he still wasn't free. Abdusalam Muhemet “They told me I needed to be educated,” he explains. The facility he found himself in did not look like a school. On the satellite photo, you can make out the guard towers and the double perimeter fencing of the Han'airike Legal Education Training Centre. The rolls of razor wire can be identified from the shadows they cast under the harsh desert sun. He describes the same routine of exercise, bullying and brainwashing. Satellite image of the site in Hotan where Abdusalam says he was held Twenty-five-year-old Ali, not his real name, is one of those too scared to talk openly. In 2015 he says he ended up in a camp after the police found a picture of woman wearing a niqab, a face veil, on his mobile phone. “One old lady was there for having made a pilgrimage to Mecca,” he tells me, “and an old man for not paying his water bill on time.” Ali (not his real name) is unwilling to be identified During one of the forced exercise sessions an official’s car entered the camp and the gate was briefly left open. “Suddenly, a small child ran in towards his mother who was running with us. “She went towards her child, embraced him and started crying. “Then a policeman grabbed the woman by her hair and dragged the small child out of the camp.” In place of clean surroundings shown on state TV, a very different picture emerges. “The doors of our dormitories were locked at night,” Ablet says. But there were no toilets inside, they just gave us a bowl.” There is no way of independently verifying these accounts. We asked the Chinese government about the allegations of abuse but have received no reply. For Uighurs outside Xinjiang news has almost completely dried up. Fear breeds silence. Reports of people being deleted from family chat groups, or told never to call again, are now commonplace. Two of the things most central to Uighur culture - faith and family - are being systematically broken. As a result of the detention of whole extended families, there are reports that many children are being placed in state orphanages. Bilkiz Hibibullah arrived in Turkey in 2016 with five of her children. Bilkiz Hibibullah Her youngest daughter, Sekine Hasan, who by now would be three and a half years old, stayed in Xinjiang with Bilkiz's husband. She did not yet have a passport and the plan was that, when she got one, the family would reunite in Istanbul. She never got that passport. Bilkiz's daughter Sekine, whom she has not seen for more than two years Bilkiz believes her husband was detained on 20 March last year. She has since lost contact with the rest of her family and now has no idea where her daughter is. “In the middle of the night, after my other children have gone to bed, I cry a lot,” she says. “There is nothing more miserable than not knowing where your daughter is, if she is alive or dead. “If she could hear me now, I'd say nothing but sorry.” Satellite image of site in Hotan enhanced by GMV Using only publicly available, open-source satellite data, it's possible to shed light on Xinjiang's dark secret. GMV is a multinational aerospace company with experience of monitoring infrastructure from space on behalf of organisations like the European Space Agency and the European Commission. Their analysts went through a list of 101 facilities located across Xinjiang - drawn up from the various media reports and academic research about the re-education camp system. One by one, they measured the growth of new sites and the expansion of existing ones. They identified and compared common features such as watchtowers and security fencing - the kind of things needed to monitor and control the movement of people. And they categorised the likelihood of each site actually being a security facility, placing 44 of them in the high or very high category. Then they plotted the first detection by satellite of each of those 44 facilities over time. Images show the extent of the building work that has taken place at part of the camp where Abdusalem Muhemet was held. GMV cannot say what the sites are being used for. But it is clear that over the past few years China has been building a lot of new security facilities, at remarkable and increasing speed. It is likely to be an underestimate of the true picture. There is a striking conclusion - the recent trend is towards larger facilities. The number of new construction projects this year has fallen when compared with 2017. However, in terms of overall surface area of the facilities being built, there is more this year than last. GMV calculates that, from this set of 44 sites alone, the surface area of secure facilities in Xinjiang has expanded by some 440 hectares since 2003. This measurement refers to the whole site within the external security walls, not just the buildings. But 440 hectares represents a lot of additional space. For context, a 14-hectare site within the city of Los Angeles – containing the Twin Towers Correctional Facility and the Men's Central Jail - holds a combined total of almost 7,000 prisoners. Twin Towers Correctional Facility, Los Angeles We took one of GMV's findings - the increase in building size at the facility in Dabancheng - and showed it to a team with long experience in prison design at the Australian-based Guymer Bailey Architects. Using the measurements from the satellite images they calculated that, at an absolute minimum, the facility could provide space for about 11,000 detainees. Even that minimum estimate would place it alongside some of the biggest prisons in the world. Riker's Island in New York, the largest in the US, has space for 10,000 prisoners. Silivri Prison outside Istanbul, often referred to as Europe's largest, is designed to house 11,000. Guymer Bailey Architects (GBA) provided us with this analysis of the possible functions of the various buildings on the site. Their minimum estimate for occupancy at Dabancheng assumes that the detainees are held only in single rooms. If dormitories were used instead then the total capacity at Dabancheng would increase dramatically, GBA suggests, with an outer limit of about 130,000. It appears as a place designed to pack as many people into as small an area as possible We also showed the images to Raphael Sperry, an architect and the president of the US-based organisation, Architects/Designers/Planners for Social Responsibility. “This is a truly massive and bleak detention facility,” he told me. “It appears as a place designed to pack as many people into as small an area as possible at the lowest construction cost. “I think 11,000 is likely a significant underestimate... From the available information we can't tell how the interior is configured or what portion of the buildings is used for detention rather than other functions. Even so, your dormitory estimate of 130,000 people seems, sadly, quite possible.” The lack of access to the site means there's no way of independently verifying this analysis. We asked the authorities in Xinjiang to confirm what the site at Dabancheng is used for but have received no response. The padlocked door to a house in the city of Kashgar Not all of Xinjiang's internment camps are the same. Yining Number 3 Middle School is now believed to be a detention centre Some of the secure facilities have not been built from scratch, but are conversions of structures previously used for other purposes, like schools or factories. These are often smaller and located closer to the centre of towns or cities. In the northern county of Yining we tried to visit a number of such camps. We'd seen local government procurement documents for a project to create five “vocational skills education training centres” for the purposes of “safeguarding stability”. In the centre of town we stop outside a large group of buildings that used to be Yining Number 3 Middle School. A high, solid blue steel fence now surrounds the site and there's heavy security on the front gate. There's a new watchtower by the playground and another one by what used to be the football pitch. The pitch is now completely covered by six long steel-roofed buildings. Outside, visiting family members are queueing up at the security check. Once again, wherever we go in the town, two or three cars follow us. When we try to get out to film at one of the camps, this one surrounded by a grey fence, we're stopped. The officials, with hands over our camera lenses, tell us that there's important military training taking place in the area today and we're instructed to leave. Outside the former school we see a family, a mother and two children, standing quietly by the fence. One of the minders tries to stop them from talking but another appears to over-rule him. “Let them speak,” she says. I ask them whom they're visiting. There's a pause, before the young boy answers, “My dad”. The hands cover our lenses once again. In the city of Kashgar, the once bustling, beating heart of Uighur culture, the narrow streets are eerily quiet. Many of the doors are padlocked shut. On one, we see a notice instructing people how to respond to questions about where their family members have gone. “Say they're being looked after for the good of society and their families,” it says. The city's main mosque is more like a museum. We try to find out when the next prayer time is but no-one seems to be able to tell us. “I'm just here to deal with tourists,” one official tells us. “I don't know anything about prayer times.” In the square, a few beardless old men sit chatting. We ask them where everyone else is. One of them gestures to his mouth, holding his lips together to signal that it's too risky for him to talk to journalists. But the other whispers: “No-one comes anymore.” A helmeted policeman, some distance away, is cleaning the mosque steps. In the silence we can hear the sound of the slop of the water in the bucket and the swish of the mop, echoing across the square. Chinese tourists are taking photos. We leave Kashgar on the highway, heading southwest towards an area dotted with Uighur villages and farms, and a great many suspected camps. We're being followed as usual but soon we run into an unexpected obstacle. Ahead of us, the highway appears to have just been closed. The police officers manning the roadblock tell us that surface of the road has melted in the hot sun. “It's not safe to proceed,” they say. We notice that the other cars are being directed into a car park in a shopping mall, and over the radio, we hear instructions to hold them there “for a while”. We're told the wait could be four or five hours and we're advised to turn around. We look for alternative routes, but another roadblock always seems to materialise, although the explanations change. One road is closed for “military training”. Four times, on four separate roads, we're turned around before we finally have to admit defeat. Just a few kilometres away lies another giant camp said to hold around 10,000 people. There are Uighurs in positions of authority in Xinjiang. Many of the government officials and police officers who tailed and stopped us were Uighurs. If they feel in any way conflicted they cannot say it of course. A wall poster in Xinjiang reads: “Stability is a blessing, instability is a calamity” But while the system of profiling and control has been likened by some to Apartheid, clearly that is not entirely accurate. Many Uighurs do have a stake in the system. In reality a better parallel can be found in China's own totalitarian past. As in the Cultural Revolution, a society is being told that it needs to be taken apart in order to be saved. Shohrat Zakir, a Uighur and, in theory, the second most powerful politician in the region, suggests the battle has almost been won. Shohrat Zakir is the chairman of Xinjiang province and an ethnic Uighur “In the past 21 months, no violent terrorist attacks have occurred and the number of criminal cases, including those endangering public security, has dropped significantly,” he is reported to have told state media. “Xinjiang is not only beautiful but also safe and stable.” But when the detainees are released, what then? The former camp inmates we spoke to were all burning with resentment. And the world has yet to hear from anyone who has spent time in facilities like Dabancheng, the sinister and secretive facility of such immense proportions. Our reporting adds to the evidence that the mass re-education programme is internment by any other name - the locking up of many thousands of Muslims without trial or charge, in fact with no access to any legal process at all. China is already proclaiming it to be a success. But history holds many troubling precedents about where such a project might end up. Built with Shorthand"
Gourmet Burger Kitchen seeks rescue deal,"Gourmet Burger Kitchen (GBK) says it has earmarked 17 restaurants for closure after running up millions of pounds of losses. The chain, owned by South Africa's Famous Brands, has filed for a Company Voluntary Arrangement - an insolvency process that allows struggling firms to close unprofitable stores. It warned 250 jobs were at risk under the plan, which still needs approval. GBK operates about 80 restaurants in the UK and employs 2,000 people. Earlier this month, Famous Brands said GBK had booked a Â£47m loss amid tough trading conditions. Managing director Derrian Nadauld said the chain faced a ""challenging casual dining"" market and its rental payments were too high. ""We are having to take tough but necessary actions to reduce our fixed cost base and restore long-term profitability,"" he said. ""This [CVA] will provide greater security for our staff, suppliers, landlords and customers."" Pizza chain Prezzo to close 94 outlets Byron outlets to close in rescue plan Under the terms of the process, which is being run by Grant Thornton, GBK could close 17 restaurants, although it said every effort would be made to redeploy staff. Its other 68 restaurants would continue to trade as normal and no outlets will close immediately. The burger chain is the latest in a long line of casual dining firms to announce store closures this year. Gaucho, Hummus Bros, Prezzo, Byron and Jamie's Italian have all fallen on hard times as consumer confidence has slumped, leaving brands with unsustainable overheads. Matthew Richards, a director at Grant Thornton, said: ""The casual dining trading environment in the UK remains extremely challenging, driven by a change in dining behaviour, long-term consumer trends and increased competition."" He said GBK's CVA would provide a ""stable platform"" on which management could turn the business around.

May 'wins over' Tory Brexit critics,"Theresa May has been applauded by Tory MPs after making a ""heartfelt"" appeal for unity over Brexit and urging her critics to get behind her. The prime minister has been addressing all her MPs in Parliament, many of whom are seeking a change of approach. Asked by one MP what concessions she had made to the EU, she set out areas where the EU had itself given ground. Former minister Amber Rudd said the PM ""won the room"" while another MP said it was a ""petting zoo, not a lion's den"". May: 'Be careful about language' on Brexit Brexit plan to safeguard medicine supplies Queen looks to 'new partnership' with Europe Guide: Rules for any challenge to Theresa May The sound of desks and doors being thumped could be heard coming from the Commons room where the 1922 committee - an elected body of MPs which represents backbenchers and also oversees leadership contests - met privately.

Comments by unnamed Tory MPs over the weekend suggested the PM would be fighting for her political life at the meeting and was on the edge of the ""killing zone"". However, Tory MP Michael Fabricant told journalists waiting outside that the atmosphere inside the meeting was ""not a lion's den but a petting zoo"". Attorney General Geoffrey Cox said the PM's remarks were ""very good"" while former home secretary Amber Rudd said Mrs May ""was able to win the room, despite being frank about difficulties still there"". ""She looked like she really meant it,"" she told the BBC. ""It felt heartfelt."" And Basildon MP John Baron said ""the mood was, let's get behind the PM and get this over the line"". But not all MPs were happy, one suggesting the odds of her surviving another week were 50:50 while another said what mattered was the mood in the party not orchestrated shows of support.

Mrs May is reported to have told MPs that she had won a number of concessions from the EU, including the role of the European Court of Justice in enforcing the rights of EU citizens in the UK. She also rejected suggestions that her top European adviser, Olly Robbins, was ""freelancing"" when the UK agreed to consider extending the post-Brexit transition period beyond 2020. Talks on the UK's exit from the EU are said to be 95% complete, but have stalled over the Irish border issue. The UK prime minister has said that having the option of extending the transition could provide the ""safety net"" or ""backstop"" needed to guarantee no new visible border checks where Northern Ireland meets the Republic. But her plans have come in for criticism among Tory ranks, with a social media campaign called ""Standup4Brexit"" claiming to have 50 MPs backing its call for Mrs May to ""chuck"" her current strategy. The prime minister has said any temporary measure used to avoid a hard border would have to end by the next general election, which is due in 2022. At the weekend, anonymous quotes about Mrs May in the Sunday newspapers sparked a backlash from MPs of all parties. The Sunday Times quoted a Tory backbencher saying: ""The moment is coming when the knife gets heated, stuck in her front and twisted. She'll be dead soon."" Another said she should ""bring her own noose"" to the 1922 Committee meeting. Tory MPs said those behind the quotes were ""spineless cowards"" who should be thrown out of the party. This video can not be played In full: European Parliament president v Nigel Farage Meanwhile, EU politicians in Strasbourg have been debating Brexit, with European Council President Donald Tusk saying more time was needed to find a solution. ""Therefore, there is no other way but to continue the talks,"" he told MEPs. Mr Tusk said Mrs May had mentioned the option of extending the transition period planned after Brexit, saying that if it helped reach a deal, ""I'm sure that the leaders would be ready to consider it positively"". Irish Sinn Fein MEP Lynn Boylan said the UK government was trying to ""understate"" the issue of the Irish border, and is ""yet to understand"" a deal cannot be reached without agreement on an Irish backstop. And Spanish MEP Esteban Gonzalez Pons called for an extension of the transition phase to allow time for a second, ""definitive"", referendum. But former UKIP leader Nigel Farage blamed the UK civil service for the delays in reaching a deal, saying senior officials were ""out to sabotage Brexit"".

Court stops Telegraph 'harassment' story,"A ""leading businessman"" has won a legal battle to stop a newspaper printing harassment claims against him. Three Court of Appeal judges granted an injunction to stop the Daily Telegraph publishing its article. The judges say the five staff making the claims had been ""compromised by settlement agreements"" and had received ""substantial"" payouts to stay silent. Theresa May would not comment directly on the case, but said some companies used such agreements ""unethically"". Mrs May said non-disclosure agreements, or NDAs, should not silence whistle blowers. She added the government would take action to make sure employees knew their rights. A Labour MP said NDAs were being used by the rich and powerful to do ""whatever they wanted"". The Telegraph's editorsaid the public ""have a right to know when the powerful seek to gag the vulnerable"",external. The '#MeToo claims which cannot be revealed' The paper said it spenteight months investigating allegations of bullying, intimidation and sexual harassment made against the businessman,external. It said publishing the allegations would ""be sure to reignite the #MeToo movement against the mistreatment of women, minorities and others by powerful employers"". But after the accused boss was contacted for comment by the paper in July, he and a number of his senior staff applied for an injunction to stop the details being published. In August, a High Court judge refused to grant the gagging order. Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said the information was ""clearly capable of significantly contributing to a debate in a democratic society"" and ""making a contribution to a current debate of general public interest on misconduct in the workplace"". But the executive and his managers appealed the decision, saying details of the allegations had been ""disclosed in breach of confidence"" as the five staff had signed NDAs. On Tuesday, the Appeal Court judges - Sir Terence Etherton, Lord Justice Underhill and Lord Justice Henderson - published a ruling in the businessman's favour. It mentioned allegations of ""discreditable conduct"", but said the paper was aware of NDAs signed by the accusers, in which they agreed to keep the details ""confidential"". It was therefore prevented from publishing them. This video can not be played Is it ok that ""people with money are effectively able to gag claims of wrong doing against them?"" asks Camilla Tominey on Radio 4's World at One The Telegraph said the ruling made it ""illegal to reveal the businessman's identity or to identify the companies, as well as what he is accused of doing or how much he paid his alleged victims"" pending a full hearing early next year. The paper said NDAs were used in business to protect commercial confidentiality but there are concerns they are being abused to conceal wrongdoing and deter victims of potential crimes from going to police. During prime minister's questions on Wednesday, Mrs May declined to comment directly on the court's decision. However, she said: ""Non-disclosure agreements cannot stop people from whistle blowing, but it is clear that some employers are using them unethically. She added that the government would consult on whether the regulation around non-disclosure agreements could be improved, so employers and employees were aware when a NDA did not apply or could not be enforced. Labour MP Jess Phillips told the Commons: ""It seems that our laws allow rich and powerful men to pretty much do whatever they want as long as they can pay to keep it quiet."" Theresa May spoke about NDAs at prime minister's questions By Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondent The Harvey Weinstein scandal and the #MeToo movement put the spotlight on the use and abuse of non-disclosure agreements by powerful individuals. The concerns have reached parliament, with the Women and Equalities Committee saying they were ""used unfairly by someâ¦ to silence victims of sexual harassment"". But this case is different. The Court of Appeal made it clear that there was no evidence any of the NDAs resulted from bullying, harassment or undue pressure, and each employee received independent legal advice before entering into them. Also, two of the staff who made the accusations against the businessman supported the injunction. This may seem odd but it's not unusual, as some people, even victims, don't want a problem at work to follow them afterwards. NDAs are just contracts. If they are entered into freely, with proper legal advice, the courts are loathe to unpick them. The ones used by powerful rich people to gag alleged victims are an area of massive concern, but this does not appear to be a good example of that kind of abuse. It is likely we are going to see a lot more of these type of cases though, as the press will continue to drive on and fight where they believe there is a public interest in going behind an NDA.

Designer admits baby choke death failure,"Craig Williams had denied manslaughter and fraud in relation to Oscar Abbey's death A designer has admitted a health and safety failing after a seven-month-old baby ""choked to death"" in a cot bed. Oscar Abbey was found by his parents, caught in the side of his bed at their home in York on 3 November 2016. He had got his head stuck while trying to crawl through a gap in the cot sold by Craig Williams's Playtime Beds Ltd. Williams, 37, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, pleaded guilty at Leeds Crown Court to failing to discharge the employer's general duty. Charlie and Shannon Abbey had paid Â£655 including delivery costs for the cot bed, which featured a slide, from the firm owned by Williams. Jurors heard the couple were told by the designer the bed was suitable for children aged six or seven months and their son first started using it on 28 October 2016. In a statement read during the trial, Mrs Abbey, 23, said: ""At no point was I advised that it was not suitable."" Oscar Abbey died of positional asphyxia after he got his head stuck, the court heard On the night of Oscar's death, prosecutor John Elvidge QC, had told the court: ""He wriggled his body through the holes at the front of his cot bed. ""His head was too big to fit through. ""In effect, he choked to death. He was starved of oxygen."" More news from Yorkshire Mr Abbey, 24, said in his statement he found his son trapped face-down in the front of the cot. ""It looked like he'd tried to crawl out backwards but his head was stuck,"" he said. Mrs Abbey also described how she woke up and heard her husband ""shouting and screaming: 'He's not breathing'. ""I ran to the landing and Charlie was holding Oscar in both arms,"" she said. Mr Elvidge told the court Playtime Beds Ltd had received a complaint in March 2016 from a customer saying the bed she bought did not meet standards. But Williams told the customer: ""I have been in touch with trading standards and they are happy with my products,"" the prosecutor said. Mr Elvidge said the trading standards office had no record of contact from the defendant. The court heard Williams continued to make beds and did not alter his designs even after Oscar's death. ""Maybe the only reasonable inference to be drawn is that he didn't care at all about the fate of those using his beds,"" said Mr Elvidge. Sheffield-based company Playtime Beds Ltd made bespoke MDF beds in various shapes. As Williams had admitted a charge under the Health and Safety at Work Act the jury was asked to return a not guilty verdict to gross negligence manslaughter. Williams, of Park View Road, Kimberworth, also pleaded guilty to fraud. He is due to be sentenced on Friday alongside employee Joseph Bruce, 30, of Kimberworth Park Road, Rotherham, who also admitted the same charge. Bruce had been purported to be running a new bed company set up following Oscar's death, but that was still Williams' firm.

Armed robbers steal eight puppies,"The robbers took the day-old puppies from a home in Stretford, Greater Manchester Knife-wielding robbers stole eight French bulldog puppies from a home after threatening a pregnant mother and her children. The men seized the day-old puppies from their 26-year-old owner at the home in Stretford, Greater Manchester. Two or three men are thought to have been involved, using a knife to scare the woman and her three young children on Tuesday night. Pedigree French bulldog puppies can sell for more than Â£1,000 each. Greater Manchester Police have released CCTV and appealed for anyone with information about the ""terrifying"" robbery to contact the force. Det Sgt Dave Jones said: ""It's completely shocking that a pregnant woman and her three young children have faced such a terrifying ordeal, and we are determined to find the men responsible. ""The puppies are only a day old, and they won't survive for long without their mum, so they need to be brought home as soon as possible."" Police released CCTV which shows two of the suspects The family were unhurt and dialled 999 after the men fled. It is thought they drove up in a car before knocking on the door at 21:50 GMT. The mother answered the door before the men forced their way in, GMP said. They demanded cash and mobile phones before stealing the puppies. Det Sgt Jones added: ""As well as finding the offenders, an immediate priority is to find these puppies. Two men are thought to have burst into the house, with a possible third man acting as a getaway driver ""I need anyone with information about the whereabouts of the puppies, or the men responsible, to please contact police as a matter of urgency."" The RSPCA said French bulldog puppies sell for ""at least Â£1,200"" but can cost ""far more"". A spokeswoman added: ""They need very intensive looking after with bottle feeding and warm conditions.

"May 'wins over' Tory Brexit criticsA meeting of backbenchers was more of a ""petting zoo than a lion's den"", one MP says.UK Politics","Theresa May has been applauded by Tory MPs after making a ""heartfelt"" appeal for unity over Brexit and urging her critics to get behind her. The prime minister has been addressing all her MPs in Parliament, many of whom are seeking a change of approach. Asked by one MP what concessions she had made to the EU, she set out areas where the EU had itself given ground. Former minister Amber Rudd said the PM ""won the room"" while another MP said it was a ""petting zoo, not a lion's den"". May: 'Be careful about language' on Brexit Brexit plan to safeguard medicine supplies Queen looks to 'new partnership' with Europe Guide: Rules for any challenge to Theresa May The sound of desks and doors being thumped could be heard coming from the Commons room where the 1922 committee - an elected body of MPs which represents backbenchers and also oversees leadership contests - met privately.

Comments by unnamed Tory MPs over the weekend suggested the PM would be fighting for her political life at the meeting and was on the edge of the ""killing zone"". However, Tory MP Michael Fabricant told journalists waiting outside that the atmosphere inside the meeting was ""not a lion's den but a petting zoo"". Attorney General Geoffrey Cox said the PM's remarks were ""very good"" while former home secretary Amber Rudd said Mrs May ""was able to win the room, despite being frank about difficulties still there"". ""She looked like she really meant it,"" she told the BBC. ""It felt heartfelt."" And Basildon MP John Baron said ""the mood was, let's get behind the PM and get this over the line"". But not all MPs were happy, one suggesting the odds of her surviving another week were 50:50 while another said what mattered was the mood in the party not orchestrated shows of support.

Mrs May is reported to have told MPs that she had won a number of concessions from the EU, including the role of the European Court of Justice in enforcing the rights of EU citizens in the UK. She also rejected suggestions that her top European adviser, Olly Robbins, was ""freelancing"" when the UK agreed to consider extending the post-Brexit transition period beyond 2020. Talks on the UK's exit from the EU are said to be 95% complete, but have stalled over the Irish border issue. The UK prime minister has said that having the option of extending the transition could provide the ""safety net"" or ""backstop"" needed to guarantee no new visible border checks where Northern Ireland meets the Republic. But her plans have come in for criticism among Tory ranks, with a social media campaign called ""Standup4Brexit"" claiming to have 50 MPs backing its call for Mrs May to ""chuck"" her current strategy. The prime minister has said any temporary measure used to avoid a hard border would have to end by the next general election, which is due in 2022. At the weekend, anonymous quotes about Mrs May in the Sunday newspapers sparked a backlash from MPs of all parties. The Sunday Times quoted a Tory backbencher saying: ""The moment is coming when the knife gets heated, stuck in her front and twisted. She'll be dead soon."" Another said she should ""bring her own noose"" to the 1922 Committee meeting. Tory MPs said those behind the quotes were ""spineless cowards"" who should be thrown out of the party. This video can not be played In full: European Parliament president v Nigel Farage Meanwhile, EU politicians in Strasbourg have been debating Brexit, with European Council President Donald Tusk saying more time was needed to find a solution. ""Therefore, there is no other way but to continue the talks,"" he told MEPs. Mr Tusk said Mrs May had mentioned the option of extending the transition period planned after Brexit, saying that if it helped reach a deal, ""I'm sure that the leaders would be ready to consider it positively"". Irish Sinn Fein MEP Lynn Boylan said the UK government was trying to ""understate"" the issue of the Irish border, and is ""yet to understand"" a deal cannot be reached without agreement on an Irish backstop. And Spanish MEP Esteban Gonzalez Pons called for an extension of the transition phase to allow time for a second, ""definitive"", referendum. But former UKIP leader Nigel Farage blamed the UK civil service for the delays in reaching a deal, saying senior officials were ""out to sabotage Brexit"".

Commons accepts bullying recommendationsThe House of Commons Commission backs independent handling of complaints and wider cultural changes.UK Politics,"The Commons authorities have accepted the recommendations of a report that said bullying and harassment had been ""tolerated and concealed"". The Commons Commission backed setting up an independent body to investigate complaints, including historical ones. Commons Speaker John Bercow, who has faced calls to quit, said it was the first step in a ""root and branch reform"" of parliamentary culture. Unions representing Commons staff said it was a ""ground-breaking"" moment. Dame Laura Cox's report had criticised a culture of ""silence"" in the Commons in response to widespread cases of inappropriate touching, lewd language and intimidating behaviour. Welcoming the commission's decision, which still has to be approved by the House as a whole, cabinet minister Andrea Leadsom called for changes to the management of the Commons to make it ""more democratic and accountable"". Mr Bercow stepped aside from his usual role of chairing the commission for the meeting. Bullying report goes to 'conflicted' commission 'Radical change' needed after Commons bullying Speaking afterwards, he confirmed the body - which is made up of Tory, Labour, Lib Dem and SNP MPs as well Commons officials and lay members - had accepted all the report's recommendations. These include an ""entirely independent process"" to handle complaints against MPs and the removal of a cut-off date, so historical allegations can be included. This video can not be played John Bercow said last week a new body was needed to investigate bullying Existing workplace respect policies which have been discredited by the findings of the Cox report are to be discontinued. ""I'm delighted that every member of the commission has decided to support fully the three main recommendations from Dame Laura Cox's report, which I believe are an important first step in our root and branch reform of the culture of this House,"" Mr Bercow said. ""Specifically, I am very keen to see the establishment of an independent body to hear and adjudicate on all allegations of bullying, harassment and sexual misconduct as soon as possible."" Mr Bercow - who as Speaker is the highest authority in the House of Commons - is himself facing bullying accusations, which he denies. These, in theory, could now be examined under the new procedures. Although Dame Laura did not investigate individual cases, she said highly-placed figures should consider whether they could change the culture in Parliament and, if not, ""consider their position"". Mrs Leadsom, the leader of the House of Commons, said it was vital that the external members of the commission, led by health and housing expert Jane McCall, were in charge of implementing the recommendations and not MPs. ""We are determined to allow for historic allegations to be both investigated and acted upon and for there to be independence in the sanctioning of Members of Parliament,"" she said. The First Division Association, which represents Commons staff, said it was the ""first step to ending the toxic culture of deference and silence that has allowed bullying, harassment and sexual harassment to thrive"".

Who is billionaire financier George Soros?,"The billionaire financier has become a divisive figure in global politics in recent years Hungarian-American businessman George Soros is one of the world's most renowned, and philanthropic, financial investors. Earning his fortune through shrewd financial speculation, he has spent billions of his own money funding human rights projects and liberal democratic ventures around the world. In recent years, that funding has made him a target of the world's nationalists and populists, who have painted him as a master-manipulator of democracy. Much of the criticism aimed toward the 87-year-old has been criticised as having anti-Semitic undertones. Born in 1930 in Budapest to a Jewish lawyer father, he and his family survived Hungarian Nazi-occupation by splitting up and acquiring forged papers that disguised their religion. He emigrated to England aged 17, achieving an undergraduate degree and PhD from the London School of Economics (LSE) while working part-time as a railway porter and nightclub waiter. Soros warns EU faces 'existential crisis' Facebook and Google criticised by George Soros While there, he studied under philosopher Karl Popper, who is best known for his rallying cry for Western liberal democracy in the post-war years. His concept of ""open society"" would be deeply influential on Mr Soros's ideology and financial career. After initially working in investment banking in London, he emigrated to the United States in 1956. He spent time at several firms in New York, before founding his own hedge fund in 1970. Soros Fund Management, which would eventually become the Quantum Fund, was known for its aggressive investment and high returns for investors. The firm gained notoriety for its short-term and flexible speculation on global financial markets. This success made Mr Soros one of the world's wealthiest men and cemented him as a legend within the investment market. He became known ""the man who broke the Bank of England"" in September 1992, when he made about Â£1bn betting against or ""shorting"" the UK's currency, the pound. On 16 September, a day dubbed ""Black Wednesday"", the Treasury rapidly lost billions in reserves,  forcing the pound out of the European Exchange Rate Mechanism (ERM). This video can not be played Peter Jay reports on the day that became know as Black Wednesday This investment gamble is probably Mr Soros's best known, consolidating his reputation as the world's premier currency investor. His financial single-mindedness later led to accusations that he had helped to engineer the Asian financial crisis of 1997 when the Thai baht collapsed, triggering widespread financial contagion across the region. At the time, Malaysian Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad hit out at ""unscrupulous profiteers"" and called for ""immoral"" currency trading to be banned. Mr Soros drew his ire in particular, but other investors had made even heavier bets against the Thai currency than his firm had. The hedge fund manager began to ease away from the day-to-day control of his firm during the 1980s and 1990s, paying more and more attention to philanthropic ventures instead. Since starting out offering scholarships to black students during the apartheid era in South Africa, he has spent billions supporting progressive free-market projects around the world. His foundation is now the second-largest philanthropic organisation in the US - behind that of Microsoft founder Bill Gates He focused on opening up cultural exchange with Eastern Europe during the collapse of communism, before widening investment to other regions around the world. Mr Soros's Open Society Foundations (OSF) now has programmes in more than 100 countries around the world, and 37 regional offices. The organisation says its focus is to build ""vibrant and tolerant democracies whose governments are accountable and open to the participation of all people"". Soros foundation to leave Hungary In 2017, while he was ranked as the 29th wealthiest person in the world by Forbes magazine, it emerged that he had transferred $18bn (Â£13.5bn) or an estimated 80% of his personal wealth into the organisation. According to his website, his goal is to use his financial independence to fight some of the world's ""most intractable problems"". The OSF continues to support a number of human-rights initiatives around the world, including campaigns in favour of LGBT and Roma rights. Mr Soros has remained extremely vocal about world economics and global politics. This has drawn flak from 21st Century nationalist politicians, who have depicted him as a left-wing bogeyman of sorts. In Europe,he openly criticised the handling of the euro debt crisis, while during the peak of the region's refugee crisis he pledged generous backing for aid groups supporting migrants. Hungary: country profile Long read: Who is Viktor Orban? This policy in particular has set him on a collision course with Prime Minister Viktor Orban in his native country. The Hungarian government even funded the distribution of giant posters vilifying the financier in 2017. Mr Soros' foundation eventually decided to withdraw its offices from Hungary,blaming an ""increasingly repressive"" environment. Hungary's largest Jewish organisation labelled the propaganda campaign as ""poisonous"" His foundation has also donated hundreds of thousands of pounds to the Best for Britain group, which aims to halt the UK's departure from the EU. This support has made him a focus of criticism for pro-Brexit supporters, campaigners and newspapers within the country. In 2015, the foundation was banned in Russia, which labelled it as ""undesirable"" because of its perceived risk to Russian security and constitutional order. Mr Soros has been a large donor to the US Democratic Party. He backed the presidential campaigns of Barack Obama and Hillary Clinton, andhas also labelled US President Donald Trump ""an imposter"". US-based right-wing conspiracy theorists and websites have accused Mr Soros of secretly engineering a range of recent events in US and global politics. They have alleged that he was involved in recruiting crowds for the anti-Trump Women's March and even organising violence in Charlottesville to undermine the country's political right-wing. Such conspiracies, and negative coverage of his foundation's work, are often accused of being anti-Semitic, echoing Nazi-era conspiracy theories about Jewish bankers plotting to create a ""new world order"". George Soros has been married three times. He had two sons and a daughter with his first wife, German-born Annaliese Witschak, whom he married in 1960. The pair divorced in 1983, when he then wed second wife Susan Weber. The pair stayed together until 2005, having two sons during their marriage. He married third wife Tamiko Bolton - 42 years his junior - in 2013. Away from hedge funds and philanthropy, Mr Soros has also dabbled with investing in sports teams around the world. In 2012, it was reported that he had purchased a significant minority stake in UK-based football team Manchester United.

Explosive device found in Soros post box,"Mr Soros was reportedly not at home at the time of Monday's incident A suspect package found in a post box at the home of billionaire businessman George Soros contained an explosive device, New York police have confirmed. The item was discovered on Monday by an employee of Mr Soros, who took it to a nearby wooded area, where it was later destroyed by bomb squad officers. The incident is being investigated by the FBI's Joint Terrorism Task Force. Mr Soros has become a frequent target for criticism by right-wing groups due to his support for liberal causes. Mr Soros was not at his home in the town of Bedford in Westchester County at the time of the incident, according to reports. ""An employee of the residence opened the package, revealing what appeared to be an explosive device,"" a Bedford Police Department official told the New York Times.

Man held for Trump powder letter threat,"Daniel Frisiello, 24 A 24-year-old Massachusetts man has been arrested for sending a white powder to Donald Trump Jr's home, leading to his wife's hospitalisation. The letter, which was found to contain harmless corn starch, included a profanity-filled rant against the eldest son of the US president. Daniel Frisiello was arrested while on his way to work on Thursday, prosecutors say. He is also accused of sending similar letters to four other people. ""These kinds of hoaxes may not cause physical harm but they scare the heck out of people,"" said US Attorney Andrew Lelling, in a statement announcing the 10 charges against Mr Frisiello. ""These hoaxes are easy to pull off - all you need is an envelope, a stamp and a white powdery substance."" ""So you'll see this office aggressively pursue these kinds of cases,"" Mr Lelling added. Mrs Trump Jr was briefly hospitalised following the hoax threat Mr Frisiello is accused of multiple charges of posting threats and committing hoaxes. According to officers, Mr Frisiello lives with his parents and works for the Catholic Charities at a childcare centre, but has now been placed on leave. On his Facebook page, he identifies himself as a Democrat. Authorities say the suspect also sent similar letters around the country, including to the office of Senator Debbie Stabenow, a Michigan Democrat. Another alleged target was Antonio Sabato Jr, a former soap star and model who is running as a Republican for a congressional seat in California. All of the letters appeared to target public officials who had recently been featured in US news reports. The letter sent to the Manhattan apartment owned by Mr Trump Jr, 40, was opened by his wife Vanessa Trump, 40, on 12 February. She called police to report that she was coughing and felt nauseous, and first responders decontaminated her at the scene before transporting her to hospital. ""You are an awful, awful person. I am surprised that your father lets you speak on TV,"" the letter read, prosecutors say. ""You the family idiot. Eric looks smart,"" it continued, referred to Mr Trump Jr's younger brother.

Facebook removes 8.7m child nudity images,"Facebook said almost all of the images were taken down before they were reported by users Facebook has said that 8.7 million images of child nudity were removed by its moderators in just three months. The social network said that it had developed new software to automatically flag possible sexualised images of children. It was put into service last year but has only become public now. Another program can also detect possible instances of child grooming related to sexual exploitation, Facebook said. Of the 8.7 million images removed, 99% were taken down before any Facebook user had reported them, the social network said. Last year, Facebook washeavily criticised by the chairman of the Commons media committee, Damian Collins, over the prevalence of child sexual abuse material on the platform. This followed a BBC investigation in 2016, whichfound evidence that paedophiles were sharingobscene images of children via secret Facebook groups. This video can not be played The BBC reported a series of images to Facebook Now, Facebook's global head of safety Antigone Davis has said that Facebook is considering rolling out systems for spotting child nudity and grooming to Instagram as well. A separate system is used to block child sexual abuse imagery which has previously been reported to authorities. ""Recently, our engineers have been focused on classifiers to actually prevent unknown images, new images,"" Ms Davis saidin an online video about the technology,external. Such newly discovered material is reported by Facebook to the National Center for Missing and Exploited Children (NCMEC). ""What Facebook hasn't told us is how many potentially inappropriate accounts it knows about, or how it's identifying which accounts could be responsible for grooming and abusing children"" said Tony Stower, head of child safety online for the NSPCC. ""And let's be clear, police have told us that Facebook-owned apps are being used by groomers to target children."" Mr Stower called for mandatory transparency reports from social networks which would detail the ""full extent"" of harms faced by children on their websites. He added that regulation was needed to ensure effective grooming prevention online.

Ross from Friends: 'I didn't steal beer'David Schwimmer clears himself in a video after Blackpool police hunt for actor's thieving lookalike.Lancashire,"This video can not be played The one with the doppelganger: Many thought the suspect (left) bore a striking resemblance to David Schwimmer A UK police force's search for a Ross Geller ""lookalike"" thief must go on after the real star cleared his name in a social media video. Officers in Blackpoolshared the CCTVstill of the man, dubbed the ""spitting image"" of Friends actor David Schwimmer, clutching a crate of beer. Schwimmer responded to jokes posted onBlackpool Police's Facebook post,externalwith the video on Wednesday. He wished officers hunting the double ""good luck with the investigation"". In thevideo posted to Twitter and Instagram,external, the star is seen furtively glancing at a camera as he walks through a convenience store clutching cans of beer. ""Officers, I swear it wasn't me,"" says the accompanying post. ""As you can see, I was in New York. ""To the hardworking Blackpool Police, good luck with the investigation."" Police had earlier confirmed Schwimmer was not in the UK at the time of the offence, but the original post has descended into something of a Friends quote-fest, attracting 133,000 comments referencing the show. People made plenty of Friends gags on the police's Facebook page ""I don't think it's been this guy's day, his week, his month or even his year,"" wrote Nick Croston, while Olly Byrne quipped: ""I'm suprised you've not found him... it's like you're always stuck in second gear."" Others, such as Joe Richardson, riffed on some of Ross's most well-known quotes. ""Shouldn't he be at work...or is he on a break?"", asked Joe. While Jay Murdoch wrote: ""Apparently the police had him cornered then he performed a pivot manoeuvre and escaped."" Craig Thompson added: ""I saw him behind me in the shop around that time.. just as I was paying for MY SANDWICH."" Scottish police also got in on the act, with bobbies in Dumfries and Galloway sharing the post and warning members of the public to ""keep away"" from the suspect. ""He is known to have studied Karate and we believe he has mastered the art of Unagi, the state of total awareness,"" they wrote. Could he BE any more innocent? Police said the real Schwimmer was not in the UK at the time of the offence However, some commentators reminded their fellow Friends fans that a real-life crime had been committed. ""He's a thief and it's serious,"" wrote Grace Higham.  ""But these comments are hilarious.""

Police released the CCTV image of the suspect buying beer from a shop. Schwimmer starred in Friends from 1994 until its finale in 2004.

Gourmet Burger Kitchen seeks rescue dealThe burger chain plans to close 17 stores after running up millions of pounds of losses.Business,"Gourmet Burger Kitchen (GBK) says it has earmarked 17 restaurants for closure after running up millions of pounds of losses. The chain, owned by South Africa's Famous Brands, has filed for a Company Voluntary Arrangement - an insolvency process that allows struggling firms to close unprofitable stores. It warned 250 jobs were at risk under the plan, which still needs approval. GBK operates about 80 restaurants in the UK and employs 2,000 people. Earlier this month, Famous Brands said GBK had booked a Â£47m loss amid tough trading conditions. Managing director Derrian Nadauld said the chain faced a ""challenging casual dining"" market and its rental payments were too high. ""We are having to take tough but necessary actions to reduce our fixed cost base and restore long-term profitability,"" he said. ""This [CVA] will provide greater security for our staff, suppliers, landlords and customers."" Pizza chain Prezzo to close 94 outlets Byron outlets to close in rescue plan Under the terms of the process, which is being run by Grant Thornton, GBK could close 17 restaurants, although it said every effort would be made to redeploy staff. Its other 68 restaurants would continue to trade as normal and no outlets will close immediately. The burger chain is the latest in a long line of casual dining firms to announce store closures this year. Gaucho, Hummus Bros, Prezzo, Byron and Jamie's Italian have all fallen on hard times as consumer confidence has slumped, leaving brands with unsustainable overheads. Matthew Richards, a director at Grant Thornton, said: ""The casual dining trading environment in the UK remains extremely challenging, driven by a change in dining behaviour, long-term consumer trends and increased competition."" He said GBK's CVA would provide a ""stable platform"" on which management could turn the business around.

Prince due to speak amid Khashoggi furore,"The Saudis have previously denied accusations that the prince himself had a role in the killing The Saudi crown prince has vowed to punish all the ""culprits"" responsible for the murder of writer Jamal Khashoggi in Turkey. Speaking at a business forum in Riyadh, Mohammed bin Salman said ""the crime was painful to all Saudis"" but he would never allow any rift with Turkey. The Saudis have previously denied accusations that the prince, the de facto ruler, had a role in the killing. Khashoggi died during a 2 October visit to the Saudi consulate in Istanbul. The Saudi government has blamed the murder on ""rogue agents"". All you need to know about Khashoggi's death Who's who in the 'hit squad'? Who was the victim? Turkish President Recep Tayyip Erdogan says the journalist, a prominent critic of the government, was the victim of a carefully planned ""political murder"" by Saudi intelligence officers and other officials. These were his first public comments since the Saudis admitted Khashoggi had been killed at the consulate. Mohammed bin Salman, the power behind the throne He said the killing was ""a heinous crime that cannot be justified"" and vowed that ""those behind this crime will be held accountable... in the end justice will prevail"". He said there had been good co-operation with Turkey, adding: ""A lot of people are trying to seize this painful situation to create a rift between Saudi Arabia and Turkey. And I want to send them a message: you will never be able to do that. ""The rift will never be there."" Is this the end of Saudi prince's honeymoon? The journalist who vanished into a consulate The three-day conference, called the Future Investment Initiative but dubbed ""Davos in the desert"" after the Swiss forum, is important for the Saudis but has already been boycotted by many Western business leaders and politicians. The Saudi crown prince met Khashoggi's son, Salah, in Riyadh on Tuesday The Saudis have tried to portray business as usual at the forum, although Energy Minister Khalid al-Falih acknowledged on Tuesday there was a ""crisis"" over the Khashoggi issue. On Tuesday the crown prince joined his father, King Salman, in meeting members of the Khashoggi family. The crown prince, 33, is considered the de facto ruler of the world's leading oil exporter. He has won some plaudits for reform, but also heavy criticism for the handling of Yemen and Qatar - and even calls to be replaced after the Khashoggi affair, amid suspicion of how much he was involved. BBC's Sebastian Usher in Riyadh It was a subject that could not be avoided. The moderator cleared his throat and asked the crown prince what he had to say. The prince declared his own and his country's revulsion at what happened. He then said that many people were trying to exploit the affair to drive a wedge between Saudi Arabia and Turkey. At the end, a now relaxed and laughing Mohammed bin Salman even made a joke about the man sitting beside him - Lebanese PM Saad Hariri, who a year ago announced his resignation during a visit to Riyadh, reportedly after facing huge pressure from the prince. The prince quipped that Mr Hariri planned to stay a couple more days in Saudi Arabia, but that he wasn't being kidnapped. If the reaction of the audience was anything to go by, the crown prince scored a PR triumph. But it's the outside world that matters - and its judgement is likely to be harsher, questioning whether the prince has really faced up to the huge challenge to his and his country's credibility and trustworthiness. The key issue is the body, of which there is still no sign. The latest focus appears to be on a well in the garden of the Saudi consulate building. Why Saudi Arabia matters to the West What is Turkey's game with Saudi Arabia? What business does the UK do with Saudi Arabia? As with much of the investigation there have been conflicting reports. The Anadolu agency initially reported the Saudis had denied permission for it to be searched, only for broadcaster NTV to say later that permission had been given. On Tuesday there were similar conflicting reports over whether Khashoggi's belongings had been found in suitcases in a Saudi diplomatic car. Mr Erdogan has said Turkey has strong evidence the journalist was killed in a premeditated and ""savage"" murder and has called for the suspects to be tried in Istanbul. The Wall Street Journal published what appears to be his strongest criticism of the Saudi government to date. This video can not be played The US President criticises Saudi Arabia's handling of Jamal Khashoggi's death When asked about responsibility, Mr Trump said: ""Well, the prince is running things over there more so at this stage. He's running things and so if anybody were going to be, it would be him."" Earlier he said: ""They had a very bad original concept, it was carried out poorly and the cover-up was the worst in the history of cover-ups."" The US has vowed to revoke the visas of those believed responsible for Khashoggi's killing - Saudi Arabia says 18 Saudi nationals have been detained - but Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the punishment would not stop there. On Wednesday, UK Prime Minister Theresa May followed suit, sayinganyone suspected of involvement in the killing would be barred from entering Britain. First, Saudi Arabia said Khashoggi had left the building alive, then that he had been killed in a ""fist-fight"" inside the consulate. This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi and how Saudi critics keep going missing It finally said that Khashoggi had been murdered in a ""rogue operation"" that the leadership had not been aware of. An unnamed Saudi official told Reuters news agency on Sunday that Khashoggi had died in a chokehold after resisting attempts to return him to Saudi Arabia. His body was then rolled in a rug and given to a local ""co-operator"" to dispose of, the official said. How Saudis changed story on Khashoggi What is Turkey's game with Saudi Arabia?

Khashoggi murder suspects barred from UK,"The men suspected of murdering the Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi will not be allowed to enter the UK, Theresa May has said. So far eighteen men have been arrested by the Saudi authorities in connection with the killing in Istanbul. Mrs May told MPs if any of them had British visas, they would be revoked. The PM said the claim the journalist had died in a fight was not credible and there was an ""urgent need"" to establish what had happened. Two senior officials have been removed from their posts after the Saudi authorities admitted that Mr Khashoggi had died during an incident in its consulate in Istanbul.

This video can not be played The SNP's Ian Blackford on Saudi Arabia: ""Condemnation wonât do, it is action which is requiredâ Mrs May told MPs that the Home Secretary, Sajid Javid, was taking action against all suspects to prevent them entering the UK. This follows a similar move by the United States. The PM also confirmed that no UK minister or official was attending the so-called ""Davos in the desert"" conference currently taking place in Riyadh. The event was intended to showcase Saudi Arabia's attempts at domestic reform and attract foreign investment to the country, but has been boycotted by leading politicians and companies. Downing Street has declined to comment on the number of individuals to whom visa restrictions would apply, but said it was speaking to the US and other allies about its response. Later on Wednesday, the prime minister spoke to King Salman, the head of Saudi Arabia's ruling family, by telephone to reiterate the UK's ""grave concerns"" about the murder of Mr Khashoggi, Downing Street said. A spokeswoman said: ""The prime minister said the current explanation lacks credibility so there remains an urgent need to establish exactly what happened ""She strongly urged Saudi Arabia to cooperate with the Turkish investigation and to be transparent about the results."" Prince vows to punish Khashoggi 'culprits' Trump: Khashoggi murder 'worst cover-up' How Saudis changed story on Khashoggi Labour has called for much stronger action against the Saudi authorities, including a ban on all UK arms sales to the desert kingdom and an end to the UK's backing for the Saudi-led bombing campaign against Houthi insurgents in Yemen. A spokesman for its leader Jeremy Corbyn said Mr Khashoggi's killing was ""a shocking act by a dictatorial regime involved in multiple human rights abuses at home and abroad"". This video can not be played Foreign Office minister Alan Duncan's fears on Saudi direction The country's de facto ruler, Crown Prince Mohamed bin Salman, has vowed to punish all the ""culprits"" responsible as he spoke publicly about the case for the first time.

Winning ticket in $1.6bn US lotto draw,"There had been queues for lottery tickets across the US A lottery ticket holder in South Carolina has scooped the largest jackpot in US history. Mega Millions confirmed there was one winner for the whopping $1.6bn (Â£1.2bn) prize,external. The jackpot numbers were: 28, 70, 5, 62, 65, with a Mega Ball of 5. The odds of choosing those numbers were said to be one in more than 300 million. People had been lining up at service stations and stores nationwide for a chance to win the huge prize. Tickets for the Mega Millions draw are sold in 44 US states, the District of Columbia and the US Virgin Islands and there had not been a top prize winner since July. ""The moment we've been waiting for finally arrived, and we couldn't be more excited,"" said Gordon Medenica, lead director of Mega Millions Group. ""This is truly a historic occasion. We're so happy for the winner, and we know the South Carolina Education Lottery can't wait to meet the lucky ticket holder."" But who that lucky winner is may remain a mystery to the public. South Carolina is one of eight states where lottery winners can keep their anonymity. US jackpot claimed amid anonymity battle The winner can decide to take a cash payout of $913m after tax, or opt to have it paid out in instalments over 29 years. Financial advisers have debated which option is better, and factors to consider include where a person lives, how much money they need each year, investment return rates and changes in federal taxes. Those who think the US top tax rate will drop over time should choose instalments. Those who do not trust themselves to avoid frivolous spending should also go for instalments, experts say. But, if a winner has the ability to invest the lump sum properly, that would create a heftier nest egg. This video can not be played Americans are rushing to buy lottery tickets for the chance to win $1.6bn The huge jackpot had lottery ticket buyers speculating on what they would do with the money if they won. Some dreamt of buying an island or a fast car, others of opening shops and creating jobs. The lottery firm said Tuesday's draw saw 36 people win second prize, and 419 win the $10,000 third prize. Mega Millions was created in 2002 and has seen a number of changes to the rules over the years that have reduced the odds of winning, leading to larger jackpots. What's the probability of winningMega Millions? Anthony Masters, a Statistical Ambassador from the Royal Statistical Society, says the probability of winning a Mega Millions jackpot is one in 300 million. It's more likelyâ¦ To flip a fair coin 28 times and get heads every time (one in 268 million) For two people to randomly dial the same eight digit phone number (one in 100 million). And it's far more likelyâ¦ To roll a six on a fair die 10 times in a row (one in 60 million) To die in a lightning strike (one in 114,000) Of course, winning the lottery with a single ticket is very unlikely indeed, but of course the likelihood of someone winning the jackpot is high. $1.58bn:A Powerball win in 2016.

Muslim 'crackdown' explained,"A Muslim man leads the call to prayer in China's Xinjiang region in 2008 China is facing growing criticism over its persecution of some Muslim minority groups, huge numbers of whom are allegedly being held in internment camps. In August 2018, a UN committee heard that up to one million Uighur Muslims and other Muslim groups could be being detained in the western Xinjiang region, where they're said to be undergoing ""re-education"" programmes. The claims were made by rights groups, but China denies the allegations. At the same time, there's growing evidence of oppressive surveillance against people living in Xinjiang.

China defends 'education centres',"Uighurs make up about 45% of the population in Xinjiang The top official in China's Xinjiang region has given the most detailed description yet of the alleged use of internment camps for Uighur Muslims. In an interview with state media, Shohrat Zakir said the ""vocational education"" centres were proving effective in staving off terrorism. He said ""trainees"" were grateful for the opportunity to change their ways and make their lives more ""colourful"". China's massive security crackdown in Xinjiang has sparked widespread alarm. Rights groups say Muslims are being detained indefinitely without charge for infractions like refusing to give a DNA sample, speaking in a minority language or arguing with officials. Officials have denied allegations that up to a million Muslim Uighurs and other minority groups are being detained, but insist that action is necessary to prevent terrorism. China's Muslim 'crackdown' explained China legalises Uighur 're-education' As chairman of the government in the autonomous western region, Shohrat Zakir is the most senior Xinjiang regional official to comment on the crackdown. His extensive interview,external, published in the state-controlled Xinhua news agency, appears to be a further attempt by China to counter rising criticism of its operations in Xinjiang by depicting it as benevolence. Mr Zakir said the region had been facing the ""three evil forces"" of terrorism, extremism and separatism since the 1990s, so the government had taken action to tackle the ""root causes"". The ""vocational education and training programme"" - now written into Chinese law- enables ""trainees"" to ""reflect on their mistakes and see clearly the essence and harm of terrorism and religious extremism"", he said. In the most detailed description yet of what goes on inside the centres, he said classes were given on Chinese history, language and culture and attendees were given ""an awareness of the nation, citizenship and rule of law"". He did not say whether those attending were forced to do so, but indicated they were staying on site, saying that cafeterias provided ""nutritious, free diets"", dormitories were ""fully equipped"" and there were regular contests and sporting events. But the China director for Human Rights Watch, Sophie Richardson, said Mr Zakir's interview failed to address concerns over ""mass arbitrary detention, pervasive restrictions on religious freedom, and repression"". She said the Chinese government would ""only gain credibility by releasing all the detainees and closing all camps, not by doubling down on propaganda campaigns"". Scattered throughout the interview are quotes, purportedly from ""graduates"", praising the government for giving them the opportunity to change their ways. China bans beards and veils in Xinjiang Profile: What is Xinjiang like? ""The government didn't give up on me. It has actively saved and assisted me, giving me free food, accommodation and education,"" said one. ""I will cherish this opportunity and become a person useful to the country and society."" Another said his income had ""increased a lot"" since receiving training. ""I have become the main support for my family. I can stand tall and start receiving praise from my elders. My wife has become more considerate. My kids are proud of me. I have regained respect and confidence."" Mr Zakir did not say how many people had been through the training, but said those who complete it have ""notably enhanced national consciousness"" and that Xinjiang was now ""not only beautiful but also safe and stable"". ""Many trainees have said that they were previously affected by extremist thought and had never participated in such kinds of art and sports activities, and now they have realised that life can be so colourful,"" he said. The Uighurs are ethnically Turkic Muslims mostly based in Xinjiang. They make up about 45% of the population there. They see themselves as culturally and ethnically close to Central Asian nations, and their language is similar to Turkish. In recent decades, large numbers of Han Chinese (China's ethnic majority) have migrated to Xinjiang, and the Uighurs feel their culture and livelihoods are under threat. Xinjiang is officially designated as an autonomous region within China, like Tibet to its south. Xinjiang has seen cycles of violence and crackdowns for years, but rights groups say the current operation goes far beyond tackling terrorism and could ultimately worsen the security situation. This video can not be played John Sudworth reports from Xinjiang, where all filming and reporting by foreign media is tightly controlled The World Uyghur Congress has said people are being held in detention indefinitely without charge. Some former detainees have told the BBC of physical as well as psychological torture. They allege that entire families have disappeared. Human Rights Watch has accused China of ""rampant abuses"" which violate the rights to freedom of expression, religion and privacy. The US has said it would consider sanctioning China over its policies.

Chinese social media censors John Oliver,"John Oliver is the latest target to be hit by Chinese censors If you're looking to post something about John Oliver on Chinese social media this week, chances are you can't. The British television host been censored on China's biggest social media site, just days after he criticised Chinese President Xi Jinping on his popular US show Last Week Tonight. In the show's latest episode, Mr Oliver highlights the political, human rights and economic issues China is currently facing, and delivers some striking criticisms of the Chinese government. Why China is censoring Winnie the Pooh again How authorities censor your thoughts Liu Xiaobo: The man China couldn't erase Attempts by the BBC to post a status on Weibo - China's biggest social media platform - with the term ""John Oliver"" were blocked. A pop-up message comes up when you try to key in the phrase ""John Oliver"" Instead an error message pops up, informing you that the post violates ""relevant laws and regulations"". If you try searching for ""John Oliver"", it does yield some results, though you won't find any new posts - the most recent one is from the 12 June, a week before the ""Last Week Tonight"" episode aired. A search for the show's name in Mandarin also brings up no results. In the 20-minute episode, the host touches on some topics that are known to be controversial in China. He mentions China's removal of presidential term limits, which has essentially allowed President Xi to remain in power for life, adding that Mr Xi has ""gone out of his way to form a cult of personality"". The removal of presidential terms was highly criticised and online censors had then rushed to block discussion around the topic. Mr Oliver also brings up China's treatment of the Uighurs, a Muslim minority who live primarily in the region of Xinjiang and say they have long faced discrimination. The Chinese government blames bloody clashes on Islamist militants and separatists. In recent yearsChina has introduced new restrictions on the Uighur people. The TV host also mentions Liu Xiaobo, one of China's most prominent human rights advocates and a Nobel peace prize laureate. Mr Liu, who died in 2017 at the age of 61, had been serving an 11-year prison term for subversion and was branded a criminal by authorities. Liu was seen as a hero by many but a villain by his own government Social media posts about Mr Liu have similarly been censored on Weibo, with Mr Oliver saying himself that: ""Chinese media won't allow mentions of [his] name."" His wife, Liu Xia, is still held under house arrest by Chinese authorities, and is said to be suffering from depression after spending years under heavy surveillance. ""Xi's crackdown on human rights is apparently the harshest crackdown since Tiananmen square,"" said Mr Oliver in his video. ""[He] has clamped down noticeably on any form of dissident whatsoever."" It is not uncommon for whole phrases or terms to be censored on Chinese social media. As Mr Oliver points out in his video, the Chinese name for Winnie the Pooh and pictures of the cuddly character were blocked on Weibo after bloggers continually compared him to China's president. China employs millions of people to monitor and censor internet activityand posts deemed to be politically incorrect are routinely deleted. Last Week Tonight is not officially available on Chinese television and YouTube remains blocked in China but clips of the show are available on Chinese video hosting platforms.

The FBI in New York said they were aware of the suspected packages,external, and that their Joint Terrorism Task force is aiding in the investigation. New York Mayor Bill de Blasio decried the attempted attacks as ""an act of terror attempting to undermine our free press and leaders of this country"". ""To all public officials, to all partisan affiliations - don't encourage violence, don't encourage hatred, don't encourage attacks on media you can disagree but you have to show respect."" The packages were addressed to former President Obama, ex-Secretary Clinton and former CIA Director John Brennan.

New York Governor Andrew Cuomo had said a suspicious package had been sent to his office, but New York police told the BBC ""it was a thumb drive and is not related to other events"". The devices are suspected to be pipe bombs. Law enforcement officials tell US media that the device discovered at CNN on Wednesday appears to be similar to the one found at Mr Soros' home on Monday. Police commissioner Mr O'Neill also said law enforcement found an ""envelope containing white powder"" in the packaging of the device sent to CNN. The powder is being investigated, but authorities found ""no additional threats"" after sweeping the area.

Young couples 'trapped in car dependency',"The scramble to build new homes is producing communities where cars are the only form of transport It must be miserable: youâve saved for a newly-built home past the townâs ring-road, but now you're trapped too often in a metal box with wheels. You spend hours in traffic ferrying yourself and your children around because your estate has no shops; no pub; no doctor; no school; no jobs. A report says this is the buttock-numbing fate of numerous young couples. It's come about because planners allowed edge-of-town housing estates where car travel is the only option. Intriguingly, the research by a new green group â Transport for New Homes - has been backed by a motoring group, the RAC Foundation. Researchers visited more than 20 new housing developments across England in what they say is the first piece of research of its kind. They found that the scramble to build new homes is producing houses next to bypasses and link roads which are too far out of town to walk or cycle, and which lack good local buses. In a jam Jenny Raggett, researcher at Transport for New Homes, said: ""We were appalled to find so many new housing developments built around the car with residents driving for almost every journey. âAs those cars head for our towns and cities they clog up existing roads. Commuter times get longer and longer. Car-based living of this kind is not good for our health or quality of life.â The report praises Poundbury in Dorset, which is designed around people, not cars Steve Gooding, director of the motoristsâ RAC Foundation, supported the research. He told BBC News: ""We need new housing developments with a genuine mix of transport options, which may include the private car but not exclude other ways of getting around. âItâs not much fun in one of these new estates where thereâs nowhere to park out front, so there are cars all over the pavements. You have to ferry your kids everywhere, and then you drive straight into a traffic jam. âThe government has got to think about this properly â we donât just need new homes anywhere we can put them â we need quality homes. Places like Poundbury (the Prince of Walesâ development) show it is possible to get this balance right."" What housing doesnât work? The report says: At Great Western Park near Didcot in Oxfordshire, residents climb over a fence to get where they need to go because footpaths with neighbouring areas are so poor. At Castle Mead near Trowbridge in Wiltshire, people wanting the shops, community centre or pub have to use an underpass after dark â or brave the lorries on a by-pass without a footpath. At Priorâs Hall Park near Corby in Northamptonshire, developers trumpeted the estateâs closeness to the M1 for the commute to London - but seven years since the first section was completed, thereâs no shop or cafÃ© on site. The area is criss-crossed by fast roads which make it hard to walk. David Cameron visited Great Western Park, which has faced problems with pedestrian access What housing does work? The report praises Poundbury in Dorset â tacked on to the outskirts of Dorchester and built on land owned by the Duchy of Cornwall. Itâs built to a traditional high-density urban pattern and has shops, businesses, and 35% affordable housing. It was designed around people rather than the car. The researchers said: âRather than a supermarket off a roundabout, a business park on a link road, and a pub by a distributor road junction, here was everything arranged as a truly walkable neighbourhood - and it worked. âThe secret is the layout of connected streets with interesting squares and courtyards, coupled with the way that offices, small shops, cafÃ©s, pubs and even a garden centre were integrated with the homes as in an authentic small town.â Ms Raggett told BBC News planners needed to change priorities to reproduce the success of Poundbury. Poundbury has shops, businesses and 35% affordable housing âThe problem is that planners are measured by whether they hit their targets for new housing,â she said. âAt the moment they just approach developers who are sitting on greenfield sites and end up peppering housing round towns without any regard to whether the land is accessible or not.â Councillor Martin Tett, transport spokesman for the Local Government Association, called for councils to be given powers to ensure house builders contribute to local infrastructure and services as part of new development. He said: âThe planning system exists to ensure development is appropriate and residents are able to have their say. âCouncils are determined to do more in planning for new places in ways that improve air quality and promote more sustainable forms of travel but a lack of funding is a clear barrier to such investment.â A government spokesperson said itsrevised planning rulebook,externaltells developers to create high quality areas which promote walking, cycling and use of public transport. They added: ""The rules also make sure that councils put plans in place for the infrastructure needed to support new developments.""

Apple boss - 'personal data is weaponised',"This video can not be played Tim Cook: personal data being 'weaponised' Apple chief executive Tim Cook has demanded a tough new US data protection law, in an unusual speech in Europe. Referring to the misuse of ""deeply personal"" data, he said it was being ""weaponised against us with military efficiency"". ""We shouldn't sugar-coat the consequences,"" he added. ""This is surveillance."" The strongly-worded speech presented a striking defence of user privacy rights from a tech firm's chief executive. Mr Cook also praised the EU's new data protection regulation, the General Data Protection Regulation (GDPR). The new lawcame into force in May. Mr Cook's speech,externalwas made in Brussels, at the International Conference of Data Protection and Privacy Commissioners. Facebook's Zuckerberg fires back at Apple's Tim Cook Apple's Tim Cook keeps nephew off social media Tim Cook: Leadership tips from Apple's chief executive The Apple boss described in some detail what he called the ""data industrial complex"", noting that billions of dollars were traded on the basis of people's ""likes and dislikes"", ""wishes and fears"" or ""hopes and dreams"" - the kind of data points tracked by tech firms and advertisers. He warned that the situation ""should make us very uncomfortable, it should unsettle us"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

And the trade in personal data served only to enrich the companies that collect it, he added. Mr Cook went on to commend the EU's GDPR, which places stricter rules on how personal data is handled by businesses and organisations. ""This year, you've shown the world that good policy and political will can come together to protect the rights of everyone,"" he said. ""It is time for the rest of the world, including my home country, to follow your lead. ""We at Apple are in full support of a comprehensive federal privacy law in the United States."" The remark was met with applause from the conference audience. ""I think it is striking that he's saying this,"" said Jim Killock, director of the Open Rights Group. ""It's the kind of thing you normally hear from civil society organisations."" Mr Killock told the BBC that he thought the call for a US privacy law was ""extremely important"". This video can not be played WATCH: What is GDPR? He also suggested that Mr Cook may have been motivated by commercial interests. ""US companies are losing trust and without that trust they cannot make the digital economy function as well as it should,"" said Mr Killock, referring to the negative public reaction surrounding data breaches and cases of data misuse. However, Prof Mark Elliot at Manchester University argued Mr Cook did not go far enough. ""The implication of fully functioning privacy in a digital democracy is that individuals would control and manage their own data and organisations would have to request access to that data rather than the other way round,"" he said. Apple has long been committed to privacy protection. The firm was famously locked in a dispute with the FBI over the fact that itwould not help the bureau access dataon the phone of a dead gunman who was involved in the San Bernardino shooting in 2015.

Single-use plastics ban backed by Euro MPs,"Ocean plastic is often eaten by sea animals, with fatal results The European Parliament has voted for a complete ban on a range of single-use plastics across the union in a bid to stop pollution of the oceans. MEPs backed a ban on plastic cutlery and plates, cotton buds, straws, drink-stirrers and balloon sticks. The proposal also calls for a reduction in single-use plastic for food and drink containers like plastic cups. One MEP said, if no action was taken, ""by 2050 there will be more plastic than fish in the oceans"". The European Commission proposed a ban in May, following a surge in public support attributed to documentaries such as David Attenborough's BBC Blue Planet series. The measure still has to clear some procedural hurdles, but is expected to go through. The EU hopes it will go into effect across the bloc by 2021. The UK will also have to incorporate the rules into national law if the ban becomes a fully-fledged directive before the end of a Brexit transition period. Allow YouTube content?

After the Parliament vote was backed by 571-53, the MEP responsible for the bill, FrÃ©dÃ©rique Ries, said it was ""a victory for our oceans, for the environment and for future generations."" Several countries are already considering proposals to target disposable plastic products - including the UK. Dead whale had eaten 80 plastic bags Companies pledge to cut plastic pollution 'Decades' of deep-sea plastic pollution The directive targets some of the most common ocean-polluting plastics. The list of banned items such as cutlery and cotton buds was chosen,externalbecause there are readily available alternatives, such as paper straws and cardboard containers. Other items, ""where no alternative exists"" will still have to be reduced by 25% in each country by 2025. Examples given include burger boxes and sandwich wrappers. MEPs also tacked on amendments to the plans for cigarette filters, a plastic pollutant that is common litter on beaches. Cigarette makers will have to reduce the plastic by 50% by 2025 and 80% by 2030. Another ambitious target is to ensure 90% of all plastic drinks bottles are collected for recycling by 2025. Currently, bottles and their lids account for about 20% of all the sea plastic, the European Parliament report said. Manufacturers will also have to take more responsibility for what happens to their plastic products and packaging. The EU's research on the topic says about 150,000 tonnes of plastic are tossed into European waters every year. That is only a small contributor to the global problem, with an estimated eight million tonnes of plastic entering the world's oceans annually. And once there, plastic can travel great distances on ocean currents. Those plastics have a huge effect on marine life. Fish and large aquatic mammals can be killed by the pollution.Whales can eat plastic bags, making it impossible for them to eat real foodwhich can eventually lead to death. When plastic debris breaks down from wear and tear, it does not decompose the way other products like wood do - but instead breaks down into smaller and smaller pieces, becoming ""microplastic"". These tiny fragments often end up in fishand can then be passed on to humans. Large volumes of plastic waste wash up on beaches, where they can be eaten by sea birds and other animals and kill them.

Two convicted of running illegal school,"Nacerdine Talbi (left) and Beatrix Bernhardt (right) were accused of running an unregistered school The first-ever convictions for operating an unregistered school in England have been imposed at Westminster Magistrates' Court. Nacerdine Talbi and Beatrix Bernhardt faced charges over the Al-Istiqamah Learning Centre, which taught about 58 pupils in a west London office block. The defendants had argued that this was a study centre where home-educated children had part-time tuition. But the court ruled that they were in effect running a full-time school. The chief magistrate of England and Wales, Emma Arbuthnot, in the first verdict of its kind, said the evidence showed the centre was ""being operated as an unregistered independent educational institution providing full-time education"". The defendants have been given a community order of a 12-week night time curfew and the court heard that the school would be likely to be closed temporarily. The institution itself, of which Mr Talbi was the director, was fined Â£100. This landmark case followed warnings over several years from the education watchdog Ofsted that there could be hundreds of such unregulated institutions. There had been calls for action against such schools, with inspectors saying that they were avoiding scrutiny over the quality of lessons and teachers and the safety of pupils. Is there a problem with unregistered schools? Ofsted warns of 'squalid' illegal schools The Al-Istiqamah Learning Centre had claimed that it was not a formal, full-time school. It argued that pupils did not have more than 18 hours per week of lessons that, according to guidelines, could have made it liable to register as an independent school. Ofsted inspectors had tried to visit on several occasions - and the court heard evidence that at least 27 pupils were at the school for 25 hours per week and others more than 18 hours. The Learning Centre, in an office block in west London, was accused of operating as a full-time school There were other indications of this being a full-time school in all but name - with a head teacher, homework and fees charged in a way that suggested academic terms. There were lessons in subjects including maths, science, geography, history, English and Arabic, with fees of Â£250 per month for secondary age pupils. The hours were such that pupils could not have attended school elsewhere, said inspectors. The chief magistrate concluded that the centre was ""providing all, or substantially all,"" of the education for those attending for 25 hours. As such the centre was ""being operated as an unregistered independent educational institution providing full-time education"". Ofsted chief Amanda Spielman said: ""We hope that today's judgment sends out a message to all those running such schools that they will face justice. ""We will continue to investigate and expose illegal, unregistered schools and where we find them, play our part in making sure they are closed or become properly registered."" Education Minister Lord Agnew welcomed the court's ruling. ""We have always been clear that where schools are operating illegally, action will be taken and this decision is evidence of that."" Lord Agnew said it would help to ""keep children safe and ensure they are getting the best possible education"". Should a school be in a place like this?

Heywood stands down as civil service chief,"Sir Jeremy, pictured here on the left of PM Theresa May in 2016 Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have led tributes to the UK's top civil servant who is stepping down due to ill health. Sir Jeremy, cabinet secretary since 2012 and head of the civil service since 2014, was already on a leave of absence while being treated for cancer. Mrs May said he had ""made a contribution to public life few in our country can match"". Mr Corbyn said he was an ""impressive, well-informed and dedicated public servant"". Sir Jeremy is being succeeded by Sir Mark Sedwill, who had been standing in for him since June. The cabinet secretary is the prime minister's principal adviser, and as head of the civil service is in charge of 500,000 public servants across the country. In a statement announcing his decision to step down, Sir Jeremy said the job had been ""the greatest privilege of my career"". By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent You may not have heard of Sir Jeremy Heywood, but over the past two decades he has had a huge influence over how you have been governed. As one of the most powerful public servants in the land, he served four prime ministers - managing Tony Blair's differences with his chancellor, organising Gordon Brown's occasionally chaotic Downing Street, holding the Tory-Lib Dem coalition together, and finally supporting Theresa May's minority administration. To his many admirers, Sir Jeremy was the chief engineer of the ship of state, the Whitehall fixer with a huge brain who sorted problems and made things happen. To his critics, he was Sir Cover Up, an establishment figure who resisted official transparency. Either way, Sir Jeremy's departure leaves a huge hole at the heart of the British state. It is a hole that his successor must now fill as the civil service faces the enormous challenge of governance that is Brexit. Mrs May said: ""Jeremy has given exemplary service to the public in his civil service career. He has worked constantly to improve our country's future and to deliver for the public, serving prime ministers and ministers of all parties with distinction in the finest traditions of the civil service. ""I am personally grateful to him for the support he has given me as prime minister. He has made an enormous contribution to public life in our country and will be sorely missed.""

Sir Jeremy Heywood to take break for cancer treatment Top civil servant Sir Jeremy Heywood treated for cancer Profile: Jeremy Heywood - the next Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy, who joined the civil service as an economist in the Health and Safety Executive 35 years ago, said he still had the ""desire to serve my country and to make a positive difference"". ""It is with great sadness therefore that, on medical advice, I must now retire,"" he said. ""Since joining the civil service, I have had the privilege of supporting, at close quarters, four prime ministers, two Conservative and two Labour, and the first coalition government for decades, with its first full-time deputy prime minister. ""Throughout my career, I have seen it as my responsibility to look for fresh angles, to challenge lazy thinking and to work with colleagues to find solutions rather than simply identifying problems and obstacles that everyone can admire."" Sir Jeremy Heywood, pictured left of then PM David Cameron, in 2015 Sir Mark Sedwill, left, is the new cabinet secretary Notable issues Sir Jeremy worked on were the response to the 1990s exchange rate mechanism crisis and the 2008-09 credit crunch and financial crisis. On Brexit, he said he was ""particularly proud of the work Whitehall has done in seeking to bring clarity, shape and practical options to the table for ministers to discuss"". He praised the state of the civil service now, adding: ""Despite a number of recent 'noises off' from anonymous commentators, I believe that the service is in robust health, well-equipped to provide the support the country needs over the coming months and years.""

Men jailed over Gleneagles jewellery raid,"This video can not be played Gleneagles jewel heist caught on CCTV Two men who carried out a Â£500,000 armed jewellery robbery at the Gleneagles Hotel have been jailed. Richard Fleming and Liam Richardson were part of a three-man gang that stole 50 Rolex watches from the Mappin & Webb boutique at the luxury hotel. Fleming, 42, was jailed for 18 years and Richardson, 30, was jailed for 11 years and four months. A judge said the robbery was ""an act of serious premeditated criminality"". A trial heard that staff thought the gang were carrying out a ""terrorist attack"". Judge Lady Carmichael described Fleming as a danger to the public and placed him on extended licence for three years. Richard Fleming (L) and Liam Richardson stole more than Â£500,000 worth of Rolex watches from the hotel Lady Carmichael said the robbery involved ""significant advance planning"". She said: ""Criminal behaviour of this nature will not be tolerated and requires the imposition of a substantial period of imprisonment."" A trial at the High Court in Edinburgh was told that the trio was dressed in black. Fleming personally threatened employees Louis Hutchison, 48, and Euan Wishart, 36, with a gun, a machete and hammers. After a raid that lasted approximately two minutes, Fleming and his accomplices escaped from the scene in a high-powered Audi sports car, which they dumped nearby. They had taken 50 out of 51 Rolex watches that were on display at the boutique. The watches had a total value of Â£516,750 and have never been recovered. The robbery was carried out at the Gleneagles resort in Perthshire The robbers then drove to Glasgow in a Range Rover Evoque, which had been stolen earlier from London. It was later found burned out in a cemetery in the city's east end. After finding the car, detectives analysed ""tens of thousands of hours"" worth of CCTV recordings and studied mobile phone records, which placed Fleming and Richardson at the crime scene. Fleming maintained he was innocent of any wrong doing and had claimed that at the time of the robbery he was buying drugs in Parkhead, Glasgow. Richardson, of London, pleaded guilty to armed robbery at the start of his accomplice's trial in August.

Trump: Khashoggi murder 'worst cover-up'The US said it would revoke the visas of Saudi operatives suspected of killing the journalist.,"This video can not be played The US President criticises Saudi Arabia's handling of Jamal Khashoggi's death US President Donald Trump has said Saudi Arabia's response to the murder of the dissident journalist Jamal Khashoggi is ""the worst cover-up ever"". Those behind the killing in the Saudi consulate in Istanbul three weeks ago ""should be in big trouble"", he said. Shortly afterwards, Secretary of State Mike Pompeo said the US would ""punish those responsible"" and had revoked visas of 21 identified suspects. The Saudi government has blamed the murder on rogue agents. But President Erdogan of Turkey has said the journalist was the victim of a carefully planned ""political murder"" by Saudi intelligence officers and other officials. Speaking to reporters at the White House on Tuesday, Mr Trump said: ""They had a very bad original concept, it was carried out poorly and the cover-up was the worst in the history of cover-ups. ""Whoever thought of that idea, I think is in big trouble. And they should be in big trouble."" The Saudi government has provided conflicting accounts of what happened to Khashoggi, a US resident and Washington Post contributor. After weeks of maintaining he was still alive, senior officials now say the 59-year-old was murdered in a rogue operation after visiting the Saudi consulate in Turkey. The journalist who vanished into a consulate Why Saudi Arabia matters to the West What is Turkey's game with Saudi Arabia? What business does the UK do with Saudi Arabia? European Council President Donald Tusk said EU member states must pursue the full details of the killing and avoid any ""trace of hypocrisy"". In a speech to the European Parliament, Mr Tusk said he expected member states and institutions to avoid any ""ambiguous game"". Mr Trump's public criticism of Saudi Arabia on Tuesday was his strongest so far, but he has continued to highlight the kingdom's importance as a US ally. In a separate interview with the Wall Street Journal,Mr Trump addressed the possible involvement of Saudi royals in the killing,externaland said he did not believe King Salman had prior knowledge of the operation. When asked about the possible role of Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, the president replied: ""He's running things and so if anybody were going to be [informed], it would be him."" This video can not be played Jamal Khashoggi and how Saudi critics keep going missing He said he had questioned the crown prince about Khashoggi's death, and been told he did not know about the operation when it was being planned. Asked if he believed the royal family's denial, Mr Trump reportedly gave a long pause before saying: ""I really want to believe them."" All you need to know about Khashoggi's death Who's who in the 'hit squad'? Who was the victim? Mr Trump also said US intelligence officials were returning from Turkey and Saudi Arabia with information about the case. CIA director Gina Haspel has been sent to Turkey.Intelligence officials have shared an audio recording from inside the Saudi consulate,externalwith her, the Daily Sabah newspaper says. The reported recording is said to reveal gruesome details of the murder. The US president appears to have changed his mind on the issue. When asked by a reporter in Arizona a few days ago whether he thought Saudi Arabia's explanation for Khashoggi's death was credible, he said: ""I do."" Mr Pompeo said the US was looking into the possibility of imposing sanctions on those believed to be involved in Khashoggi's killing beyond revoking their visas. ""These penalties will not be the last word on this matter from the United States,"" he added. Mr Pompeo told reporters he was working on other measures against the suspected killers Mr Pompeo said the suspects worked in the Saudi intelligence services, the foreign ministry and the royal court. But a state department official said they would not be named due to ""visa confidentiality"". On Tuesday,Turkey's president told MPs from his ruling party that the killing of Khashoggi was planned days in advance. Mr Erdogan said Turkey had strong evidence the journalist was killed in a premeditated and ""savage"" murder at the Saudi consulate in Istanbul on 2 October. He also called for the suspects to be tried in Istanbul. This video can not be played Recep Tayyip Erdogan says many questions need to be answered Mr Erdogan's address coincided with the start of an investment conference in Saudi Arabia that has been overshadowed by the Khashoggi case. Dozens of government and business leaders have pulled out, but Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman appeared at the event on Tuesday. Saudi summit begins despite calls for a boycott How Saudis changed story on Khashoggi Many world leaders have condemned the murder of the prominent Saudi critic and demanded a full investigation. This video can not be played Why do Trump's Saudi job numbers keep growing? King Salman chaired a cabinet meeting on Tuesday, after which a statement said Saudi Arabia would hold to account those responsible for the killing. State media also said the king and the crown prince had held a meeting in Riyadh with members of the Khashoggi family, including Khashoggi's son, Salah. The Associated Press reported that Salah had been under a travel ban since last year because of his father's work. The Saudi crown prince met Khashoggi's son, Salah, in Riyadh on Tuesday Saudi Arabia's account of Khashoggi's fate has not been consistent. First it said Khashoggi had left the building alive, then that he had been killed in a ""fist-fight"" inside the consulate, before finally saying that Khashoggi had been murdered in a ""rogue operation"" that the leadership had not been aware of. ""The individuals who did this did this outside the scope of their authority,"" Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir told Fox News. ""There obviously was a tremendous mistake made, and what compounded the mistake was the attempt to try to cover up."" He said that Saudi Arabia did not know where the body was. Is this the end of Saudi prince's honeymoon? An unnamed Saudi official told Reuters news agency on Sunday that Khashoggi had died in a chokehold after resisting attempts to return him to Saudi Arabia. His body was then rolled in a rug and given to a local ""co-operator"" to dispose of. In addition to the arrests of 18 people, the Saudis say they have sacked two of the crown prince's aides and set up an organisation, under his leadership, to reform the intelligence agency. Saudi summit website attacked by hackers According to Reuters news agency, quoting Turkish and Arabic intelligence sources, one of the sacked aides appeared via Skype during Khashoggi's questioning. Saud al-Qahtani was quoted as giving the instructions ""bring me the head of the dog"", after the two men traded insults. The sources say President Erdogan has a copy of the Skype audio but is refusing to hand it over to the US. What is Turkey's game with Saudi Arabia?

"Heywood stands down as civil service chiefThe cabinet secretary, Sir Jeremy Heywood, is leaving his post because of illness.UK Politics","Sir Jeremy, pictured here on the left of PM Theresa May in 2016 Theresa May and Jeremy Corbyn have led tributes to the UK's top civil servant who is stepping down due to ill health. Sir Jeremy, cabinet secretary since 2012 and head of the civil service since 2014, was already on a leave of absence while being treated for cancer. Mrs May said he had ""made a contribution to public life few in our country can match"". Mr Corbyn said he was an ""impressive, well-informed and dedicated public servant"". Sir Jeremy is being succeeded by Sir Mark Sedwill, who had been standing in for him since June. The cabinet secretary is the prime minister's principal adviser, and as head of the civil service is in charge of 500,000 public servants across the country. In a statement announcing his decision to step down, Sir Jeremy said the job had been ""the greatest privilege of my career"". By James Landale, BBC diplomatic correspondent You may not have heard of Sir Jeremy Heywood, but over the past two decades he has had a huge influence over how you have been governed. As one of the most powerful public servants in the land, he served four prime ministers - managing Tony Blair's differences with his chancellor, organising Gordon Brown's occasionally chaotic Downing Street, holding the Tory-Lib Dem coalition together, and finally supporting Theresa May's minority administration. To his many admirers, Sir Jeremy was the chief engineer of the ship of state, the Whitehall fixer with a huge brain who sorted problems and made things happen. To his critics, he was Sir Cover Up, an establishment figure who resisted official transparency. Either way, Sir Jeremy's departure leaves a huge hole at the heart of the British state. It is a hole that his successor must now fill as the civil service faces the enormous challenge of governance that is Brexit. Mrs May said: ""Jeremy has given exemplary service to the public in his civil service career. He has worked constantly to improve our country's future and to deliver for the public, serving prime ministers and ministers of all parties with distinction in the finest traditions of the civil service. ""I am personally grateful to him for the support he has given me as prime minister. He has made an enormous contribution to public life in our country and will be sorely missed.""

Sir Jeremy Heywood to take break for cancer treatment Top civil servant Sir Jeremy Heywood treated for cancer Profile: Jeremy Heywood - the next Cabinet Secretary Sir Jeremy, who joined the civil service as an economist in the Health and Safety Executive 35 years ago, said he still had the ""desire to serve my country and to make a positive difference"". ""It is with great sadness therefore that, on medical advice, I must now retire,"" he said. ""Since joining the civil service, I have had the privilege of supporting, at close quarters, four prime ministers, two Conservative and two Labour, and the first coalition government for decades, with its first full-time deputy prime minister. ""Throughout my career, I have seen it as my responsibility to look for fresh angles, to challenge lazy thinking and to work with colleagues to find solutions rather than simply identifying problems and obstacles that everyone can admire."" Sir Jeremy Heywood, pictured left of then PM David Cameron, in 2015 Sir Mark Sedwill, left, is the new cabinet secretary Notable issues Sir Jeremy worked on were the response to the 1990s exchange rate mechanism crisis and the 2008-09 credit crunch and financial crisis. On Brexit, he said he was ""particularly proud of the work Whitehall has done in seeking to bring clarity, shape and practical options to the table for ministers to discuss"". He praised the state of the civil service now, adding: ""Despite a number of recent 'noises off' from anonymous commentators, I believe that the service is in robust health, well-equipped to provide the support the country needs over the coming months and years.""

Police hunt Ross from Friends lookalike,"The one with the doppelganger: People thought the suspect (left) bore a striking resemblance to actor David Schwimmer A UK police force's image of a Ross Geller ""lookalike"" has drawn thousands of comedy responses. Officers shared the CCTV still of the man, dubbed the ""spitting image"" of Friends actor David Schwimmer, clutching a crate of beer. Within minutes, fans of the 90s sitcom had bombardedBlackpool Police's Facebook post with jokes inspired by the show,external. Police later said Schwimmer was not in the UK at the time of the offence. ""Thank you to everyone for your speedy responses. We have investigated this matter thoroughly and have confirmed that David Schwimmer was in America on this date,"" they wrote. ""We're so sorry it has to be this way."" People made plenty of Friends gags on the police's Facebook page As comments on the post descended into something of a Friends quote-fest, a number of the 50,000 users who chipped in referenced the show's chart-topping theme song. ""I don't think it's been this guy's day, his week, his month or even his year,"" wrote Nick Croston, while Olly Byrne quipped: ""I'm suprised you've not found him... it's like you're always stuck in second gear."" Others, such as Joe Richardson, riffed on some of Ross's most well-known quotes. ""Shouldn't he be at work...or is he on a break?"", asked Joe. While Jay Murdoch wrote: ""Apparently the police had him cornered then he performed a pivot manoeuvre and escaped."" Craig Thompson added: ""I saw him behind me in the shop around that time.. just as I was paying for MY SANDWICH."" Scottish police also got in on the act, with bobbies in Dumfries and Galloway sharing the post and warning members of the public to ""keep away"" from the suspect. ""He is known to have studied Karate and we believe he has mastered the art of Unagi, the state of total awareness,"" they wrote. Could he BE any more innocent? Police said the real Schwimmer was not in the UK at the time of the offence However, some commentators reminded their fellow Friends fans that a real-life crime had been committed. ""He's a thief and it's serious,"" wrote Grace Higham.  ""But these comments are hilarious."" 'Fred Flintstone' police e-fit mocked 'Cheshire Cat burglar' e-fit raises smiles E-fit of suspect likened to He-Man Police appealed for anyone with brand new information about the theft, which took place at Mr Basrai's restaurant on Talbot Road 20 September, to contact them. The jacket was taken from a restaurant in Blackpool's town centre The suspect is wanted for the alleged theft of a jacket, wallet and mobile from the restaurant. Police released the CCTV image of the suspect buying beer from a shop. Schwimmer starred in Friends from 1994 until its finale in 2004.

Nicki Minaj sued over Tracy Chapman song,"Nicki Minaj is being sued over the alleged use of Tracy Chapman's song Baby Can I Hold You Nicki Minaj is being sued by singer-songwriter Tracy Chapman over claims she sampled her song without permission. A lawsuit has been filed over Nicki's track Sorry - which it's claimed she wanted to release on her album Queen - in a court in Los Angeles. It's alleged the rapper used a sample from Tracy's 1988 hit Baby Can I Hold You - despite being told she couldn't. Newsbeat has contacted a representative for Nicki Minaj for a comment. Tracy Chapman has won four Grammys over a career spanning 20 years. Her last album Our Bright Future was released in 2008. The lawsuit claims Nicki, real name Onika Tanya Maraj, tried several times to get permission to use the sample after she'd already recorded her song using it. It says Tracy's representatives ""repeatedly"" denied the request. Allow YouTube content? This article contains content provided by Google YouTube.

It alleges the Super Bass singer went on to give the song to a DJ at a New York radio station - who teased it on his Twitter and Instagram accounts. The court documents also claim that Funkmaster Flex played it on his radio show. ""This action is necessary to redress Maraj's disregard and wilful infringement of Chapman's rights under the Copyright Act, and to ensure that her misconduct is not repeated,"" the lawsuit adds. The legal documents claim that in July, Nicki tweeted she had ""no clue"" she had sampled Tracy's song and asked whether she should keep to the release date for her album Queen or lose the song. In another tweet she also ""reached out"" to Tracy to ask for permission to use the sample for Sorry. Nicki Minaj: Is the queen of rap's crown fading? Nicki Minaj 'mortified' by Cardi B scuffle Nicki Minaj reveals details of new album The lawsuit says Queen was released in August without the song included but it was played by Funkmaster Flex, real name Aston George Taylor, on his radio show. The legal documents claim it was then reproduced on several different websites. ""Maraj wrongfully deprived Chapman of the right and opportunity to decide whether to allow the use of the composition, and, if so, on what terms,"" the lawsuit claims.

"UK 'will pay the price' of no-deal BrexitNew border controls may not be ready in the event of a no-deal Brexit, a government watchdog warns.","Queues of lorries left residents near the Port of Dover unable to get out to buy basic supplies in 2015 Britain will ""pay the price"" of a no-deal Brexit because complicated new border controls may not be ready in time, a government watchdog has warned. Thousands of UK exporters did not have enough time to prepare for new border rules, the National Audit Office said. Criminal gangs could exploit any border weaknesses and queues and delays were likely at border crossings, it added. The government said it was confident of striking a ""good"" deal with the EU for as ""frictionless"" trade as possible. It said that plans were already 95% complete. The National Audit Office acknowledged that government had made some progress on preparing for the possibility of a ""hard"" Brexit. It is the official body charged with scrutinising the operation of government departments and reporting to MPs so that they can hold the government to account. Its head, Sir Amyas Morse, said:  ""The government has openly accepted the border will be sub-optimal if there is no deal with the EU on 29 March 2019. ""It is not clear what sub-optimal means in practice, or how long this will last. ""But what is clear is that businesses and individuals who are reliant on the border running smoothly will pay the price."" Outside the EU there will need to be new border controls The NAO said that there was Â£423bn of trade which crosses UK borders every year, much of that with the EU or onto other destinations via the rest of Europe. Over 200 million people also cross the border. At present, Britain's membership of the EU single market and the customs union allows for the free movement of goods, people and services around Europe. There's more on those freedoms here. Outside the EU there will need to be new border controls and if there is no deal those controls will have to be stricter than if Britain agreed a ""soft"" Brexit which included a 19 month implementation period. The NAO said that under a ""no deal"" up to 250,000 firms may need to fill out customs declarations forms for the first time as Britain moved onto World Trade Organisation (WTO) rules. The WTO governs global trading relationships between countries. Her Majesty's Revenue and Customs (HMRC) - which collects taxes at the border - could also have to deal with as many as 260 million customs declarations a year, up from 55 million. The NAO said that new border checks could lead to delays at crossing points, increased risk of customs non-compliance and queues of lorries, for example, trying to cross onto the European continent at Dover and Folkestone in Kent. Traffic cross between Northern Ireland and the Irish Republic in County Donegal The report also said that there was no agreement yet in place to deal with the issue of the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic - the only land border Britain will have with the EU after Brexit. Of 12 ""critical"" projects preparing Britain's borders for a no deal, 11 were ""at risk of not being delivered on time and to acceptable quality"", the NAO said. ""Although the government has achieved much and its planning efforts have increased in momentum, given the scale of the task, there are inevitably gaps and risks to its progress that I am obliged to point out,"" Sir Amyas said. ""But I do so while recognising that these are not normal times for individual departments or the government as a whole."" The NAO said that properly policed borders were ""fundamentally important to national security, effective trade, tourism, well-managed migration, healthy communities and the environment"" and that there was a high level of risk that new border controls would not be ready on time. ""Organised criminals and others are likely to be quick to exploit any perceived weaknesses or gaps in the enforcement regime,"" the NAO said. ""This, combined with the UK's potential loss of access to EU security, law enforcement and criminal justice tools, could create security weaknesses which the government would need to address urgently."" The NAO said there was a risk that organised crime could exploit any weaknesses in the border to smuggle goods into the country or traffic people in. However, the NAO's report said it recognised that the government was aware of the changing risks at the border. The government said it had made significant progress planning for a ""no deal"". ""Extensive work to prepare for a no deal has been well underway for almost two years and we have robust plans in place to ensure the border continues to operate from the day we leave,"" a spokesman said. ""Future IT systems and infrastructure are already being built and, as they do today, HMRC will continue to apply an automated, risk-based approach to customs checks. ""This means any increase in the number of checks will be kept to a minimum. ""We will always ensure we have the necessary resources to keep the border secure, and that's why we're recruiting approximately 600 Border Force officers to prepare for the day we leave the EU, in addition to the 300 officers which will be deployed by the end of the year.""

Designer admits choke baby death failure,"Craig Williams had denied manslaughter and fraud in relation to Oscar Abbey's death A designer has admitted a health and safety failing after a seven-month-old baby ""choked to death"" in a cot bed. Oscar Abbey was found by his parents, caught in the side of his bed at their home in York on 3 November 2016. He had got his head stuck while trying to crawl through a gap in the cot sold by Craig Williams's Playtime Beds Ltd. Williams, 37, from Rotherham, South Yorkshire, pleaded guilty at Leeds Crown Court to failing to discharge the employer's general duty. Charlie and Shannon Abbey had paid Â£655 including delivery costs for the cot bed, which featured a slide, from the firm owned by Williams. Jurors heard the couple were told by the designer the bed was suitable for children aged six or seven months and their son first started using it on 28 October 2016. In a statement read during the trial, Mrs Abbey, 23, said: ""At no point was I advised that it was not suitable."" Oscar Abbey died of positional asphyxia after he got his head stuck, the court heard On the night of Oscar's death, prosecutor John Elvidge QC, had told the court: ""He wriggled his body through the holes at the front of his cot bed. ""His head was too big to fit through. ""In effect, he choked to death. He was starved of oxygen."" More news from Yorkshire Mr Abbey, 24, said in his statement he found his son trapped face-down in the front of the cot. ""It looked like he'd tried to crawl out backwards but his head was stuck,"" he said. Mrs Abbey also described how she woke up and heard her husband ""shouting and screaming: 'He's not breathing'. ""I ran to the landing and Charlie was holding Oscar in both arms,"" she said. Mr Elvidge told the court Playtime Beds Ltd had received a complaint in March 2016 from a customer saying the bed she bought did not meet standards. But Williams told the customer: ""I have been in touch with trading standards and they are happy with my products,"" the prosecutor said. Mr Elvidge said the trading standards office had no record of contact from the defendant. The court heard Williams continued to make beds and did not alter his designs even after Oscar's death. ""Maybe the only reasonable inference to be drawn is that he didn't care at all about the fate of those using his beds,"" said Mr Elvidge. Sheffield-based company Playtime Beds Ltd made bespoke MDF beds in various shapes. As Williams had admitted a charge under the Health and Safety at Work Act the jury was asked to return a not guilty verdict to gross negligence manslaughter. Williams, of Park View Road, Kimberworth, also pleaded guilty to fraud. He is due to be sentenced on Friday alongside employee Joseph Bruce, 30, of Kimberworth Park Road, Rotherham, who also admitted the same charge. Bruce had been purported to be running a new bed company set up following Oscar's death, but that was still Williams' firm.

Two unborn babies' spines repaired in womb,"Two unborn babies have had their spines repaired by surgeons - weeks before they were born. The operations - which are the first ever of their kind in the UK - were carried out by a team of 30 doctors at University College Hospital in London. The babies had spina bifida, a condition when the spinal cord fails to develop properly and has a gap in it. It is usually treated after birth, but the earlier it is repaired the better for long-term health and mobility. During the 90-minute surgery carried out this summer, doctors cut an opening in the womb and then stitched together the baby's gap in the spine. The procedure is risky and can cause premature labour, but researchers are exploring less invasive keyhole methods. ""We put the mum on some drugs that help relax them, but there is still a risk,"" said UCL Professor Anne David, who has worked on bringing the surgery to the UK for three years. Mums and babies are recovering well, the hospital said. Spina bifida: 'Giving babies a chance' Fundraising appeal after foetus surgery Mothers previously had to go abroad to the US, Belgium or Switzerland for the operation. ""It's fantastic,"" said Prof David. ""Women now don't have to travel out of the UK. They can have their family with them. There are less expenses. So all good things."" According to the charity Shine, more than 200 children are born with spina bifida every year. The NHS says,externalthe condition happens when the baby's neural tube - an early form of the baby's brain and spinal cord - does not form properly and leads to gaps or defects in the spinal cord and bones of the spine. Surgery can be used to close the gap in the spine in most cases, but often the nervous system will already have been damaged leading to problems including paralysis of the legs and incontinence. Some people with the condition have learning difficulties. It is not known what causes the condition, which develops during pregnancy, but a lack of folic acid can increase the risk. The surgery, which follows a trial in the US, will be available for patients through the new Centre for Prenatal Therapy at Great Ormond Street Hospital and UCL hospital. ""There were some children who had grown up following foetal surgery who were walking and you wouldn't expect them to be walking if they hadn't had it,"" said Prof David, of the recent US study.

Court stops paper's 'harassment' story,"A ""leading businessman"" has won a legal battle to stop a newspaper printing harassment claims against him. Three Court of Appeal judges granted an injunction to stop the Daily Telegraph publishing its article. The judges say the five staff making the claims had been ""compromised by settlement agreements"" and had received ""substantial"" payouts to stay silent. Theresa May would not comment directly on the case, but said some companies used such agreements ""unethically"". Mrs May said non-disclosure agreements, or NDAs, should not silence whistle blowers. She added the government would take action to make sure employees knew their rights. A Labour MP said NDAs were being used by the rich and powerful to do ""whatever they wanted"". The Telegraph's editorsaid the public ""have a right to know when the powerful seek to gag the vulnerable"",external. The '#MeToo claims which cannot be revealed' The paper said it spenteight months investigating allegations of bullying, intimidation and sexual harassment made against the businessman,external. It said publishing the allegations would ""be sure to reignite the #MeToo movement against the mistreatment of women, minorities and others by powerful employers"". But after the accused boss was contacted for comment by the paper in July, he and a number of his senior staff applied for an injunction to stop the details being published. In August, a High Court judge refused to grant the gagging order. Mr Justice Haddon-Cave said the information was ""clearly capable of significantly contributing to a debate in a democratic society"" and ""making a contribution to a current debate of general public interest on misconduct in the workplace"". But the executive and his managers appealed the decision, saying details of the allegations had been ""disclosed in breach of confidence"" as the five staff had signed NDAs. On Tuesday, the Appeal Court judges - Sir Terence Etherton, Lord Justice Underhill and Lord Justice Henderson - published a ruling in the businessman's favour. It mentioned allegations of ""discreditable conduct"", but said the paper was aware of NDAs signed by the accusers, in which they agreed to keep the details ""confidential"". It was therefore prevented from publishing them. This video can not be played Is it ok that ""people with money are effectively able to gag claims of wrong doing against them?"" asks Camilla Tominey on Radio 4's World at One The Telegraph said the ruling made it ""illegal to reveal the businessman's identity or to identify the companies, as well as what he is accused of doing or how much he paid his alleged victims"" pending a full hearing early next year. The paper said NDAs were used in business to protect commercial confidentiality but there are concerns they are being abused to conceal wrongdoing and deter victims of potential crimes from going to police. During prime minister's questions on Wednesday, Mrs May declined to comment directly on the court's decision. However, she said: ""Non-disclosure agreements cannot stop people from whistle blowing, but it is clear that some employers are using them unethically. She added that the government would consult on whether the regulation around non-disclosure agreements could be improved, so employers and employees were aware when a NDA did not apply or could not be enforced. Labour MP Jess Phillips told the Commons: ""It seems that our laws allow rich and powerful men to pretty much do whatever they want as long as they can pay to keep it quiet."" Theresa May spoke about NDAs at prime minister's questions By Clive Coleman, BBC legal correspondent The Harvey Weinstein scandal and the #MeToo movement put the spotlight on the use and abuse of non-disclosure agreements by powerful individuals. The concerns have reached parliament, with the Women and Equalities Committee saying they were ""used unfairly by someâ¦ to silence victims of sexual harassment"". But this case is different. The Court of Appeal made it clear that there was no evidence any of the NDAs resulted from bullying, harassment or undue pressure, and each employee received independent legal advice before entering into them. Also, two of the staff who made the accusations against the businessman supported the injunction. This may seem odd but it's not unusual, as some people, even victims, don't want a problem at work to follow them afterwards. NDAs are just contracts. If they are entered into freely, with proper legal advice, the courts are loathe to unpick them. The ones used by powerful rich people to gag alleged victims are an area of massive concern, but this does not appear to be a good example of that kind of abuse. It is likely we are going to see a lot more of these type of cases though, as the press will continue to drive on and fight where they believe there is a public interest in going behind an NDA.

The fault affected services on the South Western Main Line between Woking and Surbiton. Despite the line reopening at 11:30 GMT, South Western Railway (SWR) advised passengers to seek alternative travel arrangements to avoid delays.

Three trains an hour had passed through by 09:00 and from about 11:30, a full service has been possible. But with trains and crews all out of place, it will be some hours before SWR can resume anything approaching what it had anticipated being able to operate on a strike day.

Summer baby school delays Ã¢ÂÂa lotteryÃ¢ÂÂ,"Parents who want to delay their child's first year of school have varying success rates depending on where they live, a BBC investigation has found. Thousands of families in England with summer-born babies are applying each year amid fears younger children do not perform as well as older classmates. But while some councils have approved 100% of requests, others have turned down more than half. Campaigners said a consistent approach was needed across the country. Children have traditionally been placed in school years according to their date of birth with a cut-off at the start of September. This has meant some children born in the summer have been almost a year younger than their eldest classmates when they start in reception. But parents of children born between 1 April and 31 August are now able to apply to put reception back a year. Figures supplied under the Freedom of Information Act show 2,243 requests were made to 110 local authorities in England to defer starts to the 2018 school year - 18% higher than the previous 12 months. But the rate of requests and their success rates varied considerably across England. Over a three-year period, Medway turned down 13 out of 17 applications and Wokingham rejected 12 out of 20. Nottingham and Manchester also both rejected more than half of the requests made. A third of councils who responded did not refuse any requests. These included Northamptonshire, which received 142 applications since 2016 and did not turn down any of them. Nottinghamshire, Liverpool, Wandsworth, York, Merton, Isle of Wight, Cheshire East, Cumbria and Shropshire were also among those with a 0% rejection rate. Jennie Blake, from Manchester, applied to Manchester City Council to request a delay in her son Nikolai starting school in September 2017, as his birthday was in May and she thought he was too young to start school. But after being turned down by the authority, the 38-year-old said her son later needed extra help at school because of his age. ""It would be so different if my son was under Cheshire East 20 minutes down the road, or in Liverpool,"" Ms Blake said. She said the council, which has rejected more than half of the requests made over three years, was ""messing with children's lives"". Ms Blake said she was now preparing the case to have her second child, now aged two, defer a year as they were born on 20 August. Manchester council's schools chief Councillor Luthfur Rahman, said the authority made decisions ""on the merits of each individual case"". ""After carefully considering Ms Blake's request, with input from Nikolai's nursery being sought, we were confident that the school could meet Nikolai's needs while educating him within his peer group."" Department for Education analysis has previously suggested it is typically more affluent familiesfrom white British backgrounds who make the requests, and those in areas where the council are more likely to agree to them. In a survey in 2017 of 161 families who successfully applied to delay the start of their child's schooling, the DfE found 47% had a household income of more than Â£50,000 a year. 'Don't ignore the children', government urged Eleven-plus pupils wrongly told 'you're in' Autistic boy 'mocked' by railway staff Of the 110 councils that responded to the BBC with comparable data, Haringey in London had the most requests with almost 18 for every 1,000 pupils for 2018, while in Devon there were about 15 requests per 1,000 pupils. Other areas received few applications - Doncaster only saw two across three years, while Rochdale said it had not received any requests at the time of responding. While the School Admissions Code requires councils to provide schooling for all children in the September following their fourth birthday, a child does not reach compulsory school age until the term after their fifth birthday. Julie McCulloch, director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ""Some have a policy of automatically agreeing all requests, while others only agree requests where parents present very strong evidence. ""We think there should be a consistent approach across the country."" Dr Claire Crawford has researched summer-born children's attainment at school Dr Claire Crawford, from the University of Birmingham, has researched the attainment of summer-born children at school. She said: ""We found it [the attainment gap] was very large at the beginning of schooling as you might expect when the children are less mature, and the one year difference is a much bigger proportion of their lives."" She added: ""Some parents may be more able to apply to defer their child or have access to the research than others."" 'Don't ignore the children', government urged DFE caught adding tuition fees to school funding claims Clapping out, jazz hands in at university In 2015,schools minister Nick Gibb launched a reviewon allowing schools to admit summer-born children to reception class at the age of five, if their parents wanted this. TheSummer Born Campaign,externalhas called on the DfE to make it easier for summer-born children to start reception when at compulsory school age. Rosie Dutton, from The Summer Born Campaign, wants the government to legislate on the issue Spokeswoman Rosie Dutton said: ""It has been over three years since that letter was released by Nick Gibb, and in those three years many children have been forced to miss reception or start school before their parents wanted them to. ""We really need this legislation published quickly."" A DfE spokesman said: ""We have given councils clear advice on how to support parents who want to delay their child's admission to reception until compulsory school age so that families can make the right choice for their child."" He added research released in May suggested the majority of requests for delayed admissions were being agreed in line with parents' wishes.

Three trains an hour had passed through by 09:00 and from about 11:30, a full service has been possible. But with trains and crews all out of place, it will be some hours before SWR can resume anything approaching what it had anticipated being able to operate on a strike day. Frustrated passengers have been venting on social media about the delays. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Queen looks to 'new partnership' with Europe,"The UK is looking toward a ""new partnership"" with Europe after Brexit, the Queen has said. Speaking at a state banquet for the King of the Netherlands, the Queen said the ""enduring alliance"" between the two countries remained strong. ""As innovators, traders and internationalists we look with confidence to the future,"" she added. Earlier, King Willem-Alexander said it ""saddens us"" to see the UK leave the EU but ""Brexit does not mean farewell"". The king reiterated the comments in a speech at the banquet, but stressed he respected the decision of the 2016 referendum. He also went on to praise the Queen, describing her as ""most fearless Bond Girl ever"" as he referred to the film shown at the London 2012 Olympics opening ceremony in which the monarch featured alongside 007 actor Daniel Craig. The king and his wife Queen Maxima are taking part in a state visit to the UK. Dutch flying monarch regrets Brexit turbulence As UK politics continues to be dominated and divided by Brexit, the Queen touched on Britain's departure from the EU next March in her speech at Buckingham Palace. She referred to the state visit of the king's grandmother, Queen Juliana, in 1972. Recalling her speech on that occasion, the Queen said she had mentioned the two nations' relationship would become ""increasingly important as a new configuration of Europe was emerging"". She then added: ""As we look toward a new partnership with Europe, it is our shared values and commitment to each other, that are our greatest asset."" Theresa May walks with the Duke of Cambridge at the state banquet The Duchess of Cambridge with Dutch representative Rear Admiral Ludger Brummelaar Prime Minister Theresa May, the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall, and the Duke of Cambridge were at the banquet, along with senior members of the Cabinet and leading figures from British and Dutch life. Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn met the Dutch king earlier in the day and was represented by shadow foreign secretary Emily Thornberry. Earlier, the party viewed Dutch items from the Royal Collection at Buckingham Palace King Willem-Alexander addressed politicians in the Palace of Westminster's Royal Gallery Earlier, the Dutch royals were escorted by the Prince of Wales and the Duchess of Cornwall from the Dutch embassy to Whitehall. Speaking in the Palace of Westminster's Royal Gallery, to an audience including Mrs May, Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt and Home Secretary Sajid Javid, King Willem-Alexander said 100,000 Dutch citizens in Britain and the 50,000 Britons living in the Netherlands were valued as ""employees, colleagues, neighbours or volunteers"". ""They feel at home in their local community and their contribution to society is valued, whether as employees, colleagues, neighbours or volunteers,"" he said. ""Every day they prove how good the match is between the British and the Dutch. ""Yet all these individuals now live under the shadow of uncertainty about their future status. ""I understand how difficult this is for them and I trust this uncertainty will be resolved."" The UK government has promised to guarantee the rights of EU nationals after Brexit, even in the absence of a deal with the EU.

'On-time' renters get better credit score,"Hundreds of thousands of people who pay their rent on time are set to benefit from better credit scores. Credit reference agency Experian said it was now taking account of the payment habits of 1.2 million tenants. The vast majority of those - some 79% - stand to improve their credit scores and so get better access to bank accounts, loans and mortgages. Until now, most renters have not been able to prove that they are likely to meet their monthly mortgage payments. Last year, nearly 150,000 people signed a petition demanding better recognition of tenants who pay their rent on time. Rent record should help you get a mortgage Tenants unfairly miss out on credit A debate on the issue was held in Parliament. Afterwards, a Treasury minister, Stephen Barclay, said loan providers should look more favourably on those who kept up to date with their payments. Some 150 social housing providers have signed up to the scheme so far, calledthe Rental Exchange,external. As a result, most of those currently affected rent from housing associations or local authorities. However, those who rent from private landlords via letting agents can ask to have their payment data sent to the site. Nevertheless, anyone who has a poor record of paying rent on time could see their credit scores adversely affected - making it harder, or more expensive, to access other financial services. ""Tenants pay a significant amount of money each month for the roofs over their heads, so it's right to recognise these regular payments in a similar way as mortgages,"" said Clive Lawson, managing director of Experian Consumer Services. The Rental Exchange has been developed with the help of Big Issue Invest, the social investment arm of the Big Issue group. John Montague, the group's managing director, said, ""We set out with the aim of creating a fairer playing field for people accessing credit, because we recognised that people in poverty were routinely penalised.""

White nationalist faces wife abuse claims,"Richard Spencer popularised the term ""alt-right"" The wife of US white nationalist Richard Spencer has accused him of being ""physically, verbally and emotionally abusive"", US media report. In papers filing for divorce, Nina Koupriianova said on one occasion in 2011 Mr Spencer dragged her down the stairs, resulting in bruises. She said that in 2014 he again ""attacked"" her when she was four-months pregnant. In comments to the Associated Press, Mr Spencer denied being an abusive person. Richard Spencer is a figurehead for US far-right groups and popularised the term ""alternative right"". Richard Spencer: The white supremacist grateful for Trump Ms Koupriianova's divorce papers were filed in a Montana Court in June but werefirst reported by Buzzfeed News,externalon Tuesday. According to the report, Ms Koupriianova's lawyers said she had been ""reluctant to call police or seek an order of protection for fear of further reprisal"". ""Much of the abuse has occurred in the presence of the parties' children,"" the court documents said. Speaking to the Associated Press news agency on Tuesday, Mr Spencer said he was ""not an abusive person"" and that his wife was ""never in a dangerous situation"". Richard Spencer first rose to prominence when he led chants of ""Hail Trump"" to a Nazi-saluting group in Washington after the US president's election victory. He was also one of the organisers of a far-right rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, last year that left one woman dead. Facebook banned him from its platform earlier this year.

"Ford, Fiat and Nissan ads banned","Ford said its ad used the word ""rage"" but did not show road rage Three different carmakers have had ads banned for encouraging unsafe driving. Two ads for Ford Mustang cars fell foul of the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) after viewers complained that they showed driving as a way of releasing anger. The ASA also ruled against a Nissan Micra ad which it said depicted driving at excessive speeds. It also banned an ad showing four Fiat models because, it said, ""speed was the main message of the ad"". Ford said it had intended to show the Mustang as ""the antidote to a dull life"", while Nissan said its ad did not condone speeding and Fiat said its ad did not represent real-life driving conditions. The Ford ad, shown in cinemas and on the firm's YouTube channel, quoted a Dylan Thomas poem urging viewers to ""rage against the dying of the light"", while showing typical office frustrations such as a jammed photocopier and spilt coffee. Ford told the ASA that the word ""rage"" was not used to convey anger or aggression, but passion and enthusiasm. The ads did not show any scenes of road rage, it added. However, the ASA said the ad depicted characters releasing their anger while driving a Mustang and that the poem reinforced that ""by encouraging motorists to drive in an aggressive manner"". The Nissan ad, shown on TV, showed a car braking after a pedestrian stepped in front of it. Nissan said the purpose was to demonstrate the car's ""intelligent technology and safety features"". It added that the driver shown was ""at all times driving within the applicable speed limits"". However, the ASA said there was no indication in the ad of what those limits were. It said the ad ""implied the character had increased the speed of the vehicle because they were in a rush"". Fiat's ad, seen on YouTube, featured cars driving on a track which the carmaker said was ""designed to emulate the Hot Wheels children's toy cars game"". It said the ad was not targeted at UK consumers and was ""fantastical in nature"". The ASA said the ad had been served to UK consumers and the association with Hot Wheels ""would not be immediately obvious to or understood by many consumers"". The watchdog added that the ad ""portrayed the cars racing and being driven in a manner that condoned or encouraged unsafe or irresponsible driving"".

Summer baby school delays âa lotteryâ,"Parents who want to delay their child's first year of school have varying success rates depending on where they live, a BBC investigation has found. Thousands of families in England with summer-born babies are applying each year amid fears younger children do not perform as well as older classmates. But while some councils have approved 100% of requests, others have turned down more than half. Campaigners said a consistent approach was needed across the country. Children have traditionally been placed in school years according to their date of birth with a cut-off at the start of September. This has meant some children born in the summer have been almost a year younger than their eldest classmates when they start in reception. But parents of children born between 1 April and 31 August are now able to apply to put reception back a year. Figures supplied under the Freedom of Information Act show 2,243 requests were made to 110 local authorities in England to defer starts to the 2018 school year - 18% higher than the previous 12 months. But the rate of requests and their success rates varied considerably across England. Over a three-year period, Medway turned down 13 out of 17 applications and Wokingham rejected 12 out of 20. Nottingham and Manchester also both rejected more than half of the requests made. A third of councils who responded did not refuse any requests. These included Northamptonshire, which received 142 applications since 2016 and did not turn down any of them. Nottinghamshire, Liverpool, Wandsworth, York, Merton, Isle of Wight, Cheshire East, Cumbria and Shropshire were also among those with a 0% rejection rate. Jennie Blake, from Manchester, applied to Manchester City Council to request a delay in her son Nikolai starting school in September 2017, as his birthday was in May and she thought he was too young to start school. But after being turned down by the authority, the 38-year-old said her son later needed extra help at school because of his age. ""It would be so different if my son was under Cheshire East 20 minutes down the road, or in Liverpool,"" Ms Blake said. She said the council, which has rejected more than half of the requests made over three years, was ""messing with children's lives"". Ms Blake said she was now preparing the case to have her second child, now aged two, defer a year as they were born on 20 August. Manchester council's schools chief Councillor Luthfur Rahman, said the authority made decisions ""on the merits of each individual case"". ""After carefully considering Ms Blake's request, with input from Nikolai's nursery being sought, we were confident that the school could meet Nikolai's needs while educating him within his peer group."" Department for Education analysis has previously suggested it is typically more affluent familiesfrom white British backgrounds who make the requests, and those in areas where the council are more likely to agree to them. In a survey in 2017 of 161 families who successfully applied to delay the start of their child's schooling, the DfE found 47% had a household income of more than Â£50,000 a year. 'Don't ignore the children', government urged Eleven-plus pupils wrongly told 'you're in' Autistic boy 'mocked' by railway staff Of the 110 councils that responded to the BBC with comparable data, Haringey in London had the most requests with almost 18 for every 1,000 pupils for 2018, while in Devon there were about 15 requests per 1,000 pupils. Other areas received few applications - Doncaster only saw two across three years, while Rochdale said it had not received any requests at the time of responding. While the School Admissions Code requires councils to provide schooling for all children in the September following their fourth birthday, a child does not reach compulsory school age until the term after their fifth birthday. Julie McCulloch, director of policy at the Association of School and College Leaders, said: ""Some have a policy of automatically agreeing all requests, while others only agree requests where parents present very strong evidence. ""We think there should be a consistent approach across the country."" Dr Claire Crawford has researched summer-born children's attainment at school Dr Claire Crawford, from the University of Birmingham, has researched the attainment of summer-born children at school. She said: ""We found it [the attainment gap] was very large at the beginning of schooling as you might expect when the children are less mature, and the one year difference is a much bigger proportion of their lives."" She added: ""Some parents may be more able to apply to defer their child or have access to the research than others."" 'Don't ignore the children', government urged DFE caught adding tuition fees to school funding claims Clapping out, jazz hands in at university In 2015,schools minister Nick Gibb launched a reviewon allowing schools to admit summer-born children to reception class at the age of five, if their parents wanted this. TheSummer Born Campaign,externalhas called on the DfE to make it easier for summer-born children to start reception when at compulsory school age. Rosie Dutton, from The Summer Born Campaign, wants the government to legislate on the issue Spokeswoman Rosie Dutton said: ""It has been over three years since that letter was released by Nick Gibb, and in those three years many children have been forced to miss reception or start school before their parents wanted them to. ""We really need this legislation published quickly."" A DfE spokesman said: ""We have given councils clear advice on how to support parents who want to delay their child's admission to reception until compulsory school age so that families can make the right choice for their child."" He added research released in May suggested the majority of requests for delayed admissions were being agreed in line with parents' wishes.

Brexit plan to safeguard medicine supplies,"Ferry and freight firms will be urged to plan alternative routes for drugs and other vital supplies if a no-deal Brexit blocks cross-Channel traffic. The suppliers will be told to use Belgian and Dutch ports if blockages at Calais threaten to delay shipments. The news emerged after a ""passionate"" cabinet meeting in which ministers were told about contingencies for no deal. Meanwhile,a government watchdog is warning new UK border controls may not be readyin a no-deal situation. Cabinet ministers are receiving weekly updates about preparations for Brexit until the UK leaves the EU next March. Public may have to stockpile drugs in no-deal Brexit May says 95% of Brexit deal now agreed Brexit: All you need to know After Tuesday's cabinet meeting a senior government source denied there were plans to buy or charter vessels to keep the NHS working or to guarantee food supplies. Instead, private carriers would be expected to carry out their normal roles, the BBC has been told. But there are worries among ministers and officials that the sudden introduction of border checks at Calais could cause sudden and serious backlogs. The Sun reported that ministers,externalhad been warned that France could effectively shut down Calais, which it said would have a devastating effect on food exporters and manufacturers reliant on the port. And BBC Newsnight's political editor Nick Watt said there was a discussion at the cabinet meeting that there could be a 75-80% drop-off on traffic across the Calais-Dover route, causing a huge impact on supplies including food. Stockpiling of medicines that need refrigerating, such as insulin and vaccines, is difficult The BBC's deputy political editor, John Pienaar, said one source described the meeting as ""passionate"". Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt was said to have expressed concern that the UK must not be trapped indefinitely in the so-called ""backstop"" customs union arrangement with the EU, which could hamper the UK from striking wider trade deals. Reality Check: Back to the backstop Attorney General Geoffrey Cox compared that status to being trapped in Dante's ""first circle of hell"". The BBC's deputy political editor says the mood among ministers at the meeting was more evidence of the prime minister's limited room for manoeuvre in the Brexit talks, as she prepares to address Tory backbenchers on Wednesday. Theresa May's appearance before the 1922 Committee will see her face some MPs who have been critical of her Brexit plans and leadership. It comes as aNational Audit Office report,externalsays the the UK needs to replace IT systems, boost Border Force staffing levels and build new infrastructure to track goods. The government said it was confident of striking a ""good"" deal with the EU for as ""frictionless"" trade as possible. It said that plans were already 95% complete. The government has already asked firms to start stockpiling a six-week supply of drugs and if necessary plan to fly in medicines which cannot be stockpiled because of their short shelf life. The UK imports 37 million packs of medicine each month from the EU. Concern has been raised that prolonged disruption at the borders could disrupt the supply chain. Macron in English faux pas over visas Drug makers stockpiling for Brexit On Tuesday, Martin Sawer, of the Healthcare Distributors Association, told MPs that the pharmaceutical  industry was ""very concerned"" about a no-deal as it could have ""catastrophic"" consequences for the supply of drugs. He warned it could lead to patients being put on drugs that they are not currently prescribed. The Department for Transport said that while it was confident of the UK reaching an agreement with the EU on the terms of its exit, it was sensible to plan for all possible outcomes. ""We are continuing to work closely with partners on contingency plans to ensure that trade can continue to move as freely as possible between the UK and Europe,"" a spokesman said. But Labour MP David Lammy, who supports a new referendum on the outcome of the negotiations with the option of remaining in the EU, said Brexit had become ""like a declaration of war on ourselves"". France has also stepped up its planning for a no-deal Brexit, publishing a draft law last week which would give the government powers to deal with visas, transport and other services. The UK is due to leave on 29 March 2019 but during the post-Brexit ""transition period"", set to run until 31 December 2020, the UK-EU relationship will stay largely the same. Mrs May has insisted that if an extension is necessary it should only last a few months. However,the Times newspaper says a leaked document given to ministers warns the transition period,externaltying the UK to Brussels until the end of 2020 ""could, in theory"" turn into a long-running arrangement over ""many years"". A Downing Street spokesman said this was ""nothing more than a partial reflection of advice to ministers, and not of decisions taken"". He saidMrs May had made her position ""absolutely clear"" on Monday when she told the Commonsshe intended any such backstop arrangement to be temporary, and would end ""well before"" the next election.

China's hidden camps," On 12 July 2015 a satellite swung over the rolling deserts and oasis cities of China's vast far west. One of the images it captured that day just shows a patch of empty, untouched, ashen-grey sand. It seems an unlikely place to start an investigation into one of the most pressing human rights concerns of our age. But less than three years later, on 22 April 2018, a satellite photo of that same piece of desert showed something new. A massive, highly secure compound had materialised. It is enclosed with a 2km-long exterior wall punctuated by 16 guard towers. The first reports that China was operating a system of internment camps for Muslims in Xinjiang began to emerge last year. The satellite photograph was discovered by researchers looking for evidence of that system on the global mapping software, Google Earth. It places the site just outside the small town of Dabancheng, about an hour's drive from the provincial capital, Urumqi. To try to avoid the suffocating police scrutiny that awaits every visiting journalist, we land at Urumqi airport in the early hours of the morning. But by the time we arrive in Dabancheng we're being followed by at least five cars, containing an assortment of uniformed and plain-clothes police officers and government officials. It's already clear that our plan to visit a dozen suspected camps over the course of the next few days is not going to be easy. As we drive up the wide approach road we know that sooner or later the convoy behind is going to try to stop us. While still a few hundred metres away, we see something unexpected. The wide expanse of dusty ground, shown on the satellite image to the east of the site, is empty no more. In its place, a huge extension project is taking shape. The site at Dabancheng seen from the road Like a mini-city sprouting from the desert and bristling with cranes, are row upon row of giant, grey buildings - all of them four storeys high. With our cameras rolling we try to capture the extent of the construction, but before we can go much further one of the police cars swings into action. Our car is stopped - we're told to turn off the cameras and to leave. But we've discovered something of significance - a huge amount of extra activity that has so far gone unnoticed by the outside world. In remote parts of the world, Google Earth images can take months or years to update. Other public sources of satellite photography however - like the European Space Agency's Sentinel database - provide much more frequent images, although they're of a much lower resolution. It is here that we find what we are looking for. An October 2018 Sentinel image shows just how much the site has grown compared with what we'd expected to see. What we suspected to be a big internment camp, now looks like an enormous one. And it is just one of many similar, large prison-type structures that have been built across Xinjiang in the past few years. Before our attempt to visit the site, we'd stopped in the centre of Dabancheng. It was impossible to speak openly to anyone - minders lurked menacingly close by and would aggressively debrief anyone who even exchanged a greeting with us. There are tens of thousands of people [at the ‘re-education school’]... They have some problems with their thoughts Instead, we telephoned random numbers in the town. What was this large complex with its 16 watchtowers that the authorities were so desperate to stop us filming? “It's a re-education school,” one hotelier told us. “Yes, that's a re-education school,” another shopkeeper agreed. “There are tens of thousands of people there now. They have some problems with their thoughts.” This giant facility would of course fit no objective definition of a school. In Xinjiang “going to school” has come to take on a meaning all of its own. A still from a Chinese state TV report on the Uighur “schools” China has consistently denied that it is locking up Muslims without trial. Images from Chinese state TV show life inside the ""schools"" But a euphemism for the camps has long existed - education. Almost certainly as a response to the mounting international criticism, the authorities have begun to double down on this description, with a full-on propaganda drive. State-run TV has been showing glossy reports, full of clean classrooms and grateful students, apparently willingly submitting themselves to the coursework. There is no mention of the grounds on which the students have been chosen for this “study” or how long the courses last. But there are clues. The interviews sound more like confessions. “I have deeply understood my own mistakes,” one man tells the camera, vowing to be a good citizen “after I get home”. The main purpose of these facilities, we're told, is to combat extremism, through a mixture of legal theory, work skills and Chinese language training. That last item shows that whatever you want to call them - schools or camps - the intended target is the same. The facilities are exclusively for Xinjiang's Muslim minorities, many of whom do not speak Chinese as their mother tongue. The video suggests the school is operating a dress code - not a single one of the female students is wearing a headscarf. There are more than 10 million Uighurs in Xinjiang. They speak a Turkic language and resemble the peoples of Central Asia at least as much as they do China's majority population, the Han Chinese. The southern city of Kashgar, it is often pointed out, is geographically closer to Baghdad than it is to Beijing - and it sometimes feels culturally closer too. And with a history of rebellion and resistance to Chinese rule, the relationship between the Uighurs and their modern-day political masters has long been as fraught as it is distant. Before Communist rule, Xinjiang occasionally slipped from China's grip with brief periods of independence.  Ever since, it has constantly tested that grip with sporadic outbreaks of protest and violence. The mineral wealth - in particular oil and gas - of a region almost five times the size of Germany has brought huge levels of Chinese investment, rapid economic growth and large waves of Han Chinese settlers. Resentment among Uighurs over the perceived uneven distribution of the proceeds of that growth has simmered. In response to such criticisms, the Chinese authorities point to rising living standards for Xinjiang's residents. But in the past decade or so, hundreds of lives have been lost to a mixture of riots, inter-community violence, premeditated attacks and the police response. October 2013: Tiananmen Square sealed off after a car attack which killed two people In 2013, an attack on pedestrians in Beijing's Tiananmen Square, which claimed two lives as well as the three Uighur occupants of the car, marked a significant moment. Although relatively small in terms of fatalities it rattled the foundations of the Chinese state. March 2014: Police in Kunming on patrol after the killing of 31 people The following year, 31 people were slaughtered by knife-wielding Uighur attackers at a train station in the Chinese city of Kunming, more than 2000km away from Xinjiang. Over the past four years, Xinjiang has been the target of some of the most restrictive and comprehensive security measures ever deployed by a state against its own people. These include the large-scale use of technology - facial recognition cameras, monitoring devices that read the content of mobile phones and the mass collection of biometric data. Harsh new legal penalties have been introduced to curtail Islamic identity and practice - banning, among other things, long beards and headscarves, the religious instruction of children, and even Islamic-sounding names. The policies appear to mark a fundamental shift in official thinking - separatism is no longer framed as a problem of a few isolated individuals, but as a problem inherent within Uighur culture and Islam in general. It coincides with a tightening grip on society under President Xi Jinping, in which loyalties to family and faith must be subordinate to the only one that matters - loyalty to the Communist Party. The Uighurs' unique identity makes them a target for suspicion. That view has been reinforced by credible reports that hundreds have travelled to Syria to fight with various militant groups. Uighurs are now subject to ethnic profiling at thousands of pedestrian and vehicle checkpoints while Han Chinese residents are often waved through. A police checkpoint in Kashgar, March 2017 They face severe travel restrictions, both within Xinjiang and beyond, with an edict forcing residents to surrender all passports to the police for “safe keeping”. Uighur government officials are prohibited from practising Islam, from attending mosques or from fasting during Ramadan. A Chinese flag flies above a closed mosque in the Xinjiang city of Kashgar Given all this, it is perhaps not that surprising that China has introduced another older and blunter solution to the perceived disloyalty of many of its Uighur citizens. Despite the government's denials, the most compelling evidence for the existence of the internment camps comes from a trove of information from the authorities themselves. Pages of local government tendering documents inviting potential contractors and suppliers to bid for the building projects have been discovered online by the German-based academic, Adrian Zenz. They provide details about the construction or conversion of dozens of separate facilities across Xinjiang. In many cases the tenders call for the installation of comprehensive security features, such as watchtowers, razor wire, surveillance systems, and guardrooms. Cross-referencing this information with other media sources, Zenz suggests that at least several hundred thousand and possibly over a million Uighurs and other Muslim minorities could have been interned for re-education. The documents, of course, never refer to the facilities as internment camps, but as education centres, or in a more accurate translation, “re-education centres”. One of them almost certainly relates to the giant site we visited - a July 2017 tender for the installation of a heating system in a “transformation through education school” somewhere in the district of Dabancheng. In these euphemisms, and in the mundane measurements and quantities described, there is the unmistakable substance of a rapidly expanding network of mass confinement. In 2002, Reyila Abulaiti travelled from Xinjiang to the UK to study. She met and married a British man, took British citizenship and started a family. Last year, her mother came for her usual summer visit, spending time with her daughter and grandson and doing a bit of London sightseeing. Xiamuxinuer Pida, 66, is a well-educated former-engineer with a long service record at a Chinese state company. Xiamuxinuer Pida She flew back to Xinjiang on 2 June. Having not heard from her, Reyila called to check she'd got home OK. The conversation was brief and terrifying. “She told me that the police were searching the house,” Reyila remembers. It was Reyila who appeared to be the target of the investigation. She needed to send copies of her documents, her mother said - proof of UK address, a copy of her British passport, her UK telephone numbers and information about her university course. Reyila Abulaiti And then, after asking her to send them via a Chinese mobile chat service, Xiamuxinuer said something that sent a chill down Reyila's spine. “Don't call me again,” her mother told her. “Don't call me ever.” It was the last time her daughter would hear her voice. She believes she has been in a camp ever since. “My mum has been detained for no reason,” she says. “As far as I know, the Chinese government wants to delete Uighur identity from the world.” The BBC has conducted lengthy interviews with eight Uighurs living overseas. Their testimonies are remarkably consistent, providing evidence of the conditions and routines inside the camps and the broad basis on which people are detained. Mainstream religious activity, the mildest dissent and any link with Uighurs living in foreign countries appear to be enough to sweep people into the system. Ablet Tursun Tohti Each morning, when 29-year-old Ablet Tursun Tohti was woken an hour before sunrise, he and his fellow detainees had one minute to get to the exercise yard. After lining up, they were made to run. “There was a special room to punish those who didn't run fast enough,” Ablet says. “There were two men there, one to beat with a belt, the other just to kick.” The exercise yard can clearly be seen on the satellite photo of the camp where he says he was held, in the oasis town of Hotan in southern Xinjiang. “We sang the song called ‘Without the Communist Party There Can Be No New China,’” Ablet says. “And they taught us laws. If you couldn't recite them in the correct way, you'd be beaten.” A 2018 satellite image showing a camp in Hotan where Ablet says he was detained He was there for a month in late 2015 and, in some ways, he is one of the lucky ones. In the early days of the internment camps, the lengths of the re-education “courses” appear to have been shorter. Over the past two years there are very few reports ofanyone being released at all. There is no-one left outside And since there has now been a mass recall of passports, Ablet was one of the last Uighurs able to leave China. He has sought refuge in Turkey, a country with a sizeable Uighur diaspora because of strong cultural and linguistic links. Ablet tells me that his 74-year-old father and eight of his siblings are in the camps. “There is no-one left outside,” he says. Abdusalam Muhemet, 41, is also now living in Turkey. He was detained by the police in Xinjiang in 2014 for reciting an Islamic verse at a funeral. They eventually decided not to charge him, he says, but he still wasn't free. Abdusalam Muhemet “They told me I needed to be educated,” he explains. The facility he found himself in did not look like a school. On the satellite photo, you can make out the guard towers and the double perimeter fencing of the Han'airike Legal Education Training Centre. The rolls of razor wire can be identified from the shadows they cast under the harsh desert sun. He describes the same routine of exercise, bullying and brainwashing. Satellite image of the site in Hotan where Abdusalam says he was held Twenty-five-year-old Ali, not his real name, is one of those too scared to talk openly. In 2015 he says he ended up in a camp after the police found a picture of woman wearing a niqab, a face veil, on his mobile phone. “One old lady was there for having made a pilgrimage to Mecca,” he tells me, “and an old man for not paying his water bill on time.” Ali (not his real name) is unwilling to be identified During one of the forced exercise sessions an official’s car entered the camp and the gate was briefly left open. “Suddenly, a small child ran in towards his mother who was running with us. “She went towards her child, embraced him and started crying. “Then a policeman grabbed the woman by her hair and dragged the small child out of the camp.” In place of clean surroundings shown on state TV, a very different picture emerges. “The doors of our dormitories were locked at night,” Ablet says. But there were no toilets inside, they just gave us a bowl.” There is no way of independently verifying these accounts. We asked the Chinese government about the allegations of abuse but have received no reply. For Uighurs outside Xinjiang news has almost completely dried up. Fear breeds silence. Reports of people being deleted from family chat groups, or told never to call again, are now commonplace. Two of the things most central to Uighur culture - faith and family - are being systematically broken. As a result of the detention of whole extended families, there are reports that many children are being placed in state orphanages. Bilkiz Hibibullah arrived in Turkey in 2016 with five of her children. Bilkiz Hibibullah Her youngest daughter, Sekine Hasan, who by now would be three and a half years old, stayed in Xinjiang with Bilkiz's husband. She did not yet have a passport and the plan was that, when she got one, the family would reunite in Istanbul. She never got that passport. Bilkiz's daughter Sekine, whom she has not seen for more than two years Bilkiz believes her husband was detained on 20 March last year. She has since lost contact with the rest of her family and now has no idea where her daughter is. “In the middle of the night, after my other children have gone to bed, I cry a lot,” she says. “There is nothing more miserable than not knowing where your daughter is, if she is alive or dead. “If she could hear me now, I'd say nothing but sorry.” Satellite image of site in Hotan enhanced by GMV Using only publicly available, open-source satellite data, it's possible to shed light on Xinjiang's dark secret. GMV is a multinational aerospace company with experience of monitoring infrastructure from space on behalf of organisations like the European Space Agency and the European Commission. Their analysts went through a list of 101 facilities located across Xinjiang - drawn up from the various media reports and academic research about the re-education camp system. One by one, they measured the growth of new sites and the expansion of existing ones. They identified and compared common features such as watchtowers and security fencing - the kind of things needed to monitor and control the movement of people. And they categorised the likelihood of each site actually being a security facility, placing 44 of them in the high or very high category. Then they plotted the first detection by satellite of each of those 44 facilities over time. Images show the extent of the building work that has taken place at part of the camp where Abdusalem Muhemet was held. GMV cannot say what the sites are being used for. But it is clear that over the past few years China has been building a lot of new security facilities, at remarkable and increasing speed. It is likely to be an underestimate of the true picture. There is a striking conclusion - the recent trend is towards larger facilities. The number of new construction projects this year has fallen when compared with 2017. However, in terms of overall surface area of the facilities being built, there is more this year than last. GMV calculates that, from this set of 44 sites alone, the surface area of secure facilities in Xinjiang has expanded by some 440 hectares since 2003. This measurement refers to the whole site within the external security walls, not just the buildings. But 440 hectares represents a lot of additional space. For context, a 14-hectare site within the city of Los Angeles – containing the Twin Towers Correctional Facility and the Men's Central Jail - holds a combined total of almost 7,000 prisoners. Twin Towers Correctional Facility, Los Angeles We took one of GMV's findings - the increase in building size at the facility in Dabancheng - and showed it to a team with long experience in prison design at the Australian-based Guymer Bailey Architects. Using the measurements from the satellite images they calculated that, at an absolute minimum, the facility could provide space for about 11,000 detainees. Even that minimum estimate would place it alongside some of the biggest prisons in the world. Riker's Island in New York, the largest in the US, has space for 10,000 prisoners. Silivri Prison outside Istanbul, often referred to as Europe's largest, is designed to house 11,000. Guymer Bailey Architects (GBA) provided us with this analysis of the possible functions of the various buildings on the site. Their minimum estimate for occupancy at Dabancheng assumes that the detainees are held only in single rooms. If dormitories were used instead then the total capacity at Dabancheng would increase dramatically, GBA suggests, with an outer limit of about 130,000. It appears as a place designed to pack as many people into as small an area as possible We also showed the images to Raphael Sperry, an architect and the president of the US-based organisation, Architects/Designers/Planners for Social Responsibility. “This is a truly massive and bleak detention facility,” he told me. “It appears as a place designed to pack as many people into as small an area as possible at the lowest construction cost. “I think 11,000 is likely a significant underestimate... From the available information we can't tell how the interior is configured or what portion of the buildings is used for detention rather than other functions. Even so, your dormitory estimate of 130,000 people seems, sadly, quite possible.” The lack of access to the site means there's no way of independently verifying this analysis. We asked the authorities in Xinjiang to confirm what the site at Dabancheng is used for but have received no response. The padlocked door to a house in the city of Kashgar Not all of Xinjiang's internment camps are the same. Yining Number 3 Middle School is now believed to be a detention centre Some of the secure facilities have not been built from scratch, but are conversions of structures previously used for other purposes, like schools or factories. These are often smaller and located closer to the centre of towns or cities. In the northern county of Yining we tried to visit a number of such camps. We'd seen local government procurement documents for a project to create five “vocational skills education training centres” for the purposes of “safeguarding stability”. In the centre of town we stop outside a large group of buildings that used to be Yining Number 3 Middle School. A high, solid blue steel fence now surrounds the site and there's heavy security on the front gate. There's a new watchtower by the playground and another one by what used to be the football pitch. The pitch is now completely covered by six long steel-roofed buildings. Outside, visiting family members are queueing up at the security check. Once again, wherever we go in the town, two or three cars follow us. When we try to get out to film at one of the camps, this one surrounded by a grey fence, we're stopped. The officials, with hands over our camera lenses, tell us that there's important military training taking place in the area today and we're instructed to leave. Outside the former school we see a family, a mother and two children, standing quietly by the fence. One of the minders tries to stop them from talking but another appears to over-rule him. “Let them speak,” she says. I ask them whom they're visiting. There's a pause, before the young boy answers, “My dad”. The hands cover our lenses once again. In the city of Kashgar, the once bustling, beating heart of Uighur culture, the narrow streets are eerily quiet. Many of the doors are padlocked shut. On one, we see a notice instructing people how to respond to questions about where their family members have gone. “Say they're being looked after for the good of society and their families,” it says. The city's main mosque is more like a museum. We try to find out when the next prayer time is but no-one seems to be able to tell us. “I'm just here to deal with tourists,” one official tells us. “I don't know anything about prayer times.” In the square, a few beardless old men sit chatting. We ask them where everyone else is. One of them gestures to his mouth, holding his lips together to signal that it's too risky for him to talk to journalists. But the other whispers: “No-one comes anymore.” A helmeted policeman, some distance away, is cleaning the mosque steps. In the silence we can hear the sound of the slop of the water in the bucket and the swish of the mop, echoing across the square. Chinese tourists are taking photos. We leave Kashgar on the highway, heading southwest towards an area dotted with Uighur villages and farms, and a great many suspected camps. We're being followed as usual but soon we run into an unexpected obstacle. Ahead of us, the highway appears to have just been closed. The police officers manning the roadblock tell us that surface of the road has melted in the hot sun. “It's not safe to proceed,” they say. We notice that the other cars are being directed into a car park in a shopping mall, and over the radio, we hear instructions to hold them there “for a while”. We're told the wait could be four or five hours and we're advised to turn around. We look for alternative routes, but another roadblock always seems to materialise, although the explanations change. One road is closed for “military training”. Four times, on four separate roads, we're turned around before we finally have to admit defeat. Just a few kilometres away lies another giant camp said to hold around 10,000 people. There are Uighurs in positions of authority in Xinjiang. Many of the government officials and police officers who tailed and stopped us were Uighurs. If they feel in any way conflicted they cannot say it of course. A wall poster in Xinjiang reads: “Stability is a blessing, instability is a calamity” But while the system of profiling and control has been likened by some to Apartheid, clearly that is not entirely accurate. Many Uighurs do have a stake in the system. In reality a better parallel can be found in China's own totalitarian past. As in the Cultural Revolution, a society is being told that it needs to be taken apart in order to be saved. Shohrat Zakir, a Uighur and, in theory, the second most powerful politician in the region, suggests the battle has almost been won. Shohrat Zakir is the chairman of Xinjiang province and an ethnic Uighur “In the past 21 months, no violent terrorist attacks have occurred and the number of criminal cases, including those endangering public security, has dropped significantly,” he is reported to have told state media. “Xinjiang is not only beautiful but also safe and stable.” But when the detainees are released, what then? The former camp inmates we spoke to were all burning with resentment. And the world has yet to hear from anyone who has spent time in facilities like Dabancheng, the sinister and secretive facility of such immense proportions. Our reporting adds to the evidence that the mass re-education programme is internment by any other name - the locking up of many thousands of Muslims without trial or charge, in fact with no access to any legal process at all. China is already proclaiming it to be a success. But history holds many troubling precedents about where such a project might end up. Built with Shorthand"

Car ads banned for encouraging unsafe driving,"Ford said its ad used the word ""rage"" but did not show road rage Three different carmakers have had ads banned for encouraging unsafe driving. Two ads for Ford Mustang cars fell foul of the Advertising Standards Authority (ASA) after viewers complained that they showed driving as a way of releasing anger. The ASA also ruled against a Nissan Micra ad which it said depicted driving at excessive speeds. It also banned an ad showing four Fiat models because, it said, ""speed was the main message of the ad"". Ford said it had intended to show the Mustang as ""the antidote to a dull life"", while Nissan said its ad did not condone speeding and Fiat said its ad did not represent real-life driving conditions. The Ford ad, shown in cinemas and on the firm's YouTube channel, quoted a Dylan Thomas poem urging viewers to ""rage against the dying of the light"", while showing typical office frustrations such as a jammed photocopier and spilt coffee. Ford told the ASA that the word ""rage"" was not used to convey anger or aggression, but passion and enthusiasm. The ads did not show any scenes of road rage, it added. However, the ASA said the ad depicted characters releasing their anger while driving a Mustang and that the poem reinforced that ""by encouraging motorists to drive in an aggressive manner"". The Nissan ad, shown on TV, showed a car braking after a pedestrian stepped in front of it. Nissan said the purpose was to demonstrate the car's ""intelligent technology and safety features"". It added that the driver shown was ""at all times driving within the applicable speed limits"". However, the ASA said there was no indication in the ad of what those limits were. It said the ad ""implied the character had increased the speed of the vehicle because they were in a rush"". Fiat's ad, seen on YouTube, featured cars driving on a track which the carmaker said was ""designed to emulate the Hot Wheels children's toy cars game"". It said the ad was not targeted at UK consumers and was ""fantastical in nature"". The ASA said the ad had been served to UK consumers and the association with Hot Wheels ""would not be immediately obvious to or understood by many consumers"". The watchdog added that the ad ""portrayed the cars racing and being driven in a manner that condoned or encouraged unsafe or irresponsible driving"".
