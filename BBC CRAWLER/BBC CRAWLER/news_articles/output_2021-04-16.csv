"Tickets being sold for shows that can't take placeShows by Alicia Keys, Haim and Mrs Brown's Boys won't go ahead as planned this June.","Alicia Keys' dates in Manchester, London and Birmingham won't go ahead this June Tickets for arena shows by Alicia Keys, Haim and Mrs Brown's Boys in June are still on sale despite the fact they can't go ahead as planned under the government reopening roadmap. In February,the government saidfull-capacity indoor events would not return in England until at least 21 June. But on Friday, tickets remained on sale to see Keys, Haim, Mrs Brown's Boys and more stars on tour before that date. Fans can only get refunds if shows are officially rescheduled or cancelled. Keys is scheduled to play in Manchester, London and Birmingham from 6-10 June - dates that have already been rescheduled once. Her spokeswoman confirmed the tour will not happen this June. Tickets are still on sale for The Mrs Brown's Boys tour from 7 June The English leg of the Mrs Brown's Boys comedy tour is scheduled to start in Hull on 7 June. A spokeswoman said they are likely to announce new plans next week. Meanwhile, US trio Haim are due to play in Manchester, London and Nottingham from 15 June. Any such shows are not expected to go ahead with smaller, socially-distanced crowds, which could be allowed from 17 May. Haim fan Kat Hakin has paid Â£95 for two tickets to see the band at the O2 Arena. ""The biggest problem is they're still selling tickets for a date that they know that's not going to happen,"" she said. Ms Hakin said her ticket app it is still showing the tickets as being valid for 18 June. ""There's no indication there that it's not going to happen,"" she said. Haim recently performed at the Grammy Awards, but won't be travelling to the UK soon ""I'm frustrated at not being able to make my plans. I don't expect the concert to go ahead on the 18th at all, but I'm not about to make other plans, just in case. I've got to travel and get accommodation for that date, so I don't want to be doing that at last minute, should Boris [Johnson] bring the opening date forward, which I really can't see."" Julian Knight MP, chair of the House of Commons culture select committee, said it was ""concerning"" that tickets were still on sale for events that would not take place as planned. ""People who've already bought tickets should be able to get a refund, there is no reason for concerts organisers to hang on their cash,"" he said. ""The 'not before' roadmap date of 21 June has given the industry the clarity it was waiting for - now is the time for the industry to do the responsible thing."" Adam French, senior consumer rights editor at Which?, said: ""These events should be taken off sale. ""Consumers should also be advised not to buy tickets until new dates are confirmed, otherwise they could lose out on the cost of booking fees in any refund they are due if they cannot make the new dates."" Ticket sites and venues must wait for promoters to instruct them to move or remove shows from their listings. Promoters Live Nation said on Thursday that announcements about shows scheduled for before 21 June involving Keys, Haim and more were ""imminent"". Fellow promoters SJM said: ""The planned dates for Mrs Browns Boys will not be able to happen this summer as a result of the ongoing restrictions related to the global pandemic. We are working to reschedule the tour and will have news for all fans shortly. All customers should hold on to their tickets and as soon as new dates are confirmed we will let them know and the dates will be publicised."" A spokeswoman for the O2 Arena said they were waiting to hear from Live Nation and SJM. A spokeswoman for Nottingham's Motorpoint Arena, where Haim are due to play on 19 June, said they were ""awaiting information from the promoter"". A message on the website of Manchester's AO Arena,external, which is due to host Keys' first UK date, said the venue was ""continuing to liaise with promoters and event organisers of all shows that are scheduled to take place before the 21 June 2021, expecting more changes to the events calendar"". The Eventim Apollo in Hammersmith, London, where Mrs Brown's Boys are scheduled to appear on 11 and 12 June, said it was ""waiting on confirmation from the event promoters on when this event is postponing to"" and that ""the event will not be socially distanced, it would have to postpone to a date where it can take place at full capacity"". A spokesman for Blackpool Opera House, where Mrs Brown's Boys are in the diary from 14-16 June, said they were ""awaiting an update from the show's promoters"".

Philip's funeral to mark his 'unwavering loyalty',"This video can not be played Prince Philipâs funeral as it happened. The Duke of Edinburgh has been laid to rest in an intimate funeral at St George's Chapel at Windsor Castle. The Dean of Windsor paid tribute to Prince Philip's ""kindness, humour and humanity"" during the ceremony. The congregation wore masks and was socially distanced in line with Covid rules, with the Queen seated alone. The duke's children walked behind his coffin in a funeral procession, followed by a national minute's silence. More than 730 members of the armed forces took part in the event, but there was a limit of 30 mourners inside St George's Chapel, under coronavirus rules. As it happened: Prince Philip laid to rest In Pictures: The Queen and nation bid farewell Small touches that showed it was Philip's funeral Alone but for the gaze of the world The Land Rover hearse Prince Philip designed Prince Philip died at Windsor Castle on Friday 9 April, aged 99. His coffin was carried the short distance to St George's Chapel on a modified Land Rover, which the duke himself helped to design. The funeral procession was headed by the Band of the Grenadier Guards, the Major General's party, and military service chiefs. Princess Anne and Prince Charles made up the front row behind the vehicle, followed by Prince Edward and Prince Andrew. Prince William and Prince Harry walked either side of their cousin Peter Phillips. The brothers sat on opposite sides of the aisle but were seen chatting together after they left the service. The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge were seen chatting with the Duke of Sussex after the service The Queen sat alone because of coronavirus restrictions Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence and the Earl of Snowdon also walked behind the coffin, trailed by members of the duke's household staff. The Queen, 94, travelled with a lady-in-waiting in the State Bentley at the end of the procession. Members of the Royal Family walked behind the duke's coffin A ceremonial gun fire at nine locations across the UK and in Gibraltar marked the start and end of the national minute's silence. No planes landed or took off at Heathrow for six minutes to coincide with the silence and all major sporting events were rescheduled to avoid a clash with the funeral. This video can not be played A national minute's silence was held at 15:00 BST The funeral service was conducted by the Dean of Windsor, with the Archbishop of Canterbury pronouncing the blessing. The Dean paid tribute to Prince Philip's ""kindness, humour and humanity"" and the ""many ways in which his long life has been a blessing to us"". ""We have been inspired by his unwavering loyalty to our Queen, by his service to the nation and the Commonwealth, by his courage, fortitude and faith,"" he said during his bidding. The order of service for Prince Philip's funeral Attenborough praises Prince Philip's conservation ""passion"" Royal Family tree and line of succession The duke's association with the Royal Navy and love of the sea was also a focus of the service but no sermon was delivered, in line with his wishes. The music included the 1860 hymn Eternal Father, Strong to Save, by William Whiting, which is associated with seafarers and the maritime armed services. There was a reduced choir of four singers but the congregation did not sing, in line with coronavirus restrictions. Buglers of the Royal Marines sounded Action Stations - a signal that all hands should be ready for battle - as the coffin was lowered into the Royal Vault at the end of the service. The duke's insignia was displayed on the altar in St George's Chapel Buckingham Palace said the funeral plans had been modified to take into account public health guidelines. The funeral took place entirely within the grounds of the castle and the public were asked not to gather there or at other royal residences. But the ceremonial aspects of the day and the service remained in line with Prince Philip's wishes and reflected his military affiliations and personal elements of his life. Ahead of the funeral, theQueen shared a favourite photographof herself with her husband in Aberdeenshire. Taken by the Countess of Wessex in 2003, the picture shows the couple relaxing on a picnic rug on the grass at the Coyles of Muick beauty spot, near the Queen's private estate of Balmoral. The Queen released one her favourite photos ahead of the funeral by BBC reporter Harry Farley Silence descended across Windsor High Street at 15:00 to mark the start of the duke's funeral. The Royal Family had asked members of the public to stay away because of coronavirus restrictions. And the streets of this town were far emptier than they would otherwise have been. But hundreds still gathered in the sun to pay their respects. As the funeral service was under way in St George's Chapel, a short distance away in Windsor's Guildhall a wedding was coming to an end. Mikey Durnian said he and his partner Jodie had rearranged their wedding five times because of the pandemic. He said it had felt ""strange"" to learn last week that their wedding would be taking place just metres away from Prince Philip's funeral. ""Obviously we're overjoyed. This day has been in the making a long time. But obviously, there's a lot of people around to mourn."" Jodie added: ""We definitely didn't want to overtake from anything that's happening today. It is a very sad occasion. But we are delighted to finally be married."" The30 guests at the funeralwore morning coats with medals, or day dress, but not military uniform. The Queen and duke's four children - the Prince of Wales, the Princess Royal, the Duke of York and the Earl of Wessex - and eight grandchildren attended, but none of their young great-grandchildren. Spouses of the children and grandchildren are among the congregation, including two who have married into the family in recent years - Jack Brooksbank and Edoardo Mapelli Mozzi, husbands of Princesses Eugenie and Beatrice. But the Duke of Sussex's wife, Meghan, is heavily pregnant and was advised by her doctors not to fly in from the US. She was said to have watched the service from home. The other mourners included the children of the Queen's sister, Princess Margaret, and three of Prince Philip's German relatives - Bernhard, the Hereditary Prince of Baden; Donatus, Prince and Landgrave of Hesse; and Prince Philipp of Hohenlohe-Langenburg.

RaÃºl Castro steps down as Cuban communist leader,"RaÃºl Castro made the announcement at the party congress RaÃºl Castro says he is resigning as Cuban Communist Party leader, ending his family's six decades in power. Mr Castro, 89, told a party congress that he is handing over the leadership to a younger generation ""full of passion and anti-imperialist spirit"". His successor will be voted in at the end of the four-day congress. The move, which was expected, ends the era of formal leadership by him and his brother Fidel Castro, which began with the 1959 revolution. ""I believe fervently in the strength and exemplary nature and comprehension of my compatriots,"" he told party delegates in Havana on Friday. In pictures: RaÃºl Castro's career over six decades Miguel DÃ­az-Canel: The expected successor Although Mr Castro has not endorsed a successor, it is widely believed the party leadership will pass to Miguel DÃ­az-Canel, who took over as the island's president in 2018. By Will Grant, Cuba Correspondent While the entire island knew this moment was coming, it was no less historic or symbolic when it arrived: Cuba will be officially governed by someone other than a Castro for the first time since 1959. The reality is that, at least in the short term, little will change. The man who took over from RaÃºl Castro as president, Miguel DÃ­az-Canel, may well succeed him now as the party's first secretary too. It seems likely he will be forced to take further steps to liberalise Cuba's centrally controlled economy. The island is currently in the grip of its worst economic crisis since the period immediately following the end of the Cold War. As a result, private farmers were recently permitted to sell beef and dairy products - goods previously under the sole control of the state. Any hope of improving ties with the US however may have to wait as the Biden administration has shown little inclination to unpick the Trump administration's harsher sanctions on Cuba at this stage. One thing is for sure, RaÃºl Castro's words of keeping ""one foot in the stirrup"" means he will remain a powerbroker behind the scenes. And by reiterating the island's eternal commitment to socialism it means that political change remains as unlikely under his successor as it was under his late brother, Fidel. RaÃºl Castro has been the party's secretary-general since succeeding his older brother, Fidel, in 2011. Fidel and RaÃºl Castro between them led Cuba for six decades Fidel Castro led the revolution that toppled the Cuban government in 1959, when RaÃºl served as one of his commanders. Fidel Castro was the country's leader until falling ill in 2006 and in 2008 handed over the presidency to his brother. Fidel Castro died in 2016. As leader, RaÃºl Castro maintained the communists' one-party grip on power. He oversaw an improvement in relations with United States between 2014 and 2016,including historic talks with President Barack Obama in 2016. Raul Castro (right) with then-US President Barack Obama in 2016 But tensions worsened under Donald Trump, who reinforced sanctions. Current US President Joe Biden has vowed to relax some of Trump's sanctions, although the White House said on Friday a shift in Cuban policy was not one of his top priorities. At the congress on Friday, RaÃºl Castro said his country was willing to ""develop respectful dialogue"" with the United States but it would not accept having to make ""concessions"" regarding its ""foreign policy and ideals"". The change at the top of Cuba's governing party comes as the island's leadership is tackling its most serious economic crisis in decades. The Covid-19 pandemic, financial reforms and restrictions imposed by the Trump administration have hit the economy, which shrank by 11% last year. President Miguel DÃ­az-Canel (left) is widely seen as the successor to RaÃºl Castro (right) A long-awaited currency reform launched on 1 January has sought to make the economy and state companies more efficient. But it has also badly squeezed the budgets of ordinary Cubans. Many have been calling for much more economic freedom in the country. Cubans get access to 3G mobile internet New constitution: What's in and what's out Miguel DÃ­az-Canel: The man succeeding the Castros All you need to know about Cuba Another challenge will be maintaining ideological unity and support in the face of citizens' increased access to the internet and social media. Dissidents have been using social media to stage anti-government protests and gather live audiences online. In response, the party has said one of the functions of its congress would be ""confronting political and ideological subversion, which has made internet and social media its principal field of operations"". This video can not be played Meet Cubaâs digital revolutionaries But despite the change in leadership, few expect it will prompt a dramatic change in policy direction. A new constitution in 2019 confirmed state dominance of the economyand the ""irrevocability of socialism"". In a tweet on Friday,,external60-year-old President DÃ­az-Canel said the congress would be where ""ideas are entrenched, history recognized and the future discussed."" But he added that there would be ""continuity"". Mr Castro told the congress he was retiring as ""a simple revolutionary fighter"". ""And as long as I live I will be ready with my foot in the stirrups to defend the fatherland, the revolution and socialism.""

Queen shares cherished Prince Philip photo,"The Queen has shared one of her favourite photographs of herself with her husband of 73 years, the Duke of Edinburgh, on the eve of his funeral. The royal couple are pictured relaxing on the grass at a beauty spot in Aberdeenshire in the photo taken by the Countess of Wessex in 2003. The duke is lying back, propping himself up on his elbow, with his hat balanced on his knee. His funeral will take place in Windsor Castle at 15:00 BST on Saturday. The duke's children will walk behind his hearse during the procession. Philip's funeral to mark his 'unwavering loyalty' A guide to Prince Philip's funeral Prince Philip funeral: What are the plans and timings? The Land Rover hearse Prince Philip designed In the photograph, taken on a sunny day at the Coyles of Muick near the Aberdeenshire town of Ballater, the Queen and Prince Philip look completely at ease and are smiling warmly at their daughter-in-law Sophie who took the photograph. The Queen - dressed in a tartan skirt, blouse and cardigan, and a string of pearls - is sitting on a rug with her husband. The Coyles of Muick stands above the entrance to Glen Muick and offers walkers an uninterrupted view to the mountain of Lochnagar. It is near to the Queen's private estate of Balmoral, where the couple enjoy their traditional summer break. The Queen has named a corgi puppy, recently given to the monarch, Muick, and its dorgi puppy playmate is called Fergus - another Scottish name. The area has been painted by the Prince of Wales, whose summer retreat of Birkhall is close to the area where the Queen and Philip were photographed. Meanwhile, Mike Tindall, who is married to the Queen and Prince Philip's granddaughter Zara Tindall, has paid tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh as a ""devoted family man who we will forever miss but always love"". The former England rugby player posted a picture on Instagram from the Royal Family's personal photo albums of the duke with the Tindalls' eldest daughter Mia. Allow Instagram content?

RaÃºl Castro steps down as Cuban communist leaderHis resignation ends his family's six-decade hold on power in Cuba.Latin America & Caribbean,"RaÃºl Castro made the announcement at the party congress RaÃºl Castro says he is resigning as Cuban Communist Party leader, ending his family's six decades in power. Mr Castro, 89, told a party congress that he is handing over the leadership to a younger generation ""full of passion and anti-imperialist spirit"". His successor will be voted in at the end of the four-day congress. The move, which was expected, ends the era of formal leadership by him and his brother Fidel Castro, which began with the 1959 revolution. ""I believe fervently in the strength and exemplary nature and comprehension of my compatriots,"" he told party delegates in Havana on Friday. In pictures: RaÃºl Castro's career over six decades Miguel DÃ­az-Canel: The expected successor Although Mr Castro has not endorsed a successor, it is widely believed the party leadership will pass to Miguel DÃ­az-Canel, who took over as the island's president in 2018. By Will Grant, Cuba Correspondent While the entire island knew this moment was coming, it was no less historic or symbolic when it arrived: Cuba will be officially governed by someone other than a Castro for the first time since 1959. The reality is that, at least in the short term, little will change. The man who took over from RaÃºl Castro as president, Miguel DÃ­az-Canel, may well succeed him now as the party's first secretary too. It seems likely he will be forced to take further steps to liberalise Cuba's centrally controlled economy. The island is currently in the grip of its worst economic crisis since the period immediately following the end of the Cold War. As a result, private farmers were recently permitted to sell beef and dairy products - goods previously under the sole control of the state. Any hope of improving ties with the US however may have to wait as the Biden administration has shown little inclination to unpick the Trump administration's harsher sanctions on Cuba at this stage. One thing is for sure, RaÃºl Castro's words of keeping ""one foot in the stirrup"" means he will remain a powerbroker behind the scenes. And by reiterating the island's eternal commitment to socialism it means that political change remains as unlikely under his successor as it was under his late brother, Fidel. RaÃºl Castro has been the party's secretary-general since succeeding his older brother, Fidel, in 2011. Fidel and RaÃºl Castro between them led Cuba for six decades Fidel Castro led the revolution that toppled the Cuban government in 1959, when RaÃºl served as one of his commanders. Fidel Castro was the country's leader until falling ill in 2006 and in 2008 handed over the presidency to his brother. Fidel Castro died in 2016. As leader, RaÃºl Castro maintained the communists' one-party grip on power. He oversaw an improvement in relations with United States between 2014 and 2016,including historic talks with President Barack Obama in 2016. Raul Castro (right) with then-US President Barack Obama in 2016 But tensions worsened under Donald Trump, who reinforced sanctions. Current US President Joe Biden has vowed to relax some of Trump's sanctions, although the White House said on Friday a shift in Cuban policy was not one of his top priorities. At the congress on Friday, RaÃºl Castro said his country was willing to ""develop respectful dialogue"" with the United States but it would not accept having to make ""concessions"" regarding its ""foreign policy and ideals"". The change at the top of Cuba's governing party comes as the island's leadership is tackling its most serious economic crisis in decades. The Covid-19 pandemic, financial reforms and restrictions imposed by the Trump administration have hit the economy, which shrank by 11% last year. President Miguel DÃ­az-Canel (left) is widely seen as the successor to RaÃºl Castro (right) A long-awaited currency reform launched on 1 January has sought to make the economy and state companies more efficient. But it has also badly squeezed the budgets of ordinary Cubans. Many have been calling for much more economic freedom in the country. Cubans get access to 3G mobile internet New constitution: What's in and what's out Miguel DÃ­az-Canel: The man succeeding the Castros All you need to know about Cuba Another challenge will be maintaining ideological unity and support in the face of citizens' increased access to the internet and social media. Dissidents have been using social media to stage anti-government protests and gather live audiences online. In response, the party has said one of the functions of its congress would be ""confronting political and ideological subversion, which has made internet and social media its principal field of operations"". This video can not be played Meet Cubaâs digital revolutionaries But despite the change in leadership, few expect it will prompt a dramatic change in policy direction. A new constitution in 2019 confirmed state dominance of the economyand the ""irrevocability of socialism"". In a tweet on Friday,,external60-year-old President DÃ­az-Canel said the congress would be where ""ideas are entrenched, history recognized and the future discussed."" But he added that there would be ""continuity"". Mr Castro told the congress he was retiring as ""a simple revolutionary fighter"". ""And as long as I live I will be ready with my foot in the stirrups to defend the fatherland, the revolution and socialism.""

"PM to visit India despite rise in its Covid casesA variant first identified in India has now been found 77 times in the UK, but is not yet ""of concern"".UK","Boris Johnson's visit to India will still go ahead later this month despite the country's soaring coronavirus cases and a new variant there, No 10 says. Public Health England says 73 cases of the variant first identified in India have been found in England and four in Scotland. Officials have called it a ""variant under investigation"" rather than ""of concern"". The PM had already scaled down his trip due to India's rising number of cases. The country has reported more than 150,000 Covid cases a day for the past three weeks. New 'double mutant' Covid variant found in India India's Covid-19 patients turn to black market South Africa coronavirus variant: What's the risk? Speaking about the prime minister's visit to India, a No 10 spokesman said the trip was already ""slightly shorter than it will have been"". Mr Johnson was due to spend four days in the south Asian country but after talks with Narendra Modi's administration, the ""bulk"" of meetings will take place on one day - Monday, 26 April. ""As you would expect, safety is obviously important and is a priority for us on this trip, which is why we will make sure that all elements of the visit are Covid-secure,"" the spokesman said. Public Health England has designated the B.1.617 variant as a ""variant under investigation"" and said there was currently no evidence to suggest it caused more severe disease or that vaccines were less likely to work against it. Officials said ""all appropriate public health interventions will be undertaken, including enhanced contact tracing"" after its detection, with PHE and international partners monitoring the situation ""closely"". By Philippa Roxby, health reporter, BBC News Viruses mutate all the time in a bid to survive. The challenge for scientists is to work out which mutations change how the coronavirus behaves. Do they alter how the virus spreads, for example, do they cause people to become more seriously ill, and could they evade the protection of vaccines? These are all questions experts will now try to answer about the Indian variant by carrying out experiments in the lab and looking at data on cases in the real world. So far, we know that it has two mutations - the first, E484Q is similar to one found in the Brazilian, South African and Kent variants - and the second, L452R has been found in a variant in California. That means it could be a concern based onwhat is known about those variants already. But the ""double mutation"" on its own isn't unusual and has been found in other variants. Covid vaccines are still very effective at reducing the risk of serious illness and manufacturers plan to update their vaccines in response to the most worrying new variants. Paul Hunter, professor of medicine at the University of East Anglia, said the variant first identified in India featured two ""escape mutations"" which ""are causing people to be concerned"". ""If you think about where the main variants have arisen - South Africa, the UK, California, Brazil, and now India - all of these are countries that have really struggled to keep case numbers down,"" Prof Hunter said. This video can not be played Why do new variants of Covid-19 keep appearing? BBC's health reporter Laura Foster explains ""So it's not surprising. India has got a huge pandemic, and therefore that's where you're going to be getting the variant."" Coronavirus cases have risen sharply in India in the past few weeks as the country battles a second wave. There have been more than 13.9 million confirmed coronavirus cases in India and 172,000 people have died. This video can not be played India coronavirus: ""A Covid tsunami we had never seen before"" The country is not on the UK government's ""red list"" for travel. This refuses entry to people who have been in those countries in the previous 10 days and means a 10-day hotel quarantine for British or Irish nationals, or people with UK residency rights, returning. Asked why India had not been put on the red list, Downing Street said the situation was ""under constant review"". ""We add and remove countries based on the latest scientific data and public health advice from a range of world-leading experts,"" a spokesman said.

Canada sounds the alarm as Covid cases overtake US,"Vaccination rollout in Canada got off to a slow start but is now picking up The rate of coronavirus infections in Canada's biggest province has reached an all-time high as hospitals warn they are close to being overwhelmed. A panel of experts say infections in Ontario could increase by 600% by June if public health measures are weak and vaccination rates do not pick up. Last week, for the first time since the pandemic began,Canada registered more cases per million than the US.,external About 22% of Canadians have now received a first vaccine dose. That compares to37% in the US,external. Ontario is now introducing strict new public measures, including: a six-week stay-at-home order restrictions on non-essential travel, including checkpoints at the borders with the neighbouring provinces of Quebec and Manitoba new powers for police to stop and question people who leave home a halt to non-essential construction Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the federal government would help Toronto, the largest city in the country, which has been hard-hit by the latest surge. ""We're going to do whatever it takes to help. Discussions are ongoing about extra healthcare providers, and we are ready to step up,"" he said on Friday. Covid infections in Canada edge closer to US rate Why Canada is falling behind in Covid vaccinations New variants - especially the UK variant, B1.1.7 - account for more than two-thirds of infections in Ontario. Even with vaccinations progressing, the expert panel warned that the number of new cases in Ontario could go as high as 30,000 a day - in a province with 14 million people, 38% of the total population of Canada. On Friday, Ontario reported 4,812 new cases, its third straight day of setting new records since the pandemic began. Hospital admissions and the number of patients in intensive care also set records for Ontario: 1,955 and 701, respectively. New restrictions on retail have been imposed in Ontario The expert panel said the best-case scenario would bring new cases down to about 5,000 a day, but only with considerably more stringent public health measures than the ones now in place. It would also require a vaccination rate of 300,000 a day - three times the current pace. Last week the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario warned doctors that they might have to start making decisions about who to admit to intensive care, because units were stretched almost to capacity. The co-chairman of Ontario's expert panel, Adalsteinn Brown, said Ontario's hospitals could no longer function normally. ""Our children's hospitals are admitting adults. This has never happened in Ontario before. It's never happened in Canada before."" A field hospital is now being set up in the car park of one of Toronto's main hospitals. After a slow start, the pace of vaccination is now picking up. Canada was quick to buy up stocks of vaccine doses, but until recently the rollout was lagging behind other industrialised countries. Nine million Canadians have now received at least one vaccine dose. There was mixed news on Friday. Moderna said it would cut its next shipment to Canada by almost half, to 650,000 doses, but Pfizer is to supply an additional eight million doses after it reached a new deal with the Canadian government. Unlike some European countries, Canada has not withdrawn the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, but is advising its use only in patients over 55 while the risk from blood clots is assessed. Canadian health officials say the risk from catching Covid-19 far outweighs the risk of rare blood clots. The Canadian Medical Association (CMA) has called for a national response, sharing resources across provincial and territorial boundaries to deliver to the areas most in need.

"Queen shares cherished Prince Philip photoShared on the eve of the duke's funeral, the photo shows them relaxing in the Scottish Highlands.UK","The Queen has shared one of her favourite photographs of herself with her husband of 73 years, the Duke of Edinburgh, on the eve of his funeral. The royal couple are pictured relaxing on the grass at a beauty spot in Aberdeenshire in the photo taken by the Countess of Wessex in 2003. The duke is lying back, propping himself up on his elbow, with his hat balanced on his knee. His funeral will take place in Windsor Castle at 15:00 BST on Saturday. The duke's children will walk behind his hearse during the procession. Philip's funeral to mark his 'unwavering loyalty' A guide to Prince Philip's funeral Prince Philip funeral: What are the plans and timings? The Land Rover hearse Prince Philip designed In the photograph, taken on a sunny day at the Coyles of Muick near the Aberdeenshire town of Ballater, the Queen and Prince Philip look completely at ease and are smiling warmly at their daughter-in-law Sophie who took the photograph. The Queen - dressed in a tartan skirt, blouse and cardigan, and a string of pearls - is sitting on a rug with her husband. The Coyles of Muick stands above the entrance to Glen Muick and offers walkers an uninterrupted view to the mountain of Lochnagar. It is near to the Queen's private estate of Balmoral, where the couple enjoy their traditional summer break. The Queen has named a corgi puppy, recently given to the monarch, Muick, and its dorgi puppy playmate is called Fergus - another Scottish name. The area has been painted by the Prince of Wales, whose summer retreat of Birkhall is close to the area where the Queen and Philip were photographed. Meanwhile, Mike Tindall, who is married to the Queen and Prince Philip's granddaughter Zara Tindall, has paid tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh as a ""devoted family man who we will forever miss but always love"".

Tickets being sold for shows that can't take place,"Alicia Keys' dates in Manchester, London and Birmingham won't go ahead this June Tickets for arena shows by Alicia Keys, Haim and Mrs Brown's Boys in June are still on sale despite the fact they can't go ahead as planned under the government reopening roadmap. In February,the government saidfull-capacity indoor events would not return in England until at least 21 June. But on Friday, tickets remained on sale to see Keys, Haim, Mrs Brown's Boys and more stars on tour before that date. Fans can only get refunds if shows are officially rescheduled or cancelled. Keys is scheduled to play in Manchester, London and Birmingham from 6-10 June - dates that have already been rescheduled once. Her spokeswoman confirmed the tour will not happen this June. Tickets are still on sale for The Mrs Brown's Boys tour from 7 June The English leg of the Mrs Brown's Boys comedy tour is scheduled to start in Hull on 7 June. A spokeswoman said they are likely to announce new plans next week. Meanwhile, US trio Haim are due to play in Manchester, London and Nottingham from 15 June. Any such shows are not expected to go ahead with smaller, socially-distanced crowds, which could be allowed from 17 May. Haim fan Kat Hakin has paid Â£95 for two tickets to see the band at the O2 Arena. ""The biggest problem is they're still selling tickets for a date that they know that's not going to happen,"" she said. Ms Hakin said her ticket app it is still showing the tickets as being valid for 18 June. ""There's no indication there that it's not going to happen,"" she said. Haim recently performed at the Grammy Awards, but won't be travelling to the UK soon ""I'm frustrated at not being able to make my plans. I don't expect the concert to go ahead on the 18th at all, but I'm not about to make other plans, just in case. I've got to travel and get accommodation for that date, so I don't want to be doing that at last minute, should Boris [Johnson] bring the opening date forward, which I really can't see."" Julian Knight MP, chair of the House of Commons culture select committee, said it was ""concerning"" that tickets were still on sale for events that would not take place as planned. ""People who've already bought tickets should be able to get a refund, there is no reason for concerts organisers to hang on their cash,"" he said. ""The 'not before' roadmap date of 21 June has given the industry the clarity it was waiting for - now is the time for the industry to do the responsible thing."" Adam French, senior consumer rights editor at Which?, said: ""These events should be taken off sale. ""Consumers should also be advised not to buy tickets until new dates are confirmed, otherwise they could lose out on the cost of booking fees in any refund they are due if they cannot make the new dates.""

Reward doubled to find 'world's longest rabbit',"It has been almost a week since Darius vanished from his enclosure A reward offered in a bid to trace an award-winning four-foot long rabbit stolen from his home is being doubled. Darius, a 12-year-old continental giant rabbit, vanished from Stoulton, Worcestershire, on Saturday night. Owner Annette Edwards said she was ""very upset"" and increased the reward to Â£2,000 amid concerns Darius would die if he was not returned home soon. She has enlisted a pet detective to help trace Darius, whose disappearance is also being probed by police. At 129cm (4ft 2in) long, Darius is a record holder after being named the world's longest living rabbit in 2010. Darius, pictured with one of his sons, is too old to breed now his owner said Ms Edwards runs a business breeding giant rabbits and Darius has sired many for customers who hope for a pet on a similar scale, however due to his age Ms Edwards said he has been retired from breeding for years. She credits his old age with a special diet and is concerned if he is not properly fed he is unlikely to survive. ""He's such an old boy,"" she said. ""If I don't get him back quickly, he's going to die. ""He doesn't run around, he's very slow,"" she added. ""If he gets dumped a fox would get him."" Latest news and updates from the West Midlands Continental giant rabbits normally only live for up to six years, leading to speculations on social media about whether it is possible for Darius to live to such an old age. Experts told the BBC while it was unheard of to them, they could not say it was impossible. As a result of the speculation, Ms Edwards has faced abuse on social media since his disappearance. ""People think it's a hoax,"" she said. ""It saddens me, but what can I do? At a time like this, how awful."" The former model has denied allegations Darius was insured for six-figure sums, indeed that he was insured at all, and said she has been vilified by certain online communities for years. As to why, Ms Edwards said she is not sure how to account for it, but being well-known in the rabbit breeding world leads her to put it down to jealousy. Rabbit breeding is largely unregulated in the UK - unlike with dogs, no licence is currently required. West Mercia Police said it is believed Darius was stolen from his enclosure, which is in his owners' garden, overnight on Saturday. So far, the force has not disclosed any updates on its investigation. The RSPCA said it was deeply concerned by reports pet theft was on the rise and said thieves are ""attracting large value to pets"" as demand soared during lockdown.

"Canada sounds the alarm as Covid cases overtake USInfections in the largest province could increase sixfold without tougher measures, experts warn.US & Canada","Vaccination rollout in Canada got off to a slow start but is now picking up The rate of coronavirus infections in Canada's biggest province has reached an all-time high as hospitals warn they are close to being overwhelmed. A panel of experts say infections in Ontario could increase by 600% by June if public health measures are weak and vaccination rates do not pick up. Last week, for the first time since the pandemic began,Canada registered more cases per million than the US.,external About 22% of Canadians have now received a first vaccine dose. That compares to37% in the US,external. Ontario is now introducing strict new public measures, including: a six-week stay-at-home order restrictions on non-essential travel, including checkpoints at the borders with the neighbouring provinces of Quebec and Manitoba new powers for police to stop and question people who leave home a halt to non-essential construction Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau said the federal government would help Toronto, the largest city in the country, which has been hard-hit by the latest surge. ""We're going to do whatever it takes to help. Discussions are ongoing about extra healthcare providers, and we are ready to step up,"" he said on Friday. Covid infections in Canada edge closer to US rate Why Canada is falling behind in Covid vaccinations New variants - especially the UK variant, B1.1.7 - account for more than two-thirds of infections in Ontario. Even with vaccinations progressing, the expert panel warned that the number of new cases in Ontario could go as high as 30,000 a day - in a province with 14 million people, 38% of the total population of Canada. On Friday, Ontario reported 4,812 new cases, its third straight day of setting new records since the pandemic began. Hospital admissions and the number of patients in intensive care also set records for Ontario: 1,955 and 701, respectively. New restrictions on retail have been imposed in Ontario The expert panel said the best-case scenario would bring new cases down to about 5,000 a day, but only with considerably more stringent public health measures than the ones now in place. It would also require a vaccination rate of 300,000 a day - three times the current pace. Last week the College of Physicians and Surgeons of Ontario warned doctors that they might have to start making decisions about who to admit to intensive care, because units were stretched almost to capacity. The co-chairman of Ontario's expert panel, Adalsteinn Brown, said Ontario's hospitals could no longer function normally. ""Our children's hospitals are admitting adults. This has never happened in Ontario before. It's never happened in Canada before."" A field hospital is now being set up in the car park of one of Toronto's main hospitals. After a slow start, the pace of vaccination is now picking up. Canada was quick to buy up stocks of vaccine doses, but until recently the rollout was lagging behind other industrialised countries. Nine million Canadians have now received at least one vaccine dose. There was mixed news on Friday. Moderna said it would cut its next shipment to Canada by almost half, to 650,000 doses, but Pfizer is to supply an additional eight million doses after it reached a new deal with the Canadian government. Unlike some European countries, Canada has not withdrawn the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, but is advising its use only in patients over 55 while the risk from blood clots is assessed. Canadian health officials say the risk from catching Covid-19 far outweighs the risk of rare blood clots. The Canadian Medical Association (CMA) has called for a national response, sharing resources across provincial and territorial boundaries to deliver to the areas most in need.

Read more in our story here The Visual and Data Journalism Team More than 860 million doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered in 165 countries worldwide. However, there are vast differences in the pace of progress in different parts of the world. With an aim to give doses to nearly every adult around the world, this is the largest vaccination programme in history. The US and China have administered the highest number of doses, 198 million and 183 million respectively. India ranks third, with more than 117 million. But while nearly all of Europe and the Americas have begun vaccination campaigns,some countries in Africa are still to get started. The first vaccine to be approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) was produced by Pfizer and BioNTech, and was then followed by several others. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is now the most widely used around the globe. As we've been hearing, 77 cases of a new variant first identified in India have been discovered in the UK. Officials have called it a ""variant under investigation"" but Danny Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College, says it is likely to be escalated to a ""variant of concern"". ""I think we should be terribly concerned about it,"" he tells BBC Radio 4's PM programme. ""It is similar to the ones we know about - it mixes and matches some of the features we've seen before with this E484 change that we've seen before in a similar but different version in South Africa and Brazil, and then the infectivity change that we saw in the Californian variant.""

The pair, who live alone, decided to form asupport bubbleso they could dance together - and used Sandwell Valley car park to practise their moves. Sue says many passers-by had offered their support, some mimicking Strictly Come Dancing by giving them a score for their routine. But Geoff jokes there's been a financial downside to using the car park for their sessions. ""I've got about 25 [parking] tickets in the window of my car,"" he says. More than 500,000 people have had the AstraZeneca jab so far in Kenya Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta has ordered all teachers to have a Covid-19 vaccine irrespective of their age. The country has been vaccinating school managers and those aged above 50, elderly citizens and front-line workers.

Dr Mary Ross-Davie, director for professional midwifery and Covid vaccine lead at the Royal College of Midwives, says the move is a ""welcome"" and ""sensible step"". ""It empowers pregnant women to make their own decisions about whether or not to receive the vaccine,"" she says. ""Ultimately it will be a womanâs choice and midwives and obstetricians will be there to support them to make an informed decision that is right for them."" Up until now, the advice for women has been to discuss having a vaccine with their GP if their risk of exposure to the virus is high or if they have underlying health conditions which put them at higher risk of Covid complications.

The image shows 85-year-old Brazilian woman Rosa getting her first embrace from nurse Adriana through a transparent hug curtain. The photographer Mads Nissen toldBBC World Newsthat he was covering the Covid crisis in Brazil which has been one of the countries most affected by the crisis. âI was photographing the graveyards, the cemeteries where people were mourning, hospitals, the ambulances, but I also felt there was need for a different kind of picture,â he said. He wanted a picture which could show âthis certain Latin American spirit to fight and find love even in the most dark hour"". Brazil has thesecond highest death tollin the world from Covid-19. People who are pregnant should be offered a Covid vaccine at the same time as the rest of the population based on their age and clinical risk group, new official advice says. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) says there are ""no specific safety concerns"" identified with ""any brand of Covid-19 vaccines"" in relation to pregnancy. The JCVI said data from the US showed around 90,000 pregnant women had received jabs, mainly the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, ""without any safety concerns being raised"". It therefore advises that it is ""preferable"" for pregnant women in the UK to be offered these two vaccines where available, adding: ""There is no evidence to suggest that other vaccines are unsafe for pregnant women, but more research is needed."" We'll bring you more details as we get them. One in six UK adults are now fully vaccinated against Covid, with more than two million second doses given in the past week,according to the latest figures,external. As we reported a little earlier, more than 8.9 million people have now received both doses - the equivalent of 17.0% of the adult population. Breaking that down by nation, Wales is estimated to have given two doses to nearly a quarter of adults at 22.8%. In Northern Ireland it stands at 17.2%, in England it's 16.8% and in Scotland it's 15.5%. The figures are for vaccinations reported by the UK's health agencies up to 15 April. A hearse with a placard that reads: ""Sorry, but they won't let us bury your loved ones"" Funeral workers in Italy's capital city, Rome, are protesting over a build-up of bodies at cemeteries amid a backlog of burials and cremations following a surge in coronavirus deaths. More than 2,000 bodies are being stored at Rome's main crematorium, which can carry out about 50 cremations a day, while other cemeteries in the city are also full, Reuters news agency reports. ""Every few days we are told the cemeteries are blocked and
they haven't got any more room to take in the dead,"" head of Italy's federation of funeral
workers, Giovanni Caciolli, says. Workers have placed wreaths on display in hearse vehicles that read: ""Sorry, but they won't let us bury your loved ones."" The city's authorities responsible for handling burials and cremations, AMA, said in a statement this week it was facing an unprecedented situation and was working to create 60,000 new burial plots for the city. Italy has reported more than 3.8 million cases of coronavirus since the start of the pandemic, and over 116,000 Covid-related deaths. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Viruses mutate all the time in a bid to survive. The
challenge for scientists is to work out which mutations change how the
coronavirus behaves. Do they alter how the virus spreads, for example, do they
cause people to be more seriously ill and could they evade the protection of
vaccines? These are all questions experts will now try to answer about
the Indian variant by carrying out experiments in the lab and looking at data
on cases in the real world. So far, we know that it has two mutations â the first, E484Q
is similar to one found in the Brazilian, South African and Kent variants â and
the second, L452R has been found in a variant in California. That means it could be a concern based onwhat is known about those variants already. But the ""double mutation"" on its own isnât unusual and has
been found in other variants. Covid vaccines are still very effective at reducing the risk
of serious illness and manufacturers plan to update their vaccines in response
to the most worrying new variants. A further 34 people have died in the UK within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus, according tothe latest government figures,external. Another 2,596 people have tested positive for the disease. Meanwhile, 8,931,547 people have received their second dose of the vaccine and 32,574,221 have had their first.

Undertakers from Rome protest with placards reading: ""Excuse us, but they do not allow us to bury your loved ones""  As we've heard, 77 cases of a new variant first identified in India have been found in the UK. Reacting to the news, Labour's shadow home secretary Nick
Thomas-Symonds is calling for a ""proper hotel quarantine system in place urgently"". âMinisters
have been warned time and again that failing to introduce a comprehensive hotel
quarantine policy would leave us exposed to variants of Covid,"" he says. ""The blame for
these dangerous new variants reaching this country rests squarely with the UK government, and lives are being put at risk."" Public Health England has designated the B.1.617 variant as a ""variant under investigation"" and said there was currently no evidence to suggest it caused more severe disease or that vaccines were less likely to work against it.

Surge testing has also been taking place in six London boroughs this week A ""small number of cases"" of the South Africa Covid-19 variant have been found, Birmingham City Council says. One case was within the Ladywood and Soho & Jewellery Quarter wards and surge testing will be carried out. Residents aged over 16 who live or work there arestrongly encouraged to take part in door-to-door testing when offered,external, even if they are not showing symptoms, the authority says. This week surge testing for the South African variant has taken place in certain postcodes in Smethwick in the West Midlands, as well as in six London boroughs. Read more in our story here The Visual and Data Journalism Team More than 860 million doses of coronavirus vaccines have been administered in 165 countries worldwide. However, there are vast differences in the pace of progress in different parts of the world. With an aim to give doses to nearly every adult around the world, this is the largest vaccination programme in history. The US and China have administered the highest number of doses, 198 million and 183 million respectively. India ranks third, with more than 117 million. But while nearly all of Europe and the Americas have begun vaccination campaigns,some countries in Africa are still to get started. The first vaccine to be approved by the World Health Organization (WHO) was produced by Pfizer and BioNTech, and was then followed by several others. The Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine is now the most widely used around the globe. As we've been hearing, 77 cases of a new variant first identified in India have been discovered in the UK. Officials have called it a ""variant under investigation"" but Danny Altmann, professor of immunology at Imperial College, says it is likely to be escalated to a ""variant of concern"". ""I think we should be terribly concerned about it,"" he tells BBC Radio 4's PM programme. ""It is similar to the ones we know about - it mixes and matches some of the features we've seen before with this E484 change that we've seen before in a similar but different version in South Africa and Brazil, and then the infectivity change that we saw in the Californian variant."" He says all of the variants are ""a worry"" as ""they are things that can most scupper our escape plan at the moment and give us a third wave"".

The pair, who live alone, decided to form asupport bubbleso they could dance together - and used Sandwell Valley car park to practise their moves. Sue says many passers-by had offered their support, some mimicking Strictly Come Dancing by giving them a score for their routine. But Geoff jokes there's been a financial downside to using the car park for their sessions. ""I've got about 25 [parking] tickets in the window of my car,"" he says. More than 500,000 people have had the AstraZeneca jab so far in Kenya Kenya's President Uhuru Kenyatta has ordered all teachers to have a Covid-19 vaccine irrespective of their age. The country has been vaccinating school managers and those aged above 50, elderly citizens and front-line workers. More than 500,000 people have had the AstraZeneca jab out of the more than one million doses delivered to the country. All teachers and non-teaching staff in schools should have the jab before schools reopen on 10 May, the president says. According to the head of Kenya's Teachers Service Commission, Nancy Macharia, 15 primary teachers, three deputy headteachers and eight headteachers have died of Covid-19 during the pandemic. Ann Buchanan and her grandson Jensen were reunited in St Andrews In Scotland more families and friends have been able to reunite today at parks, gardens and beaches, after months in lockdown. Restrictions have been eased allowing people to travel between council areas and meet up to six people outdoors. St Andrews' famous West Sands beach was one popular spot for family reunions. Ann Buchanan, who lives near Stirling, met up with relatives, whom she had not seen since last year, at St Andrews' West Sands beach. ""We have not been able to meet up for ages, for such a long time, and it is really nice to get together here, she says. ""This is the furthest I have driven in a year. It's just like passing your driving test again."" Andrew McVie, 27, from Glasgow, says he is ""super excited"" to be visiting Millport, on the Isle of Cumbrae, to cycle round the island for the first time in more than two years. ""I've missed it so much not being able to go because of the travel restrictions but I'll still be taking precautions,"" he says.

Those attending will only evidence of a recent negative test. Guidance published on Friday says ""there will be no requirement for participants to show proof of vaccine"" at events in April and May including the FA Cup semi final and final at Wembley Stadium. There had been speculation that proof of vaccination would be required for the pilot events after the government said two weeks ago that it was developing a certification system involving vaccination, a recent negative test, or natural immunity.

The announcement, from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, brings the UK in line with other countries. Dr Mary Ross-Davie, director for professional midwifery and Covid vaccine lead at the Royal College of Midwives, says the move is a ""welcome"" and ""sensible step"". ""It empowers pregnant women to make their own decisions about whether or not to receive the vaccine,"" she says. ""Ultimately it will be a womanâs choice and midwives and obstetricians will be there to support them to make an informed decision that is right for them."" Up until now, the advice for women has been to discuss having a vaccine with their GP if their risk of exposure to the virus is high or if they have underlying health conditions which put them at higher risk of Covid complications.

The image shows 85-year-old Brazilian woman Rosa getting her first embrace from nurse Adriana through a transparent hug curtain. The photographer Mads Nissen toldBBC World Newsthat he was covering the Covid crisis in Brazil which has been one of the countries most affected by the crisis. âI was photographing the graveyards, the cemeteries where people were mourning, hospitals, the ambulances, but I also felt there was need for a different kind of picture,â he said. He wanted a picture which could show âthis certain Latin American spirit to fight and find love even in the most dark hour"". Brazil has thesecond highest death tollin the world from Covid-19. People who are pregnant should be offered a Covid vaccine at the same time as the rest of the population based on their age and clinical risk group, new official advice says. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) says there are ""no specific safety concerns"" identified with ""any brand of Covid-19 vaccines"" in relation to pregnancy. The JCVI said data from the US showed around 90,000 pregnant women had received jabs, mainly the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, ""without any safety concerns being raised"". It therefore advises that it is ""preferable"" for pregnant women in the UK to be offered these two vaccines where available, adding: ""There is no evidence to suggest that other vaccines are unsafe for pregnant women, but more research is needed."" We'll bring you more details as we get them. One in six UK adults are now fully vaccinated against Covid, with more than two million second doses given in the past week,according to the latest figures,external. As we reported a little earlier, more than 8.9 million people have now received both doses - the equivalent of 17.0% of the adult population. Breaking that down by nation, Wales is estimated to have given two doses to nearly a quarter of adults at 22.8%. In Northern Ireland it stands at 17.2%, in England it's 16.8% and in Scotland it's 15.5%. The figures are for vaccinations reported by the UK's health agencies up to 15 April. A hearse with a placard that reads: ""Sorry, but they won't let us bury your loved ones"" Funeral workers in Italy's capital city, Rome, are protesting over a build-up of bodies at cemeteries amid a backlog of burials and cremations following a surge in coronavirus deaths. More than 2,000 bodies are being stored at Rome's main crematorium, which can carry out about 50 cremations a day, while other cemeteries in the city are also full, Reuters news agency reports. ""Every few days we are told the cemeteries are blocked and
they haven't got any more room to take in the dead,"" head of Italy's federation of funeral
workers, Giovanni Caciolli, says. Workers have placed wreaths on display in hearse vehicles that read: ""Sorry, but they won't let us bury your loved ones."" The city's authorities responsible for handling burials and cremations, AMA, said in a statement this week it was facing an unprecedented situation and was working to create 60,000 new burial plots for the city. Italy has reported more than 3.8 million cases of coronavirus since the start of the pandemic, and over 116,000 Covid-related deaths. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Viruses mutate all the time in a bid to survive. The
challenge for scientists is to work out which mutations change how the
coronavirus behaves. Do they alter how the virus spreads, for example, do they
cause people to be more seriously ill and could they evade the protection of
vaccines? These are all questions experts will now try to answer about
the Indian variant by carrying out experiments in the lab and looking at data
on cases in the real world. So far, we know that it has two mutations â the first, E484Q
is similar to one found in the Brazilian, South African and Kent variants â and
the second, L452R has been found in a variant in California. That means it could be a concern based onwhat is known about those variants already. But the ""double mutation"" on its own isnât unusual and has
been found in other variants. Covid vaccines are still very effective at reducing the risk
of serious illness and manufacturers plan to update their vaccines in response
to the most worrying new variants. A further 34 people have died in the UK within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus, according tothe latest government figures,external. Another 2,596 people have tested positive for the disease. Meanwhile, 8,931,547 people have received their second dose of the vaccine and 32,574,221 have had their first.

Hancock owns shares in NHS-approved firm,"The government denied there was any conflict of interest and said the health secretary had declared his shareholding properly Health Secretary Matt Hancock owns shares in a company which was approved as a potential supplier for NHS trusts in England, it has emerged. In March, he declared he had acquired more than 15% of Topwood Ltd, which was granted the approved status in 2019. The firm, which specialises in the secure storage, shredding and scanning of documents, also won Â£300,000 of business from NHS Wales this year. A government spokesman said there had been no conflict of interest. He also said the health secretary had acted ""entirely properly"". But Labour said there was ""cronyism at the heart of this government"" and the party's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has asked the head of the civil service to investigate whether Mr Hancock breached the ministerial code. Hancock 'had drink' with Cameron and Greensill Covid spending: MPs' contacts were given priority Hancock acted unlawfully over Covid contracts In March this year, Mr Hancock declared in the MPs' register of interests that he hadacquired more than 15% of the shares,externalin Topwood, under a ""delegated management arrangement"". Public contract records show that the company was awarded a place in the Shared Business Services framework as a potential supplier for NHS local trusts in 2019, the year after Mr Hancock became health secretary. The MPs' register did not mention that his sister Emily Gilruth - involved in the firm since its foundation in 2002 - owns a larger portion of the shares and is a director, or that Topwood has links to the NHS - as first reported by theGuido Fawkes blog,externalandHealth Service Journal,external. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""Matt Hancock has to answer the questions... He can't pretend that the responsibility lies elsewhere."" But he said he was ""not suggesting"" the health secretary had broken any rules. The SNP's deputy Westminster leader, Kirsten Oswald, said ""Tory cronyism"" was ""rife within Westminster"". But a government spokesperson said: ""Mr Hancock has acted entirely properly in these circumstances. All declarations of interest have been made in accordance with the ministerial code. Ministers have no involvement in the awarding of these contracts, and no conflict of interest arises."" A Department of Health source said Mr Hancock had discussed the fact he was to be gifted shares in the firm with civil servants before he accepted them. They ruled that if any conflicts of interest were to arise, they could be handled in line withthe ministerial code,,externalthe rulebook setting out the standards of conduct for ministers. This states that ministers should declare interests of close family if they believe they might give rise to a conflict. When he was secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport in 2017, he did declare that his brother Chris Hancock was chief executive of an investment crowdfunding company called Crowd2Fund. The Department of Health said Mr Hancock had no active role in running Topwood. As health secretary for England, he does not have responsibility for NHS Wales, which awarded contracts to Topwood earlier this year. Mr Hancock has not yet commented.

"Shopping centre giant cuts rents in revival bidHammerson, whose centres include the Bullring and Brent Cross, is ""resetting rents to more affordable levels"".","Hammerson, owner of Birmingham's Bullring, is to cut rents for its retail tenants by 30% as it aims to recover from a year of lockdowns. The firm's UK boss Mark Bourgeois said it had been a ""challenging"" period when it had tried to ""share the pain"" with retailers forced to shut. Non-essential shops in England and Wales reopened on Monday. Hammerson said footfall had been stronger than the week after the first lockdown ended in June. Over the past year, Hammerson, which also owns London's Brent Cross, collected about 75% of rents owed by its tenants and agreed abatements with those shops who needed it. However, it expects to continue helping the retailers in its shopping centres which also include The Oracle site in Reading and the Victoria Quarter in Leeds. ""Typically, we're resetting our rents to more affordable levels,"" Mr Bourgeois told the BBC's Today programme. ""We reckon across the board and our business we'll probably reduce rents from their peak by about 30% so we are really doing our bit as are... all landlords to make sure we maintain vibrancy in these centres."" People returned to shops on Monday as non-essential retailers in England reopened Mr Bourgeois said that the bounce back in footfall in the past week had been more pronounced than equivalent period last June. He said that the Covid-19 vaccine roll-out has made shoppers ""feel safer"", adding it was likely there was ""more cash in people's pockets and they are feeling perhaps more confident to go and spend"". The Bank of England estimates that UK households have amassed Â£125bn in pent-up savings during the pandemic. But Mr Bourgeois also said: ""People just love to get out. You can only do so much online shopping [people want to] get out and feel the products and brands in real life."" Over its last financial year, for the 12 months to 31 December, Hammerson reported a record Â£1.7bn loss. However, even before the coronavirus pandemic forced the closure of large parts of the economy, retailers and their landlords were struggling as more consumers chose to shop online. Last June, Intu, the heavily-indebted owned of Manchester's Trafford Centre, was forced to file for administration. Mr Bourgeois said: ""Retail has always been about winners and losers and that's been really accelerated during Covid."" He said Hammerson was now working to ""repurpose"" space left by the likes of department store Debenhams, which closed all its high street stores after falling into administration and selling the brand to online fashion firm Boohoo. ""We have a planning application in Leicester for instance where we are preparing to demolish a Debenhams store and put 300 flats there,"" said Mr Bourgeois.

'NI can rebuild' as restrictions ease,"Shoppers will return to streets when all retailers in Northern Ireland can reopen at the end of April Northern Ireland can begin rebuilding its economy under plans to ease Covid-19 restrictions from next week, Economy Minister Diane Dodds has said. On Thursday the Stormont executive agreed reopening dates for some sectors, includinghairdressers, non-essential retail and hospitality. The current lockdown has been in place for more than 100 days in a bid to curb the spread of coronavirus. Mrs Dodds said precautions would still be needed to reopen businesses safely. ""But it does mean we can get on with opening our economy, recovering our economy,"" she told BBC News NI's The View programme. She said growing the economy would help to mitigate the fallout from the pandemic, including a potentially huge spike in unemployment. The announcement has received acautious welcome from businesses. What you need to know about NI's lockdown easing Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey told The View she was glad the executive had reached consensus. ""There was no dissent around the table - it [was] a good day to give hope to the public,"" she said. Peter McCleery, who runs a cafe in Comber, County Down, said that preparing to resume trade would be like opening a new business. The cafe has no outdoor space so it is due to open on 24 May, several weeks after hospitality businesses that have outdoor facilities. Shutters are set be lifted from the doors of pubs in Northern Ireland for the first time this year ""Even with those dates we have to plan ahead and recruit staff and train staff,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""We're starting again from a fresh sheet - we're looking forward to it."" The owner of a County Armagh hotel situated a short distance from the Irish border said he was concerned that business that would have to deal with the consequences of the differing restrictions in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Jason Foody said it was not the job of his hotel staff ""to police the roads and people that come through our door"". The Republic of Ireland hasrecently lifted the 5km (three miles) travel limitthat applied under its highest level of restrictions. Business owners have been busy preparing their premises for reopening Mr Foody said: ""Previously if we were seeing [people with] addresses... from areas that shouldn't have travelled we were saying it to them but people have to travel for different reasons too and if it's for essential reasons you can't stop them. He said the hotel was ""getting a huge amount of calls"" from people in the Republic of Ireland who were wanting to book a stay. Jules Stothard, who owns a pub in Dromara, County Down, said her business had been open for about three months over the past 13 months. She would be ""ecstatic"" to see her customers again but had a ""bit of anxiety about the financial side"". ""We are grateful to the government for the grant but every penny we have had has gone,"" she said. ""We were so ecstatic that we could open again but then reality strikes - we won't have the customers at the capacity to sustain our business without help."" Outdoor dining and drinking at cafes and bars will be allowed from 30 April Tourist attractions also face challenges when they reopen - the Marble Arch Caves in County Fermanagh will have reduced capacity for its tours, says its manager Kate McGrath. ""We will get there but need to clarify bubble numbers,"" she added. Proposed dates leaked to the media on Thursday had suggested outdoor hospitality for pubs would have to wait until 10 May before being allowed to welcome back customers, with indoor venues not reopening before 1 June. However, Mrs Dodds had raised concerns in a letter to the first and deputy first ministers about the proposed dates, saying it was her preference for unlicensed premises to open earlier, on 23 April, followed later by licenced premises.

Summer holidays 'can be saved',"This video can not be played Friedrich Joussen tells the BBC's Aaron Heslehurst that he is optimistic about the summer. Successful vaccine programmes will prevent another washout for summer holidaymakers, the boss of Europe's largest tour company has told the BBC. ""We are optimistic about the summer,"" said Friedrich Joussen, who runs TUI. The firm - which owns a fleet of aircraft, cruise ships and a chain of travel agencies - said bookings in March alone had hit 2.8 million. As a result, it expected to operate up to 75% of its normal schedule for the summer season. ""We are still confident that we will have a decent summer,"" said Mr Joussen, pointing to coronavirus vaccination programmes in the UK, US and Europe. What are the rules for UK and foreign holidays? The company, which sells holidays to 180 different countries, suffered heavy losses during the pandemic. Across the industry, income slumped by almost $4.5 trillion last year, leaving more than 62 million people without work, according to the World Travel and Tourism Council (WTTC). The industry body is pressing for international travel to resume in June to stem further job losses. But Mr Joussen said he expected some countries to ask travellers to prove they had been vaccinated before they were allowed to cross the border. Although he thinks demonstrating a negative test result would be just as effective in preventing the spread of the virus. However, for that strategy to be successful, he said the cost of those tests should be reduced. ""The cheaper it gets, the better it works and the less harmful it is for the general economy,"" he said. European countries have ramped up their vaccination programmes in recent weeks, as the continent experiences a third wave of infections in the face of new variants. Nevertheless, Mr Joussen is optimistic about the summer. ""All medical advice we are getting as a company says that existing vaccines are working with existing variants,"" Mr Joussen said. ""Now they might be less efficient sometimes, but still it's much better than not being vaccinated."" In the past year, TUI has been forced to borrow billions from the German government just to stay afloat. But analysts have warned that in the wake of the crisis, the part-nationalised firm may struggle to compete against leaner rivals, as the industry reels from more than 12 months of international travel bans. Mr Joussen said the German state stepped in at a time of great uncertainty, when the firm was struggling to survive and could not raise money from private investors. ""Berlin is a very rational investor,"" he said, adding: ""Germany would want to exit the loan as soon as possible.""

Passer-by ran into burning building to save womanSam Merrill says he's no hero after running into the blazing flat to save the woman trapped inside.Sheffield & South Yorkshire,"Firefighters were called to the flat blaze on Morland Road at about 19:00 BST on Thursday A glazier who ran into a burning building to rescue a woman trapped inside said he was just ""going on instincts"". Sam Merrill, 32, had finished a gym session on Morland Road, Sheffield, at 19:00 BST on Thursday when he noticed smoke from a nearby block of flats. He rushed in to the building and found the stricken woman in a first-floor flat. Mr Merrill denied he was a hero, adding: ""You don't do it for that."" More stories from across Yorkshire Sam Merrill said he did not think of himself as a hero Firefighters were called to the blaze but Mr Merrill had already entered the building to carry out the rescue. ""By the time she'd got outside, she was on the verge of being dead. If it was another 30 seconds there'd have been no return,"" he said. ""There were flames around the door. Everyone was covered in smoke and it was spreading fast. ""It was just a case of making sure everyone is out and everyone is safe, that was the scenario for me,"" Mr Merrill added. A cordon was in place while an investigation took place The keen boxer said he did not think of himself as a hero. He added: ""You don't do it for that status, you just do it because you don't want someone to die. Just the fact the woman's all right is better for me.""

Shopping centre giant cuts rents in revival bid,"Hammerson, owner of Birmingham's Bullring, is to cut rents for its retail tenants by 30% as it aims to recover from a year of lockdowns. The firm's UK boss Mark Bourgeois said it had been a ""challenging"" period when it had tried to ""share the pain"" with retailers forced to shut. Non-essential shops in England and Wales reopened on Monday. Hammerson said footfall had been stronger than the week after the first lockdown ended in June. Over the past year, Hammerson, which also owns London's Brent Cross, collected about 75% of rents owed by its tenants and agreed abatements with those shops who needed it. However, it expects to continue helping the retailers in its shopping centres which also include The Oracle site in Reading and the Victoria Quarter in Leeds. ""Typically, we're resetting our rents to more affordable levels,"" Mr Bourgeois told the BBC's Today programme. ""We reckon across the board and our business we'll probably reduce rents from their peak by about 30% so we are really doing our bit as are... all landlords to make sure we maintain vibrancy in these centres."" People returned to shops on Monday as non-essential retailers in England reopened Mr Bourgeois said that the bounce back in footfall in the past week had been more pronounced than equivalent period last June. He said that the Covid-19 vaccine roll-out has made shoppers ""feel safer"", adding it was likely there was ""more cash in people's pockets and they are feeling perhaps more confident to go and spend"". The Bank of England estimates that UK households have amassed Â£125bn in pent-up savings during the pandemic. But Mr Bourgeois also said: ""People just love to get out. You can only do so much online shopping [people want to] get out and feel the products and brands in real life."" Over its last financial year, for the 12 months to 31 December, Hammerson reported a record Â£1.7bn loss. However, even before the coronavirus pandemic forced the closure of large parts of the economy, retailers and their landlords were struggling as more consumers chose to shop online. Last June, Intu, the heavily-indebted owned of Manchester's Trafford Centre, was forced to file for administration. Mr Bourgeois said: ""Retail has always been about winners and losers and that's been really accelerated during Covid."" He said Hammerson was now working to ""repurpose"" space left by the likes of department store Debenhams, which closed all its high street stores after falling into administration and selling the brand to online fashion firm Boohoo. ""We have a planning application in Leicester for instance where we are preparing to demolish a Debenhams store and put 300 flats there,"" said Mr Bourgeois. ""So we're bringing homes right into the heart of the city.""

Ex-Civil Service boss 'baffled' by Greensill links,"A former head of the Civil Service has said he is ""baffled"" that approval was given for a top civil servant to take a job at Greensill Capital while still on the government payroll. Lord Kerslake said he could ""see no circumstances"" under which Bill Crothers's appointment at the finance firm could have been ""acceptable"". The government has ordered a review which will look into his role. Labour said the dual working was evidence of a ""return to sleaze"". What jobs can ex-ministers do and what are the rules? Civil servants ordered to declare second jobs Top civil servant 'joined Greensill before quitting' What's the Greensill lobbying row about? Lord Kerslake, who ran the Civil Service under David Cameron's government and has advised the Labour Party, is the latest high-profile figure to express concern about the relationship between political figures and the now collapsed finance firm. Greensill is at the heart of a row engulfing Westminster about access, influence and lobbying, after it emerged that Mr Cameron had contacted current cabinet ministers about loans on behalf of the company, while working as a consultant there after leaving office. A government review and three separate inquiries by parliamentary committees will look at the former prime minister's role and that of Mr Crothers. The National Audit Office, which monitors public spending, has also launched an investigation in to Greensill's involvement in the government's Covid-19 financial support schemes. It says this will include the accreditation process and any subsequent monitoring of the company's activities. Bill Crothers was in charge of government procurement until 2015 Mr Crothers had stopped being head of government procurement by the time he started work as an adviser for Greensill in 2015, but remained a senior civil servant. Lord Kerslake, an independent peer, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that trust in the Civil Service was ""its most precious commodity"". He said he was ""shocked and concerned"" at recent revelations, and that ""legitimate concerns"" about how Mr Crothers - who was able to hold dual roles - needed to be ""thoroughly investigated"". ""He led on procurement, an area of absolutely intense scrutiny and where integrity is vital,"" he said, while ""the effect of what he did, if not the intent"" was to ""bypass"" the rules set out by the watchdog, Acoba, that advises ministers and officials on outside employment. ""The situation was that Greensill were active in government, even if they didn't have a contract. So I am personally baffled as to how this got approved,"" he added. Mr Crothers's appointment by joined Greensill received the go-ahead from the Cabinet Office, but he did not consult Acoba. It emerged on Thursday that he had alsofailed to alert it about another jobhe took in 2016 as a trustee with the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply. Mr Crothers apologised in a letter to Acoba for what he described an ""honest mistake"", saying he did not think he had to report the role as it was unpaid and with a not-for-profit charity. But the head of Acoba, Lord Pickles, said the rules applied to both paid and unpaid jobs and it was therefore a breach of the regulations. The Guardian newspaper has reported further links between Greensill and the Civil Service. It said David Brierwood combined a role as a Crown representative in the Cabinet Office with being a director at Greensill for three-and-a-half years. Mr Brierwood has not commented on the revelations. But a Cabinet Office spokesman said: ""Crown representatives do not participate in the procurement process nor are they able to award any contracts. ""They are part-time senior executives recruited for their working knowledge of a sector to help ensure value for money for the taxpayer. ""All Crown representatives go through regular propriety checks and cannot work with a supplier where there could be a conflict of interest. ""Mr Brierwood's Crown representative role was not anything to do with supply-chain finance."" Speaking on a visit to Edinburgh, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer repeated his calls for a ""full, independent, transparent inquiry"". ""This has gone much wider than a single incident,"" he added, with ""story after story"" of cronyism and ""contracts for mates"". ""It is a catalogue of examples of sleaze and we have got to get to the bottom of it."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the ""most important thing is to get to the bottom of it properly"" and that all ministers and officials have been ordered to tell the government inquiry what it needs to know.

Student's heart failure linked to energy drinks,"A 21-year old university student developed heart failure after ""excessive"" consumption of energy drinks, a new report suggests. For two years, the man drank four 500ml energy drinks a day, according to the BMJ Case Report. He spent 58 days in hospital, including the intensive care unit which he described as ""traumatising"". Before the hospital admission, he suffered with shortness of breath and weight loss for four months. Doctors treating him considered a number of diagnoses, but concluded: ""Energy drink-induced cardiotoxicity was felt to be the most likely cause."" An organ transplant was considered after tests revealed both his heart and kidneys had failed - with the kidney failure linked to a long-standing but previously undiagnosed condition. The unnamed patient contributed to the report, and was unable to continue his university studies three months before hospital admission because of his health. ""When I was drinking up to four energy drinks per day, I suffered from tremors and heart palpitations, which interfered with my ability to concentrate on daily tasks and my studies at university."" The authors said recovery or relapse was difficult to predict After nine months his heart function has appeared to have returned with ""mildly impaired function"", but the report said it was difficult to predict recovery or potential for relapse. The student suffered from severe migraine headaches which would ""often occur during the periods"" when he didn't have energy drinks. ""This also restricted my ability to perform day-to-day tasks and even leisurely activities such as going to the park or taking a walk,"" he said. He felt there should be more awareness about energy drinks and the effect of their contents. ""I believe they are very addictive and far too accessible to young children. I think warning labels, similar to smoking, should be made to illustrate the potential dangers of the ingredients in energy drink,"" he added. Energy drinks ban for children proposed Fizzy drinks: What we know and what we don't This comes after a separate study done by researchers at Cardiff University analysed the responses of a health survey of more than 176,000 secondary school children in Wales aged 11 to 16 between 2013 and 2017. It found that 6% of pupils said they drank energy drinks on a ""daily"" basis - a trend which didn't change over time. The study's lead author Dr Kelly Morgan said there was a difference in consumption between those from low and high socioeconomic groups. ""Marketing campaigns for energy drinks are often aimed at those from more disadvantaged backgrounds."" Their popularity was unlikely to be hit unless policy measures were ""put in place"", Dr Morgan added. Follow Newsbeat onInstagram,external,Facebook,external,Twitter,externalandYouTube,external.

Ocado gets into self-driving delivery tech,"Online grocery retailer Ocado has unveiled a major push into autonomous driving technology. It has teamed up with another British company, Oxbotica, to build self-driving vehicles for itself and others who use its platform. That could include automatic forklift trucks at warehouses, self-driving delivery vans, or even ""kerb to kitchen"" robots for the final leg. As part of the deal, Ocado has bought a Â£10m stake in Oxbotica. Together, they say they plan to build hardware and software for autonomous vehicles. ""We want the entire end to end operation, ultimately, to be autonomous - from the receipt of stock to the warehouse all the way through to the customer's door,"" said Alex Harvey, Ocado's head of advanced technology. ""From a customer's perspective you open your door and outside you will see an autonomous van or another autonomous vehicle pull up outside your house, and most likely an autonomous robot will get out of that autonomous vehicle, will collect your groceries, and hand them to you at the doorstep."" In recent years, Ocado has tried to project itself as a technology platform to be used by global retailers, rather than just an online grocery store. It has developed robots which now pick and pack groceries at its state-of-the-art fulfilment centres, and this week,America's Kroger supermarket chain,externalunveiled its first warehouse using the Ocado technology. Grocery shopping has changed for good, says Ocado Self-driving car tests begin on Oxford's roads Kroger's delivery vans also use software developed by Ocado to plot the most efficient routes. The new partnership with Oxbotica will aim to take this idea further. Oxbotica builds autonomous driving software for a range of global clients.The company was founded in 2014 by two Oxford professors- Paul Newman and Ingmar Posner - whose university research focused on self-driving cars. The startup company has just raised new funding from investors in the UK, US and China. Ocado's Â£10m stake is part of that funding round, and will give it a seat on Oxbotica's board. This video can not be played WATCH: In 2017, Ocado tested Oxbotica's tech for driverless deliveries in London In its announcement, Ocado tempered expectations and said that getting permission from regulators to operate autonomous vehicles on public roads - allowing driverless deliveries to customers' homes - may take some time. But it said that ""last-mile"" deliveries to customers' homes are a significant part of an online retailer's costs, with labour accounting for half of that - so autonomous vans could produce big savings. In the short term, it sees vehicles operating in restricted areas such as its own warehouses, with the first prototypes coming within two years. Ocado executives hate it when you call it an online grocer. The company wants to be seen as a technology platform for the world's retailers. This partnership with another British business, the scrappy autonomous software startup Oxbotica, is meant to signal the scale of its ambitions. For Oxbotica's Paul Newman, it's an exciting opportunity for two UK companies to become a global force in technology which has been dominated by American and Chinese players - ""we've got a global vision, we're going to change the way goods are moved,"" he told me this morning. And Ocado's technology boss Alex Harvey points out that the company has already acquired two American tech businesses this year. ""It's normally the other way around... I think it represents a very exciting opportunity to be able to leverage the best of British between Oxbotica and Ocado and export it to the rest of the world."" Remember - big dreams about the progress towards self-driving vehicles on public roads have come up against the reality that the technological and regulatory hurdles to be cleared are very challenging, Everyone from the former Chancellor Philip Hammond to Oxbotica's own Paul Newman predicted self-driving cars and vans should be on UK streets by now. Prof Newman, who started his driverless car research as an Oxford University academic, admits that was a little optimistic. But he says now, the time is right: ""This is a sensible proposition that makes economic sense."" But sceptics will wonder how motorists will feel about sharing the roads with driverless vans, let alone what customers will think about a robot telling you that the avocados are out of stock and you're getting oranges instead. Oxford's robots and the funding of innovation Grocery shopping has changed for good, says Ocado Robots to take on more supermarket tasks Shopping may never be the same again, says M&S Self-driving car tests begin on Oxford's roads Uber sells self-driving cars to focus on profits Comments can not be loaded To load Comments you need to enable JavaScript in your browser Deadly wildfires rage across LA as fierce winds threaten more destruction Warning on gas prices as cold snap hits supplies UK records coldest night of winter as freeze to last into weekend 'I paid fake doctor thousands for fillers - now I look like a gargoyle' The Papers: 'Lost Angeles' and 'Musk seeks plan to oust Starmer' Pop star Chappell Roan wins BBC Sound Of 2025 Weekly quiz: Zendaya looked happy but who else sparkled at the Golden Globes?

What is China's 'patriot' plan for Hong Kong?,"Hong Kong's flag, flying in line with China's banner In its latest move to tighten control over Hong Kong, China is pushing for a controversial ""patriot"" plan to reform the city's elections. Beijing says the goal is to keep ""unpatriotic"" figures from positions of political power in Hong Kong. But critics warn it would mean the end of democracy in Hong Kong, eradicating whatever opposition there is left. Hong Kong used to be under British control, but was handed back to China in 1997 under a ""one country, two systems"" principle. This was meant to protect certain freedoms for Hong Kong, which no other part of mainland China has: freedom of assembly and speech, an independent judiciary, and some democratic rights. These freedoms are enshrined in Hong Kong's mini-constitution, the Basic Law, which was meant to last until 2047. On 11 March,the ""patriots governing Hong Kong"" resolution was passedat the National People's Congress (NPC), paving the way for Beijing to amend annexes of the Basic Law. On 30 March, the resolution passed the NPC's Standing Committee and could be enacted in Hong Kong within weeks. How is Hong Kong run? China's parliament remakes Hong Kong in its own image Candidates for Hong Kong's parliament, the Legislative Council (LegCo) are to be nominated by the Election Committee, a powerful body which until now only elected the city's most senior official, the Chief Executive. This Election Committee, which is heavily pro-Beijing, will be expanded by 300 members from 1,200 to 1,500. Any prospective MP, member of the Election Committee or candidate for Chief Executive will be vetted by a separate screening committee, making it easy to bar anyone deemed as being critical of Beijing. There will also be changes to LegCo itself, diluting the influence of directly elected MPs. While overall seats will increase from 70 to 90, the number of directly elected representatives will fall from 35 to 20. Forty seats will go to MPs chosen by the Election Committee while 30 will be given to MPs elected by special interests such as business, banking and trade, which historically are also pro-Beijing. The move appears to be a continuation of China's plan to tighten control over Hong Kong, following recent developments. Huge pro-democracy protests took place in 2019, some of which turned violent. Later that year, pro-democracy groups made huge gains in local district council elections. Since then, Beijing has passeda controversial national security law,which effectively reduces Hong Kong's autonomy and made it easier to punish demonstrators. Dozens of people have since been arrested under this law. In 2019, clashes between police and protesters often turned violent In November 2020, several lawmakers were deemed threats to national security and dismissed - this led to the resignation of nearly all the city's pro-democracy lawmakers. The developments underscore the rapid expansion of Beijing's influence in the territory, pushing for loyalty from all levels of power. US condemns China 'assault on Hong Kong democracy' Hong Kong charges 47 in sweeping use of new law This video can not be played Hong Kong opposition members announce mass resignation Critics, including the UK government, allege that China is now effectively undermining the ""one country, two systems"" principle with all these changes. But Beijing says it is safeguarding its sovereignty, and rejects what it calls ""foreign interference"" in domestic affairs.

Hong Kong's rebel mogul,"Jimmy Lai was sentenced in April 2021 to a year in prison The billionaire media mogul Jimmy Lai, one of the most prominent supporters of Hong Kong's pro-democracy movement, is now on trial. Already imprisoned on fraud charges and for his involvement in protests in the territory, the 76-year-old is now accused of colluding with foreign forces. He has denied all the charges. The trial has drawn international attention, with British Foreign Secretary David Cameron calling for the release of Mr Lai, who is a UK citizen. Critics say his case shows how Hong Kong's legal system has become a weapon to silence political opposition. Mr Lai, who has been in jail for almost three years, now faces a potential life sentence. He has been a persistent thorn in China's side. Unlike other tycoons who rose to the top in Hong Kong, Mr Lai became one of the fiercest critics of the Chinese state and a leading figure advocating democracy in the former British territory. As a result, he has faced a string of charges and was eventually sentenced to a prison term in 2021 on a charge of ""unauthorised assembly"". Last December, he was handed a five-year sentence for fraud. He is still the most prominent person charged under Hong Kong's controversial national security law, which can carry a life sentence. ""Iâm a born rebel,"" he told the BBC in an interview in 2020, hours before he was charged. ""I have a very rebellious character."" Jimmy Lai was born in Guangzhou, a city in southern China, to a wealthy family that lost everything when the communists took power in 1949. He was 12 years old when he fled his village in mainland China, arriving in Hong Kong as a stowaway on a fishing boat. While working odd jobs and knitting in a small clothing shop he taught himself English. He went from a menial role to eventually founding a multi-million dollar empire including the international clothing brand Giordano. Hong Kong offers HK$1m bounties on five activists Hong Kong's universities shrivel in Beijing's grip Hong Kong is a place of fear, Agnes Chow tells BBC The chain was a huge success. But when China sent in tanks to crush pro-democracy protests in Beijingâs Tiananmen Square in 1989, Mr Lai began a new journey as a vocal democracy activist as well as an entrepreneur. He started writing columns criticising the massacre that followed the demonstrations in Beijing and established a publishing house that went on to become one of Hong Kong's most influential. This video can not be played The Hong Kong billionaire risking it all by speaking out As China responded by threatening to shut his stores on the mainland, leading him to sell the company, Mr Lai launched a string of popular pro-democracy titles that included Next, a digital magazine, and the widely read Apple Daily newspaper. In a local media landscape increasingly fearful of Beijing, Mr Lai had been a persistent critic of Chinese authorities both through his publications and writing. This has seen him become a hero for many in Hong Kong, who view him as a man of courage who took great risks to defend the freedoms of Hong Kong. But on the mainland he is viewed as a âtraitorâ who threatens Chinese national security. In recent years, masked attackers firebombed Mr Laiâs house and company headquarters. He was also the target of an assassination plot. But none of the threats stopped him from airing his views robustly. He was a prominent part of the cityâs pro-democracy demonstrations and was arrested twice in 2021 on illegal assembly charges. Jimmy Lai was detained by Hong Kong's newly set-up national security unit When China passed Hong Kong's new national security law in June 2020, Mr Lai told the BBC it sounded the ""death knell"" for the territory. The influential entrepreneur also warned that Hong Kong would become as corrupt as China. Without the rule of law, he said, its coveted status as a global financial hub would be ""totally destroyed"". The media mogul is known for his frankness and acts of flamboyance. In 2021, he urged US President Donald Trump to help the territory, saying he was ""the only one who can save us"" from China. His newspaper, Apple Daily, published a front-page letter that finished: ""Mr President, please help us."" For Mr Lai, such acts were necessary to defend the city which had taken him in and fuelled his success. He once told news agency AFP: ""I came here with nothing, the freedom of this place has given me everything... Maybe itâs time I paid back for that freedom by fighting for it.""

One in six UK adults are now fully vaccinated against Covid, with more than two million second doses given in the past week,according to the latest figures,external. As we reported a little earlier, more than 8.9 million people have now received both doses - the equivalent of 17.0% of the adult population. Breaking that down by nation, Wales is estimated to have given two doses to nearly a quarter of adults at 22.8%. In Northern Ireland it stands at 17.2%, in England it's 16.8% and in Scotland it's 15.5%. The figures are for vaccinations reported by the UK's health agencies up to 15 April. A hearse with a placard that reads: ""Sorry, but they won't let us bury your loved ones"" Funeral workers in Italy's capital city, Rome, are protesting over a build-up of bodies at cemeteries amid a backlog of burials and cremations following a surge in coronavirus deaths. More than 2,000 bodies are being stored at Rome's main crematorium, which can carry out about 50 cremations a day, while other cemeteries in the city are also full, Reuters news agency reports. ""Every few days we are told the cemeteries are blocked and
they haven't got any more room to take in the dead,"" head of Italy's federation of funeral
workers, Giovanni Caciolli, says. Workers have placed wreaths on display in hearse vehicles that read: ""Sorry, but they won't let us bury your loved ones."" The city's authorities responsible for handling burials and cremations, AMA, said in a statement this week it was facing an unprecedented situation and was working to create 60,000 new burial plots for the city. Italy has reported more than 3.8 million cases of coronavirus since the start of the pandemic, and over 116,000 Covid-related deaths. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Viruses mutate all the time in a bid to survive. The
challenge for scientists is to work out which mutations change how the
coronavirus behaves. Do they alter how the virus spreads, for example, do they
cause people to be more seriously ill and could they evade the protection of
vaccines? These are all questions experts will now try to answer about
the Indian variant by carrying out experiments in the lab and looking at data
on cases in the real world. So far, we know that it has two mutations â the first, E484Q
is similar to one found in the Brazilian, South African and Kent variants â and
the second, L452R has been found in a variant in California. That means it could be a concern based onwhat is known about those variants already. But the ""double mutation"" on its own isnât unusual and has
been found in other variants. Covid vaccines are still very effective at reducing the risk
of serious illness and manufacturers plan to update their vaccines in response
to the most worrying new variants. A further 34 people have died in the UK within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus, according tothe latest government figures,external. Another 2,596 people have tested positive for the disease. Meanwhile, 8,931,547 people have received their second dose of the vaccine and 32,574,221 have had their first.

More than 2,000 bodies are being stored at Rome's main crematorium, which can carry out about 50 cremations a day, while other cemeteries in the city are also full, Reuters news agency reports. ""Every few days we are told the cemeteries are blocked and
they haven't got any more room to take in the dead,"" head of Italy's federation of funeral
workers, Giovanni Caciolli, says. Workers have placed wreaths on display in hearse vehicles that read: ""Sorry, but they won't let us bury your loved ones."" The city's authorities responsible for handling burials and cremations, AMA, said in a statement this week it was facing an unprecedented situation and was working to create 60,000 new burial plots for the city. Italy has reported more than 3.8 million cases of coronavirus since the start of the pandemic, and over 116,000 Covid-related deaths. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Viruses mutate all the time in a bid to survive. The
challenge for scientists is to work out which mutations change how the
coronavirus behaves. Do they alter how the virus spreads, for example, do they
cause people to be more seriously ill and could they evade the protection of
vaccines? These are all questions experts will now try to answer about
the Indian variant by carrying out experiments in the lab and looking at data
on cases in the real world. So far, we know that it has two mutations â the first, E484Q
is similar to one found in the Brazilian, South African and Kent variants â and
the second, L452R has been found in a variant in California. That means it could be a concern based onwhat is known about those variants already. But the ""double mutation"" on its own isnât unusual and has
been found in other variants. Covid vaccines are still very effective at reducing the risk
of serious illness and manufacturers plan to update their vaccines in response
to the most worrying new variants. A further 34 people have died in the UK within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus, according tothe latest government figures,external. Another 2,596 people have tested positive for the disease. Meanwhile, 8,931,547 people have received their second dose of the vaccine and 32,574,221 have had their first.

Puberty blockers review group to be set up by NHS,"A new independent review group will assess the prescription of puberty blockers for under-16s, NHS England has announced. Puberty blockers are prescribed to some young people who areexperiencing gender dysphoria,external- a ""mismatch"" between their biological sex and gender identity. The announcement follows a ruling from the Family Division of the High Court in March, which said parents can consent to the treatment on behalf of their child. But the judge added it may be that ""additional safeguards"" should be built into decision-making. The case was brought after three high court judgeshad previously ruledthat children under 16 were unlikely to be able to give informed consent for the treatment. That ruling, in December, was from a case brought against the Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust which provides England's only NHS specialist gender clinic for children. NHS England said itsnew processes,externalwere being introduced on an ""interim basis"" while itawaits the outcome of a review into gender identity services,external. It said it had ""carefully reviewed"" the parental consent judgement from March along with ""significant concerns"" raised by arecent Care Quality Commission reportabout the clinic and a puberty blockers evidence review by the National Institute for Health and Care Excellence. The Tavistock and Portman NHS Trust provides England's only NHS specialist gender clinic for children The health body said that while parental consent had not been ""historically"" relied on it may be for existing patients who are already being prescribed puberty blockers. In such cases there would need to be ""full agreement"" between the child, parent(s) and clinical team as well as support from the new review group. It added that, should the review group have doubts about whether the decision-making process was ""robust"", a best interests decision could still be sought from court. Treatment will not be withdrawn for existing patients until the review group's view is known or further consideration by the court. Â·What are puberty blockers? Â·What does transgender mean and what does the law say? The same interim process will be used for new patients once the Tavistock clinic decides to resume making new referrals, NHS England said. A statement from Tavistock and Portman said it welcomed the update ""that parental consent may form a legal basis to prescribe puberty blockers to children under 16 years"". The trust added: ""We will be working with NHS England on the implications of these changes for patients currently in treatment and new referrals, and will issue more information about this as soon as we are able."" New referrals were paused in December following the High Court ruling. The review group will be made up of health and care professionals with expertise in child development, neurodevelopment and mental health. It's not clear when it will be established but NHS England said more details would be available ""in due course"". Until the group is operational a requirement for a best interests order from the court, for new patients, will remain. What are puberty blockers? What does trans mean and what is the Cass review?

Brexit and Covid blamed as 200 car jobs at risk,"Kautex Textron have had a site in Ystrad Mynach for more than 50 years More than 200 jobs are at risk at a car parts firm in south Wales. Kautex Textron said the closure of its Ystrad Mynach site in Caerphilly county was being considered, with the economic impact of Brexit and Covid ""key contributors"". The firm has confirmed provisional discussions regarding staff reductions have started with unions and employees. A consultation period between staff and management has begun, with talks set to last until at least mid-May. Kautex Textron has had a site in Ystrad Mynach for more than 50 years and makes hoses, water containers and nozzles. Brexit trade change 'challenging' for car industry UK delays Brexit border checks on EU goods again Almost 16,000 people are employed in the automotive industry in Wales - about 220 of them at Kautext Textron's site on the Dyffryn Business Park. Experts had warned thesector faced challenges because of Brexittrade changes. ""We can confirm we have entered into provisionary discussions regarding staff reductions and potentially a site closure,"" the company said. ""Brexit, as well as the ongoing economic impact of Covid-19, are the key contributors to this decision."" A ""big blow"" for the area, says Kautext Textron worker Sharon Harrison Kautext Textron worker Sharon Harrison said everyone was concerned for their future: ""What am I going to do? I've got a mortgage to pay, I've got bills to pay. ""There are quite a few families here as well, there are husbands and wives. ""Manufacturing is declining and it has been for a few years, so this is a blow - a big blow for the area. ""It's not just for us working here, it's for our supply chain too."" This video can not be played The Welsh Automotive Forum said earlier this year that new checks on imports and rules over where car parts can come from could add to customs disruption The GMB Union said it was notified by the manufacturing company before Easter that it was considering cutting the workforce and the Welsh government said it was ""working with the company"" to help save jobs. Mike Payne, the union's senior Wales and South West organiser, has had discussions with Kautext Textron management and said a ""whole site closure"" was being considered because of a ""downturn in sales in the global market"". ""It is a profitable site, but Brexit is playing a big part in this,"" he added. ""Clients are starting to argue production should be closer to their bases in continental Europe. ""It's absolutely devastating for our members at the plant but also for the local economy, the businesses that supply the plant and the Welsh manufacturing industry in general."" He toldBBC Radio Walesthe union understood the site could close in 12 to 18 months, and if it could not be saved it would enter redundancy negotiations Mr Payne added that the union was working with the company and the Welsh government to try and secure a support package to keep the site open. GMB said the company was looking at how it could expand into other products, with the potential to then cut just 44 people from the workforce. Simon Duval-Smith, former editor of the Automotive Purchasing and Supply Chain magazine, said ""Brexit is a double edged sword"" for Kautex. He toldBBC Radio Walesthat Brexit required companies to provide more forms and materials to export materials into Europe, which was a cause of the potential closure. But Mr Duval-Smith also said that since leaving the EU ""Wales is now free to offer greater incentives to companies to locate in Wales, and also to stay here"". The Welsh government said it was ""working with the company to explore potential solutions to help sustain the plant"". ""This is clearly a concerning time and we are monitoring the situation closely,"" a spokesman added.

Hancock and sister own shares in NHS contract firm,"The government denied there was any conflict of interest and said the health secretary had declared his shareholding properly Health Secretary Matt Hancock owns shares in a company which was approved as a potential supplier for NHS trusts in England, it has emerged. In March, he declared he had acquired more than 15% of Topwood Ltd, which was granted the approved status in 2019. The firm, which specialises in the secure storage, shredding and scanning of documents, also won Â£300,000 of business from NHS Wales this year. A government spokesman said there had been no conflict of interest. He also said the health secretary had acted ""entirely properly"". But Labour said there was ""cronyism at the heart of this government"" and the party's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has asked the head of the civil service to investigate whether Mr Hancock breached the ministerial code. Hancock 'had drink' with Cameron and Greensill Covid spending: MPs' contacts were given priority Hancock acted unlawfully over Covid contracts In March this year, Mr Hancock declared in the MPs' register of interests that he hadacquired more than 15% of the shares,externalin Topwood, under a ""delegated management arrangement"". Public contract records show that the company was awarded a place in the Shared Business Services framework as a potential supplier for NHS local trusts in 2019, the year after Mr Hancock became health secretary. The MPs' register did not mention that his sister Emily Gilruth - involved in the firm since its foundation in 2002 - owns a larger portion of the shares and is a director, or that Topwood has links to the NHS - as first reported by theGuido Fawkes blog,externalandHealth Service Journal,external. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""Matt Hancock has to answer the questions... He can't pretend that the responsibility lies elsewhere."" But he said he was ""not suggesting"" the health secretary had broken any rules. The SNP's deputy Westminster leader, Kirsten Oswald, said ""Tory cronyism"" was ""rife within Westminster"". But a government spokesperson said: ""Mr Hancock has acted entirely properly in these circumstances. All declarations of interest have been made in accordance with the ministerial code. Ministers have no involvement in the awarding of these contracts, and no conflict of interest arises."" A Department of Health source said Mr Hancock had discussed the fact he was to be gifted shares in the firm with civil servants before he accepted them. They ruled that if any conflicts of interest were to arise, they could be handled in line withthe ministerial code,,externalthe rulebook setting out the standards of conduct for ministers. This states that ministers should declare interests of close family if they believe they might give rise to a conflict. When he was secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport in 2017, he did declare that his brother Chris Hancock was chief executive of an investment crowdfunding company called Crowd2Fund. The Department of Health said Mr Hancock had no active role in running Topwood. As health secretary for England, he does not have responsibility for NHS Wales, which awarded contracts to Topwood earlier this year. Mr Hancock has not yet commented.

Ex-Civil Service boss 'baffled' by business links,"A former head of the Civil Service has said he is ""baffled"" that approval was given for a top civil servant to take a job at Greensill Capital while still on the government payroll. Lord Kerslake said he could ""see no circumstances"" under which Bill Crothers's appointment at the finance firm could have been ""acceptable"". The government has ordered a review which will look into his role. Labour said the dual working was evidence of a ""return to sleaze"". What jobs can ex-ministers do and what are the rules? Civil servants ordered to declare second jobs Top civil servant 'joined Greensill before quitting' What's the Greensill lobbying row about? Lord Kerslake, who ran the Civil Service under David Cameron's government and has advised the Labour Party, is the latest high-profile figure to express concern about the relationship between political figures and the now collapsed finance firm. Greensill is at the heart of a row engulfing Westminster about access, influence and lobbying, after it emerged that Mr Cameron had contacted current cabinet ministers about loans on behalf of the company, while working as a consultant there after leaving office. A government review and three separate inquiries by parliamentary committees will look at the former prime minister's role and that of Mr Crothers. The National Audit Office, which monitors public spending, has also launched an investigation in to Greensill's involvement in the government's Covid-19 financial support schemes. It says this will include the accreditation process and any subsequent monitoring of the company's activities. Bill Crothers was in charge of government procurement until 2015 Mr Crothers had stopped being head of government procurement by the time he started work as an adviser for Greensill in 2015, but remained a senior civil servant. Lord Kerslake, an independent peer, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that trust in the Civil Service was ""its most precious commodity"". He said he was ""shocked and concerned"" at recent revelations, and that ""legitimate concerns"" about how Mr Crothers - who was able to hold dual roles - needed to be ""thoroughly investigated"". ""He led on procurement, an area of absolutely intense scrutiny and where integrity is vital,"" he said, while ""the effect of what he did, if not the intent"" was to ""bypass"" the rules set out by the watchdog, Acoba, that advises ministers and officials on outside employment. ""The situation was that Greensill were active in government, even if they didn't have a contract. So I am personally baffled as to how this got approved,"" he added. Mr Crothers's appointment by joined Greensill received the go-ahead from the Cabinet Office, but he did not consult Acoba. It emerged on Thursday that he had alsofailed to alert it about another jobhe took in 2016 as a trustee with the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply. Mr Crothers apologised in a letter to Acoba for what he described an ""honest mistake"", saying he did not think he had to report the role as it was unpaid and with a not-for-profit charity. But the head of Acoba, Lord Pickles, said the rules applied to both paid and unpaid jobs and it was therefore a breach of the regulations. The Guardian newspaper has reported further links between Greensill and the Civil Service. It said David Brierwood combined a role as a Crown representative in the Cabinet Office with being a director at Greensill for three-and-a-half years. Mr Brierwood has not commented on the revelations. But a Cabinet Office spokesman said: ""Crown representatives do not participate in the procurement process nor are they able to award any contracts. ""They are part-time senior executives recruited for their working knowledge of a sector to help ensure value for money for the taxpayer. ""All Crown representatives go through regular propriety checks and cannot work with a supplier where there could be a conflict of interest. ""Mr Brierwood's Crown representative role was not anything to do with supply-chain finance."" Speaking on a visit to Edinburgh, Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer repeated his calls for a ""full, independent, transparent inquiry"". ""This has gone much wider than a single incident,"" he added, with ""story after story"" of cronyism and ""contracts for mates"". ""It is a catalogue of examples of sleaze and we have got to get to the bottom of it."" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the ""most important thing is to get to the bottom of it properly"" and that all ministers and officials have been ordered to tell the government inquiry what it needs to know.

China's economy grows 18.3% in post-Covid comebackThe record figures for the first quarter of the year are skewed due to last year's nationwide lockdownBusiness,"China's economy grew a record 18.3% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same quarter last year. It's the biggest jump in gross domestic product (GDP) since China started keeping quarterly records in 1992. However, Friday's figures are below expectations, with a Reuters poll of economists predicting 19% growth. They are also heavily skewed, and less indicative of strong growth, as they are compared to last year's huge economic contraction. In the first quarter of 2020, China's economy shrank 6.8% due to nationwide lockdowns at the peak of its Covid-19 outbreak. Chinese economy continues its pandemic bounce back China rebounds with economic growth target above 6% China takes new foreign investment top spot from US ""The national economy made a good start,"" said China's National Bureau of Statistics, which released the first quarter data. But it added: ""We must be aware that the Covid-19 epidemic is still spreading globally and the international landscape is complicated with high uncertainties and instabilities."" Other key figures released by China's statistics department also point to a continuing rebound, but are also unusually strong because they are compared against extremely weak numbers from last year. Industrial output for March rose 14.1% over a year ago, while retail sales grew 34.2%. It's ironic that China's economic boom has been announced just as its leader wrestles with the problem of climate change - which has been caused by economic growth over the decades. Historically, that growth has been almost completely fuelled by emissions from burning coal, gas and oil. China has promised to freeze its growth in emissions by 2030 and halt them totally by 2060. But President Xi is hearing from France's President Macron and Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel  that it can and should freeze emissions earlier - perhaps by 2025. Leaders of the EU and US are also urging China to stop funding new coal-fired power plants in poor nations in the so-called Belt and Road initiative. The world will suffer, they say, if African nations follow the polluting path to prosperity laid down by nations which got rich on coal. ""Promisingly, the monthly indicators suggest that industrial production, consumption and investment all gained pace in March on a sequential basis, following the weakness in the first two months,"" said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at research and consultancy firm Oxford Economics. However, some analysts predicted a number of sectors will slow as government fiscal and monetary support is reduced. Yue Su,  the Economist Intelligence Unit's principal economist for China, while the latest figures show that the country's economic recovery is broad-based, some production and export activity could have been ""front-loaded"" into the first quarter, suggesting slower growth ahead. ""Trade performance and domestic industrial activities for the rest of year might not be able to maintain such strong momentum, due to lack of measures to stimulate domestic economy,"" she said. The figures nevertheless suggest China has continued to gain economic momentum. Comparing growth for the last quarter with the last quarter of 2020, the Chinese economy grew by a far smaller 0.6%. Helped by strict virus containment measures and emergency relief for businesses, the economy has recovered steadily since the pandemic hit. Despite a calamitous start to the year, China was the only major economy to register growth in 2020 albeit its weakest in decades, at 2.3%. China has set an economic growth target of 6% for 2021, after scrapping its target last year.

"'Chance to rebuild NI' as Covid restrictions easeGrowing the economy will help to mitigate the pandemic fallout, says Economy Minister Diane Dodds.Northern Ireland","Shoppers will return to streets when all retailers in Northern Ireland can reopen at the end of April Northern Ireland can begin rebuilding its economy under plans to ease Covid-19 restrictions from next week, Economy Minister Diane Dodds has said. On Thursday the Stormont executive agreed reopening dates for some sectors, includinghairdressers, non-essential retail and hospitality. The current lockdown has been in place for more than 100 days in a bid to curb the spread of coronavirus. Mrs Dodds said precautions would still be needed to reopen businesses safely. ""But it does mean we can get on with opening our economy, recovering our economy,"" she told BBC News NI's The View programme. She said growing the economy would help to mitigate the fallout from the pandemic, including a potentially huge spike in unemployment. The announcement has received acautious welcome from businesses. What you need to know about NI's lockdown easing Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey told The View she was glad the executive had reached consensus. ""There was no dissent around the table - it [was] a good day to give hope to the public,"" she said. Peter McCleery, who runs a cafe in Comber, County Down, said that preparing to resume trade would be like opening a new business. The cafe has no outdoor space so it is due to open on 24 May, several weeks after hospitality businesses that have outdoor facilities. Shutters are set be lifted from the doors of pubs in Northern Ireland for the first time this year ""Even with those dates we have to plan ahead and recruit staff and train staff,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""We're starting again from a fresh sheet - we're looking forward to it."" The owner of a County Armagh hotel situated a short distance from the Irish border said he was concerned that business that would have to deal with the consequences of the differing restrictions in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Jason Foody said it was not the job of his hotel staff ""to police the roads and people that come through our door"". The Republic of Ireland hasrecently lifted the 5km (three miles) travel limitthat applied under its highest level of restrictions. Business owners have been busy preparing their premises for reopening Mr Foody said: ""Previously if we were seeing [people with] addresses... from areas that shouldn't have travelled we were saying it to them but people have to travel for different reasons too and if it's for essential reasons you can't stop them. He said the hotel was ""getting a huge amount of calls"" from people in the Republic of Ireland who were wanting to book a stay. Jules Stothard, who owns a pub in Dromara, County Down, said her business had been open for about three months over the past 13 months. She would be ""ecstatic"" to see her customers again but had a ""bit of anxiety about the financial side"". ""We are grateful to the government for the grant but every penny we have had has gone,"" she said. ""We were so ecstatic that we could open again but then reality strikes - we won't have the customers at the capacity to sustain our business without help."" Outdoor dining and drinking at cafes and bars will be allowed from 30 April Tourist attractions also face challenges when they reopen - the Marble Arch Caves in County Fermanagh will have reduced capacity for its tours, says its manager Kate McGrath. ""We will get there but need to clarify bubble numbers,"" she added. Proposed dates leaked to the media on Thursday had suggested outdoor hospitality for pubs would have to wait until 10 May before being allowed to welcome back customers, with indoor venues not reopening before 1 June. However, Mrs Dodds had raised concerns in a letter to the first and deputy first ministers about the proposed dates, saying it was her preference for unlicensed premises to open earlier, on 23 April, followed later by licenced premises.

What you need to know about NI's lockdown easing Communities Minister Deirdre Hargey told The View she was glad the executive had reached consensus. ""There was no dissent around the table - it [was] a good day to give hope to the public,"" she said. Peter McCleery, who runs a cafe in Comber, County Down, said that preparing to resume trade would be like opening a new business. The cafe has no outdoor space so it is due to open on 24 May, several weeks after hospitality businesses that have outdoor facilities. Shutters are set be lifted from the doors of pubs in Northern Ireland for the first time this year ""Even with those dates we have to plan ahead and recruit staff and train staff,"" he told BBC Radio Ulster's Good Morning Ulster programme. ""We're starting again from a fresh sheet - we're looking forward to it."" The owner of a County Armagh hotel situated a short distance from the Irish border said he was concerned that business that would have to deal with the consequences of the differing restrictions in Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. Jason Foody said it was not the job of his hotel staff ""to police the roads and people that come through our door"". The Republic of Ireland hasrecently lifted the 5km (three miles) travel limitthat applied under its highest level of restrictions. Business owners have been busy preparing their premises for reopening Mr Foody said: ""Previously if we were seeing [people with] addresses... from areas that shouldn't have travelled we were saying it to them but people have to travel for different reasons too and if it's for essential reasons you can't stop them. He said the hotel was ""getting a huge amount of calls"" from people in the Republic of Ireland who were wanting to book a stay. Jules Stothard, who owns a pub in Dromara, County Down, said her business had been open for about three months over the past 13 months. She would be ""ecstatic"" to see her customers again but had a ""bit of anxiety about the financial side"". ""We are grateful to the government for the grant but every penny we have had has gone,"" she said. ""We were so ecstatic that we could open again but then reality strikes - we won't have the customers at the capacity to sustain our business without help."" Outdoor dining and drinking at cafes and bars will be allowed from 30 April Tourist attractions also face challenges when they reopen - the Marble Arch Caves in County Fermanagh will have reduced capacity for its tours, says its manager Kate McGrath. ""We will get there but need to clarify bubble numbers,"" she added. Proposed dates leaked to the media on Thursday had suggested outdoor hospitality for pubs would have to wait until 10 May before being allowed to welcome back customers, with indoor venues not reopening before 1 June. However, Mrs Dodds had raised concerns in a letter to the first and deputy first ministers about the proposed dates, saying it was her preference for unlicensed premises to open earlier, on 23 April, followed later by licenced premises.

The country has been vaccinating school managers and those aged above 50, elderly citizens and front-line workers. More than 500,000 people have had the AstraZeneca jab out of the more than one million doses delivered to the country. All teachers and non-teaching staff in schools should have the jab before schools reopen on 10 May, the president says. According to the head of Kenya's Teachers Service Commission, Nancy Macharia, 15 primary teachers, three deputy headteachers and eight headteachers have died of Covid-19 during the pandemic.

The announcement, from the Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation, brings the UK in line with other countries. Dr Mary Ross-Davie, director for professional midwifery and Covid vaccine lead at the Royal College of Midwives, says the move is a ""welcome"" and ""sensible step"". ""It empowers pregnant women to make their own decisions about whether or not to receive the vaccine,"" she says. ""Ultimately it will be a womanâs choice and midwives and obstetricians will be there to support them to make an informed decision that is right for them."" Up until now, the advice for women has been to discuss having a vaccine with their GP if their risk of exposure to the virus is high or if they have underlying health conditions which put them at higher risk of Covid complications.

People who are pregnant should be offered a Covid vaccine at the same time as the rest of the population based on their age and clinical risk group, new official advice says. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) says there are ""no specific safety concerns"" identified with ""any brand of Covid-19 vaccines"" in relation to pregnancy. The JCVI said data from the US showed around 90,000 pregnant women had received jabs, mainly the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, ""without any safety concerns being raised"". It therefore advises that it is ""preferable"" for pregnant women in the UK to be offered these two vaccines where available, adding: ""There is no evidence to suggest that other vaccines are unsafe for pregnant women, but more research is needed."" We'll bring you more details as we get them. One in six UK adults are now fully vaccinated against Covid, with more than two million second doses given in the past week,according to the latest figures,external. As we reported a little earlier, more than 8.9 million people have now received both doses - the equivalent of 17.0% of the adult population. Breaking that down by nation, Wales is estimated to have given two doses to nearly a quarter of adults at 22.8%. In Northern Ireland it stands at 17.2%, in England it's 16.8% and in Scotland it's 15.5%. The figures are for vaccinations reported by the UK's health agencies up to 15 April. A hearse with a placard that reads: ""Sorry, but they won't let us bury your loved ones"" Funeral workers in Italy's capital city, Rome, are protesting over a build-up of bodies at cemeteries amid a backlog of burials and cremations following a surge in coronavirus deaths. More than 2,000 bodies are being stored at Rome's main crematorium, which can carry out about 50 cremations a day, while other cemeteries in the city are also full, Reuters news agency reports. ""Every few days we are told the cemeteries are blocked and
they haven't got any more room to take in the dead,"" head of Italy's federation of funeral
workers, Giovanni Caciolli, says. Workers have placed wreaths on display in hearse vehicles that read: ""Sorry, but they won't let us bury your loved ones."" The city's authorities responsible for handling burials and cremations, AMA, said in a statement this week it was facing an unprecedented situation and was working to create 60,000 new burial plots for the city. Italy has reported more than 3.8 million cases of coronavirus since the start of the pandemic, and over 116,000 Covid-related deaths. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Viruses mutate all the time in a bid to survive. The
challenge for scientists is to work out which mutations change how the
coronavirus behaves. Do they alter how the virus spreads, for example, do they
cause people to be more seriously ill and could they evade the protection of
vaccines? These are all questions experts will now try to answer about
the Indian variant by carrying out experiments in the lab and looking at data
on cases in the real world. So far, we know that it has two mutations â the first, E484Q
is similar to one found in the Brazilian, South African and Kent variants â and
the second, L452R has been found in a variant in California. That means it could be a concern based onwhat is known about those variants already. But the ""double mutation"" on its own isnât unusual and has
been found in other variants. Covid vaccines are still very effective at reducing the risk
of serious illness and manufacturers plan to update their vaccines in response
to the most worrying new variants. A further 34 people have died in the UK within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus, according tothe latest government figures,external. Another 2,596 people have tested positive for the disease. Meanwhile, 8,931,547 people have received their second dose of the vaccine and 32,574,221 have had their first.

of serious illness and manufacturers plan to update their vaccines in response

Who is going to Prince Philip's funeral?Covid restrictions mean only 30 mourners will be allowed to attend the funeral of the duke.UK,"The Duke of Edinburgh was given a ceremonial funeral at Windsor with bands and a military escort. Only 30 mourners were allowed to attend because of coronavirus restrictions. These are the guests who were at the service in St George's Chapel, Windsor, on Saturday 17 April. The Queen said Prince Philip had ""quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years"". The Queen joined the procession to the chapel in the state Bentley, following behind the walking members of the Royal Family and staff. She married the duke in 1947, five years before she became Queen on the death of her father King George VI. Her constant companion, the duke was the longest-serving consort of any British monarch. He retired from royal duties in 2017 having completed more than 22,000 solo engagements. Prince Charles said his father was a ""much-loved and appreciated figure"" and he and the Royal Family would miss him greatly. He added that over the last 70 years his father had ""given the most remarkable, devoted service to the Queen, to my family and to the country, but also to the whole of the Commonwealth"". Prince Charles is the Queen's eldest son and first in line to the throne. The prince walked behind the Land Rover in the procession, alongside other members of the Royal Family and household staff. Camilla married Prince Charles in April 2005, although they had been close friends since the 1970s. Both had been married previously, Charles to Diana, who died in a car crash in 1997, and Camilla to cavalry officer Andrew Parker Bowles, whom she divorced in 1995. The couple first met at a Windsor polo match in 1970. In April 2012, the Queen made the duchess a Dame Grand Cross, the highest female rank in the Royal Victorian Order. Princess Anne said her father was her ""teacher, supporter and critic"". The duke's only daughter said he would leave a ""legacy which can inspire us all"". She said she ""most wanted to emulate"" her father's example of a ""life well-lived and service freely given"". The Princess Royal and other members of the Royal Family walked in procession behind the Land Rover which carried the duke's coffin. Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence married the Princess Royal in 1992. He is her second husband. He joined his wife and other members of the Royal Family in procession behind the Land Rover which carried the duke's coffin. Prince Andrew said his father's death was a terrible loss: ""We've lost the grandfather of the nation."" Speaking of his father, Prince Andrew said: ""He was so calm. He was always somebody you could go to and he would always listen so it's a great loss. Prince Andrew and other members of the Royal Family walked in procession behind the Land Rover which carried the duke's coffin. Prince Andrew stepped back from royal duties in 2019 after criticism of his ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein intensified following a BBC interview. Prince Edward said his father had been ""a great source of support and encouragement and guidance"" all the way through his life. ""He's always been there as that rock in the Queen's life. Certainly within his family that was exactly the same,"" he said. After a brief period with the Royal Marines, the prince formed his own TV production company but now supports the Queen in her official duties and carries out public engagements for charities. He joined his brothers, sister and other members of the Royal Family in the procession behind the Land Rover which carried the duke's coffin.

The prince, second in line to the throne after his father Charles, said he would miss the duke, who would have wanted the family ""to get on with the job"". He joined other members of the Royal Family walking in procession behind the Land Rover which carried the duke's coffin. The prince, who was 15 when his mother Diana died, is married to Catherine and they have three children. Kate Middleton became Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, after marrying Prince William in 2011. They have three children - George, Charlotte and Louis,  all under 10 years old. The duchess supports a number of charitable causes and organisations, several of which are centred around providing children with the best possible start in life. She is also a keen photographer and known for taking candid snaps of the Royal Family. Prince Harry said his grandfather was ""a man of service, honour and great humour"" and the ""legend of banter"". He joined other members of the Royal Family walking in procession behind the Land Rover which carried the duke's coffin. The funeral is the first time that Prince Harry has visited the UK since he and his wife Meghan stepped back from royal duties last March. Meghan is pregnant with their second child and remained at the couple's home in California, after being advised by her doctor not to travel.

He has a young son called Wolfie with Dara Huang, his ex-fiancee. Edoardo and Princess Beatrice are said to have started a relationship after her sister Princess Eugenie's wedding to Jack Brooksbank in October 2018.

He met the princess through their mutual love of skiing, with friends introducing them while they were in Verbier, Switzerland. The couple have one child. Mr Brooksbank started working life in the hospitality industry, eventually becoming manager of a club which was often attended by Prince Harry and Princess Beatrice. After helping to launch a Mexican-themed pub in Chelsea, co-founded by Harry's friend Guy Pelly, he got a job as a brand ambassador for a tequila manufacturer. Lady Louise Windsor is the elder child of the Earl and Countess of Wessex. The couple decided to give their children ""courtesy"" titles as sons or daughters of an earl, rather than the style prince or princess.

His grandmother, Princess Theodora of Greece and Denmark, was the duke's second eldest sister. She married a German nobleman, Berthold, Margrave of Baden, who served as a German officer in World War Two. As such, the couple did not attend the duke's wedding in 1947. Prince Bernhard manages the family estates and the wineries in Germany. Prince Donatus represented the families of Prince Philip's two younger sisters, Sophie and Cecilie, who both married into the Hesse family. Princess Sophie spent time with the Queen and Prince Philip at Balmoral after their marriage, despite not being invited to the wedding because her husband was a German officer.

Prince Donatus has often been a guest of the Queen and Prince Philip at the Windsor horse show.

China's economy grows 18.3% in post-Covid comeback,"China's economy grew a record 18.3% in the first quarter of 2021 compared to the same quarter last year. It's the biggest jump in gross domestic product (GDP) since China started keeping quarterly records in 1992. However, Friday's figures are below expectations, with a Reuters poll of economists predicting 19% growth. They are also heavily skewed, and less indicative of strong growth, as they are compared to last year's huge economic contraction. In the first quarter of 2020, China's economy shrank 6.8% due to nationwide lockdowns at the peak of its Covid-19 outbreak. Chinese economy continues its pandemic bounce back China rebounds with economic growth target above 6% China takes new foreign investment top spot from US ""The national economy made a good start,"" said China's National Bureau of Statistics, which released the first quarter data. But it added: ""We must be aware that the Covid-19 epidemic is still spreading globally and the international landscape is complicated with high uncertainties and instabilities."" Other key figures released by China's statistics department also point to a continuing rebound, but are also unusually strong because they are compared against extremely weak numbers from last year. Industrial output for March rose 14.1% over a year ago, while retail sales grew 34.2%. It's ironic that China's economic boom has been announced just as its leader wrestles with the problem of climate change - which has been caused by economic growth over the decades. Historically, that growth has been almost completely fuelled by emissions from burning coal, gas and oil. China has promised to freeze its growth in emissions by 2030 and halt them totally by 2060. But President Xi is hearing from France's President Macron and Germany's Chancellor Angela Merkel  that it can and should freeze emissions earlier - perhaps by 2025. Leaders of the EU and US are also urging China to stop funding new coal-fired power plants in poor nations in the so-called Belt and Road initiative. The world will suffer, they say, if African nations follow the polluting path to prosperity laid down by nations which got rich on coal. ""Promisingly, the monthly indicators suggest that industrial production, consumption and investment all gained pace in March on a sequential basis, following the weakness in the first two months,"" said Louis Kuijs, head of Asia economics at research and consultancy firm Oxford Economics. However, some analysts predicted a number of sectors will slow as government fiscal and monetary support is reduced. Yue Su,  the Economist Intelligence Unit's principal economist for China, while the latest figures show that the country's economic recovery is broad-based, some production and export activity could have been ""front-loaded"" into the first quarter, suggesting slower growth ahead. ""Trade performance and domestic industrial activities for the rest of year might not be able to maintain such strong momentum, due to lack of measures to stimulate domestic economy,"" she said. The figures nevertheless suggest China has continued to gain economic momentum. Comparing growth for the last quarter with the last quarter of 2020, the Chinese economy grew by a far smaller 0.6%. Helped by strict virus containment measures and emergency relief for businesses, the economy has recovered steadily since the pandemic hit. Despite a calamitous start to the year, China was the only major economy to register growth in 2020 albeit its weakest in decades, at 2.3%. China has set an economic growth target of 6% for 2021, after scrapping its target last year.

"Hancock and sister own shares in NHS contract firmThe health secretary is accused of ""cronyism"" but the government says he acted ""entirely properly"".UK Politics","The government denied there was any conflict of interest and said the health secretary had declared his shareholding properly Health Secretary Matt Hancock owns shares in a company which was approved as a potential supplier for NHS trusts in England, it has emerged. In March, he declared he had acquired more than 15% of Topwood Ltd, which was granted the approved status in 2019. The firm, which specialises in the secure storage, shredding and scanning of documents, also won Â£300,000 of business from NHS Wales this year. A government spokesman said there had been no conflict of interest. He also said the health secretary had acted ""entirely properly"". But Labour said there was ""cronyism at the heart of this government"" and the party's shadow health secretary Jonathan Ashworth has asked the head of the civil service to investigate whether Mr Hancock breached the ministerial code. Hancock 'had drink' with Cameron and Greensill Covid spending: MPs' contacts were given priority Hancock acted unlawfully over Covid contracts In March this year, Mr Hancock declared in the MPs' register of interests that he hadacquired more than 15% of the shares,externalin Topwood, under a ""delegated management arrangement"". Public contract records show that the company was awarded a place in the Shared Business Services framework as a potential supplier for NHS local trusts in 2019, the year after Mr Hancock became health secretary. The MPs' register did not mention that his sister Emily Gilruth - involved in the firm since its foundation in 2002 - owns a larger portion of the shares and is a director, or that Topwood has links to the NHS - as first reported by theGuido Fawkes blog,externalandHealth Service Journal,external. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said: ""Matt Hancock has to answer the questions... He can't pretend that the responsibility lies elsewhere."" But he said he was ""not suggesting"" the health secretary had broken any rules. The SNP's deputy Westminster leader, Kirsten Oswald, said ""Tory cronyism"" was ""rife within Westminster"". But a government spokesperson said: ""Mr Hancock has acted entirely properly in these circumstances. All declarations of interest have been made in accordance with the ministerial code. Ministers have no involvement in the awarding of these contracts, and no conflict of interest arises."" A Department of Health source said Mr Hancock had discussed the fact he was to be gifted shares in the firm with civil servants before he accepted them. They ruled that if any conflicts of interest were to arise, they could be handled in line withthe ministerial code,,externalthe rulebook setting out the standards of conduct for ministers. This states that ministers should declare interests of close family if they believe they might give rise to a conflict. When he was secretary of state for digital, culture, media and sport in 2017, he did declare that his brother Chris Hancock was chief executive of an investment crowdfunding company called Crowd2Fund. The Department of Health said Mr Hancock had no active role in running Topwood. As health secretary for England, he does not have responsibility for NHS Wales, which awarded contracts to Topwood earlier this year. Mr Hancock has not yet commented.

However, there are vast differences in the pace of progress in different parts of the world. With an aim to give doses to nearly every adult around the world, this is the largest vaccination programme in history. The US and China have administered the highest number of doses, 198 million and 183 million respectively. India ranks third, with more than 117 million. But while nearly all of Europe and the Americas have begun vaccination campaigns,some countries in Africa are still to get started.

vaccines? These are all questions experts will now try to answer about
the Indian variant by carrying out experiments in the lab and looking at data

The image shows 85-year-old Brazilian woman Rosa getting her first embrace from nurse Adriana through a transparent hug curtain. The photographer Mads Nissen toldBBC World Newsthat he was covering the Covid crisis in Brazil which has been one of the countries most affected by the crisis. âI was photographing the graveyards, the cemeteries where people were mourning, hospitals, the ambulances, but I also felt there was need for a different kind of picture,â he said. He wanted a picture which could show âthis certain Latin American spirit to fight and find love even in the most dark hour"". Brazil has thesecond highest death tollin the world from Covid-19. People who are pregnant should be offered a Covid vaccine at the same time as the rest of the population based on their age and clinical risk group, new official advice says. The Joint Committee on Vaccination and Immunisation (JCVI) says there are ""no specific safety concerns"" identified with ""any brand of Covid-19 vaccines"" in relation to pregnancy. The JCVI said data from the US showed around 90,000 pregnant women had received jabs, mainly the Pfizer and Moderna vaccines, ""without any safety concerns being raised"". It therefore advises that it is ""preferable"" for pregnant women in the UK to be offered these two vaccines where available, adding: ""There is no evidence to suggest that other vaccines are unsafe for pregnant women, but more research is needed."" We'll bring you more details as we get them. One in six UK adults are now fully vaccinated against Covid, with more than two million second doses given in the past week,according to the latest figures,external. As we reported a little earlier, more than 8.9 million people have now received both doses - the equivalent of 17.0% of the adult population. Breaking that down by nation, Wales is estimated to have given two doses to nearly a quarter of adults at 22.8%. In Northern Ireland it stands at 17.2%, in England it's 16.8% and in Scotland it's 15.5%. The figures are for vaccinations reported by the UK's health agencies up to 15 April. A hearse with a placard that reads: ""Sorry, but they won't let us bury your loved ones"" Funeral workers in Italy's capital city, Rome, are protesting over a build-up of bodies at cemeteries amid a backlog of burials and cremations following a surge in coronavirus deaths. More than 2,000 bodies are being stored at Rome's main crematorium, which can carry out about 50 cremations a day, while other cemeteries in the city are also full, Reuters news agency reports. ""Every few days we are told the cemeteries are blocked and
they haven't got any more room to take in the dead,"" head of Italy's federation of funeral
workers, Giovanni Caciolli, says. Workers have placed wreaths on display in hearse vehicles that read: ""Sorry, but they won't let us bury your loved ones."" The city's authorities responsible for handling burials and cremations, AMA, said in a statement this week it was facing an unprecedented situation and was working to create 60,000 new burial plots for the city. Italy has reported more than 3.8 million cases of coronavirus since the start of the pandemic, and over 116,000 Covid-related deaths. Philippa RoxbyHealth reporter, BBC News Viruses mutate all the time in a bid to survive. The
challenge for scientists is to work out which mutations change how the
coronavirus behaves. Do they alter how the virus spreads, for example, do they
cause people to be more seriously ill and could they evade the protection of
vaccines? These are all questions experts will now try to answer about
the Indian variant by carrying out experiments in the lab and looking at data
on cases in the real world. So far, we know that it has two mutations â the first, E484Q
is similar to one found in the Brazilian, South African and Kent variants â and
the second, L452R has been found in a variant in California. That means it could be a concern based onwhat is known about those variants already. But the ""double mutation"" on its own isnât unusual and has
been found in other variants. Covid vaccines are still very effective at reducing the risk
of serious illness and manufacturers plan to update their vaccines in response
to the most worrying new variants. A further 34 people have died in the UK within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus, according tothe latest government figures,external. Another 2,596 people have tested positive for the disease. Meanwhile, 8,931,547 people have received their second dose of the vaccine and 32,574,221 have had their first.

NI ministers agree plan to ease restrictionsReopening dates were announced at Stormont following a meeting of the executive.Northern Ireland,"Unlicensed and licensed premises such as restaurants, beer gardens, and cafes can open outdoors earlier than expected, as can gyms. Non-essential retail will reopen from 30 April. Two more coronavirus-related deaths were reported by the Department of Health on Thursday, bring its death toll to 2,132 A further 159 people have tested positive for Covid-19 There are 76 people in hospital with Covid-19 - eight of them are in intensive care That concludes our live coverage of the announcement that there will be significant easing of coronavirus restrictions in Northern Ireland from 23 April onwards. Here's a reminder of those changes. That's all from us, have a good evening and stay safe. The chair of the British Medical Association in NI, Dr Tom Black has urged everyone in Northern Ireland to continue following public health regulations as further Covid-19 restrictions begin to ease. âAs these restrictions are lifted here we need everyone to continue to follow the social distancing and face covering guidance,"" he says. ""We also need to watch the data and be ready to act quickly if we see numbers rising again.â Dr Black has called on greater coordination between Stormont and the Irish government to help minimise any potential further outbreaks of the virus. ""Unlike the rest of the UK, we share a border with the Republic of Ireland and, as infection rates in the Derry and Strabane border area is currently showing us, greater coordination on public health measures is needed between the two jurisdictions."" Belfast
Chamber has said it is glad that dates have finally been provided for businesses to reopen. ""Every day, I speak with
business owners who are in distress and despair and were becoming devoid of
hope,"" the chamber's Simon Hamilton said. ""We firmly believed that the amazing speed and scale of the
vaccination roll-out and the continually improving health data justified giving
those businesses indicative dates for reopening.  ""Thankfully, retail, close contact services, hospitality, leisure and tourism businesses now have clear reopening dates that are significantly better than those mooted in the media this morning. ""They can now plan and prepare for trading again in just a few weeksâ time. ""We now look forward to working with departments and the council to deliver a safe reopening of our cityâs economy."" Infrastructure Minister Nichola Mallonhas confirmed action plans for a priority booking system for driving tests,externalfollowing the executiveâs decision to reinstate practical driving tests from 23 April. Between now and 26 April, those customers affected by the restrictions and who had their appointments cancelled and fee refunded will be advised by the DVA how they can book a new test date before the booking system will open in three phases. âAll driving test services across these islands are experiencing high demand with longer than usual waiting times, like all public facing services, the Covid restrictions mean that the DVA has had to adapt its services to ensure that they can be provided safely,"" the minister said. ""The department, the DVA and I remain committed to minimising disruption and ensuring our plan for the restoration of services is in hand, and most importantly remain committed to protecting the lives of staff and customers during this pandemic.â Andrew Lynas, of Lynas Foodservice, says he would have liked to see quicker reopening. ""But at least weâve got clarity on outdoor dates and then I
think the big one for us will be 24 May when we get indoor hospitality â hotels
etc,"" he said. ""It's some dates for us to move towards, for our customers to move towards and it gives us a bit of hope. ""I think there was real despair and despondency this morning. At least we have a bit more clarity and we have some dates ""Iâm going home happier â I wouldnât say happy, but happier."" Independent MLA Claire Sugden has a question from the caravanners out there. Does the easing of restrictions apply to touring caravans or just to statics? Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill says that at the moment it's just the static caravans. Tourers will have to wait for a further announcement.  How confident are the ministers that their easement strategy wonât result to a spike in cases, asks Gerry Carroll. âThereâs a whole lot of factors which mean we donât know what the scenario will be in a couple of months time,â responds Michelle OâNeill. The deputy first minister says the executive discussed how best to encourage adherence to the regulations. Mr Caroll, the People Before Profit MLA, asks if the ministers will look at the vaccination criteria âto include people in retail, hospitality and especially people in schoolsâ. The priority is set out by the Joint Committee on Vaccine and Immunisation, responds First Minister Arlene Foster. Retail NI chief executive Glyn Roberts says today's announcement that non-essential retail, close contact services and hospitality now have dates to reopen is a ""significant step
forward"". Mr Roberts says 30 April is a ""hugely important day"" and calls on the NI executive to work with
industry groups and councils on the preparation for the reopening of high
streets. âPublic hand sanitisers, Covid marshals and agreed Covid compliance signage for businesses all need to be in place ahead of reopening to reassure consumers that our high streets are safe to return to and also to reduce levels of the transmission of the virus,"" he says. âThere
is a lot of hard work ahead of reopening, but today is real progressâ. Northern Ireland Assembly When will we see the removal of social distancing and mandatory face masks? Thatâs the question from Paul Givan of the DUP. Michelle OâNeill responds that âyou canât close your eyes and ignore the fact that weâre still in a pandemicâ. âWe need to try and avoid any further lockdown scenarios,â adds the deputy first minister. She adds that lockdowns were ânecessary at different times throughout the pandemicâ. The SDLP's Justin McNulty asks if he will be able to be present at the birth of his son, who is expected on 20 April. Congratulations ring out from around the chamber. ""You've given the gender away and everything. I hope that was discussed at home and you're not going to get a clip,"" says Michelle O'Neill. The deputy first minister says the issue was discussed at the executive meeting today and that she hopes it works for Mr McNulty. ""At least you can't say you were bored,"" chips in Speaker Alex Maskey.  Alliance MLA Paula Bradshaw says there has been much discussion about mental health in relation to the pandemic, but asks what consideration has been given to the impact on the physical health of the population. First Minister Arlene Foster acknowledges there has been a ""concentration"" on the mental health and well-being of the population ""for very obvious reasons"". She adds that the executive has always encouraged people ""to take some exercise if they can"". Mrs Foster said she thought the minister for communities and minister for health would want to look at physical well-being. ""The minister for education is very keen that young people get back to sport as quickly as possible - sport is now allowed within schools - however inter-school sports is still not in a place where we can see that happening simply because we cannot involve too much mixing in terms of the inter-schools but we hope that that can happen in the near future.""  Health Minister Robin Swann has said Northern Ireland ""is moving
in the right direction and
itâs important to bring optimism and certainty to this improving picture"". He added: âAs we
look forward to a better summer, we must not lose sight of the fact that the
virus is still a threat. ""The more we increase vaccination uptake rate, the more we strengthen our defences. âThe executiveâs phased and gradual approach to easing restrictions is the right one. Opening everything up at the same time would not be the responsible way forward. ""We must not jeopardise the progress we have made.â Northern Ireland Assembly Michelle OâNeill tells MLAs that she recently got a her first dose of the Covid-19 vaccine at her GP. âTo get that call is just fantastic, and you feel so liberated by it,â adds the deputy first minister. She says âwhy weâre able to make these announcements today is in part because of the sacrifice of the public, because of the work of the health care staff and because of the vaccination team and the rollout of the vaccination programmeâ. Northern Ireland Assembly Christopher Stalford of the DUP says people are âsick to the back teeth of restrictionsâ - particularly young people studying at university who want to return to classrooms. Arlene Foster responds that courses which have practical teaching, such as medicine, are taught face-to-face, while those which can be taught online are being taught online. The first minister accepts that students are missing âthat critical experienceâ of university life. Northern Ireland Assembly Robbie Butler of the Ulster Unionist Party talks about the wedding industry, âwhich has been hit hardâ. He asks the first and deputy first ministers to outline âif there are any other funding opportunities between now and weddings actually happeningâ for those who âfell between the gapsâ. Arlene Foster responds that âwe have not reached a point where we can have wedding receptions indoors just yetâ. The first minister adds âthey do need time to plan, people need to knowâ. âI have emails from people who have changed their weddings three, four times,â she says, adding âtheyâll certainly not forget their wedding when they finally get thereâ. Caoimhe Archibald of Sinn FÃ©in asks if the executive will continue to provide ongoing support for businesses that continue to be affected by the restrictions. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill says there's no doubt that the tourism and hospitality sectors ""have been the worst impacted"". She says the amount paid to support the hospitality sector ""is double what's paid elsewhere"". Ms ONeill says the executive has decided to continue with the grant-aid support for the hospitality sector and for gyms ""until we get to the end"". SDLP MLA Colin McGrath says ""a lot of what has been announced"" today in terms of the easing of restrictions is ""indicative"" and ""falls short"" of ""what a lot of people will want in their sectors"". He asks whether Mrs Foster and Ms O'Neill will commit to publishing the data and indicators that would be used ""to make these important decisions"".   Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill says that ""it is incorrect to say a lot of this is not clear"" and there is only one section of the announcements that is ""indicative"" - which is the further end as you would expect"". ""That is just because we need to judge it based on the prevailing health circumstances at that time,"" she says. ""The indicative section refers to 24 May and that's because we are trying to give people the ability to plan and all being well and with the public's support these will be the confirmed dates."" Ms O'Neill said there was a ""considerable"" amount of data ""put out"" by the Department of Health and she was ""more than content"" for that to continue to be shared.  Northern Ireland Assembly Pam Cameron is the deputy chair of the health committee and wants to know if thereâs been any agreement on a passenger locator form for those travelling to NI from the Republic of Ireland. Thatâs something that hasnât yet been resolved, says Arlene Foster. The first minister adds that earlier today, the chief scientific adviser outlined the possible outcomes and spread of the virus in the six months at the executive. âFrom what weâve seen there will be new variants unfortunatelyâ of Covid-19, says Mrs Foster. Is the test, trace and protect system able to cope with the âincreased burdenâ that PCR testing of all contacts of a positive case will place on the system, asks DUP MLA Ms Cameron. Michelle OâNeill says the system âneeds to be 100% perfectâ and âactively finding cases and dealing with them head onâ. The deputy first minister adds that âwe need to try and avoidâ another circuit of lockdown. Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill says this is a good day: ""Itâs a day of optimism. Itâs a day where we can look forward in the hope of a brighter future for all."" She says the restrictions have been necessary to suppress the virus, save lives and protect the health service ""but they have taken their toll"". It's time to move forward ""with caution and have maximum mitigations in place"". The deputy first minister notes that people have been living
under the current lockdown for 110 days. She says the
executive knows that âour people need hope and that our people need us to take
some steps out of restrictionsâ. âTake care
of yourselves and each other,â says Ms OâNeill. She offers
some indicative times for future easements. From 24 May the executive hopes to: Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."

Who is going to Prince Philip's funeral?Covid restrictions mean only 30 guests will be allowed to attend the funeral of the duke.UK,"The Duke of Edinburgh was given a ceremonial funeral at Windsor with bands and a military escort. Only 30 mourners were allowed to attend because of coronavirus restrictions. These are the guests who were at the service in St George's Chapel, Windsor, on Saturday 17 April. The Queen said Prince Philip had ""quite simply, been my strength and stay all these years"". The Queen joined the procession to the chapel in the state Bentley, following behind the walking members of the Royal Family and staff. She married the duke in 1947, five years before she became Queen on the death of her father King George VI. Her constant companion, the duke was the longest-serving consort of any British monarch. He retired from royal duties in 2017 having completed more than 22,000 solo engagements. Prince Charles said his father was a ""much-loved and appreciated figure"" and he and the Royal Family would miss him greatly. He added that over the last 70 years his father had ""given the most remarkable, devoted service to the Queen, to my family and to the country, but also to the whole of the Commonwealth"". Prince Charles is the Queen's eldest son and first in line to the throne. The prince walked behind the Land Rover in the procession, alongside other members of the Royal Family and household staff. Camilla married Prince Charles in April 2005, although they had been close friends since the 1970s. Both had been married previously, Charles to Diana, who died in a car crash in 1997, and Camilla to cavalry officer Andrew Parker Bowles, whom she divorced in 1995. The couple first met at a Windsor polo match in 1970. In April 2012, the Queen made the duchess a Dame Grand Cross, the highest female rank in the Royal Victorian Order. Princess Anne said her father was her ""teacher, supporter and critic"". The duke's only daughter said he would leave a ""legacy which can inspire us all"". She said she ""most wanted to emulate"" her father's example of a ""life well-lived and service freely given"". The Princess Royal and other members of the Royal Family walked in procession behind the Land Rover which carried the duke's coffin. Vice Admiral Sir Timothy Laurence married the Princess Royal in 1992. He is her second husband. He joined his wife and other members of the Royal Family in procession behind the Land Rover which carried the duke's coffin. Prince Andrew said his father's death was a terrible loss: ""We've lost the grandfather of the nation."" Speaking of his father, Prince Andrew said: ""He was so calm. He was always somebody you could go to and he would always listen so it's a great loss. Prince Andrew and other members of the Royal Family walked in procession behind the Land Rover which carried the duke's coffin. Prince Andrew stepped back from royal duties in 2019 after criticism of his ties to convicted sex offender Jeffrey Epstein intensified following a BBC interview. Prince Edward said his father had been ""a great source of support and encouragement and guidance"" all the way through his life. ""He's always been there as that rock in the Queen's life. Certainly within his family that was exactly the same,"" he said. After a brief period with the Royal Marines, the prince formed his own TV production company but now supports the Queen in her official duties and carries out public engagements for charities. He joined his brothers, sister and other members of the Royal Family in the procession behind the Land Rover which carried the duke's coffin. Sophie Rhys-Jones became the Countess of Wessex after marrying Prince Edward in 1999. The Countess of Wessex carries out royal duties and also visits a large number of her own charities and organisations. The earl and countess have two children. Prince William paid tribute to the Duke of Edinburgh, saying his ""grandfatherâs century of life was defined by service - to his country and Commonwealth, to his wife and Queen, and to our family"". The prince, second in line to the throne after his father Charles, said he would miss the duke, who would have wanted the family ""to get on with the job"". He joined other members of the Royal Family walking in procession behind the Land Rover which carried the duke's coffin. The prince, who was 15 when his mother Diana died, is married to Catherine and they have three children. Kate Middleton became Catherine, the Duchess of Cambridge, after marrying Prince William in 2011. They have three children - George, Charlotte and Louis,  all under 10 years old. The duchess supports a number of charitable causes and organisations, several of which are centred around providing children with the best possible start in life. She is also a keen photographer and known for taking candid snaps of the Royal Family. Prince Harry said his grandfather was ""a man of service, honour and great humour"" and the ""legend of banter"". He joined other members of the Royal Family walking in procession behind the Land Rover which carried the duke's coffin. The funeral is the first time that Prince Harry has visited the UK since he and his wife Meghan stepped back from royal duties last March. Meghan is pregnant with their second child and remained at the couple's home in California, after being advised by her doctor not to travel. Peter Phillips is the Queen and Duke of Edinburghâs eldest grandchild. He is the son of Princess Anne and her first husband, Captain Mark Phillips. He joined other members of the Royal Family walking in procession behind the Land Rover which carried the duke's coffin. Mr Phillips married Canadian Autumn Kelly in 2008 and together they have two daughters, Savannah and Isla. Mr Phillips and his wife announced they were getting divorced in February 2020. Zara Tindall is the Princess Royal's daughter but, like her brother Peter Phillips, does not have a royal title, as they are descended from the female line. She followed her mother and father with a highly successful riding career - including winning a silver medal at the London 2012 Olympics. She married former England rugby player Mike Tindall in 2011 and the couple have three children. Their third child, born in March, is Lucas Philip Tindall. His middle name is reported to be a tribute to the duke and Mr Tindall's father Philip. Former England rugby player Mike Tindall joined the Royal Family when he married the Princess Royal's daughter Zara in 2011.

After helping to launch a Mexican-themed pub in Chelsea, co-founded by Harry's friend Guy Pelly, he got a job as a brand ambassador for a tequila manufacturer. Lady Louise Windsor is the elder child of the Earl and Countess of Wessex.

Prince Bernhard manages the family estates and the wineries in Germany. Prince Donatus represented the families of Prince Philip's two younger sisters, Sophie and Cecilie, who both married into the Hesse family. Princess Sophie spent time with the Queen and Prince Philip at Balmoral after their marriage, despite not being invited to the wedding because her husband was a German officer.

They are reported to have met on a film set in India, where he had a small part in the film Heat and Dust. The procession to St George's Chapel for the funeral service was led by the band of the Grenadier Guards. The band was followed by the Major General's party and military chiefs of staff, including the Chief of the Defence Staff General Sir Nicholas Carter, and First Sea Lord Admiral Tony Radakin. Admiral Radakin paid tribute to the duke's naval career, saying: ""He was one of us."" In procession behind the specially adapted Land Rover carrying Prince Philip's coffin were Princes Charles, Andrew, Edward and Princess Anne, as well as grandsons Princes William and Harry. They were joined by Princess Anne's son Peter Phillips, her husband Vice Admiral Sir Tim Laurence and the Earl of Snowdon. Members of the duke's staff followed behind them, including his private secretary Brigadier Archie Miller Bakewell, a personal protection officer, two pages and two valets. The mourners wore masks and were spaced far apart at the Quire end of the chapel, in line with coronavirus restrictions. The Queen travelled to the service with her lady-in-waiting Susan Hussey but inside she sat on her own, close to the altar. Next to her in the same row was Prince Andrew and directly opposite, across the Quire, sat Prince Charles with Camilla, Duchess of Cornwall. The Dean of Windsor, David Conner, conducted the funeral service and gave the commendation as the coffin was lowered into the royal vault. Others attending included a small choir of four singers. The choir, who were in the nave of the chapel, sang pieces of music chosen by the duke. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Justin Welby, gave the blessing at the end of the service.

"Top civil servant failed to declare another jobBill Crothers, who is embroiled in a row over working at Greensill, did not seek advice over another role.","Bill Crothers says he was ""transparent"" about the role he took on with Greensill Capital A former senior civil servant embroiled in a row over his job at Greensill Capital took another post without reporting it, it has emerged. Bill Crothers has come under fire for working at the now-failed finance firm while still on the government payroll. It has now come to light he took on another trustee role without seeking the advice of the necessary committee. Mr Crothers apologised to the Advisory Committee on Business Appointments for what he called an ""honest mistake"". But the chair of the committee, Lord Pickles, said he had breached government rules. The news comes after Lord Pickles warned the existing guidelines on ministers and top officials taking jobs with private firms needed urgent reforms as there did not appear to be ""any boundaries at all"" between civil servants and the private sector. Labour says things are becoming ""murkier"" and lobbyists have an ""open door"" to government. What jobs can ex-ministers do and what are the rules? Civil servants ordered to declare second jobs Top civil servant 'joined Greensill before quitting' What's the Greensill lobbying row about? The government has announced a review of contacts between top officials and ministers after the row over Greensill Capital, access, influence and lobbying has engulfed Westminster. The review will include former prime minister David Cameron's dealing with the firm, as well as Mr Crothers. It will be led by Nigel Boardman, a non-executive board member of the department for business. A number of Commons Select Committees have also announced their own inquiries. On Wednesday, Mr Johnson orderedConservative MPs to vote down Labour's callfor a ""full"" MP-led inquiry into Greensill and lobbying more widely. It emerged on Tuesday that Mr Crothers - a former government procurement officer - joined Greensill as an adviser in 2015 while still working as a civil servant, after getting the go-ahead from the Cabinet Office. But an exchange of letters between him and Lord Pickles, published on Thursday, also revealed he had failed to alert the committee about a different job he took in 2016 as a trustee with the Chartered Institute of Procurement and Supply Mr Crothers apologised in his letter for what he described an ""honest mistake"", saying he did not think he had to report the role as it was unpaid and with a not-for-profit charity. But Lord Pickles said the rules applied to both paid and unpaid jobs and it was therefore a breach of the regulations. This video can not be played Lord Pickles: ""I hope this doesn't sound rude, but there doesn't seem to have been any boundaries at all"" Earlier, the Tory peer Lord Pickles told the Commons public administration committee he had warned of a scandal but the Greensill lobbying affair was ""not where I expected it to come from"". He added: ""There is nothing wrong with lobbyists. What is wrong is with unregulated lobbying, secret lobbying - people getting an undue advantage. ""Our entire political careers have been built by lobbying of some sort. But where it becomes wrong is where it is not properly regulated and is transparent."" Speaking about Mr Crothers, Lord Pickles said it was not unusual for civil servants to have second jobs and to share their expertise. But he said the former civil servant's ""excuse"" when justifying his work with Greensill surprised him. ""It did seem, talking to other colleagues who had enjoyed being civil servants in the past, that they also shared my surprise - this seems to be a new thing, or a new excuse,"" he said. He said contractors and consultants to the government should have to sign a memorandum of understanding about the restrictions that would be placed on them after completing their public sector work. Lord Pickles also expressed his frustration that his committee had a ""very limited and defined role"", but added that most people do follow the rules and it is ""only a tiny minority"" who cause problems. This video can not be played Lobbying row: PM Johnson says we must ""get to the bottom of it"" Speaking on a visit to Dartmouth College in Devon, Boris Johnson said he agreed with Lord Pickles that reform was needed. The PM said: ""I think the most important thing is for us to get to the bottom of it properly and I want all ministers and civil servants to be making the information that needs to be known known to Mr Boardman and let's see what he has to say. ""We need to understand what's gone on here."" Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said more and stronger lobbying rules are needed because the current system ""is not working"". He said ministers were being lobbied for ""massive"" procurement contracts ""involving millions sometimes billions of pounds"". He added: ""Increasingly we're seeing a murkier and murkier picture whether it's the way contracts are handed out, the lack of due process or the lobbying which is not a revolving door, it's an open door now in to government"".
