Before we go, here's a quick look back at the highlights:  We'll be back tomorrow at 08:00GMT for Day 3. There will be more speeches from world leaders as well as a special focus on deforestation. We'll be looking out for an announcement of a new deal on forests - crucial to keeping global heating to 1.5C. Today's live coverage has been brought to you by Paul McLaren, George Bowden, Emma Harrison, Doug Faulkner, Gary Kitchener, James Clarke, Joseph Lee, Holly Honderich, George Wright, Robert Greenall and Kevin Ponniah. The BBC Climate Change Debate has ended. MÃºte Bourup Egede, prime minister of Greenland, finished the debate by saying he wanted to ""push all the countries - especially big countries with big economies - to collaborate with all of the countries in the world to invest in green energy"". ""This is for the future."" Reality Check Gina McCarthy, a climate adviser for the White House, said the US was âquadrupling its commitmentsâ on climate aid. In April, President Joe Biden said he would double funding to developing nations to tackle climate change. Then, in September at the UN General Assembly, he said he would âwork with the Congress to double that number againâ â quadrupling former President Obamaâs commitment. These figures are relative to Mr Obamaâs spending, not that of his immediate predecessor, because former President Donald Trump mostly withdrew from the USâs international commitments. But Mr Biden hasnât yet managed to pass his budget in Congress, which has the power to make laws. So that commitment is not set in stone yet. Read more about what the biggest polluters are doing to tackle climate change. Reality Check âOne of the things that government is trying to do is to incentivise through grants, the acquisition of these [electric] cars,â said Kwasi Kwarteng, UK Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. The UK government offers a grant of Â£2,500 to those looking to buy an electric car. However, the government has reduced the grant size over the past few years. The maximum grant started off at Â£5,000 in 2011, dropped to Â£4,500 in 2016, then Â£3,500 in 2018 and Â£3,000 in 2020 before being reduced to its current level. As well as the new reduced amount, the Department for Transport has also narrowed the eligibility criteria - restricting the grant for cars costing below Â£35,000. The move was heavily criticised by industry groups and car manufacturers who called it ""disappointing"". Read more about the move to electric cars. Colombia's Minister for Mining & Energy, Diego Mesa, says that there are still about 500,000 families in Colombia without access to electricity. ""We have one billion people around the world with no access to electricity who need to use wood to cook which impacts on deforestation â we have to fix that as well."" Reality Check Colombiaâs Minister of Energy and Mining, Diego Mesa, said carbon capture could help on the path to net zero. âThe problem is not the source of energy, the problem is emissions,"" he said. This is the idea that instead of drastically reducing the amount of carbon dioxide we emit, we could at least partially rely on technology to remove carbon dioxide thatâs already been emitted and store it or use it for energy. Some of these technologies do already exist but they would have to be scaled up enormously to make a dent â at great expense. Some of these processes themselves use a lot of energy to separate the carbon dioxide. And there are scientists who fear the promise of carbon capture technology might act as a âblank chequeâ for people to keep polluting at the same rate, in the so-far untested belief the damage can be reversed at some point in the future. Asked about the new Cambo oilfield to the west of the Shetland Islands, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng is booed as he says that the UK government will not rule out granting a licence for operations. He says he wonât shut the door on a quarter of a million jobs and that the climate change debate is about transition. ""It's a licence that was granted 20 years ago and it's a planning decision that we're going to examine. That's all I'm going to say about that,"" Kwarteng says, to loud boos. ""I can't simply say to the quarter of a million people who work in the sector in the UK that we're going to just close the door on the sector,"" he adds.  White House National Climate Advisor, Gina McCarthy, says that weâre being asked by young people to stop destroying the planet. President Biden is investing $550bn to grow the economy ""not to sacrifice it,"" she says. ""These are investments not penalties, and as soon as China and Brazil figure out that they are on the losing end of the proposition â theyâll be running to catch up."" Gina McCarthy is asked about criticism of President Joe Biden's huge motorcade at COP26. Kirsty Wark points out that the US motorcade was more than 80 vehicles long during a recent Biden visit to the Vatican. âWe have to make change but itâs going to take more than looking at whether or not its a big motorcade,"" McCarthy responds. More now from the BBC's Big Global Climate Debate, under way on BBC One. White House National Climate Advisor, Gina McCarthy, says that Russia and China should be at COP26. But she says that doesn't mean we should allow them to ""decide the fate of the world"". ""We should show them they are missing out if they do not join us and take action"" McCarthy says. ""I'm disappointed they are not here but they should not be allowed to dictate the lack of action. They canât dictate the lack of action. Science is telling us what to do and weâre here to get it done."" In the past half hour it's been confirmed that leaders from more than 100 countrieswill sign an agreement to end deforestation by 2030- providing funds to support and
restore forests. But what do experts think of the first major deal from COP26? Prof Simon Lewis at University College London, an expert in
climate and forests, says: âIt is good news
to have a political commitment to end deforestation from so many countries, and
significant funding to move forward on that journey."" ""That indigenous peoples are finally being acknowledged as key protectors of forests is particularly welcome, alongside additional funding for rainforest nations and obligations on consumer countries and companies to clean up their supply chains. Prof Simon Lewis, University College London He adds: âThe real weakness is a failure to tackle growing demand for products grown on rainforest land. But that would mean tackling high levels of meat consumption in places like the UK and US, and Boris Johnson has no appetite for that, so canât convene world leaders around that critical aspect of stopping deforestation.â And Chatham House Executive Director Sustainability and author of Rethinking the Amazonian Jungle, Ana Jung, called the announcement an important building block for COP26 success but says details will be key. The BBC's Big Global Climate Debate is now under way for viewers in the UK on BBC One, the iPlayer and by clicking the play button at the top of this page. We will be bringing you the biggest updates from the debate live here. Sitting on the panel are: A group of leaders at COP26 will sign the climate change conference's first major deal on Tuesday when they promise to stop deforestation by 2030. Signatories will include Brazil, where large parts of the Amazon rainforest have been cut down, and Indonesia, the world's largest exporter of palm oil. Felling trees contributes to climate change because it depletes forests that absorb vast amounts of the warming gas CO2. More money is also being promised to protect and restore forests.
More than 100 countries say they will sign the deal, covering about 85% of the world's forests. And governments of 28 countries will commit to remove deforestation from the global trade of food and other agricultural products such as palm oil, soya and cocoa. To stop deforestation and break the link between tree loss and agriculture, almost Â£14 billion ($19.2 billion) of public and private funding is being pledged. Some of this will go to developing countries to restore damaged land, tackle wildfire and support indigenous communities. Read morehere. We'll be bringing you coverage of the BBC Global Climate Debate - which begins at 22:35 GMT. Viewers in the UK can watch the programme on BBC One, the BBC iPlayer and by clicking the play button at the top of this page. A panel of leading international political figures has come together to take questions from young people in the studio in Glasgow - and around
the world - on the challenges presented by climate change. Presented by Kirsty Wark, the debate gives young people across the world the chance to hold their leaders to account
on action for climate change. Hilda Flavia Nakabuye, 24, is a climate change activist from Kampala, the Ugandan capital. Her activism was prompted by the impact of climate change on her family's lives, as she explains here: ""When I was still young I had a plantation with my family, but we lost it due to the effects of climate change. Heavy rains, floods, strong winds, unpredictable seasons, dry streams, all these things. ""In 2017 I joined a discussion at my school that was about climate change. I then understood that the effects my family were feeling was because of climate change. ""I started to speak up as a climate activist and as a campaigner. We travelled to schools and communities and in 2019 I started the Fridays For Future movement in Uganda. Now we have a network of 53,000. ""We were arrested a few times by the police because of the climate strikes - they alleged we might be a political party. ""I have very little hope in COP26 because I haven't seen any concrete actions being taken in the last 25 COPs. Many people are being under-represented, especially from the most affected countries, mostly from the global south. ""We are quickly losing our hope in the leaders because of their inaction. Our survival and the survival of the future generations depend on our actions today. ""Itâs either we come up with concrete actions or we fail all generations to come."" Reality Check Indiaâs Prime Minister Narendra Modi has long resisted setting a
date for his country to achieve net zero -  balancing out greenhouse gas emissions with measures to remove them from the
atmosphere. On Monday, he said India would now achieve this by 2070. This is a significantly longer timescale than the UK, EU and the US which have set targets of 2050 to reach this goal. It is also a decade later than Chinaâs 2060 target. Modi also said India would aim to supply 50% of all its
energy requirements from renewable sources by 2030 with a non-fossil fuel
generating capacity of 500 gigawatts (GW). India currently generates a
little over 100GW from non-fossil sources and is unlikely to hit an earlier target
of 175 gigawatts by 2022. Although India has expanded its
capacity to generate power from sources such as wind and solar, it still relies
heavily on coal. It currently powers about 70% of the countryâs electricity
grid. You can read morehereabout India's climate challenge. Prince Charles has been having a busy day at the COP26 summit and appeared to be in good spirits this evening as Boris Johnson praised his environmental efforts over the years. The Prince of Wales spoke to the assembled world leaders this afternoon before a visit to a distillery run by a former drug addict who had been helped by the Prince's Trust charity. Ryan Longmuir, who started Regis Banqueting 18 years ago after receiving a Â£5,000 loan from the charity, handed the prince a glass of whisky and said ""it's great meeting him"". Charles then joined other royals and some of the political leaders ata dinner reception at Glasgow's Kelvingrove Museum. The prince was again seen being handed a drink and this time, Reuters reports, he joked: ""I think I need it after today."" He may have been referring to a moment when he briefly lost his footing as he made his way to the stage to deliver this speech earlier in the day. But one man who apparently didn't think the prince had had a bad day was the UK prime minister. Our political editorLaura Kuenssberg has tweeted,externalthat Boris Johnson complimented the Prince of Wales at the reception, saying: âYou heard me earlier on say this was a job for James Bond. Well we have somebody who drives an electric Aston Martin who has a plan to defuse the ticking time bomb. ""l just want to say you're a prophet without honour and you've been right for a very long time."" Outgoing German Chancellor Angela Merkel said earlier that a comprehensive transformation in ways of working is needed to cut CO2 emissions - and not just action from governments. ""That's why I want to make a clear plea here for carbon pricing. This already exists within the EU and also in China, for example,"" she says. Carbon pricing - effectively a tax on CO2 emissions - has been called for in some industries,such as shipping, as a means of forcing polluting businesses to clean up their trade. Merkel said it would be a way to ensure industries and businesses had an incentive to develop technology that would be better for the global climate. That's a very clear expression of what we need to do in a decisive decade, she said. ""Then we will know how to best arrange CO2-free mobility, CO2-free industry and CO2-free processes of our life."" One of the ways we can reduce our carbon footprint is through what we eat. Switching to a plant-based diet can help fight climate change, according to a major report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),which says the West's high consumption of meat and dairy is fuelling global warming. If youâre eating beef three to five times a week, over an entire year your consumption is contributing 1,611kg to your annual greenhouse gas emissions. That's the equivalent of driving a regular petrol car 4,112 miles (6,618km), or taking five return flights from London to Malaga. Many are already taking note of this. Daily meat consumption in the UK has fallen by 17% in the past decade,a study has shown.

As the day draws to a close in Glasgow, US President Joe Biden says on Twitter that he hopes those present at the summit ""meet the moment on climate, and kick off a decade of ambition, action, and innovation to preserve our shared future"". ""There's no substitute for face-to-face diplomacy,"" he writes. Biden is among 25,000 delegates from about 200 countries - and from every region in the world - in Glasgow this week, gathered to share plans for how they will cut emissions by 2030. The much-anticipated United Nations gathering is one of the biggest summits the UK has ever hosted. Over two weeks, we can expect a flurry of announcements from countries promising to curb emissions, like switches to electric cars or an expedited phase-out of coal. By the end of the conference, some form of declaration is expected, with every country required to sign on. Â© 2025 BBC.

"World leaders promise to end deforestation by 2030In the first major deal from Glasgow's climate change meeting, leaders promise to stop cutting down trees.","Trees are often cut down to create grazing land to feed the world's hunger for meat More than 100 world leaders have promised to end and reverse deforestation by 2030, in the COP26 climate summit's first major deal. Brazil - where stretches of the Amazon rainforest have been cut down - was among the signatories on Tuesday. The pledge includes almost Â£14bn ($19.2bn) of public and private funds. Experts welcomed the move, but warned a previous deal in 2014 had ""failed to slow deforestation at all"" and commitments needed to be delivered on. Felling trees contributes to climate change because it depletes forests that absorb vast amounts of the warming gas CO2. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, who is hosting the global meeting in Glasgow, said ""more leaders than ever before"" - a total of 110 - had made the ""landmark"" commitment. ""We have to stop the devastating loss of our forests,"" he said - and ""end the role of humanity as nature's conqueror, and instead become nature's custodian"". The two-week summit in Glasgow is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Should there be limits on meat eating? And more questions 'We need water and there is water, but the wrong sort' Success or failure: Five people who get to decide The countries who have signed the pledge - including Canada, Brazil, Russia, China, Indonesia, the Democratic Republic of the Congo, the US and the UK(the full list is here),external- cover around 85% of the world's forests. Some of the funding will go to developing countries to restore damaged land, tackle wildfires and support indigenous communities. Governments of 28 countries also committed to remove deforestation from the global trade of food and other agricultural products such as palm oil, soya and cocoa. These industries drive forest loss by cutting down trees to make space for animals to graze or crops to grow. More than 30 of the world's biggest financial companies - including Aviva, Schroders and Axa - have also promised to end investment in activities linked to deforestation. And a Â£1.1bn fund will be established to protect the world's second largest tropical rainforest - in the Congo Basin. This video can not be played A logger, an environmental policeman, a cattle rancher and an environmentalist share their views on Amazon's future Prof Simon Lewis, an expert on climate and forests at University College London, said: ""It is good news to have a political commitment to end deforestation from so many countries, and significant funding to move forward on that journey."" But he told the BBC the world ""has been here before"" with a declaration in 2014 in New York ""which failed to slow deforestation at all"". There are reasons to be cheerful about the proposed plan to limit deforestation, specifically the scale of the funding, and the key countries that are supporting the pledge. It is also very positive that it will try to reinforce the role of indigenous people in protecting their trees. Studies have shown that protecting the rights of native communities is one of the best ways of saving forested lands. But there are significant challenges. Many previous plans haven't achieved their goals. In fact, deforestation has increased since a similar pledge was launched in 2014. There are often disputes between donors and recipients - Norway suspended funding for an Amazon fund in 2019 in an argument with Brazil's president. There are also major questions over how a major financial pledge could be effectively policed. How can funders verify that forests are actually being protected without spying from satellites or challenging national sovereignty in some way? And question marks also hang over a key plank of the new plan, which is to try to remove the link to deforestation from consumer goods sold in developed countries. One aspect is eating meat from animals, raised on imported soy grown on cleared lands. Will governments push companies and consumers to eat less meat to save the world's most important forests? Ecologist Dr Nigel Sizer called the agreement ""a big deal"" - but that some will find the target of 2030 disappointing. ""We're facing a climate emergency so giving ourselves another 10 years to address this problem doesn't quite seem consistent with that,"" said Dr Sizer, a former president of the Rainforest Alliance. ""But maybe this is realistic and the best that they can achieve."" The New York Declaration on Forests was a voluntary and legally non-binding agreement on deforestation in 2014 It aimed to half deforestation by 2020, and halt it by 2030 - and40 governments eventually signed up.,externalBut some key countries like Brazil and Russia weren't among them But the agreement failed,a report in 2019 found, saying deforestation was still continuing at an alarming rate The deal's signatories include a number of key countries. Indonesia is the world's largest exporter of palm oil, a product found in everything from shampoo to biscuits. Production is driving tree destruction and territory loss for indigenous people. Meanwhile, Russia's huge natural forests, with more than one fifth of the planet's trees,capture more than 1.5 billion tonnes of carbon annually.,external In the planet's biggest rainforest, the Amazon,deforestation accelerated to a 12-year high in 2020under Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. Asked whether leaders like Brazil's Mr Bolsonaro could be trusted to abide by the pledge, the UK's Environment Secretary George Eustice said ""we should be really positive when countries engage"". ""Last time there was an attempt at getting such a commitment on forests [in 2014], Brazil didn't take part, neither did Russia, neither did China. ""Brazil, they've really engaged with us on this agenda. It's a big step for them."" But pressed on whether the agreement will be enforceable, Mr Eustice said: ""It doesn't go as far into talking about enforcement mechanisms and so forth, that's not the nature of these agreements."" He said what was different about this pledge in particular is that there is ""the finance to back [it] up"". US President Joe Biden said he was ""confident"" the global pledge could be met, telling world leaders: ""All we need to do is summon the will and do what we know is right. We can do this."" He said the US would lead by example, and announced it would spend $9bn (Â£6.6bn) to conserve and restore forests. Climate change is one of the world's most pressing problems.Governments must promise more ambitious cuts in warming gases if we are to prevent greater global temperature rises. The summit in Glasgow is where change could happen.You need to watch for the promises made by the world's biggest polluters, like the US and China, and whether poorer countries are getting the support they need. All our lives will change.Decisions made here could impact our jobs, how we heat our homes, what we eat and how we travel. Read more about the COP26 summit here. Ana Yang, executive director at Chatham House Sustainability Accelerator, who co-wrotethe report Rethinking the Brazilian Amazon,external, said: ""This deal involves more countries, more players and more money. But the devil is in the detail which we still need to see."" But many people living in the Amazon, including in its urban areas, depend on the forest for their livelihoods and they need support in finding new incomes, she added. Prince Charles told COP26 delegates that nations had to ""honour"" the rights of indigenous people as they were ""experienced custodians"" of their habitats. And speaking to members of the Global Alliance of Territorial Communities - representing 24 countries with tropical rainforests - he said: ""We've got to work harder to save your forests, for all our sakes."" Tuntiak Katan, from the Coordination of Indigenous Communities of the Amazon Basin, welcomed the deal, saying that funds should be invested in supporting indigenous communities who are able to manage and protect forests. Mr Katan, an indigenous Shuar from Ecuador, told the BBC indigenous communities globally protected 80% of the world's biodiversity but faced threats and violence. ""For years we have protected our way of life and that has protected ecosystems and forests. Without us, no money or policy can stop climate change,"" he said. Tap or click to go through the gallery  One of the biggest causes of forest loss in Brazil is to grow soy beans, much of which goes to China and Europe for animal feed for pigs and chickens, said Dr Sizer. ""We all end up consuming that, unless we're strict vegetarians and we don't eat soy. It's a very serious problem that we're all connected with."" Trees are one of our major defences in a warming world. They suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, acting as so-called carbon sinks. They absorb around one third of global CO2 emitted each year. Under present targets, the world is on track for warming of 2.7C by 2100 - which the UN says would result in climate catastrophe. Currently an area of forest the size of 27 football pitches is lost every minute. How is the Amazon forest cleared? Depleted forests can also start to release CO2. If too many trees are cut down, scientists are worried that the planet will reach a tipping point that will set off abrupt and unpredictable climatic change. Also on the second day of the two-week climate summit: The UK and Indialaunched a fund to help small island states,externalto prepare themselves against climate change disasters. Mr Johnson said the difference between a 2C and 1.5 temperature rise would mean ""the difference between life and death"" for many people living there The US and EUare launching an initiative that aims to driveglobal efforts to cut emissions of methane Mr Johnson apologised to an Israeli ministerwho said she could not attend the summiton Monday because it was not wheelchair accessible The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

He said the US would lead by example, and announced it would spend $9bn (Â£6.6bn) to conserve and restore forests. Climate change is one of the world's most pressing problems.Governments must promise more ambitious cuts in warming gases if we are to prevent greater global temperature rises. The summit in Glasgow is where change could happen.You need to watch for the promises made by the world's biggest polluters, like the US and China, and whether poorer countries are getting the support they need. All our lives will change.Decisions made here could impact our jobs, how we heat our homes, what we eat and how we travel. Read more about the COP26 summit here. Ana Yang, executive director at Chatham House Sustainability Accelerator, who co-wrotethe report Rethinking the Brazilian Amazon,external, said: ""This deal involves more countries, more players and more money. But the devil is in the detail which we still need to see."" But many people living in the Amazon, including in its urban areas, depend on the forest for their livelihoods and they need support in finding new incomes, she added. Prince Charles told COP26 delegates that nations had to ""honour"" the rights of indigenous people as they were ""experienced custodians"" of their habitats. And speaking to members of the Global Alliance of Territorial Communities - representing 24 countries with tropical rainforests - he said: ""We've got to work harder to save your forests, for all our sakes."" Tuntiak Katan, from the Coordination of Indigenous Communities of the Amazon Basin, welcomed the deal, saying that funds should be invested in supporting indigenous communities who are able to manage and protect forests. Mr Katan, an indigenous Shuar from Ecuador, told the BBC indigenous communities globally protected 80% of the world's biodiversity but faced threats and violence. ""For years we have protected our way of life and that has protected ecosystems and forests. Without us, no money or policy can stop climate change,"" he said.

""We all end up consuming that, unless we're strict vegetarians and we don't eat soy. It's a very serious problem that we're all connected with."" Trees are one of our major defences in a warming world. They suck carbon dioxide out of the atmosphere, acting as so-called carbon sinks. They absorb around one third of global CO2 emitted each year. Under present targets, the world is on track for warming of 2.7C by 2100 - which the UN says would result in climate catastrophe. Currently an area of forest the size of 27 football pitches is lost every minute. How is the Amazon forest cleared? Depleted forests can also start to release CO2. If too many trees are cut down, scientists are worried that the planet will reach a tipping point that will set off abrupt and unpredictable climatic change. Also on the second day of the two-week climate summit: The UK and Indialaunched a fund to help small island states,externalto prepare themselves against climate change disasters. Mr Johnson said the difference between a 2C and 1.5 temperature rise would mean ""the difference between life and death"" for many people living there The US and EUare launching an initiative that aims to driveglobal efforts to cut emissions of methane Mr Johnson apologised to an Israeli ministerwho said she could not attend the summiton Monday because it was not wheelchair accessible The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control.

"Act now for our children, Queen urges leaders","This video can not be played ""The time for words has now moved to the time for action"" â watch the Queen's video message to world leaders The Queen has urged world leaders at the COP26 climate summit to ""achieve true statesmanship"" and create a ""safer, stabler future"" for the planet. In a video message, she said many people hoped the ""time for words has now moved to the time for action"". She urged them to act ""for our children and our children's children"" and ""rise above the politics of the moment"". The Queen added she took ""great pride"" in how her ""dear late husband"" Prince Philip promoted environmental issues. The 95-year-old monarch had been scheduled to attend the United Nations conference in Glasgow. But she pre-recorded her address last week at Windsor Castle after being advised to rest following medical checks. The Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge are both attending the COP26 conference, which is seen as a crucial gathering if temperature increases and climate changes are to be limited. LIVE: Latest updates from COP26 Royals join leaders at COP26 dinner reception Can COP26 really save the planet? What the COP26 climate summit could mean for us all Get serious on climate now or it's too late - PM In her address, the Queen recalled how the ""impact of the environment on human progress was a subject close to the heart"" of the Duke of Edinburgh. She referred to his warning at a 1969 academic gathering of the dangers of failing to address pollution. The Queen said: ""It is a source of great pride to me that the leading role my husband played in encouraging people to protect our fragile planet, lives on through the work of our eldest son Charles and his eldest son William. ""I could not be more proud of them."" Even though not there in person, this was a surprisingly personal message from the Queen. She mentions how the environment was a subject close to the heart of ""my dear late husband"" Prince Philip and says she ""could not be more proud"" that it was an interest sustained by her son Charles and grandson William. She also seems to make reference to her own mortality: ""None of us will live forever."" But there is also the authoritative voice of someone looking back after almost 70 years as head of state, telling world leaders to take the long view and ""rise above the politics of the moment"". The Queen says ""statesmanship"" means serving the future rather than short-term political rewards. She might be on the video screen but she was telling world leaders to focus on the big picture. The Queen said she also drew ""great comfort and inspiration from the relentless enthusiasm of people of all ages - especially the young - in calling for everyone to play their part"". She said: ""In the coming days, the world has the chance to join in the shared objective of creating a safer, stabler future for our people and for the planet on which we depend. ""None of us underestimates the challenges ahead: but history has shown that when nations come together in common cause, there is always room for hope."" In other developments at COP26: Thesummit's first dealwill see more than 100 countries including Brazil, Canada and Russia promise to stop deforestation by 2030 India pledges a net zero target for 2070- 20 years later than the summit target set by the UK NaturalistDavid Attenborough says carbon emissions must be halvedthis decade Boris Johnson addresses the conference,saying it ""must mark the beginning of the end"" of climate change Climate activist Greta Thunberg tells young protesterspoliticians are ""pretending to take our future seriously"" TheArchbishop of Canterbury apologisesfor comparing politicians who fail to act to those who ""ignored what was happening in Nazi Germany"" The Queen said she hoped the leaders at COP26 would ""rise above the politics of the moment, and achieve true statesmanship"". She added: ""It is the hope of many that the legacy of this summit - written in history books yet to be printed - will describe you as the leaders who did not pass up the opportunity; and that you answered the call of those future generations. ""That you left this conference as a community of nations with a determination, a desire, and a plan, to address the impact of climate change; and to recognise that the time for words has now moved to the time for action. ""Of course, the benefits of such actions will not be there to enjoy for all of us here today: we none of us will live forever. ""But we are doing this not for ourselves but for our children and our children's children, and those who will follow in their footsteps."" Ahead of COP26, theQueen was overheard appearing to suggest she was irritatedby people who ""talk"" but ""don't do"", when it comes to climate issues. Prince Charles told COP26 earlier that a ""war-like footing"" is needed to tackle the climate Addressing the opening of the conference earlier in the day, the Prince of Wales urged world leaders into action, saying he understood that many countries could not afford to ""go green"". Instead, he said, there needs to be a ""vast military-style campaign to marshal the strength of the global private sector"", which had trillions of dollars at its disposal. ""The scale and scope of the threat we face call for a global, systems-level solution, based on radically transforming our current fossil fuel-based economy to one that is genuinely renewable and sustainable,"" he said.

France delays sanctions as fishing talks continue,"France will delay retaliatory measures against the UK while talks over post-Brexit fishing rights continue, Emmanuel Macron has said. France had threatened to stop British boats offloading catches at its ports from midnight over the row. But the French president told reporters the sanctions would be put off as talks between officials continued. Environment Secretary George Eustice said there had been a ""big de-escalation"" of the row. There had been ""constructive talks"" with France on Monday, he added. ""We very much welcome the fact that France has decided not to go ahead with its threats and we'll continue to have those constructive discussions."" Who really owns UK fishing rights? UK boat held by French, despite minster's claim What does the Brexit deal mean for fishing? Brexit minister Lord Frost will meet France's European affairs minister ClÃ©ment Beaune on Thursday to discuss a range of Brexit issues. The French government said its measures would now not come into effect before this meeting took place. In a statement, the president's office added that it expected the UK to respond to France's latest proposals on licensing by Wednesday. The row flared up last month, after the UK and Jersey denied permits to dozens of French boats to operate in waters near their coastline. France had threatened to take a series of measures against the UK unless more licences were granted by midnight on Monday into Tuesday. Representatives from the EU Commission, France, the UK and the Channel Islands began talks on Monday, seeking to defuse the row. French media quoted Mr Macron telling reporters at the COP26 climate summit in Glasgow these would now continue on Tuesday. ""It's not while we're negotiating that we're going to impose sanctions,"" he was quoted as saying. ""We'll see where we are tomorrow [Tuesday] at the end of the day, to see if things have really changed,"" he added. Under the Brexit trade deal, the EU and UK agreed they would give licences to boats if they can show they have fished in each other's waters for years. But there have been disagreements about how much evidence is needed, leading to anger from France when applications were denied by the UK and Jersey. Big trawlers will routinely collect this sort of information using things like data from Automatic Identification Systems. Smaller vessels that come from French harbours to fish around the Channel Islands, for example, would find it harder to provide this kind of proof. Read more about post-Brexit fishing rules The retaliatory measures threatened by France include preventing British fishing boats from offloading catches at its ports, and stepping up border checks on UK goods. Officials in Paris have also threatened to tighten security checks on British boats, and increase checks on trucks going to and from the UK. Last week, aBritish trawler was seized by Francewhile fishing in French waters. Mr Eustice told the BBC there had been some ""administrative confusion"" but that he did not think the vessel was still being held by the French. But Macduff Shellfish, the owners of the seized Cornelis Gert Jan have told the BBC they are ""not aware"" that their trawler has been released by French authorities. Andrew Brown, the company's director of sustainability and public affairs, said: ""Right now we are tied up seeking to secure the release of the vessel.  We are not aware that the vessel has been released.  Our understanding is that the vessel remains held at Le Havre at least until the hearing takes place tomorrow (Wednesday)."" Sources at the environment department have told the BBC that contrary to Mr Eustice's previous assertion, the British fishing boat is still impounded by the French authorities in Le Havre. They add that the boat's impoundment is seen as a ""routine enforcement action"" by the French and is not connected to the wider fishing row, so is unlikely to be raised as part of negotiations on licences. For some, it seems, President Macron could never have won. Pressing ahead with trade disruptions over ""a few dozen"" fishing licences risked looking stroppy. Backing down has been seen by some UK figures - and French fishermen - as capitulation. Of course, this row isn't just about fishing licences.  And a wider lack of trust between French and British politicians is feeding the fire. In France, the deadlock is often explained by Boris Johnson's wish to blame someone else for the impact of Brexit. If the French are disrupting trade, the argument goes, any problems can be blamed on them. In the UK, Emmanuel Macron - irritated by Britain's behaviour and months ahead of a presidential race - is seen as vindictive, needing to prove to his own electorate that leaving the EU is a mistake. The UK government has said it welcomes the new round of discussions, saying it's ""ready to consider any new evidence"" to support the remaining licence applications.  In other words: its core position on issuing licences hasn't changed. The two men who will meet in Paris on Thursday - France's Europe Minister ClÃ©ment Beaune, and Britain's Brexit Minister, David Frost - have been among the most outspoken critics on either side. Mr Beaune said last week that the UK only understood ""the language of force"". Threats are one thing, but a real escalation could get messy for both sides. Will the language of diplomacy work any better now? Barrie Deas, the chief executive of the National Federation of Fishermen's Organisations, said it was important that licences ""aren't just handed out like confetti"" to EU vessels. He told BBC Breakfast there needed to be a way found to identify the vessels that had historically fished in the waters. ""I think it's the intervention of probably domestic politics in France that have escalated this out of all recognition from a fisheries issue."" Speaking earlier, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss accused France of ""unfairly"" setting a deadline for issuing more fishing permits. She rejected a French accusation that the UK had breached the Brexit trade deal over the way it had issued licences. And she had warned the UK would be prepared to take legal action under the deal, unless France withdrew its threats. Emilie Devogel, who sells fish in Boulogne-sur-Mer that are caught by her husband JÃ©rÃ©my, told the BBC some of the fishermen are getting worried. ""We are starting to lose hope. We only want, while respecting fish resources, to be able to work just like before. ""It's very tense. We don't know any more where we stand and on top of that, some boats have licences, others don't, it creates conflicts."" Speaking to the BBC on Monday, Matt, a fisherman from Dover, said: ""We're only asking them [the French] that if they are going to fish in our waters to abide by the same rules and produce evidence to say they have been fishing in our waters. ""We have been completely fair, completely open and completely honest - the French are acting very irresponsibly."" Who really owns UK fishing rights?

What action are the biggest carbon polluters taking?,"Just four countries plus the European Union are responsible for most of the world's emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is the most common greenhouse gas responsible for global warming. All five signed up tothe Paris agreementin 2015 to cut emissions to limit global temperature rises. What steps have they taken since? Says carbon emissions will peak before 2030 Aiming for 25% of energy from non-fossil fuels by 2030 Promises to be carbon neutral before 2060 Carbon neutrality refers to the balancing of overall carbon emissions with measures to absorb it from the atmosphere such as the planting of trees. China is the largest producer of CO2, and its carbon emissions are still rising, largely because of a reliance on coal. Last month, President Xi Jinping announced it wouldstop funding new coal-fired projects overseas. But at home, coal mines have been ordered to ramp up production to meet surging energy demand, although Beijing has promised to cut back on coal use from 2026. China now accounts for more than a third of all global solar power and is the world's biggest producer of wind energy. But it needs to cut demand for coal by more than 80% by 2060 to meet its climate goals, according to the International Energy Agency. Climate Action Tracker,externalsays it's not clear if its net zero plan is for just CO2 or all greenhouse gases. And it rates its policies and actions as ""insufficient,"" and not consistent with the Paris Agreement goal of keeping to a 1.5C increase in global temperatures. China has not joined a pledge made at the climate summit by more than 100 countries to reduce emissions of another greenhouse gas, methane, by 30% by 2030. However, in ajoint action plan with the United States, China has promised to develop a ""National Action Plan"" to address the issue of methane emissions. Will cut CO2 by at least 50% of 2005 level by 2030 Wants half of new vehicles to be electric by 2030 Promises to be carbon neutral by 2050 More than 80% of US energy comes from fossil fuels, although renewable energy sources are on the increase. President Joe Biden's environmental plan looks to expand green energy further, with a $150bn (Â£100bn) clean-electricity programme to reward utility companies switching from fossil fuels. The US has also pledged ""100% carbon pollution-free"" electricity by 2035 - a commitment made in its joint statement with China at the COP26 summit. CO2 emissions have been dropping over the past decade. But Climate Action Tracker says US actions and policies are ""insufficient"", and need ""substantial improvement"" to beconsistent with the Paris Agreement.,external Promises a 55% emissions cut from the 1990 level by 2030 Aiming for 40% of energy from renewables by 2030 Will be carbon neutral by 2050 The top CO2 emitters in the EU are Germany, Italy and Poland. And while it has overall emissions targets, EU states have differing financial and technical capabilities. But all member countries need to agree how they reach the bloc's targets, as the EU negotiates as a single entity when it comes to the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (Cop26). Climate Action Tracker says its policies and actions are ""almost sufficient"" to keep the global temperature rise to less than 2C, noting emissions have been falling since 2018. Aiming for a 45% reduction in 'emissions intensity' by 2030 Promises 50% of electricity capacity from non-fossil fuels by 2030 Pledging to reach net zero by 2070 India's annual CO2 emissions have risen steadily in the past two decades - but it produces the lowest emissions per person among the top five. India has argued the wealthier, more industrialised nations should bear more of the burden, as they have contributed far more to global warming over time. It has a target for cutting ""emissions intensity"" - CO2 per unit of economic growth - saying this is a fairer way to compare with other countries. India has announced a target date for net zero of 2070 - later than other major emitters. It has also promised a significant increase in energy production from non-fossil fuel sources such as wind, solar and hydro power - and by 2019, this had reached 23%. Butabout 70% of India's electricity grid is powered by coal,external. And India has not joined the methane emissions reduction initiative unveiled at COP26. Climate Action Tracker says the country needs to phase out coal power generation before 2040 and boost its target for energy derived from non-fossil fuels. India is also a major methane emitter, but it has not joined the global pledge to cut emissions by 2030. Will cut emissions by 30% from 1990 levels by 2030 Promises to be carbon neutral by 2060 After the collapse of the Soviet Union, in 1991, Russia's economy - and its carbon emissions - shrank anyway. But Russia is still relying on its extensive forests and swamps to absorb carbon. Climate Action Tracker notes that for the COP26 conference,Russia had not updated its targets since the 2015 Paris Agreement.,external Non-fossil fuel sources make up only a small proportion of its total energy mix. It's also a major emitter of methane, but has not joined in the emissions cut pledge made at the climate summit.

Before we go, here's a quick look back at the highlights:  We'll be back tomorrow at 08:00GMT for Day 3. There will be more speeches from world leaders as well as a special focus on deforestation. We'll be looking out for an announcement of a new deal on forests - crucial to keeping global heating to 1.5C. Today's live coverage has been brought to you by Paul McLaren, George Bowden, Emma Harrison, Doug Faulkner, Gary Kitchener, James Clarke, Joseph Lee, Holly Honderich, George Wright, Robert Greenall and Kevin Ponniah. The BBC Climate Change Debate has ended. MÃºte Bourup Egede, prime minister of Greenland, finished the debate by saying he wanted to ""push all the countries - especially big countries with big economies - to collaborate with all of the countries in the world to invest in green energy"". ""This is for the future."" Reality Check Gina McCarthy, a climate adviser for the White House, said the US was âquadrupling its commitmentsâ on climate aid. In April, President Joe Biden said he would double funding to developing nations to tackle climate change. Then, in September at the UN General Assembly, he said he would âwork with the Congress to double that number againâ â quadrupling former President Obamaâs commitment. These figures are relative to Mr Obamaâs spending, not that of his immediate predecessor, because former President Donald Trump mostly withdrew from the USâs international commitments. But Mr Biden hasnât yet managed to pass his budget in Congress, which has the power to make laws. So that commitment is not set in stone yet. Read more about what the biggest polluters are doing to tackle climate change. Reality Check âOne of the things that government is trying to do is to incentivise through grants, the acquisition of these [electric] cars,â said Kwasi Kwarteng, UK Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. The UK government offers a grant of Â£2,500 to those looking to buy an electric car. However, the government has reduced the grant size over the past few years. The maximum grant started off at Â£5,000 in 2011, dropped to Â£4,500 in 2016, then Â£3,500 in 2018 and Â£3,000 in 2020 before being reduced to its current level. As well as the new reduced amount, the Department for Transport has also narrowed the eligibility criteria - restricting the grant for cars costing below Â£35,000. The move was heavily criticised by industry groups and car manufacturers who called it ""disappointing"". Read more about the move to electric cars. Colombia's Minister for Mining & Energy, Diego Mesa, says that there are still about 500,000 families in Colombia without access to electricity. ""We have one billion people around the world with no access to electricity who need to use wood to cook which impacts on deforestation â we have to fix that as well."" Reality Check Colombiaâs Minister of Energy and Mining, Diego Mesa, said carbon capture could help on the path to net zero. âThe problem is not the source of energy, the problem is emissions,"" he said. This is the idea that instead of drastically reducing the amount of carbon dioxide we emit, we could at least partially rely on technology to remove carbon dioxide thatâs already been emitted and store it or use it for energy. Some of these technologies do already exist but they would have to be scaled up enormously to make a dent â at great expense. Some of these processes themselves use a lot of energy to separate the carbon dioxide. And there are scientists who fear the promise of carbon capture technology might act as a âblank chequeâ for people to keep polluting at the same rate, in the so-far untested belief the damage can be reversed at some point in the future. Asked about the new Cambo oilfield to the west of the Shetland Islands, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng is booed as he says that the UK government will not rule out granting a licence for operations. He says he wonât shut the door on a quarter of a million jobs and that the climate change debate is about transition. ""It's a licence that was granted 20 years ago and it's a planning decision that we're going to examine. That's all I'm going to say about that,"" Kwarteng says, to loud boos. ""I can't simply say to the quarter of a million people who work in the sector in the UK that we're going to just close the door on the sector,"" he adds.  White House National Climate Advisor, Gina McCarthy, says that weâre being asked by young people to stop destroying the planet. President Biden is investing $550bn to grow the economy ""not to sacrifice it,"" she says. ""These are investments not penalties, and as soon as China and Brazil figure out that they are on the losing end of the proposition â theyâll be running to catch up."" Gina McCarthy is asked about criticism of President Joe Biden's huge motorcade at COP26. Kirsty Wark points out that the US motorcade was more than 80 vehicles long during a recent Biden visit to the Vatican. âWe have to make change but itâs going to take more than looking at whether or not its a big motorcade,"" McCarthy responds. More now from the BBC's Big Global Climate Debate, under way on BBC One. White House National Climate Advisor, Gina McCarthy, says that Russia and China should be at COP26. But she says that doesn't mean we should allow them to ""decide the fate of the world"". ""We should show them they are missing out if they do not join us and take action"" McCarthy says. ""I'm disappointed they are not here but they should not be allowed to dictate the lack of action. They canât dictate the lack of action. Science is telling us what to do and weâre here to get it done."" In the past half hour it's been confirmed that leaders from more than 100 countrieswill sign an agreement to end deforestation by 2030- providing funds to support and
restore forests. But what do experts think of the first major deal from COP26? Prof Simon Lewis at University College London, an expert in
climate and forests, says: âIt is good news
to have a political commitment to end deforestation from so many countries, and
significant funding to move forward on that journey."" ""That indigenous peoples are finally being acknowledged as key protectors of forests is particularly welcome, alongside additional funding for rainforest nations and obligations on consumer countries and companies to clean up their supply chains. Prof Simon Lewis, University College London He adds: âThe real weakness is a failure to tackle growing demand for products grown on rainforest land. But that would mean tackling high levels of meat consumption in places like the UK and US, and Boris Johnson has no appetite for that, so canât convene world leaders around that critical aspect of stopping deforestation.â And Chatham House Executive Director Sustainability and author of Rethinking the Amazonian Jungle, Ana Jung, called the announcement an important building block for COP26 success but says details will be key. The BBC's Big Global Climate Debate is now under way for viewers in the UK on BBC One, the iPlayer and by clicking the play button at the top of this page. We will be bringing you the biggest updates from the debate live here. Sitting on the panel are: A group of leaders at COP26 will sign the climate change conference's first major deal on Tuesday when they promise to stop deforestation by 2030. Signatories will include Brazil, where large parts of the Amazon rainforest have been cut down, and Indonesia, the world's largest exporter of palm oil. Felling trees contributes to climate change because it depletes forests that absorb vast amounts of the warming gas CO2. More money is also being promised to protect and restore forests.
More than 100 countries say they will sign the deal, covering about 85% of the world's forests. And governments of 28 countries will commit to remove deforestation from the global trade of food and other agricultural products such as palm oil, soya and cocoa. To stop deforestation and break the link between tree loss and agriculture, almost Â£14 billion ($19.2 billion) of public and private funding is being pledged. Some of this will go to developing countries to restore damaged land, tackle wildfire and support indigenous communities. Read morehere.

A panel of leading international political figures has come together to take questions from young people in the studio in Glasgow - and around
the world - on the challenges presented by climate change. Presented by Kirsty Wark, the debate gives young people across the world the chance to hold their leaders to account
on action for climate change. Hilda Flavia Nakabuye, 24, is a climate change activist from Kampala, the Ugandan capital. Her activism was prompted by the impact of climate change on her family's lives, as she explains here: ""When I was still young I had a plantation with my family, but we lost it due to the effects of climate change. Heavy rains, floods, strong winds, unpredictable seasons, dry streams, all these things. ""In 2017 I joined a discussion at my school that was about climate change. I then understood that the effects my family were feeling was because of climate change. ""I started to speak up as a climate activist and as a campaigner. We travelled to schools and communities and in 2019 I started the Fridays For Future movement in Uganda. Now we have a network of 53,000. ""We were arrested a few times by the police because of the climate strikes - they alleged we might be a political party. ""I have very little hope in COP26 because I haven't seen any concrete actions being taken in the last 25 COPs. Many people are being under-represented, especially from the most affected countries, mostly from the global south. ""We are quickly losing our hope in the leaders because of their inaction. Our survival and the survival of the future generations depend on our actions today. ""Itâs either we come up with concrete actions or we fail all generations to come."" Reality Check Indiaâs Prime Minister Narendra Modi has long resisted setting a
date for his country to achieve net zero -  balancing out greenhouse gas emissions with measures to remove them from the
atmosphere. On Monday, he said India would now achieve this by 2070. This is a significantly longer timescale than the UK, EU and the US which have set targets of 2050 to reach this goal. It is also a decade later than Chinaâs 2060 target. Modi also said India would aim to supply 50% of all its
energy requirements from renewable sources by 2030 with a non-fossil fuel
generating capacity of 500 gigawatts (GW). India currently generates a
little over 100GW from non-fossil sources and is unlikely to hit an earlier target
of 175 gigawatts by 2022. Although India has expanded its
capacity to generate power from sources such as wind and solar, it still relies
heavily on coal. It currently powers about 70% of the countryâs electricity
grid. You can read morehereabout India's climate challenge. Prince Charles has been having a busy day at the COP26 summit and appeared to be in good spirits this evening as Boris Johnson praised his environmental efforts over the years. The Prince of Wales spoke to the assembled world leaders this afternoon before a visit to a distillery run by a former drug addict who had been helped by the Prince's Trust charity. Ryan Longmuir, who started Regis Banqueting 18 years ago after receiving a Â£5,000 loan from the charity, handed the prince a glass of whisky and said ""it's great meeting him"". Charles then joined other royals and some of the political leaders ata dinner reception at Glasgow's Kelvingrove Museum. The prince was again seen being handed a drink and this time, Reuters reports, he joked: ""I think I need it after today."" He may have been referring to a moment when he briefly lost his footing as he made his way to the stage to deliver this speech earlier in the day. But one man who apparently didn't think the prince had had a bad day was the UK prime minister. Our political editorLaura Kuenssberg has tweeted,externalthat Boris Johnson complimented the Prince of Wales at the reception, saying: âYou heard me earlier on say this was a job for James Bond. Well we have somebody who drives an electric Aston Martin who has a plan to defuse the ticking time bomb. ""l just want to say you're a prophet without honour and you've been right for a very long time."" Outgoing German Chancellor Angela Merkel said earlier that a comprehensive transformation in ways of working is needed to cut CO2 emissions - and not just action from governments. ""That's why I want to make a clear plea here for carbon pricing. This already exists within the EU and also in China, for example,"" she says. Carbon pricing - effectively a tax on CO2 emissions - has been called for in some industries,such as shipping, as a means of forcing polluting businesses to clean up their trade. Merkel said it would be a way to ensure industries and businesses had an incentive to develop technology that would be better for the global climate. That's a very clear expression of what we need to do in a decisive decade, she said. ""Then we will know how to best arrange CO2-free mobility, CO2-free industry and CO2-free processes of our life."" One of the ways we can reduce our carbon footprint is through what we eat. Switching to a plant-based diet can help fight climate change, according to a major report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),which says the West's high consumption of meat and dairy is fuelling global warming. If youâre eating beef three to five times a week, over an entire year your consumption is contributing 1,611kg to your annual greenhouse gas emissions. That's the equivalent of driving a regular petrol car 4,112 miles (6,618km), or taking five return flights from London to Malaga. Many are already taking note of this. Daily meat consumption in the UK has fallen by 17% in the past decade,a study has shown.

As the day draws to a close in Glasgow, US President Joe Biden says on Twitter that he hopes those present at the summit ""meet the moment on climate, and kick off a decade of ambition, action, and innovation to preserve our shared future"". ""There's no substitute for face-to-face diplomacy,"" he writes. Biden is among 25,000 delegates from about 200 countries - and from every region in the world - in Glasgow this week, gathered to share plans for how they will cut emissions by 2030. The much-anticipated United Nations gathering is one of the biggest summits the UK has ever hosted. Over two weeks, we can expect a flurry of announcements from countries promising to curb emissions, like switches to electric cars or an expedited phase-out of coal. By the end of the conference, some form of declaration is expected, with every country required to sign on. Â© 2025 BBC.

Is Greta Thunberg right about UK climate figures?,"The climate activist Greta Thunberg has claimed the UK overstates how much it has reduced greenhouse gas emissions. The government saysannual emissions have fallen by 44% since 1990,external. But she told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme: ""For example the UK, one popular thing to say is that you have reduced your emissions by 44% since 1990, and of course that sounds good... but if you look at the actual emissions that's not the case."" So who is right? It all depends on what you count as a country's emissions. The UK's 44% reduction refers to 'territorial emissions'. These measure what happens within a country's borders - including things such as heating and powering homes, transport, domestic industry and agriculture. But they exclude emissions from international aviation, shipping and imports. The UK is not unique in producing its figures like this, though. Each year, countries that are signed upto an international agreement called the Kyoto Protocol,externalsubmit their overall emissions figures to the UN. That reporting is all done on a territorial basis - so they all exclude international aviation, shipping and imports. Miss Thunberg has also criticised other countries for using these same methods. The UK's Department for Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Defra), produces figures on ""consumption emissions"" - a measure based on everything the UK uses, including imports. These take into account emissions associated with producing goods overseas (in places such as China) which the UK then imports. They also include emissions from international aviation and shipping. These are not used by the government as official figures though. Greta Thunberg joined a climate protest in London before Cop26 On this measure, Defra estimated the UK's overall carbon footprint in2018 was about 26% lower than in 1997,external, when it first published these figures. The WWF - a non-governmental organisation focused on the environment - has factored in 'consumption emissions' dating back to 1990, and estimates thatup until 2016, UK emissions declined by 15%.,external The UK says its target of reaching net zero emissions by 2050will factor in both aviation and shipping,externalfollowing pressure from campaigners. In her interview, Greta Thunberg also highlighted the burning of biomass in the UK, suggesting it was excluded from the government's territorial emissions. Greta Thunberg: Who is the climate campaigner and what are her aims? Climate change: Is the UK on track to meet its targets? Burning biomass such as wood and other organic materialsis playing an increasing role,externalin the UK's electricity supply, accounting for about 12% of it last year. The biomass grown and burnt here would be counted as part of the UK's territorial emissions, but any brought in from overseas would not be. Large amounts of biomass burnt in the UK comes from the US and Canada - and critics argue that importing it from abroad is not sustainable due to the emissions associated with its transport. UK government research,externalhas shown that emissions from the electricity generated from biomass can be higher than those from fossil fuels, depending on factors such as the type of biomass and where it comes from. Wood pellets from the US and Canada are burnt as biomass in the UK 'Consumption emissions' figures - based on everything the UK uses - can be less accurate because tracking the total use of emissions through complex global supply chains is very difficult. It can lead to some double-counting, although no country currently counts international aviation and shipping in their territorial emissions, so double-counting wouldn't happen from these two sources. Using 'consumption emissions' also means countries are measuring things they do not always control. For example, if the UK imports products from China and then China starts making things in a more carbon-intensive way, the UK's consumption emissions would go up, despite consuming the same amount. 'Territorial emissions' can be a clearer measure of how the government is acting to tackle emissions at home. There are continuing debates about how responsibility for the emissions associated with global supply chains should be shared out between countries, particularly as many developing countries are responsible for manufacturing things then used in more developed countries. This piece was originally published in April 2019 and was based on a similar claim by Greta Thunberg about UK emissions. It has been updated with the latest figures, the government's announcement on shipping and aviation emissions and Miss Thunberg's comments on biomass.

"The challenges that COP26 needs to tackle'I was nervous. Breathe I said. I looked up to see Biden'A really simple guide to climate changeAct now for our children, Queen urges leaders","World leaders are arriving in Glasgow for the COP26 climate summit, where they will be asked to make ambitious cuts in warming gases to prevent further global temperature rises. As negotiators prepare for two intense weeks of talking, here are five major challenges that have to be overcome. Forget talk of temperature rises or dirty coal. The real challenge facing negotiators at this key conference is the issue of trust, or the lack of it. The key relationships that led to success at the major climate conference in Paris in 2015 have all taken a battering. The US and China came together then to reach agreement. After four years of Donald Trump and increasing rivalry, the two countries now eye each other with deep suspicion. Climate change is one of the world's most pressing problems.Governments must promise more ambitious cuts in warming gases if we are to prevent greater global temperature rises. The summit in Glasgow is where change could happen.You need to watch for the promises made by the world's biggest polluters, like the US and China, and whether poorer countries are getting the support they need. All our lives will change.Decisions made here could impact our jobs, how we heat our homes, what we eat and how we travel. Read more about the COP26 summit here. Four numbers to better understand COP26 The so-called ""high ambition coalition"" of island states, developing economies and the EU that really pushed things forward in France in 2015, is now not the force it was. On top of all that, there's also money problems: The failure of the international community to make good on the delivery of a long-promised $100bn to help poorer countries cope with climate change has gone down badly. However you dress it up, it has dented trust at a critical time. Speaking at the G20 meeting in Rome just before flying to Glasgow for the COP, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres underlined just how important the question of trust was. ""If we want real success, and not just a mirage, we need more ambition and more action,"" he said. ""That will only be possible with a massive mobilization of political will. And that requires trust among the key actors."" ""Today, trust is in short supply. There are serious questions of credibility."" Unless this deficit is overcome, Glasgow is likely to fall well short. Key to any success in Glasgow has to be the credibility of the host nation. France is generally seen as setting the bar for what a successful presidency looks like, when it hosted the Paris COP in 2015. UK minister Alok Sharma will be in charge of the negotiations for COP26 The UK faces some challenges in this area, though it has some credit in the bank too. ""The UK has led from the front for many years,"" said Kaveh Guilanpour, a long-time climate negotiator and now with the Centre for Climate and Energy Solutions. The government's strong commitment to the Paris goal of achieving net zero by 2050 - that is, to not add any more carbon emissions to the atmosphere than it can remove - creates credibility, he says. However, on the other side of the ledger, the UK government has run into trouble over plans for a coal mine in Cumbria, and by announcing cuts to air passenger duty just last week. Of even more importance perhaps isthe cut to Overseas Development Aid(ODA), which saw that UK's annual support reduced from 0.7% of national income to 0.5%. ""Boris Johnson and his Cabinet have undoubtedly made life additionally difficult for themselves,"" said Richard Black, a senior associate at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit. One of the biggest challenges for this COP is the sheer volume of work. The postponement of last year's meeting due to Covid is one cause, but it's also because efforts to carry out the negotiations virtually haven't worked. Delegates were happy to talk, but refused to take decisions until they met face to face. So Glasgow has a huge agenda, particularly on the question of financing how countries deal with climate change. Negotiators asleep as talks drag through the night in Copenhagen COP15 in 2009 There are also complex details about how the Paris agreement should be implemented that still haven't been resolved. Questions on transparency, carbon markets, and having the same timeframes for cutting carbon emissions, have defied the best efforts of negotiators in the six years since Paris. ""There is a real risk that failure on a relatively small issue at the end of the second week could be the headline,"" said Mr Guilanpour. ""The huge backlog means there are highly controversial items that could cause delays with serious consequences for getting all the work done."" There is a growing sense among many participants that this UN negotiating process is no longer fit for purpose. The need for consensus from 197 parties, and the legalistic and technical nature of the talks, means there is, in reality, very little room for actual negotiations. For this summit, the UK has been determined to bring in real world examples of success to show that fighting climate change can be good for the planet and good for business. The UK is also eager to conclude a series of side deals on questions like deforestation, on methane, on coal and on protecting nature - it believes that the COP needs to be seen as not just a dull talking shop, but a space to highlight best practice and encourage action. This video can not be played Watch how three Kuwaitis cope in their country's ""unbearable"" heat Some participants believe the climate crisis is now so serious they want to see real reform of the COP to bring in carrots and sticks for countries to meet their pledges. ""There has to be an accountability factor, because otherwise, countries can pledge anything and can promise anything,"" says Dr Deborah Brosnan, who's advising the Antigua and Barbuda team here. For months, politicians, negotiators and journalists have been arguing over what success at this conference looks like. This isn't Paris in 2015 or Copenhagen in 2009, where deal/no deal made it very easy to tell if it was thumbs up or down. The UK's stated aim to ""keep 1.5C alive"" - referring to the limit to the annual rise in average temperatures, compared to pre-industrial times. It is a handy sound bite that belies the massive shift in ambition required to achieve it. Look a little closer and what the UK actually means is that it wants to deliver a ""roadmap"" (odd choice of word) that will essentially mean that all countries revise their carbon cutting targets in the very short term, not every five years as is currently the case. Alternatively, and more likely, the COP might finish with a bun-fight where developing countries reject any attempt to get them to come back with improved offers in a year or three. The UK might be left with a wishy-washy political declaration that aspires to more but doesn't commit anyone to actually do anything. And all the extra commitments on issues like cutting methane emissions, shipping emissions and so on, might be an unenforceable wish list, dressed up to impress. Once the final gavel comes down, expect a head-turning flurry of spin from the UK and others to convince the world that Glasgow has really delivered. ""Briefings go directly from the political leader's office to political journalists who rarely have any background in the UN climate process,"" said Richard Black, who is also a former BBC environment correspondent. ""News coverage often focuses on political theatre rather than the actual issues. Rhetorical leadership gets mistaken for the real thing."" But keep the central question in mind. Is the prospect of keeping the world under 1.5C of warming now more likely? ""If there's a golden rule to cutting through the spin, it's to try and understand the issues, and look at what leaders do, not at what they say,"" said Mr Black.

"'I was nervous. Breathe I said. I looked up to see Biden'A really simple guide to climate changeAct now for our children, Queen urges leaders","Samoan climate activist Brianna Fruean, 23, addressed world leaders at the opening of COP26. In the first of a series of first-person accounts from the Glasgow summit, she describes what it felt like to speak up for Pacific islanders - whose homes and way of life are under threat from rising sea levels. I woke up early, about 06:00. And I thought: ""Today's finally the day."" I'd spent a couple of days working on my speech - writing it out, making cuts. I felt immense pressure to represent the Pacific well. Due to uncertainty around Covid, so few Pacific delegates have been able to get to the UK. And with all the quarantine rules - you need to go via New Zealand to get to Samoa - I left not knowing when I might be able to go back. I remember, at primary school, my teacher telling my class that climate change could mean small islands like Samoa, Tutuila and Tonga might drown. I just thought, ""I'm not going to let my islands drown."" So I set up an environmental group at school. I started a chapter of the global climate movement - 350.org. I was the youngest co-ordinator at the time, at 11 years old. Today it was a bit chaotic getting into the summit. But I hope that the reason it was so chaotic was because there's heaps of people here who care. I wear a flower in my ear, and as I made my way inside that attracted quite a lot of people to ask where I'm from. To have people notice the flowers and know that Pacific islands' people are here is a good thing. I was a little bit nervous at first as I sat waiting to speak. I was thinking to myself: ""Just breathe. Take it in. Everyone in the crowd is human. They're exactly like me."" When I walked out to deliver my speech, I knew where the Samoan delegation was sitting, so I tried to face them. But because they were under ""S"" they were a bit far back. Then I looked to the front. I could see Sir David Attenborough and then I could see US President Joe Biden - those were the only two faces I could make out. Sir David Attenborough to leaders: 'The world is looking to you' I told the audience: ""We are not drowning - we are fighting."" Brianna Fruean addresses COP26 My Day at COP26: 'My island home is threatened - we have no hill to run to' âMy dog doesn't care if Biden is hereâ 'It's my job to keep the summit fed - sustainably' 'By helping out delegates I'm remembering granddad' 'My Madagascans left, now I've got Pacific islanders' It felt great to be heard. The words I shared didn't just belong to me - they belong to my community, they belong to every single Pacific island. I think that was really important for me to tell the world leaders that they don't need my tears and my pain - and quite frankly, they don't deserve it. The next thing I'm going to do is look for the New Zealand delegation. New Zealand is a gateway to most Pacific islands - so if you can get to New Zealand you can get home. I'm going to ask them for help. As told to Jon Kelly The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

Can COP26 really save the planet?,"Climate change is linked to more extreme weather like flooding which killed 200 people in Germany this summer Will COP26 be a climate ""turning point"" as Boris Johnson wants, or more ""blah blah blah"" of the kind Greta Thunberg condemns? At face value, things do not look promising, for a simple reason: the previous 25 of these giant conferences failed to turn off the tap of the greenhouse gases that are driving up global temperatures. Despite three decades of talking, the planet is now at least 1.1C hotter than the pre-industrial level - and rising. Even if everyone sticks to their current promises to reduce emissions, we'll still be on course for a dangerous increase of 2.7C by the end of the century. For this conference, however, expectations for real progress are higher than usual. That's partly because the risks are hitting home. This year floods killed 200 people in Germany, heatwaves struck chilly Canada and even the Siberian Arctic was burning. And scientists now have the evidence to say it's unequivocal that human activity is behind climate change and that's making violent extremes more likely. They're also clearer than ever that avoiding the most damaging temperatures means halving global carbon emissions by 2030 - a deadline looming close enough to focus minds. Arnold Schwarzenegger angered by world leaders' climate policies Greta Thunberg: 'We need public pressure, not just summits' Four numbers that set the stage for COP26 Oil chiefs grilled on climate disinformation And we are seeing something unimaginable even a few years ago: an unprecedented flurry of countries and businesses, some more plausibly than others, pledging to go net zero by mid-century. That means any greenhouse gases they're still releasing by then should be balanced by an equivalent amount absorbed from the atmosphere, through tree-planting for example. So will Glasgow be the venue where the world shifts towards a zero-carbon future? In truth, it's never likely that a single meeting could ever achieve that. COPs were set up specifically for governments to tackle climate change, and the annual round of conferences does remain the only forum to tackle the problem collectively. But they operate by consensus between nearly 200 countries that all have very different perspectives. This video can not be played Watch how three Kuwaitis cope in their country's ""unbearable"" heat ""Try herding 200 cats,"" one official once told me. Many of the nations that are rich in oil or coal have been downright hostile to the whole climate agenda, and have tried everything to slow it down. Others that are poor and vulnerable see rising temperatures threatening their very existence and are desperate for help. At the first COP I reported from, in the deep freeze of a Montreal winter in 2005, the pace of talks matched the glacial weather. Negotiators were arguing overnight over 'square brackets' that marked unresolved and impenetrable points in a text that was never destined to leave much of a trace. When they finally reached agreement at dawn - and I spotted the then UK environment secretary Margaret Beckett with tears in her eyes - I asked a veteran observer what was being celebrated. ""They've agreed to keep talking,"" he said, without irony. ""So the process continues."" And the conferences have rolled on, more or less productively, and at the nine I've witnessed so far, there have been some painful scenes. In Nairobi in 2006, I heard a frustrated German minister ask why anyone bothered to turn up. In Bali in 2007, the top UN official, exhausted and exasperated, started weeping openly. A really simple guide to climate change How do we know humans caused climate change? How hot could it get where you live? And in Copenhagen in 2009, clumsy hosting triggered walkouts that nearly led the talks to collapse. Yet one former UK government adviser, who was at the heart of those negotiations in Denmark, believes that COPs, for all their faults, are an essential mechanism. Without them, according to Prof Mike Jacobs - now of the University of Sheffield - ""emissions would have risen even higher than they are now"". He says having ""a simultaneous and collective commitment"" forces governments to stay focused on the problem. And that led to the COP that stands out as a rare example of success - Paris in 2015. The French government, supported by a carefully cultivated alliance, ushered in the Paris Agreement, the first accord of its kind to tackle climate change. This was a landmark moment because never before had every country agreed to act together to limit the rise in temperatures to 2C or, if possible, a lower target of 1.5C. Climate change is one of the world's most pressing problems.Governments must promise more ambitious cuts in warming gases if we are to prevent greater global temperature rises. The summit in Glasgow is where change could happen.You need to watch for the promises made by the world's biggest polluters, like the US and China, and whether poorer countries are getting the support they need. All our lives will change.Decisions made here could affect our jobs, how we heat our homes, what we eat and how we travel. Read more about the COP26 summit here. Yes, the most difficult small print was left unresolved and the accord is entirely voluntary - no country is obliged to cut its emissions faster than it wants to. But Prof Jacobs reckons that setting up a global framework generated a sense of momentum, which in itself has proved significant. That's because more and more of the world's governments are now setting their own targets for renewable energy or phasing out petrol and diesel cars, and that sends a message to businesses that the agenda is serious. So investments in wind and solar power have recently been so vast that their costs have tumbled, which in turn makes a zero-carbon transition more feasible. And provided the Glasgow talks don't collapse in acrimony, that signal of a greener direction should get even more attention. It could be a 'tipping-point' where big investors start to shift their trillions of dollars out of fossil fuels - a few days ago Europe's largest pension fund announced it would do just that. Already the giant carmakers are having to gear up to go electric, and shipping companies - long accused of dragging their feet - are under pressure to clean up too. Plans to decarbonise even the most polluting industries - with so-called 'green cement' and 'green steel' - are becoming more mainstream. But the speed of this response is the key question for COP26. As things stand, given all the pledges made so far, greenhouse gas emissions are actually set to rise by 16% by 2030, rather than fall by 45% as the science demands. And if the picture remains unchanged after a fortnight of talking, the accusations of failure will come thick and fast. A second challenge is finance for the poorest countries, hit hardest by rising sea levels, floods and droughts, and needing help to go green. They've long felt let down, seeing promises unfulfilled, including a key pledge that was seen as a fundamental issue of trust, for assistance worth $100bn a year to be delivered by now. Prof Saleemul Huq, an adviser to the prime minister of Bangladesh, is among those cynical about the whole process. ""This annual shindig is redundant - it's not as if climate change is an issue just once a year. ""It's happening now for everyone, every day, not some time in the future - it needs attention all the time."" So what is Prof Huq expecting? ""I presume they'll manage to pull a rabbit out of the hat in the end but you journalists must check the details of what's announced - is it really what they say it is?"" Ultimately, the conferences provide a focus for climate action but they can never lead to a transformation overnight. The observer in Montreal was right: it's about a process. And in a sign of managed expectations for Glasgow, there's talk of the next gatherings: COP27 in Egypt, and COP28, maybe in Qatar. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

What summit could mean for us all,"A new global agreement - the Glasgow Climate Pact - was reached at the COP26 summit. It aims to reduce the worst impacts of climate change - but some leaders and campaigners say it does not go far enough. The agreement - although not legally binding - will set the global agenda on climate change for the next decade: Emissions It was agreed countries will meet next year to pledge further cuts to emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2) - agreenhouse gas which causes climate change. This is to try to keep temperature rises within 1.5C - which scientists say is required to prevent a ""climate catastrophe"". Current pledges, if met, will only limit global warming to about 2.4C. Coal For the first time at a COP conference, there was an explicit plan to reduce use of coal - which is responsible for 40% of annual CO2 emissions. However, countries only agreed a weaker commitment to ""phase down"" rather than ""phase out"" coal after a late intervention by China and India. PM: Climate deal sounds death knell for coal power Evasive words and coal compromise, but deal shows progress Developing countries The agreement pledged to significantly increase money to help poor countries cope with the effects of climate change and make the switch to clean energy. There's also the prospect of a trillion dollar a year fund from 2025 - after a previous pledge for richer countries to provide $100bn (Â£72bn) a year by 2020 was missed. While some observers say the COP26 agreement represented the ""start of a breakthrough"", some African and Latin American countries felt not enough progress was made. Why hasn't climate pledge to poor countries been met? Fossil fuel subsidies World leaders agreed to phase-out subsidies that artificially lower the price of coal, oil, or natural gas. However, no firm dates have been set. How much is still spent supporting oil, coal and gas? A flurry of other announcements were made: The world's biggest CO2 emitters, the US and China,pledged to cooperate more over the next decadein areas including methane emissions and the switch to clean energy. China has previously been reluctant to tackle domestic coal emissions - so this was seen as recognising the need for urgent action. Cautious welcome for US-China climate agreement Why China's climate policy matters to us all Leaders from more than 100 countries - with about 85% of the world's forests -promised to stop deforestationby 2030. This is seen as vital, as trees absorb vast amounts of CO2. Similar initiativeshaven't stopped deforestation, but this one's better funded. However, it's unclear how the pledge will be policed. Ascheme to cut 30% of methane emissions by 2030was agreed by more than 100 countries. Methane is currently responsible for a third of human-generated warming. The big emitters China, Russia and India haven't joined - but it's hoped they will later. Financial organisations controlling $130tnagreed to back ""clean"" technology, such as renewable energy, and direct finance away from fossil fuel-burning industries. The initiative is an attempt to involve private companies in meeting net zero targets. However, some environmental organisations have said without a greater commitment to ending support for fossil-fuels, this could be little more than a PR exercise. Most commitments made at COP will have to be self-policed. Only a few countries are making their pledges legally binding. COP26 was the moment countries revisited climate pledges made made under the 2015Paris Agreement. Six years ago, countries were asked to make changes to keep global warming ""well below"" 2C - and to try to aim for 1.5C. COP stands for ""Conference of the Parties"", and the one in Glasgow was the 26th annual summit. Ahead of it, 200 countries were asked for their plans to cut emissions by 2030. The goal is to keep cutting emissions until they reachnet zeroby mid-century. Next year's COP27 summit is in Egypt. Simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like for you?

The challenges that COP26 needs to tackle,"World leaders are arriving in Glasgow for the COP26 climate summit, where they will be asked to make ambitious cuts in warming gases to prevent further global temperature rises. As negotiators prepare for two intense weeks of talking, here are five major challenges that have to be overcome. Forget talk of temperature rises or dirty coal. The real challenge facing negotiators at this key conference is the issue of trust, or the lack of it. The key relationships that led to success at the major climate conference in Paris in 2015 have all taken a battering. The US and China came together then to reach agreement. After four years of Donald Trump and increasing rivalry, the two countries now eye each other with deep suspicion. Climate change is one of the world's most pressing problems.Governments must promise more ambitious cuts in warming gases if we are to prevent greater global temperature rises. The summit in Glasgow is where change could happen.You need to watch for the promises made by the world's biggest polluters, like the US and China, and whether poorer countries are getting the support they need. All our lives will change.Decisions made here could impact our jobs, how we heat our homes, what we eat and how we travel. Read more about the COP26 summit here. Four numbers to better understand COP26 The so-called ""high ambition coalition"" of island states, developing economies and the EU that really pushed things forward in France in 2015, is now not the force it was. On top of all that, there's also money problems: The failure of the international community to make good on the delivery of a long-promised $100bn to help poorer countries cope with climate change has gone down badly. However you dress it up, it has dented trust at a critical time. Speaking at the G20 meeting in Rome just before flying to Glasgow for the COP, UN Secretary General Antonio Guterres underlined just how important the question of trust was. ""If we want real success, and not just a mirage, we need more ambition and more action,"" he said. ""That will only be possible with a massive mobilization of political will. And that requires trust among the key actors."" ""Today, trust is in short supply. There are serious questions of credibility."" Unless this deficit is overcome, Glasgow is likely to fall well short. Key to any success in Glasgow has to be the credibility of the host nation. France is generally seen as setting the bar for what a successful presidency looks like, when it hosted the Paris COP in 2015. UK minister Alok Sharma will be in charge of the negotiations for COP26 The UK faces some challenges in this area, though it has some credit in the bank too. ""The UK has led from the front for many years,"" said Kaveh Guilanpour, a long-time climate negotiator and now with the Centre for Climate and Energy Solutions. The government's strong commitment to the Paris goal of achieving net zero by 2050 - that is, to not add any more carbon emissions to the atmosphere than it can remove - creates credibility, he says. However, on the other side of the ledger, the UK government has run into trouble over plans for a coal mine in Cumbria, and by announcing cuts to air passenger duty just last week. Of even more importance perhaps isthe cut to Overseas Development Aid(ODA), which saw that UK's annual support reduced from 0.7% of national income to 0.5%. ""Boris Johnson and his Cabinet have undoubtedly made life additionally difficult for themselves,"" said Richard Black, a senior associate at the Energy and Climate Intelligence Unit. One of the biggest challenges for this COP is the sheer volume of work. The postponement of last year's meeting due to Covid is one cause, but it's also because efforts to carry out the negotiations virtually haven't worked. Delegates were happy to talk, but refused to take decisions until they met face to face. So Glasgow has a huge agenda, particularly on the question of financing how countries deal with climate change. Negotiators asleep as talks drag through the night in Copenhagen COP15 in 2009 There are also complex details about how the Paris agreement should be implemented that still haven't been resolved. Questions on transparency, carbon markets, and having the same timeframes for cutting carbon emissions, have defied the best efforts of negotiators in the six years since Paris. ""There is a real risk that failure on a relatively small issue at the end of the second week could be the headline,"" said Mr Guilanpour. ""The huge backlog means there are highly controversial items that could cause delays with serious consequences for getting all the work done."" There is a growing sense among many participants that this UN negotiating process is no longer fit for purpose. The need for consensus from 197 parties, and the legalistic and technical nature of the talks, means there is, in reality, very little room for actual negotiations. For this summit, the UK has been determined to bring in real world examples of success to show that fighting climate change can be good for the planet and good for business. The UK is also eager to conclude a series of side deals on questions like deforestation, on methane, on coal and on protecting nature - it believes that the COP needs to be seen as not just a dull talking shop, but a space to highlight best practice and encourage action. This video can not be played Watch how three Kuwaitis cope in their country's ""unbearable"" heat Some participants believe the climate crisis is now so serious they want to see real reform of the COP to bring in carrots and sticks for countries to meet their pledges. ""There has to be an accountability factor, because otherwise, countries can pledge anything and can promise anything,"" says Dr Deborah Brosnan, who's advising the Antigua and Barbuda team here. For months, politicians, negotiators and journalists have been arguing over what success at this conference looks like. This isn't Paris in 2015 or Copenhagen in 2009, where deal/no deal made it very easy to tell if it was thumbs up or down. The UK's stated aim to ""keep 1.5C alive"" - referring to the limit to the annual rise in average temperatures, compared to pre-industrial times. It is a handy sound bite that belies the massive shift in ambition required to achieve it. Look a little closer and what the UK actually means is that it wants to deliver a ""roadmap"" (odd choice of word) that will essentially mean that all countries revise their carbon cutting targets in the very short term, not every five years as is currently the case. Alternatively, and more likely, the COP might finish with a bun-fight where developing countries reject any attempt to get them to come back with improved offers in a year or three. The UK might be left with a wishy-washy political declaration that aspires to more but doesn't commit anyone to actually do anything. And all the extra commitments on issues like cutting methane emissions, shipping emissions and so on, might be an unenforceable wish list, dressed up to impress. Once the final gavel comes down, expect a head-turning flurry of spin from the UK and others to convince the world that Glasgow has really delivered. ""Briefings go directly from the political leader's office to political journalists who rarely have any background in the UN climate process,"" said Richard Black, who is also a former BBC environment correspondent. ""News coverage often focuses on political theatre rather than the actual issues. Rhetorical leadership gets mistaken for the real thing."" But keep the central question in mind. Is the prospect of keeping the world under 1.5C of warming now more likely? ""If there's a golden rule to cutting through the spin, it's to try and understand the issues, and look at what leaders do, not at what they say,"" said Mr Black.

'I was nervous. Breathe I said. I looked up to see Biden',"Samoan climate activist Brianna Fruean, 23, addressed world leaders at the opening of COP26. In the first of a series of first-person accounts from the Glasgow summit, she describes what it felt like to speak up for Pacific islanders - whose homes and way of life are under threat from rising sea levels. I woke up early, about 06:00. And I thought: ""Today's finally the day."" I'd spent a couple of days working on my speech - writing it out, making cuts. I felt immense pressure to represent the Pacific well. Due to uncertainty around Covid, so few Pacific delegates have been able to get to the UK. And with all the quarantine rules - you need to go via New Zealand to get to Samoa - I left not knowing when I might be able to go back. I remember, at primary school, my teacher telling my class that climate change could mean small islands like Samoa, Tutuila and Tonga might drown. I just thought, ""I'm not going to let my islands drown."" So I set up an environmental group at school. I started a chapter of the global climate movement - 350.org. I was the youngest co-ordinator at the time, at 11 years old. Today it was a bit chaotic getting into the summit. But I hope that the reason it was so chaotic was because there's heaps of people here who care. I wear a flower in my ear, and as I made my way inside that attracted quite a lot of people to ask where I'm from. To have people notice the flowers and know that Pacific islands' people are here is a good thing. I was a little bit nervous at first as I sat waiting to speak. I was thinking to myself: ""Just breathe. Take it in. Everyone in the crowd is human. They're exactly like me."" When I walked out to deliver my speech, I knew where the Samoan delegation was sitting, so I tried to face them. But because they were under ""S"" they were a bit far back. Then I looked to the front. I could see Sir David Attenborough and then I could see US President Joe Biden - those were the only two faces I could make out. Sir David Attenborough to leaders: 'The world is looking to you' I told the audience: ""We are not drowning - we are fighting."" Brianna Fruean addresses COP26 My Day at COP26: 'My island home is threatened - we have no hill to run to' âMy dog doesn't care if Biden is hereâ 'It's my job to keep the summit fed - sustainably' 'By helping out delegates I'm remembering granddad' 'My Madagascans left, now I've got Pacific islanders' It felt great to be heard. The words I shared didn't just belong to me - they belong to my community, they belong to every single Pacific island. I think that was really important for me to tell the world leaders that they don't need my tears and my pain - and quite frankly, they don't deserve it. The next thing I'm going to do is look for the New Zealand delegation. New Zealand is a gateway to most Pacific islands - so if you can get to New Zealand you can get home. I'm going to ask them for help. As told to Jon Kelly The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

UK threatens legal action over French fishing row,"This video can not be played Liz Truss: France has made completely unacceptable threats The UK is prepared to take legal action against France over the ongoing row about post-Brexit fishing rights, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has warned. Last month, the UK and Jersey denied permits to dozens of French boats to operate in their waters. In retaliation, France threatened to block British boats from some of its ports and cut electricity to Jersey. Ms Truss told the BBC that France was acting ""unfairly"" in setting a deadline for issuing more fishing permits. France says that, unless this happens by Tuesday, it will prevent British fishing boats from disembarking at its ports, and step up border checks on UK goods. Officials in Paris have also threatened to tighten security checks on British boats, and increase checks on trucks going to and from the UK. Representatives from the European Commission, France, the UK and the Channel Islands are holding talks via video link on Monday afternoon. A commission spokesperson said they hoped the meeting would bring a ""swift solution on the outstanding issues"". Fishing after Brexit: What are the rules? Turbulence has hit relations with France, PM says Who really owns UK fishing rights? France has accused the UK of making a ""political choice"" by rejecting ""more than 40%"" of French boats' applications to fish in UK and Channel Island waters. But the UK's Brexit minister Lord Frost has said the UK had been ""very generous"" in granting 98% of applications from EU vessels. Ms Truss told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that fishing licences had been awarded to French boats ""entirely in accordance"" with the post-Brexit deal between the EU and UK. She warned that unless France withdrew its threats, the UK was prepared to ""use the dispute resolution mechanism in the trade deal we signed with the EU to take action against the French"". ""We're simply not going to roll over in the face of these threats,"" she added. For Labour, shadow business secretary Ed Miliband told Sky News he ""didn't like the way the French had behaved"" and urged both sides to ""lower the temperature"" of the debate. Emmanuel Macron is under massive pressure from the nationalist right in France in the lead-up to next year's presidential election. He has a lot to gain from the metaphorical waving of the French flag, being seen to be standing up to ""perfidious Albion"", as the French have sometimes referred to the Brits (or the English, depending on the exact moment in history) for centuries. Boris Johnson too knows that a row with the French - or with Brussels - plays well with much of his Conservative Party and many of his supporters. A useful diversion, say critics, from domestic problems like soaring gas prices, haulier shortages and studies, like the recent one published by the Office for Budget Responsibility, suggesting that Brexit will cost the UK economy more than Covid-19. Read Katya's blog in full On Sunday, Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron met for 30 minutes during the G20 summit but failed to resolved the problem. The UK government said it was ""up to France"" to draw back from its threats, while Mr Macron insisted the ball was ""in Britain's court"". UK-French tensions were further inflamed on Friday, when a letter emerged from French Prime Minister Jean Castex to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen suggesting the fishing dispute was an opportunity to show that EU countries risked more damage from leaving the bloc than staying in. Mr Johnson said he was ""puzzled to read a letter from the French prime minister explicitly asking for Britain to be punished for leaving the EU"". Although fishing is a small part of both the British and French economies, it has been a highly sensitive political issue throughout Brexit. The latest row began after a British trawler was seized by France and another fined during checks off Le Havre on Thursday.

"Show statesmanship on climate, Queen urges leaders","This video can not be played ""The time for words has now moved to the time for action"" â watch the Queen's video message to world leaders The Queen has urged world leaders at the COP26 climate summit to ""achieve true statesmanship"" and create a ""safer, stabler future"" for the planet. In a video message, she said many people hoped the ""time for words has now moved to the time for action"". She urged them to act ""for our children and our children's children"" and ""rise above the politics of the moment"". The Queen added she took ""great pride"" in how her ""dear late husband"" Prince Philip promoted environmental issues. The 95-year-old monarch had been scheduled to attend the United Nations conference in Glasgow. But she pre-recorded her address last week at Windsor Castle after being advised to rest following medical checks. The Prince of Wales and Duke of Cambridge are both attending the COP26 conference, which is seen as a crucial gathering if temperature increases and climate changes are to be limited. LIVE: Latest updates from COP26 Royals join leaders at COP26 dinner reception Can COP26 really save the planet? What the COP26 climate summit could mean for us all Get serious on climate now or it's too late - PM In her address, the Queen recalled how the ""impact of the environment on human progress was a subject close to the heart"" of the Duke of Edinburgh. She referred to his warning at a 1969 academic gathering of the dangers of failing to address pollution. The Queen said: ""It is a source of great pride to me that the leading role my husband played in encouraging people to protect our fragile planet, lives on through the work of our eldest son Charles and his eldest son William. ""I could not be more proud of them."" Even though not there in person, this was a surprisingly personal message from the Queen. She mentions how the environment was a subject close to the heart of ""my dear late husband"" Prince Philip and says she ""could not be more proud"" that it was an interest sustained by her son Charles and grandson William. She also seems to make reference to her own mortality: ""None of us will live forever."" But there is also the authoritative voice of someone looking back after almost 70 years as head of state, telling world leaders to take the long view and ""rise above the politics of the moment"". The Queen says ""statesmanship"" means serving the future rather than short-term political rewards. She might be on the video screen but she was telling world leaders to focus on the big picture. The Queen said she also drew ""great comfort and inspiration from the relentless enthusiasm of people of all ages - especially the young - in calling for everyone to play their part"". She said: ""In the coming days, the world has the chance to join in the shared objective of creating a safer, stabler future for our people and for the planet on which we depend. ""None of us underestimates the challenges ahead: but history has shown that when nations come together in common cause, there is always room for hope.""

She added: ""It is the hope of many that the legacy of this summit - written in history books yet to be printed - will describe you as the leaders who did not pass up the opportunity; and that you answered the call of those future generations. ""That you left this conference as a community of nations with a determination, a desire, and a plan, to address the impact of climate change; and to recognise that the time for words has now moved to the time for action. ""Of course, the benefits of such actions will not be there to enjoy for all of us here today: we none of us will live forever. ""But we are doing this not for ourselves but for our children and our children's children, and those who will follow in their footsteps."" Ahead of COP26, theQueen was overheard appearing to suggest she was irritatedby people who ""talk"" but ""don't do"", when it comes to climate issues. Prince Charles told COP26 earlier that a ""war-like footing"" is needed to tackle the climate Addressing the opening of the conference earlier in the day, the Prince of Wales urged world leaders into action, saying he understood that many countries could not afford to ""go green"". Instead, he said, there needs to be a ""vast military-style campaign to marshal the strength of the global private sector"", which had trillions of dollars at its disposal.

Barclays boss in shock exit angry at Epstein probeJes Staley is leaving the bank following an investigation into his links to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein.Business,"Barclays boss Jes Staley is ""shell-shocked, angry and upset"" at the conclusion of a probe into his links to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein which has led to his sudden exit from the bank. Insiders close to Mr Staley said he was surprised by City regulators' findings. They have been investigating if Mr Staley's links with the dead financier were closer than first thought. Barclays said it had been made aware of the conclusions of the probe and ""Mr Staley's intention to contest them"". At the heart of Mr Staley's departure is apparently a perceived inconsistency between his account to his own board of his relationship with Epstein and evidence seen by the regulators. Mr Staley insists that while Epstein was an important client of JP Morgan, where Mr Staley worked for a number of years and as such they were in contact regularly, their dealings were well within the grounds that could be described as professional. The BBC understands the regulator took the view that the volume and tone of the emails between the two suggested a closer relationship than the purely professional. But Barclays has stated that the report makes no findings that Mr Staley saw, or was aware of, any of Epstein's crimes. The relationship between a US high net worth individual and his private banker is not like your average relationship with the bank manager. In fact, it would be quite odd if Mr Staley had not visited Epstein at home or indeed vice versa. Nevertheless, the board of Barclays clearly felt that the perceived disconnect between the accounts of the relationship would mean an extended and distracting wrangle with the regulator. Having accepted Mr Staley's promise that he had been totally transparent about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, the board described itself as ""disappointed"", but accepted that it would not be possible for Mr Staley to run the bank while being in open dispute with the regulator. This is not the first time the board of Barclays has been blindsided by Mr Staley. In 2018, he was fined Â£642,000 and Barclays Â£15m after Mr Staley took it upon himself to instruct the bank's own security unit to track down a whistleblower who had raised concerns about the suitability of the appointment of a former colleague of the chief executive. That could have been a straight red card but he escaped with a yellow. The board will also be disappointed because Mr Staley's strategy for the bank seemed to be paying off.  He saw off an activist shareholder challenge to split the investment and retail banks, the investment bank had started delivering good returns and the profits were beating analyst estimates. But ultimately, boards don't like surprises - particularly ones that are perceived to tarnish a reputation and culture they have spent many years trying to rehabilitate. Regulators began investigating the Barclays boss after getting a cache of emails between the men from Mr Staley's former employer. Before joining Barclays the married father-of-two was an executive at US bank JP Morgan, where Epstein, who took his own life in 2019 while in prison, was already a client. Over many years, Epstein, who was convicted of trafficking a minor for prostitution in 2008 and served 13 months in custody, cultivated contact with the rich and powerful, including former US presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump. Who was Jeffrey Epstein? Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates has spoken of his ""huge mistake"" in spending time with Epstein, while the equally super-rich Leon Black stood down from US private equity firm Apollo Global Management over his links. Although Mr Staley, 63, has characterised his relationship with Epstein as professional, with contact starting to ""taper off"" from about 2013, regulators wanted to know whether the emails pointed to a friendlier connection. Mr Staley had already admitted he maintained contact with Epstein for about seven years after his 2008 conviction. And it is also known Mr Staley visited Little St James, a retreat owned by Epstein in the US Virgin Islands in 2015, months before taking the top job at Barclays. In fairness to Mr Staley, he is not the only boss of Barclays to have fallen from grace in recent times. In fact, he is the bank's fifth chief executive in seven years - following in the footsteps of men such asBob Diamond, who resigned over an interest rate-rigging scandal, andAntony Jenkins, who was sacked after falling out with the board over the bank's cost-cutting and profitability. During the pandemic, Mr Staley spoke out against the culture of working from home, saying it was ""not sustainable"". At a virtual meeting of the World Economic Forum, he said: ""It will increasingly be a challenge to maintain the culture and collaboration that these large financial institutions seek to have and should have."" Now Barclays faces the task of maintaining its culture without him - and he may prove a hard act to follow. Read more about Mr Staley here. Mr Staley said last year: ""Obviously I thought I knew him well and I didn't. For sure, with hindsight with what we know now, I deeply regret having any relationship with Jeffrey."" He has yet to comment publicly on Monday's news, but Reuters reported it had seen an internal memo from him indicating he did not want plans to contest the investigation's findings to be a distraction. ""Although I will not be with you for the next chapter of Barclays' story, know that I will be cheering your success from the sidelines,"" the memo reportedly said. Barclays said in a announcement on Monday,externalthat it was ""made aware on Friday evening of the preliminary conclusions from the FCA and the PRA of their investigation into Mr Staley's characterisation to Barclays of his relationship with the late Mr Jeffrey Epstein and the subsequent description of that relationship in Barclays' response to the FCA"". ""In view of those conclusions, and Mr Staley's intention to contest them, the board and Mr Staley have agreed that he will step down. ""It should be noted that the investigation makes no findings that Mr Staley saw, or was aware of, any of Epstein's alleged crimes, which was the central question underpinning Barclays' support for Mr Staley following the arrest of Mr Epstein in the summer of 2019."" Jes Staley visited Little St James, an island own by Jeffrey Epstein, months before he started at Barclays Barclays praised Mr Staley's success at the bank, but added that ""the regulatory process had still to run its full course and it was not appropriate for Barclays to comment further on the preliminary conclusions"". The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) announced an investigation last year into Mr Staley's ""characterisation to the company of his relationship"" with Epstein. Barclays said last year that following Epstein's death in 2019, Mr Staley had ""volunteered and gave to certain executives, and the chairman, an explanation of his relationship with Mr Epstein"". Jeffrey Epstein died in a New York prison cell in 2019 The probe's conclusions are yet to be made public, but Hargreaves Lansdown's senior investment analyst Susannah Streeter said it seems clear they are critical of Mr Staley. ""Although detail is limited, it appears regulators believe there was a distinct lack of transparency over this relationship,"" she said. ""It's understood Mr Staley will contest the conclusions, and clearly the board want to distance Barclays from what could be a long drawn out process."" Mr Staley has faced regulatory scrutiny before during his six years at Barclays. In 2018, he was fined Â£642,430 by the FCA and PRAfor trying to unmask a whistleblowerwho had raised concerns about a senior executive appointment at the bank's US operation. Many commentators thought the chief executive was lucky to stay in his job. Under the terms of his contract with Barclays, Mr Staley will receive 12 months' pay, totalling Â£2.4m, as well as his pension allowance of Â£120,000 for the year, and any other benefits. He will be replaced as chief executive by Mr C.S. Venkatakrishnan, known as Venkat, subject to regulatory approval. The board said Venkat had been identified as its preferred candidate for the role over a year ago. Reuters said it had seen another internal memo, from Venkat, telling staff Mr Staley's strategy at Barclays was the ""right one"", although he added he would announce changes to the organisation in the coming days.

Barclays boss in shock exit angry at Epstein probe,"Barclays boss Jes Staley is ""shell-shocked, angry and upset"" at the conclusion of a probe into his links to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein which has led to his sudden exit from the bank. Insiders close to Mr Staley said he was surprised by City regulators' findings. They have been investigating if Mr Staley's links with the dead financier were closer than first thought. Barclays said it had been made aware of the conclusions of the probe and ""Mr Staley's intention to contest them"". At the heart of Mr Staley's departure is apparently a perceived inconsistency between his account to his own board of his relationship with Epstein and evidence seen by the regulators. Mr Staley insists that while Epstein was an important client of JP Morgan, where Mr Staley worked for a number of years and as such they were in contact regularly, their dealings were well within the grounds that could be described as professional. The BBC understands the regulator took the view that the volume and tone of the emails between the two suggested a closer relationship than the purely professional. But Barclays has stated that the report makes no findings that Mr Staley saw, or was aware of, any of Epstein's crimes. The relationship between a US high net worth individual and his private banker is not like your average relationship with the bank manager. In fact, it would be quite odd if Mr Staley had not visited Epstein at home or indeed vice versa. Nevertheless, the board of Barclays clearly felt that the perceived disconnect between the accounts of the relationship would mean an extended and distracting wrangle with the regulator. Having accepted Mr Staley's promise that he had been totally transparent about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, the board described itself as ""disappointed"", but accepted that it would not be possible for Mr Staley to run the bank while being in open dispute with the regulator. This is not the first time the board of Barclays has been blindsided by Mr Staley. In 2018, he was fined Â£642,000 and Barclays Â£15m after Mr Staley took it upon himself to instruct the bank's own security unit to track down a whistleblower who had raised concerns about the suitability of the appointment of a former colleague of the chief executive. That could have been a straight red card but he escaped with a yellow. The board will also be disappointed because Mr Staley's strategy for the bank seemed to be paying off.  He saw off an activist shareholder challenge to split the investment and retail banks, the investment bank had started delivering good returns and the profits were beating analyst estimates. But ultimately, boards don't like surprises - particularly ones that are perceived to tarnish a reputation and culture they have spent many years trying to rehabilitate. Regulators began investigating the Barclays boss after getting a cache of emails between the men from Mr Staley's former employer. Before joining Barclays the married father-of-two was an executive at US bank JP Morgan, where Epstein, who took his own life in 2019 while in prison, was already a client. Over many years, Epstein, who was convicted of trafficking a minor for prostitution in 2008 and served 13 months in custody, cultivated contact with the rich and powerful, including former US presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump. Who was Jeffrey Epstein? Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates has spoken of his ""huge mistake"" in spending time with Epstein, while the equally super-rich Leon Black stood down from US private equity firm Apollo Global Management over his links. Although Mr Staley, 63, has characterised his relationship with Epstein as professional, with contact starting to ""taper off"" from about 2013, regulators wanted to know whether the emails pointed to a friendlier connection. Mr Staley had already admitted he maintained contact with Epstein for about seven years after his 2008 conviction. And it is also known Mr Staley visited Little St James, a retreat owned by Epstein in the US Virgin Islands in 2015, months before taking the top job at Barclays. In fairness to Mr Staley, he is not the only boss of Barclays to have fallen from grace in recent times. In fact, he is the bank's fifth chief executive in seven years - following in the footsteps of men such asBob Diamond, who resigned over an interest rate-rigging scandal, andAntony Jenkins, who was sacked after falling out with the board over the bank's cost-cutting and profitability. During the pandemic, Mr Staley spoke out against the culture of working from home, saying it was ""not sustainable"". At a virtual meeting of the World Economic Forum, he said: ""It will increasingly be a challenge to maintain the culture and collaboration that these large financial institutions seek to have and should have."" Now Barclays faces the task of maintaining its culture without him - and he may prove a hard act to follow. Read more about Mr Staley here. Mr Staley said last year: ""Obviously I thought I knew him well and I didn't. For sure, with hindsight with what we know now, I deeply regret having any relationship with Jeffrey."" He has yet to comment publicly on Monday's news, but Reuters reported it had seen an internal memo from him indicating he did not want plans to contest the investigation's findings to be a distraction. ""Although I will not be with you for the next chapter of Barclays' story, know that I will be cheering your success from the sidelines,"" the memo reportedly said. Barclays said in a announcement on Monday,externalthat it was ""made aware on Friday evening of the preliminary conclusions from the FCA and the PRA of their investigation into Mr Staley's characterisation to Barclays of his relationship with the late Mr Jeffrey Epstein and the subsequent description of that relationship in Barclays' response to the FCA"". ""In view of those conclusions, and Mr Staley's intention to contest them, the board and Mr Staley have agreed that he will step down. ""It should be noted that the investigation makes no findings that Mr Staley saw, or was aware of, any of Epstein's alleged crimes, which was the central question underpinning Barclays' support for Mr Staley following the arrest of Mr Epstein in the summer of 2019."" Jes Staley visited Little St James, an island own by Jeffrey Epstein, months before he started at Barclays Barclays praised Mr Staley's success at the bank, but added that ""the regulatory process had still to run its full course and it was not appropriate for Barclays to comment further on the preliminary conclusions"". The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) announced an investigation last year into Mr Staley's ""characterisation to the company of his relationship"" with Epstein. Barclays said last year that following Epstein's death in 2019, Mr Staley had ""volunteered and gave to certain executives, and the chairman, an explanation of his relationship with Mr Epstein"". Jeffrey Epstein died in a New York prison cell in 2019 The probe's conclusions are yet to be made public, but Hargreaves Lansdown's senior investment analyst Susannah Streeter said it seems clear they are critical of Mr Staley. ""Although detail is limited, it appears regulators believe there was a distinct lack of transparency over this relationship,"" she said. ""It's understood Mr Staley will contest the conclusions, and clearly the board want to distance Barclays from what could be a long drawn out process."" Mr Staley has faced regulatory scrutiny before during his six years at Barclays. In 2018, he was fined Â£642,430 by the FCA and PRAfor trying to unmask a whistleblowerwho had raised concerns about a senior executive appointment at the bank's US operation. Many commentators thought the chief executive was lucky to stay in his job. Under the terms of his contract with Barclays, Mr Staley will receive 12 months' pay, totalling Â£2.4m, as well as his pension allowance of Â£120,000 for the year, and any other benefits. He will be replaced as chief executive by Mr C.S. Venkatakrishnan, known as Venkat, subject to regulatory approval. The board said Venkat had been identified as its preferred candidate for the role over a year ago. Reuters said it had seen another internal memo, from Venkat, telling staff Mr Staley's strategy at Barclays was the ""right one"", although he added he would announce changes to the organisation in the coming days. In a statement, the FCA and PRA said they ""do not comment on ongoing investigations or regulatory proceedings beyond confirming the regulatory actions as detailed in the firm's announcement"".

"'I told world leaders: We're not drowning, we're fighting'","Samoan climate activist Brianna Fruean, 23, addressed world leaders at the opening of COP26. In the first of a series of first-person accounts from the Glasgow summit, she describes what it felt like to speak up for Pacific islanders - whose homes and way of life are under threat from rising sea levels. I woke up early, about 06:00. And I thought: ""Today's finally the day."" I'd spent a couple of days working on my speech - writing it out, making cuts. I felt immense pressure to represent the Pacific well. Due to uncertainty around Covid, so few Pacific delegates have been able to get to the UK. And with all the quarantine rules - you need to go via New Zealand to get to Samoa - I left not knowing when I might be able to go back. I remember, at primary school, my teacher telling my class that climate change could mean small islands like Samoa, Tutuila and Tonga might drown. I just thought, ""I'm not going to let my islands drown."" So I set up an environmental group at school. I started a chapter of the global climate movement - 350.org. I was the youngest co-ordinator at the time, at 11 years old. Today it was a bit chaotic getting into the summit. But I hope that the reason it was so chaotic was because there's heaps of people here who care. I wear a flower in my ear, and as I made my way inside that attracted quite a lot of people to ask where I'm from. To have people notice the flowers and know that Pacific islands' people are here is a good thing. I was a little bit nervous at first as I sat waiting to speak. I was thinking to myself: ""Just breathe. Take it in. Everyone in the crowd is human. They're exactly like me."" When I walked out to deliver my speech, I knew where the Samoan delegation was sitting, so I tried to face them. But because they were under ""S"" they were a bit far back. Then I looked to the front. I could see Sir David Attenborough and then I could see US President Joe Biden - those were the only two faces I could make out. Sir David Attenborough to leaders: 'The world is looking to you' I told the audience: ""We are not drowning - we are fighting."" Brianna Fruean addresses COP26 My Day at COP26: 'My island home is threatened - we have no hill to run to' âMy dog doesn't care if Biden is hereâ 'It's my job to keep the summit fed - sustainably' 'By helping out delegates I'm remembering granddad' 'My Madagascans left, now I've got Pacific islanders' It felt great to be heard. The words I shared didn't just belong to me - they belong to my community, they belong to every single Pacific island. I think that was really important for me to tell the world leaders that they don't need my tears and my pain - and quite frankly, they don't deserve it. The next thing I'm going to do is look for the New Zealand delegation. New Zealand is a gateway to most Pacific islands - so if you can get to New Zealand you can get home. I'm going to ask them for help. As told to Jon Kelly The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

Get serious on climate now or it's too late - PM,"This video can not be played Boris Johnson opened COP26 by comparing world leaders to James Bond stopping a ""doomsday device"" ""If we don't get serious about climate change today, it will be too late for our children to do so tomorrow,"" Prime Minister Boris Johnson has told leaders at the start of the COP26 summit. Mr Johnson said the conference in Glasgow ""must mark the beginning of the end"" of climate change. He was speaking to leaders from 120 countries ahead of tense talks. The COP26 conference is seen as crucial if temperature increases, and changes to the climate, are to be limited. The world is now about 1.2C warmer than it was in the 19th Century - and extreme weather events like heatwaves, floods and forest fires are already becoming more intense. The 2015 Paris climate conference called for average temperatures to rise by well below 2C, and preferably only 1.5C, when compared to pre-industrial averages. But unless more is done, the planet is already on track to warm by more than 2C by the end of this century. LIVE: Latest updates from COP26 What you can do to reduce emissions A really simple guide to climate change What the COP26 climate summit could mean for us all Speaking on Monday after a morning spent welcoming the world leaders to Glasgow, Mr Johnson said time was running out. ""The longer we fail to act, the worse it gets and the higher the price when we are eventually forced by catastrophe to act,"" he said. ""Humanity has long since run down the clock on climate change. It's one minute to midnight on that Doomsday clock and we need to act now."" The prime minister added: ""If summits alone solve climate change then we wouldn't have needed 25 previous COP summits to get where we are today. ""But while COP26 will not be the end of climate change it can and it must mark the beginning of the end."" Prince Charles is the most senior royal at the conference, after the Queen was told to rest Veteran broadcaster and environmentalist Sir David Attenborough also spoke to the leaders, and was given a standing ovation by US President Joe Biden. Alongside a dramatic soundtrack and a video showing striking images of the planet, Sir David said: ""Today, those who have done the least to cause this problem are being the hardest hit - ultimately all of us will feel the impacts, some of which are now unavoidable."" ""We are already in trouble,"" he told them - but said he hoped they would be motivated by a ""desperate hope"" rather than fear. ""In my lifetime I've witnessed a terrible decline,"" said the 95-year-old. ""In yours, you could and should witness a wonderful recovery."" This video can not be played Sir David Attenborough to COP26 delegates: ""The world is looking to you"" And in his speech, Prince Charles also urged the world leaders into action, saying he understood that many countries could not afford to ""go green"". Instead, he said, there needs to be a ""vast military-style campaign to marshal the strength of the global private sector"", which had trillions of dollars at its disposal, he said. World leadersarrived at the Scottish Events Campusin Glasgow for the official opening on Monday morning. Later, they will make statements setting out what their countries are already doing on climate change. Tap or click to go through the gallery  The venue has officially become United Nations territory for the summit - with high levels of security to get in and patrols by armed UN officers. Some people have criticised the amount of air travel the conference was generating, as estimates suggested hundreds of private planeshad flown into Glasgow. But Foreign Secretary Liz Truss earlier defended the decision to host world leaders in person, saying face-to-face talks were needed for ""crunch negotiations"" such as this. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she understood that the air travel involved may send a ""mixed message"" - but agreed that more progress is made when leaders meet in person. ""Given all of the travel required to get here, it even further increases the pressure on the shoulders of world leaders to make sure it's worth it,"" she said. The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control.

Ryanair set to cut winter fares to boost demand,"Boss Michael O'Leary says the post-pandemic recovery offers good growth opportunities Ryanair says it is expecting to cut fares this winter to help boost passenger demand. While the airline has seen business picking up recently, it warned it was still recovering from the Covid-related collapse in air travel. Ryanairreported a narrowing of half-year losses, but warned its annual deficit could hit â¬200m (Â£170m). Boss Michael O'Leary told the BBC the industry was seeing a ""very strong recovery"" across Europe. However, he said heavy price discounting would be needed to fill aircraft this winter. Keeping prices low and passenger numbers high would ""set us up strongly for a very strong recovery"", he said. Mr O'Leary added that the number of empty seats per plane would shrink from around 20% to under 10% by next summer. The airline expects to return to profitability in the year ending March 2023. ""We're seeing very strong recovery in short-haul travel across Europe and it is being led by Ryanair,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. He said there had been a ""dramatic"" recovery in passenger numbers, from eight million in the three months to June to 31 million in the following three months. On the Beach accuses Ryanair of market abuse Refund probe into Ryanair and BA dropped The recent school holidays had seen Ryanair ""full to the gills as people got a last bit of sun"", Mr O'Leary said. But that did not mean the hit to the industry from the coronavirus pandemic was over, he added. The carrier reported an after-tax loss of â¬48m for the six months to September, which compared with a loss after tax of â¬411m a year earlier. Ryanair carried 39.1 million passengers in the six months to the end of September, 54% fewer than in the same period of 2019. The airline is expecting to make of loss of between â¬100m-200m for the full year, but Mr O'Leary said the guidance could not be more specific because there was still ""little visibility"" on ticket prices and recovery. But he said the post-pandemic recovery offered the best growth opportunities of his three-decade career. In September, Ryanair lifted its passenger growth target. The airline now expects to fly 225 million passengers a year by 2026, up from 200 million previously forecast. The airline reiterated it expects to return to pre-Covid profitability in the year ending March 2023.

"Life where it's too hot to work, too hot to sleep","The climate crisis is no longer a future concern. In many parts of the world, it has already begun. Millions of people are living with extreme temperatures, facing a growing threat of flooding or wildfires. Here, five people explain how extreme temperatures have changed their lives. Shakeela Bano often lays out her family's bedding on the roof of their one-storey house in India. Some nights it's too hot to sleep indoors. The roof can be too hot to walk on. ""It's very difficult,"" she says. ""We have many sleepless nights."" Shakeela lives with her husband, daughter and three grandchildren in a windowless room in Ahmedabad. They have only a single ceiling fan to keep them cool. Climate change means many cities in India are now hitting 50C. Densely populated, built-up areas are particularly affected by something known as the urban heat island effect. Materials like concrete trap and radiate heat, pushing temperatures higher. And there's no respite at night, when it can actually get hotter. In homes like Shakeela's, temperatures now reach 46C. She gets dizzy in the heat. Her grandchildren suffer from rashes, heat exhaustion and diarrhoea. Traditional methods for staying cool, like drinking buttermilk and lemon water, no longer work. Instead they've borrowed money to paint the roof of their home white. White surfaces reflect more sunlight and a coat of white paint to the roof can bring down temperatures inside by 3-4 degrees. For Shakeela, the difference is huge; the room is cooler and the children sleep better. ""He would not sleep through the afternoon,"" she says, pointing to her sleeping grandson. ""Now he can drift off peacefully."" This video can not be played Watch the full video ""I come from a place of heat,"" Sidi Fadoua says. But the heat in northern Mauritania, in west Africa, it is now too hot for many people to live and work. The heat here is not normal heat, he says. ""It's like fire."" Sidi, 44, lives in a small village close the edge of the Sahara. He works as a salt miner in the nearby flats. The work is tough, and it's become harder as the region heats up due to climate change. ""We can't endure such temperatures,"" he says. ""We are not machines."" To avoid temperatures upwards of 45C in the summer, Sidi has begun to work at night. Job prospects are scarce. Those who once made a living raising livestock can no longer do it - there aren't any plants for the sheep and goats to graze. So like an increasing number of his neighbours, Sidi has plans to migrate to the coastal city of Nouadhibou, where the ocean breeze keeps the city cooler. Locals can hitch a ride there on one of the world's longest trains, taking iron ore from nearby mines to the coast. ""People are moving from here,"" Sidi explains. ""They cannot stand the heat anymore."" The 20-hour ride is dangerous. Locals can sit on top of the carriages where they are exposed to heat and sunlight during the day, before temperatures plummet to near freezing at night. In Nouadhibou, he hopes to find work in the fishing industry. The breeze may bring respite, but with increasing numbers escaping the desert heat, work opportunities are harder to find. Sidi remains hopeful. This video can not be played Watch the full video Patrick Michell, chief of the Kanaka Bar First Nation, first began noticing worrying changes in the forest near his reserve in British Columbia, Canada, more than three decades ago. There was less water in the rivers, and mushrooms had stopped growing. This summer his fears came true. A heatwave was sweeping across North America. On June 29, his home town of Lytton smashed records, reaching 49.6C. The next day, his wife sent him a photo of a thermometer reading 53C. An hour later, his town was on fire. His daughter, Serena, eight months pregnant, scrambled to pack her children and pets into the car: ""We left with the clothes on our backs. The flames were three storeys high and right beside us."" Patrick raced back to see if he could save the house. He'd grown up dealing with wildfires. But like the climate, the fires had changed too. ""These aren't wildfires anymore, they're infernos,"" he says. ""How do you put an inferno out?"" Despite the family's circumstances, Patrick sees what's happened as an opportunity: ""We can rebuild Lytton for the environment that's coming in the next 100 years. It's daunting, but in my heart there's that optimism."" ""When I was a kid the weather was not like this,"" says Joy, who lives in the Niger Delta, in Nigeria. The region is one of the most polluted regions on Earth, and hotter days and nights are increasing. Joy provides for her family by using heat from gas flares to dry tapioca and sell it at a local market. ""I have short hair,"" Joy explains, ""because if I grow my hair long, it could burn my head if the flare shifts direction or explodes."" But the flares are part of the problem. Oil companies use them to burn off gas that is released from the ground when they drill for oil. The flares, which rise 6m (20ft) high, are a significant source of global CO2 emissions, which contribute to climate change. Climate change has had a devastating impact here, turning fertile lands into deserts in the north, while flash flooding has hit the south. People do not remember such extreme weather growing up. ""Most people here aren't well-informed enough to explain why the climate is changing rapidly,"" Joy says. ""But we're suspicious of the non-stop flares."" She wants the government to ban gas flaring, even though she relies on it to provide for her family. Almost none of the oil wealth has been reinvested in Nigeria, where 98 million people live in poverty. This includes Joy and her family. For five days of work they make Â£4 in profit. She is not optimistic about the future. ""I think that life [on Earth] is now coming to an end.""

A retired civil servant in Kuwait, she was concerned by the increasingly severe summer temperatures and worsening dust storms. ""I spoke to some officials. They all said it was impossible to plant anything in the sand,"" she says. ""They said the land was sandy and the temperature was too high. I wanted to do something that would astonish everyone."" Om lives in the Middle East, which is warming faster than much of the world. Kuwait is careering towards unbearable temperatures - it is regularly hotter than 50C. Some predictions suggest average temperatures will rise by 4C by 2050. Yet Kuwait's economy is dominated by fossil fuel exports. The two patches Om planted are modest but they serve a purpose. ""Trees fend off dust, eliminate pollution, clean the air, and lower temperatures,"" she says. Hedgehogs and spiny-tailed lizards now visit the site. ""There's fresh water and shade. It's a beautiful thing."" Some Kuwaitis are now calling for a large-scale green belt to be planted by the government. Their shared hope is that Kuwait is ready to make a stand against the climate crisis. Om says they must protect the land and not let it dry out. ""This heat is not normal,"" Om concludes. ""This is our fathers' land. We must give back to it, because it has given us a lot.""

Bin strikes begin as world leaders arrive for COP26,"Refuse workers and street cleaners are striking for one week A strike by refuse staff and street cleaners in Glasgow has started, as world leaders arrive for the COP26 climate summit. GMB Scotland said members in the city council's cleansing department would be striking for the next week. The union accused the council of failing to give members ""proper time and space"" to consider an offer from local authority body Cosla. Glasgow City Council said the union's decision was ""very disappointing"". They said they would meet with GMB ""at any time"" to resolve the dispute. Bin strikes during COP26 suspended after pay offer Glaswegians greet COP26 with pessimism and hope Rail strike action during COP26 called off Cosla proposed a pay rise of 5.8% for the lowest paid staff as part of a Â£1,062 increase for staff earning below Â£25,000. The deal involved Â£30m from the Scottish government and Â£18.5m from local government. GMB Scotland, Unison and Unite all suspended industrial action on Friday, after the offer was tabled, saying they would consult members. However, on Sunday GMB Scotland confirmed the strike in Glasgow was back on. The union's Drew Duffy told BBC Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that the council was ""constantly goading our members"" and they had decided ""enough was enough and the strike continues"". He explained: ""The workforce are the lowest paid workers in Scotland. There are deep rooted problems within Glasgow City Council. We have been trying to meet with the council. ""It is a constant breakdown of industrial relations, there have been longstanding problems with low pay and discriminatory pay and our members have just had enough. The conditions they work in, the pay they receive is not good enough."" Refuse staff and street cleaners on a picket line outside the Dawsholm Recycling Centre in Glasgow on Monday morning The move by the union came as Glasgow geared up to welcome about 120 world leaders to the city for crucial climate talks at COP26. In a statement released on Monday, a Glasgow City Council spokeswoman said: ""The agreement struck at national level gave two weeks to consider the pay offer and so there is no reason for this strike to go ahead at this time. It is very disappointing the GMB has opted for this course of action. ""We have already agreed their request for time to meet with their members. And, while we remain available to meet with them at any time, we are unable to deliver their request for a pay increase. ""That is part of a national negotiation and a new deal was tabled by Cosla last week. ""It appeared that GMB, along with the other unions, had agreed to suspend the strike until national consultation was complete and it is very disappointing they have reneged on that agreement and have not given us the required 14 days' notice after they publicly announced the suspension on Friday."" The GMB, Unison and Unite had initially called for a Â£2,000 pay rise and previously rejected an Â£850-a-year increase for staff earning up to Â£25,000 from Cosla. Gail Macgregor, Cosla's resources spokeswoman, said they put their ""new and improved"" offer to trade unions last week. ""We were pleased to note that that it was accepted with the expectation that strike action be suspended whilst they presented the new offer to their membership for consideration,"" she added. ""GMB in particular made a public statement that they were suspending strike action for a period of two weeks as of Friday whilst the ballot of their members was conducted nationally across all 32 councils that this affects. ""We very much hope that this remains the case and that all members are given the opportunity to participate whilst essential services are maintained."" The GMB previously denied workers were using the global climate conference as a bargaining chip but said staff had been ""put in a corner"" by Cosla despite their efforts during the pandemic and were ""fed up of being disrespected and undervalued by the government"". The Scottish government said it was not party to the pay negotiations, but said it had made a one-off offer of Â£30m in additional funding to help find a solution. Scottish minister Michael Matheson, speaking to BBC Radio Scotland on Monday, said: ""The GMB locally have entered into a dispute now with GCC which I understand is not to do with the actual package itself but it's the process around being able to engage with their members and discuss that with them. ""I understand that discussions were taking place last night and the Scottish government would want to continue to encourage Cosla, GCC and the GMB to continue to discuss this issue and to try and find a quick resolution to what I believe is a process issue rather than an issue around the deal that was proposed.""

Is the UK on track?,"The UK has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Net zero means a country takes as much of these planet-warming gases - such as carbon dioxide - out of the atmosphere as it puts in. The UK has been relatively successful in cutting its emissions so far. But the government's independent advisers, the Climate Change Committee (CCC), have expressed concerns that the UKcould miss its future targets, owing to ""worryingly slow"" recent progress. And in May 2024 theHigh Court ruledfor the second time in two years that the government would have to redraft its net zero strategy because its existing plan did not provide enough detail about how future targets could be met. What progress is being made? Simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like for you? What is net zero and how are the UK and other countries doing? Since 1990, the UK's carbon emissions from electricity supply havefallen by more than three-quarters.,external This is due to a decline in using fossil fuels - in particular coal - for electricity. In 2023, about 47% of electricity was generated by renewables, such as wind and solar,according to provisional data,external. That is up from 7% in 2010. The government pledged thatall of the UK's electricity would come from low carbon sourcesby 2035. It plans toincrease offshore wind capacity five-fold,externalby 2030,increase solar power capacity five-fold,externalby 2035, andexpand nuclear power,external. However, reports by theCCC,external, theNational Audit Office,externaland across-party group of MPs,externalhave warned that the UK risks missing its 2035 target without clearer planning and much faster action. Where does the UK get its energy and electricity? Despite the push for renewable energy, the government announced in July 2023 that it was granting100 oil and gas production licencesfor the North Sea. The government says it wants to reduce the UK's reliance on imported energy such as gas from ""hostile states"". But the CCC says investing in renewables would be a better way to reduce reliance on imports andbring bills downfor consumers. It says the expansion of fossil fuel production ""is not in line with net zero,external"". North Sea oil and gas claims fact-checked Buildings account forabout 17% of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions,external, mainly due to burning fossil fuels for heating. The government has committed to installing 600,000 electricheat pumpsa year by 2028 to replace gas boilers, but this target is ""significantly off track"",the CCC says,external. In 2023, the Prime Ministerincreased grantsto Â£7,500 to help homeowners in England and Wales install a heat pump. This has led to asurge in applications.,external However, he also said around a fifth of homes would never be required to switch from a fossil fuel boiler. This makes net zero by 2050 ""considerably harder to achieve"", the CCC warned. The UK has some of theleast energy-efficient homes,externalin Europe. Insulation is one of the most effective ways to reduce emissions from housing, by reducing the energy needed for heating. The government has introduced theGreat British Insulation Scheme,externalto help insulate around 300,000 of the poorest-performing homes. But in September 2023, the government cancelled regulations that would have required landlords to improve the energy efficiency of private rented homes. Transport (not including aviation and shipping)accounted for just under a quarter,externalof UK emissions in 2022, making it the largest emitting sector. The government hasdelayed its banon the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030 to 2035, a move which has divided the car industry. But it has set quotas for the percentage of a manufacturer's sales that have to bezero emission, increasing year-on-year to 80% by 2030. This has been welcomed by the CCC. Electric car sales have been faring relatively well,according to the CCC,external. In 2023,16.5% of new car sales were battery electric vehicles,external- up from less than 2% in 2019. Thegovernment wants 300,000 publicly-accessible charging points,externalfor electric cars by 2030, in addition to those in private homes or workplaces. The number of public charging points had increased tomore than 60,000,externalby the end of April 2024 - up by 45% from the previous year- but these are not evenly distributed across the UK. Nearly half of allnew bus registrations,externalwere zero-emission in 2023. The government has committed further funding forregional electric bus schemes,external, but is yet to confirm when it will end the sale of diesel buses. The government aims to remove all diesel-only trains by 2040, butthe CCC argues,externalit needs a clearer plan to achieve this. Overall,the CCC says,externalthere has been ""little progress"" switching to lower carbon modes of travel, such as public transport. Flyingmakes up,externalabout 7% of overall UK emissions, andshipping about,external3%. The UK hasa strategy,externalfor delivering net zero aviation by 2050. It has been criticised forrelying too muchon technologies such as cleaner fuels and zero emissions aircraft that are unlikely to be widely available anytime soon. As a result,the CCC says,externalthat the government should be looking at how to manage demand rather than allowing it to grow - for example addressing private jet use and providing lower cost rail travel. In April 2024 the government announceda target for 10% of jet fuel to come from ""sustainable sources"",externalby 2030. Progress has also been slow to establish a strategy to decarbonise shipping,the CCC says,external. Agriculture and the way land is usedproduce 11%,externalof the UK's greenhouse gas emissions. The government released its food strategy in June 2022, but theCCC said,externalit failed to deliver action to drive down emissions from agriculture at the required scale or pace. It has also been criticised fornot doing moreto encourage a switch to a more sustainable diet - eating more plant-based food, for example. Meat consumption in the UKhas been fallingthough - down 17% in the decade to 2019. In February 2023, the governmentreleased details,externalof its long-awaited environmental land management schemes for England, replacing the EU common agricultural policy. The schemes mean farmers can apply for public money to support activities that benefit the environment. What's your diet's carbon footprint? Trees and peatlandsplay important roles,externalin removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. UKforest cover,externalis 13%,among the lowest,externalin Europe. The government has atarget to plant,external30,000 hectares of trees a year by 2025. However, annual UK tree planting hasnot risen above,external15,000 hectares since 2001. TheUK forestry body has warnedthat there is ""zero chance"" of the UK meeting its target. It is estimated thatonly around 20% of UK peatlands are in a near-natural state,external, including only 1.3% in England. These damaged peatlandsare responsible for around 5%of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions, whereas healthy peatlands would take up CO2. The government aims to restore around 29,000 hectares of peatland a year across England, Scotland and Wales by 2025. But current levels areless than half this,external, leaving the target ""significantly off track"", the CCC says. Hydrogen is a low-carbon fuel that could be used for transport, heating, power generation or energy storage. Thegovernment considers,externalhydrogen to be a critical part of future energy security and decarbonisation. Itwants to have,externala 10GW hydrogen production capacity by 2030. The industry is very much in its infancy, andthe government admits,externalit will need ""rapid and significant scale-up"" in the coming years. It has announced aseries of projects and incentives for investment,external. The government has promised a decision on the role of hydrogen in heating in 2026, buthad to cancel a proposed trialbecause the main source of hydrogen supply was not ready. The government sees technologies to capture the CO2 produced by power stations and industrial processes as a key part of its net zero strategy. It aims to capture and storebetween 20 and 30 million tonnes of CO2 a year,externalby 2030. In March 2023, the Chancellor pledged Â£20bn in investment in carbon capture over the next 20 years, andseveral projects have been announced,externalaround the UK. But the technology is still emerging, is expensive, and can only capture a portion of emissions. What is carbon capture and can it fight climate change? Industrial emissionsrepresent about 14%,externalof the UK's total. The government aims to cut emissions from manufacturing by about two thirds by 2035. It hasa scheme to cap the amount of emissions,externalallowed by individual sectors each year, reducing that amount over time. But the scheme risks companies shifting production to other countries.

Barclays boss in shock exit over Epstein inquiry,"Barclays boss Jes Staley is ""shell-shocked, angry and upset"" at the conclusion of a probe into his links to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein which has led to his sudden exit from the bank. Insiders close to Mr Staley said he was surprised by City regulators' findings. They have been investigating if Mr Staley's links with the dead financier were closer than first thought. Barclays said it had been made aware of the conclusions of the probe and ""Mr Staley's intention to contest them"". At the heart of Mr Staley's departure is apparently a perceived inconsistency between his account to his own board of his relationship with Epstein and evidence seen by the regulators. Mr Staley insists that while Epstein was an important client of JP Morgan, where Mr Staley worked for a number of years and as such they were in contact regularly, their dealings were well within the grounds that could be described as professional. The BBC understands the regulator took the view that the volume and tone of the emails between the two suggested a closer relationship than the purely professional. But Barclays has stated that the report makes no findings that Mr Staley saw, or was aware of, any of Epstein's crimes. The relationship between a US high net worth individual and his private banker is not like your average relationship with the bank manager. In fact, it would be quite odd if Mr Staley had not visited Epstein at home or indeed vice versa. Nevertheless, the board of Barclays clearly felt that the perceived disconnect between the accounts of the relationship would mean an extended and distracting wrangle with the regulator. Having accepted Mr Staley's promise that he had been totally transparent about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, the board described itself as ""disappointed"", but accepted that it would not be possible for Mr Staley to run the bank while being in open dispute with the regulator. This is not the first time the board of Barclays has been blindsided by Mr Staley. In 2018, he was fined Â£642,000 and Barclays Â£15m after Mr Staley took it upon himself to instruct the bank's own security unit to track down a whistleblower who had raised concerns about the suitability of the appointment of a former colleague of the chief executive. That could have been a straight red card but he escaped with a yellow. The board will also be disappointed because Mr Staley's strategy for the bank seemed to be paying off.  He saw off an activist shareholder challenge to split the investment and retail banks, the investment bank had started delivering good returns and the profits were beating analyst estimates. But ultimately, boards don't like surprises - particularly ones that are perceived to tarnish a reputation and culture they have spent many years trying to rehabilitate. Regulators began investigating the Barclays boss after getting a cache of emails between the men from Mr Staley's former employer. Before joining Barclays the married father-of-two was an executive at US bank JP Morgan, where Epstein, who took his own life in 2019 while in prison, was already a client. Over many years, Epstein, who was convicted of trafficking a minor for prostitution in 2008 and served 13 months in custody, cultivated contact with the rich and powerful, including former US presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump. Who was Jeffrey Epstein? Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates has spoken of his ""huge mistake"" in spending time with Epstein, while the equally super-rich Leon Black stood down from US private equity firm Apollo Global Management over his links. Although Mr Staley, 63, has characterised his relationship with Epstein as professional, with contact starting to ""taper off"" from about 2013, regulators wanted to know whether the emails pointed to a friendlier connection. Mr Staley had already admitted he maintained contact with Epstein for about seven years after his 2008 conviction. And it is also known Mr Staley visited Little St James, a retreat owned by Epstein in the US Virgin Islands in 2015, months before taking the top job at Barclays. In fairness to Mr Staley, he is not the only boss of Barclays to have fallen from grace in recent times. In fact, he is the bank's fifth chief executive in seven years - following in the footsteps of men such asBob Diamond, who resigned over an interest rate-rigging scandal, andAntony Jenkins, who was sacked after falling out with the board over the bank's cost-cutting and profitability. During the pandemic, Mr Staley spoke out against the culture of working from home, saying it was ""not sustainable"". At a virtual meeting of the World Economic Forum, he said: ""It will increasingly be a challenge to maintain the culture and collaboration that these large financial institutions seek to have and should have."" Now Barclays faces the task of maintaining its culture without him - and he may prove a hard act to follow. Read more about Mr Staley here. Mr Staley said last year: ""Obviously I thought I knew him well and I didn't. For sure, with hindsight with what we know now, I deeply regret having any relationship with Jeffrey."" He has yet to comment publicly on Monday's news, but Reuters reported it had seen an internal memo from him indicating he did not want plans to contest the investigation's findings to be a distraction. ""Although I will not be with you for the next chapter of Barclays' story, know that I will be cheering your success from the sidelines,"" the memo reportedly said. Barclays said in a announcement on Monday,externalthat it was ""made aware on Friday evening of the preliminary conclusions from the FCA and the PRA of their investigation into Mr Staley's characterisation to Barclays of his relationship with the late Mr Jeffrey Epstein and the subsequent description of that relationship in Barclays' response to the FCA"". ""In view of those conclusions, and Mr Staley's intention to contest them, the board and Mr Staley have agreed that he will step down. ""It should be noted that the investigation makes no findings that Mr Staley saw, or was aware of, any of Epstein's alleged crimes, which was the central question underpinning Barclays' support for Mr Staley following the arrest of Mr Epstein in the summer of 2019."" Jes Staley visited Little St James, an island own by Jeffrey Epstein, months before he started at Barclays Barclays praised Mr Staley's success at the bank, but added that ""the regulatory process had still to run its full course and it was not appropriate for Barclays to comment further on the preliminary conclusions"". The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) announced an investigation last year into Mr Staley's ""characterisation to the company of his relationship"" with Epstein. Barclays said last year that following Epstein's death in 2019, Mr Staley had ""volunteered and gave to certain executives, and the chairman, an explanation of his relationship with Mr Epstein"". Jeffrey Epstein died in a New York prison cell in 2019 The probe's conclusions are yet to be made public, but Hargreaves Lansdown's senior investment analyst Susannah Streeter said it seems clear they are critical of Mr Staley. ""Although detail is limited, it appears regulators believe there was a distinct lack of transparency over this relationship,"" she said. ""It's understood Mr Staley will contest the conclusions, and clearly the board want to distance Barclays from what could be a long drawn out process."" Mr Staley has faced regulatory scrutiny before during his six years at Barclays. In 2018, he was fined Â£642,430 by the FCA and PRAfor trying to unmask a whistleblowerwho had raised concerns about a senior executive appointment at the bank's US operation. Many commentators thought the chief executive was lucky to stay in his job. Under the terms of his contract with Barclays, Mr Staley will receive 12 months' pay, totalling Â£2.4m, as well as his pension allowance of Â£120,000 for the year, and any other benefits. He will be replaced as chief executive by Mr C.S. Venkatakrishnan, known as Venkat, subject to regulatory approval. The board said Venkat had been identified as its preferred candidate for the role over a year ago. Reuters said it had seen another internal memo, from Venkat, telling staff Mr Staley's strategy at Barclays was the ""right one"", although he added he would announce changes to the organisation in the coming days. In a statement, the FCA and PRA said they ""do not comment on ongoing investigations or regulatory proceedings beyond confirming the regulatory actions as detailed in the firm's announcement"".

"Climate at one minute to midnight, says Johnson","This video can not be played PM confirms he is not in favour of new UK coal mine The world is at ""one minute to midnight"", having run down the clock on waiting to combat climate change, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. He was speaking as world leaders arrived for the landmark COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Johnson said leaders needed to move from ""aspiration to action"" to slow global warming. He added the summit was a ""critical"" moment for him, and said an ambitious outcome was still ""in the balance"". For the first time, Mr Johnson also confirmed he did not want to see acontroversial proposed coal mine in Cumbriago ahead. ""I'm not in favour of more coal,"" said the prime minister. ""But it is not a decision for me, it is a decision for the planning authorities."" The government has been criticised for not stopping the mine project going ahead. This is the strongest statement the prime minister has yet made on the subject - and could help negotiations, because persuading nations to phase out coal is one of the central goals the UK government has set for the crucial UN conference. LIVE: Latest updates from COP26 Why the battle for British coal matters to the world The UK is hosting the summit amid mounting concern among scientists that countries are not doing enough to limit the emissions of greenhouse gases, which have caused average global temperatures to rise. The 2015 Paris climate conference called for average temperatures to rise by well below 2C, and preferably only 1.5C, when compared to pre-industrial averages. World leadersarrived at the venuein Glasgow -which has officially become United Nations territory- for the official opening on Monday. Later, they will make statements setting out what their countries are doing on climate change. As UN territory, the venue is being patrolled by armed UN officers and Police Scotland is only allowed to enter if they are invited by the UN secretary general - or if they believe there is a threat to life. Tap or click to go through the gallery  On BBC Breakfast on Monday, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss was asked whether it was necessary for world leaders to fly to the conference - as estimates suggested 400 private planeshad flown into Glasgow. She replied that it was ""fantastic"" that world leaders were there in person. ""When you really get into crunch negotiations, when you want to look somebody in the eye and talk to them face to face, you do need to meet in person,"" she said. ""World leaders are going to have to make some tough decisionsâ¦ they're going to have to commit to things they didn't necessarily want to when they arrived at the conference. That's why it's really important we do have people face to face."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she understood that the air travel involved may send a ""mixed message"" - but agreed that more progress is made when leaders meet in person. ""Given all of the travel required to get here, it even further increases the pressure on the shoulders of world leaders to make sure it's worth it,"" she said. Ms Sturgeon added that the goal of the conference was to increase countries' ambitions to reduce emissions. ""Right now, the commitments countries have made wouldn't even limit [global warming] to 2C, let alone 1.5."" Planespotters said COP26 was a ""once-in-a-lifetime"" opportunity to spot aircraft not normally seen in Scotland The COP26 summit immediately followed a G20 meeting in Rome - made up of leaders of 20 of the world's biggest economies - whichended on a downbeat note from Mr Johnson,after only 12 of the 20 committed to be carbon neutral by 2050. Speaking to the BBC separately, Mr Johnson promised to add Â£1bn to the money the government has earmarked over the next four years to help developing countries. The government has already conceded that the developed world would not deliver in full on a promise made in 2009 to pay poorer countries $100bn a year to help tackle climate change - roughly equivalent to Â£73bn based on current exchange rates. The government has also been criticised for cutting foreign aid this year. Mr Johnson urged other developed nations to commit more cash. He said the other two central goals of the conference would be persuading world leaders to commit to accelerating the transition away from petrol and diesel cars and to stop deforestation. Climate change is one of the world's most pressing problems.Governments must promise more ambitious cuts in warming gases if we are to prevent greater global temperature rises. The summit in Glasgow is where change could happen.You need to watch for the promises made by the world's biggest polluters, like the US and China, and whether poorer countries are getting the support they need. All our lives will change.Decisions made here could impact our jobs, how we heat our homes, what we eat and how we travel. Read more about the COP26 summit here. Mr Johnson also defended the decision inlast week's Budgetto cut the duty on short-haul internal flights by 50%. He described it as a difficult decision, adding: ""Even the distinguished Scottish politicians who are beating me up about this don't actually themselves come to London by any other means."" The comment appears to be a criticism of the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford. Mr Blackford branded the cut in passenger duty a ""disgrace"" and claimed it was evidence the government did ""not understand the climate challenge"". Mr Johnson told the BBC that drawing more private finance into low carbon investments would be crucial to ensuring a rapid reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Governments can bring billions to the table, he said, but the market has ""hundreds of trillions"". When asked what the Johnson household was doing to cut its carbon footprint, the prime minister joked that he had ""totally abolished commuting"" when he moved into No 10 and started living above his place of work. He declined to say whether he had cut beef out of his diet, adding he had ""got to start eating a lot less of all kinds of things"". Mr Johnson would not confirm whether he now regarded himself as an environmentalist, but insisted he was ""not the black sheep of my family"" on green issues. Boris Johnson's wife Carrie, his father Stanley and his brother Leo are all very keen environmentalists. The Archbishop of Canterbury said climate change was ""absolutely a moral issue"". ""This is our neighbours all around the world, those who are already suffering catastrophic impacts,"" Justin Welby told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""This is life or death."" Mr Welby - who used to work in an oil executive - said he did not regret working in the industry as he ""learnt a huge amount from it"", and added the vast majority of people in the industry are ""pretty passionate about changing"". Additional reporting by Francesca Gillett The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

"Bin strikes begin as world leaders arrive for COP26Glasgow City Council says the GMB union's week-long walk out is ""very disappointing"".","Refuse workers and street cleaners are striking for one week A strike by refuse staff and street cleaners in Glasgow has started, as world leaders arrive for the COP26 climate summit. GMB Scotland said members in the city council's cleansing department would be striking for the next week. The union accused the council of failing to give members ""proper time and space"" to consider an offer from local authority body Cosla. Glasgow City Council said the union's decision was ""very disappointing"". They said they would meet with GMB ""at any time"" to resolve the dispute. Bin strikes during COP26 suspended after pay offer Glaswegians greet COP26 with pessimism and hope Rail strike action during COP26 called off Cosla proposed a pay rise of 5.8% for the lowest paid staff as part of a Â£1,062 increase for staff earning below Â£25,000. The deal involved Â£30m from the Scottish government and Â£18.5m from local government. GMB Scotland, Unison and Unite all suspended industrial action on Friday, after the offer was tabled, saying they would consult members. However, on Sunday GMB Scotland confirmed the strike in Glasgow was back on. The union's Drew Duffy told BBC Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that the council was ""constantly goading our members"" and they had decided ""enough was enough and the strike continues"". He explained: ""The workforce are the lowest paid workers in Scotland. There are deep rooted problems within Glasgow City Council. We have been trying to meet with the council. ""It is a constant breakdown of industrial relations, there have been longstanding problems with low pay and discriminatory pay and our members have just had enough. The conditions they work in, the pay they receive is not good enough."" Refuse staff and street cleaners on a picket line outside the Dawsholm Recycling Centre in Glasgow on Monday morning The move by the union came as Glasgow geared up to welcome about 120 world leaders to the city for crucial climate talks at COP26. In a statement released on Monday, a Glasgow City Council spokeswoman said: ""The agreement struck at national level gave two weeks to consider the pay offer and so there is no reason for this strike to go ahead at this time. It is very disappointing the GMB has opted for this course of action. ""We have already agreed their request for time to meet with their members. And, while we remain available to meet with them at any time, we are unable to deliver their request for a pay increase. ""That is part of a national negotiation and a new deal was tabled by Cosla last week. ""It appeared that GMB, along with the other unions, had agreed to suspend the strike until national consultation was complete and it is very disappointing they have reneged on that agreement and have not given us the required 14 days' notice after they publicly announced the suspension on Friday."" The GMB, Unison and Unite had initially called for a Â£2,000 pay rise and previously rejected an Â£850-a-year increase for staff earning up to Â£25,000 from Cosla. Gail Macgregor, Cosla's resources spokeswoman, said they put their ""new and improved"" offer to trade unions last week. ""We were pleased to note that that it was accepted with the expectation that strike action be suspended whilst they presented the new offer to their membership for consideration,"" she added. ""GMB in particular made a public statement that they were suspending strike action for a period of two weeks as of Friday whilst the ballot of their members was conducted nationally across all 32 councils that this affects. ""We very much hope that this remains the case and that all members are given the opportunity to participate whilst essential services are maintained."" The GMB previously denied workers were using the global climate conference as a bargaining chip but said staff had been ""put in a corner"" by Cosla despite their efforts during the pandemic and were ""fed up of being disrespected and undervalued by the government"". The Scottish government said it was not party to the pay negotiations, but said it had made a one-off offer of Â£30m in additional funding to help find a solution. Scottish minister Michael Matheson, speaking to BBC Radio Scotland on Monday, said: ""The GMB locally have entered into a dispute now with GCC which I understand is not to do with the actual package itself but it's the process around being able to engage with their members and discuss that with them. ""I understand that discussions were taking place last night and the Scottish government would want to continue to encourage Cosla, GCC and the GMB to continue to discuss this issue and to try and find a quick resolution to what I believe is a process issue rather than an issue around the deal that was proposed.""

LiveLiveLeaders under pressure to avoid climate catastrophe,"The Queen urges world leaders to ""achieve true statesmanship"" and create a ""safer, stabler future"" for the planet She says in a video message they should ""rise above the politics of the moment"" as they meet at COP26 in Glasgow The climate change conference's first major deal is struck as a group of world leaders promise to stop deforestation by 2030 Meanwhile, India pledges a net zero target for 2070 - 20 years later than the summit target set by Boris Johnson Separately, China also fails to make any new major commitments on climate change at the conference Naturalist David Attenborough says carbon emissions must be halved this decade to keep warming limited to 1.5C by the end of the century Under present targets we are on track for warming of 2.7C by 2100 - which the UN says would result in ""climate catastrophe"" Edited by George Bowden World Leaders pose for a group photo at an evening reception for COP26 We're pausing our live page after Day 2 of COP26. Before we go, here's a quick look back at the highlights:  We'll be back tomorrow at 08:00GMT for Day 3. There will be more speeches from world leaders as well as a special focus on deforestation. We'll be looking out for an announcement of a new deal on forests - crucial to keeping global heating to 1.5C. Today's live coverage has been brought to you by Paul McLaren, George Bowden, Emma Harrison, Doug Faulkner, Gary Kitchener, James Clarke, Joseph Lee, Holly Honderich, George Wright, Robert Greenall and Kevin Ponniah. The BBC Climate Change Debate has ended. MÃºte Bourup Egede, prime minister of Greenland, finished the debate by saying he wanted to ""push all the countries - especially big countries with big economies - to collaborate with all of the countries in the world to invest in green energy"". ""This is for the future."" Reality Check Gina McCarthy, a climate adviser for the White House, said the US was âquadrupling its commitmentsâ on climate aid. In April, President Joe Biden said he would double funding to developing nations to tackle climate change. Then, in September at the UN General Assembly, he said he would âwork with the Congress to double that number againâ â quadrupling former President Obamaâs commitment. These figures are relative to Mr Obamaâs spending, not that of his immediate predecessor, because former President Donald Trump mostly withdrew from the USâs international commitments. But Mr Biden hasnât yet managed to pass his budget in Congress, which has the power to make laws. So that commitment is not set in stone yet. Read more about what the biggest polluters are doing to tackle climate change. Reality Check âOne of the things that government is trying to do is to incentivise through grants, the acquisition of these [electric] cars,â said Kwasi Kwarteng, UK Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. The UK government offers a grant of Â£2,500 to those looking to buy an electric car. However, the government has reduced the grant size over the past few years. The maximum grant started off at Â£5,000 in 2011, dropped to Â£4,500 in 2016, then Â£3,500 in 2018 and Â£3,000 in 2020 before being reduced to its current level. As well as the new reduced amount, the Department for Transport has also narrowed the eligibility criteria - restricting the grant for cars costing below Â£35,000. The move was heavily criticised by industry groups and car manufacturers who called it ""disappointing"". Read more about the move to electric cars. Colombia's Minister for Mining & Energy, Diego Mesa, says that there are still about 500,000 families in Colombia without access to electricity. ""We have one billion people around the world with no access to electricity who need to use wood to cook which impacts on deforestation â we have to fix that as well."" Reality Check Colombiaâs Minister of Energy and Mining, Diego Mesa, said carbon capture could help on the path to net zero. âThe problem is not the source of energy, the problem is emissions,"" he said. This is the idea that instead of drastically reducing the amount of carbon dioxide we emit, we could at least partially rely on technology to remove carbon dioxide thatâs already been emitted and store it or use it for energy. Some of these technologies do already exist but they would have to be scaled up enormously to make a dent â at great expense. Some of these processes themselves use a lot of energy to separate the carbon dioxide. And there are scientists who fear the promise of carbon capture technology might act as a âblank chequeâ for people to keep polluting at the same rate, in the so-far untested belief the damage can be reversed at some point in the future. Asked about the new Cambo oilfield to the west of the Shetland Islands, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng is booed as he says that the UK government will not rule out granting a licence for operations. He says he wonât shut the door on a quarter of a million jobs and that the climate change debate is about transition. ""It's a licence that was granted 20 years ago and it's a planning decision that we're going to examine. That's all I'm going to say about that,"" Kwarteng says, to loud boos. ""I can't simply say to the quarter of a million people who work in the sector in the UK that we're going to just close the door on the sector,"" he adds.  White House National Climate Advisor, Gina McCarthy, says that weâre being asked by young people to stop destroying the planet. President Biden is investing $550bn to grow the economy ""not to sacrifice it,"" she says. ""These are investments not penalties, and as soon as China and Brazil figure out that they are on the losing end of the proposition â theyâll be running to catch up."" Gina McCarthy is asked about criticism of President Joe Biden's huge motorcade at COP26. Kirsty Wark points out that the US motorcade was more than 80 vehicles long during a recent Biden visit to the Vatican. âWe have to make change but itâs going to take more than looking at whether or not its a big motorcade,"" McCarthy responds. More now from the BBC's Big Global Climate Debate, under way on BBC One. White House National Climate Advisor, Gina McCarthy, says that Russia and China should be at COP26. But she says that doesn't mean we should allow them to ""decide the fate of the world"". ""We should show them they are missing out if they do not join us and take action"" McCarthy says. ""I'm disappointed they are not here but they should not be allowed to dictate the lack of action. They canât dictate the lack of action. Science is telling us what to do and weâre here to get it done."" In the past half hour it's been confirmed that leaders from more than 100 countrieswill sign an agreement to end deforestation by 2030- providing funds to support and
restore forests. But what do experts think of the first major deal from COP26? Prof Simon Lewis at University College London, an expert in
climate and forests, says: âIt is good news
to have a political commitment to end deforestation from so many countries, and
significant funding to move forward on that journey."" ""That indigenous peoples are finally being acknowledged as key protectors of forests is particularly welcome, alongside additional funding for rainforest nations and obligations on consumer countries and companies to clean up their supply chains. Prof Simon Lewis, University College London He adds: âThe real weakness is a failure to tackle growing demand for products grown on rainforest land. But that would mean tackling high levels of meat consumption in places like the UK and US, and Boris Johnson has no appetite for that, so canât convene world leaders around that critical aspect of stopping deforestation.â And Chatham House Executive Director Sustainability and author of Rethinking the Amazonian Jungle, Ana Jung, called the announcement an important building block for COP26 success but says details will be key. The BBC's Big Global Climate Debate is now under way for viewers in the UK on BBC One, the iPlayer and by clicking the play button at the top of this page. We will be bringing you the biggest updates from the debate live here. Sitting on the panel are: A group of leaders at COP26 will sign the climate change conference's first major deal on Tuesday when they promise to stop deforestation by 2030. Signatories will include Brazil, where large parts of the Amazon rainforest have been cut down, and Indonesia, the world's largest exporter of palm oil. Felling trees contributes to climate change because it depletes forests that absorb vast amounts of the warming gas CO2. More money is also being promised to protect and restore forests.
More than 100 countries say they will sign the deal, covering about 85% of the world's forests. And governments of 28 countries will commit to remove deforestation from the global trade of food and other agricultural products such as palm oil, soya and cocoa. To stop deforestation and break the link between tree loss and agriculture, almost Â£14 billion ($19.2 billion) of public and private funding is being pledged. Some of this will go to developing countries to restore damaged land, tackle wildfire and support indigenous communities. Read morehere.

Viewers in the UK can watch the programme on BBC One, the BBC iPlayer and by clicking the play button at the top of this page. A panel of leading international political figures has come together to take questions from young people in the studio in Glasgow - and around
the world - on the challenges presented by climate change. Presented by Kirsty Wark, the debate gives young people across the world the chance to hold their leaders to account
on action for climate change. Hilda Flavia Nakabuye, 24, is a climate change activist from Kampala, the Ugandan capital. Her activism was prompted by the impact of climate change on her family's lives, as she explains here: ""When I was still young I had a plantation with my family, but we lost it due to the effects of climate change. Heavy rains, floods, strong winds, unpredictable seasons, dry streams, all these things. ""In 2017 I joined a discussion at my school that was about climate change. I then understood that the effects my family were feeling was because of climate change. ""I started to speak up as a climate activist and as a campaigner. We travelled to schools and communities and in 2019 I started the Fridays For Future movement in Uganda. Now we have a network of 53,000. ""We were arrested a few times by the police because of the climate strikes - they alleged we might be a political party. ""I have very little hope in COP26 because I haven't seen any concrete actions being taken in the last 25 COPs. Many people are being under-represented, especially from the most affected countries, mostly from the global south. ""We are quickly losing our hope in the leaders because of their inaction. Our survival and the survival of the future generations depend on our actions today. ""Itâs either we come up with concrete actions or we fail all generations to come."" Reality Check Indiaâs Prime Minister Narendra Modi has long resisted setting a
date for his country to achieve net zero -  balancing out greenhouse gas emissions with measures to remove them from the
atmosphere. On Monday, he said India would now achieve this by 2070. This is a significantly longer timescale than the UK, EU and the US which have set targets of 2050 to reach this goal. It is also a decade later than Chinaâs 2060 target. Modi also said India would aim to supply 50% of all its
energy requirements from renewable sources by 2030 with a non-fossil fuel
generating capacity of 500 gigawatts (GW). India currently generates a
little over 100GW from non-fossil sources and is unlikely to hit an earlier target
of 175 gigawatts by 2022. Although India has expanded its
capacity to generate power from sources such as wind and solar, it still relies
heavily on coal. It currently powers about 70% of the countryâs electricity
grid. You can read morehereabout India's climate challenge. Prince Charles has been having a busy day at the COP26 summit and appeared to be in good spirits this evening as Boris Johnson praised his environmental efforts over the years. The Prince of Wales spoke to the assembled world leaders this afternoon before a visit to a distillery run by a former drug addict who had been helped by the Prince's Trust charity. Ryan Longmuir, who started Regis Banqueting 18 years ago after receiving a Â£5,000 loan from the charity, handed the prince a glass of whisky and said ""it's great meeting him"". Charles then joined other royals and some of the political leaders ata dinner reception at Glasgow's Kelvingrove Museum. The prince was again seen being handed a drink and this time, Reuters reports, he joked: ""I think I need it after today."" He may have been referring to a moment when he briefly lost his footing as he made his way to the stage to deliver this speech earlier in the day. But one man who apparently didn't think the prince had had a bad day was the UK prime minister. Our political editorLaura Kuenssberg has tweeted,externalthat Boris Johnson complimented the Prince of Wales at the reception, saying: âYou heard me earlier on say this was a job for James Bond. Well we have somebody who drives an electric Aston Martin who has a plan to defuse the ticking time bomb. ""l just want to say you're a prophet without honour and you've been right for a very long time."" Outgoing German Chancellor Angela Merkel said earlier that a comprehensive transformation in ways of working is needed to cut CO2 emissions - and not just action from governments. ""That's why I want to make a clear plea here for carbon pricing. This already exists within the EU and also in China, for example,"" she says. Carbon pricing - effectively a tax on CO2 emissions - has been called for in some industries,such as shipping, as a means of forcing polluting businesses to clean up their trade. Merkel said it would be a way to ensure industries and businesses had an incentive to develop technology that would be better for the global climate. That's a very clear expression of what we need to do in a decisive decade, she said. ""Then we will know how to best arrange CO2-free mobility, CO2-free industry and CO2-free processes of our life."" One of the ways we can reduce our carbon footprint is through what we eat. Switching to a plant-based diet can help fight climate change, according to a major report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),which says the West's high consumption of meat and dairy is fuelling global warming. If youâre eating beef three to five times a week, over an entire year your consumption is contributing 1,611kg to your annual greenhouse gas emissions. That's the equivalent of driving a regular petrol car 4,112 miles (6,618km), or taking five return flights from London to Malaga. Many are already taking note of this. Daily meat consumption in the UK has fallen by 17% in the past decade,a study has shown.

As the day draws to a close in Glasgow, US President Joe Biden says on Twitter that he hopes those present at the summit ""meet the moment on climate, and kick off a decade of ambition, action, and innovation to preserve our shared future"". ""There's no substitute for face-to-face diplomacy,"" he writes. Biden is among 25,000 delegates from about 200 countries - and from every region in the world - in Glasgow this week, gathered to share plans for how they will cut emissions by 2030. The much-anticipated United Nations gathering is one of the biggest summits the UK has ever hosted. Over two weeks, we can expect a flurry of announcements from countries promising to curb emissions, like switches to electric cars or an expedited phase-out of coal. By the end of the conference, some form of declaration is expected, with every country required to sign on. Â© 2025 BBC.

"What action are the biggest carbon polluters taking?Life where it's too hot to work, too hot to sleep","Just four countries plus the European Union are responsible for most of the world's emissions of carbon dioxide (CO2), which is the most common greenhouse gas responsible for global warming. All five signed up tothe Paris agreementin 2015 to cut emissions to limit global temperature rises. What steps have they taken since? Says carbon emissions will peak before 2030 Aiming for 25% of energy from non-fossil fuels by 2030 Promises to be carbon neutral before 2060 Carbon neutrality refers to the balancing of overall carbon emissions with measures to absorb it from the atmosphere such as the planting of trees. China is the largest producer of CO2, and its carbon emissions are still rising, largely because of a reliance on coal. Last month, President Xi Jinping announced it wouldstop funding new coal-fired projects overseas. But at home, coal mines have been ordered to ramp up production to meet surging energy demand, although Beijing has promised to cut back on coal use from 2026. China now accounts for more than a third of all global solar power and is the world's biggest producer of wind energy. But it needs to cut demand for coal by more than 80% by 2060 to meet its climate goals, according to the International Energy Agency. Climate Action Tracker,externalsays it's not clear if its net zero plan is for just CO2 or all greenhouse gases. And it rates its policies and actions as ""insufficient,"" and not consistent with the Paris Agreement goal of keeping to a 1.5C increase in global temperatures. China has not joined a pledge made at the climate summit by more than 100 countries to reduce emissions of another greenhouse gas, methane, by 30% by 2030. However, in ajoint action plan with the United States, China has promised to develop a ""National Action Plan"" to address the issue of methane emissions. Will cut CO2 by at least 50% of 2005 level by 2030 Wants half of new vehicles to be electric by 2030 Promises to be carbon neutral by 2050 More than 80% of US energy comes from fossil fuels, although renewable energy sources are on the increase. President Joe Biden's environmental plan looks to expand green energy further, with a $150bn (Â£100bn) clean-electricity programme to reward utility companies switching from fossil fuels. The US has also pledged ""100% carbon pollution-free"" electricity by 2035 - a commitment made in its joint statement with China at the COP26 summit. CO2 emissions have been dropping over the past decade. But Climate Action Tracker says US actions and policies are ""insufficient"", and need ""substantial improvement"" to beconsistent with the Paris Agreement.,external Promises a 55% emissions cut from the 1990 level by 2030 Aiming for 40% of energy from renewables by 2030 Will be carbon neutral by 2050 The top CO2 emitters in the EU are Germany, Italy and Poland. And while it has overall emissions targets, EU states have differing financial and technical capabilities. But all member countries need to agree how they reach the bloc's targets, as the EU negotiates as a single entity when it comes to the 2021 United Nations Climate Change Conference (Cop26). Climate Action Tracker says its policies and actions are ""almost sufficient"" to keep the global temperature rise to less than 2C, noting emissions have been falling since 2018. Aiming for a 45% reduction in 'emissions intensity' by 2030 Promises 50% of electricity capacity from non-fossil fuels by 2030 Pledging to reach net zero by 2070 India's annual CO2 emissions have risen steadily in the past two decades - but it produces the lowest emissions per person among the top five. India has argued the wealthier, more industrialised nations should bear more of the burden, as they have contributed far more to global warming over time. It has a target for cutting ""emissions intensity"" - CO2 per unit of economic growth - saying this is a fairer way to compare with other countries. India has announced a target date for net zero of 2070 - later than other major emitters. It has also promised a significant increase in energy production from non-fossil fuel sources such as wind, solar and hydro power - and by 2019, this had reached 23%. Butabout 70% of India's electricity grid is powered by coal,external. And India has not joined the methane emissions reduction initiative unveiled at COP26. Climate Action Tracker says the country needs to phase out coal power generation before 2040 and boost its target for energy derived from non-fossil fuels. India is also a major methane emitter, but it has not joined the global pledge to cut emissions by 2030. Will cut emissions by 30% from 1990 levels by 2030 Promises to be carbon neutral by 2060 After the collapse of the Soviet Union, in 1991, Russia's economy - and its carbon emissions - shrank anyway. But Russia is still relying on its extensive forests and swamps to absorb carbon. Climate Action Tracker notes that for the COP26 conference,Russia had not updated its targets since the 2015 Paris Agreement.,external Non-fossil fuel sources make up only a small proportion of its total energy mix. It's also a major emitter of methane, but has not joined in the emissions cut pledge made at the climate summit.

Is the UK on track to meet its targets?,"The UK has pledged to reduce its greenhouse gas emissions to net zero by 2050. Net zero means a country takes as much of these planet-warming gases - such as carbon dioxide - out of the atmosphere as it puts in. The UK has been relatively successful in cutting its emissions so far. But the government's independent advisers, the Climate Change Committee (CCC), have expressed concerns that the UKcould miss its future targets, owing to ""worryingly slow"" recent progress. And in May 2024 theHigh Court ruledfor the second time in two years that the government would have to redraft its net zero strategy because its existing plan did not provide enough detail about how future targets could be met. What progress is being made? Simple guide to climate change What will climate change look like for you? What is net zero and how are the UK and other countries doing? Since 1990, the UK's carbon emissions from electricity supply havefallen by more than three-quarters.,external This is due to a decline in using fossil fuels - in particular coal - for electricity. In 2023, about 47% of electricity was generated by renewables, such as wind and solar,according to provisional data,external. That is up from 7% in 2010. The government pledged thatall of the UK's electricity would come from low carbon sourcesby 2035. It plans toincrease offshore wind capacity five-fold,externalby 2030,increase solar power capacity five-fold,externalby 2035, andexpand nuclear power,external. However, reports by theCCC,external, theNational Audit Office,externaland across-party group of MPs,externalhave warned that the UK risks missing its 2035 target without clearer planning and much faster action. Where does the UK get its energy and electricity? Despite the push for renewable energy, the government announced in July 2023 that it was granting100 oil and gas production licencesfor the North Sea. The government says it wants to reduce the UK's reliance on imported energy such as gas from ""hostile states"". But the CCC says investing in renewables would be a better way to reduce reliance on imports andbring bills downfor consumers. It says the expansion of fossil fuel production ""is not in line with net zero,external"". North Sea oil and gas claims fact-checked Buildings account forabout 17% of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions,external, mainly due to burning fossil fuels for heating. The government has committed to installing 600,000 electricheat pumpsa year by 2028 to replace gas boilers, but this target is ""significantly off track"",the CCC says,external. In 2023, the Prime Ministerincreased grantsto Â£7,500 to help homeowners in England and Wales install a heat pump. This has led to asurge in applications.,external However, he also said around a fifth of homes would never be required to switch from a fossil fuel boiler. This makes net zero by 2050 ""considerably harder to achieve"", the CCC warned. The UK has some of theleast energy-efficient homes,externalin Europe. Insulation is one of the most effective ways to reduce emissions from housing, by reducing the energy needed for heating. The government has introduced theGreat British Insulation Scheme,externalto help insulate around 300,000 of the poorest-performing homes. But in September 2023, the government cancelled regulations that would have required landlords to improve the energy efficiency of private rented homes. Transport (not including aviation and shipping)accounted for just under a quarter,externalof UK emissions in 2022, making it the largest emitting sector. The government hasdelayed its banon the sale of new petrol and diesel cars from 2030 to 2035, a move which has divided the car industry. But it has set quotas for the percentage of a manufacturer's sales that have to bezero emission, increasing year-on-year to 80% by 2030. This has been welcomed by the CCC. Electric car sales have been faring relatively well,according to the CCC,external. In 2023,16.5% of new car sales were battery electric vehicles,external- up from less than 2% in 2019. Thegovernment wants 300,000 publicly-accessible charging points,externalfor electric cars by 2030, in addition to those in private homes or workplaces. The number of public charging points had increased tomore than 60,000,externalby the end of April 2024 - up by 45% from the previous year- but these are not evenly distributed across the UK. Nearly half of allnew bus registrations,externalwere zero-emission in 2023. The government has committed further funding forregional electric bus schemes,external, but is yet to confirm when it will end the sale of diesel buses. The government aims to remove all diesel-only trains by 2040, butthe CCC argues,externalit needs a clearer plan to achieve this. Overall,the CCC says,externalthere has been ""little progress"" switching to lower carbon modes of travel, such as public transport. Flyingmakes up,externalabout 7% of overall UK emissions, andshipping about,external3%. The UK hasa strategy,externalfor delivering net zero aviation by 2050. It has been criticised forrelying too muchon technologies such as cleaner fuels and zero emissions aircraft that are unlikely to be widely available anytime soon. As a result,the CCC says,externalthat the government should be looking at how to manage demand rather than allowing it to grow - for example addressing private jet use and providing lower cost rail travel. In April 2024 the government announceda target for 10% of jet fuel to come from ""sustainable sources"",externalby 2030. Progress has also been slow to establish a strategy to decarbonise shipping,the CCC says,external. Agriculture and the way land is usedproduce 11%,externalof the UK's greenhouse gas emissions. The government released its food strategy in June 2022, but theCCC said,externalit failed to deliver action to drive down emissions from agriculture at the required scale or pace. It has also been criticised fornot doing moreto encourage a switch to a more sustainable diet - eating more plant-based food, for example. Meat consumption in the UKhas been fallingthough - down 17% in the decade to 2019. In February 2023, the governmentreleased details,externalof its long-awaited environmental land management schemes for England, replacing the EU common agricultural policy. The schemes mean farmers can apply for public money to support activities that benefit the environment. What's your diet's carbon footprint? Trees and peatlandsplay important roles,externalin removing carbon dioxide (CO2) from the atmosphere. UKforest cover,externalis 13%,among the lowest,externalin Europe. The government has atarget to plant,external30,000 hectares of trees a year by 2025. However, annual UK tree planting hasnot risen above,external15,000 hectares since 2001. TheUK forestry body has warnedthat there is ""zero chance"" of the UK meeting its target. It is estimated thatonly around 20% of UK peatlands are in a near-natural state,external, including only 1.3% in England. These damaged peatlandsare responsible for around 5%of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions, whereas healthy peatlands would take up CO2. The government aims to restore around 29,000 hectares of peatland a year across England, Scotland and Wales by 2025. But current levels areless than half this,external, leaving the target ""significantly off track"", the CCC says. Hydrogen is a low-carbon fuel that could be used for transport, heating, power generation or energy storage. Thegovernment considers,externalhydrogen to be a critical part of future energy security and decarbonisation. Itwants to have,externala 10GW hydrogen production capacity by 2030. The industry is very much in its infancy, andthe government admits,externalit will need ""rapid and significant scale-up"" in the coming years. It has announced aseries of projects and incentives for investment,external. The government has promised a decision on the role of hydrogen in heating in 2026, buthad to cancel a proposed trialbecause the main source of hydrogen supply was not ready. The government sees technologies to capture the CO2 produced by power stations and industrial processes as a key part of its net zero strategy. It aims to capture and storebetween 20 and 30 million tonnes of CO2 a year,externalby 2030. In March 2023, the Chancellor pledged Â£20bn in investment in carbon capture over the next 20 years, andseveral projects have been announced,externalaround the UK. But the technology is still emerging, is expensive, and can only capture a portion of emissions. What is carbon capture and can it fight climate change? Industrial emissionsrepresent about 14%,externalof the UK's total. The government aims to cut emissions from manufacturing by about two thirds by 2035. It hasa scheme to cap the amount of emissions,externalallowed by individual sectors each year, reducing that amount over time. But the scheme risks companies shifting production to other countries.

"UK threatens legal action over French fishing rowThe foreign secretary accuses France of ""unfair behaviour"" as it warns it could block British boats.","This video can not be played Liz Truss: France has made completely unacceptable threats The UK is prepared to take legal action against France over the ongoing row about post-Brexit fishing rights, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has warned. Last month, the UK and Jersey denied permits to dozens of French boats to operate in their waters. In retaliation, France threatened to block British boats from some of its ports and cut electricity to Jersey. Ms Truss told the BBC that France was acting ""unfairly"" in setting a deadline for issuing more fishing permits. France says that, unless this happens by Tuesday, it will prevent British fishing boats from disembarking at its ports, and step up border checks on UK goods. Officials in Paris have also threatened to tighten security checks on British boats, and increase checks on trucks going to and from the UK. Representatives from the European Commission, France, the UK and the Channel Islands are holding talks via video link on Monday afternoon. A commission spokesperson said they hoped the meeting would bring a ""swift solution on the outstanding issues"". Fishing after Brexit: What are the rules? Turbulence has hit relations with France, PM says Who really owns UK fishing rights? France has accused the UK of making a ""political choice"" by rejecting ""more than 40%"" of French boats' applications to fish in UK and Channel Island waters. But the UK's Brexit minister Lord Frost has said the UK had been ""very generous"" in granting 98% of applications from EU vessels. Ms Truss told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that fishing licences had been awarded to French boats ""entirely in accordance"" with the post-Brexit deal between the EU and UK. She warned that unless France withdrew its threats, the UK was prepared to ""use the dispute resolution mechanism in the trade deal we signed with the EU to take action against the French"". ""We're simply not going to roll over in the face of these threats,"" she added. For Labour, shadow business secretary Ed Miliband told Sky News he ""didn't like the way the French had behaved"" and urged both sides to ""lower the temperature"" of the debate. Emmanuel Macron is under massive pressure from the nationalist right in France in the lead-up to next year's presidential election. He has a lot to gain from the metaphorical waving of the French flag, being seen to be standing up to ""perfidious Albion"", as the French have sometimes referred to the Brits (or the English, depending on the exact moment in history) for centuries. Boris Johnson too knows that a row with the French - or with Brussels - plays well with much of his Conservative Party and many of his supporters. A useful diversion, say critics, from domestic problems like soaring gas prices, haulier shortages and studies, like the recent one published by the Office for Budget Responsibility, suggesting that Brexit will cost the UK economy more than Covid-19. Read Katya's blog in full On Sunday, Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron met for 30 minutes during the G20 summit but failed to resolved the problem. The UK government said it was ""up to France"" to draw back from its threats, while Mr Macron insisted the ball was ""in Britain's court"". UK-French tensions were further inflamed on Friday, when a letter emerged from French Prime Minister Jean Castex to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen suggesting the fishing dispute was an opportunity to show that EU countries risked more damage from leaving the bloc than staying in. Mr Johnson said he was ""puzzled to read a letter from the French prime minister explicitly asking for Britain to be punished for leaving the EU"". Although fishing is a small part of both the British and French economies, it has been a highly sensitive political issue throughout Brexit. The latest row began after a British trawler was seized by France and another fined during checks off Le Havre on Thursday.

Today's live coverage has been brought to you by Paul McLaren, George Bowden, Emma Harrison, Doug Faulkner, Gary Kitchener, James Clarke, Joseph Lee, Holly Honderich, George Wright, Robert Greenall and Kevin Ponniah. The BBC Climate Change Debate has ended. MÃºte Bourup Egede, prime minister of Greenland, finished the debate by saying he wanted to ""push all the countries - especially big countries with big economies - to collaborate with all of the countries in the world to invest in green energy"". ""This is for the future."" Reality Check Gina McCarthy, a climate adviser for the White House, said the US was âquadrupling its commitmentsâ on climate aid. In April, President Joe Biden said he would double funding to developing nations to tackle climate change. Then, in September at the UN General Assembly, he said he would âwork with the Congress to double that number againâ â quadrupling former President Obamaâs commitment. These figures are relative to Mr Obamaâs spending, not that of his immediate predecessor, because former President Donald Trump mostly withdrew from the USâs international commitments. But Mr Biden hasnât yet managed to pass his budget in Congress, which has the power to make laws. So that commitment is not set in stone yet. Read more about what the biggest polluters are doing to tackle climate change. Reality Check âOne of the things that government is trying to do is to incentivise through grants, the acquisition of these [electric] cars,â said Kwasi Kwarteng, UK Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. The UK government offers a grant of Â£2,500 to those looking to buy an electric car. However, the government has reduced the grant size over the past few years. The maximum grant started off at Â£5,000 in 2011, dropped to Â£4,500 in 2016, then Â£3,500 in 2018 and Â£3,000 in 2020 before being reduced to its current level. As well as the new reduced amount, the Department for Transport has also narrowed the eligibility criteria - restricting the grant for cars costing below Â£35,000. The move was heavily criticised by industry groups and car manufacturers who called it ""disappointing"". Read more about the move to electric cars. Colombia's Minister for Mining & Energy, Diego Mesa, says that there are still about 500,000 families in Colombia without access to electricity. ""We have one billion people around the world with no access to electricity who need to use wood to cook which impacts on deforestation â we have to fix that as well."" Reality Check Colombiaâs Minister of Energy and Mining, Diego Mesa, said carbon capture could help on the path to net zero. âThe problem is not the source of energy, the problem is emissions,"" he said. This is the idea that instead of drastically reducing the amount of carbon dioxide we emit, we could at least partially rely on technology to remove carbon dioxide thatâs already been emitted and store it or use it for energy. Some of these technologies do already exist but they would have to be scaled up enormously to make a dent â at great expense. Some of these processes themselves use a lot of energy to separate the carbon dioxide. And there are scientists who fear the promise of carbon capture technology might act as a âblank chequeâ for people to keep polluting at the same rate, in the so-far untested belief the damage can be reversed at some point in the future. Asked about the new Cambo oilfield to the west of the Shetland Islands, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng is booed as he says that the UK government will not rule out granting a licence for operations. He says he wonât shut the door on a quarter of a million jobs and that the climate change debate is about transition. ""It's a licence that was granted 20 years ago and it's a planning decision that we're going to examine. That's all I'm going to say about that,"" Kwarteng says, to loud boos. ""I can't simply say to the quarter of a million people who work in the sector in the UK that we're going to just close the door on the sector,"" he adds.  White House National Climate Advisor, Gina McCarthy, says that weâre being asked by young people to stop destroying the planet. President Biden is investing $550bn to grow the economy ""not to sacrifice it,"" she says. ""These are investments not penalties, and as soon as China and Brazil figure out that they are on the losing end of the proposition â theyâll be running to catch up."" Gina McCarthy is asked about criticism of President Joe Biden's huge motorcade at COP26. Kirsty Wark points out that the US motorcade was more than 80 vehicles long during a recent Biden visit to the Vatican. âWe have to make change but itâs going to take more than looking at whether or not its a big motorcade,"" McCarthy responds. More now from the BBC's Big Global Climate Debate, under way on BBC One. White House National Climate Advisor, Gina McCarthy, says that Russia and China should be at COP26. But she says that doesn't mean we should allow them to ""decide the fate of the world"". ""We should show them they are missing out if they do not join us and take action"" McCarthy says. ""I'm disappointed they are not here but they should not be allowed to dictate the lack of action. They canât dictate the lack of action. Science is telling us what to do and weâre here to get it done."" In the past half hour it's been confirmed that leaders from more than 100 countrieswill sign an agreement to end deforestation by 2030- providing funds to support and
restore forests. But what do experts think of the first major deal from COP26? Prof Simon Lewis at University College London, an expert in
climate and forests, says: âIt is good news
to have a political commitment to end deforestation from so many countries, and
significant funding to move forward on that journey."" ""That indigenous peoples are finally being acknowledged as key protectors of forests is particularly welcome, alongside additional funding for rainforest nations and obligations on consumer countries and companies to clean up their supply chains. Prof Simon Lewis, University College London He adds: âThe real weakness is a failure to tackle growing demand for products grown on rainforest land. But that would mean tackling high levels of meat consumption in places like the UK and US, and Boris Johnson has no appetite for that, so canât convene world leaders around that critical aspect of stopping deforestation.â And Chatham House Executive Director Sustainability and author of Rethinking the Amazonian Jungle, Ana Jung, called the announcement an important building block for COP26 success but says details will be key. The BBC's Big Global Climate Debate is now under way for viewers in the UK on BBC One, the iPlayer and by clicking the play button at the top of this page. We will be bringing you the biggest updates from the debate live here. Sitting on the panel are: A group of leaders at COP26 will sign the climate change conference's first major deal on Tuesday when they promise to stop deforestation by 2030. Signatories will include Brazil, where large parts of the Amazon rainforest have been cut down, and Indonesia, the world's largest exporter of palm oil. Felling trees contributes to climate change because it depletes forests that absorb vast amounts of the warming gas CO2. More money is also being promised to protect and restore forests.
More than 100 countries say they will sign the deal, covering about 85% of the world's forests. And governments of 28 countries will commit to remove deforestation from the global trade of food and other agricultural products such as palm oil, soya and cocoa. To stop deforestation and break the link between tree loss and agriculture, almost Â£14 billion ($19.2 billion) of public and private funding is being pledged. Some of this will go to developing countries to restore damaged land, tackle wildfire and support indigenous communities. Read morehere. We'll be bringing you coverage of the BBC Global Climate Debate - which begins at 22:35 GMT. Viewers in the UK can watch the programme on BBC One, the BBC iPlayer and by clicking the play button at the top of this page. A panel of leading international political figures has come together to take questions from young people in the studio in Glasgow - and around
the world - on the challenges presented by climate change. Presented by Kirsty Wark, the debate gives young people across the world the chance to hold their leaders to account
on action for climate change. Hilda Flavia Nakabuye, 24, is a climate change activist from Kampala, the Ugandan capital. Her activism was prompted by the impact of climate change on her family's lives, as she explains here: ""When I was still young I had a plantation with my family, but we lost it due to the effects of climate change. Heavy rains, floods, strong winds, unpredictable seasons, dry streams, all these things. ""In 2017 I joined a discussion at my school that was about climate change. I then understood that the effects my family were feeling was because of climate change. ""I started to speak up as a climate activist and as a campaigner. We travelled to schools and communities and in 2019 I started the Fridays For Future movement in Uganda. Now we have a network of 53,000. ""We were arrested a few times by the police because of the climate strikes - they alleged we might be a political party. ""I have very little hope in COP26 because I haven't seen any concrete actions being taken in the last 25 COPs. Many people are being under-represented, especially from the most affected countries, mostly from the global south. ""We are quickly losing our hope in the leaders because of their inaction. Our survival and the survival of the future generations depend on our actions today. ""Itâs either we come up with concrete actions or we fail all generations to come."" Reality Check Indiaâs Prime Minister Narendra Modi has long resisted setting a
date for his country to achieve net zero -  balancing out greenhouse gas emissions with measures to remove them from the
atmosphere. On Monday, he said India would now achieve this by 2070. This is a significantly longer timescale than the UK, EU and the US which have set targets of 2050 to reach this goal. It is also a decade later than Chinaâs 2060 target. Modi also said India would aim to supply 50% of all its
energy requirements from renewable sources by 2030 with a non-fossil fuel
generating capacity of 500 gigawatts (GW). India currently generates a
little over 100GW from non-fossil sources and is unlikely to hit an earlier target
of 175 gigawatts by 2022. Although India has expanded its
capacity to generate power from sources such as wind and solar, it still relies
heavily on coal. It currently powers about 70% of the countryâs electricity
grid. You can read morehereabout India's climate challenge. Prince Charles has been having a busy day at the COP26 summit and appeared to be in good spirits this evening as Boris Johnson praised his environmental efforts over the years. The Prince of Wales spoke to the assembled world leaders this afternoon before a visit to a distillery run by a former drug addict who had been helped by the Prince's Trust charity. Ryan Longmuir, who started Regis Banqueting 18 years ago after receiving a Â£5,000 loan from the charity, handed the prince a glass of whisky and said ""it's great meeting him"". Charles then joined other royals and some of the political leaders ata dinner reception at Glasgow's Kelvingrove Museum. The prince was again seen being handed a drink and this time, Reuters reports, he joked: ""I think I need it after today."" He may have been referring to a moment when he briefly lost his footing as he made his way to the stage to deliver this speech earlier in the day. But one man who apparently didn't think the prince had had a bad day was the UK prime minister. Our political editorLaura Kuenssberg has tweeted,externalthat Boris Johnson complimented the Prince of Wales at the reception, saying: âYou heard me earlier on say this was a job for James Bond. Well we have somebody who drives an electric Aston Martin who has a plan to defuse the ticking time bomb. ""l just want to say you're a prophet without honour and you've been right for a very long time."" Outgoing German Chancellor Angela Merkel said earlier that a comprehensive transformation in ways of working is needed to cut CO2 emissions - and not just action from governments. ""That's why I want to make a clear plea here for carbon pricing. This already exists within the EU and also in China, for example,"" she says. Carbon pricing - effectively a tax on CO2 emissions - has been called for in some industries,such as shipping, as a means of forcing polluting businesses to clean up their trade. Merkel said it would be a way to ensure industries and businesses had an incentive to develop technology that would be better for the global climate. That's a very clear expression of what we need to do in a decisive decade, she said. ""Then we will know how to best arrange CO2-free mobility, CO2-free industry and CO2-free processes of our life."" One of the ways we can reduce our carbon footprint is through what we eat. Switching to a plant-based diet can help fight climate change, according to a major report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),which says the West's high consumption of meat and dairy is fuelling global warming. If youâre eating beef three to five times a week, over an entire year your consumption is contributing 1,611kg to your annual greenhouse gas emissions. That's the equivalent of driving a regular petrol car 4,112 miles (6,618km), or taking five return flights from London to Malaga. Many are already taking note of this. Daily meat consumption in the UK has fallen by 17% in the past decade,a study has shown. To find out theclimate impact of what you eat and drink, choose from one of the 34 items in our calculatorand pick how often you have it. As the day draws to a close in Glasgow, US President Joe Biden says on Twitter that he hopes those present at the summit ""meet the moment on climate, and kick off a decade of ambition, action, and innovation to preserve our shared future"". ""There's no substitute for face-to-face diplomacy,"" he writes. Biden is among 25,000 delegates from about 200 countries - and from every region in the world - in Glasgow this week, gathered to share plans for how they will cut emissions by 2030. The much-anticipated United Nations gathering is one of the biggest summits the UK has ever hosted. Over two weeks, we can expect a flurry of announcements from countries promising to curb emissions, like switches to electric cars or an expedited phase-out of coal. By the end of the conference, some form of declaration is expected, with every country required to sign on. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Bin strikes begin as world leaders arrive for COP26Glasgow City Council says the week-long walk out by the GMB Scotland union was ""very disappointing"".Glasgow & West ScotlandComments","Refuse workers and street cleaners are striking for one week A strike by refuse staff and street cleaners in Glasgow has started, as world leaders arrive for the COP26 climate summit. GMB Scotland said members in the city council's cleansing department would be striking for the next week. The union accused the council of failing to give members ""proper time and space"" to consider an offer from local authority body Cosla. Glasgow City Council said the union's decision was ""very disappointing"". They said they would meet with GMB ""at any time"" to resolve the dispute. Bin strikes during COP26 suspended after pay offer Glaswegians greet COP26 with pessimism and hope Rail strike action during COP26 called off Cosla proposed a pay rise of 5.8% for the lowest paid staff as part of a Â£1,062 increase for staff earning below Â£25,000. The deal involved Â£30m from the Scottish government and Â£18.5m from local government. GMB Scotland, Unison and Unite all suspended industrial action on Friday, after the offer was tabled, saying they would consult members. However, on Sunday GMB Scotland confirmed the strike in Glasgow was back on. The union's Drew Duffy told BBC Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that the council was ""constantly goading our members"" and they had decided ""enough was enough and the strike continues"". He explained: ""The workforce are the lowest paid workers in Scotland. There are deep rooted problems within Glasgow City Council. We have been trying to meet with the council. ""It is a constant breakdown of industrial relations, there have been longstanding problems with low pay and discriminatory pay and our members have just had enough. The conditions they work in, the pay they receive is not good enough."" Refuse staff and street cleaners on a picket line outside the Dawsholm Recycling Centre in Glasgow on Monday morning The move by the union came as Glasgow geared up to welcome about 120 world leaders to the city for crucial climate talks at COP26. In a statement released on Monday, a Glasgow City Council spokeswoman said: ""The agreement struck at national level gave two weeks to consider the pay offer and so there is no reason for this strike to go ahead at this time. It is very disappointing the GMB has opted for this course of action. ""We have already agreed their request for time to meet with their members. And, while we remain available to meet with them at any time, we are unable to deliver their request for a pay increase. ""That is part of a national negotiation and a new deal was tabled by Cosla last week. ""It appeared that GMB, along with the other unions, had agreed to suspend the strike until national consultation was complete and it is very disappointing they have reneged on that agreement and have not given us the required 14 days' notice after they publicly announced the suspension on Friday."" The GMB, Unison and Unite had initially called for a Â£2,000 pay rise and previously rejected an Â£850-a-year increase for staff earning up to Â£25,000 from Cosla. Gail Macgregor, Cosla's resources spokeswoman, said they put their ""new and improved"" offer to trade unions last week. ""We were pleased to note that that it was accepted with the expectation that strike action be suspended whilst they presented the new offer to their membership for consideration,"" she added. ""GMB in particular made a public statement that they were suspending strike action for a period of two weeks as of Friday whilst the ballot of their members was conducted nationally across all 32 councils that this affects. ""We very much hope that this remains the case and that all members are given the opportunity to participate whilst essential services are maintained."" The GMB previously denied workers were using the global climate conference as a bargaining chip but said staff had been ""put in a corner"" by Cosla despite their efforts during the pandemic and were ""fed up of being disrespected and undervalued by the government"". The Scottish government said it was not party to the pay negotiations, but said it had made a one-off offer of Â£30m in additional funding to help find a solution. Scottish minister Michael Matheson, speaking to BBC Radio Scotland on Monday, said: ""The GMB locally have entered into a dispute now with GCC which I understand is not to do with the actual package itself but it's the process around being able to engage with their members and discuss that with them. ""I understand that discussions were taking place last night and the Scottish government would want to continue to encourage Cosla, GCC and the GMB to continue to discuss this issue and to try and find a quick resolution to what I believe is a process issue rather than an issue around the deal that was proposed.""

We travelled to schools and communities and in 2019 I started the Fridays For Future movement in Uganda. Now we have a network of 53,000. ""We were arrested a few times by the police because of the climate strikes - they alleged we might be a political party. ""I have very little hope in COP26 because I haven't seen any concrete actions being taken in the last 25 COPs. Many people are being under-represented, especially from the most affected countries, mostly from the global south. ""We are quickly losing our hope in the leaders because of their inaction. Our survival and the survival of the future generations depend on our actions today. ""Itâs either we come up with concrete actions or we fail all generations to come."" Reality Check Indiaâs Prime Minister Narendra Modi has long resisted setting a
date for his country to achieve net zero -  balancing out greenhouse gas emissions with measures to remove them from the
atmosphere. On Monday, he said India would now achieve this by 2070. This is a significantly longer timescale than the UK, EU and the US which have set targets of 2050 to reach this goal. It is also a decade later than Chinaâs 2060 target. Modi also said India would aim to supply 50% of all its
energy requirements from renewable sources by 2030 with a non-fossil fuel
generating capacity of 500 gigawatts (GW). India currently generates a
little over 100GW from non-fossil sources and is unlikely to hit an earlier target
of 175 gigawatts by 2022. Although India has expanded its
capacity to generate power from sources such as wind and solar, it still relies
heavily on coal. It currently powers about 70% of the countryâs electricity
grid. You can read morehereabout India's climate challenge. Prince Charles has been having a busy day at the COP26 summit and appeared to be in good spirits this evening as Boris Johnson praised his environmental efforts over the years. The Prince of Wales spoke to the assembled world leaders this afternoon before a visit to a distillery run by a former drug addict who had been helped by the Prince's Trust charity. Ryan Longmuir, who started Regis Banqueting 18 years ago after receiving a Â£5,000 loan from the charity, handed the prince a glass of whisky and said ""it's great meeting him"". Charles then joined other royals and some of the political leaders ata dinner reception at Glasgow's Kelvingrove Museum. The prince was again seen being handed a drink and this time, Reuters reports, he joked: ""I think I need it after today."" He may have been referring to a moment when he briefly lost his footing as he made his way to the stage to deliver this speech earlier in the day. But one man who apparently didn't think the prince had had a bad day was the UK prime minister. Our political editorLaura Kuenssberg has tweeted,externalthat Boris Johnson complimented the Prince of Wales at the reception, saying: âYou heard me earlier on say this was a job for James Bond. Well we have somebody who drives an electric Aston Martin who has a plan to defuse the ticking time bomb. ""l just want to say you're a prophet without honour and you've been right for a very long time."" Outgoing German Chancellor Angela Merkel said earlier that a comprehensive transformation in ways of working is needed to cut CO2 emissions - and not just action from governments. ""That's why I want to make a clear plea here for carbon pricing. This already exists within the EU and also in China, for example,"" she says. Carbon pricing - effectively a tax on CO2 emissions - has been called for in some industries,such as shipping, as a means of forcing polluting businesses to clean up their trade. Merkel said it would be a way to ensure industries and businesses had an incentive to develop technology that would be better for the global climate. That's a very clear expression of what we need to do in a decisive decade, she said. ""Then we will know how to best arrange CO2-free mobility, CO2-free industry and CO2-free processes of our life."" One of the ways we can reduce our carbon footprint is through what we eat. Switching to a plant-based diet can help fight climate change, according to a major report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),which says the West's high consumption of meat and dairy is fuelling global warming. If youâre eating beef three to five times a week, over an entire year your consumption is contributing 1,611kg to your annual greenhouse gas emissions. That's the equivalent of driving a regular petrol car 4,112 miles (6,618km), or taking five return flights from London to Malaga. Many are already taking note of this. Daily meat consumption in the UK has fallen by 17% in the past decade,a study has shown.

As the day draws to a close in Glasgow, US President Joe Biden says on Twitter that he hopes those present at the summit ""meet the moment on climate, and kick off a decade of ambition, action, and innovation to preserve our shared future"". ""There's no substitute for face-to-face diplomacy,"" he writes. Biden is among 25,000 delegates from about 200 countries - and from every region in the world - in Glasgow this week, gathered to share plans for how they will cut emissions by 2030. The much-anticipated United Nations gathering is one of the biggest summits the UK has ever hosted. Over two weeks, we can expect a flurry of announcements from countries promising to curb emissions, like switches to electric cars or an expedited phase-out of coal. By the end of the conference, some form of declaration is expected, with every country required to sign on. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Climate at one minute to midnight, says JohnsonAs world leaders gather for COP26 in Glasgow, Prime Minister Boris Johnson says action is needed.","This video can not be played PM confirms he is not in favour of new UK coal mine The world is at ""one minute to midnight"", having run down the clock on waiting to combat climate change, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. He was speaking as world leaders arrived for the landmark COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Johnson said leaders needed to move from ""aspiration to action"" to slow global warming. He added the summit was a ""critical"" moment for him, and said an ambitious outcome was still ""in the balance"". For the first time, Mr Johnson also confirmed he did not want to see acontroversial proposed coal mine in Cumbriago ahead. ""I'm not in favour of more coal,"" said the prime minister. ""But it is not a decision for me, it is a decision for the planning authorities."" The government has been criticised for not stopping the mine project going ahead. This is the strongest statement the prime minister has yet made on the subject - and could help negotiations, because persuading nations to phase out coal is one of the central goals the UK government has set for the crucial UN conference. LIVE: Latest updates from COP26 Why the battle for British coal matters to the world The UK is hosting the summit amid mounting concern among scientists that countries are not doing enough to limit the emissions of greenhouse gases, which have caused average global temperatures to rise. The 2015 Paris climate conference called for average temperatures to rise by well below 2C, and preferably only 1.5C, when compared to pre-industrial averages. World leadersarrived at the venuein Glasgow -which has officially become United Nations territory- for the official opening on Monday. Later, they will make statements setting out what their countries are doing on climate change. As UN territory, the venue is being patrolled by armed UN officers and Police Scotland is only allowed to enter if they are invited by the UN secretary general - or if they believe there is a threat to life. Tap or click to go through the gallery  On BBC Breakfast on Monday, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss was asked whether it was necessary for world leaders to fly to the conference - as estimates suggested 400 private planeshad flown into Glasgow. She replied that it was ""fantastic"" that world leaders were there in person. ""When you really get into crunch negotiations, when you want to look somebody in the eye and talk to them face to face, you do need to meet in person,"" she said. ""World leaders are going to have to make some tough decisionsâ¦ they're going to have to commit to things they didn't necessarily want to when they arrived at the conference. That's why it's really important we do have people face to face."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she understood that the air travel involved may send a ""mixed message"" - but agreed that more progress is made when leaders meet in person. ""Given all of the travel required to get here, it even further increases the pressure on the shoulders of world leaders to make sure it's worth it,"" she said. Ms Sturgeon added that the goal of the conference was to increase countries' ambitions to reduce emissions. ""Right now, the commitments countries have made wouldn't even limit [global warming] to 2C, let alone 1.5."" Planespotters said COP26 was a ""once-in-a-lifetime"" opportunity to spot aircraft not normally seen in Scotland The COP26 summit immediately followed a G20 meeting in Rome - made up of leaders of 20 of the world's biggest economies - whichended on a downbeat note from Mr Johnson,after only 12 of the 20 committed to be carbon neutral by 2050. Speaking to the BBC separately, Mr Johnson promised to add Â£1bn to the money the government has earmarked over the next four years to help developing countries. The government has already conceded that the developed world would not deliver in full on a promise made in 2009 to pay poorer countries $100bn a year to help tackle climate change - roughly equivalent to Â£73bn based on current exchange rates. The government has also been criticised for cutting foreign aid this year. Mr Johnson urged other developed nations to commit more cash. He said the other two central goals of the conference would be persuading world leaders to commit to accelerating the transition away from petrol and diesel cars and to stop deforestation. Climate change is one of the world's most pressing problems.Governments must promise more ambitious cuts in warming gases if we are to prevent greater global temperature rises. The summit in Glasgow is where change could happen.You need to watch for the promises made by the world's biggest polluters, like the US and China, and whether poorer countries are getting the support they need. All our lives will change.Decisions made here could impact our jobs, how we heat our homes, what we eat and how we travel. Read more about the COP26 summit here. Mr Johnson also defended the decision inlast week's Budgetto cut the duty on short-haul internal flights by 50%. He described it as a difficult decision, adding: ""Even the distinguished Scottish politicians who are beating me up about this don't actually themselves come to London by any other means."" The comment appears to be a criticism of the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford. Mr Blackford branded the cut in passenger duty a ""disgrace"" and claimed it was evidence the government did ""not understand the climate challenge"". Mr Johnson told the BBC that drawing more private finance into low carbon investments would be crucial to ensuring a rapid reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Governments can bring billions to the table, he said, but the market has ""hundreds of trillions"". When asked what the Johnson household was doing to cut its carbon footprint, the prime minister joked that he had ""totally abolished commuting"" when he moved into No 10 and started living above his place of work. He declined to say whether he had cut beef out of his diet, adding he had ""got to start eating a lot less of all kinds of things"". Mr Johnson would not confirm whether he now regarded himself as an environmentalist, but insisted he was ""not the black sheep of my family"" on green issues. Boris Johnson's wife Carrie, his father Stanley and his brother Leo are all very keen environmentalists. The Archbishop of Canterbury said climate change was ""absolutely a moral issue"". ""This is our neighbours all around the world, those who are already suffering catastrophic impacts,"" Justin Welby told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""This is life or death."" Mr Welby - who used to work in an oil executive - said he did not regret working in the industry as he ""learnt a huge amount from it"", and added the vast majority of people in the industry are ""pretty passionate about changing"". Additional reporting by Francesca Gillett The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

UK and EU's row over Northern Ireland escalates,"Brexit Minister Lord Frost and European Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic held talks last week The UK and EU's disagreement over how to handle post-Brexit trade involving Northern Ireland has escalated. European Commission Vice-President Maros Sefcovic said he was ""increasingly concerned"" the UK was embarking on ""a path of confrontation"". His British negotiating counterpart, Lord Frost, has accused Brussels of behaving ""without regard"" to the huge sensitivities in Northern Ireland. The plan in place aims to ensure an open border on the island of Ireland. The UK wants key changes to the plan, known officially as the Northern Ireland Protocol, while the EU has suggested a more modest package of measures that would reduce its practical impact. ""Peace is too precious in Northern Ireland to be put at risk,"" Mr Sefcovichas written in an editorial published in the Daily Telegraph.,external No breakthrough after latest NI Protocol talks Why Brexit still has a Northern Ireland problem Mr Sefcovic writes that Brussels has come up ""with a robust package of solutions which has the potential to fix"" challenges in implementing the protocol. ""This was done in good faith and now I am working round the clock to reach an agreement with the UK Government to provide stability, certainty and predictability that Northern Ireland deserves,"" he writes. ""I am increasingly concerned that the UK Government will refuse to engage with this and embark on a path of confrontation."" Separately, former Brexit chief negotiator Lord Frost accused the EU of an ""overly strict"" enforcement of the protocol. The cabinet office minister said the EU was behaving ""without regard to the huge political, economic and identity sensitivities"" in Northern Ireland. Lord Frost made the comments in the foreword to a new paper for the Policy Exchange think tank, which details how negotiations in the Brexit process have been hampered by decisions made in 2017. He suggests that a 2017 EU-UK joint report, which set the terms for the Brexit process, was a result of the UK failing to make ""the necessary mental shift from being a member of the EU to negotiating exit from the EU"". Lord Frost said: ""We must return to the protocol and deliver a more robust, and more balanced, outcome than we could in 2019."" The latest disagreement over the protocol comes following growing tensions sparked by another post-Brexit issue:Anglo-French fishing rights.

UK threatens legal action over French fish row,"This video can not be played Liz Truss: France has made completely unacceptable threats The UK is prepared to take legal action against France over the ongoing row about post-Brexit fishing rights, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss has warned. Last month, the UK and Jersey denied permits to dozens of French boats to operate in their waters. In retaliation, France threatened to block British boats from some of its ports and cut electricity to Jersey. Ms Truss told the BBC that France was acting ""unfairly"" in setting a deadline for issuing more fishing permits. France says that, unless this happens by Tuesday, it will prevent British fishing boats from disembarking at its ports, and step up border checks on UK goods. Officials in Paris have also threatened to tighten security checks on British boats, and increase checks on trucks going to and from the UK. Representatives from the European Commission, France, the UK and the Channel Islands are holding talks via video link on Monday afternoon. A commission spokesperson said they hoped the meeting would bring a ""swift solution on the outstanding issues"". Fishing after Brexit: What are the rules? Turbulence has hit relations with France, PM says Who really owns UK fishing rights? France has accused the UK of making a ""political choice"" by rejecting ""more than 40%"" of French boats' applications to fish in UK and Channel Island waters. But the UK's Brexit minister Lord Frost has said the UK had been ""very generous"" in granting 98% of applications from EU vessels. Ms Truss told BBC Radio 4's Today programme that fishing licences had been awarded to French boats ""entirely in accordance"" with the post-Brexit deal between the EU and UK. She warned that unless France withdrew its threats, the UK was prepared to ""use the dispute resolution mechanism in the trade deal we signed with the EU to take action against the French"". ""We're simply not going to roll over in the face of these threats,"" she added. For Labour, shadow business secretary Ed Miliband told Sky News he ""didn't like the way the French had behaved"" and urged both sides to ""lower the temperature"" of the debate. Emmanuel Macron is under massive pressure from the nationalist right in France in the lead-up to next year's presidential election. He has a lot to gain from the metaphorical waving of the French flag, being seen to be standing up to ""perfidious Albion"", as the French have sometimes referred to the Brits (or the English, depending on the exact moment in history) for centuries. Boris Johnson too knows that a row with the French - or with Brussels - plays well with much of his Conservative Party and many of his supporters. A useful diversion, say critics, from domestic problems like soaring gas prices, haulier shortages and studies, like the recent one published by the Office for Budget Responsibility, suggesting that Brexit will cost the UK economy more than Covid-19. Read Katya's blog in full On Sunday, Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron met for 30 minutes during the G20 summit but failed to resolved the problem. The UK government said it was ""up to France"" to draw back from its threats, while Mr Macron insisted the ball was ""in Britain's court"". UK-French tensions were further inflamed on Friday, when a letter emerged from French Prime Minister Jean Castex to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen suggesting the fishing dispute was an opportunity to show that EU countries risked more damage from leaving the bloc than staying in. Mr Johnson said he was ""puzzled to read a letter from the French prime minister explicitly asking for Britain to be punished for leaving the EU"". Although fishing is a small part of both the British and French economies, it has been a highly sensitive political issue throughout Brexit. The latest row began after a British trawler was seized by France and another fined during checks off Le Havre on Thursday.

""We're simply not going to roll over in the face of these threats,"" she added. For Labour, shadow business secretary Ed Miliband told Sky News he ""didn't like the way the French had behaved"" and urged both sides to ""lower the temperature"" of the debate. Emmanuel Macron is under massive pressure from the nationalist right in France in the lead-up to next year's presidential election. He has a lot to gain from the metaphorical waving of the French flag, being seen to be standing up to ""perfidious Albion"", as the French have sometimes referred to the Brits (or the English, depending on the exact moment in history) for centuries. Boris Johnson too knows that a row with the French - or with Brussels - plays well with much of his Conservative Party and many of his supporters. A useful diversion, say critics, from domestic problems like soaring gas prices, haulier shortages and studies, like the recent one published by the Office for Budget Responsibility, suggesting that Brexit will cost the UK economy more than Covid-19. Read Katya's blog in full On Sunday, Boris Johnson and French President Emmanuel Macron met for 30 minutes during the G20 summit but failed to resolved the problem. The UK government said it was ""up to France"" to draw back from its threats, while Mr Macron insisted the ball was ""in Britain's court"". UK-French tensions were further inflamed on Friday, when a letter emerged from French Prime Minister Jean Castex to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen suggesting the fishing dispute was an opportunity to show that EU countries risked more damage from leaving the bloc than staying in. Mr Johnson said he was ""puzzled to read a letter from the French prime minister explicitly asking for Britain to be punished for leaving the EU"". Although fishing is a small part of both the British and French economies, it has been a highly sensitive political issue throughout Brexit. The latest row began after a British trawler was seized by France and another fined during checks off Le Havre on Thursday.

Ryanair recovery continues despite more losses,"Boss Michael O'Leary says the post-pandemic recovery offers good growth opportunities Ryanair says it is expecting to cut fares this winter to help boost passenger demand. While the airline has seen business picking up recently, it warned it was still recovering from the Covid-related collapse in air travel. Ryanairreported a narrowing of half-year losses, but warned its annual deficit could hit â¬200m (Â£170m). Boss Michael O'Leary told the BBC the industry was seeing a ""very strong recovery"" across Europe. However, he said heavy price discounting would be needed to fill aircraft this winter. Keeping prices low and passenger numbers high would ""set us up strongly for a very strong recovery"", he said. Mr O'Leary added that the number of empty seats per plane would shrink from around 20% to under 10% by next summer. The airline expects to return to profitability in the year ending March 2023. ""We're seeing very strong recovery in short-haul travel across Europe and it is being led by Ryanair,"" he told the BBC's Today programme. He said there had been a ""dramatic"" recovery in passenger numbers, from eight million in the three months to June to 31 million in the following three months. On the Beach accuses Ryanair of market abuse Refund probe into Ryanair and BA dropped The recent school holidays had seen Ryanair ""full to the gills as people got a last bit of sun"", Mr O'Leary said. But that did not mean the hit to the industry from the coronavirus pandemic was over, he added. The carrier reported an after-tax loss of â¬48m for the six months to September, which compared with a loss after tax of â¬411m a year earlier. Ryanair carried 39.1 million passengers in the six months to the end of September, 54% fewer than in the same period of 2019. The airline is expecting to make of loss of between â¬100m-200m for the full year, but Mr O'Leary said the guidance could not be more specific because there was still ""little visibility"" on ticket prices and recovery. But he said the post-pandemic recovery offered the best growth opportunities of his three-decade career. In September, Ryanair lifted its passenger growth target. The airline now expects to fly 225 million passengers a year by 2026, up from 200 million previously forecast. The airline reiterated it expects to return to pre-Covid profitability in the year ending March 2023.

Before we go, here's a quick look back at the highlights:  We'll be back tomorrow at 08:00GMT for Day 3. There will be more speeches from world leaders as well as a special focus on deforestation. We'll be looking out for an announcement of a new deal on forests - crucial to keeping global heating to 1.5C. Today's live coverage has been brought to you by Paul McLaren, George Bowden, Emma Harrison, Doug Faulkner, Gary Kitchener, James Clarke, Joseph Lee, Holly Honderich, George Wright, Robert Greenall and Kevin Ponniah. The BBC Climate Change Debate has ended. MÃºte Bourup Egede, prime minister of Greenland, finished the debate by saying he wanted to ""push all the countries - especially big countries with big economies - to collaborate with all of the countries in the world to invest in green energy"". ""This is for the future."" Reality Check Gina McCarthy, a climate adviser for the White House, said the US was âquadrupling its commitmentsâ on climate aid. In April, President Joe Biden said he would double funding to developing nations to tackle climate change. Then, in September at the UN General Assembly, he said he would âwork with the Congress to double that number againâ â quadrupling former President Obamaâs commitment. These figures are relative to Mr Obamaâs spending, not that of his immediate predecessor, because former President Donald Trump mostly withdrew from the USâs international commitments. But Mr Biden hasnât yet managed to pass his budget in Congress, which has the power to make laws. So that commitment is not set in stone yet. Read more about what the biggest polluters are doing to tackle climate change. Reality Check âOne of the things that government is trying to do is to incentivise through grants, the acquisition of these [electric] cars,â said Kwasi Kwarteng, UK Secretary of State for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy. The UK government offers a grant of Â£2,500 to those looking to buy an electric car. However, the government has reduced the grant size over the past few years. The maximum grant started off at Â£5,000 in 2011, dropped to Â£4,500 in 2016, then Â£3,500 in 2018 and Â£3,000 in 2020 before being reduced to its current level. As well as the new reduced amount, the Department for Transport has also narrowed the eligibility criteria - restricting the grant for cars costing below Â£35,000. The move was heavily criticised by industry groups and car manufacturers who called it ""disappointing"". Read more about the move to electric cars. Colombia's Minister for Mining & Energy, Diego Mesa, says that there are still about 500,000 families in Colombia without access to electricity. ""We have one billion people around the world with no access to electricity who need to use wood to cook which impacts on deforestation â we have to fix that as well."" Reality Check Colombiaâs Minister of Energy and Mining, Diego Mesa, said carbon capture could help on the path to net zero. âThe problem is not the source of energy, the problem is emissions,"" he said. This is the idea that instead of drastically reducing the amount of carbon dioxide we emit, we could at least partially rely on technology to remove carbon dioxide thatâs already been emitted and store it or use it for energy. Some of these technologies do already exist but they would have to be scaled up enormously to make a dent â at great expense. Some of these processes themselves use a lot of energy to separate the carbon dioxide. And there are scientists who fear the promise of carbon capture technology might act as a âblank chequeâ for people to keep polluting at the same rate, in the so-far untested belief the damage can be reversed at some point in the future. Asked about the new Cambo oilfield to the west of the Shetland Islands, Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng is booed as he says that the UK government will not rule out granting a licence for operations. He says he wonât shut the door on a quarter of a million jobs and that the climate change debate is about transition. ""It's a licence that was granted 20 years ago and it's a planning decision that we're going to examine. That's all I'm going to say about that,"" Kwarteng says, to loud boos. ""I can't simply say to the quarter of a million people who work in the sector in the UK that we're going to just close the door on the sector,"" he adds.  White House National Climate Advisor, Gina McCarthy, says that weâre being asked by young people to stop destroying the planet. President Biden is investing $550bn to grow the economy ""not to sacrifice it,"" she says. ""These are investments not penalties, and as soon as China and Brazil figure out that they are on the losing end of the proposition â theyâll be running to catch up."" Gina McCarthy is asked about criticism of President Joe Biden's huge motorcade at COP26. Kirsty Wark points out that the US motorcade was more than 80 vehicles long during a recent Biden visit to the Vatican. âWe have to make change but itâs going to take more than looking at whether or not its a big motorcade,"" McCarthy responds. More now from the BBC's Big Global Climate Debate, under way on BBC One. White House National Climate Advisor, Gina McCarthy, says that Russia and China should be at COP26. But she says that doesn't mean we should allow them to ""decide the fate of the world"". ""We should show them they are missing out if they do not join us and take action"" McCarthy says. ""I'm disappointed they are not here but they should not be allowed to dictate the lack of action. They canât dictate the lack of action. Science is telling us what to do and weâre here to get it done."" In the past half hour it's been confirmed that leaders from more than 100 countrieswill sign an agreement to end deforestation by 2030- providing funds to support and
restore forests. But what do experts think of the first major deal from COP26? Prof Simon Lewis at University College London, an expert in
climate and forests, says: âIt is good news
to have a political commitment to end deforestation from so many countries, and
significant funding to move forward on that journey."" ""That indigenous peoples are finally being acknowledged as key protectors of forests is particularly welcome, alongside additional funding for rainforest nations and obligations on consumer countries and companies to clean up their supply chains. Prof Simon Lewis, University College London He adds: âThe real weakness is a failure to tackle growing demand for products grown on rainforest land. But that would mean tackling high levels of meat consumption in places like the UK and US, and Boris Johnson has no appetite for that, so canât convene world leaders around that critical aspect of stopping deforestation.â And Chatham House Executive Director Sustainability and author of Rethinking the Amazonian Jungle, Ana Jung, called the announcement an important building block for COP26 success but says details will be key. The BBC's Big Global Climate Debate is now under way for viewers in the UK on BBC One, the iPlayer and by clicking the play button at the top of this page. We will be bringing you the biggest updates from the debate live here. Sitting on the panel are: A group of leaders at COP26 will sign the climate change conference's first major deal on Tuesday when they promise to stop deforestation by 2030. Signatories will include Brazil, where large parts of the Amazon rainforest have been cut down, and Indonesia, the world's largest exporter of palm oil. Felling trees contributes to climate change because it depletes forests that absorb vast amounts of the warming gas CO2. More money is also being promised to protect and restore forests.
More than 100 countries say they will sign the deal, covering about 85% of the world's forests. And governments of 28 countries will commit to remove deforestation from the global trade of food and other agricultural products such as palm oil, soya and cocoa. To stop deforestation and break the link between tree loss and agriculture, almost Â£14 billion ($19.2 billion) of public and private funding is being pledged. Some of this will go to developing countries to restore damaged land, tackle wildfire and support indigenous communities. Read morehere. We'll be bringing you coverage of the BBC Global Climate Debate - which begins at 22:35 GMT. Viewers in the UK can watch the programme on BBC One, the BBC iPlayer and by clicking the play button at the top of this page. A panel of leading international political figures has come together to take questions from young people in the studio in Glasgow - and around
the world - on the challenges presented by climate change. Presented by Kirsty Wark, the debate gives young people across the world the chance to hold their leaders to account
on action for climate change. Hilda Flavia Nakabuye, 24, is a climate change activist from Kampala, the Ugandan capital. Her activism was prompted by the impact of climate change on her family's lives, as she explains here: ""When I was still young I had a plantation with my family, but we lost it due to the effects of climate change. Heavy rains, floods, strong winds, unpredictable seasons, dry streams, all these things. ""In 2017 I joined a discussion at my school that was about climate change. I then understood that the effects my family were feeling was because of climate change. ""I started to speak up as a climate activist and as a campaigner. We travelled to schools and communities and in 2019 I started the Fridays For Future movement in Uganda. Now we have a network of 53,000. ""We were arrested a few times by the police because of the climate strikes - they alleged we might be a political party. ""I have very little hope in COP26 because I haven't seen any concrete actions being taken in the last 25 COPs. Many people are being under-represented, especially from the most affected countries, mostly from the global south. ""We are quickly losing our hope in the leaders because of their inaction. Our survival and the survival of the future generations depend on our actions today. ""Itâs either we come up with concrete actions or we fail all generations to come."" Reality Check Indiaâs Prime Minister Narendra Modi has long resisted setting a
date for his country to achieve net zero -  balancing out greenhouse gas emissions with measures to remove them from the
atmosphere. On Monday, he said India would now achieve this by 2070. This is a significantly longer timescale than the UK, EU and the US which have set targets of 2050 to reach this goal. It is also a decade later than Chinaâs 2060 target. Modi also said India would aim to supply 50% of all its
energy requirements from renewable sources by 2030 with a non-fossil fuel
generating capacity of 500 gigawatts (GW). India currently generates a
little over 100GW from non-fossil sources and is unlikely to hit an earlier target
of 175 gigawatts by 2022. Although India has expanded its
capacity to generate power from sources such as wind and solar, it still relies
heavily on coal. It currently powers about 70% of the countryâs electricity
grid. You can read morehereabout India's climate challenge. Prince Charles has been having a busy day at the COP26 summit and appeared to be in good spirits this evening as Boris Johnson praised his environmental efforts over the years. The Prince of Wales spoke to the assembled world leaders this afternoon before a visit to a distillery run by a former drug addict who had been helped by the Prince's Trust charity. Ryan Longmuir, who started Regis Banqueting 18 years ago after receiving a Â£5,000 loan from the charity, handed the prince a glass of whisky and said ""it's great meeting him"". Charles then joined other royals and some of the political leaders ata dinner reception at Glasgow's Kelvingrove Museum. The prince was again seen being handed a drink and this time, Reuters reports, he joked: ""I think I need it after today."" He may have been referring to a moment when he briefly lost his footing as he made his way to the stage to deliver this speech earlier in the day. But one man who apparently didn't think the prince had had a bad day was the UK prime minister. Our political editorLaura Kuenssberg has tweeted,externalthat Boris Johnson complimented the Prince of Wales at the reception, saying: âYou heard me earlier on say this was a job for James Bond. Well we have somebody who drives an electric Aston Martin who has a plan to defuse the ticking time bomb. ""l just want to say you're a prophet without honour and you've been right for a very long time."" Outgoing German Chancellor Angela Merkel said earlier that a comprehensive transformation in ways of working is needed to cut CO2 emissions - and not just action from governments. ""That's why I want to make a clear plea here for carbon pricing. This already exists within the EU and also in China, for example,"" she says. Carbon pricing - effectively a tax on CO2 emissions - has been called for in some industries,such as shipping, as a means of forcing polluting businesses to clean up their trade. Merkel said it would be a way to ensure industries and businesses had an incentive to develop technology that would be better for the global climate. That's a very clear expression of what we need to do in a decisive decade, she said. ""Then we will know how to best arrange CO2-free mobility, CO2-free industry and CO2-free processes of our life."" One of the ways we can reduce our carbon footprint is through what we eat. Switching to a plant-based diet can help fight climate change, according to a major report by the UN's Intergovernmental Panel on Climate Change (IPCC),which says the West's high consumption of meat and dairy is fuelling global warming. If youâre eating beef three to five times a week, over an entire year your consumption is contributing 1,611kg to your annual greenhouse gas emissions. That's the equivalent of driving a regular petrol car 4,112 miles (6,618km), or taking five return flights from London to Malaga. Many are already taking note of this. Daily meat consumption in the UK has fallen by 17% in the past decade,a study has shown.

As the day draws to a close in Glasgow, US President Joe Biden says on Twitter that he hopes those present at the summit ""meet the moment on climate, and kick off a decade of ambition, action, and innovation to preserve our shared future"". ""There's no substitute for face-to-face diplomacy,"" he writes. Biden is among 25,000 delegates from about 200 countries - and from every region in the world - in Glasgow this week, gathered to share plans for how they will cut emissions by 2030. The much-anticipated United Nations gathering is one of the biggest summits the UK has ever hosted. Over two weeks, we can expect a flurry of announcements from countries promising to curb emissions, like switches to electric cars or an expedited phase-out of coal. By the end of the conference, some form of declaration is expected, with every country required to sign on. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Vax declared word of the year for 2021The Oxford English Dictionary said the word had made ""the most striking impact"".Entertainment & Arts","Words related to vaccines, including double-vaxxed, unvaxxed and anti-vaxxer, spiked in frequency in 2021 Vax has been chosen as the word of the year by lexicographers at the Oxford English Dictionary (OED). Words related to vaccines have spiked in frequency in 2021 due to Covid, withdouble-vaxxed,unvaxxedandanti-vaxxerall seeing a surge in use. OED senior editor Fiona McPherson says vax was an obvious choice as it has made ""the most striking impact"". ""It goes back at least to the 1980s, but according to our corpus it was rarely used until this year,"" she said. ""When you add to that its versatility in forming other words -vaxxie,vax-a-thon,vaxinista- it became clear that vax was the standout in the crowd."" Vax and vaxx are both accepted spellings but the form with one x is more common. Oxford English Dictionary definitions for vax: vax n. A vaccine or vaccination vax v. Treat (someone) with a vaccine to produce immunity against a disease; vaccinate vaxxie n. A photograph of oneself taken during or immediately before or after a vaccination, especially one against Covid-19, and typically shared on social media; a vaccination selfie anti-vax adj. Opposed to vaccination anti-vaxxer n. A person who is opposed to vaccination double-vaxxed adj.

Barclays boss steps down over Epstein inquiry,"Barclays boss Jes Staley is ""shell-shocked, angry and upset"" at the conclusion of a probe into his links to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein which has led to his sudden exit from the bank. Insiders close to Mr Staley said he was surprised by City regulators' findings. They have been investigating if Mr Staley's links with the dead financier were closer than first thought. Barclays said it had been made aware of the conclusions of the probe and ""Mr Staley's intention to contest them"". At the heart of Mr Staley's departure is apparently a perceived inconsistency between his account to his own board of his relationship with Epstein and evidence seen by the regulators. Mr Staley insists that while Epstein was an important client of JP Morgan, where Mr Staley worked for a number of years and as such they were in contact regularly, their dealings were well within the grounds that could be described as professional. The BBC understands the regulator took the view that the volume and tone of the emails between the two suggested a closer relationship than the purely professional. But Barclays has stated that the report makes no findings that Mr Staley saw, or was aware of, any of Epstein's crimes. The relationship between a US high net worth individual and his private banker is not like your average relationship with the bank manager. In fact, it would be quite odd if Mr Staley had not visited Epstein at home or indeed vice versa. Nevertheless, the board of Barclays clearly felt that the perceived disconnect between the accounts of the relationship would mean an extended and distracting wrangle with the regulator. Having accepted Mr Staley's promise that he had been totally transparent about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, the board described itself as ""disappointed"", but accepted that it would not be possible for Mr Staley to run the bank while being in open dispute with the regulator. This is not the first time the board of Barclays has been blindsided by Mr Staley. In 2018, he was fined Â£642,000 and Barclays Â£15m after Mr Staley took it upon himself to instruct the bank's own security unit to track down a whistleblower who had raised concerns about the suitability of the appointment of a former colleague of the chief executive. That could have been a straight red card but he escaped with a yellow. The board will also be disappointed because Mr Staley's strategy for the bank seemed to be paying off.  He saw off an activist shareholder challenge to split the investment and retail banks, the investment bank had started delivering good returns and the profits were beating analyst estimates. But ultimately, boards don't like surprises - particularly ones that are perceived to tarnish a reputation and culture they have spent many years trying to rehabilitate. Regulators began investigating the Barclays boss after getting a cache of emails between the men from Mr Staley's former employer. Before joining Barclays the married father-of-two was an executive at US bank JP Morgan, where Epstein, who took his own life in 2019 while in prison, was already a client. Over many years, Epstein, who was convicted of trafficking a minor for prostitution in 2008 and served 13 months in custody, cultivated contact with the rich and powerful, including former US presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump. Who was Jeffrey Epstein? Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates has spoken of his ""huge mistake"" in spending time with Epstein, while the equally super-rich Leon Black stood down from US private equity firm Apollo Global Management over his links. Although Mr Staley, 63, has characterised his relationship with Epstein as professional, with contact starting to ""taper off"" from about 2013, regulators wanted to know whether the emails pointed to a friendlier connection. Mr Staley had already admitted he maintained contact with Epstein for about seven years after his 2008 conviction. And it is also known Mr Staley visited Little St James, a retreat owned by Epstein in the US Virgin Islands in 2015, months before taking the top job at Barclays. In fairness to Mr Staley, he is not the only boss of Barclays to have fallen from grace in recent times. In fact, he is the bank's fifth chief executive in seven years - following in the footsteps of men such asBob Diamond, who resigned over an interest rate-rigging scandal, andAntony Jenkins, who was sacked after falling out with the board over the bank's cost-cutting and profitability. During the pandemic, Mr Staley spoke out against the culture of working from home, saying it was ""not sustainable"". At a virtual meeting of the World Economic Forum, he said: ""It will increasingly be a challenge to maintain the culture and collaboration that these large financial institutions seek to have and should have."" Now Barclays faces the task of maintaining its culture without him - and he may prove a hard act to follow. Read more about Mr Staley here. Mr Staley said last year: ""Obviously I thought I knew him well and I didn't. For sure, with hindsight with what we know now, I deeply regret having any relationship with Jeffrey."" He has yet to comment publicly on Monday's news, but Reuters reported it had seen an internal memo from him indicating he did not want plans to contest the investigation's findings to be a distraction. ""Although I will not be with you for the next chapter of Barclays' story, know that I will be cheering your success from the sidelines,"" the memo reportedly said. Barclays said in a announcement on Monday,externalthat it was ""made aware on Friday evening of the preliminary conclusions from the FCA and the PRA of their investigation into Mr Staley's characterisation to Barclays of his relationship with the late Mr Jeffrey Epstein and the subsequent description of that relationship in Barclays' response to the FCA"". ""In view of those conclusions, and Mr Staley's intention to contest them, the board and Mr Staley have agreed that he will step down. ""It should be noted that the investigation makes no findings that Mr Staley saw, or was aware of, any of Epstein's alleged crimes, which was the central question underpinning Barclays' support for Mr Staley following the arrest of Mr Epstein in the summer of 2019."" Jes Staley visited Little St James, an island own by Jeffrey Epstein, months before he started at Barclays Barclays praised Mr Staley's success at the bank, but added that ""the regulatory process had still to run its full course and it was not appropriate for Barclays to comment further on the preliminary conclusions"". The Financial Conduct Authority (FCA) and the Bank of England's Prudential Regulation Authority (PRA) announced an investigation last year into Mr Staley's ""characterisation to the company of his relationship"" with Epstein. Barclays said last year that following Epstein's death in 2019, Mr Staley had ""volunteered and gave to certain executives, and the chairman, an explanation of his relationship with Mr Epstein"". Jeffrey Epstein died in a New York prison cell in 2019 The probe's conclusions are yet to be made public, but Hargreaves Lansdown's senior investment analyst Susannah Streeter said it seems clear they are critical of Mr Staley. ""Although detail is limited, it appears regulators believe there was a distinct lack of transparency over this relationship,"" she said. ""It's understood Mr Staley will contest the conclusions, and clearly the board want to distance Barclays from what could be a long drawn out process."" Mr Staley has faced regulatory scrutiny before during his six years at Barclays. In 2018, he was fined Â£642,430 by the FCA and PRAfor trying to unmask a whistleblowerwho had raised concerns about a senior executive appointment at the bank's US operation. Many commentators thought the chief executive was lucky to stay in his job. Under the terms of his contract with Barclays, Mr Staley will receive 12 months' pay, totalling Â£2.4m, as well as his pension allowance of Â£120,000 for the year, and any other benefits. He will be replaced as chief executive by Mr C.S. Venkatakrishnan, known as Venkat, subject to regulatory approval. The board said Venkat had been identified as its preferred candidate for the role over a year ago. Reuters said it had seen another internal memo, from Venkat, telling staff Mr Staley's strategy at Barclays was the ""right one"", although he added he would announce changes to the organisation in the coming days. In a statement, the FCA and PRA said they ""do not comment on ongoing investigations or regulatory proceedings beyond confirming the regulatory actions as detailed in the firm's announcement"".

Vax declared word of the year for 2021,"Words related to vaccines, including double-vaxxed, unvaxxed and anti-vaxxer, spiked in frequency in 2021 Vax has been chosen as the word of the year by lexicographers at the Oxford English Dictionary (OED). Words related to vaccines have spiked in frequency in 2021 due to Covid, withdouble-vaxxed,unvaxxedandanti-vaxxerall seeing a surge in use. OED senior editor Fiona McPherson says vax was an obvious choice as it has made ""the most striking impact"". ""It goes back at least to the 1980s, but according to our corpus it was rarely used until this year,"" she said. ""When you add to that its versatility in forming other words -vaxxie,vax-a-thon,vaxinista- it became clear that vax was the standout in the crowd."" Vax and vaxx are both accepted spellings but the form with one x is more common. Oxford English Dictionary definitions for vax: vax n. A vaccine or vaccination vax v. Treat (someone) with a vaccine to produce immunity against a disease; vaccinate vaxxie n. A photograph of oneself taken during or immediately before or after a vaccination, especially one against Covid-19, and typically shared on social media; a vaccination selfie anti-vax adj. Opposed to vaccination anti-vaxxer n. A person who is opposed to vaccination double-vaxxed adj. Having received two doses of a vaccine Use of the word pandemic has also increased by more than 57,000% this year. Oxford Languages and Collins each decide their own word of the year, and in 2020Collins chose ""lockdown"". But Oxford decided it was anunprecedented yearwith too many contenders, so expanded its award to encompass a handful of newly key words includinglockdown,bushfiresandCovid-19, as well asBlack Lives Matter,WFH[working from home],keyworkersandfurlough. This year's Oxford-winning word,vax, was first recorded in English in 1799, while its derivatives vaccinate and vaccination both first appear in 1800. All of these words ultimately come from the Latin word vacca, which means cow. According to the OED, this is due to English physician and scientist Edward Jenner's pioneering work on vaccination against smallpox using cowpox - a mild infection that occurs in cows - in the late 1790s and early 1800s.

Barclays boss steps down over Epstein inquiryJes Staley is leaving the bank following a watchdog investigation into his links to the dead financier.Business,"Barclays boss Jes Staley is ""shell-shocked, angry and upset"" at the conclusion of a probe into his links to sex offender Jeffrey Epstein which has led to his sudden exit from the bank. Insiders close to Mr Staley said he was surprised by City regulators' findings. They have been investigating if Mr Staley's links with the dead financier were closer than first thought. Barclays said it had been made aware of the conclusions of the probe and ""Mr Staley's intention to contest them"". At the heart of Mr Staley's departure is apparently a perceived inconsistency between his account to his own board of his relationship with Epstein and evidence seen by the regulators. Mr Staley insists that while Epstein was an important client of JP Morgan, where Mr Staley worked for a number of years and as such they were in contact regularly, their dealings were well within the grounds that could be described as professional. The BBC understands the regulator took the view that the volume and tone of the emails between the two suggested a closer relationship than the purely professional. But Barclays has stated that the report makes no findings that Mr Staley saw, or was aware of, any of Epstein's crimes. The relationship between a US high net worth individual and his private banker is not like your average relationship with the bank manager. In fact, it would be quite odd if Mr Staley had not visited Epstein at home or indeed vice versa. Nevertheless, the board of Barclays clearly felt that the perceived disconnect between the accounts of the relationship would mean an extended and distracting wrangle with the regulator. Having accepted Mr Staley's promise that he had been totally transparent about his relationship with Jeffrey Epstein, the board described itself as ""disappointed"", but accepted that it would not be possible for Mr Staley to run the bank while being in open dispute with the regulator. This is not the first time the board of Barclays has been blindsided by Mr Staley. In 2018, he was fined Â£642,000 and Barclays Â£15m after Mr Staley took it upon himself to instruct the bank's own security unit to track down a whistleblower who had raised concerns about the suitability of the appointment of a former colleague of the chief executive. That could have been a straight red card but he escaped with a yellow. The board will also be disappointed because Mr Staley's strategy for the bank seemed to be paying off.  He saw off an activist shareholder challenge to split the investment and retail banks, the investment bank had started delivering good returns and the profits were beating analyst estimates. But ultimately, boards don't like surprises - particularly ones that are perceived to tarnish a reputation and culture they have spent many years trying to rehabilitate. Regulators began investigating the Barclays boss after getting a cache of emails between the men from Mr Staley's former employer. Before joining Barclays the married father-of-two was an executive at US bank JP Morgan, where Epstein, who took his own life in 2019 while in prison, was already a client. Over many years, Epstein, who was convicted of trafficking a minor for prostitution in 2008 and served 13 months in custody, cultivated contact with the rich and powerful, including former US presidents Bill Clinton and Donald Trump. Who was Jeffrey Epstein? Microsoft billionaire Bill Gates has spoken of his ""huge mistake"" in spending time with Epstein, while the equally super-rich Leon Black stood down from US private equity firm Apollo Global Management over his links. Although Mr Staley, 63, has characterised his relationship with Epstein as professional, with contact starting to ""taper off"" from about 2013, regulators wanted to know whether the emails pointed to a friendlier connection. Mr Staley had already admitted he maintained contact with Epstein for about seven years after his 2008 conviction. And it is also known Mr Staley visited Little St James, a retreat owned by Epstein in the US Virgin Islands in 2015, months before taking the top job at Barclays. In fairness to Mr Staley, he is not the only boss of Barclays to have fallen from grace in recent times. In fact, he is the bank's fifth chief executive in seven years - following in the footsteps of men such asBob Diamond, who resigned over an interest rate-rigging scandal, andAntony Jenkins, who was sacked after falling out with the board over the bank's cost-cutting and profitability. During the pandemic, Mr Staley spoke out against the culture of working from home, saying it was ""not sustainable"". At a virtual meeting of the World Economic Forum, he said: ""It will increasingly be a challenge to maintain the culture and collaboration that these large financial institutions seek to have and should have."" Now Barclays faces the task of maintaining its culture without him - and he may prove a hard act to follow. Read more about Mr Staley here. Mr Staley said last year: ""Obviously I thought I knew him well and I didn't. For sure, with hindsight with what we know now, I deeply regret having any relationship with Jeffrey."" He has yet to comment publicly on Monday's news, but Reuters reported it had seen an internal memo from him indicating he did not want plans to contest the investigation's findings to be a distraction. ""Although I will not be with you for the next chapter of Barclays' story, know that I will be cheering your success from the sidelines,"" the memo reportedly said. Barclays said in a announcement on Monday,externalthat it was ""made aware on Friday evening of the preliminary conclusions from the FCA and the PRA of their investigation into Mr Staley's characterisation to Barclays of his relationship with the late Mr Jeffrey Epstein and the subsequent description of that relationship in Barclays' response to the FCA"". ""In view of those conclusions, and Mr Staley's intention to contest them, the board and Mr Staley have agreed that he will step down. ""It should be noted that the investigation makes no findings that Mr Staley saw, or was aware of, any of Epstein's alleged crimes, which was the central question underpinning Barclays' support for Mr Staley following the arrest of Mr Epstein in the summer of 2019.""

Climate at 'one minute to midnight' - Johnson,"This video can not be played PM confirms he is not in favour of new UK coal mine The world is at ""one minute to midnight"", having run down the clock on waiting to combat climate change, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said. He was speaking as world leaders arrived for the landmark COP26 climate change conference in Glasgow. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Johnson said leaders needed to move from ""aspiration to action"" to slow global warming. He added the summit was a ""critical"" moment for him, and said an ambitious outcome was still ""in the balance"". For the first time, Mr Johnson also confirmed he did not want to see acontroversial proposed coal mine in Cumbriago ahead. ""I'm not in favour of more coal,"" said the prime minister. ""But it is not a decision for me, it is a decision for the planning authorities."" The government has been criticised for not stopping the mine project going ahead. This is the strongest statement the prime minister has yet made on the subject - and could help negotiations, because persuading nations to phase out coal is one of the central goals the UK government has set for the crucial UN conference. LIVE: Latest updates from COP26 Why the battle for British coal matters to the world The UK is hosting the summit amid mounting concern among scientists that countries are not doing enough to limit the emissions of greenhouse gases, which have caused average global temperatures to rise. The 2015 Paris climate conference called for average temperatures to rise by well below 2C, and preferably only 1.5C, when compared to pre-industrial averages. World leadersarrived at the venuein Glasgow -which has officially become United Nations territory- for the official opening on Monday. Later, they will make statements setting out what their countries are doing on climate change. As UN territory, the venue is being patrolled by armed UN officers and Police Scotland is only allowed to enter if they are invited by the UN secretary general - or if they believe there is a threat to life. Tap or click to go through the gallery  On BBC Breakfast on Monday, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss was asked whether it was necessary for world leaders to fly to the conference - as estimates suggested 400 private planeshad flown into Glasgow. She replied that it was ""fantastic"" that world leaders were there in person. ""When you really get into crunch negotiations, when you want to look somebody in the eye and talk to them face to face, you do need to meet in person,"" she said. ""World leaders are going to have to make some tough decisionsâ¦ they're going to have to commit to things they didn't necessarily want to when they arrived at the conference. That's why it's really important we do have people face to face."" Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon said she understood that the air travel involved may send a ""mixed message"" - but agreed that more progress is made when leaders meet in person. ""Given all of the travel required to get here, it even further increases the pressure on the shoulders of world leaders to make sure it's worth it,"" she said. Ms Sturgeon added that the goal of the conference was to increase countries' ambitions to reduce emissions. ""Right now, the commitments countries have made wouldn't even limit [global warming] to 2C, let alone 1.5."" Planespotters said COP26 was a ""once-in-a-lifetime"" opportunity to spot aircraft not normally seen in Scotland The COP26 summit immediately followed a G20 meeting in Rome - made up of leaders of 20 of the world's biggest economies - whichended on a downbeat note from Mr Johnson,after only 12 of the 20 committed to be carbon neutral by 2050. Speaking to the BBC separately, Mr Johnson promised to add Â£1bn to the money the government has earmarked over the next four years to help developing countries. The government has already conceded that the developed world would not deliver in full on a promise made in 2009 to pay poorer countries $100bn a year to help tackle climate change - roughly equivalent to Â£73bn based on current exchange rates. The government has also been criticised for cutting foreign aid this year. Mr Johnson urged other developed nations to commit more cash. He said the other two central goals of the conference would be persuading world leaders to commit to accelerating the transition away from petrol and diesel cars and to stop deforestation. Climate change is one of the world's most pressing problems.Governments must promise more ambitious cuts in warming gases if we are to prevent greater global temperature rises. The summit in Glasgow is where change could happen.You need to watch for the promises made by the world's biggest polluters, like the US and China, and whether poorer countries are getting the support they need. All our lives will change.Decisions made here could impact our jobs, how we heat our homes, what we eat and how we travel. Read more about the COP26 summit here. Mr Johnson also defended the decision inlast week's Budgetto cut the duty on short-haul internal flights by 50%. He described it as a difficult decision, adding: ""Even the distinguished Scottish politicians who are beating me up about this don't actually themselves come to London by any other means."" The comment appears to be a criticism of the SNP's Westminster leader Ian Blackford. Mr Blackford branded the cut in passenger duty a ""disgrace"" and claimed it was evidence the government did ""not understand the climate challenge"". Mr Johnson told the BBC that drawing more private finance into low carbon investments would be crucial to ensuring a rapid reduction in greenhouse gas emissions. Governments can bring billions to the table, he said, but the market has ""hundreds of trillions"". When asked what the Johnson household was doing to cut its carbon footprint, the prime minister joked that he had ""totally abolished commuting"" when he moved into No 10 and started living above his place of work. He declined to say whether he had cut beef out of his diet, adding he had ""got to start eating a lot less of all kinds of things"". Mr Johnson would not confirm whether he now regarded himself as an environmentalist, but insisted he was ""not the black sheep of my family"" on green issues. Boris Johnson's wife Carrie, his father Stanley and his brother Leo are all very keen environmentalists. The Archbishop of Canterbury said climate change was ""absolutely a moral issue"". ""This is our neighbours all around the world, those who are already suffering catastrophic impacts,"" Justin Welby told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. ""This is life or death."" Mr Welby - who used to work in an oil executive - said he did not regret working in the industry as he ""learnt a huge amount from it"", and added the vast majority of people in the industry are ""pretty passionate about changing"". Additional reporting by Francesca Gillett The COP26 global climate summit in Glasgow in November is seen as crucial if climate change is to be brought under control. Almost 200 countries are being asked for their plans to cut emissions, and it could lead to major changes to our everyday lives.

Hope needed to solve climate change - Drakeford,"Mark Drakeford says people find 'the whole business of climate change dispiriting' The global climate change summit COP26 must deliver ""a sense of hope for people for the future,"" Wales' first minister has said. Action from world leaders would inspire confidence in the public to make changes in their own lives, he claimed. Talks are set to get under way in Glasgow to try and curb global warming. The aim is to cap the rise at an average of 1.5C, with highly damaging impacts forecast if that threshold is breached. Calls for Wales to become a forest nation What the COP26 climate summit could mean for us all Analysis of current plans by the world's countries puts the planet on course for closer to 2.7C of warming by the end of the century. The heating is being driven by excess concentrations of greenhouse gases in the atmosphere, which are mainly produced by burning fossil fuels like coal, oil and gas. Mr Drakeford said it was important for the world to show at COP26 ""this is a problem we can solve"". Poppy Stowell-Evans wants to amplify the voice of young people at the global summit Currently people found ""the whole business of climate change dispiriting,"" he suggested. ""They find the language that is used alienating, they think there is nothing they themselves can do."" The Welsh government is attending COP26 as part of the UK delegation, with the summit itself hosted by the UK government who will lead on top level negotiations. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the conference must ""mark the beginning of the end of climate change"". The former coal villages turning green Droughts and fires 'may become features of Wales' He has called for agreements on phasing out use of coal, stopping deforestation, speeding up the shift to electric transport and more financial support for developing countries. Mr Drakeford told BBC Wales he would be concentrating on meetings with leaders from other ""small nations determined to make a difference"". The Welsh government is part of the Under 2 coalition, a group of 260 state and regional governments that will be represented at the conference. A cross-party delegation of Welsh politician will be heading to Glasgow to join other world leaders He said he wanted ""very much to learn from what people are doing elsewhere to see what we can draw from their experience to make an even bigger difference here in Wales"". ""When the planet is burning that isn't somebody else's problem - that is a problem here in Wales as well,"" he said. ""The extreme weather events that we've seen over recent winters, the fact that our coastline is already being eroded - those problems will only go on getting worse."" A cross-party delegation of Members of the Senedd (MSs) and several Welsh MPs is also heading to the event, which lasts for a fortnight. A really simple guide to climate change Is the UK on track to meet its climate targets? Plaid Cymru's Llyr Gruffydd, chair of the Senedd's climate change committee, said Wales' voice ""must be heard at COP26"". ""Even though Wales is a small country, it can also have a big impact, by setting an example.  We have already seen some progress from the Welsh government, but it needs to start translating its good intentions into decisive actions,"" he said. Meanwhile Welsh business leaders, charities and environmental campaigners are among those setting up stalls at the conference's green zone - a giant exhibition of innovation and ideas to fight climate change. Chair of Wales' Youth Climate Ambassadors programme Poppy Stowell-Evans has been invited to take part in events in both the green zone as well as the blue zone - where the key negotiations are taking place. Mark Drakeford said he would be focussing on meeting other ""small nations determined to make a difference"" The 17-year-old said she and her fellow campaigners wanted to make it clear ""to other young people that conferences like COP are a place for them too"". ""I genuinely think that without the movement of young people climate change wouldn't be so high on world leaders' agendas,"" she said. ""So going to COP I really want to be part of that and to push the voice of young people into an area where they haven't always been represented."" Across Wales, the Welsh Government is hostinga series of events,externalas part of the green zone programme - under the banner COP Cymru. Wales' contribution to the policing effort in Glasgow is also obvious on the city's streets in the form of rows of police vans from Wales marked Heddlu. Some 10,000 officers from across the UK will be deployed each day in and around the conference site.

Bin strikes back on as world leaders arrive for COP26GMB Scotland said the walk out by cleansing and refuse staff in Glasgow would begin at 00:01 on Monday.Glasgow & West Scotland,"Refuse workers and street cleaners are striking for one week A strike by refuse staff and street cleaners in Glasgow has started, as world leaders arrive for the COP26 climate summit. GMB Scotland said members in the city council's cleansing department would be striking for the next week. The union accused the council of failing to give members ""proper time and space"" to consider an offer from local authority body Cosla. Glasgow City Council said the union's decision was ""very disappointing"". They said they would meet with GMB ""at any time"" to resolve the dispute. Bin strikes during COP26 suspended after pay offer Glaswegians greet COP26 with pessimism and hope Rail strike action during COP26 called off Cosla proposed a pay rise of 5.8% for the lowest paid staff as part of a Â£1,062 increase for staff earning below Â£25,000. The deal involved Â£30m from the Scottish government and Â£18.5m from local government. GMB Scotland, Unison and Unite all suspended industrial action on Friday, after the offer was tabled, saying they would consult members. However, on Sunday GMB Scotland confirmed the strike in Glasgow was back on. The union's Drew Duffy told BBC Scotland's Good Morning Scotland programme that the council was ""constantly goading our members"" and they had decided ""enough was enough and the strike continues"". He explained: ""The workforce are the lowest paid workers in Scotland. There are deep rooted problems within Glasgow City Council. We have been trying to meet with the council. ""It is a constant breakdown of industrial relations, there have been longstanding problems with low pay and discriminatory pay and our members have just had enough. The conditions they work in, the pay they receive is not good enough."" Refuse staff and street cleaners on a picket line outside the Dawsholm Recycling Centre in Glasgow on Monday morning The move by the union came as Glasgow geared up to welcome about 120 world leaders to the city for crucial climate talks at COP26. In a statement released on Monday, a Glasgow City Council spokeswoman said: ""The agreement struck at national level gave two weeks to consider the pay offer and so there is no reason for this strike to go ahead at this time. It is very disappointing the GMB has opted for this course of action. ""We have already agreed their request for time to meet with their members. And, while we remain available to meet with them at any time, we are unable to deliver their request for a pay increase. ""That is part of a national negotiation and a new deal was tabled by Cosla last week. ""It appeared that GMB, along with the other unions, had agreed to suspend the strike until national consultation was complete and it is very disappointing they have reneged on that agreement and have not given us the required 14 days' notice after they publicly announced the suspension on Friday."" The GMB, Unison and Unite had initially called for a Â£2,000 pay rise and previously rejected an Â£850-a-year increase for staff earning up to Â£25,000 from Cosla. Gail Macgregor, Cosla's resources spokeswoman, said they put their ""new and improved"" offer to trade unions last week. ""We were pleased to note that that it was accepted with the expectation that strike action be suspended whilst they presented the new offer to their membership for consideration,"" she added. ""GMB in particular made a public statement that they were suspending strike action for a period of two weeks as of Friday whilst the ballot of their members was conducted nationally across all 32 councils that this affects. ""We very much hope that this remains the case and that all members are given the opportunity to participate whilst essential services are maintained."" The GMB previously denied workers were using the global climate conference as a bargaining chip but said staff had been ""put in a corner"" by Cosla despite their efforts during the pandemic and were ""fed up of being disrespected and undervalued by the government"". The Scottish government said it was not party to the pay negotiations, but said it had made a one-off offer of Â£30m in additional funding to help find a solution. Scottish minister Michael Matheson, speaking to BBC Radio Scotland on Monday, said: ""The GMB locally have entered into a dispute now with GCC which I understand is not to do with the actual package itself but it's the process around being able to engage with their members and discuss that with them. ""I understand that discussions were taking place last night and the Scottish government would want to continue to encourage Cosla, GCC and the GMB to continue to discuss this issue and to try and find a quick resolution to what I believe is a process issue rather than an issue around the deal that was proposed.""
