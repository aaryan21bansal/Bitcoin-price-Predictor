Hundreds attend Alesha's farewell,"This video can not be played Mourners wore pink in Alesha's memory Hundreds of mourners have attended the funeral of a six-year-old girl who was killed while on holiday on a Scottish island. Mourners were asked to wear pink to remember Alesha MacPhail, who was found dead after disappearing from her grandmother's home on the Isle of Bute on 2 July. A 16-year-old boy has been charged with her rape and murder. In one of the tributes her uncle described her as ""the brightest thing"". Dozens of bows were tied to the railings of the building while cuddly toys including teddies and unicorns lined the wall outside Coats funeral home in Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire. Six-year-old Alesha MacPhail was laid to rest in North Lanarkshire During the service mourners heard tributes from people close to Alesha including an emotional speech from her uncle Calum MacPhail. He said: ""Alesha would rather hurt than you, she had a great amount of love for absolutely everyone. ""Alesha is everything that I wanted to be, she was kind, caring, smart, I just cannot believe she is gone. ""She was the brightest thing."" Alesha's mother wrote a message which read: ""I love you more than this world"" He was comforted by Alesha's mother Georgina Lochrane, known as Genie, who went up to hug him as he returned to his seat near the schoolgirl's father Robert MacPhail, her younger sister and other family members. Hundreds of people later lined the streets as the funeral cortege travelled to Coltswood Cemetery, where she was laid to rest. Emma Gibson, Alesha's class teacher at Chapelside Primary School in nearby Airdrie, also spoke at the service. She said: ""Alesha was a bright and bubbly little girl, she always came into class with that big beautiful smile of hers. ""It was an absolute pleasure to have taught Alesha. I'm so grateful to have known this special little girl."" Head teacher Wendy Davie said: ""May your smile shine brightly wherever you are, you will always be remembered as our Chapelside star."" Robert MacPhail's girlfriend Toni McLachlan also gave a tribute, saying: ""Sleep tight, little angel."" Alesha, who was from Airdrie, had been staying at her grandmother's house on Bute when she was reported missing. She was a few days into a three-week summer break on the island in the Firth of Clyde, west of Glasgow. Floral tributes were laid for Alesha's funeral in Coatbridge The service was led by funeral director Fraser MacGregor, who said Alesha was an amazing and talented little girl and the ""best big sister, best daughter, best granddaughter and friend that anyone could have asked for"". He said that Alesha will always be remembered as a ""very loving girl, friendly, good natured and full of love"" who enjoyed everything from doing gymnastics and riding her bike to baking cakes, listening to music and watching Peppa Pig. Mr MacGregor also said that Alesha was fascinated by bubbles and had always wanted a bubble party on her birthday. As music played at the end of the service a bubble machine sent bubbles drifting above the mourners' heads. A candlelit vigil for Alesha was held in Rothesay on Bute earlier this month and an online fundraiser set up to support relatives reached almost Â£13,000.

"'Trade war a reality', says French minister","The Trump administration says protecting US steel and aluminium producers is a matter of national security A trade war is now a reality, French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire has warned as G20 ministers gather for a summit in Argentina. The current US trade policy of imposing unilateral tariffs is based on ""the law of the jungle"", he said. But US Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin defended the tariffs and urged the EU and China to open their markets to allow free competition. Last week,US President Donald Trump described the EU as a ""foe"" on trade. Mr Trump later threatened to impose tariffs on all $500bn (Â£380bn) of Chinese goods entering the USin a growing trade row. The US has large trade deficits with both the 28-member EU and China. The two-day talks in Buenos Aires bring together finance ministers and central bankers of the world's top 20 economies. What is a trade war and why should I worry? G7 summit ends in disarray over tariffs Who is losing out from Trump's tariffs? ""World trade cannot base itself on the law of the jungle and the unilateral increase of tariffs is the law of the jungle,"" Mr Le Maire told AFP news agency. Partners or foes? Steven Mnuchin (left) and Bruno Le Maire at the G20 meeting in Buenos Aires ""The law of the fittest - this cannot be the future of global trade relations. The law of the jungle will only turn out losers, it will weaken growth, threaten the most fragile countries and have disastrous political consequences."" He added that a trade war was now a reality, and that the EU could not consider negotiating a free trade deal with the US without America first withdrawing its tariffs on steel and aluminium. Mr Mnuchin said it was pretty simple. ""My message is pretty clear, it's the same message the president delivered at the G7 (last month in Canada): if Europe believes in free trade, we're ready to sign a free trade agreement with no tariffs, no non-tariff barriers and no subsidies. It has to be all three,"" he said. Mr Mnuchin said China had to open its markets ""so we can compete fairly"". ""We share a desire to have a more balanced relationship and the balanced relationship is by us selling more goods [to China],"" he said. Little has caused Donald Trump more annoyance than the trading deficits between the US and its major partners. He believes that if you have a trade deficit - if you import more than you export - you are losing out. Tackling what he has called ""unfair trading practices"" has become a key plank of his administration. The European Union, China and the North American Free Trade Agreement (Nafta) countries, Mexico and Canada, have been his main targets. Mr Trump has pulled out of theTrans-Pacific Partnership (TPP) trade dealandwants a renegotiated Nafta deal. US tariffs a dangerous game, says EU January:The US slaps tariffs on imported washing machines and solar panels June:The Trump administration introduces tariffs of 25% on steel and 10% on aluminium imported into the US, arguing that global oversupply, driven by China, threatens American producers. The EU enacts retaliatory tariffs on a range of US goods, including bourbon whiskey, Harley Davidson motorcycles and orange juice July:A 25% tariff affecting $34bn (Â£25.7bn) of Chinese goods begins.

Trump: EU is a foe on trade,"This video can not be played President Trump describes EU as a foe in an interview with CBS. US President Donald Trump has described the European Union as a foe on trade. He told CBS News that European countries were taking advantage of the US and not paying their Nato bills. EU Council President Donald Tusk said anyone calling the EU foes was spreading ""fake news"". Mr Trump said he had ""low expectations"" for his meeting on Monday with Russia's Vladimir Putin, which comes after12 Russians were indicted for alleged hackingduring 2016 US elections. Mr Trump said he would raise this issue with Mr Putin at the summit in the Finnish capital, Helsinki, and ""maybe some good"" would come of it. Russia denies the allegations. There have been calls in the US for Mr Trump to cancel his meeting with Mr Putin over the indictments, announced on Friday by US Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein. Sunday also saw a protest march against the summit in Helsinki. Demonstrators chanted ""media must be free"", and carried a banner calling for human rights.

Asked to name his biggest competitor and foe globally, the US president said there were ""a lot of foes"" and named Russia and China among them, but the first on his list was the EU. Mr Trump described the EU as ""very difficult"" ""I think the European Union is a foe, what they do to us in trade. Now you wouldn't think of the European Union but they're a foe,"" he said.

He then returned to the theme of Germany's reliance on Nord Stream 2, a pipeline which will increase the flow of gas to EU states and which he controversially criticised ahead of last week's Nato summit. He said: ""There's a lot of anger at the fact that Germany is paying Russia billions of dollars."" He also accused Germany of ""waving a white flag"".

""That's what one of the purposes of this meeting is, so the president can see eye to eye with President Putin and ask him about it,"" he said. ""He'll listen to President Putin's response, and we'll go from there."" Mr Trump also repeated his earlier criticism of the Obama administration, which was in power when the alleged hacking of Democratic party officials took place. ""This was during the Obama administration. They were doing whatever it was during the Obama administration,"" he said. ""The DNC should be ashamed of themselves for allowing themselves to be hacked. They had bad defences and they were able to be hacked,"" he added. He said he had been told ""by a number of people"" that hackers had also targeted the Republican party but ""we had much better defences"", although he added that ""this may be wrong"". The US president has taken in a Nato summit and a visit to the UK ahead of his meeting with Mr Putin. The visit has been controversial because of a newspaper interview in which he said the US would probably not give the UK a trade deal under the terms of Prime Minister May's Brexit plans, and also said Europe was ""losing its character"" because of immigration from Africa and the Middle East.

Call for move to ban real fur salesIt comes as MPs investigate why real fur has been sold as fake on the UK's high streets.UK Politics,"This model is wearing a fake fur jacket - now sales of real fur could be banned A ban on sales of real fur should be considered, a committee of MPs has recommended. The Environment, Food and Rural Affairs (Efra) Committee investigation into the issue came after some real fur was found wrongly labelled as fake.

The government said Brexit would allow the UK to ""go further"" when it came to introducing further restrictions on the fur trade. Is your fur faux or real? Retailers criticised over fur mis-selling Labour party pledges to ban fur imports Fur farming was banned in the UK in 2000, but it is legal to sell some types of real fur that have been imported, if it is accurately labelled. But the Efra committee said retailers and Trading Standards had been complacent about items being incorrectly labelled. Their inquiry came after it emerged High Street and online retailers including TK Maxx, BooHoo, Amazon and Tesco had recently sold real fur as fake. Other retailers found to have passed items off as faux fur included Not on the High Street, Groupon, Etsy, FatFace, Boots, Kurt Geiger and Romwe. This video can not be played The difference between real and fake fur The Efra committee started its investigation in February, when cases of mislabelling came to light via reports from media and campaign groups. The MPs found that while many of the retailers concerned had no-fur policies, the so-called faux fur had actually come from animals including rabbit, fox and chinchilla. It said Brexit could be an opportunity to tighten regulations around the sale of fur and called for a consultation on a bar on the sale of all real fur. ""Many consumers have an ethical reason for not buying garments containing real fur,"" the committee's report said. ""The last few years have shown that there is vulnerability in retailers' supply chains and that real fur has been sold as fake fur. ""Our inquiry has highlighted that the current labelling system is confusing, not fit for purpose and with a high degree of non-compliance. It is also not being enforced."" The committee recognised that fur is ""a subject that raises strong feelings"", adding: ""In looking at whether to ban the sale and import of fur post-Brexit, the government will have to balance the needs of animal welfare against consumer choice."" Emotions can run high on the subject of real fur Committee chairman Neil Parish said: ""Reports of real fur being sold as fake fur shows that retailers are flouting their responsibility to consumers. ""The mis-selling of real fur should not be discovered by campaign organisations and the media, but by Trading Standards officers and retailers. ""Retailers of all sizes are complacent about the issue of fake faux fur. It is illegal to give misleading information and Trading Standards have been poor at identifying and acting against those who are doing so."" He recommended that the government should make sure local authorities had the proper resources, and Trading Standards adequate training, to help bring an end to the issue. ""Brexit provides an opportunity to step up our game when it comes to labelling,"" added Mr Parish, Conservative MP for Riverton and Honiton. ""The labelling of clothes must be consistent, transparent and customer-friendly, but current EU requirements are not good enough to allow consumers to understand the origin and contents of their clothing."" The British Fur Trade Association said it welcomed the committee's recommendations on addressing the problems of mis-selling fur and agreed the current European labelling was not fit for purpose. Chief executive Mike Moser said it was vital that consumers were able to make informed decisions, whether they were buying natural or fake fur. He wants to see a fur-specific label introduced on to the UK market which would give greater detail about the type of fur used. However, he said he was disappointed that the committee was recommending a possible trade ban,  despite acknowledging that the fur industry was a legitimate business and wearing fur was a matter of consumer choice.

India scraps tampon tax after campaign,"The introduction of the 12% ""blood tax"" sparked protests across India India has scrapped its 12% tax on all sanitary products following months of campaigning by activists. The announcement comes a year after the government introduced the tax, known as GST, on all goods - including the 12% duty on menstrual hygiene products. Campaigners argued the tax would make them even more unaffordable in a country where an estimated four out of five women and girls already have no access to items like sanitary pads. The news was welcomed by campaigners. Surbhi Singh, founder of Sachhi Saheli, a menstrual health awareness charity, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation: ""This was a most-awaited and necessary step to help girls and women to stay in school, their jobs, to practise proper menstrual hygiene. ""This will help them to grow, to show their true potential."" Periods are one of the leading reasons why girls drop out of education in India, while many others are forced to stay at home because they can't access sanitary products. Some women use cloth or rags - which, if not clean, can increase the risk of infections. The Bollywood film breaking the taboo around periods Watch: The boys making sanitary pads The people fighting pollution with plastic-free periods So when the government branded tampons and sanitary pads a luxury item, with a 12% tax,it sparked an immediate campaign to get the measure revoked, including court challenges and petitions - one of which got more than 400,000 signatures. It was known as Lahu ka Lagaan in Hindi, which translates as ""blood tax"". The announcement their campaign had been successful was made by India's interim finance minister, Piyush Goyal, who said he was ""sure all mothers and sisters will be very happy to hear that sanitary pads are now 100% exempt from tax"". Campaigner Amar Tulsiyan, founder of Niine Movement, went further, saying it was ""a big win for everyone"" in India. Period poverty is not only a problem affecting women in India. According to charity Plan International UK, one in 10 disadvantaged girls below the age of 21 cannot afford sanitary products. The UK still has a 5% tax, despite campaigners calling for it to be scrapped.

Spieth leads Open as Woods impressesDefending champion Jordan Spieth leads The Open with a stunning third round as Tiger Woods moves into contention.BBC SportComments,"This video can not be played Open 2018: Tiger Woods cards his lowest major score since 2011 The 147th Open Championship: Third-round leaderboard -9J Spieth (US), X Schauffele (US), K Kisner (US);-7K Chappell (US);-6F Molinari (Ita);-5T Woods (US), W Simpson (US), A Noren (Swe), M Kuchar (US), R McIlroy (NI), T Fleetwood (Eng), Z Johnson (US) Selected others: -4J Rose (Eng), A Scott (Aus);-3C Wood (Eng), D Willett (Eng);-1B Langer (Ger), P Mickelson (US), E Pepperell (Eng), R Fowler (US) Defending champion Jordan Spieth has a share of The Open lead after a faultless third round with Tiger Woods also in contention at Carnoustie. American Spieth, 24, shot a six-under 65 as he bids to become the first man to retain the Claret Jug since 2008. Kevin KisnerandXander Schauffeleare also nine under par, withRory McIlroyandTommy Fleetwoodon five under. Woods shot his lowest round at a major since 2011 as a five-under-par 66 put him alongside McIlroy and Fleetwood. Making his first Open appearance since 2015, Woods sunk six birdies to take a share of a six-way lead at one point. The 42-year-old American dropped his only shot on the 16th to fall back to five-under overall, but remains in contention to challenge on Sunday after showing glimpses of the game which has won him 14 majors. Now ranked 71st in the world after starting the year in 650th, Woods has not won a major since the 2008 US Open. Italy'sFrancesco Molinarimatched Spieth's 65 to finish six under after 54 holes, with only England'sJustin Rosecarding a lower third-round score to move to four under. Rose shoots career-best 64 Third-round leaderboard Final round tee times The Cut: Download the BBC golf podcast This video can not be played Rose caps off incredible round of 64 with two birdies Spieth is bidding to emulate Padraig Harrington by winning back-to-back Open titles at Carnoustie and Royal Birkdale, a decade on from the Irishman's two triumphs on the same courses. The three-time major winner had struggled for his best form since finishing third at the Masters in April, but proved once again he has the talent and mindset to produce when it matters most. He showed his intent on the first hole, a near 400-yard par four, with an aggressive drive that reached the green and enabled him to convert a 10-foot putt for an eagle. A birdie on the fourth put him into a share of the lead, eventually taking the outright lead with a two on the par-three 16th - his third birdie in six holes. Another half chance on the last slipped by, Spieth having to settle for a par and a round of 65 which equals his lowest score at an Open. ""I know as well as anyone that anything can happen in the Open. I'm not getting ahead of myself, I'm just in a good position,"" said the Texan. This video can not be played Co-leader Jordan Spieth shoots 'world class' 65 at Carnoustie Excitement mounted on the Scottish links as Woods climbed the leaderboard, with large numbers following the former world number one around the course and whoops of support greeting virtually every shot. The three-time Open champion was level par for the tournament at the start of the round, but took full advantage of perfect scoring conditions. Birdies on the fourth and sixth provided a solid platform, before a run of three more on nine, 10 and 11 put him into contention. Woods took another opportunity at the par-five 14th to top a major leaderboard for the first time since the Masters in 2013. After a missed birdie putt on the 15th denied him the outright lead, he dropped from the leading pack after missing the green on the par-three 16th to record the only blemish on his card. A stray drive was fortunate to avoid the Barry Burn on the last, but a safe second and neat approach allowed him to convert a par for his lowest round at a major since a 66 at the 2011 Masters. England's Ian Poulter, who missed the cut, labelled Woods as the 'Greatest of All Time' McIlroy, 29, is bidding for his first major title since winning the 2014 PGA Championship and put himself in a good position with successive rounds of 69. However, the Northern Irishman was unable to significantly build on that in benign conditions on Saturday. The four-time major winner was two shots off the lead at seven under before two bogeys in the final three holes left him rueing a ""frustrating"" finish. ""I felt walking on to 16 at three under that was good,"" said McIlroy. This video can not be played I need a fast start tomorrow - McIlroy ""I am disappointed to drop a couple in the last three holes and I will try to make up for it and try to catch the leaders. ""I would love to be two behind going into the last day instead of four, but there are a lot of guys in with a chance and the wind will be stronger tomorrow and that will give a lot of people hope."" Fleetwood, 27, said he was disappointed with a level-par round of 71 which saw five birdies wiped out by three bogeys and a double bogey. The Englishman, ranked 10th in the world, set the course record of 63 at Carnoustie last year and believes he will need to go close to that mark if he is to win a first major title. ""That's the good thing, that I can draw on the fact that I have low rounds in me and success on this golf course,"" he said. This video can not be played Huge drives and delicate chips in shots of the day Ken Brown, BBC commentator and former European Tour player: What an unbelievable day's golf. So many birdies, so many putts holed. The leaderboard has swayed around all over the place. Fantastic. Jordan Spieth was in command all day long. He set the tone with his amazing tee shot on the first that went 400 yards. The defending champion reads these greens so well and was at his imperious best. Tiger Woods marched through the field, which was a joy to watch. He played with total focus, total concentration, knew what was required of him and produced it really well. He hit an endless supply of solid shots and some ripping drives when he needed to. It was as good a round as he could have played and he looked back to his best. As for Rory McIlroy, he would definitely say this was a day of missed opportunities. He hit a lot of long tee shots, he didn't enter the rough too often, but he couldn't hole enough putts. He would have hoped to have broken 70 the way he hit the ball off the tee. However, he is still very much in the hunt and lives to fight another day. Sunday is entirely weather dependent. With wind forecast there are 35 players who will think that if they have the round of their lives early on before the winds hit they have a real chance. Anything could happen on a windy day in Carnoustie...

"Toblerone to revert to original shapeMakers scrap the 150g bar, likened to a bike rack, in favour of a heavier one in its traditional shape.UK","The 150g Toblerone featured larger gaps between its distinctive triangles Makers of the Swiss chocolate bar, Toblerone, are to scrap its latest incarnation which saw wide gaps between its distinctive triangular chunks. That version was introduced in 2016 to reduce its weight but drew criticism, with some likening it to a bike rack. US-based Mondelez International said the new shape had not been a ""perfect long-term answer"" for its customers. Now it plans to increase the current size from 150g to 200g and revert to making it in its traditional shape. When the downsized version was first released, the makers blamed a rise in the cost of ingredients and said they had to make a decision between changing the look or raising the price. But the new widely-spaced triangles in the lighter bar left fans feeling cheated. OnToblerone's Facebook page,external, Louise Bennett wrote: ""After a busy day at work I decided to treat myself. I was super excited, until I opened it and discovered half of the pieces missing!"" And Scott Blackadder wrote: ""I was eating mine today and lost my shoe. I found it in one of the gaps in my Toblerone."" Prince George celebrates fifth birthday M1 breakdown driver 'had somewhere to be' The truth about our shrinking snacks Asked whether falling sales were behind the return to the original shape, Mondelez said sales of the 150g bar increased after the shape was changed and 2017 was a ""fantastic year"" for Toblerone. Manufacturing has now ceased on 150g bars, the firm added. It is unclear what the retail price will be of the new 200g bar, due to be on the shelves later this year. Toblerones also come in 100g bars, which retail at Â£1.63, and in 360g bars for Â£5.49.

"India scraps tampon tax after campaignThe government introduced a 12% levy on sanitary products last year, sparking outrage.India","The introduction of the 12% ""blood tax"" sparked protests across India India has scrapped its 12% tax on all sanitary products following months of campaigning by activists. The announcement comes a year after the government introduced the tax, known as GST, on all goods - including the 12% duty on menstrual hygiene products. Campaigners argued the tax would make them even more unaffordable in a country where an estimated four out of five women and girls already have no access to items like sanitary pads. The news was welcomed by campaigners. Surbhi Singh, founder of Sachhi Saheli, a menstrual health awareness charity, told the Thomson Reuters Foundation: ""This was a most-awaited and necessary step to help girls and women to stay in school, their jobs, to practise proper menstrual hygiene. ""This will help them to grow, to show their true potential."" Periods are one of the leading reasons why girls drop out of education in India, while many others are forced to stay at home because they can't access sanitary products. Some women use cloth or rags - which, if not clean, can increase the risk of infections. The Bollywood film breaking the taboo around periods Watch: The boys making sanitary pads The people fighting pollution with plastic-free periods So when the government branded tampons and sanitary pads a luxury item, with a 12% tax,it sparked an immediate campaign to get the measure revoked, including court challenges and petitions - one of which got more than 400,000 signatures.

Nine US tour boat victims from same family,"This video can not be played The victims were remembered at a candlelit vigil The 17 victims who died when a tour boat sank in a Missouri lake on Thursday included nine members of one family, officials in the US state say. A surviving relative told US media that the boat's captain had told the 31 passengers not to put on life jackets. The amphibious ""duck boat"" capsized during a rapidly deteriorating thunderstorm on Table Rock Lake, a popular tourist attraction. Missouri Highway Patrol said the ages of the deceased range from one to 70. The woman who says she lost nine members of her family has been named as Tia Coleman. She is one of two in her family to have survived. ""I lost all my children, I lost my husband, I lost my mother-in-law, I lost my father-in-law, I lost my uncle, I lost my sister-in-law - she was my sister - and I lost my nephew, I'm OK, but this is really hard,"" she told Fox News. ""The captain told us 'Don't worry about grabbing the life jackets, you won't need them,' so nobody grabbed them because we listened to the captain and he told us to stay seated. ""However in doing that, when it was time to grab them it was too late. I believe that a lot of people could have been spared."" A relative who was not on the boat told WSB-TV that the other member of the family who survived was a boy, the station said in a tweet. Allow Twitter content?

He is now in a hospital. The vessel began taking on water shortly before 19:00 (00:00 GMT) on Thursday. Video footage shot by a witness on shore showed two duck boats struggling through choppy waters and spray. One of the boats made it to shore but the other was driven back by the wind and eventually overwhelmed. Missouri governor Mike Parson (left) and Stone County Sheriff Doug Rader speaking with reporters on Friday Sheriff Doug Rader told reporters he could not say whether passengers were wearing life vests at the time of the capsizing, or if the boat's windows were open. Missouri law,externalrequires all children under the age of seven to wear life jackets on boats, unless they are in the ""cabin area"". The vessel sank in 40ft (12m) of water before plunging to a final depth of 80ft. 'Placid'lake The vessel was on the water after a weather warning was issued. But the owner of the tour boat company, Jim Pattison, said he had been told by employees that the storm had ""came out of basically nowhere"". ""Usually the lake is very placid and it's not a long tour, they go in and kind of around an island and back. We had other boats in the water earlier and it had been a great, sort of calm experience,"" he said. Footage posted on social media shows a duck boat battling severe weather on Table Rock Lake Passenger boat sinks in Colombia Video: Paddle steamer sinks into sea Mr Pattison also said that under Missouri law passengers are not required to wear life jackets. The accident happened as thunderstorms rolled through the American Midwest, uprooting trees and felling power lines. At the time of the accident, winds reached around 65mph (104 km/h), according to the National Weather Service. There are hundreds of so-called duck boats in use around the world. The amphibious vehicles are popular with tourists and have been providing tours for decades. Five people were killed when a bus collided with a tour vehicle in Seattle The most serious incident was in 1999, whena duck boat listed and sank just minutes after entering Lake Hamilton in Arkansas,external. Thirteen people were killed, including three children, after they became trapped beneath the vehicle's canopy. The cause was later reported to be ""uncontrolled flooding"" due to a loose part. The sightseeing vehicles are based on a design used during World War Two to transport personnel and supplies over land and water - known as the DUKW. The DUKW, a six-wheel-drive amphibious truck, was first made in the US in the mid-1940s to deliver people and materials ashore where no port facilities existed. Some 21,000 DUKWs were produced for use during the war. Many served on D-Day and in the Normandy landings.

PayPoint customers left without energy,"Customers were left without gas and electricity after PayPoint terminals across the country went down. Users of the network, which lets people pre-pay for energy at some shops and supermarkets, complained about freezers thawing and having no electricity. Complaints were made on social media on Saturday, before PayPoint later said the service was back to normal. The company, which has terminals in more than 50,000 UK stores, had advised retailers to reset their devices. PayPoint apologised for the inconvenience, saying it had been ""working hard"" to fix the problem. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Smart meters to cut bills 'by just ÃÂ£11'MPs say smart meters will not deliver expected savings and their rollout will not meet a deadline.,"People who have smart meters installed are expected to save an average of Â£11 annually on their energy bills, much less than originally hoped. A report from a parliamentary group now predicts a dual fuel saving of Â£26. In a critical report, the 92 MPs and peers also saidthe government was likely to miss its own deadline,externalto have the Â£11bn switchover completed. Up to 53 million smart meters were to be installed in 30 million homes and businesses by the end of 2020. A smart meter is designed to replace traditional gas and electricity meters. It automatically sends usage data to suppliers via the mobile phone network, and comes with a display showing users how much energy they are using - and the cost in pounds and pence. Conservative MP Grant Shapps, the chairman of the British Infrastructure Group (BIG), said the programme had been ""plagued by repeated delays and cost increases, with suppliers now almost certain to miss the 2020 deadline, and programme benefits likely to be slashed even further"". Speaking on BBC Radio 4's Today programme, Mr Shapps said one of the reasons for the ""mess"" was that ""first generation"" smart meters, which do not always work when a customer switches supplier, will continue to be rolled out until next year. He added: ""We need to shift to a reliable timetable, we need to quit installing obsolete old meters... and we need to have the regulator become a lot tougher."" The government said smart meters were already putting consumers in control of their energy use, while industry body Energy UK said suppliers were committed to meeting the deadline of seeing all households and businesses offered a smart meter by 2020. Watchdog to review smart meter roll-out Will smart meters be worth the money? Smart Energy GB, which is promoting the roll out of the smart meters, said: ""All smart meters mean an end to estimated billing and give people a greater understanding of their energy use. ""Smart meters are also making prepay cheaper and more convenient, bringing the way we pay for our energy up-to-date, enabling customers to top up online or over the phone."" This video can not be played Grant Shapps: Messy delivery means households are losing out on smart meter benefits Customers have financed the smart meter programme by paying a levy on their energy bills, while suppliers have frequently blamed the levy for rising costs. However, the report claimed most of the eventual savings would be made by energy firms, rather than consumers. ""The roll-out is consequently at serious risk of becoming yet another large scale public infrastructure project delivered well over time and budget, and which fails to provide energy customers with a meaningful return on their investment,"" said Mr Shapps. By Roger Harrabin, BBC environment analyst Smart meters are supposed to play a major part in the UK's clean vehicle revolution by allowing electric cars to charge overnight when wind power is strong, demand is low, and energy is cheap. It's just as well, as by 2030 the government wants half of new cars to be powered by electricity or fuel cells as part of a global move to combat climate change and clean up pollution. The promise of variable charging has encouraged National Grid to re-assure the public that supplying extra energy for vehicles won't be a big deal. So far so good. But it's alleged that many of the first generation smart meters won't be intelligent enough to offer sophisticated variable rate charging. Energy saving expert Andrew Warren says that means extra energy will need to be generated to charge electric cars - which will put up costs for everyone. Follow Rogeron Twitter,external The MPs also said some suppliers had been engaging in ""scare tactics"" to convince customers to have a meter installed, in order for targets to be reached. Such tactics included firms telling customers that their bills would go up unless they agreed to have a meter, or that their old meter was dangerous. The report also said that: More than half of smart meters ""go dumb"" after switching, meaning they stop communicating with the supplier Up to 10% of smart meters don't work, because they are in areas where mobile phone signals are not strong enough By the end of the year only 22% of households will have the meters installed, meaning the 2020 deadline is certain to be missed The eventual cost of the programme could even outweigh the benefits The report said the government should now plan for the roll-out to be completed by 2022, and that supply of the new generation of smart meters should be sped up. They also said customers should be automatically compensated for each day their meter malfunctions. A spokesman for the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy said the smart meter roll out was part of plans to drive more competition and consumer choice. He said an annual saving of Â£11 per bill equated to an overall reduction of Â£300m, and this was expected reach Â£1.2bn, or Â£47 per household, by 2030. However the government said it was wrong to call dumb meters ""obsolete"". ""They offer smart services now and will continue do so as they are enrolled into the smart metering network,"" he said. ""However we welcome ideas on how to ensure the ongoing success of the smart meter roll out and are already working with Ofgem on issues raised in the report."" The National Audit Office is already investigating the economic case for the roll-out of smart meters, and is due to report sometime this summer. Energy UK said: ""Suppliers have installed more than 11 million smart meters. However, as with any large and complex infrastructure programme there will be challenges to overcome.""

"Newsreader makes hearing aid debutLewis Vaughan Jones, 37, feared his career was over after he suddenly lost the hearing in one ear.","This video can not be played Lewis Vaughan Jones: ""It was crowded and loud on air"" A newsreader who suddenly lost the hearing in his left ear, has received messages of support after his first appearance on air with a hearing aid. Lewis Vaughan Jones, 37, feared his career presenting the news on the BBC and ITN was over after doctors told him the hearing loss was permanent. ""That was the darkest moment,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live. He also spoke of his embarrassment in social situations and the difficulties of coming to terms with a hearing aid. Vaughan Jones had good hearing all his life until he got a cold several months ago and couldn't hear in one ear. Doctors found his left eardrum was no longer working and the nerve which takes sound to the brain had given up, he told BBC Breakfast. When they told him the sudden hearing loss and the tinnitus were permanent,  he walked out of hospital ""completely bamboozled"", he added. Why you should get your hearing checked Video: 'I have a magnet in my head' The charity Action on Hearing Loss says about 11m people in the UK have some form of hearing loss, and 2m use hearing aids.  It estimates that there are about 6.7m people who could benefit from hearing aids. Before being fitted with a hearing aid, Vaughan Jones said his situation had left him frustrated and embarrassed. ""There's only so many times you can interrupt. You feel embarrassed so you withdraw,"" he said. He also described how he would smile and nod along when spending time with friends and family, feeling unable to engage and as though he was missing out. His hearing aid, he said, has been a massive help, allowing him to return to work. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

His return to screen, however, was a noisy one as he can hear the director and correspondents through an earpiece in his right ear and an amplified, distorted version of his own voice through the hearing aid in his left. The brain should learn to quieten down that distortion, he said. Getting used to wearing a hearing aid has not come easy. ""I was self-conscious about it. My hair is slightly longer so that's a reflection that I might have been trying to hide it,"" he adds. Now back on air, he wants to show everyone he is wearing one. ""There's no logical reason why I shouldn't wear my hearing aid on air and feel good about it,"" he said. Some took to Twitter to agree. Allow Twitter content?

Newsreader makes hearing aid debut,"This video can not be played Lewis Vaughan Jones: ""It was crowded and loud on air"" A newsreader who suddenly lost the hearing in his left ear, has received messages of support after his first appearance on air with a hearing aid. Lewis Vaughan Jones, 37, feared his career presenting the news on the BBC and ITN was over after doctors told him the hearing loss was permanent. ""That was the darkest moment,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live. He also spoke of his embarrassment in social situations and the difficulties of coming to terms with a hearing aid. Vaughan Jones had good hearing all his life until he got a cold several months ago and couldn't hear in one ear. Doctors found his left eardrum was no longer working and the nerve which takes sound to the brain had given up, he told BBC Breakfast. When they told him the sudden hearing loss and the tinnitus were permanent,  he walked out of hospital ""completely bamboozled"", he added. Why you should get your hearing checked Video: 'I have a magnet in my head' The charity Action on Hearing Loss says about 11m people in the UK have some form of hearing loss, and 2m use hearing aids.  It estimates that there are about 6.7m people who could benefit from hearing aids. Before being fitted with a hearing aid, Vaughan Jones said his situation had left him frustrated and embarrassed. ""There's only so many times you can interrupt. You feel embarrassed so you withdraw,"" he said. He also described how he would smile and nod along when spending time with friends and family, feeling unable to engage and as though he was missing out. His hearing aid, he said, has been a massive help, allowing him to return to work. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

His return to screen, however, was a noisy one as he can hear the director and correspondents through an earpiece in his right ear and an amplified, distorted version of his own voice through the hearing aid in his left. The brain should learn to quieten down that distortion, he said. Getting used to wearing a hearing aid has not come easy. ""I was self-conscious about it. My hair is slightly longer so that's a reflection that I might have been trying to hide it,"" he adds. Now back on air, he wants to show everyone he is wearing one. ""There's no logical reason why I shouldn't wear my hearing aid on air and feel good about it,"" he said. Some took to Twitter to agree. Allow Twitter content?

Robbie M said he started wearing two hearing aids five years ago after finding he was unable to hear in meetings.

The celebrities 'banned' from ThatcherÃ¢ÂÂs party,"Files just released show how in 1988 Denis Thatcher personally vetted the guest list for a showbiz reception at Number 10, providing an insight into the thoughts of one of the most taciturn of prime ministerial consorts. On 7 June 1987, just days before the general election, the Conservatives held a rally in Wembley. On the stage with the prime minister were 45 celebrities, rounded up by the entrepreneur and Conservative fundraiser Sir Basil Feldman. They included some of the biggest names in TV at the time, including Ronnie Corbett, Jimmy Tarbuck, Bob Monkhouse and Shirley Bassey. Mrs Thatcher won, of course, and a few months later decided to give a party to thank her showbiz supporters. Forty-five guests would not fill up the grand reception rooms at Number 10 Downing Street, so the list,now revealed by the Thatcher Archive,external, was expanded. Although she appeared at the Wembley rally, a red question mark was placed against Shirley Bassey's name John Whittingdale, then Mrs Thatcher's political secretary, suggested Paul McCartney, Cliff Richard, Freddie Mercury and Mick Jagger as guests. The first two made the list, drawn up by the ministry for the arts: government ministers were added, as were civil list pensioners and sportsmen and women. Sir Denis Thatcher dies,external Margaret Thatcher: From grocerâs daughter to Iron Lady Obituary: Margaret Thatcher This guest list, which contained 229 names, not including spouses, was copied by Mrs Thatcher's private office to Denis Thatcher, who was to co-host the party. He wrote back: ""Whilst I accept of course that not everyone who comes to our receptions are necessarily on our side I find it both unpleasant and embarrassing to entertain those who publicly insult the PM. ""This list therefore needs some careful checking in this regard."" He went through it with a red pen, ticking ""those who I would personally like to see included"" and putting a question mark by ""those who I believe do NOT help"". He added that more than one tick ""means super person and a known friend and wonderful to have them here"". Top of his list was the comic and actor Eric Sykes, who got four ticks by his name. The golfer Peter Alliss got three -  Ronnie Corbett got two ticks, as did Penelope Keith, Judith Chalmers, Tim Rice and others. More than one tick meant a ""super person"", Denis Thatcher explained - but a question mark meant they ""do NOT help"" More intriguing are his question marks. The artists Gilbert and George, described as ""image makers"", got two. Single question marks went to Jan Leeming, Paul Daniels and Shirley Bassey, who'd been at the Wembley rally, Paul McCartney and, oddest of all, David Attenborough. Richard Ingrams, who for many years wrote the Dear Bill letters in Private Eye magazine, purporting to be the private correspondence of Denis Thatcher to a golfing friend, has his own theory about the ticks and crosses. ""One of the few things we know about Denis is that he had a very low opinion of the BBC. He thought that BBC people were all pinkos."" Writer and comedian Eric Sykes seems to have been Denis Thatcher's favourite choice That might explain why Sir David got a question mark - or perhaps Denis mixed up his Attenboroughs. David's brother, the actor and director Richard, was a longstanding Labour supporter. ""It's very unusual to have Denis interfering,"" Mr Ingrams adds. ""Denis loved his wife and wanted to protect her, and kept out of the limelight himself. He used to say a whale only gets shot if it spouts."" Chris Collins, director of the Margaret Thatcher Foundation and editor of its vast archive website, agrees it was ""unusual"" for Denis Thatcher to involve himself to this extent. The reason, he adds, may be an earlier episodein which Mrs Thatcher considered suing BBC Radio 4's Today programmefor libel over a satirical entry in a short-story competition, entitled Thatcherism: The Final Solution, which aired in January 1988. Mr Thatcher wrote a personal letter of complaint to the BBC's then chairman Marmaduke Hussey, saying that never had ""so foul a libel been published against anyone, let alone a prime minister"". A question mark was placed beside David Attenborough's name Mr Collins adds that: ""The special coded system of question marks and ticks and crosses, that's actually slightly unusual. ""Certainly the steam is coming out of his ears at various points in 1988 and this party he jumps on."" The final guest list included only the original 45 names, plus the 1988 British Winter Olympics team - and the parliamentary skiing team. Eddie ""the Eagle"" Edwards, whose efforts at that winter's Games had won him admirers around the world, wasn't there: he had a prior charity engagement. Richard Ingrams never met Denis Thatcher when he was writing Dear Bill, but he did later invite him to a lunch for the Oldie magazine, which Mr Ingrams founded and edited. After that, he came, as a paying punter, to literary lunches, always sending a handwritten ""thank you"" card. Richard Ingrams says it is unusual for Denis Thatcher to have interfered in a matter like this ""And so that's quite funny, that for this party he comes down hard on people who've written unfavourably about The Boss [Margaret Thatcher], that he chose to fraternise with me! Albeit once her political career was over."" And did they ever talk about the Dear Bill letters? ""No, he never mentioned them. But maybe he thought that was just being polite."" Could Philip May ever play the same role? Richard Ingrams thinks not. ""He's playing the Denis role of keeping his trap shut. We know very little about Philip May. But Mrs May doesn't really measure up to Thatcher."" Members of the public will be able to browse through the archive from Monday 23 July by visitingwww.margaretthatcher.org,external.

"Galle cricket stadium may be demolishedThe famously picturesque ground, in southern Sri Lanka, is next to a World Heritage-listed fort.Asia","England fans watch their team play Sri Lanka at Galle Stadium in 2012 One of the world's most picturesque cricket stadiums is at risk of being demolished because it threatens the heritage status of a nearby fort. Galle cricket stadium, in southern Sri Lanka, is famed for its stunning views of the Indian Ocean. But it is the 17th Century Dutch fort which looms over the ground that has put it in danger. Sri Lanka's cultural affairs minister Wijeyadasa Rakapakshe said the fort risks losing Unesco World Heritage status because of unauthorised construction nearby, including the 500-seat pavilion stand which was rebuilt after the ground was devastated by the 2004 tsunami. Sri Lanka have won most of the matches they have played here since 1998 Standing on the fort affords a good view of the cricket below England are due to play here in November, and may end up being the last team to do so The stadium was devastated by the 2004 Boxing Day tsunami, which killed at least 31,000 people in Sri Lanka It was rebuilt afterwards - but the new pavilion blocks the view of the fort from the city's main road Mr Rakapakshe said the government had been left with a choice: either remain on the World Heritage list, or keep the pavilion. However, Arjuna Ranatunga - who led Sri Lanka to victory in the 1996 World Cup as captain - has suggested a compromise: demolish the current stand, and put up temporary seating when Test matches were played.

The celebrities 'banned' from Thatcherâs party,"Files just released show how in 1988 Denis Thatcher personally vetted the guest list for a showbiz reception at Number 10, providing an insight into the thoughts of one of the most taciturn of prime ministerial consorts. On 7 June 1987, just days before the general election, the Conservatives held a rally in Wembley. On the stage with the prime minister were 45 celebrities, rounded up by the entrepreneur and Conservative fundraiser Sir Basil Feldman. They included some of the biggest names in TV at the time, including Ronnie Corbett, Jimmy Tarbuck, Bob Monkhouse and Shirley Bassey. Mrs Thatcher won, of course, and a few months later decided to give a party to thank her showbiz supporters. Forty-five guests would not fill up the grand reception rooms at Number 10 Downing Street, so the list,now revealed by the Thatcher Archive,external, was expanded. Although she appeared at the Wembley rally, a red question mark was placed against Shirley Bassey's name John Whittingdale, then Mrs Thatcher's political secretary, suggested Paul McCartney, Cliff Richard, Freddie Mercury and Mick Jagger as guests. The first two made the list, drawn up by the ministry for the arts: government ministers were added, as were civil list pensioners and sportsmen and women. Sir Denis Thatcher dies,external Margaret Thatcher: From grocerâs daughter to Iron Lady Obituary: Margaret Thatcher This guest list, which contained 229 names, not including spouses, was copied by Mrs Thatcher's private office to Denis Thatcher, who was to co-host the party. He wrote back: ""Whilst I accept of course that not everyone who comes to our receptions are necessarily on our side I find it both unpleasant and embarrassing to entertain those who publicly insult the PM. ""This list therefore needs some careful checking in this regard."" He went through it with a red pen, ticking ""those who I would personally like to see included"" and putting a question mark by ""those who I believe do NOT help"". He added that more than one tick ""means super person and a known friend and wonderful to have them here"". Top of his list was the comic and actor Eric Sykes, who got four ticks by his name. The golfer Peter Alliss got three -  Ronnie Corbett got two ticks, as did Penelope Keith, Judith Chalmers, Tim Rice and others. More than one tick meant a ""super person"", Denis Thatcher explained - but a question mark meant they ""do NOT help"" More intriguing are his question marks. The artists Gilbert and George, described as ""image makers"", got two. Single question marks went to Jan Leeming, Paul Daniels and Shirley Bassey, who'd been at the Wembley rally, Paul McCartney and, oddest of all, David Attenborough. Richard Ingrams, who for many years wrote the Dear Bill letters in Private Eye magazine, purporting to be the private correspondence of Denis Thatcher to a golfing friend, has his own theory about the ticks and crosses. ""One of the few things we know about Denis is that he had a very low opinion of the BBC. He thought that BBC people were all pinkos."" Writer and comedian Eric Sykes seems to have been Denis Thatcher's favourite choice That might explain why Sir David got a question mark - or perhaps Denis mixed up his Attenboroughs. David's brother, the actor and director Richard, was a longstanding Labour supporter. ""It's very unusual to have Denis interfering,"" Mr Ingrams adds. ""Denis loved his wife and wanted to protect her, and kept out of the limelight himself. He used to say a whale only gets shot if it spouts."" Chris Collins, director of the Margaret Thatcher Foundation and editor of its vast archive website, agrees it was ""unusual"" for Denis Thatcher to involve himself to this extent. The reason, he adds, may be an earlier episodein which Mrs Thatcher considered suing BBC Radio 4's Today programmefor libel over a satirical entry in a short-story competition, entitled Thatcherism: The Final Solution, which aired in January 1988. Mr Thatcher wrote a personal letter of complaint to the BBC's then chairman Marmaduke Hussey, saying that never had ""so foul a libel been published against anyone, let alone a prime minister"". A question mark was placed beside David Attenborough's name Mr Collins adds that: ""The special coded system of question marks and ticks and crosses, that's actually slightly unusual. ""Certainly the steam is coming out of his ears at various points in 1988 and this party he jumps on."" The final guest list included only the original 45 names, plus the 1988 British Winter Olympics team - and the parliamentary skiing team. Eddie ""the Eagle"" Edwards, whose efforts at that winter's Games had won him admirers around the world, wasn't there: he had a prior charity engagement. Richard Ingrams never met Denis Thatcher when he was writing Dear Bill, but he did later invite him to a lunch for the Oldie magazine, which Mr Ingrams founded and edited. After that, he came, as a paying punter, to literary lunches, always sending a handwritten ""thank you"" card. Richard Ingrams says it is unusual for Denis Thatcher to have interfered in a matter like this ""And so that's quite funny, that for this party he comes down hard on people who've written unfavourably about The Boss [Margaret Thatcher], that he chose to fraternise with me! Albeit once her political career was over."" And did they ever talk about the Dear Bill letters? ""No, he never mentioned them. But maybe he thought that was just being polite."" Could Philip May ever play the same role? Richard Ingrams thinks not. ""He's playing the Denis role of keeping his trap shut. We know very little about Philip May. But Mrs May doesn't really measure up to Thatcher."" Members of the public will be able to browse through the archive from Monday 23 July by visitingwww.margaretthatcher.org,external.

Newsreader's debut wearing hearing aid,"This video can not be played Lewis Vaughan Jones: ""It was crowded and loud on air"" A newsreader who suddenly lost the hearing in his left ear, has received messages of support after his first appearance on air with a hearing aid. Lewis Vaughan Jones, 37, feared his career presenting the news on the BBC and ITN was over after doctors told him the hearing loss was permanent. ""That was the darkest moment,"" he told BBC Radio 5 live. He also spoke of his embarrassment in social situations and the difficulties of coming to terms with a hearing aid. Vaughan Jones had good hearing all his life until he got a cold several months ago and couldn't hear in one ear. Doctors found his left eardrum was no longer working and the nerve which takes sound to the brain had given up, he told BBC Breakfast. When they told him the sudden hearing loss and the tinnitus were permanent,  he walked out of hospital ""completely bamboozled"", he added. Why you should get your hearing checked Video: 'I have a magnet in my head' The charity Action on Hearing Loss says about 11m people in the UK have some form of hearing loss, and 2m use hearing aids.  It estimates that there are about 6.7m people who could benefit from hearing aids. Before being fitted with a hearing aid, Vaughan Jones said his situation had left him frustrated and embarrassed. ""There's only so many times you can interrupt. You feel embarrassed so you withdraw,"" he said. He also described how he would smile and nod along when spending time with friends and family, feeling unable to engage and as though he was missing out. His hearing aid, he said, has been a massive help, allowing him to return to work. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

His return to screen, however, was a noisy one as he can hear the director and correspondents through an earpiece in his right ear and an amplified, distorted version of his own voice through the hearing aid in his left. The brain should learn to quieten down that distortion, he said. Getting used to wearing a hearing aid has not come easy. ""I was self-conscious about it. My hair is slightly longer so that's a reflection that I might have been trying to hide it,"" he adds. Now back on air, he wants to show everyone he is wearing one. ""There's no logical reason why I shouldn't wear my hearing aid on air and feel good about it,"" he said. Some took to Twitter to agree. Allow Twitter content?

Robbie M said he started wearing two hearing aids five years ago after finding he was unable to hear in meetings.

Guardians of the Galaxy director firedJames Gunn will not film the franchise's third instalment after offensive old tweets resurfaced.US & Canada,"James Gunn has worked on the Guardians of the Galaxy films and the Avengers franchise Disney has removed James Gunn as director of Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3 after a number of offensive social media posts resurfaced online. The American filmmaker apologised after old tweets in which he appeared to joke about paedophilia and rape were unearthed and widely shared. But Walt Disney Studios Chairman Alan Horn announced his sacking on Friday. ""The offensive attitudes and statements discovered on James' Twitter feed are indefensible,"" he said in a statement. ""[They are] inconsistent with our studio's values, and we have severed our business relationship with him."" Gunn wrote and directed both of the first two Guardians of the Galaxy films, which starred the likes of Chris Pratt, Zoe Saldana and Bradley Cooper. Off-screen heroes reveal Marvel magic Who could follow The Avengers' success? The first instalment was one of Marvel's most successful films, making more than $771m (Â£540m) at the worldwide box office. Gunn has also worked on the hugely-successful Avengers franchise. There has been no immediate response from the filmmaker, but in a series of tweets posted on Thursday he addressed the controversy surrounding his old posts. ""I viewed myself as a provocateur, making movies and telling jokes that were outrageous and taboo,"" he said. ""I am very, very different than I was a few years ago."" ""I have apologized for humor of mine that hurt people. I truly felt sorry and meant every word of my apologies,"" he added. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Earlier this month, he accused the US leader of ""treason"" over comments he made ata summit with his Russian counterpart Vladimir Putin. It is not clear who will replace him on Guardians of the Galaxy Vol. 3, which was reportedly set to be filmed next year. Off-screen heroes reveal Marvel magic.

Toblerone to revert to original shape,"The 150g Toblerone featured larger gaps between its distinctive triangles Makers of the Swiss chocolate bar, Toblerone, are to scrap its latest incarnation which saw wide gaps between its distinctive triangular chunks. That version was introduced in 2016 to reduce its weight but drew criticism, with some likening it to a bike rack. US-based Mondelez International said the new shape had not been a ""perfect long-term answer"" for its customers. Now it plans to increase the current size from 150g to 200g and revert to making it in its traditional shape. When the downsized version was first released, the makers blamed a rise in the cost of ingredients and said they had to make a decision between changing the look or raising the price. But the new widely-spaced triangles in the lighter bar left fans feeling cheated. OnToblerone's Facebook page,external, Louise Bennett wrote: ""After a busy day at work I decided to treat myself. I was super excited, until I opened it and discovered half of the pieces missing!"" And Scott Blackadder wrote: ""I was eating mine today and lost my shoe. I found it in one of the gaps in my Toblerone."" Prince George celebrates fifth birthday M1 breakdown driver 'had somewhere to be' The truth about our shrinking snacks Asked whether falling sales were behind the return to the original shape, Mondelez said sales of the 150g bar increased after the shape was changed and 2017 was a ""fantastic year"" for Toblerone. Manufacturing has now ceased on 150g bars, the firm added. It is unclear what the retail price will be of the new 200g bar, due to be on the shelves later this year. Toblerones also come in 100g bars, which retail at Â£1.63, and in 360g bars for Â£5.49. On Friday, Mondelez, which owns Cadbury, saidDairy Milk bars containing 30% less sugarwould go on sale from next year after the government challenged the food industry to cut sugar levels.

Facebook investigates another data firm,"Facebook said it had found no evidence data was improperly obtained - but would suspend Crimson Hexagon while it investigated Facebook has suspended a US-based analytics firm while it investigates concerns about the collection and sharing of user data. Crimson Hexagon, based in Boston, describes itself as offering âconsumer insightsâ and has contracts with government agencies around the world. Facebook said it was looking into whether some of these deals were in violation of its policies on surveillance. The network said it had not found any evidence so far that data had been improperly obtained. According to the Wall Street Journal,external, Crimson Hexagon has ""contracts to analyse public Facebook data for clients including a Russian nonprofit with ties to the Kremlin and multiple US government agenciesâ. In March 2017, Facebook prohibited user data being used for government surveillance following pressure from civil liberties groups concerned about the targeting of dissidents and protesters. ""We don't allow developers to build surveillance tools using information from Facebook or Instagram,â a Facebook spokesman said in a statement on Friday. ""We take these allegations seriously, and we have suspended these apps while we investigate.â Crimson Hexagon works with a data set that includes, according to its own website, more than one trillion social media posts take from Facebook, Instagram, Twitter and others. It boasts of being able to analyse more than 160m photographs posted online every day. As well as government work, Crimson Hexagon has had deals with commercial companies including Adidas, Samsung and the BBC. Gathering and sharing âdata insightsâ with businesses is not against Facebookâs policies. ""People can share their information with developers on Facebook and Instagram - just as they can when they download an app on their phone,â said Ime Archibong, Facebookâs head of partnerships. He said developers were allowed to ""use public or aggregated information to produce anonymised insights for business purposeâ. Where Crimson Hexagon would fall foul of Facebookâs rules is if the data was used to create tools for surveillance, though Facebook has never clarified how its policy works in practice. Crimson Hexagon did not respond to requests for comment from the BBC.In a blog entry posted by the firm on Friday,external, its chief technology officer Chris Bingham defended the companyâs work - without specifically mentioning Facebookâs investigation. ""Crimson Hexagon only collects publicly available social media data that anyone can access,â he wrote, seeking to distance his firm from Cambridge Analytica, the firm which allegedly used an app to scrape private data from the network. Mr Bingham added: ""The real conversation is not about a particular social media analytics provider, or even a particular social network like Facebook. It is about the broader role and use of public online data in the modern world.â A spokesman for Facebook told the BBC the firm had already spoken with Crimson Hexagon, and the firms are due to meet in the coming days. ________ Follow Dave Lee onTwitter @DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

Mourners wear pink for Alesha farewell,"This video can not be played Mourners wore pink in Alesha's memory Hundreds of mourners have attended the funeral of a six-year-old girl who was killed while on holiday on a Scottish island. Mourners were asked to wear pink to remember Alesha MacPhail, who was found dead after disappearing from her grandmother's home on the Isle of Bute on 2 July. A 16-year-old boy has been charged with her rape and murder. In one of the tributes her uncle described her as ""the brightest thing"". Dozens of bows were tied to the railings of the building while cuddly toys including teddies and unicorns lined the wall outside Coats funeral home in Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire. Six-year-old Alesha MacPhail was laid to rest in North Lanarkshire During the service mourners heard tributes from people close to Alesha including an emotional speech from her uncle Calum MacPhail. He said: ""Alesha would rather hurt than you, she had a great amount of love for absolutely everyone. ""Alesha is everything that I wanted to be, she was kind, caring, smart, I just cannot believe she is gone. ""She was the brightest thing."" Alesha's mother wrote a message which read: ""I love you more than this world"" He was comforted by Alesha's mother Georgina Lochrane, known as Genie, who went up to hug him as he returned to his seat near the schoolgirl's father Robert MacPhail, her younger sister and other family members. Hundreds of people later lined the streets as the funeral cortege travelled to Coltswood Cemetery, where she was laid to rest. Emma Gibson, Alesha's class teacher at Chapelside Primary School in nearby Airdrie, also spoke at the service. She said: ""Alesha was a bright and bubbly little girl, she always came into class with that big beautiful smile of hers. ""It was an absolute pleasure to have taught Alesha. I'm so grateful to have known this special little girl."" Head teacher Wendy Davie said: ""May your smile shine brightly wherever you are, you will always be remembered as our Chapelside star."" Robert MacPhail's girlfriend Toni McLachlan also gave a tribute, saying: ""Sleep tight, little angel."" Alesha, who was from Airdrie, had been staying at her grandmother's house on Bute when she was reported missing. She was a few days into a three-week summer break on the island in the Firth of Clyde, west of Glasgow. Floral tributes were laid for Alesha's funeral in Coatbridge The service was led by funeral director Fraser MacGregor, who said Alesha was an amazing and talented little girl and the ""best big sister, best daughter, best granddaughter and friend that anyone could have asked for"". He said that Alesha will always be remembered as a ""very loving girl, friendly, good natured and full of love"" who enjoyed everything from doing gymnastics and riding her bike to baking cakes, listening to music and watching Peppa Pig. Mr MacGregor also said that Alesha was fascinated by bubbles and had always wanted a bubble party on her birthday. As music played at the end of the service a bubble machine sent bubbles drifting above the mourners' heads. A candlelit vigil for Alesha was held in Rothesay on Bute earlier this month and an online fundraiser set up to support relatives reached almost Â£13,000.

Death row inmate spared after abuse revelations,"John Kasich has granted clemency to a killer sentenced to die A US governor has spared a convicted killer sentenced to die after a juror said that his childhood abuse had not been properly detailed at trial. Ohio Governor John Kasich commuted Raymond Tibbetts' sentence to life in jail due to ""fundamental flaws"" in his sentencing. Juror Ross Geiger found evidence of Tibbetts' traumatic past that jurors never heard, he told parole officials. Tibbetts, 61, was convicted of killing his wife and a 67-year-old man in 1997. The governor overturned an Ohio Parole Board ruling and granted clemency to Tibbetts, who will now serve life in jail without parole. Gov Kasich said in a statement on Friday: ""The defence's failure to present sufficient mitigating evidence, coupled with an inaccurate description of Tibbetts' childhood by the prosecution, essentially prevented the jury from making an informed decision about whether Tibbetts deserved the death sentence."" The woman who watched 300 executions How US death penalty capital changed its mind Raymond Tibbetts is convicted of killing two people Gov Kasich had delayed Tibbetts' execution in February after receivinga letter from Mr Geiger,externalasking for clemency. Tibbetts' attorney, Erin Barnhart, said, ""Governor Kasich has done our State a great service today by rectifying this wrong and ensuring that the checks and balances in our criminal justice system can work,""WCPO reported,external. In Cincinnati 21 years ago, Tibbetts killed Fred Hicks, a man who had hired Tibbetts' wife as a caretaker and who allowed them to live in his house. The same day, he fatally beat and stabbed his wife, Judith Crawford, 42, after she argued with him about his cocaine addiction. A US lethal injection execution chamber Tibbetts received the death penalty for murdering Hicks, and life imprisonment for the slaying of Crawford. While Tibbetts' guilt remains unquestioned, Mr Geiger wrote to Gov Kasich when he discovered details of Tibbett's childhood abuse that had not been presented in trial. Growing up, Tibbetts and his brothers had faced horrific conditions in the foster care system. Tibbetts' application for mercy last year stated that he and his brothers were tied to a bed at night, starved, beaten, burned and thrown down stairs,CBS News reported,external. This video can not be played The US executioner who wants the death penalty abolished In an opinion piece for news siteCleveland.com,externalearlier this year, Mr Geiger called on Gov Kasich to ""correct the system's mistake"". ""The system failed to provide me with the information I needed to make an accurate and fair determination,"" he wrote. He said if ""prosecutors had been honest and forthcoming about the horrors"" Tibbetts experienced as a child, he ""would have voted for life without parole over death"". In accordance with Ohio law, even if only Mr Geiger voted for parole over death, he wrote, Tibbetts' would have been spared death row. Mr Geiger testified before the Ohio Parole Board, asking for clemency since the jury had not known the facts of Tibbetts' upbringing and severe addictions to drugs and alcohol. The board had voted against his request, siding with prosecutors who argued that Tibbetts' past did not outweigh his crimes, US media reported. Prosecutor Joe Deters on Friday maintained that position, telling WCPO in a statement that the governor ""has ever right to do what he did. We do not have to agree with it but he is the governor and it is over"".

A 16-year-old boy has been charged with her rape and murder. In one of the tributes her uncle described her as ""the brightest thing"". Dozens of bows were tied to the railings of the building while cuddly toys including teddies and unicorns lined the wall outside Coats funeral home in Coatbridge, North Lanarkshire. Six-year-old Alesha MacPhail was laid to rest in North Lanarkshire During the service mourners heard tributes from people close to Alesha including an emotional speech from her uncle Calum MacPhail. He said: ""Alesha would rather hurt than you, she had a great amount of love for absolutely everyone. ""Alesha is everything that I wanted to be, she was kind, caring, smart, I just cannot believe she is gone. ""She was the brightest thing."" Alesha's mother wrote a message which read: ""I love you more than this world"" He was comforted by Alesha's mother Georgina Lochrane, known as Genie, who went up to hug him as he returned to his seat near the schoolgirl's father Robert MacPhail, her younger sister and other family members. Hundreds of people later lined the streets as the funeral cortege travelled to Coltswood Cemetery, where she was laid to rest. Emma Gibson, Alesha's class teacher at Chapelside Primary School in nearby Airdrie, also spoke at the service. She said: ""Alesha was a bright and bubbly little girl, she always came into class with that big beautiful smile of hers. ""It was an absolute pleasure to have taught Alesha. I'm so grateful to have known this special little girl."" Head teacher Wendy Davie said: ""May your smile shine brightly wherever you are, you will always be remembered as our Chapelside star."" Robert MacPhail's girlfriend Toni McLachlan also gave a tribute, saying: ""Sleep tight, little angel."" Alesha, who was from Airdrie, had been staying at her grandmother's house on Bute when she was reported missing. She was a few days into a three-week summer break on the island in the Firth of Clyde, west of Glasgow. Floral tributes were laid for Alesha's funeral in Coatbridge The service was led by funeral director Fraser MacGregor, who said Alesha was an amazing and talented little girl and the ""best big sister, best daughter, best granddaughter and friend that anyone could have asked for"". He said that Alesha will always be remembered as a ""very loving girl, friendly, good natured and full of love"" who enjoyed everything from doing gymnastics and riding her bike to baking cakes, listening to music and watching Peppa Pig. Mr MacGregor also said that Alesha was fascinated by bubbles and had always wanted a bubble party on her birthday. As music played at the end of the service a bubble machine sent bubbles drifting above the mourners' heads. A candlelit vigil for Alesha was held in Rothesay on Bute earlier this month and an online fundraiser set up to support relatives reached almost Â£13,000.
