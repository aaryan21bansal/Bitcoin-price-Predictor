John Lewis ends 'Never Knowingly Undersold' pledge,"Department store chain John Lewis has said it will drop its ""Never Knowingly Undersold"" price pledge this summer. The price promise, which began in 1925, means the retailer matches prices on branded products with national retailers, but not online-only sales. John Lewis said the pledge was becoming less relevant as shopping moves increasingly online. Instead, the employee-owned retailer says it will spend Â£500m on keeping prices down. ""Never Knowingly Undersold has been a cherished sign of trust for John Lewis for a century but it doesn't fit with how customers shop today as more purchases are made online,"" said executive director Pippa Wicks. John Lewis says it expects shoppers to become more cost conscious as budgets are squeezed by the higher cost of living. Prices are currently rising faster than at any time in the past 30 years and wages are failing to keep up, meaning people's money is not going as far. The Bank of England expects the rate of inflation to pick up in April when a big rise in household energy bills takes effect. The John Lewis department store business is part of the John Lewis Partnership which also owns the Waitrose supermarket chain. The partnership is due to report full year results on 10 March after the pandemic drove it to a Â£517m loss in 2020-2021. But half-year results published in September showed a return to profit. John Lewis said it would give customers an exact date for when Never Knowingly Undersold ends nearer the time.

Russian GP off after Ukraine invasion,"The Russian Grand Prix is closely associated with President Vladimir Putin The Russian Formula 1 Grand Prix has been cancelled as a result of the invasion of Ukraine. An F1 statement said it had been agreed at a meeting of stakeholders ""that it is impossible to hold the Russian Grand Prix in the current circumstances"". It added that F1 was watching the ongoing situation in Ukraine ""with sadness and shock and hopes for a swift and peaceful resolution"". The Russian Grand Prix was due to take place on 25 September in Sochi. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Meanwhile, Haas team boss Gunther Steiner has said the future of his driver Nikita Mazepin ""needs to resolved"". Steiner said the team had ""legal issues to go through"" in an apparent hint the US-based outfit are trying to split from Mazepin and the sponsorship money that comes from his father Dmitry - a billionaire with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Haas had already removed the logos advertising Mazepin's company beforeFriday's final day of this week's pre-season test in Barcelona. Steiner said the team would work on the situation next week, but insisted the future of Haas in F1 was not in doubt. For the latest from Ukraine, follow live updates from BBC News European clubs, players and fans show support for Ukraine Champions League final moved from Russia to Paris & what else is happening in sport? This video can not be played I would not go to Russia GP - Vettel, speaking before cancellation The Russian Grand Prix is closely associated with Putin, who was instrumental in it being established in 2014 in the Black Sea resort town of Sochi, where he has a palace. The event is due to move to a purpose-built facility outside St Petersburg, Putin's hometown, from 2023, but the event's future in F1 must now be in serious doubt. On Thursday, four-time championSebastian Vettel said he would not race in Russia if the race went ahead. The German said: ""I should not go, I will not go. It is wrong to race in the country. ""I am sorry for the innocent people who are being killed for stupid reasons and a very strange and mad leadership."" His thoughts were echoed by world champion Max Verstappen, who said: ""When a country is at war it is not right to race there."" Pierre Gasly (Alpha Tauri):""I am really pleased this decision was made. It is completely the right one, knowing they are in war. It's really sad to see what's happening. ""We know how powerful Russia is. It's an unfair fight and I am just very sorry and feeling very sad for all these families out there. I am also personally affected, having some people close to me in Ukraine. ""It's a very difficult situation and very scary because they don't know if they are going to be able to make it out and see their relatives. I don't see us going to Russia with the decisions they have taken lately. We are not the only sport to make such a statement and take these decisions."" Lando Norris (McLaren):""This is a very good decision from Formula 1. Russia is not a place I would want to be going right now and I'm very sad to see what's going on and the innocent lives that are being taken. ""There is no reason we should live our lives normally and go and have a normal race in that country when those things are going on. I definitely wouldn't want to go."" Alexander Albon (Williams):""I think it's the right step. It's really saddening. There are much bigger things out there than racing."" Carlos Sainz (Ferrari):""I would have found it very difficult to catch a plane and land in a country that is at war, so I am happy everything has been cancelled for the moment and now we can just hope and pray that everything is going to be solved soon."" Lance Stroll (Aston Martin):""It's terrible what is going on in the world right now. For innocent people just lose their lives, you have to put everything in perspective. ""It's very scary times and we definitely have to pray and hope things will be OK. But it is very hard to watch. F1 has made the right decision. We can't be going to Russia right now."" Mazepin was among the drivers on track during Friday's morning testing session in Barcelona Haas are owned by the US billionaire Gene Haas, who welcomed Mazepin's money before last season to reduce his own investment in the team. Mazepin has been an underwhelming performer, and Putin's decision looks likely to end his F1 career. Asked about the Mazepins' involvement, Steiner said: ""It needs to be resolved. There are governments involved and I have no power over them and we need to see how the situation develops in Ukraine."" And referencing the decision to remove the stickers advertising Mazepin's father's company and the colour scheme on the car, which echoed the Russian flag, Steiner said: ""We made a decision yesterday with our team partners. ""I need to work on the rest next week. There is no setback for the competition side of the team, none at all. We just have to go through the commercial issues. ""The team are not affected by this. I told them there is nothing to worry about. We took the right decision to send a message to everyone.""

UK intelligence fears âbloody and brutalâ Ukraine war,"Members of the Territorial Defence Forces of Ukraine receive weapons Cabinet ministers received what one source described as an ""ominous assessment"" from defence and intelligence chiefs on Thursday night about what may lie ahead for the people of Ukraine. And it has now become clearer what the fears of the Western allies are. Ukrainian resistance to Russian President Vladimir Putin's forces is - for the people of the country - something of a double-edged sword. Intelligence assessments suggest Russian forces are making slower progress than they had envisaged. A well-placed Western official suggested Ukrainian forces had traded control of ""empty spaces"" and ""rural areas"" to concentrate on defending the cities. There are now significant concerns Mr Putin will look to effect his aim of regime change in the capital Kyiv ""by any means necessary"", that source said. That could mean the indiscriminate use of violence and the indiscriminate use of artillery - with the civilian population very much in the firing line.

The hope is the cost of deploying troops and material in Ukraine, and the economic damage of sanctions, might force a change of strategy or indeed leadership. But a protracted period of conflict and sanctions is envisaged. Those who look for a glimmer of hope amid this grim landscape would argue Mr Putin is at risk of getting the opposite of what he wants - Nato reinforcing its eastern borders, greater isolation, and a more unified Ukrainian population. They point, too, to the bravery of those Russians who have protested against the invasion. But some Conservative as well as opposition MPs are urging more weaponry of all kinds - from flak jacket body armour and sat-phones to anti-aircraft missiles - to be sent to Ukraine and quickly.

Who is not on the UK sanctions list?,"President Putin's spokesman was sanctioned by the EU weeks before the UK The UK has added hundreds of people to its sanctions list, following Russia's invasion of Ukraine. The passage of the Economic Crime Act has made it easier for the government to take action against people already sanctioned by the US, the EU, Canada or Australia. The government has published the names of more than 750 individuals and companies it has sanctioned since the invasion. Some of them appeared on a list of 35 people who Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny suggested should be sanctioned. There has been criticism of the amount of time it has taken the UK to impose sanctions on some of the individuals. For example Oleg Deripaska, an industrialist with close ties to President Putin, has beensanctioned in the US,externalsince April 2018, but was only sanctioned in the UK on 10 March 2022. He has not been sanctioned by the EU. The US Treasury said he had been ""investigated for money laundering, and has been accused of threatening the lives of business rivals, illegally wiretapping a government official, and taking part in extortion and racketeering.  There are also allegations that Deripaska bribed a government official, ordered the murder of a businessman, and had links to a Russian organized crime group."" Mr Deripaska (left) pictured with President Putin in 2014 Andrey Kostin, president of the Russian state-owned VTB bank, has also been sanctioned in the US since April 2018 and was sanctioned by the EU on 23 February 2022. He was added to the UK list on 10 March. President Putin's spokesman Dmitry Peskov and his chief of staff Anton Vaino were both sanctioned by the EU on 28 February but not by the UK until 15 March. Russian Prime Minister Mikhail Mishustin wasadded to the EU list,externalon 25 February but not sanctioned in the UK until 15 March. Since the invasion on 24 February, the EU has sanctioned 424 individuals who have not been sanctioned by the UK. The US has sanctioned 38 individuals who are not on the UK's list. There are still four individuals named by Mr Navalny who appear on the EU or the US sanctions list but not on the UK's. Alexander Kalashnikov, added by the EU to their list of human rights violators, was sacked as director of Russia's Federal Penitentiary Service in 2021, after a scandal concerning the widespread practice of torture in Russian prisons. He is also sanctioned by the US. Victor Zolotov, on the US and EU lists but not on the UK's, leads Russia'sNational Guard. His family is one of the richest in Russia in the real estate sector. On 23 February,the EU added,externaltwo people not sanctioned in the UK to its sanctions list: Vladimir Soloviev, a Russian television presenter Margarita Simonyan, editor-in-chief of the Russia Today television news network There are four individuals on the list who have been sanctioned in the UK but not in the US or the EU. All of them were sanctioned on 15 March and had already been sanctioned by Canada: Konstantin Ernst a television producer and Putin ally Alexander Beglov, governor of St Petersburg Yuri Chaika, Russia's former prosecutor general who has also been sanctioned by Australia Sergei Sobyanin, mayor of Moscow. Roman Abramovich, the Russian billionaire former owner of Chelsea FC who was sanctioned by the UK government on 10 March because of his links to Russian President Vladimir Putin, was not sanctioned by the EUuntil 15 March,external. There have also been questions in parliament about why action has not been taken against some Russian companies. Gazprom is one of the world's biggest natural gas companies and is partly state-owned. The US has sanctions against Gazprom but the UK does not. The same is true of Rosneft, the Russian oil company, which is 40% owned by the Russian state, and 20% owned by British oil giant BP. But the UK has imposed sanctions on Igor Sechin, chief executive of Rosneft, who was sanctioned by the US in April 2014. It has also sanctioned Alexei Miller, chief executive of Gazprom, who the US sanctioned in April 2018. BP to offload stake in Rosneft amid Ukraine conflict Shell to sell Russian investments due to Ukraine conflict What sanctions are being imposed on Russia over Ukraine invasion? On 8 March,the government announced,externalit would be phasing out imports of Russian oil by the end of 2022. The UK has also imposed a ban on exporting luxury goods to Russia and will put a 35% tax on some imports from Russia, including vodka. At the start of the invasion, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the government has ""a hit list of oligarchs and Duma members"", but the cases against them needed ""to be legally watertight so that when we hit them, the hit sticks"". Dr Anna Bradshaw, a partner at Peters & Peters Solicitors, an expert on law relating to financial crime and economic sanctions, says individuals and companies have no legal means to prevent the government from adopting sanctions against them. She says that once sanctions are adopted any challenge is first reviewed by a government minister. If the government refuses to overturn the sanction, the individual can then take the matter to court. But the sanctioned individual can only pay their lawyers or any court fees with alicence from the Treasury,external. Even if a licence was granted the sanctioned individual might still find that there was no bank prepared to carry out the transaction. Nigel Kushner, from W Legal Ltd, who advises people targeted by sanctions, says legal challenges ""should be very carefully thought out because they may backfire"", because unless there was no basis whatsoever for the sanctions, a successful challenge might just lead to the ""person being designated again but this time with mountains of appropriate evidence in support"". It is also possible that if the government lost in the courts it could pass legislation to allow the sanctions to continue. Legal expert Prof Kern Alexander says it is ""sensible"" for the foreign secretary to review the cases against certain Russian oligarchs because UK human rights and other laws guarantee the rights of individuals and companies. The government has to give the individuals and companies prior notice that the sanctions will be imposed, and they have to be given the opportunity to be consulted, and to contest, the proposal.  It also needs evidence to show how the sanctions relate to the policy of stopping the Russian invasion of Ukraine. Prof Alexander says the individuals can argue that ""they do not have any influence with President Putin (or even that they do not know him) and that their wealth does not relate or support the Russian army or war machine and that imposing sanctions on them will not contribute to stopping or inhibiting Russian's invasion of Ukraine"". There have been examples of sanctions being overturned in the courts. One of them wasa 2010 case,externalin which the Supreme Court ruled that the government had overstepped its powers by freezing the assets of five people suspected of involvement with terrorism. In response to the ruling, the governmentquickly passed legislation,externalthat meant they did have the power to impose the sanctions.

What is Swift and why are leaders divided on sanctions?,"The European Commission has proposed excluding three more Russian banks from Swift, an international payment system used by thousands of financial institutions. It comes after the EU and its allies suspended seven institutions from the system in March. The move aims to hit the country's banking network and its access to funds via Swift, which is pivotal for the smooth transaction of money worldwide. Swift is the global financial artery that allows the smooth and rapid transfer of money across borders. It stands for Society for Worldwide Interbank Financial Telecommunication. Created in 1973 and based in Belgium, Swift links 11,000 banks and institutions in more than 200 countries. But Swift is not your traditional High Street bank. It is a sort of instant messaging system that informs users when payments have been sent and arrived. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? It sends more than 40 million messages a day, as trillions of dollars change hands between companies and governments. More than 1% of those messages were thought to involve Russian payments. In March, seven Russian banks were removed from Swift including Bank Otkritie, Novikombank, Promsvyazbank, Bank Rossiya, Sovcombank, Vnesheconombank (VEB) and VTB Bank. The European Commission now wants to exclude a further three including the country's biggest lender, Sberbank, which accounts for more than a third of Russia's banking sector. The package still has to be approved by EU ambassadors and is set to be signed off in the next few days. The EU, US, UK and others have said that cutting banks out of Swift will ensure they ""are disconnected from the international financial system and harm their ability to operate globally"". The aim is for Russian companies to lose access to the normal smooth and instant transactions provided by Swift, disrupting payments for its valuable energy and agricultural exports. Banks now have to deal directly with one another, adding delays and extra costs, and ultimately cutting off revenues for the Russian government. Russia was threatened with a Swift expulsion before - in 2014 when it annexed Crimea. Russia said the move would be tantamount to a declaration of war. Western allies did not go ahead, but the threat did prompt Russia to develop its own, very fledgling, cross-border transfer system called the System for Transfer of Financial Messages (SPFS) as an alternative to Swift. Few foreign countries currently use SPFS, but India is reportedly considering a Russian proposal to use it for payments in roubles. Separately, Moscow is working with Beijing to connect to China's Cross-Border Interbank Payment System (CIPS) - another alternative to Swift which processes payments in Chinese yuan. Some nations - such as Germany, France and Italy - were initially reluctant to take action against Russia's use of Swift. There were concerns that companies owed money by Russia would have to find alternative ways to get paid. There were also fears it could impact the global banking system, although there is no evidence of this yet. Alexei Kudrin, Russia's former finance minister, has suggested being cut off from Swift could shrink Russia's economy by 5%. However, there are doubts about the lasting impact on Russia's economy, particularly if banks find sustainable ways to reroute payments via countries that have not imposed sanctions. Swift was created by American and European banks, which did not want a single institution developing their own system and having a monopoly. The network is now jointly-owned by more than 2,000 banks and financial institutions. It is overseen by the National Bank of Belgium, in partnership with major central banks around the world - including the US Federal Reserve and the Bank of England. Swift helps make secure international trade possible for its members, and is not supposed to take sides in disputes. However, Iran was banned from Swift in 2012, as part of sanctions over its nuclear programme. It lost almost half of its oil export revenues and 30% of foreign trade. Swift says it has no influence over sanctions and any decision to impose them rests with governments.

Simple visual guide to what's happening in Ukraine,"Russian forces have launched a full-scale invasion of neighbouring Ukraine, attacking locations across the country. A number of people have been killed and thousands have fled their homes. These maps and images help to explain what we know about what has happened so far. Ukraine is in Eastern Europe and shares a border with Russia. It used to be part of the Soviet Union but became an independent country in 1991. Russian President Vladimir Putin sees Ukraine as historically part of Russia. In 2014, Russia invaded Crimea, in the south of Ukraine, and continues to occupy it. Russian forces crossed Ukraine's borders early on Thursday morning and began bombing military targets near big cities. Air strikes continued overnight and into the early hours of Friday, with attacks being reported across the country - including on the capital Kyiv. Russians tanks were filmed on the outskirts of Kyiv on Friday morning. A second night of attacks followed with heavy gunfire and explosions in parts of the capital. A number of civilian areas have been targeted, including one apartment complex outside of Kharkiv - a city of 1.4 million people in north-eastern Ukraine. Injured people - including a woman with bandages on her head - were seen after the air strikes. An apartment building in Kyiv washit by a missileon Saturday morning. Since 2014, Russian-backed separatists and Ukraine's armed forces have been fighting a war in the eastern regions of Donetsk and Luhansk in which more than 14,000 people have died. President Putin this month recognised the two regions held by the Russian-backed separatists as independent states and ordered Russian troops there, tearing up a peace deal. Ukraine says more than 100 people have been killed so far, including civilians. Many are now trying to escape the country, with UN estimates suggesting over 100,000 people have already fled from their homes. Streams of cars have been seen leaving major cities and are queuing to cross borders into neighbouring countries. Some in Kyiv are hunkering down in the city's metro stations and air raid shelters,while others are trying to escape. Lithuania, Latvia, Poland, Hungary, Slovakia and Romania and Moldova have all said they expect a wave of refugees from Ukraine. November 2021 Satellite imagery suggests Russia is sending troops towards its border with Ukraine. Russia denies it is preparing for an invasion and accuses Nato of upping its activity in the region. December 2021 Russia says the crisis can only be solved if the West agrees to a list of demands, including a guarantee that Ukraine will never join Nato. 17 January 2022 Russian troops begin arriving in Belarus for joint military exercises. Belarusian leader Alexander Lukashenko plays down their significance, saying they are “normal exercises”. 24 January Nato says its forces are on standby and more ships and fighter jets are being sent to the region. Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg says Nato will “continue to take all necessary measures to protect and defend all allies”. 26 January The US responds to Russiaâs list of demands, refusing to rule out Ukraine joining Nato in the future. In response, President Putin accuses the West of ignoring Russiaâs concerns. 15 February Russia says some of its troops are being withdrawn from areas near the Ukraine border - but Nato says it can see no evidence of a withdrawal. 22 February President Putin recognises the independence of the two Russian-backed separatists areas in eastern Ukraine and says troops will be sent to support them. 24 February Mr Putin announces a “special military operation"" by Russian troops is underway in Ukraine. Ukraine says it is a ""full-scale invasion”. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson has said the UK""cannot and will not just look away""at Russia's ""hideous and barbaric"" attack on Ukraine. He said the UK and its allies will launch a ""massive package"" of sanctions - commercial and financial penalties - to ""hobble"" Russia's economy. He also tried to reassure the British public by promising to do ""everything to keep our country safe"" and work with allies ""for however long it takes"" to restore Ukraine's independence. As a result of the conflict, oil prices have surged past $100 (Â£75) a barrel to hit their highest level for more than seven years, which will impact already-rising petrol prices in the UK. Events in Ukraine have also seenglobal share prices fall and the price of gold rise- as investors worry about the possible impact of the conflict.

Russian Grand Prix off after Ukraine invasion,"The Russian Grand Prix is closely associated with President Vladimir Putin The Russian Formula 1 Grand Prix has been cancelled as a result of the invasion of Ukraine. An F1 statement said it had been agreed at a meeting of stakeholders ""that it is impossible to hold the Russian Grand Prix in the current circumstances"". It added that F1 was watching the ongoing situation in Ukraine ""with sadness and shock and hopes for a swift and peaceful resolution"". The Russian Grand Prix was due to take place on 25 September in Sochi. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Meanwhile, Haas team boss Gunther Steiner has said the future of his driver Nikita Mazepin ""needs to resolved"". Steiner said the team had ""legal issues to go through"" in an apparent hint the US-based outfit are trying to split from Mazepin and the sponsorship money that comes from his father Dmitry - a billionaire with close ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Haas had already removed the logos advertising Mazepin's company beforeFriday's final day of this week's pre-season test in Barcelona. Steiner said the team would work on the situation next week, but insisted the future of Haas in F1 was not in doubt. For the latest from Ukraine, follow live updates from BBC News European clubs, players and fans show support for Ukraine Champions League final moved from Russia to Paris & what else is happening in sport? This video can not be played I would not go to Russia GP - Vettel, speaking before cancellation The Russian Grand Prix is closely associated with Putin, who was instrumental in it being established in 2014 in the Black Sea resort town of Sochi, where he has a palace. The event is due to move to a purpose-built facility outside St Petersburg, Putin's hometown, from 2023, but the event's future in F1 must now be in serious doubt. On Thursday, four-time championSebastian Vettel said he would not race in Russia if the race went ahead. The German said: ""I should not go, I will not go. It is wrong to race in the country. ""I am sorry for the innocent people who are being killed for stupid reasons and a very strange and mad leadership."" His thoughts were echoed by world champion Max Verstappen, who said: ""When a country is at war it is not right to race there."" Pierre Gasly (Alpha Tauri):""I am really pleased this decision was made. It is completely the right one, knowing they are in war. It's really sad to see what's happening. ""We know how powerful Russia is. It's an unfair fight and I am just very sorry and feeling very sad for all these families out there. I am also personally affected, having some people close to me in Ukraine. ""It's a very difficult situation and very scary because they don't know if they are going to be able to make it out and see their relatives. I don't see us going to Russia with the decisions they have taken lately. We are not the only sport to make such a statement and take these decisions."" Lando Norris (McLaren):""This is a very good decision from Formula 1. Russia is not a place I would want to be going right now and I'm very sad to see what's going on and the innocent lives that are being taken. ""There is no reason we should live our lives normally and go and have a normal race in that country when those things are going on. I definitely wouldn't want to go."" Alexander Albon (Williams):""I think it's the right step. It's really saddening. There are much bigger things out there than racing."" Carlos Sainz (Ferrari):""I would have found it very difficult to catch a plane and land in a country that is at war, so I am happy everything has been cancelled for the moment and now we can just hope and pray that everything is going to be solved soon."" Lance Stroll (Aston Martin):""It's terrible what is going on in the world right now. For innocent people just lose their lives, you have to put everything in perspective. ""It's very scary times and we definitely have to pray and hope things will be OK. But it is very hard to watch. F1 has made the right decision. We can't be going to Russia right now."" Mazepin was among the drivers on track during Friday's morning testing session in Barcelona Haas are owned by the US billionaire Gene Haas, who welcomed Mazepin's money before last season to reduce his own investment in the team. Mazepin has been an underwhelming performer, and Putin's decision looks likely to end his F1 career. Asked about the Mazepins' involvement, Steiner said: ""It needs to be resolved. There are governments involved and I have no power over them and we need to see how the situation develops in Ukraine."" And referencing the decision to remove the stickers advertising Mazepin's father's company and the colour scheme on the car, which echoed the Russian flag, Steiner said: ""We made a decision yesterday with our team partners. ""I need to work on the rest next week. There is no setback for the competition side of the team, none at all. We just have to go through the commercial issues. ""The team are not affected by this. I told them there is nothing to worry about. We took the right decision to send a message to everyone.""

"Stock markets rebound on Russia sanctionsOil prices fall back and shares across the UK, Europe and Asia rise as concerns ease over sanctions.BusinessComments","Soldiers examine the remains of a missile near Kyiv Global markets soared on Friday as investor concerns eased about the severity of sanctions imposed on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. Coordinated Western sanctions against Russia have targeted its banks but left its energy sector largely untouched. After sharp falls on Thursday, stock markets in the UK and Europe jumped more than 3%. US exchanges also rose. Oil prices reversed early gains on Friday and fell by more than 2% but are still trading near seven-year highs. Brent crude - the international benchmark for oil prices - dropped below $98 a barrel. The share price gains followed weeks of declines, fuelled in part by concerns about Europe's most severe conflict since World War Two. While the sanctions against Russia include freezing bank assets and cutting off state-owned enterprises, they stopped short of disconnecting Russia from the Swift international banking system or targeting its oil and gas exports, which some analysts said had helped stock markets start to recover. ""It's not that the market is saying the war is good news. They were worried about the war and selling off, and now it's happened and paradoxically it's not as bad as the worst case scenario, at least not yet,"" said Jonas Golterman, senior markets economist at Capital Economics. The UK'sFTSE 100 indexrose 3.9%- the biggest daily gain since November 2020 when Pfizer announced a vaccine breakthrough - and stock markets in Germany and France closed more than 3.5% higher. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 2.5% higher, while the S&P 500 rose 2.2% and the Nasdaq climbed 1.6%, extending gains from Thursday. Markets in Asia also closed higher. Why Ukraine crisis could cause global price rises What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? The gains came despite fighting across Ukraine on Friday forced tens of thousands of people from their homes. The US, UK and EU said Friday they would place sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin, but China's foreign ministry also reported that Mr Putin might be willing to hold talks with Ukraine. ""This is a very sentiment driven market right now, so if there is even a whisper that there might be willingness to talk, the market will rally and rally hard,"" said Ross Mayfield, a US-based investment strategy analyst at Baird investment bank. ""That's not based on fundamentals. That's pure sentiment."" After the earlier global sell-off of shares, investors were also ""looking for bargains"", said Jane Foley, head of currency strategy at Rabobank. Ms Foley told the BBC's Today programme there were many firms in emerging markets which export agricultural products and raw materials such as metals, so ""perhaps they're going to be doing well in this crisis, because other countries will be looking to buy their commodities from other markets that aren't Russian"". The UK imports 6% of its crude oil and 5% of its gas from Russia, but there have been concerns that sanctions could constrict supplies and drive up prices worldwide. The high price of energy and fuel, with demand surging following the easing of Covid restrictions, is one of the main factors currently driving up the cost of living for people in the UK. Both the RAC and AA motoring groups said average fuel prices hit fresh record highs of 149.67p a litre for petrol, with diesel at 153.05p. Despite the fall on Friday, the AA predicted that petrol would hit 150p per litre over the weekend. There is a lag between crude oil and petrol price movements. Rising oil prices are hitting motorists Both motoring groups said the weak pound combined with crude oil prices would push up costs at the pump. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said ""sadly, more increases are on the way"" due to the rise in the price of crude oil and the pound weakening against the dollar, ""making wholesale fuel more expensive to buy for retailers in the UK"". Gas prices have seen big fluctuations since Russia's military action began. UK wholesale gas prices soared nearly 60% on Thursday but on Friday prices were down more than 18%.

VISUAL GUIDE:Tracking the invasion in maps FROM KYIV:Sheltering from rockets in basements FROM MOSCOW:Shock and support in Russian capital Russia is the second largest exporter of crude oil after Saudi Arabia. It is also the world's biggest exporter of natural gas. Europe gets nearly a third of its oil and around 40% of its gas from Russia, much of it flowing through pipelines across Ukrainian territory. Concerns remain that sanctions could constrict supplies and drive up prices worldwide. Despite the inflation risk, analysts said the stock market rally reflects in part investor bets that uncertainty from the conflict will make central banks - in particular, the US Federal Reserve - move more cautiously to raise interest rates. Fear of aggressive action has been a major factor driving prices lower in recent weeks. ""With all of this uncertainty weighing, and part of that, the way high oil prices and high gas prices might weigh on consumer spending in the US, I think they'll be more hesitant,"" said Mr Mayfield of Baird.

More false Ukraine conflict images shared online,"Some videos, such as this clip of an aerial attack, are from previous conflicts The second day of the Russian invasion of Ukraine has been accompanied by further false or misleading imagery on social media claiming to be from the conflict. Some show military action taken from older conflicts, while other viral videos have proved difficult to verify. One video clip seen by the BBC and proven to be several years old has been viewed more than 27 million times in one day, while another showed video game footage. Misleading posts have come from ""official"" sources as well as from ""ordinary"" social media users. One example was a tweet posted by the verified account of the Ukrainian Ministry of Defence. This dogfight footage comes from a video game Footage of an aerial dogfight is accompanied by the caption ""MiG-29 of the Air Force of the Armed Forces destroys the 'unparalleled' Su-35 of the Russian occupiers"". However, it's video game footage from the game Digital Combat Simulator World. This isn't the first time that game footagehas been used to illustrate military action. One clip of old and incorrectly labelled footage has been viewed over 18 million times on video-sharing platform TikTok. Russian and Ukrainian troops did face off against each other, but this happened in 2014 It claims to show Ukrainian troops ""facing off"" with Russian soldiers at an airbase. While it does show a confrontation between Ukrainian and Russian forces, fact-checkers Logically have ascertained that the footage was shot in 2014 during the annexation of Crimea, and was shot at the Belbek airbase near Sevastopol. The same footagewas aired by BBC Turkish at the time,external, after it was broadcast by Turkish television. This is footage from the Syrian conflict One video, which was posted on both Facebook and Twitter from an unofficial account supporting Ukraine's armed forces, claims to show the destruction of Russian personnel and equipment in Ukraine, as seen through a drone aircraft's gunsight. However, it's footage from Syria shot in 2020. The new version sees the image flipped, perhaps in an attempt to prevent verification through reverse-image search tools. The Twitter post was subsequently deleted. Another incorrectly labelled clip on Twitter claims to be of a Russian airstrike on Ukraine ""that caused a chain reaction at the Luhansk power plant"". This post incorrectly passes off the deadly Tianjin explosions as warfare in Ukraine Various uploads of the clip have been viewed hundreds of thousands of times. The video actually shows footage of the 12 August 2015 Tianjin blasts in China, which killed around 173 people when a container containing chemicals exploded at a port. A BBC report on the Chinese incidentcan be viewed here. One TikTok video has been viewed 27.5m times and shared by thousands of users who assumed that it was from Ukraine. The clip shows some men in military fatigues shouting and laughing in Russian as they parachute over farmland. Many social media users think this clip shows Russian forces landing in Ukraine Although the caption just says ""Original sound - Roman"", users have assumed that the video is of Russian troops taking part in the invasion. In fact, it's footage shot by a man who appears to be a member of the Russian armed forces, and uploaded to his Instagram channel in 2015. He uploaded the old footage to his TikTok channel on 24 February, the day of the Russian invasion of the Ukraine, leading to viewers thinking it was footage from the conflict. This rocket barrage probably took place during military drills in 2018 More old footage on Twitter includes video of a rocket barrage, implying it is part of the Ukraine war. In fact it's from 2018, and shows a barrage launched from Multiple Launch Rocket Systems (MLRS). A tweet from 2018 shows the same footage, although there is some doubt about the accuracy of the caption. In some cases it has been impossible to verify the truth behind a viral post. One example is that of a video clip of a missile being fired toward a residential area in Kyiv by a low-flying jet. The footage has been viewed more than two million times on Twitter. However, the aircraft is travelling too fast and the video is of too poor a quality to verify which country's air force the plane belongs to. There is also debate as to whether the residential area was deliberately targeted, or if the missile was fired in error. There have also been conflicting claims over the identity and intention of the aircraft. Fast-moving events such as war mean that misleading imagery will inevitably appear on social media. Misinformation is easily shared, often by those who believe the images to be genuine. Misleading images shared online on first day of Ukraine conflict Social media users can limit the spread of bad information by taking a few seconds before sharing, to consider whether what they're seeing seems genuine and is from a source that they trust. Checking with multiple trusted sources can help to prevent these images from being widely shared.

UK troops will not fight against Russia - Wallace,"This video can not be played Wallace: We'd like to throw Russia out of Swift banking system British troops will not be sent to Ukraine to fight Russia, Defence Secretary Ben Wallace has confirmed. Speaking to the BBC, Mr Wallace said Ukraine would instead be supported to ""fight every street with every piece of equipment we can get to them"". Russia launched its invasion of Ukraine on Thursday morning and its forces have now advanced on thecapital Kyiv. Mr Wallace said Russia failed in its main objectives on the first day of its offensive, losing 450 of its troops. Over the past month, UK government ministers haverepeatedly stressed that UK troops would be unlikely to take part in actionwithin Ukraine. Mr Wallace explained that sending UK troops to fight in Ukraine - an ally of the UK but not a member of the Nato military alliance it is part of - would trigger a European war. What is Nato and how is it responding to the Ukraine crisis? He said the UK had ""done the next best thing, which is to train more than 20,000 Ukrainians, provided them with lethal capabilities, which they are using right now"". Since the invasion began in the early hours of Thursday, 194 Ukrainians - including 57 civilians - have been killed, Armed Forces Minister James Heappey said. Prime Minister Boris Johnson spoke to Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky on Friday morning, pledging more support in coming days. Mr Zelensky said Ukraine ""needs the support of partners more than ever"" and called for stronger sanctions. LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine? FROM KYIV:""There is no safe place any more"" FROM MOSCOW:Shock and support in Russian capital IN MAPS:How Russia carried out the invasion Kyiv was hit by blasts overnight and tanks have been filmed entering the city for the first time. Fighting has also been raging at an airfield on Kyiv's outskirts and there have been reports of gunfire inside the city. Mr Zelensky has appealed to Russia for a ceasefire. Meanwhile, UN estimates suggested more than 100,000 people have already fled their homes in Ukraine. Overnight, at least 1,000 Ukrainians arrived by train in Poland's south-eastern city of Przemysl alone. Mr Heappey told the House of Commons that further troops were being sent to Estonia earlier than planned to help the Nato ally. A total of 1,000 troops are on standby to help Ukraine's neighbouring countries handle refugees fleeing Ukraine. A Royal Navy destroyer, HMS Diamond, has set sail to be on standby in the eastern Mediterranean. The Type 45 destroyer is joining offshore patrol vessel HMS Trent, with four additional RAF Typhoon jets being deployed to Cyprus to take part in patrols. HMS Diamond has also left Portsmouth Naval Base as part of the UK's response to support Nato countries in eastern Europe. Mr Heappey said ""British and Nato troops should not [and] must not play an active role"" and that any miscalculation could escalate quickly. Members of the Ukrainian National Guard in Kyiv on Friday Mr Wallace warned Russian President Vladimir Putin would not stop after invading Ukraine. But he said the decision not to ""put British service personnel in direct fighting"" was not about risk. The defence secretary said: ""I'm not putting British troops directly to fight Russian troops. That would trigger a European war because we are a Nato country and Russia would therefore be attacking Nato."" Asked about the possibility of a no-fly zone above Russia, he replied this would mean putting ""British fighter jets directly against Russian fighter jets"", adding: ""Nato would have to effectively declare war on Russia because that's what you would do."" He called Russia's assault a ""naked, aggressive, military invasion"" and said he believed diplomacy was currently ""absolutely off the table"". Charities urge UK to welcome refugees Kuenssberg: Ministers braced for 'long and serious' conflict Simpson: Is this a new Cold War? Nato - the North Atlantic Treaty Organisation - is a military alliance formed in 1949 by 12 countries, including the US, Canada, the UK and France. Members agree to come to one another's aid in the event of an armed attack against any one member state, under itsArticle 5,external. Ukraine is not a member but wants to be - it is currently a Nato partner country, meaning there is an understanding it could be allowed to join in future. Russia had wanted assurances this would never be allowed to happen. The UKimposed new sanctionson Russia on Thursday, including targeting major Russian banks and oligarchs. Sanctions will also be applied to Belarus, a long-term ally of Russia, for its role in the assault on Ukraine. Russian military convoys crossed from Belarus into Ukraine's northern Chernihiv region. The Belarus ambassador to the UK, Maxim Yermalovich, was summoned to the UK Foreign Office over the invasion. Minister for Europe and North America James Cleverly made clear Belarus had ""aided and abetted"" Russia's ""reckless aggression"", the Foreign Office said. Mr Wallace also said work was under way to try to get the Swift international payment system ""turned off for Russia"". While that is the UK aim, the defence secretary said ""like so many things these are international organisations, and if not every country wants them to be thrown out of the Swift system, it becomes difficult"". The prime minister is to use an extraordinary summit of leaders of Nato on Friday afternoon to press for Russia to be excluded from Swift, which allows financial transactions to be made around the world. The UK Parliament is on standby to be recalled over the weekend as ""further measures"" and ""further sanctions"" are needed, Speaker Sir Lindsay Hoyle said. In other developments on Friday, British airlines have beenbanned from travelling across Russian airspaceor landing at its airports. It follows the UK decision to ban Russian airline Aeroflot from landing in the UK.

Defiant Ukrainian president asks Europe to do more,"This video can not be played Watch: Warning shots are fired to disperse crowds trying to flee at Kyiv train station A defiant Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has urged European countries to do more to help as he urged his citizens to halt Russia's invasion. The second day of fighting saw tanks enter the capital, Kyiv, for the first time. Ukrainian officials said they have handed out 18,000 guns to volunteers, as well as issuing instructions on how to make petrol bombs. Analysts suggest Russia's advance has been slowed by fierce resistance. A senior US official told Reuters news agency that Russia had encountered more resistance than anticipated, robbing the Russian force of momentum. Volunteers with no combat experience have been seen queueing to join the Ukrainian defence, while age restrictions for joining the army have been dropped. The UK's Chief of Defence Intelligence, Sir Jim Hockenhull, said that Russian forces continue to advance towards the capital - but that Ukrainian Armed Forces ""continue to offer strong resistance, focusing on the defence of key cities"". Russia is continuing its assault from the north, south and east. In the evening, Kyiv came under fresh missile strikes, with explosions reported near a power plant and the sound of gunfire in the city Loud explosions have been reported in the second-largest city, Kharkiv in the north-east, with Ukrainians saying they have stalled a Russian advance Mariupol, a strategically important port city on the Sea of Azov to the south, is reportedly under attack A group of 13 soldiers on Zmiinyi (Snake) island are being honoured as heroes after they diedrefusing to surrender to a Russian warship Ukraine says at least 137 people - civilians and soldiers - have been killed, while Russia has not admitted any deaths on its side More than 100,000 people are estimated to have fled their homes, heading to family or fleeing for the border. The US, UK and EU have all levied financial punishment on Moscow, but stopped short of removing Russia from the international banking system, Swift. However, Mr Zelensky said Western nations - and nearby Europe in particular - must go further and ""act without delay"". ""Europe has enough strength to stop this aggression,"" he said. ""The columns of tanks and the air strikes are very similar to what Europe saw a long time ago, during WW2 - something about which it said 'never again',"" he said. ""But here it is, again. Now, in 2022. 75 years after World War Two ended."" He said all counter-measures must be considered - including throwing Russia out of Swift, imposing visa bans and closing airspace to Russia. The Ukrainian president's appeal came as Russia offered talks with Ukraine for the first time since the crisis began, but under restrictive conditions. Mr Zelensky has been seeking talks with Vladimir Putin since before the invasion began. Why has Putin invaded Ukraine? Ukraine maps: Tracking Russia's invasion BBC Ukraine editor: There is no safe place any more Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov said Russia was prepared for talks with Ukraine, but only in the context of ""demilitarisation"" and about Ukraine's ""neutral status"". Russia has said that Ukraine can never be allowed to join the Nato military alliance, a long-held ambition of Ukraine's. Russia's Foreign Minister, Sergei Lavrov, said earlier that no talks could take place until Ukraine's military laid down its arms. But President Zelensky has given no indication that he would accept talks under those conditions. Addressing the armed forces, Mr Zelensky said: ""Stand strong. You are all that we have. You are all that is protecting our state."" Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg, meanwhile, said the alliance would continue to supply weapons to Ukraine and would is deploying thousands of troops to Europe to shore up defences of member nations. A solider inspects the remains of a plane shot down over the Ukrainian capital, Kiev Vladimir Putin responded with his own speech, suggesting that Ukrainian forces should turn against and overthrow Mr Zelensky's government. Repeating an often-used baseless allegation that Mr Zelensky - a Jewish man - is a ""neo-Nazi"", Mr Putin also labelled the Ukrainian leadership as terrorists and drug dealers. He accused Ukraine of installing missiles and other heavy weaponry in civilian buildings, using residents as human shields, which he said was based on advice from foreign - particularly US - advisers. But global human rights group Amnesty International said it was Russia, not Ukraine, that was showing ""a blatant disregard for civilian lives"". The charity said,externalthat Mr Putin's claim of precise strikes on military targets was false, and Russia was ""using ballistic missiles and other explosive weapons with wide area effects in densely populated areas"". Strikes have hit hospitals, among other targets that Amnesty said ""can constitute war crimes"". Nick Beake, BBC News, Kyiv As we head out on to the streets of Kyiv, we find men in trainers and jeans with rifles slung across their backs - manning checkpoints, or hidden in the trees on the side of the road behind anti-tank weapons. As we push on further, we find professional soldiers braced for a last stand. They are accompanied by Ukrainian artillery and tanks facing the Russian position, less than 30km (19 miles) from the heart of the capital. And we soon find signs of the battle drawing even nearer with a truck ablaze in the middle of the road. Around the corner, my colleague Abdujalil Abdurasulov and I find Olena's family, a group of five. They've got a flat tyre at the worst possible time. They frantically try to change it as they bundle a baby into the back seat. ""We're really afraid"", Olena's mother tells us, before another loud bang silences everyone. This video can not be played The BBCâs Nick Beake and his team met one family trying to flee the capital As I ask her what she thinks of President Putin's attack on her country, an even louder blast pierces the air. She lifts her arms up and says: ""You hear that, that was him."" As we drive on, we spot soldiers lined along wide ridges crossing the river Dnipro. Some Ukrainian snipers are lying on their fronts, looking down their sights. We see the faces of young men, understandably anxious. There is an undoubted fear it could be just a matter of hours before the Russians confront them face to face and try to seize their capital. Tens of thousands are believed to have fled from the major cities. The United Nations refugee agency estimated on Thursday that more than 100,000 people had left their homes, and up to five million could be displaced by the invasion over time. European nations are preparing for an influx of refugees, and a steady stream of people - mainly families - have arrived by car and on foot at the borders of neighbouring EU members Poland and Hungary. The UN's refugee commissioner, Filippo Grandi, said more than 50,000 had left the country in the previous 48 hours - most to Poland and Moldova. The European Union agreed to freeze personal assets belonging to Mr Putin and Mr Lavrov - though it is not clear if either have significant assets inside the EU.The UK said it would also put personal sanctions on both men""imminently"", but did not provide details. Later in the day, the United States also said it would take similar action against both men. White House Press Secretary Jen Psaki said that precise details would come later, but that a travel ban blocking entry to the US would be a standard part of such sanctions. Russia has also been banned from cultural and sporting events as a result of the invasion. It was excluded from the 2022 Eurovision Song Contest, with organisers saying Russia's presence could being the competition into disrepute. TheFormula 1 motor race in Sochi, Russia in September has now been cancelled, and Paris will host the European football Champions League final, not St Petersburg.

Millions of Covid vaccine doses wasted in England,"Around 4.7 million Covid vaccine doses - 4% of the total - ended up as wastage in England by the end of October 2021, a government report reveals. AstraZeneca shots made up 1.9m. The National Audit Office (NAO), which scrutinises spending of public money, says the wastage is far lower than projected for the country's most ambitious vaccination programme ever. Experts had assumed 20% of stocks might not be used, because of handling and storage problems or expiry dates. The report praises the rollout overall, but says there were challenges. How many people are vaccinated in the UK? Children aged 5-11 to be offered Covid vaccine That includes being left with too many expiring AstraZeneca doses, after experts recommended that people under 40 should preferably be given the Pfizer or Moderna vaccines, toavoid a rare but possible link to blood clots. Some wastage was avoided by redirecting 4.5 million AstraZeneca doses to other countries, but stocks already at local sites had to be destroyed in line with regulations. Approximately 1.9 million doses were written off. The NAO says the vaccine programme met ""stretching and unprecedented targets"" to save lives. Uptake exceeded expectations. By the end of October, it had administered around 87 million doses - about six times the number in the previous annual flu vaccine programme. Despite the success and efforts to address inequalities, lower vaccination rates persist in some groups, such as pregnant women and black and Asian communities, the report warns. And there are issues that could threaten the programme's continuing success next winter: ""Staffing issues, including burnout, and a lack of surplus capacity in the healthcare system, present substantial risks."" Gareth Davies, head of the NAO, said: ""The vaccine programme has been successful in getting early access to what were brand new vaccines, securing supply of them, and administering them to a large proportion of the population at unprecedented speed. ""The programme must now redouble its efforts to reach those who are not yet vaccinated, while also considering what a more sustainable model will involve as it moves out of its emergency phase."" Dr Gary Howsam, from the Royal College of GPs, said the health service had ""pulled out all the stops"" to ensure as many people as possible were protected from Covid. GPs and community pharmacists have ended up administering many more doses than originally planned - 71% up to the end of October 2021, compared with a planned 56%. Dr Howsam said: ""It's a fantastic achievement that so many people have been vaccinated, with uptake exceeding initial planning assumptions - and this report does not take into account the booster programme, which has now seen more than 38m patients fully protected from the virus. ""It remains crucial that patients continue to get as much protection as possible so that we can move from a pandemic to an endemic Covid situation and GP teams will remain key to this effort. ""With that being the case, it is urgent that the government delivers on its pledges of 6,000 more GPs and 26,000 more members of the wider practice team, so that general practice can continue to utilise its expertise at delivering vaccination programmes, as well as delivering all the other care and services our patients rely on us for.""

Specialist courts needed for rape cases - reportWatchdogs say rape victims are being failed by a system beset by delays and poor communication.UK,"Specialist courts dealing solely with rape offences are needed to reduce a large case backlog and reduce victims' trauma, a watchdogs' report urges. The BBC understands that Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab is taking advice on the feasibility of such courts. Victims of rape are being failed by a system beset by delays and poor communication, the report by the police and prosecution service watchdogs says. One victim told the authors her court experience had been ""horrendous"". The report by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and HM Crown Prosecution Inspectorate highlights that in England and Wales: on average 706 days elapsed from the date of reporting an offence, to a case reaching court communication with victims was often poor, particularly once someone had been charged in more than half of the cases the inspectors looked at, trial dates were postponed without notice Another victim recalled 21 court delays, mostly with 24 hours' notice, and the case, which was expected to last four days, ultimately took 10 months. All this contributes to successful prosecutions of rape remaining unacceptably low, the inspectors argue. The report focuses on figures for the year to March 2021, which show 52,207 cases of rape were recorded by police. But charges were brought in only 3,144 cases, and just 1,109 resulted in a successful prosecution. Long delay for hundreds of rape cases, says report Police and CPS in rape case blame game, says report Ministers 'deeply ashamed' of low rape conviction rates Victims whose cases made it to court said their experiences had been traumatic. ""I was not expecting it to be easy,"" one told the inspectors. ""But it felt as though the victim and perpetrator roles were reversed, such was the ferocity of the questioning. ""It was the most horrendous experience that I would never wish upon anyone, and it haunts me still."" The report's recommendations include measures to: significantly improve communications with victims introduce specialist rape offence courts to help clear a significant case backlog appoint a victims' commissioner with explicit responsibility for serious sexual offences ""Victim care and support is an absolute moral imperative, and these victims have gone through extremely traumatic experiences,"" said Wendy Williams, Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary. Andrew Cayley, HM Chief Inspector of the Crown Prosecution Inspectorate, suggested some of the government's pop-up Nightingale Courts, set up during the pandemic, could be used as specialist rape courts. Judges already have ""a great deal of discretion on how a victim of rape is questioned"", said Mr Cayley. They can already allow victims to give evidence on video or behind a screen. The aim would be that ""this terrifying experience that victims have often had in courts under cross-examination is not eliminated, but certainly heavily reduced"", he said. The government said ministers would consider the report's recommendations carefully. ""We are recruiting more specialist prosecutors, investing millions to deliver justice more swiftly, transforming the response to rape cases, focusing on the alleged suspects rather than complainants' credibility, and ensuring that victims receive the support they deserve,"" said an official. The BBC also understands that Mr Raab is taking advice on how specialist courts, dealing solely with rape cases, could work. ""This is a sobering and considered analysis,"" he said in a statement. Ruth Davison, chief executive of the domestic abuse charity Refuge, welcomed the report's call for widespread reform. ""The government has committed to ensuring survivors are 'better heard, served and protected', and this report shows that those actions are desperately needed,"" she said. The director of public prosecutions for England and Wales, Max Hill QC, said the Crown Prosecution Service was committed to making the changes needed to ensure more victims of sexual offences see justice. Chief Constable Sarah Crew, National Police Chiefs' Council lead for adult sex offences, said work was under way to improve the policing response. ""We understand change isn't happening fast enough, but this is an opportunity to bring about real and sustainable change to the handling of these traumatic offences, to transform the victim experience and bring more perpetrators to justice,"" she said.

Ukraine honours guards killed defending island,"Zmiinyi (Snake) Island is located 48km (30 miles) south of Ukraine's mainland in the Black Sea Ukraine has honoured 13 soldiers who were killed defending a tiny island after reportedly swearing at a Russian ship that ordered them to surrender. In unverified audio clips, the borders guards defending Zmiinyi Island in the Black Sea are told to ""lay down your weapons"" or ""be bombed"". ""Russian warship, go to hell,"" they respond. Ukraine says they were then killed by air and sea strikes. Russia denies the account, saying they all surrendered. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has awarded each of the guards the posthumous title of ""Hero of Ukraine"". ""On our Zmiinyi Island, defending it to the last, all the border guards died heroically,"" Mr Zelensky said. In the audio recordings, shared by a Ukrainian government official, the soldiers can be heard exchanging barbed comments with the Russian vessel. ""This is a Russian warship,"" one voice says in the clip. ""I propose you lay down your weapons and surrender to avoid bloodshed and unnecessary victims. Otherwise you will be bombed"" According to the audio, the Ukrainian soldiers can then be heard speaking amongst themselves, agreeing ""this is it"", before their final ""go to hell"". According to Ukrainian officials, those were the last words heard from the island before Russia began strikes and Kyiv lost contact with the island. The official Russian account of the incident differs dramatically. Moscow said the 82 Ukrainian soldiers on the island surrendered it to them voluntarily and made no mention of carrying out strikes or inflicting casualties. Snake Island is a roughly 16-hectare (40-acre) rocky island owned by Ukraine that lies about 300km (186 miles) west of Crimea. Ukraine says 137 of its civilians and military personnel were killed during Russia's invasion on Thursday. LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine?

Kuenssberg: Ministers braced for 'long and serious' conflict,"Downing Street was illuminated in yellow and blue on Thursday in symbolic support of Ukraine War in Europe. Despite all the warnings, all the prime minister's war-era warnings at the weekend, all the distressing images emerging from Ukraine - that is still a sentence that's surreal to write in the UK in the 2020s. Politicians here are universally horrified by what they see. They are vowing to stick together. Disagreements over the approach to take towards the Russian aggression are largely only over the scale and pace of the response, not the overall approach. There is also a grisly acceptance that the UK's chosen approach to confronting Vladimir Putin will not immediately make that much difference. Your guide to understanding the Ukraine invasion What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? How hard will it be to defend Ukraine? The Russian leader knew there would be sanctions if he invaded. And it happened anyway. So the application of those sanctions will not put brakes on the tanks as they roll on. The prognosis is not certain, but sources briefed on UK intelligence say it's not unlikely that the Russians may be able to overwhelm the Ukrainian forces soon - with ""ominous assessments"" given to the cabinet on Thursday night. The likely short-term outcome therefore is Russia messily occupying the country, with a dogged Ukrainian insurgency and the West's sanctions surely - but slowly - squeezing Russia's economy. One minister told me that we are therefore in for a ""long and serious"" conflict. Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is understood to hold this view too. And just as no one expects the conflict to be over soon, no one expects its effects to be here and then gone. For our politicians - the prime minister and of course his counterparts around the West - the challenge is so huge. They are the first political generation in decades to have to grapple with a war of this nature in our continent. UK intelligence fears Russia may overwhelm Ukraine soon - but the conflict could last much longer Their adversary is unpredictable and they don't have easy answers, not least because the UK and its allies have no intention of putting their own boots on the ground. The West wants to fight Mr Putin's real weapons with economic ones - it is a not a symmetrical fight. And for all of us, it shakes the stable order we have, broadly speaking, lived with for decades. This changes the political atmosphere, and the backdrop against which the government makes all sorts of decisions on our behalf. In really practical terms too this conflict is at once a thousand miles away and right here. We will all feel it, in the price of petrol at the pump, even the cost of a loaf of bread. The price of oil, the price of wheat, the effect on the financial markets that feed through to our pensions, our pay. Inflation is already running hot. Money is stretching less far. Our economy's still recovering from the battering of another shock, a global pandemic. This conflict might slam the brakes on the journey out of that. The events of the last 24 hours are evidence of the real fight some in the West have long feared may come. A battle for ideas, played out in real life that others perhaps wished would never come. Why Ukraine crisis could cause global price rises 'This is worse than my wildest nightmares' But it's here now. Downing Street was bathed last night in the yellow and blue light of the Ukrainian flag. It was a display of the UK's genuine wish to show support to Ukraine. The UK's politicians are unusually united in the need to stand completely firm. But few in Westminster can hope the UK's actions can bring an end quickly to what's happening. Symbols and sanctions may not be enough to make Mr Putin stop.

Why Biden won't send troops to Ukraine,"Joe Biden addressed the nation - most of whom share his caution about risking US lives President Joe Biden has spent enormous diplomatic capital on countering Russian aggression toward Ukraine. His administration relentlessly broadcast doomsday warnings about an impending invasion - which proved to be correct - and declared that no less than the international order was at stake. But Mr Biden has also made clear that the Americans are not willing to fight, even though the Russians clearly are. Furthermore, he's ruled out sending forces into Ukraine to rescue US citizens, should it come to that. And he's actually pulled out troops who were serving in the country as military advisers and monitors. Why has he drawn this red line in the most consequential foreign policy crisis of his presidency? First of all, Ukraine isn't in America's neighbourhood. It is not located on the US border. Nor does it host a US military base. It does not have strategic oil reserves, and it's not a major trade partner. But that lack of national interest hasn't stopped former presidents from expending blood and treasure on behalf of others in the past. In 1995 Bill Clinton intervened militarily in the war that followed the collapse of Yugoslavia. And in 2011 Barack Obama did the same in the Libyan civil war, both largely on humanitarian and human rights grounds. US troops in Bosnia in 1995 as part of a Nato force In 1990 George H W Bush justified his international coalition to expel Iraq from Kuwait as defending the rule of law against the rule of the jungle. Biden's top national security officials have used similar language when describing Russia's threat to international principles of peace and security. But they have been preaching a response of economic warfare through crippling sanctions as a response, not military operations. This has something to do with President Biden's non-interventionist instincts. Granted, they were developed over time. He supported US military action in the 1990s to deal with ethnic conflicts in the Balkans. And he voted for America's ill-fated invasion of Iraq in 2003. But since then he's become more wary of using US military power. He opposed Obama's intervention in Libya as well as his surge of troops in Afghanistan. He resolutely defends his order to withdraw US forces from Afghanistan last year despite the chaos that accompanied it and the humanitarian catastrophe left in its wake. And his top diplomat Antony Blinken - a Biden ""Whisperer"" who's crafted the president's foreign policy over some 20 years of working at his side - has defined national security to be more about combating climate change, fighting global diseases and competing with China than about military interventionism. A recent AP-NORC poll found 72% said the US should play a minor role in the Russia-Ukraine conflict, or none at all. They are focused on pocketbook issues, particularly rising inflation, something Biden has to be mindful of as mid-term elections loom. In Washington the crisis is consuming lawmakers on both sides of the aisle, who are demanding the toughest of sanctions. But even reliably hawkish voices like Republican Senator Ted Cruz don't want Biden to send American troops into Ukraine and ""start a shooting war with Putin."" Rising petrol prices are a worry Another foreign policy hawk, Republican Senator Marco Rubio, has said war between the world's two largest nuclear powers would not be good for anybody. That's the bottom line - Putin's stockpile of nuclear warheads. Biden doesn't want to spark a ""world war"" by risking a direct clash between American and Russian troops in Ukraine and he's been open about that. ""It's not like we're dealing with a terrorist organisation,"" the president told NBC earlier this month. ""We're dealing with one of the largest armies in the world. This is a very difficult situation, and things could go crazy quickly."" LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine? FROM KYIV:""There is no safe place any more"" FROM MOSCOW:Shock and support in Russian capital IN MAPS:How Russia carried out the invasion Nor are there treaty obligations compelling the US to take this risk. An attack against any Nato country is an attack against all - the foundational Article 5 commitment that binds all members to defend one another. But Ukraine is not a member of Nato, a factor that's been cited by Blinken to explain why the Americans will not fight for the values they so strenuously extol. There is a certain irony here, given that the conflict is about Putin's demands for guarantees that Ukraine never be allowed to join the military alliance, and Nato's refusal to give them. The Harvard professor and foreign policy realist Stephen Walthas argued the rejection of compromise by the US and other Nato countries,externaldoes not make practical sense given their unwillingness to put any military muscle behind it. President Biden has in fact been sending troops to Europe and redeploying those already there, to bolster Nato allies that border Ukraine and Russia. This has been billed by the administration as an effort to reassure former Soviet republics nervous about Putin's wider goal of pressuring Nato to roll back forces from its eastern flank. But the invasion of Ukraine this week has stoked concerns about the prospect of wider conflict - either an accidental spillover or a deliberate attack by Russia. The latter would be a major escalation, invoking the Article 5 mutual Nato defence commitment. But either could draw US forces into a battle. ""If he did move into Nato countries,"" Mr Biden has said, ""we will be involved.""

Oil rises as Russia invasion nears Ukraine capital,"Soldiers examine the remains of a missile near Kyiv Global markets soared on Friday as investor concerns eased about the severity of sanctions imposed on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. Coordinated Western sanctions against Russia have targeted its banks but left its energy sector largely untouched. After sharp falls on Thursday, stock markets in the UK and Europe jumped more than 3%. US exchanges also rose. Oil prices reversed early gains on Friday and fell by more than 2% but are still trading near seven-year highs. Brent crude - the international benchmark for oil prices - dropped below $98 a barrel. The share price gains followed weeks of declines, fuelled in part by concerns about Europe's most severe conflict since World War Two. While the sanctions against Russia include freezing bank assets and cutting off state-owned enterprises, they stopped short of disconnecting Russia from the Swift international banking system or targeting its oil and gas exports, which some analysts said had helped stock markets start to recover. ""It's not that the market is saying the war is good news. They were worried about the war and selling off, and now it's happened and paradoxically it's not as bad as the worst case scenario, at least not yet,"" said Jonas Golterman, senior markets economist at Capital Economics. The UK'sFTSE 100 indexrose 3.9%- the biggest daily gain since November 2020 when Pfizer announced a vaccine breakthrough - and stock markets in Germany and France closed more than 3.5% higher. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 2.5% higher, while the S&P 500 rose 2.2% and the Nasdaq climbed 1.6%, extending gains from Thursday. Markets in Asia also closed higher. Why Ukraine crisis could cause global price rises What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? The gains came despite fighting across Ukraine on Friday forced tens of thousands of people from their homes. The US, UK and EU said Friday they would place sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin, but China's foreign ministry also reported that Mr Putin might be willing to hold talks with Ukraine. ""This is a very sentiment driven market right now, so if there is even a whisper that there might be willingness to talk, the market will rally and rally hard,"" said Ross Mayfield, a US-based investment strategy analyst at Baird investment bank. ""That's not based on fundamentals. That's pure sentiment."" After the earlier global sell-off of shares, investors were also ""looking for bargains"", said Jane Foley, head of currency strategy at Rabobank. Ms Foley told the BBC's Today programme there were many firms in emerging markets which export agricultural products and raw materials such as metals, so ""perhaps they're going to be doing well in this crisis, because other countries will be looking to buy their commodities from other markets that aren't Russian"". The UK imports 6% of its crude oil and 5% of its gas from Russia, but there have been concerns that sanctions could constrict supplies and drive up prices worldwide. The high price of energy and fuel, with demand surging following the easing of Covid restrictions, is one of the main factors currently driving up the cost of living for people in the UK. Both the RAC and AA motoring groups said average fuel prices hit fresh record highs of 149.67p a litre for petrol, with diesel at 153.05p. Despite the fall on Friday, the AA predicted that petrol would hit 150p per litre over the weekend. There is a lag between crude oil and petrol price movements. Rising oil prices are hitting motorists Both motoring groups said the weak pound combined with crude oil prices would push up costs at the pump. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said ""sadly, more increases are on the way"" due to the rise in the price of crude oil and the pound weakening against the dollar, ""making wholesale fuel more expensive to buy for retailers in the UK"". Gas prices have seen big fluctuations since Russia's military action began. UK wholesale gas prices soared nearly 60% on Thursday but on Friday prices were down more than 18%. LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine? VISUAL GUIDE:Tracking the invasion in maps FROM KYIV:Sheltering from rockets in basements FROM MOSCOW:Shock and support in Russian capital Russia is the second largest exporter of crude oil after Saudi Arabia. It is also the world's biggest exporter of natural gas. Europe gets nearly a third of its oil and around 40% of its gas from Russia, much of it flowing through pipelines across Ukrainian territory. Concerns remain that sanctions could constrict supplies and drive up prices worldwide. Despite the inflation risk, analysts said the stock market rally reflects in part investor bets that uncertainty from the conflict will make central banks - in particular, the US Federal Reserve - move more cautiously to raise interest rates. Fear of aggressive action has been a major factor driving prices lower in recent weeks. ""With all of this uncertainty weighing, and part of that, the way high oil prices and high gas prices might weigh on consumer spending in the US, I think they'll be more hesitant,"" said Mr Mayfield of Baird.

Specialist courts needed for rape cases - report,"Specialist courts dealing solely with rape offences are needed to reduce a large case backlog and reduce victims' trauma, a watchdogs' report urges. The BBC understands that Deputy Prime Minister Dominic Raab is taking advice on the feasibility of such courts. Victims of rape are being failed by a system beset by delays and poor communication, the report by the police and prosecution service watchdogs says. One victim told the authors her court experience had been ""horrendous"". The report by HM Inspectorate of Constabulary and HM Crown Prosecution Inspectorate highlights that in England and Wales: on average 706 days elapsed from the date of reporting an offence, to a case reaching court communication with victims was often poor, particularly once someone had been charged in more than half of the cases the inspectors looked at, trial dates were postponed without notice Another victim recalled 21 court delays, mostly with 24 hours' notice, and the case, which was expected to last four days, ultimately took 10 months. All this contributes to successful prosecutions of rape remaining unacceptably low, the inspectors argue. The report focuses on figures for the year to March 2021, which show 52,207 cases of rape were recorded by police. But charges were brought in only 3,144 cases, and just 1,109 resulted in a successful prosecution. Long delay for hundreds of rape cases, says report Police and CPS in rape case blame game, says report Ministers 'deeply ashamed' of low rape conviction rates Victims whose cases made it to court said their experiences had been traumatic. ""I was not expecting it to be easy,"" one told the inspectors. ""But it felt as though the victim and perpetrator roles were reversed, such was the ferocity of the questioning. ""It was the most horrendous experience that I would never wish upon anyone, and it haunts me still."" The report's recommendations include measures to: significantly improve communications with victims introduce specialist rape offence courts to help clear a significant case backlog appoint a victims' commissioner with explicit responsibility for serious sexual offences ""Victim care and support is an absolute moral imperative, and these victims have gone through extremely traumatic experiences,"" said Wendy Williams, Her Majesty's Inspector of Constabulary. Andrew Cayley, HM Chief Inspector of the Crown Prosecution Inspectorate, suggested some of the government's pop-up Nightingale Courts, set up during the pandemic, could be used as specialist rape courts. Judges already have ""a great deal of discretion on how a victim of rape is questioned"", said Mr Cayley. They can already allow victims to give evidence on video or behind a screen. The aim would be that ""this terrifying experience that victims have often had in courts under cross-examination is not eliminated, but certainly heavily reduced"", he said. The government said ministers would consider the report's recommendations carefully. ""We are recruiting more specialist prosecutors, investing millions to deliver justice more swiftly, transforming the response to rape cases, focusing on the alleged suspects rather than complainants' credibility, and ensuring that victims receive the support they deserve,"" said an official. The BBC also understands that Mr Raab is taking advice on how specialist courts, dealing solely with rape cases, could work. ""This is a sobering and considered analysis,"" he said in a statement. Ruth Davison, chief executive of the domestic abuse charity Refuge, welcomed the report's call for widespread reform. ""The government has committed to ensuring survivors are 'better heard, served and protected', and this report shows that those actions are desperately needed,"" she said. The director of public prosecutions for England and Wales, Max Hill QC, said the Crown Prosecution Service was committed to making the changes needed to ensure more victims of sexual offences see justice. Chief Constable Sarah Crew, National Police Chiefs' Council lead for adult sex offences, said work was under way to improve the policing response. ""We understand change isn't happening fast enough, but this is an opportunity to bring about real and sustainable change to the handling of these traumatic offences, to transform the victim experience and bring more perpetrators to justice,"" she said.

'Chaotic' youth job scheme failing to deliver - MPs,"The Kickstart programme was launched to help young people into work A Â£1.9bn scheme to help young people into work is helping far fewer than hoped, a committee of MPs has warned. The Public Accounts Committee (PAC) said it supported the intention of targeted help for young workers during the pandemic but the Â£1.9bn ""emergency intervention"" Kickstart scheme has supported far fewer than predicted. ""Early delivery was chaotic,"" the MPs said in their report on Friday. The government said the policy had helped 130,000 young people into work. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP) now forecasts that Kickstart will support 168,000 young people, fewer than the original prediction of 250,000, the report said. The programme, which launched in September 2020, targets young people at risk of long-term unemployment. The report said the DWP ""neglected to put in place basic management information that would be expected for a multi-billion-pound grant programme"". The economic hit of Covid to young people was not as bad first predicted. However, the report found the DWP does not know why many young people who signed up for Universal Credit early in the pandemic have not since come off the benefit and into Kickstart jobs. Dame Meg Hillier, chair of the PAC, said: ""There are very unfortunate similarities across government's Covid response schemes: rushed implementation and too little track kept of whether a scheme was delivering what it promises - even given the unprecedented pressures at the start of the pandemic. ""In this case the department simply has no idea whether this scheme was worth the money, not least because it has little idea what was delivered for it,"" she said. The report recommended the government try to claw back the scheme's Â£1,500 employment support costs where the employer has not used the money as it should have. The PAC report said the programme will likely only place 168,000 people between ages 16 and 24 into job roles Under the Kickstart scheme, businesses apply to the DWP to create Kickstart places, which are then vetted for suitability. People aged between 16 and 24 who are on Universal Credit are matched to roles by their job centre work coaches. They are then interviewed by the prospective employer, which decides whether to give them a role. For each successful placement, the government covers the national minimum wage for a six-month period, at 25 hours per week. A further Â£1,500 grant is available per placement to help cover set-up costs and assist in developing skills. A government spokesperson said Kickstart had ""categorically delivered"". ""It has given more than 130,000 young people opportunities to work, earn and improve their prospects. It responded to extraordinary circumstances at unprecedented pace, as part of the wider Plan for Jobs which has defied forecasts of unemployment rising to 12% - the headline rate is actually 4.1%,"" they said. ""We will consider the PAC's conclusions as we continue our mission to get people into work so they can take home more money,"" they added. More than one year since the scheme was launched, with ""stronger than expected economic growth"", the DWP is now forecasting that Kickstart will support far fewer young people than envisaged - 168,000 compared with the original prediction of 250,000 - and will cost Â£1.26bn. While this scheme was supposed to provide specific help during the pandemic, it could have solved a much longer-running problem - finding a route back into work for young people who've been unemployed for ages, in fact some may never have worked at all. Instead, what the committee's report suggests is a spending splurge, with little help or guidance to employers, no way of measuring success, and no way of seeing that the right young people were recruited. At a moment in the pandemic when the government's purse-strings were loosened for all the right reasons this scheme should have had a lasting legacy of bringing left-behind young people into the world of world. This report suggests an open goal has been bungled. An expensive price tag and little to show for it.

Asia shares rebound after Ukraine sanctions,"Soldiers examine the remains of a missile near Kyiv Global markets soared on Friday as investor concerns eased about the severity of sanctions imposed on Russia following its invasion of Ukraine. Coordinated Western sanctions against Russia have targeted its banks but left its energy sector largely untouched. After sharp falls on Thursday, stock markets in the UK and Europe jumped more than 3%. US exchanges also rose. Oil prices reversed early gains on Friday and fell by more than 2% but are still trading near seven-year highs. Brent crude - the international benchmark for oil prices - dropped below $98 a barrel. The share price gains followed weeks of declines, fuelled in part by concerns about Europe's most severe conflict since World War Two. While the sanctions against Russia include freezing bank assets and cutting off state-owned enterprises, they stopped short of disconnecting Russia from the Swift international banking system or targeting its oil and gas exports, which some analysts said had helped stock markets start to recover. ""It's not that the market is saying the war is good news. They were worried about the war and selling off, and now it's happened and paradoxically it's not as bad as the worst case scenario, at least not yet,"" said Jonas Golterman, senior markets economist at Capital Economics. The UK'sFTSE 100 indexrose 3.9%- the biggest daily gain since November 2020 when Pfizer announced a vaccine breakthrough - and stock markets in Germany and France closed more than 3.5% higher. In the US, the Dow Jones Industrial Average closed 2.5% higher, while the S&P 500 rose 2.2% and the Nasdaq climbed 1.6%, extending gains from Thursday. Markets in Asia also closed higher. Why Ukraine crisis could cause global price rises What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? The gains came despite fighting across Ukraine on Friday forced tens of thousands of people from their homes. The US, UK and EU said Friday they would place sanctions on Russian President Vladimir Putin, but China's foreign ministry also reported that Mr Putin might be willing to hold talks with Ukraine. ""This is a very sentiment driven market right now, so if there is even a whisper that there might be willingness to talk, the market will rally and rally hard,"" said Ross Mayfield, a US-based investment strategy analyst at Baird investment bank. ""That's not based on fundamentals. That's pure sentiment."" After the earlier global sell-off of shares, investors were also ""looking for bargains"", said Jane Foley, head of currency strategy at Rabobank. Ms Foley told the BBC's Today programme there were many firms in emerging markets which export agricultural products and raw materials such as metals, so ""perhaps they're going to be doing well in this crisis, because other countries will be looking to buy their commodities from other markets that aren't Russian"". The UK imports 6% of its crude oil and 5% of its gas from Russia, but there have been concerns that sanctions could constrict supplies and drive up prices worldwide. The high price of energy and fuel, with demand surging following the easing of Covid restrictions, is one of the main factors currently driving up the cost of living for people in the UK. Both the RAC and AA motoring groups said average fuel prices hit fresh record highs of 149.67p a litre for petrol, with diesel at 153.05p. Despite the fall on Friday, the AA predicted that petrol would hit 150p per litre over the weekend. There is a lag between crude oil and petrol price movements. Rising oil prices are hitting motorists Both motoring groups said the weak pound combined with crude oil prices would push up costs at the pump. RAC fuel spokesman Simon Williams said ""sadly, more increases are on the way"" due to the rise in the price of crude oil and the pound weakening against the dollar, ""making wholesale fuel more expensive to buy for retailers in the UK"". Gas prices have seen big fluctuations since Russia's military action began. UK wholesale gas prices soared nearly 60% on Thursday but on Friday prices were down more than 18%. LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine? VISUAL GUIDE:Tracking the invasion in maps FROM KYIV:Sheltering from rockets in basements FROM MOSCOW:Shock and support in Russian capital Russia is the second largest exporter of crude oil after Saudi Arabia. It is also the world's biggest exporter of natural gas. Europe gets nearly a third of its oil and around 40% of its gas from Russia, much of it flowing through pipelines across Ukrainian territory. Concerns remain that sanctions could constrict supplies and drive up prices worldwide. Despite the inflation risk, analysts said the stock market rally reflects in part investor bets that uncertainty from the conflict will make central banks - in particular, the US Federal Reserve - move more cautiously to raise interest rates. Fear of aggressive action has been a major factor driving prices lower in recent weeks. ""With all of this uncertainty weighing, and part of that, the way high oil prices and high gas prices might weigh on consumer spending in the US, I think they'll be more hesitant,"" said Mr Mayfield of Baird.

UK sanctions target Russian banks and oligarchs,"This video can not be played Watch Boris Johnson tell MPs that the UK will squeeze Russia from the global economy Major Russian banks will be excluded from the UK financial system and oligarchs have been targeted in new sanctions announced by Boris Johnson. The prime minister told the House of Commons they were ""the largest and most severe package of economic sanctions that Russia has ever seen"". Russia's national airline Aeroflot will also be banned from landing in the UK. It follows Moscow's invasion of Ukraine which began with air strikes in the early hours of Thursday morning. Mr Johnson told MPs that Russian President Vladimir Putin was a ""bloodstained aggressor"" who would ""stand condemned in the eyes of the world and of history"" for invading Ukraine. Announcing the measures, the prime minister said the UK and its allies had ""tried every avenue for diplomacy until the final hour"", but he believed Mr Putin had always been determined to attack Ukraine. LIVE:Latest updates from on the ground THE BASICS:Why is Putin invading Ukraine? FROM KYIV:""There is no safe place any more"" FROM MOSCOW:Shock and support in Russian capital IN MAPS:How Russian carried out the invasion Mr Johnson said the G7 group of world leaders had agreed to work in unity to ""maximise the economic price that Putin will pay for his aggression"". He also confirmed that sanctions would be applied to Belarus for its role in the assault on Ukraine. Sanctions announced by the prime minister include: All major Russian banks will have their assets frozen and be excluded from the UK financial system. This will stop them from accessing sterling and clearing payments through the UK. This includes a full and immediate freeze of VTB bank Legislation will stop major Russian companies and the state from raising finance or borrowing money on UK markets Asset freezes will be placed on 100 new individuals or businesses Aeroflot will be banned from landing in the UK There will be a suspension of dual-use export licences to cover components which can be used for military purposes Within days the UK will stop exports of high-tech items and oil refinery equipment There will be a limit on deposits Russians can make in UK bank accounts Similar financial sanctions will be extended to Belarus for its role in the assault on Ukraine The UK will bring forward parts of the Economic Crime Bill before the Easter recess Mr Johnson said there was potential to cut Russia out from the Swift international payment system and ""nothing is off the table"" Those being targeted by sanctions include five people deemed to be part of Mr Putin's ""inner circle"", the Foreign Office said in a statement issued after Mr Johnson's announcement. These include Mr Putin's ex-son in law Kirill Shamalov who was previously married to his daughter Katarina and is Russia's youngest billionaire. This video can not be played WATCH: How Russia's invasion of Ukraine unfolded on day one Other targets include Petr Fradkov, head of the recently sanctioned Promsvyazbank and son of the former head of Russian Foreign Intelligence. Businesses targeted include Rostec, Russia's biggest defence company, Tactical Missile Corporation, Russia's leading supplier of air and sea missiles, and Uralvagonzavod, one of the world's largest tank manufacturers, the Foreign Office said. It also said it was moving to cut off wealthy Russians' access to UK banks, including a Â£50,000 limit on bank deposits. Mr Johnson said the UK and its allies' mission was to ensure through diplomatic, economic, and eventually military means that the ""hideous and barbarous venture of Mr Putin"" ended in failure. The prime minister chaired his second emergency Cobra committee of the day on Thursday evening, followed by a cabinet meeting. He told cabinet that the Ukrainian military was fighting back in ""defiance of Putin's attempts to subjugate Ukraine"" and that advisers had given an ""ominous assessment"" of the next few days. Why Ukraine crisis could cause global price rises 'This is worse than my wildest nightmares' John Simpson: Is this a new Cold War? What we know about Ukraine invasion so far Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said the UK would ""not rest until Russia's economy has been degraded and Ukraine's sovereignty and territorial integrity restored"". The new measures expand the sanctions that were announced by the UK government on Tuesday, which included targeting high-net worth individuals and Russian politicians who voted to declare Donetsk and Luhansk independent. A number of MPs and defence experts said those measures had not gone far enough. On Thursday, US President Joe Biden also announced sanctions against Russia, including against its banks and people who ""personally gained from the Kremlin's policies"". There was plenty of criticism that Western sanctions in the days leading up to this invasion did not go far enough, fast enough. These new measures will hit the Russian economy much harder. But there are still potential gaps. The prime minister said sanctions will take place against major Russian banks. But one, Sberbank, was not mentioned. And the Ukrainian government wanted more - in particular moves to disconnect Russia from the international payment system known as Swift. The US and the UK back such a move, but some European countries fear it could damage their own banks. Suspending Russia from Swift is still under consideration, but the hesitation is a reminder that in a globalised world all sanctions tend to have an impact on the countries imposing them as well And the real trouble with sanctions is they don't work quickly. They do increase pressure, and they can do damage. But the international community is not trying to damage the Russian economy just for the sake of it. It wants economic pressure to force a change in President Putin's political and military calculations. Meanwhile, the invasion of Ukraine continues. Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer said he welcomed the sanctions outlined by Mr Johnson, and pledged opposition support for further measures. But he said there were changes that must be made in the UK. ""For too long our country has been a safe haven for money Putin and his fellow bandits stole from the Russian people"" he said. Conservative former Foreign Secretary Jeremy Hunt said that while sanctions are ""extremely welcome"" they should not only be economic and called for a ""fundamental review of our military capability"". Conservative MP Tom Tugendhat, who chairs the Foreign Affairs Committee, urged Mr Johnson to take action against those ""enabling Putin's economy"" - including individuals who sit on the boards of the businesses which finance the Russian president's regime. Liberal Democrat leader Sir Ed Davey said the West ""cannot be complacent any longer"" and called for a reversal of proposed troop cuts to the Army. SNP Westminster leader Ian Blackford called for the ""complete economic isolation of Russia"", including ""clearing up the sewer of dirty Russian money"" in London and suspending Russia from the Swift payment system. Ukrainian protesters gathered outside Downing Street on Thursday afternoon On Thursday morning Russian forces launched an assault on Ukraine, crossing its borders and bombing military targets near big cities. Ukraine has announced martial law across the country, meaning the military has taken control temporarily. Traffic jams have built up as people attempt to flee the capital Kyiv. Meanwhile, the Home Office has said it will allow some Ukrainian nationals in the UK to extend their visas. Those eligible for points-based work visas will be allowed to extend their stay or to switch from visitor visas and seasonal agricultural workers will have their visas automatically extended until the end of 2022.

"Girl, 12, dreams of being future skiing star","Lowri was introduced to skiing by her mother For many young people watching Beijing's Winter Olympics, competing at that level might seem a world away. But for Lowri Howie, 12, from Harlech, Gwynedd, it is far from a pipe dream. She has been skiing since she was four, honing her skills on the dry slope in Llandudno, Conwy, in between visits to the Alps to practice on real snow. This week her meteoric rise in the sport continued with victories at theEnglish Alpine Championships,externalin Bormio, Italy. WATCH: BBC presenter John Watson slips down ski slope SnOasis ski centre plan revived as 'Valley Ridge' How do you solve snowsport's diversity problem? The Covid pandemic has meant long periods when ski facilities were closed and opportunities to travel abroad have been restricted, making Lowri's latest triumph all the more satisfying. Makeshift training activities were quickly adapted, from unicycling and wakeboarding to juggling and box jumps, to keep her sharp until the long-awaited return to the slopes. Lowri has been skiing since she was four ""It was a bit upsetting not being able to go, but then I still kept going with my training, and Instagram posts to keep people entertained,"" said Lowri. ""When the ski resorts opened again I was pretty happy to go back and see my friends and coaches, and being on snow again - it was great to have that feeling again."" Easing restrictions meant an opportunity for Lowri and her mother Einir to travel to Austria, where she has been training at an academy for the past few weeks in preparation for the championships. ""I enjoy watching her skiing, but it can be nerve-wracking!"" said Einir, who previously worked as a ski resort holiday rep and inspired Lowri's love of winter sports. ""We never thought a few years ago we'd be training in Austria now and competing in the Alpine Championships, so we're just taking it step by step and see what happens."" At Lowri's regular training slope in Llandudno, her coaches are in no doubt about her potential to reach the pinnacle of the sport. ""We're very lucky that we've got three Welsh squad members amongst us,"" said Sion Salisbury, a coach at the North Wales Snowsports Club. ""Lowri's among them, and she's one of the best placed racers of her age group in Britain. ""She's very talented, she's a natural skier, she works hard, she's got the right ethos."" Dave Ryding, 35,won Britain's first alpine skiing gold medalin the Kitzbuhel slalom in January. ""He learnt to ski at a similar age to Lowri on a dry ski slope in Pendle,"" said Sion. ""If she's willing to put in the hard work, there's no reason why she can't."" It is an opinion shared by fellow clubmate Molly, who is full of praise for the facility and and her fellow skier's talents. ""We always support each other here, we're like one big family. She's great in her age group, absolutely amazing,"" she said. Lowri tackles her final race at the Alpine Championships on Friday, following a slalom win on Wednesday to go with an opening day victory in her favoured giant slalom event. Lowri hopes to compete in the Winter Olympics ""I absolutely love the giant slalom because there's more of a gap there so it's easier [to pass through] - it's more flowy, and you can go really quick and I love going quick,"" she said And having already met many of Team GB's biggest skiing stars - including being complimented on her slalom by Scottish World Cup racerCharlie Guest- her aspirations of reaching those levels are clear. ""I hope to be there some day in future, and I love to watch them ski,"" said Lowri. ""I really hope my dreams will come true, and I really hope some of my team-mates will join me as well in competitions - and it'd be pretty exciting if I could race with Alex Tilley [Scottish Olympic alpine ski racer] and them in the future."" In the meantime she keeps her friends updated on social media with photos and videos of her skiing - including her successes and occasional mishaps.

Ukraine deaths as battles rage after Russia invasion,"Russian forces launch a full-scale assault on Ukraine, with its military attacking the country from the north, east and south Ukrainian President Zelensky says 137 Ukrainian citizens - both soldiers and civilians - died on Thursday People in the capital, Kyiv, and elsewhere are trying to flee - some 100,000 have left so far, the UN says There are also renewed reports of explosions in the port city of Mariupol, home to half a million people Russians seize control of the Chernobyl complex - site of the world's worst nuclear disaster UK and US announce fresh new sanctions on Russia, including asset freezes on banks President Vladimir Putin defends his move, saying there was no other way to defend Russia But US President Joe Biden says Putin's aggression will cost Russia dearly Edited by Jude Sheerin For technical reasons too boring to explain, we are switching our live coverageto a new webpage here. For all the latest developments on the conflict, please follow us to the new link. President Joe Biden and German Chancellor Olaf Scholz have both said that cutting Russia off from the global banking system, Swift, is not being proposed right now. But what would happen if it was? Excluding Russia from Swift would risk severe repercussions for banks that are owed
money  - either now or in the longer term. This is particularly true in Germany, which has deep financial ties with Russia and feels it has done its share of economic sacrifice by suspending certification of the Nord Stream 2 pipeline. Although being de-Swifted would be disruptive for Russia, there is an alternate system - called CFPS - that Russia set up after it annexed Crimea in 2014. Similarly, China has also set up a secondary system, CIPS. Expelling Russia would probably only push it closer to China and play into the hands of the Xi administration, which is keen to ""de-dollarise"" the world's financial architecture. This would accelerate that trend and ambition. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky reportedly just said ""the enemy has designated me as the target number one, and my family as the target number two"". In a video address carried by Ukrainian media, Zelensky says he is staying in the capital Kyiv's ""government quarters"" and his family is also in Ukraine. He did not provide further details. Zelensky also warns that Ukrainian officials now have ""information that enemy sabotage groups have entered Kyiv"". The president did not elaborate on what those groups might be. More on the situation at Chernobyl tonight: White House press secretary Jen Psaki just told reporters at her daily briefing that there are reports Russian soldiers are holding the staff of the Ukrainian nuclear site hostage. ""We are outraged by credible reports that Russian soldiers are currently holding the staff of the Chernobyl facilities hostage,"" she said. ""This unlawful and dangerous hostage-taking, which could upend the routine civil service efforts required to maintain and protect the nuclear waste facilities, is obviously incredibly alarming and gravely concerning. ""We condemn it and we request their release."" Read more on this here. British Prime Minister Boris Johnson told his government on Thursday evening that Ukrainian soldiers have been putting up a fight, tweets the BBC's political correspondent Iain Watson.

Russian forces have taken control of Chernobyl, site of the 1986 nuclear disaster and a place that remains radioactive to this day - prompting significant concern from international nuclear watchdogs. Prof Claire Corkhill, nuclear materials expert at Sheffield University, told the BBC about the dangers of military clashes taking place near the site. âThis is not a place to have ammunition flying around,"" she said. The Chernobyl site contains several nuclear waste containment facilities - including the ânew safe confinementâ - the protective dome that covers the reactor that was so badly damaged by the infamous 1986 explosion. âThese buildings are designed to keep radioactive materials inside, but theyâre not necessarily armoured; theyâre not designed to operate in a war zone,â she said. Prof Corkhill said that although piercing one of these structures  wouldnât necessarily cause a repeat of the Chernobyl disaster - where plumes of radioactive material dispersed across Europe - it could âset us back 30 years in terms of the work that has been done clearing up the siteâ. It could release and disperse radioactive material in the local area, she said. Chris MorrisBBC Reality Check The Nord Stream 2 pipeline that would bring gas to Germany has shuttered amid the latest fighting There was plenty of criticism that Western sanctions in the days leading up to this invasion did not go far enough, fast enough. These new measures will hit the Russian economy much harder. But there are still potential gaps. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson said sanctions against major Russian banks include one of the largest state banks, VTB, which will have all its assets frozen. But another major bank, Sberbank, was not mentioned. And the Ukrainian government wanted more â in particular moves to disconnect Russia from the international payment system known as Swift, which thousands of banks use to exchange information. The US and the UK are in favour of such a move, but some European countries fear it could damage their own banks. Suspending Russia from Swift is still under consideration, but the hesitation is a reminder that in a globalised world all sanctions tend to have an impact on the countries imposing them as well. And the real trouble with sanctions is that they donât work quickly. They do increase pressure, and they can do damage. But the international community is not trying to damage the Russian economy just for the sake of doing so. It wants economic pressure to force a change in Putinâs political and military calculations. Meanwhile, the invasion of Ukraine continues. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has just signed a decree ordering a general mobilisation. All Ukrainians who can carry arms have been urged to defend their homeland. The country's conscripts and reservists are also being called up, according to the decree, which is to be in effect for 90 days. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says 137 Ukrainian citizens - both soldiers and civilians - died on Thursday, the first day of a massive Russian military assault. Gordon CoreraSecurity correspondent, BBC News The head of Britain's MI6 has tweeted about intelligence on Ukraine. âUS and UK
intelligence communities uncovered Putinâs plans for Ukraine. We exposed his
attempts to engineer âfalse flagâ, fake attacks to justify his invasion. We
revealed his plans to assassinate Ukrainian leaders and senior officials,â
Richard Moore, also known as ""C"", said in a tweet. âThis attack was long
planned, unprovoked, cruel aggression. No amount of Russian disinformation will
now disguise that fact from the international community,"" wrote the Secret Intelligence Service chief. US and UK intelligence seem to have had an unusual and highly
accurate level of insight into Putinâs plans and strategy. The unprecedented
publicising of some of that intelligence has had tactical success in partly disrupting Putinâs plans - including for provocations and false flags. It may have also helped draw Western countries closer together. But even this
level of insight couldnât provide a way of stopping or deterring him. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Long queues have been seen at bus and train station in the capital Kyiv, as people have been desperately trying to go western regions of Ukraine All Ukrainian men aged between 18 to 60 are now banned from leaving the country, Ukraine's state border guard service (DPSA) says. It adds the measure is aimed at ""guaranteeing Ukraine's defence and the organisation of timely mobilisation"". The temporary ban will remain in force for the duration of martial law declared on Thursday morning. Steve RosenbergBBC Moscow Correspondent I think Vladimir Putin is fuelled by resentment at how the Cold War ended, with the West declaring victory and Russia losing power, influence and territory. I think he's also motivated by an almost semi-religious belief that Ukraine must be with Russia, must be in Russia's orbit, and Russia as a great power has the right to its own sphere of influence. I also think he has disdain for the West and Western leaders, whom he deems weak and disunited. What can the West do about this? Itâs very difficult to say. I think the Kremlin would've factored in sanctions. The Kremlin will know that the US will not put boots on the ground in Ukraine. The West does not want a war with Russia and Russia knows that. But I would say this. If youâve been in power for 22 years, as Putin has, you start to feel invincible, you start to think you canât put a foot wrong, that youâre Teflon. And that's when mistakes start to creep in. Just from speaking to people on the streets and witnessing the strength of feeling against this offensive, I wonder whether this Russian invasion will turn out to be Putin's fatal error. Countless city residents are hunkered in subways to avoid potential fighting Countless Kyiv residents are sleeping in underground metro stations as midnight approaches in Ukraine. The people - some of whom have brought their pets, extension cords and even air mattresses - are mostly calm, according to one evacuee. The place is ""not too crowded, most people are scrolling their phones, trying to catch the latest news"", says Oksana Potapova. ""We seem settled enough to spend the night here,"" she wrote on Facebook. ""And given the news about heavy fighting near Kyiv, the takeover of Chernobyl power plant, and forecasts of possible attacks on Kyiv, it seems like a good decision."" Paul AdamsBBC diplomatic correspondent A new iron curtain is falling
across Europe. Thatâs what this countryâs
beleaguered president, Volodymyr Zelensky, said in his most recent televised
statement. The echoes of Winston
Churchillâs famous 1946 speech in Fulton, Missouri were powerful. âFrom Stettin in the Baltic to Trieste in the
Adriatic, an iron curtain has descended across the continent,â Churchill told
his audience back then. Todayâs iron curtain has moved eastwards,
meandering from the Gulf of Finland, around Belarus and along Ukraineâs eastern
border and on down to the Black Sea. That, Zelensky says, is where it should stay, with
Ukraine firmly on the west. But that conviction feels like a fragile,
disappearing dream tonight, as Russian armour cuts deep into Ukrainian
territory, with the prospect of worse to come. With savage ferocity, Vladimir Putin has reached
out, grabbed Ukraine by the scruff of the neck and is trying, by force of arms,
to drag this hopeful nation back across the fence. Night has fallen and a curfew is in effect in Kyiv after the first full day of Russia's invasion of Ukraine. If you're just joining us, or catching up on events, here's what's been going on:  If you want more detail, you can read our guide to the conflict, and how it has unfolded today, byclicking here. Ilya BarabanovBBC Russian Service, Kyiv Smoke rises in the background as people walk down a street near the airfield All day long the Russian troops have been trying to take over an airfield at Hostomel, on the northern outskirts of the Ukrainian capital. This airfield is of strategic importance: if captured it could become a springboard for the Russian army into Kyiv. Judging from verified videos, at least two Russian helicopters were shot down over it. Journalists from CNN filmed a group of Russian paratroopers landing there while the Bellingcat investigative website said it had intelligence that 18 war planes with reinforcements were heading towards it from Russia. Later in the evening it became clear that a heavy battle for Hostomel was raging and Ukrainian forces were using both airstrikes and artillery. By 11pm Kyiv time (21:00 GMT) an official statement was released, saying that the airfield was back in the Ukrainian hands. A protester is detained in Saint Petersburg More than 1,700 people have been arrested during anti-war protests across dozens of cities in Russia, an independent monitor reports. More than 900 were arrested in Moscow and over 400 in Saint Petersburg, according to OVD-Info, which tracks arrests at opposition rallies. Thousands gathered near Pushkin Square in central Moscow, while up to 1,000 people gathered in the former imperial capital Saint Petersburg, the AFP news agency reports. Many held Ukrainian flags in Moscow ""No to war"" was spray-painted on the front gate of the Russian parliament's lower house. ""I am in shock. My relatives and loved ones live in Ukraine,"" Anastasia Nestulya, 23, told AFP in Moscow. ""What can I tell them over the phone? You hang in there?"" Navalny (standing) while on trial from prison Jailed Russian opposition leader Alexei Navalny - on trial in a Moscow prison -  has accused Vladimir Putin of using the invasion of Ukraine to cover up Russian corruption. In a video published by independent news outlet Dozhd, Navalny is heard expressing his opposition to the invasion of Ukraine. Wearing a prison uniform, he says it would lead to a ""huge number of victims, destroyed futures and the continuation of this line of impoverishment of the citizens of Russia"". This war between Russia and Ukraine was unleashed to cover up the theft from Russian citizens and divert their attention from problems that exist inside the country. Alexei Navalny Navalny has been jailed for over a year on old fraud charges, after surviving a poison attack, which he and the West say was carried out by the Kremlin. He is being tried inside the maximum security prison on new charges that could see his imprisonment extended by a decade. Vladimir Putin has spoken by phone to French President Emmanuel Macron and given him an ""exhaustive"" explanation of the reasons for
Russia's actions in Ukraine, the Kremlin says. Macron requested the call and they agreed to stay in contact, the Kremlin says. In France, the Elysee Palace says Macron spoke first to Ukraine's President Zelensky. He then spoke to President Putin and demanded an end to military operations and warned of massive sanctions. The French president has attempted to avert a Russian invasion in recent weeks, including holding talks
with Putin in the Kremlin. Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva The UN Refugee Agency warned today of a rapidly deteriorating situation in Ukraine as people flee their homes looking for safety. UN High Commissioner for Refugees, Filippo Grandi, warned ""the humanitarian consequences on civilian populations will be devastating. There are no winners in war but countless lives will be torn apart"". The refugee agency is calling on Ukraineâs neighbours to keep their borders open to those fleeing and says it stands ready to ""support efforts by all to respond to any situation of forced displacement"". Meanwhile, the president of the International Committee of the Red Cross, Peter Maurer, called on those fighting to respect international law, and to ensure civilians were protected. The UN had already issued a record appeal for funding in 2022 to relieve crises in Syria, Yemen, Afghanistan, and the drought-ridden Sahel region in Africa. A further major conflict and refugee crisis in the middle of Europe could stretch its resources well beyond their limits. Â© 2025 BBC.

Six Russian government websites are currently down, according to the Kyiv Independent. That list reportedly includes the official sites of the Kremlin and Russia's media regulatory agency. The outlet attributed its reporting to sources at Ukraine's state telecommunications agency. State TV channels have also been âhacked to play Ukrainian songs"", it says. The Anonymous hacking collective has taken credit for the attacks, but this has not been independently confirmed. As Ukrainians settle in for another long night amid Russia's invasion, Western allies have pledged to send additional weapons to support Ukraine's defence. On Saturday: The Ukrainian ambassador to the US, Oksana Markarova, has been giving daily press briefings in Washington and speaking to US media. ""We are preparing for this night, but as the two nights, three nights before, we are very resolute to defend our country,"" she told CNN. The ambassador relayed that there are reports of heavy assaults in western Kyiv, accusing Russians of attacking civilian targets ""It's horrifying,"" she said, but added that ""the spirit in Ukraine is very strong"" and that ordinary Ukrainians ""are all defending our home"". The US is calling the decision of Western allies to disconnect Russian banks from the Swift messaging system ""the Iran model"". Iran was cut off from Swift in 2012 as part of sanctions over its nuclear programme, though many of its banks have since reconnected to the system. Russian banks cut off from Swift ""will now need
     to use the telephone or a fax machine,"" a senior White House official said. ""In all likelihood, most banks
     around the world will simply stop transactions all together with Russian banksâ. Friday's decision on Swift will be applied to ""selected"" but not all Russian banks, and the White House said the European Union will finalise the list. âOnly Putin can decide how much more cost he is
     willing to bear,"" the US said. ""Nobody thought this is how we would spend our weekend,"" a teacher in the city of Dnipro, in eastern Ukraine, told our correspondent Sarah Rainsford earlier today. This video can not be played WATCH: In Dnipro, civilians make petrol bombs in a park Konul KhalilovaBBC Azerbaijan Editor Azerbaijan's state oil company, SOCAR, has confirmed to the BBC that it will provide Ukraine's firefighting and ambulance services with free
petrol for the duration of the conflict. The move follows a phone call between Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky and Azeri President Ilham Aliyev. Aliyev also pledged to provide Ukraine with deliveries of medicines and medical equipment. The Russian invasion of Ukraine has put the Azeri leader in a difficult position. He is wary of Russia and signed an agreement of
alliance with President Vladimir Putin on the day when latter recognised separatist regions of Ukraine last week. But he also has close ties with the EU and Turkey, both of which have condemned Russia's invasion. Aliyev faced internally criticism for his agreement with Putin and for not openly expressing his support to Ukraine. Prior to the invasion, Aliyev also signed an agreement with the EU to increase gas supplies to the bloc. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Stephen MulveyBBC News Three years ago, he was a comedian with no political experience. Today, he is leading his country's defence against an invasion and has emerged as an unlikely war leader. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has surprised some of his toughest critics by rallying the nation with his addresses and video selfies. He has given voice to Ukrainian anger and defiance of Russian aggression. The 44-year-old law graduate, whose candidacy for president was initially seen by some as a joke, has appeared dignified and resolute in the face of crisis. Each of his public broadcasts have struck the right note for Ukrainians who need a commander-in-chief to lead them through this upheaval. Read more of our profile. Among the range of measures that European Commission president Ursula von der Leyen announced was the freezing of transactions of Russia's central bank -  this will effectively stop Putin from using his war chest, she says. Cutting banks off will stop them from conducting most of their financial transactions worldwide and effectively block Russian exports and imports. Second, we will stop Putin from using his war chest. We will paralyse the assets of Russiaâs central bank. This will freeze its transactions. And it will make it impossible for the Central Bank to liquidate its assets. Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission The EU will also work towards prohibiting Russian oligarchs from using their financial assets on European markets.  All of these measures will significantly harm Putinâs ability to finance his war. They will have an eroding impact on the economy. Putin embarked on a path aiming to destroy Ukraine, but what he is also doing, in fact, is destroying the future of his own country. Ursula von der Leyen, President of the European Commission Tens of thousands of people have been leaving Ukraine in search of safety.

The new financial measures just announced by the EU, US, UK, France, Germany and others targeting Russia will be complemented by a transatlantic task force, according to the joint statement. That effort ""will ensure the effective implementation of our financial sanctions"" by identifying and freezing the assets of sanctioned individuals and organisations, they say. The group says it will also work with other governments to ""deny these individuals the ability to hide their assets in jurisdictions across the world"". Western countries have already imposed sanctions on several major Russian institutions, officials and elites, including President Vladimir Putin himself. ""We stand with the Ukrainian people in this dark hour,"" the statement concludes. Lyse DoucetChief International Correspondent, reporting from Kyiv Tonight, at this midnight hour, stark warnings sound of an imminent onslaught against the heart of Kyiv. âIn 30-60 mins #Kyiv will be under attack never seen before. #Russia will hit us with all they have,â tweeted MP Lesia Vasylenko. Air-raid sirens have pierced the darkness, amplified by warnings in buildings and neighbourhoods for residents to immediately take to shelters. This is already a city where life has dropped underground, to basements, bomb shelters, and metro stations-turned-bunkers. A strict curfew is in force until 8am on Monday. Allow Twitter content?

Thereâs been a chilling quiet these last three days in the heart of Kyiv.  An eerie stillness on emptied streets has been shattered by occasional crackles of gunfire, a thud of artillery and a thunder clap when missiles land in the distance, on the edges of a beleaguered capital. A Russian invasion, now at the end of its third day, has seemed to stall on the edges of the city in the midst of concerted Ukrainian resistance â soldiers guarding city gates, civilians taking up arms, even taunting Russian soldiers as they advance in their tanks and armoured vehicles. Reports from Moscow in recent hours spoke of orders to advance on the city âfrom all directions.â In the dead of a Kyiv night, thereâs an ominous sense that the battle for this city is about to be unleashed. The Western allies will also limit the ability of wealthy Russians to buy citizenship in other countries. ""We commit to acting against the people and entities who facilitate the war in Ukraine and the harmful activities of the Russian government,"" says the statement. ""Specifically, we commit to taking measures to limit the sale of citizenshipâso called golden passportsâthat let wealthy Russians connected to the Russian government become citizens of our countries and gain access to our financial systems."" The Swift messaging system is not the only area targeted in the joint statement just released. Western allies say they will also ""commit to imposing restrictive measures that will prevent the Russian Central Bank from deploying its international reserves in ways that undermine the impact of our sanctions"". The EU, France, Germany, Italy, the United Kingdom, Canada, and the United States have just released a co-ordinated statement condemning the Russian invasion. ""As Russian forces unleash their assault on Kyiv and other Ukrainian cities, we are resolved to continue imposing costs on Russia that will further isolate Russia from the international financial system and our economies,"" they say. Measures to be implemented in the coming days include removing ""selected Russian banks from the Swift messaging system"". ""This will ensure that these banks are disconnected from the international financial system and harm their ability to operate globally."" Swift is the global financial artery that allows the smooth and rapid transfer of money across borders. Abdujalil AbdurasulovReporting from Kyiv Thousands of people have been fleeing Kyiv in recent days. Earlier, at the main train station, hundreds of people gathered in a desperate attempt to flee Ukraine's capital. Even those who have cars struggled to leave the city because almost
all petrol stations in the region are closed. With the metro and buses not running, many people walked to the station - some for many
kilometres - and on the way, when sirens went off, they dashed to buildings with a basement or a bomb shelter. Olga Buzash was struggling to get on an evacuation train Evacuation trains were organised by the Ukrainian railway to take people to the west of the country and whenever one pulled up, a huge crowd quickly gathered trying to scramble aboard. Those who couldn't get a train before the curfew began at 17:00 local time will be spending the night in the station as a Russian attack looms. Paul AdamsBBC diplomatic correspondent, reporting from Kyiv Air raid sirens sounded a
short time ago. This time the warnings were alarmingly specific: incoming
missiles expected within minutes. Kyiv is bracing itself as never before. One MP told us that Russia âwill hit us with all they haveâ. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
