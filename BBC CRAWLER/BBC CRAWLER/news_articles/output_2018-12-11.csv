Paisley facing new luxury holiday questions,"Mr Paisley was recently suspended from the House of Commons for 30 days for ""serious misconduct"" DUP MP Ian Paisley was given a complimentary holiday at a luxury Maldives resort months after advocating on behalf of its government. BBC Spotlight obtained new evidence which suggested the visit was requested by the Maldivian government and facilitated by the resort owner, who had political links. The programme examined whether the MP should have declared the trip in 2016. He said he paid for part of the holiday and the rest was paid for by a friend. The North Antrim MP did not reveal the identity of this friend. He said the friend was unconnected with his work and has received no benefit as a result of his work. Ian Paisley in his own words 'Petition result is a miracle' - Paisley Profile: DUP MP Ian Paisley A DUP spokesman said: ""The party officers will want to consider these very serious matters being mindful of the high standards we require of elected representatives."" Mr Paisley was recently suspended from the House of Commons for 30 days for ""serious misconduct""for failing to declare two family holidays to Sri Lanka in 2013. Ian Paisley, his wife and his two sons received full-board five-night stay at the luxury resort in October and November 2016, eight months after he was part of a controversial parliamentary visit to the islands. Gavin Millar QC, an expert on parliamentary rules, said the Nolan principles on standards in public life placed an onus on Mr Paisley to be transparent about why he had not registered the trip to the Maldives. ""MPs should give reasons for their decisions and restrict information only when the wider public interest clearly demands,"" said Mr Millar. ""Now his decision in this case, his decision was not to register the benefit, after the trip in late 2016, and he has an obligation to give reasons for that decision. ""Unless he can come up with some wider public interest argument for not saying more, he should be saying significantly more about any considerations that are relevant to the motive of that source in paying that money."" Mr Paisley has been contacted by Spotlight about Mr Millar's comments but has not responded. In a statement to Spotlight on Tuesday, Mr Paisley said: ""I have responded in clear and categoric terms to your questions. ""For the record, the government of the Maldives did not organise or pay for my family vacation in 2016, which I do not intend to go into with you. I'm satisfied the vacation did not have to be recorded on the register."" Ian Paisley visited the Maldives in February 2016 with two other MPs from an All-Party Parliamentary Group. At the time, the Maldives government, headed by President Abdulla Yameen, was being criticised by organisations including the United Nations and the Commonwealth for human rights abuses. Mr Paisley, however, appeared to advocate on behalf of the regime, speaking out against economic sanctions. With the other two MPs, he also visited the prison where opposition leader Mohamed Nasheed had been held, and described the conditions as quite luxurious. BBC Spotlight reporter Lyndsey Telford travelled to the Maldives as part of her investigation Later that year Mr Paisley travelled to the Maldives again for a holiday with his wife and two children. Spotlight's evidence, including an image which appears to be from the resort's internal records provided to the programme by an anonymous source, suggests that full board and transfers were provided complimentarily at the request of Mr Yameen's government and facilitated by the resort owner, Hussain Hilmy. Mr Hilmy is a former minister in the Maldives government and has held a number of other important public posts. Gavin Millar QC said that if, as Spotlight's documentary evidence suggests, the benefit was requested by the government and facilitated by Mr Hilmy, Mr Paisley should not have accepted it. ""But having accepted it, he certainly should have registered it undoubtedly. ""There are very strict rules about lobbying and creating an interest for yourself that may be perceived as lobbying. The moment you know these facts, that are disclosed in this document, the perception is that this is a reward for him having advocated for the Maldives government."" Ian Paisley has denied that the trip was connected with the government of the Maldives. Last week, Ian Paisley told Spotlight that he had discussed the holiday in the Maldives with the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards Kathryn Stone during her investigation into his Sri Lanka holidays. Mr Paisley claimed that as a consequence of that conversation, he had satisfied himself he did not need to register the holiday. Ian Paisley told Spotlight he had evidence which ""categorically disproves that the trip was connected to the government"" After Spotlight contacted the commissioner's office, Mr Paisley got in touch with Spotlight again to clarify that he had not spoken to the commissioner as he had claimed. He said he had in fact spoken to the parliamentary registrar who administers the register of members' interests. Mr Millar QC said the registrar's role was limited. ""The one thing they can give you as an MP is a clear account of what the rules require and what they don't require,"" eh said. ""But I understand that is as far as they will go. They will not give a licence to an MP not to declare in a particular situation nor will they say you must declare in a particular situation. The Maldives is a republic that lies south-west of the Indian sub-continent. It is made up of a chain of nearly 1,200 islands, most of them uninhabited. Its political history has been unsettled since the electoral defeat of long-serving President Maumoon Abdul Gayoom in 2008. Read more here. ""That's not how the code works. The way the code works is that it is ultimately always a matter for the MP."" Ian Paisley also told Spotlight he had evidence which, he said, ""categorically disproves that the trip was connected to the government"". Two emails, which he had arranged from contacts linked to the regime and the resort. The first was from Ahmed Shiaan, who was the Maldivian Ambassador to the UK at the time of the visit. He said the holiday had not been arranged by the Embassy or paid for by the government of the Maldives. Ian Paisley also sent Spotlight an email from the resort's commercial operating officer, Andrew Ashmore, who said invoices for the stay had been settled and paid for privately although he could not say by whom. Political rivals have been quick to criticise Mr Paisley. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Sinn FÃ©in has written to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards asking her to investigate the allegations. North Antrim MLA Philip McGuigan said there are ""serious questions to answer"" about Mr Paisley's relation with the government of the Maldives. Alliance leader Naomi Long said Mr Paisley had left himself open to criticism by not revealing his friend's identity. ""If this wasn't related to parliamentary duties the easiest way to clarify that is by saying who gave the gift and why,"" she told BBC's Good Morning Ulster programme. SDLP leader Colum Eastwood went further, calling for the North Antrim MP to resign. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""It really is time for Ian Paisley to resign,"" tweeted Mr Eastwood. ""If he doesn't, then the onus is on Arlene Foster to remove him from the DUP."" Mr Eastwood later tweeted: ""I've written to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards asking her to investigate Spotlight's allegations on Ian Paisley."" TUV leader Jim Allister said Mr Paisley now should ""refer himself to the Parliamentary Standards Commissioner, so that a considered verdict can be delivered"". The UUP leader, Robin Swann, called on the commissioner to launch an investigation ""urgently"". When the Daily Telegraph published revelations about his holidays to Sri Lanka in 2017, Mr Paisley initially said that the articles were ""devoid of logic"" and threatened legal action. He also referred himself to the Parliamentary Commissioner for Standards. The Commissioner, Kathryn Stone, found that Mr Paisley had failed to properly declare two holidays and engaged in paid advocacy for the Sri Lankan government. Her findings were supported by parliament which suspended Mr Paisley from the House of Commons for 30 days. However, a petition to trigger a by-election in his North Antrim constituency fell short by 444 votes, an outcome described by Mr Paisley as a ""miracle"". On his return to the House of Commons following his suspension, he said: ""A smaller man than me would have crumbled."" Mr Paisley has been MP for North Antrim since 2010, succeeding his father Ian Paisley, a former first minister of Northern Ireland and Democratic Unionist leader, who had held the seat since 1970.

ÃÂ£8 per day for broadband failure,"Many customers who experience fixed broadband or landline loss will soon automatically receive compensation. The Â£8-per-day deal follows a new agreement between Openreach and five of the UK's internet service providers. It will apply only when the fault takes longer than two days to fix. If an engineer does not arrive on schedule, or cancels within 24 hours, the compensation will be Â£25. There will also be Â£5-per-day offered for new services not starting on time. BT, Sky, TalkTalk, Virgin Media and Zen Internet have all agreed to the plan, which is not compulsory for the industry. Plusnet and EE have also previously suggested that they will sign up. The deal follows industry watchdog Ofcom releasing details of its voluntary automatic compensation code of practice in November 2017, which set the payout rate. It said at the time it would allow a 15-month implementation period for the new system meaning it should be ready in early 2019. Openreach said it would pay compensation even when others prevented it from accessing its network - if, for example, a vehicle is parked in front of a cabinet or it is unable to access a pole on private land. But it said it would not pay in  the event of ""measures beyond reasonable control"", such as flooding. Internet speed guarantees 'must be realistic' Number of mobile calls drops for first time UK broadband speeds leap ahead, according to Ofcom However, the internet service providers who have signed up may still be obliged to pay in those cases, said journalist and IT consultant Mark Jackson,writing on the website ISPreview,external. ""Openreach's steadfast position not to pay out during 'force majeure-type events' has caused some irritation, particularly while Ofcom continues to insist that retail ISPs will have to cover the cost of that themselves,"" he wrote. Mr Jackson also noted that most faults are fixed within two days, meaning that compensation will not apply. Both home and small and medium business customers will be eligible. Openreach said in a statement that it has offered compensation for broadband failures since 2008. ""We have fully supported Ofcom's voluntary code of practice since its inception, and are pleased to have reached an agreement with those communication providers intending to offer automatic compensation,"" it said. A spokesman for the regulator said: ""We're pleased this agreement has been reached, following our intervention to secure automatic compensation for customers facing problems such as delays and missed appointments.""

Trump in Oval Office scrap with Democrats,"This video can not be played Testy exchanges between Trump, Pelosi and Schumer in the Oval Office US President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened a government shutdown over funding for his proposed border wall in a budget row with top Democrats. During a heated exchange with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, Mr Trump said he would be ""proud"" to shut down the government over border security. If lawmakers cannot agree on a federal budget, funding for some departments will run out at the end of next week. Mr Trump has asked to include $5bn (Â£4bn) in the deal for border security. But Senator Schumer and Congresswoman Pelosi said they had agreed to extend funding for the Department of Homeland Security at current levels of $1.3bn (Â£1bn) until 30 September 2019. Mr Trump and the Democratic leadership often interrupted each other during the meeting Mr Trump opened the Oval Office meeting calling it a ""great honour"" to have Mr Schumer and Mrs Pelosi present, in their first meeting since Democrats took control of the House of Representatives in the November mid-term elections. But the meeting soon turned contentious as Mrs Pelosi and Mr Schumer argued that the Republican-controlled Congress could pass legislation before funding for some agencies was set to expire on 21 December. The president contended that it could only pass if it met his demands for more funding for his proposed border wall along the US southern border. Why does the US government shut down? ""If we don't get what we want, one way or the other, whether it's through you, through military, through anything you want to call, I will shut down the government,"" Mr Trump said. ""And I am proud to shut down the government for border security. I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down."" Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC Washington Donald Trump opened his press event with Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer with a feel-good embrace of bipartisanship. It didn't last long. The two Democrats and the president sparred over funding for the Mr Trump's proposed border wall. It seemed for a moment as though they might agree on funding for ""border security"" - but that linguistic pirouette disappeared beneath an onslaught of acrimony. The president wants his wall funding. He campaigned on it. He promised it. And even though Mexico isn't going to pay for it, he wants it now. Democrats, on the other hand, are loath to give him this victory. What's more, they're intent on having the blame for any government shutdown directed solely at the president. In the end Mr Trump gave the Democrats what they wanted. He said he would shut down the government if ""we don't get what we want"". He would be ""proud"" to do it. Democrats will try to make the president regret those words. Mr Trump, on the other hand, thinks the public - or at least his base - is with him in this fight. If neither side blinks, we'll know who is right in a few weeks. In an official readout following the meeting, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the Democrats have ""made clear they would rather keep the border open than the government open"". After the meeting, Democrat Chuck Schumer condemned Mr Trump's ""temper tantrum"" in the White House Oval Office. Nancy Pelosi, who is expected to become Speaker of the House when Democrats take over the chamber next month, mocked Mr Trump at a later meeting with colleagues on Capitol Hill. ""I was trying to be the mom,"" she said, sources told US media. ""It goes to show you: you get into a tinkle contest with a skunk, you get tinkle all over you."" She reportedly added that the president's insistence on a wall was ""a manhood thing"". Hours before the meeting, Mr Trump tweeted that ""the Military will build the remaining sections of the Wall"". But a defence department said later: ""To date, there is no plan to build sections of the wall."" This video can not be played Government workers on what happens during a shutdown If the budget stalemate cannot be resolved, funding for about a quarter of government departments, including justice, agriculture and homeland security, will run out on 21 December. The remaining parts of the federal government, including the defence department, have been funded until 2019. Hundreds of thousands of government employees would be forced to stay home in the event of a shutdown.

Grenfell hearings 'may slip back to 2020',"The second phase of the Grenfell Tower inquiry will not start until autumn 2019 at the earliest. A barrister for one of the residents, Rajiv Menon QC, told the inquiry the hearings may even slip to 2020. Inquiry chairman Sir Martin Moore-Bick will confirm the new timetable on Wednesday as the first phase concludes. The length of time will allow lawyers to digest a vast amount of evidence, some of which will be passed to a coroner. A number of inquests into the deaths at the tower are expected to conclude next year. How the tragedy unfolded at Grenfell Tower 'Faulty connection started Grenfell blaze' Grenfell Inquiry: What is happening? The hearings have so far been concentrating solely on the events of the night of 14 June 2017 in which 72 people died. The next phase will examine the wider causes, including the use of cladding blamed for helping the fire spread. The first phase heard detailed evidence that the plastic material added to the building and the redesign of its windows both allowed the flames to spread rapidly. Phase two will examine why those changes were made as part of the Grenfell refurbishment. Victims' barristers also want the inquiry chairman to make early findings to improve the safety of other residential tower blocks. Meanwhile, Anne Studd QC, representing the Mayor of London, has reiterated concerns about the inquiry continuing to be held in central London. On Tuesday she said phase two should be held closer to the tower in North Kensington, west London, for the ""convenience of core participants with competing daily commitments in their locality"". A criminal investigation into the fire is continuing.

He said his son was ""very popular"" and would ""do anything for anyone"".

Putin's Stasi spy ID found in Germany,"Vladimir Putin was 33 when he received this Stasi ID card A Stasi ID pass used by Vladimir Putin when he was a Soviet spy in former East Germany has been found in the Stasi secret police archive in Dresden. The Russian president has expressed pride in his record as a communist KGB officer in Dresden in the 1980s. His Stasi pass was found during research into the close co-operation between the KGB and Stasi. Mr Putin, then a KGB major, got it in 1985. It got him into Stasi facilities, but he may not have spied for them. In a statement on Tuesday, the Stasi Records Agency (BStU) said that Mr Putin ""received the pass so that he could carry out his KGB work in co-operation with the Stasi"". Stasi was actually the nickname for East German Ministry of State Security (MfS) agents. It was notorious for its meticulous surveillance of ordinary citizens, many of whom were pressed into spying on each other. ""Current research gives no indication that Vladimir Putin worked for the MfS,"" the BStU statement said. Vladimir Putin's formative German years Vladimir Putin: Russia's action man president In pictures: Secret lives of the Stasi The stamps are proof of Mr Putin's years co-operating with the Stasi in Dresden Mr Putin signed himself ""Wladimir Putin"" using German spelling Mr Putin, born in Leningrad (now St Petersburg), was posted to East Germany in 1985, aged 33. His two daughters were born during that posting. He is now 66. Mr Putin was a KGB officer in Dresden up to and including December 1989, when the communist East German regime collapsed amid mass pro-democracy protests. His Stasi pass was renewed every three months, as shown by the stamps on it. It is not clear why he left the pass in the Stasi files in Dresden. This building was the KGB's headquarters in Dresden during the Cold War He witnessed protesters occupying the Dresden Stasi headquarters, while communist security forces came close to opening fire on them, on 5 December 1989. Jubilant East Berliners had already breached the Berlin Wall in November. Mr Putin was fluent in German at the time and has said he personally calmed the Dresden crowd when they surrounded the KGB building there, warning them that it was Soviet territory. During his KGB service in Dresden Mr Putin was promoted to the rank of lieutenant colonel. In 1989 he was awarded a bronze medal by communist East Germany - officially the German Democratic Republic (GDR) - ""for faithful service to the National People's Army"",the Kremlin website says.,external After returning to Russia, Mr Putin rose to become head of the Federal Security Service (FSB) - main successor to the KGB. He became Russian president in 2000. In June 2017Mr Putin revealed that his work in the KGB,externalhad involved ""illegal intelligence-gathering"". Speaking on Russian state TV, he said KGB spies were people with ""special qualities, special convictions and a special type of character"". A once top secret agreement between the KGB and Stasi, seen by the BBC, shows that the KGB had 30 liaison officers in East Germany who worked directly alongside the Stasi. Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov shrugged off the emergence of Mr Putin's old Stasi card. ""The KGB and the Stasi were partner intelligence agencies so you probably can't rule out an exchange of such identity cards,"" he said.

May: EU leaders want to help save deal,"Theresa May says there is a ""shared determination"" among EU leaders to solve the Irish border problem preventing MPs from backing her deal. She was speaking after meetings with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. The prime minister says there can be no EU withdrawal deal without a backstop plan for the Irish border. But she said she was seeking guarantees that it would be ""only temporary"" to address the concerns of her own MPs. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn labelled Mrs May the ""runaway prime minister"" and said her trip was a ""waste of time and public money"". The prime minister is now in Brussels for meetings with top EU officials Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker, Kuenssberg: Is confidence vote looming? Reality Check: Does Brussels blink in negotiations? Brexitcast - Emergency edition after vote called off European media see few options in Brexit poker Mr Tusk, President of the European Council, tweeted: ""Long and frank discussion with PM Theresa May ahead of Brexit summit. Clear that EU27 wants to help. The question is how."" Angela Merkel said the deal could not be re-negotiated but she was still optimistic a solution to the Irish border issue could be found. Critics object to the backstop - a temporary customs arrangement designed to prevent the need for checkpoints at the Irish border if a long-term solution that avoids them cannot be agreed - because it imposes different regulations in Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. They also object to the fact that under the terms of the withdrawal agreement, the UK can not exit the backstop without the EU agreeing. After aborting Tuesday's planned vote on the deal, Mrs May is believed to be considering how to give the UK Parliament a vote on whether to enter the backstop - and an annual vote on whether the country should remain in it. Ministers have suggested this could be done in an ""addendum"" to the withdrawal agreement, without changing the main text of it. This video can not be played May I get out? PM's car door gets stuck Speaking in Brussels, Mrs May said a backstop was ""a necessary guarantee for the people of Northern Ireland"". ""Whatever relationship you want with Europe in the future, there's no deal available that doesn't have a backstop within it. ""But we don't want the backstop to be used and if it is, we want to be certain that it is only temporary. And it is those assurances that I will be seeking from fellow leaders over the coming days."" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, who will welcome Mrs May to Dublin on Wednesday, said he hoped to reassure the UK without changing the fundamental substance of the withdrawal deal, including the backstop. ""Our approach is that we have a deal on the table,"" he told the Irish Parliament. ""Our objective is to get the deal ratified by the House of Commons.

It is not clear if any changes obtained would be enough to win over Conservative Brexiteers and the Democratic Unionist Party, whose votes Mrs May relies on to win key votes in the Commons, who have called for the entire backstop plan to be dropped. Theresa May's first meeting was with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte The prime minister's U-turn sparked anger among MPs on all sides, who had spent three days debating the deal and had been promised the final say on it on Tuesday.

Corbyn urged to call no-confidence vote Backstop changes 'not possible' - Irish PM Sturgeon: Brexit vote delay is 'cowardice' Speaking during an emergency debate in the Commons on the government's handling of the aborted Brexit vote, Mr Corbyn said such reports were ""disturbing"" and urged Mrs May to ""admit her deal is dead"". ""What is she doing in Europe? This runaway prime minister is not even seeking to negotiate. She confirmed she is only seeking reassurances. Our prime minister is traipsing round the continent in pursuit of warm words."" Labour late won a non-binding vote criticising the government's handling of the issue by 299 to zero after Conservative MPs chose not to take part. Meanwhile, more backbench Tory MPs are considering submitting letters of no confidence in Theresa May in the hope of toppling her and forcing a Tory leadership contest. If she was no longer Conservative Party leader she would also be expected to step down as prime minister.

The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said senior Tories were sounding ""more confident"" that the threshold had been reached. Allow Twitter content?

Separately, Labour is coming under pressure from the SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party to call a vote of no confidence among all MPs to try and bring down Theresa May's government - something that can, effectively, only be done by the main opposition party. The Labour leader told MPs he had no confidence in the government but his party needed ""to do the appropriate thing at the appropriate time"" if it was to succeed in bringing it down. Even old hands in Westminster are struggling to make sense of what is going on By BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley Parliament feels like a confused and sometimes angry place today. As Theresa May fights for further assurances on the backstop, many are unconvinced. Even among Conservatives loyal to her, the mood is bleak. One Tory MP who supported the PM's deal told me they didn't have a clue what was happening now. ""We're rewriting the pantomime,"" they added.  Another pondered: ""The Conservatives made this muddle - who is going to fix it?"" One minister concluded things were at ""breaking point"". Brexiteers speak openly of exasperation. One source, who has been highly critical of the plan but not the PM, told me many were changing their minds now; Mrs May is now seen as the problem.  It's not the first time we've heard such claims - and in the past they haven't materialised. But this person said a number of Brexit backers who have resisted pressure to send in letters calling for a vote of no confidence in the PM as Tory leader have now changed their minds.

Pressure mounting on May from Tory MPs,"Tory Brexiteers are increasingly confident they have enough support to trigger a no-confidence vote in Theresa May as party leader. If 48 Conservative MPs submit letters to say they no longer support her, a leadership challenge will be launched. There is no confirmation but sources, including a cabinet minister, have said they believe 48 letters have been sent. The BBC has also been told the senior backbencher who receives the letters has asked to see the PM on Wednesday. However Sir Graham Brady, who chairs the backbench 1922 committee, would make no comment. Downing Street sources are playing down an imminent move and say they have had no contact from him. Kuenssberg: Is PM about to face a confidence vote? Who has written no confidence letters? Guide: Rules for any challenge to Theresa May The backbench challenge to Mrs May as Conservative leader has been led by those unhappy at the Brexit deal she negotiated, which they argue would keep the UK closely tied to the EU in the long term. Some Tories who voted Remain in the referendum are unhappy too. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Separately, many opposition MPs haveurged Labour leader Jeremy Corbynto call for a Commons vote of no confidence in the government, although he has so far resisted. If such a vote succeeded, it wouldstart the clock on a 14-day deadline to find a successor governmentwhich could command confidence. Otherwise, the Queen would have to dissolve Parliament. Mrs May spent Tuesday meeting EU leaders and officials in The Hague, Berlin and Brussels in efforts to salvage her deal, which is widely opposed by MPs of all parties who voted both Leave and Remain in the EU referendum. Her decision to delay voting on the terms of the UK's withdrawal from the EU, which had been due to take place on Tuesday, has caused anger across the Commons. Theresa May met German Chancellor Angela Merkel in Berlin on Monday So far, 27 Tory MPs have publicly stated they have sent letters saying they have lost confidence in their leader - but speculation has increased that the numbers have risen. Former environment secretary Owen Paterson was among the latest to call for Mrs May to go, saying she had failed to prepare for a no-deal Brexit, tried to bounce her ministers into supporting her and approached negotiations like a ""feeble and unworthy"" supplicant. ""These mistakes have eroded trust in the government, to the point where I and many others can no longer take the prime minister at her word,"" he wrote in his letter, . ""She has repeatedly said 'no deal is better than a bad deal', but it is clear her objective was to secure a deal at any cost."" But former cabinet minister Damian Green, who supports Mrs May, told BBC's Newsnight: ""If people have written letters to this degree... this is an act of monumental self-indulgence. ""People outside the Westminster bubble will be looking at this thinking 'we have got a prime minister doing really difficult negotiations at the sharp end of one of the most important decisions this country has taken in 50 years'. ""To undermine a prime minister at this stage seems to me to be wholly wrong."" Mrs May also held talks with European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Monday Asked on Tuesday whether she had been told the threshold of 48 letters had been reached, Mrs May replied: ""No, I have been here in Europe dealing with the issue I have promised Parliament I would be dealing with."" She is due to travel to Dublin laterafter hosting a weekly meeting of her cabinet and facing Prime Minister's Questions. The PM is then scheduled to attend a summit of European leaders on Thursday at which she is likely to press for changes to elements of her Brexit deal to try to get the support of Parliament. Speaking on Tuesday, she said there was a ""shared determination"" among EU leaders to solve the Irish border problem preventing MPs from backing her deal. European leaders have said they will not renegotiate the text of the withdrawal deal agreed last month, as demanded by many Tory MPs, but are prepared to clarify aspects of it. It is not clear when a contest - if there is one - might take place, but Sir Graham has said in the past it would not be delayed unduly if the threshold were met. This video can not be played How the Conservative Party handles a leadership challenge The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg said Monday was a possibility. If a confidence vote is triggered, all 315 Tory MPs will be entitled to take part in a secret ballot in which they will be asked if they still have confidence in the prime minister. If Mrs May wins the support of a majority of MPs - that is, 158 MPs - she would be entitled to carry on and, if she did, she could not be challenged for another year. If a majority of MPs do not support her, she would have to resign as Tory leader and would also be expected to stand down as prime minister. A leadership contest would then be held to succeed her which could take several weeks. Some commentators have suggested that, given the weakness of her political position, it would be difficult for Mrs May to stay on if more than 100 MPs voted against her. The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg I know, I know, I know. We have been here before, and on more than one occasion. But senior Eurosceptics are more sure than ever that they have enough support to trigger a vote of no confidence in the prime minister. That doesn't mean it is bound to happen. The last time they said so, and said so pretty publicly, their confidence was a mirage and the numbers did not emerge. It became evident to ardent Brexiteers that their communications between each other were not all genuine, and painfully so. Those who had told colleagues that they had submitted the letters, patently had not done so. What feels different now is that those who take this all extremely seriously, who had their hopes dashed the last time, are suggesting privately - not necessarily with glee - that they might have done it this time, and crucially if the list isn't long enough now, they have more MPs ready to join the calls.

"One dead, 10 wounded in Strasbourg attack","This video can not be played Pater Fritz describes hearing gunshots and attending to a victim of the Strasbourg shooting Hundreds of police officers are hunting a gunman after three people were killed and 12 others wounded in a shooting in the eastern French city of Strasbourg. The suspect, who is known to security services, escaped after exchanging fire with soldiers and armed police on Tuesday. He is believed to be injured. The shooting happened close to a popular Christmas market near one of the central squares, Place KlÃ©ber. France's counter-terrorism prosecutor has opened an investigation. There were reports on Wednesday morning that a police operation had been launched around the cathedral area in the city. The motive for the shooting remains unclear. ""He fought twice with our security forces,"" French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said. Armed police secure the area after the deadly shooting incident on Tuesday Confirming that three people had died, Mr Castaner said that border controls had been strengthened and security at all Christmas markets would be stepped up, with 350 security agents hunting for the gunman. He added that France had raised its security alert level to ""emergency attack"". Six of those reportedly injured on Tuesday were said to be in a serious condition, while six others suffered light injuries, police said. Police added that the 29-year-old suspect was born in Strasbourg and was already known to the security services as a possible terrorist threat. Police searched the narrow streets near the Christmas market in Strasbourg According to France's BFM TV the man had fled his flat in the Neudorf district of the city on Tuesday morning as it was being searched by police in connection with a robbery. Grenades were found during the search. Residents in Neudorf were urged to stay indoors following unconfirmed reports that the suspect had been tracked down and cornered by police in the area. The European Parliament, which is nearby, was placed on lockdown. The parliament's president, Antonio Tajani, tweeted to say it would ""not be intimidated by terrorist or criminal attacks"".

French President Emmanuel Macron, who had attended a crisis meeting with cabinet officials in Paris, later tweeted that the ""solidarity of the entire nation"" was with Strasbourg, the victims and their families. The attack unfolded at around 20:00 local time (19:00 GMT) close to Strasbourg's famed Christmas market, which attracts thousands of visitors at this time of year. Eyewitness Pater Fritz told the BBC he heard gunfire and found a person who had been shot, lying on a bridge. He said he tried to resuscitate him but the man died. ""There are no ambulance services able to enter the area, apparently,"" he said, adding: ""After 45 minutes we stopped the resuscitation [attempt], because a doctor told us on the phone that it was senseless."" Another eyewitness, who gave his name as Fatih, told AFP news agency that after the shots were fired there was ""pandemonium"" on the streets. ""People were running everywhere,"" he said. Local journalist Bruno Poussard wrote on Twitter that there had been a dozen shots fired on his street in the city centre - one or two to begin with, then in bursts. Emmanuel Foulon, a press officer for the European Parliament, wrote that there was ""panic"" in the centre following the sound of gunfire and that police with guns were running through the streets. A shopkeeper told BFM TV: ""There were gun shots and people running everywhere. It lasted about 10 minutes."" British MEP Richard Corbett tweeted that he was in a restaurant in the city and the doors had been locked. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Irish 'upping no-deal planning',"The Republic of Ireland needs to up its contingency plans for the potential of the UK leaving the EU without a deal, the Taoiseach (Irish prime minister) has said. It comes asa vote on Theresa May's Brexit plan was called off, so she could seek assurances from Brussels over the Irish border backstop. But the EU has insisted the deal is ""not up for renegotiation"". Mrs May will travel to Dublin on Wednesday to meet Leo Varadkar. PM meeting EU leaders in rescue bid Is the backstop an opportunity or a threat? Kuenssberg: Now what for Brexit? The prime minister has already been holding talks with other European leaders and EU officials in a bid to rescue her Brexit deal. Mrs May is expected to meet DUP leader Arlene Foster on Wednesday before heading to Dublin. The UK is due to leave the EU on 29 March 2019. The backstop is the insurance policy arrangement aimed at avoiding a return to a hard border - physical checkpoints or infrastructure - along the 310-mile (500-km) border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland after Brexit. The Irish government has said there can be no deal without it, and has received support from other EU leaders. Mrs Foster has said the Irish border backstop should be taken out of the EU withdrawal deal and put into the political declaration between the EU and UK, which is not legally binding and covers potential future relations.

It has faced a backlash from Labour and other opposition parties, and the DUP - which backs the government in a confidence-and-supply pact -  but says it will not back the deal unless there is ""radical surgery"" to amend its terms. Q&A: The Irish border backstop NI leaders react to Brexit vote delay If it took effect, it would see Northern Ireland only remain aligned with the EU single market in some areas, meaning new regulatory barriers between GB and NI. The UK would also not be able to leave the backstop without EU agreement. Mrs May is understood to be seeking legal guarantees that the UK will not be trapped in the Northern Ireland backstop plan indefinitely. On Tuesday, TÃ¡naiste (Irish deputy prime minister) Simon Coveney gave a paper to cabinet colleagues outlining the government's preparations for a no-deal outcome. Mr Varadkar said the government now needs to up its contingency planning to execution for a no-deal scenario in terms of recruitment of customs, veterinary and health officers at Irish ports. ""It means putting in place infrastructure at our ports and airports, in Dublin and Rosslare,"" he said. ""Firms who don't have action plans should develop action plans, and those who have action plans should begin to implement them."" Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald Sinn FÃ©in President Mary Lou McDonald said she had made it clear to Theresa May that it would be ""incumbent"" on the British government to hold a border poll, if the UK left the EU without a deal. Her party is one of four pro-remain parties in Northern Ireland backing the deal, and has urged the UK to ""bank the backstop"". But she put it to Mr Varadkar that it was ""time"" for the Irish government to articulate the same position as Sinn FÃ©in, in supporting a border poll, if no deal could be reached. ""The fact is uniting our country would end the need for a backstop."" But Mr Varadkar said he disagreed with her assessment, and that he would be working to give the UK ""assurances"", but never compromising on its commitments on the border. ""If I didn't know you better I would almost think you wanted a no-deal scenario... so you could stir up trouble,"" he said to Ms McDonald. ""By introducing demands for a border poll at this time, they are are disruptive and destructive to what we want to try and achieve."" He said the UK could still withdraw the threat of no deal by revoking Article 50 or extending it. This video can not be played Iain Duncan Smith : Irish PM 'playing a game' on backstop Former Conservative leader Iain Duncan Smith accused Mr Varadkar of ""playing a game"" with the backstop. He told BBC News that Mrs May should be telling the EU27 that the backstop is ""intolerable"". ""The EU knows it and so does Mr Varadkar, but he's playing a game for Irish politics and that needs to stop. The UK has to say to them [EU27 leaders]: 'You're putting at risk your own settlement if you don't agree something.'"" In Brussels, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker said there was ""no room whatsoever"" for renegotiation. He said the EU could give further clarification but that the withdrawal agreement, in all its parts including the backstop, would not be reopened. Allow Twitter content?

Reality Check unpacks the basics Northern Ireland has been without a functioning devolved government for almost two years, aftera row between the DUP and Sinn FÃ©inover a flawed green energy scheme. They are the two largest parties, which have to share power at Stormont due to structures set out in the Good Friday peace Agreement, but their opposite stances on Brexit have further strained relations. Former Prime Minister Sir John Major criticised the political breakdown during a speech he made at an event in Dublin on Tuesday. Sir John Major accused unionists opposing the backstop in the withdrawal agreement of ""breathtaking ignorance"" He told the Institute of International and European Affairs that Brexit had ""inserted its very own poison into the turbulent politics of Northern Ireland"". He also said the government was ""hindered"" in its attempts to restore power sharing at Stormont, due to the confidence-and-supply pact it signed up to with the DUP after last year's general election. The remarks came a day afterhe accused unionists opposing the backstop in the withdrawal agreementof ""breathtaking ignorance"". A summit of EU leaders is still due to take place this Thursday.

Is confidence vote looming?,"I know, I know, I know. We have been here before, and on more than one occasion. But senior Eurosceptics are more sure than ever that they have enough support to trigger a vote of no confidence in the prime minister. That doesn't mean it is bound to happen. The last time they said so, and said so pretty publicly, their confidence was a mirage and the numbers did not emerge.

May: EU leaders want to help save deal May calls off MPs' vote on her Brexit deal Why now? Since yesterday's delay, the frenzy around here has turned to anger. Pushing the vote on the Brexit compromise back might have been politically logical, but it's driven Tory MPs crazy. And not just on the Eurosceptic side. One former Remainer, who's been loyal to the PM so far, got in touch this morning to say they'd had enough and were putting their letter in, telling me what's happening right now is ""disgraceful"" and ""it's just about saving her skin"". And another former Remainer has just told me if the prime minister doesn't have the courage to bring a vote to the Commons on her deal before Christmas, they will submit a letter too. But, let's take a breath. There is of course, as you'll know if you read this blog often, no way right now of being sure how this will all play out. At 15.00 GMT I was pretty reliably told that the threshold for a contest hadn't been reached. Two and half hours later, the prime minister herself said that she hadn't been told it had. Remember, only one person really knows about the numbers, and that's Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the Tory Party's 1922 backbench committee. It seems unlikely now that there will be any dramatic movement tonight. The prime minister will be back from Brussels late this evening and, will then, if the plans don't change, face MPs at Prime Minister's Questions, then hold Cabinet, then head to Dublin to try again to save her Brexit deal by seeking further movement from her EU counterparts. But the threshold that would see that day interrupted by a challenge to her leadership may be reached, which would begin a formal process that might see her downfall, with a ballot perhaps on Monday. The rebels know of course, that the prime minister might win, leaving the Tory Party locked even more tightly into the mire. If she survived the vote, the prime minister is then theoretically safe for a year. And even if her detractors were to win what is right now a theoretical contest, there is no straightforward solution for any potential new leader. None of the rival Brexit tribes are big enough to get all of Westminster onside. It's still not the case there is an alternative plan that could get a majority in parliament. And even if there was, it's not the case for the Tories that they could agree on the best person to put it forward. And Labour isn't ready yet to try to force a vote of confidence that might remove the government. It's like this whole place is stuck in a trap where no one has an easy escape route at all, like the controversial backstop itself, no one on their own, can find a way out. But it's possible that MPs on her own side are about to provide the prime minister with a forced exit.

European media on 'Brexit poker',"Some European papers see more momentum towards a second referendum European media have described the postponement of the Brexit vote in Westminster variously as Theresa May's ""circus trick"" or ""Brexit poker"". Although the UK prime minister may have averted a government crisis, most commentators now think a second referendum is becoming an increasingly likely option.

Brexit vote: What could happen next?Five scenarios that could happen if MPs do eventually reject the deal.UK Politics,"The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is now in an 11-month transition period. During this period the UK effectively remains in the EU's customs union and single market and continues to obey EU rules. However, it is no longer part of the political institutions. So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament. MP's back Boris Johnson's plan What is Boris Johnson's deal with the EU? Future trade deal Negotiations on a trade deal with the EU have been proceeding for several months. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU. But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Both sides say there a still significant areas of disagreement - for example, on EU proposals for a so-called ""level playing field"", which would see the UK and EU maintain similar minimum standards on things like workers' rights and environmental protection. Brexit: What is a level playing field? The deadline for the two sides to agree an extension to the transition period has now passed. If no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU. The prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that makes negotiations more difficult. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed. It's also important to recognise that major changes will take effect on 1 January 2021 whether or not a trade deal is agreed. Free movement of people will end and businesses trading with the EU will have to follow new rules.

Trump in Oval Office scrap with DemocratsMr Trump publicly argued with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer over a budget to keep the government open.US & Canada,"This video can not be played Testy exchanges between Trump, Pelosi and Schumer in the Oval Office US President Donald Trump repeatedly threatened a government shutdown over funding for his proposed border wall in a budget row with top Democrats. During a heated exchange with Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer, Mr Trump said he would be ""proud"" to shut down the government over border security. If lawmakers cannot agree on a federal budget, funding for some departments will run out at the end of next week. Mr Trump has asked to include $5bn (Â£4bn) in the deal for border security. But Senator Schumer and Congresswoman Pelosi said they had agreed to extend funding for the Department of Homeland Security at current levels of $1.3bn (Â£1bn) until 30 September 2019. Mr Trump and the Democratic leadership often interrupted each other during the meeting Mr Trump opened the Oval Office meeting calling it a ""great honour"" to have Mr Schumer and Mrs Pelosi present, in their first meeting since Democrats took control of the House of Representatives in the November mid-term elections. But the meeting soon turned contentious as Mrs Pelosi and Mr Schumer argued that the Republican-controlled Congress could pass legislation before funding for some agencies was set to expire on 21 December. The president contended that it could only pass if it met his demands for more funding for his proposed border wall along the US southern border. Why does the US government shut down? ""If we don't get what we want, one way or the other, whether it's through you, through military, through anything you want to call, I will shut down the government,"" Mr Trump said. ""And I am proud to shut down the government for border security. I will take the mantle. I will be the one to shut it down."" Analysis by Anthony Zurcher, BBC Washington Donald Trump opened his press event with Democratic leaders Nancy Pelosi and Chuck Schumer with a feel-good embrace of bipartisanship. It didn't last long. The two Democrats and the president sparred over funding for the Mr Trump's proposed border wall. It seemed for a moment as though they might agree on funding for ""border security"" - but that linguistic pirouette disappeared beneath an onslaught of acrimony. The president wants his wall funding. He campaigned on it. He promised it. And even though Mexico isn't going to pay for it, he wants it now. Democrats, on the other hand, are loath to give him this victory. What's more, they're intent on having the blame for any government shutdown directed solely at the president. In the end Mr Trump gave the Democrats what they wanted. He said he would shut down the government if ""we don't get what we want"". He would be ""proud"" to do it. Democrats will try to make the president regret those words. Mr Trump, on the other hand, thinks the public - or at least his base - is with him in this fight. If neither side blinks, we'll know who is right in a few weeks. In an official readout following the meeting, White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said the Democrats have ""made clear they would rather keep the border open than the government open"". After the meeting, Democrat Chuck Schumer condemned Mr Trump's ""temper tantrum"" in the White House Oval Office. Nancy Pelosi, who is expected to become Speaker of the House when Democrats take over the chamber next month, mocked Mr Trump at a later meeting with colleagues on Capitol Hill. ""I was trying to be the mom,"" she said, sources told US media. ""It goes to show you: you get into a tinkle contest with a skunk, you get tinkle all over you."" She reportedly added that the president's insistence on a wall was ""a manhood thing"". Hours before the meeting, Mr Trump tweeted that ""the Military will build the remaining sections of the Wall"". But a defence department said later: ""To date, there is no plan to build sections of the wall."" This video can not be played Government workers on what happens during a shutdown If the budget stalemate cannot be resolved, funding for about a quarter of government departments, including justice, agriculture and homeland security, will run out on 21 December. The remaining parts of the federal government, including the defence department, have been funded until 2019. Hundreds of thousands of government employees would be forced to stay home in the event of a shutdown.

Kuenssberg: Now what?,"Now what? The prime minister didn't delay the vote because she wanted to. She and her team made the decision because the option of a horrendous defeat was more grim than the humiliation of delay. Cabinet ministers were arguing that even in these strange political times, some of the traditional political rules do still apply - don't call a vote that you can't win, and don't ask a question that you don't know the answer to. So Theresa May made it through another day. What now though? The very act of postponing the vote, in and of itself, has been another knock to the PM's credibility. Anyone listening to even a fraction of Monday's debate, while the PM stood there taking question after question after question, could not help but conclude that. May calls off MPs' vote on her Brexit deal The questioning was not just hostile, but also incredulous. The implication - how on earth, despite all the difficulties, has Theresa May allowed it to come to this? Tonight she is on her way to press the flesh once more with other European leaders. She'll see the normally friendly Dutch, the important Germans, and then is likely to arrive in Brussels to see the EU top brass. It's pretty clear already though that they are not in the market for making big changes - helpful verbal clarifications, or linguistic gymnastics perhaps - but a dramatic renegotiation of the divorce deal - forget it. What is the point then? Having one more heave might blunt at least some of the criticism. If Tory MPs have been saying she has to have another go, well, she is having another go, and some of those who were calling for that old chestnut ""she must do more"", may be satisfied. But as things stand, it seems unlikely that she'll be able to return to Parliament with anything that's very different to the agreement as negotiated. One source closely involved in the talks told me ""there is never going to be a withdrawal agreement without a backstop"". And it feels right now that Brexiteer and Remainer MPs are so entrenched in their positions that if there can't be a dramatic change, the numbers whenever a vote's called are very much against her. If there is no prospect of a real change then all that's been achieved is to postpone a likely defeat. And again that puts all the choices that will then become urgent and immediate about a real Plan B for the prime minister on hold. Right now she is trying to maintain her case that it's her deal or no deal, or no Brexit, ruling out another referendum again, at least under her leadership, and trying again to stick to the course. In blunt terms, though, perhaps it's as a senior Tory MP told me - the decision is just about trying to ""protect her bunker"". For today, to delay was to survive. And even though Parliament, and no doubt many more members of the public, more importantly, will be aghast at yet another delay in this long drawn-out saga, there is no plan, nor anything ready or with enough agreement from enough MPs to take its place.

Kuenssberg: Is confidence vote looming?,"I know, I know, I know. We have been here before, and on more than one occasion. But senior Eurosceptics are more sure than ever that they have enough support to trigger a vote of no confidence in the prime minister. That doesn't mean it is bound to happen. The last time they said so, and said so pretty publicly, their confidence was a mirage and the numbers did not emerge. It became evident to ardent Brexiteers that their communications between each other were not all genuine, and painfully so. Those who had told colleagues that they had submitted the letters, patently had not done so. What feels different tonight is that those who take this all extremely seriously, who had their hopes dashed the last time, are suggesting privately, not necessarily with glee, that they might have done it this time, and crucially if the list isn't long enough tonight, they have more MPs ready to join the calls. May: EU leaders want to help save deal May calls off MPs' vote on her Brexit deal Why now? Since yesterday's delay, the frenzy around here has turned to anger. Pushing the vote on the Brexit compromise back might have been politically logical, but it's driven Tory MPs crazy. And not just on the Eurosceptic side. One former Remainer, who's been loyal to the PM so far, got in touch this morning to say they'd had enough and were putting their letter in, telling me what's happening right now is ""disgraceful"" and ""it's just about saving her skin"". And another former Remainer has just told me if the prime minister doesn't have the courage to bring a vote to the Commons on her deal before Christmas, they will submit a letter too. But, let's take a breath. There is of course, as you'll know if you read this blog often, no way right now of being sure how this will all play out. At 15.00 GMT I was pretty reliably told that the threshold for a contest hadn't been reached. Two and half hours later, the prime minister herself said that she hadn't been told it had. Remember, only one person really knows about the numbers, and that's Sir Graham Brady, the chair of the Tory Party's 1922 backbench committee. It seems unlikely now that there will be any dramatic movement tonight. The prime minister will be back from Brussels late this evening and, will then, if the plans don't change, face MPs at Prime Minister's Questions, then hold Cabinet, then head to Dublin to try again to save her Brexit deal by seeking further movement from her EU counterparts. But the threshold that would see that day interrupted by a challenge to her leadership may be reached, which would begin a formal process that might see her downfall, with a ballot perhaps on Monday. The rebels know of course, that the prime minister might win, leaving the Tory Party locked even more tightly into the mire. If she survived the vote, the prime minister is then theoretically safe for a year. And even if her detractors were to win what is right now a theoretical contest, there is no straightforward solution for any potential new leader. None of the rival Brexit tribes are big enough to get all of Westminster onside. It's still not the case there is an alternative plan that could get a majority in parliament. And even if there was, it's not the case for the Tories that they could agree on the best person to put it forward. And Labour isn't ready yet to try to force a vote of confidence that might remove the government. It's like this whole place is stuck in a trap where no one has an easy escape route at all, like the controversial backstop itself, no one on their own, can find a way out. But it's possible that MPs on her own side are about to provide the prime minister with a forced exit.

Man held by armed police at UK Parliament,"This video can not be played The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg witnessed the man being pinned to the ground by police A man has been arrested by armed police officers after it is believed he broke into the grounds of Parliament. An eyewitness told the BBC the man jumped over railings before being Tasered by police. The man was held within the parliamentary courtyard but has now been taken away in a police van. Police say he has been arrested on suspicion of trespassing at a protected site and is now being investigated by the Met's counter terrorism command. The Metropolitan Police said the man ran towards officers and a Taser was used when he did not comply with their requests to stop. He is to undergo a mental health assessment, police said. Parliamentary authorities say the incident, which happened just before midday on Tuesday, is contained. Police Taser the man The man is then arrested on suspicion of trespassing at a protected site Christopher Hope, a reporter for the Daily Telegraph, told BBC News: ""I heard a scream and then looked out the window, and then about half a dozen police officers who appeared not to be armed were running towards a man. ""And then it appears the man was Tasered. ""It appears to be contained now. There are armed police patrolling downstairs by the Christmas tree."" BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, who also witnessed the disturbance, says she saw the man on the ground, arguing and shouting at police. Police gathered up his belongings, including what looked like a passport, before bundling him into the back of a police van, she added. The incident, which is still in the very early stages of being investigated, happened in the same area inside Parliament's grounds as last year's terror attack. PC Keith Palmer, who was guarding the gates, was stabbed and killed by Khalid Masood, moments after he had knocked down pedestrians indiscriminately on Westminster Bridge, killing four people. Masood was shot dead by armed officers.

'Several hurt' as shots fired in Strasbourg,"This video can not be played Pater Fritz describes hearing gunshots and attending to a victim of the Strasbourg shooting Hundreds of police officers are hunting a gunman after three people were killed and 12 others wounded in a shooting in the eastern French city of Strasbourg. The suspect, who is known to security services, escaped after exchanging fire with soldiers and armed police on Tuesday. He is believed to be injured. The shooting happened close to a popular Christmas market near one of the central squares, Place KlÃ©ber. France's counter-terrorism prosecutor has opened an investigation. There were reports on Wednesday morning that a police operation had been launched around the cathedral area in the city. The motive for the shooting remains unclear. ""He fought twice with our security forces,"" French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said. Armed police secure the area after the deadly shooting incident on Tuesday Confirming that three people had died, Mr Castaner said that border controls had been strengthened and security at all Christmas markets would be stepped up, with 350 security agents hunting for the gunman. He added that France had raised its security alert level to ""emergency attack"". Six of those reportedly injured on Tuesday were said to be in a serious condition, while six others suffered light injuries, police said. Police added that the 29-year-old suspect was born in Strasbourg and was already known to the security services as a possible terrorist threat. Police searched the narrow streets near the Christmas market in Strasbourg According to France's BFM TV the man had fled his flat in the Neudorf district of the city on Tuesday morning as it was being searched by police in connection with a robbery. Grenades were found during the search. Residents in Neudorf were urged to stay indoors following unconfirmed reports that the suspect had been tracked down and cornered by police in the area. The European Parliament, which is nearby, was placed on lockdown. The parliament's president, Antonio Tajani, tweeted to say it would ""not be intimidated by terrorist or criminal attacks"".

The attack unfolded at around 20:00 local time (19:00 GMT) close to Strasbourg's famed Christmas market, which attracts thousands of visitors at this time of year. Eyewitness Pater Fritz told the BBC he heard gunfire and found a person who had been shot, lying on a bridge. He said he tried to resuscitate him but the man died. ""There are no ambulance services able to enter the area, apparently,"" he said, adding: ""After 45 minutes we stopped the resuscitation [attempt], because a doctor told us on the phone that it was senseless."" Another eyewitness, who gave his name as Fatih, told AFP news agency that after the shots were fired there was ""pandemonium"" on the streets. ""People were running everywhere,"" he said. Local journalist Bruno Poussard wrote on Twitter that there had been a dozen shots fired on his street in the city centre - one or two to begin with, then in bursts. Emmanuel Foulon, a press officer for the European Parliament, wrote that there was ""panic"" in the centre following the sound of gunfire and that police with guns were running through the streets. A shopkeeper told BFM TV: ""There were gun shots and people running everywhere. It lasted about 10 minutes.""

"Breaking|Breaking news'Two hurt' as shots fired in StrasbourgGunshots fired in centre of French city of Strasbourg, at least two people hurt, police say.Europe","This video can not be played Pater Fritz describes hearing gunshots and attending to a victim of the Strasbourg shooting Hundreds of police officers are hunting a gunman after three people were killed and 12 others wounded in a shooting in the eastern French city of Strasbourg. The suspect, who is known to security services, escaped after exchanging fire with soldiers and armed police on Tuesday. He is believed to be injured. The shooting happened close to a popular Christmas market near one of the central squares, Place KlÃ©ber. France's counter-terrorism prosecutor has opened an investigation. There were reports on Wednesday morning that a police operation had been launched around the cathedral area in the city. The motive for the shooting remains unclear. ""He fought twice with our security forces,"" French Interior Minister Christophe Castaner said. Armed police secure the area after the deadly shooting incident on Tuesday Confirming that three people had died, Mr Castaner said that border controls had been strengthened and security at all Christmas markets would be stepped up, with 350 security agents hunting for the gunman. He added that France had raised its security alert level to ""emergency attack"". Six of those reportedly injured on Tuesday were said to be in a serious condition, while six others suffered light injuries, police said. Police added that the 29-year-old suspect was born in Strasbourg and was already known to the security services as a possible terrorist threat. Police searched the narrow streets near the Christmas market in Strasbourg According to France's BFM TV the man had fled his flat in the Neudorf district of the city on Tuesday morning as it was being searched by police in connection with a robbery. Grenades were found during the search. Residents in Neudorf were urged to stay indoors following unconfirmed reports that the suspect had been tracked down and cornered by police in the area. The European Parliament, which is nearby, was placed on lockdown. The parliament's president, Antonio Tajani, tweeted to say it would ""not be intimidated by terrorist or criminal attacks"".

French President Emmanuel Macron, who had attended a crisis meeting with cabinet officials in Paris, later tweeted that the ""solidarity of the entire nation"" was with Strasbourg, the victims and their families. The attack unfolded at around 20:00 local time (19:00 GMT) close to Strasbourg's famed Christmas market, which attracts thousands of visitors at this time of year. Eyewitness Pater Fritz told the BBC he heard gunfire and found a person who had been shot, lying on a bridge. He said he tried to resuscitate him but the man died. ""There are no ambulance services able to enter the area, apparently,"" he said, adding: ""After 45 minutes we stopped the resuscitation [attempt], because a doctor told us on the phone that it was senseless."" Another eyewitness, who gave his name as Fatih, told AFP news agency that after the shots were fired there was ""pandemonium"" on the streets. ""People were running everywhere,"" he said. Local journalist Bruno Poussard wrote on Twitter that there had been a dozen shots fired on his street in the city centre - one or two to begin with, then in bursts. Emmanuel Foulon, a press officer for the European Parliament, wrote that there was ""panic"" in the centre following the sound of gunfire and that police with guns were running through the streets. A shopkeeper told BFM TV: ""There were gun shots and people running everywhere. It lasted about 10 minutes."" British MEP Richard Corbett tweeted that he was in a restaurant in the city and the doors had been locked. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Google chief denies political bias claims,"This video can not be played WATCH: 'If you Google the word idiot, a picture of Donald Trump comes up?' Google chief Sundar Pichai has faced accusations of political bias from US politicians. Mr Pichai was being quizzed by members of the House Judiciary Committee about the way his tech firm runs it business. Google was accused of having ""programmed"" bias against conservative views into its algorithms. Mr Pichai denied the accusation saying he had ""issues"" with studies that claimed to show the firm's search results excluded right-wing views. He was asked by Democrat committee member Zoe Lofgren why, when she googled the word ""idiot"" under images, a picture of President Donald Trump came up. In response, Mr Pichai explained that keywords were matched against billions of page results and ranked for relevance, popularity and how other people are using the word. Republican committee member Lamar Smith said conservative voices were being ""muted"" via Google's search results. ""Such actions pose a grave threat to our democratic form of government,"" he said. ""This does not happen by accident, it is baked in to the algorithms."" Mr Pichai said independent studies had not uncovered any bias and added that his business was ""transparent"" about the way its search results were generated. ""We evaluate our studies and our research results,"" said Mr Pichai. ""We have a wide variety of sources, from both left and right."" He added that it was ""impossible"" for any individual or group of individuals to manipulate its algorithms. In response to a further question about perceived bias, he said: ""I'm confident we don't approach our work with any political bias."" He added: ""It's important that we look at outcomes and assess that there's no evidence of bias."" Google has faced protests about the search engine it is working on for China Mr Pichai was also asked about the work Google was doing in China on the controversial ""dragonfly"" project. This is believed to be a search engine drawn up under the oversight of the Chinese government that would censor topics at the behest of the regime. Mr Pichai said ""the number of engineers on the project have varied over time, but at one point we had over 100 people working on it"", in response to questioning from Republican committee member Keith Rothfus. Democratic committee member Sheila Jackson Lee suggested the work could ""censor a Chinese person's lifeline to  democracy"". She asked: ""How can you do that?"" In response, Mr Pichai said: ""Right now we have no plans to launch in China. We don't have a search product there. He said all efforts were ""internal"" and did not currently involve discussions with the Chinese government. ""Our core mission is to provide users with access to information and getting access to information is an important human right,"" said Mr Pichai. ""We are always compelled across the world to try hard to provide that information."" In response to further questions, Mr Pichai said the company would be ""fully transparent"" with politicians if the company released a search service in China. Google+ to end early after second bug find Google hearing: Seven things to watch China's new games censors take tough stance Politicians asked about the amount of data that Android phones gather Mr Pichai was questioned extensively about the amount of information that Google collected and what it did with the ""mountains"" of data it gathered. The Google boss said many times that it gave people ""choices"" about the types of data it collected and that it regularly reminded people about their privacy settings. He said 20 million people a day adjusted their privacy settings to change the types of information they let Google amass. Mr Pichai had been under growing pressure to testify after he snubbed an earlier hearing called by the Senate Intelligence Committee.

Â£8 per day for broadband failure,"Many customers who experience fixed broadband or landline loss will soon automatically receive compensation. The Â£8-per-day deal follows a new agreement between Openreach and five of the UK's internet service providers. It will apply only when the fault takes longer than two days to fix. If an engineer does not arrive on schedule, or cancels within 24 hours, the compensation will be Â£25. There will also be Â£5-per-day offered for new services not starting on time. BT, Sky, TalkTalk, Virgin Media and Zen Internet have all agreed to the plan, which is not compulsory for the industry. Plusnet and EE have also previously suggested that they will sign up. The deal follows industry watchdog Ofcom releasing details of its voluntary automatic compensation code of practice in November 2017, which set the payout rate. It said at the time it would allow a 15-month implementation period for the new system meaning it should be ready in early 2019. Openreach said it would pay compensation even when others prevented it from accessing its network - if, for example, a vehicle is parked in front of a cabinet or it is unable to access a pole on private land. But it said it would not pay in  the event of ""measures beyond reasonable control"", such as flooding. Internet speed guarantees 'must be realistic' Number of mobile calls drops for first time UK broadband speeds leap ahead, according to Ofcom However, the internet service providers who have signed up may still be obliged to pay in those cases, said journalist and IT consultant Mark Jackson,writing on the website ISPreview,external. ""Openreach's steadfast position not to pay out during 'force majeure-type events' has caused some irritation, particularly while Ofcom continues to insist that retail ISPs will have to cover the cost of that themselves,"" he wrote. Mr Jackson also noted that most faults are fixed within two days, meaning that compensation will not apply. Both home and small and medium business customers will be eligible. Openreach said in a statement that it has offered compensation for broadband failures since 2008. ""We have fully supported Ofcom's voluntary code of practice since its inception, and are pleased to have reached an agreement with those communication providers intending to offer automatic compensation,"" it said. A spokesman for the regulator said: ""We're pleased this agreement has been reached, following our intervention to secure automatic compensation for customers facing problems such as delays and missed appointments.""

Internet chat user killed himself online,"Leon Jenkins was found at his Cardiff home in June A builder who killed himself was found when police were alerted by users of an online chat room, an inquest has heard. Leon Jenkins, 43, was found hanged at his flat in Cardiff in June, the hearing at Pontypridd, Rhondda Cynon Taff, was told. The inquest heard he had been active on the Paltalk online chat forums at the time he died. Assistant Coroner Rachel Knight said there was no evidence of any goading of Mr Jenkins online. She said concerns had previously been raised that Paltalk was an ""unhelpful website"" following the deaths of two other British men who were also known to have used it. But she added: ""I haven't seen anything to make me believe he was being encouraged."" Police broke into his home after being contacted by an online administrator for the Paltalk forums, a service that allows individuals to talk to each other online across the world. The officers were met with ""foreign accents"" coming from a computer, asking if what they could see was real. One voice replied: ""Oh my God - it was real."" The coroner's court was told that a live online streaming camera was found and disconnected, as officers attempted to resuscitate Mr Jenkins. How to recognise if someone needs help Mental health: When does it become a problem? Phone records showed Mr Jenkins' last outgoing call was made to a woman from Tennessee in the USA, who had been his girlfriend despite the pair never meeting in person. Miss Knight said of Mr Jenkins: ""He did live life in reality but he did live part of that online and spent quite a lot of his time online."" Investigators spoke to several individuals who used the chat rooms with Mr Jenkins from Canada, the US and Australia. One told police that Mr Jenkins was ""a bit of an eccentric"". The inquest heard that he had a history of mental health issues that had required intervention in the past. The coroner was told Mr Jenkins had become withdrawn since March and was not answering phone calls from family members. Recording a conclusion of suicide, the coroner Rachel Knight said it was clear that Mr Jenkins had a network of friends around the world online who were concerned for him. She said it was ""more likely than not that he intended to end his life"".

William and Kate told of Spice devastation,"The Duke and Duchess of Cambridge have been moved by the devastation caused by the synthetic drug Spice during a visit to a homelessness charity he first visited with his late mother. The couple heard that increasing numbers of rough sleepers are becoming addicted to Spice, which can leave users in a ""zombie-like"" state. The duke and duchess were touring a London centre run by The Passage. Also known as Mamba, Spice was outlawed two years ago. William first visited the charity in 1994 with his younger brother Harry, when the pair were 12 and 10, alongside their mother Diana, Princess of Wales. The Passage's chief executive Mick Clarke praised the couple's ""real empathy"". Spice 'most severe public health issue in decades' Living life as a 'zombie' on Spice ""They very much care about the issue and I think it marks the way they care about the poorest in society,"" he said. The duke and duchess joined in with an arts and crafts workshop at the centre, preparing gifts ahead of its Christmas party. During the visit the duke told Mr Clarke: ""The fact it was a legal high and that young people were allowed to take it and it leads to addiction is just terrible."" The charity said a survey of its homeless clients this year found that 70% had tried Spice - up from 50% when similar research was carried out two years ago. The Duke of Cambridge had a private briefing from The Passage's chief executive Mick Clare Earlier in the day, the duke and duchess visited Evelina London Children's Hospital following the announcement that the duchess was to become its new patron. The Duchess was greeted at the hospital by six-year-old Tiana Hayles The Evelina is part of Guy's and St Thomas' NHS Foundation Trust, of which the Queen is Patron, and treats children with complex and rare conditions from birth into adulthood. The duke and duchess both got involved in Christmas crafting with some of the families in Evelina's atrium.

"'I was aged 24, and dead for five minutes'","Lora says doctors told her she was dead for five minutes More than 80,000 young people in the UK could be living with undiagnosed heart conditions, the British Heart Foundation has warned. If undetected, the consequences can be fatal. ""My lips had started going blue, I'd stopped breathing, my heart had stopped,"" Lora D'Alesio tells the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programme, recounting how she went into cardiac arrest. ""I was lifeless and dead for five minutes, and I understand the doctors were working tirelessly to bring me back to life."" Three years ago the 27 year-old veterinary nurse collapsed at home, having returned from work. ""I said I felt faint, and when [my housemate] turned round to check on me, I was on the floor. She thought I was messing around at first."" Lora woke up in hospital confused, after three days in a coma Like many young people in her situation, Lora was not aware at the time that she had a serious heart condition. Her life was saved by the emergency services, and after three days in a coma she woke up in hospital. ""I was crying because I was so confused,"" she explains. Lora was diagnosed with something called Long QT syndrome - an inherited problem affecting the heart's rhythm, where the heart muscle takes longer to recharge between beats. ""At my age, I thought, 'No way.' I was 24 for goodness sake. ""You think of older people dropping dead because of frail hearts or heart disease, but not young people."" New research from the British Heart Foundation estimates 83,000 people aged 15 to 25 may have a faulty gene that puts them at an unusually high risk of developing heart disease or dying suddenly at a young age. Many of those people will never have any issues with their heart, but some will only discover they have got a problem when they suffer a cardiac arrest. Diagnosis rates are very low, so the vast majority of these anomalies will be undetected. Prof Behr is researching the genetic causes of heart attacks Prof Elijah Behr, a leading heart doctor at St George's, University of London, says that while inherited heart disorders are rare, ""when you add them together they actually add up to a significant number"". ""In fact, around 1,500 young people a year die suddenly in the UK from these inherited heart conditions. And that's the challenge - to identify those individuals and try to prevent those deaths,"" he adds. Prof Behr is now working to determine the genetic causes of heart attacks, and hopes the information can be used to prevent sudden deaths in future. Some doctors feel that mandatory screening for young people would help catch these conditions earlier, but others say more research needs to be done before it could be introduced. Dan Wilkinson, with his father Barry In 2016, Barry and Gill Wilkinson's son Dan Wilkinson died after collapsing playing football. He was aged 24 at the time and had lived an active lifestyle, having previously played for Hull City's youth team. ""He had a serious heart issue, but there was nothing to tell him, or us, that there was something wrong,"" his father reflects. ""Twenty-four hours before, we had FaceTimed and he was his usual self."" Dan had a condition known as ARVC (Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy), which weakens the wall of the heart and can lead to a cardiac arrest. He collapsed during the second half while playing for non-league side Shaw Lane AFC. Dan had previously played for Hull City's youth team ""My phone went and it was one of his team-mates,"" Barry remembers. ""They said Dan had collapsed, would we be able to get there?"" By the time they did, he had died. ""You just go into shock,"" his mother Gill says. Barry tries to stifle the tears as the couple discuss how they wish they could have told him they loved him one final time. They have now started a charity, through which they have bought defibrillators for grassroots football clubs. One has since been used to save the life of a 14-year-old boy playing for his local team in Yorkshire. Lora hopes that she can make a difference by speaking publicly about her own experiences. ""I really want young people to be aware that this could happen to them. Heart disease doesn't discriminate,"" she says. She has been fitted with a defibrillator and pacemaker in her chest, which may one day be called upon to save her life. But for now, she says she is trying to make the most of every day. ""I say 'yes' to the random outings my friends invite me to, because I never know if or when it could happen again and kill me this time. ""I just live life to the fullest now,"" she adds, ""I'm lucky to be alive."" Follow the Victoria Derbyshire programme onFacebook,externalandTwitter,external- and see more of our storieshere.

Babes in Wood killer jailed for life,"This video can not be played Karen Hadaway and Nicola Fellows disappeared while out playing Convicted paedophile Russell Bishop has been jailed for life for the murders of two schoolgirls 32 years ago. The Babes in the Wood killer will serve a minimum of 36 years after being found guilty at a second trial on Monday. Bishop, aged 20 in 1986, killed nine-year-olds Nicola Fellows and Karen Hadaway in a woodland den in Brighton. In 1987 he was cleared of their murders, but within three years kidnapped another girl and left her for dead, the Old Bailey heard. ""Finally, justice has been done and Bishop has been seen as the evil monster he really is,"" Karen's mother Michelle Hadaway said following the verdict. 'Cowardly' killer's three decades of lies How Russell Bishop walked free in 1987 Bishop, aged 52, who was already serving a life term for attempting to murder the seven-year-old girl at Devil's Dyke in 1990, had refused to attend court for his sentencing. In his absence the judge Mr Justice Sweeney, described him as a ""predatory paedophile"" who had shown no remorse. ""The terror that each girl must have suffered in their final moments is unimaginable,"" he said. A memorial tree stands in Wild Park where the girls died The two girls went missing from their homes after they had gone out to play on 9 October 1986. They were found in Wild Park the next day, lying together in a woodland den as if they were sleeping. Bishop was among the first on the scene when they were found and protested his innocence throughout the police investigation and during his first trial. But less than three years later, in a case which bore ""striking similarities"", he kidnapped the seven-year-old girl who had been roller skating in Brighton. He drove her to Devil's Dyke on the South Downs, where he strangled and molested her, leaving her for dead, the court was told. As he sentenced him, Mr Justice Sweeney said he had ""no doubt"" Bishop was a ""predatory paedophile"" who had lured Karen and Nicola into the woods. But it was not until a DNA breakthrough was made in the case, that Bishop was told he would face a new trial over their killings, under the double jeopardy law. A sweatshirt discarded on his route home linked him to the scene while a sample from Karen's left forearm revealed a ""one in a billion"" DNA match, his second trial was told. The court heard a blue Pinto sweatshirt linked Bishop to the scene In a victim impact statement Nicola's mother, Sue Eismann, said her world ""turned upside down"" after Bishop killed her daughter. ""I have lived with the pain, the loss and sheer hate towards him for what he had done for the last 32 years,"" she said. ""Russell Bishop is a horrible, wicked man. No child is safe if he is allowed to be free."" During the trial, Bishop tried to cast suspicion on Nicola's father Barrie, who since the first trial had put up with rumours of his involvement in her death. Man 'not party to daughter's killing' Murder-accused offers EastEnders alibi Jurors urged to 'right 32-year injustice' ""Thirty-two years is a long time to be suspected of murdering your daughter,"" Mr Fellows said. ""I have been through every feeling imaginable from hope to sheer dread. ""Words cannot describe how I feel about Russell Bishop."" Bishop was originally cleared of the girls' murders in 1987 Det Sup Jeff Riley, of Sussex Police, described Bishop as a ""truly wicked man"". ""Bishop will hopefully spend the remainder of his life behind bars where he truly belongs and never darken the streets of Brighton again,"" he said following the sentencing.

Wages rise at fastest pace for decade,"Wages are continuing to rise at their highest level for nearly a decade,the latest official Office for National Statistics figures show.,external Compared with a year earlier, wages excluding bonuses, were up by 3.3% for the three months to October, the biggest rise since November 2008. Average weekly wages are Â£495 - the highest since 2011, when adjusted for inflation. The number of people in work rose by 79,000 to 32.48 million, a record high. That is the highest figure since records began in 1971. Unemployment increased by 20,000 to 1.38 million, although the margin of error is 70,000 and the total is still lower than a year ago. The number of unemployed men increased by 27,000, while the number of unemployed women fell by 8,000. The reason both employment and unemployment have increased is a result of the UK's rising population and more people joining the labour force, such as students and older people. Job vacancies were up by 10,000 on the quarter to a record high of 848,000. More than half, 195,000, of the 329,000 jobs created in the year to October went to people who are no longer economically inactive, who are the main reason for the expansion in the workforce There are fewer students, people who are not working because of caring responsibilities, long-term sick and retired people in the 16 to 64 age group than a year ago. Minimum wage rises 'hit profits, not jobs' London dominates UK jobs growth over past decade Firms 'struggling to recruit as overseas staff stay away' ""Real earnings are now growing faster than at any time since around the end of 2016,"" said the ONS senior statistician Matt Hughes. Employment Minister Alok Sharma said: ""Today's statistics show the enduring strength of our jobs market, with wages outpacing inflation for the ninth month in a row and employment at a record high."" Shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood said: ""The reality behind these figures is that the number of people in work in poverty is rising faster than employment. Real wages are still lower than they were 10 years ago."" Fears that the labour market is tightening were expressed by the CBI's Matthew Percival and Suren Thiru, of the British Chambers of Commerce, Mr Percival said this was shown by ""a record employment rate and a rising number of jobs that can't be filled"". He added: ""While pay growth is improving at its fastest and most sustained rate in a decade, this is still slower than the UK has achieved in the past."" Mr Thiru blamed ""the second successive rise in unemployment, coupled with a decline in the number of people who are not seeking work"" for the labour market's contraction. ""Businesses report that the political and economic turbulence, together with significant difficulties finding the right staff, are diminishing recruitment intentions, which is likely to increasingly weigh on the UK labour market over the near term,"" he added. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""The rise in pay growth is little consolation for workers in the middle of the longest pay squeeze in 200 years, with real wages expected only to get back to pre-crisis level in 2024. We need a plan that supports jobs and wages."" Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: ""Current decent employment may be influenced by companies being keen to employ while they can, given the increased concern in some sectors over a lack of suitably skilled candidates. ""In some cases this has been significantly influenced by fewer workers coming from the EU,"" he said. In a note, analysts Capital Economics said: ""The latest labour market figures suggest that a recovery in real pay growth is taking root. This supports our view that GDP growth will rebound next year if a 'no-deal' Brexit is avoided. ""Admittedly, there have been false dawns in the past few years. But we think that the recent recovery in real earnings growth will probably be sustained."" Stephen Clarke, of the Resolution Foundation think tank, said: ""While Brexit uncertainty and political paralysis are having a cooling effect on the wider economy, the labour market is proving more resilient."" He added that pay should improve in 2019, but warned: ""After a pretty appalling decade, Britain remains some way off a return to the levels of real pay we enjoyed before the crash.""

Brexit vote: What could happen next?,"The UK left the EU on 31 January 2020 and is now in an 11-month transition period. During this period the UK effectively remains in the EU's customs union and single market and continues to obey EU rules. However, it is no longer part of the political institutions. So, for example, there are no longer any British MEPs in the European Parliament. MP's back Boris Johnson's plan What is Boris Johnson's deal with the EU? Future trade deal Negotiations on a trade deal with the EU have been proceeding for several months. The UK wants as much access as possible for its goods and services to the EU. But the government has made clear that the UK must leave the customs union and single market and end the overall jurisdiction of the European Court of Justice. Both sides say there a still significant areas of disagreement - for example, on EU proposals for a so-called ""level playing field"", which would see the UK and EU maintain similar minimum standards on things like workers' rights and environmental protection. Brexit: What is a level playing field? The deadline for the two sides to agree an extension to the transition period has now passed. If no trade deal has been agreed and ratified by the end of the year, then the UK faces the prospect of tariffs on exports to the EU. The prime minister has argued that as the UK is completely aligned to EU rules, the negotiation should be straightforward. But critics have pointed out that the UK wishes to have the freedom to diverge from EU rules so it can do deals with other countries - and that makes negotiations more difficult. It's not just a trade deal that needs to be sorted out. The UK must agree how it is going to co-operate with the EU on security and law enforcement. The UK is set to leave the European Arrest Warrant scheme and will have to agree a replacement. It must also agree deals in a number of other areas where co-operation is needed. It's also important to recognise that major changes will take effect on 1 January 2021 whether or not a trade deal is agreed. Free movement of people will end and businesses trading with the EU will have to follow new rules.

Six migrants rescued from shipping lane,"This video can not be played The dinghy appeared to be taking in water as it approached the coast Fourteen migrants have been rescued from two dinghies in the Channel and brought ashore at Dover. Coastguards and a lifeboat crew were called at about 03:30 GMT to a small boat, in the Dover Strait - the world's busiest shipping lane. The Home Office said the boat contained five men and one woman, who claimed to be Iranian nationals. A second boat with eight men, all saying they were Iranian, was intercepted at about 12:00. More than 100 migrants, the majority of whom say they are Iranian, crossed the Channel towards Kent in November. Warnings have gone out from the UK authorities about the dangers of taking small boats on the Dover-Calais route. A Home Office spokesman said the coastguard contacted the Border Force in the early hours. A cutter and a lifeboat were sent to assist a dinghy with six people on board. They were brought back to Dover onboard the cutter. ""They received a medical assessment and have now been transferred to immigration officials for interview,"" he added. At about midday the coastguard reported a second boat off the coast of Dover with eight men on board. A Border Force cutter and coastal patrol vessel were sent to help a rigid-hulled inflatable boat (RHIB), The Home Office said. ""The men, who all presented themselves as Iranian nationals, have been brought to shore"", the spokesman said. The have been passed to the immigration service, he said. The six people on the boat claimed to be Iranian French border official Our greatest fear is, on the one hand, a collision that leads to a loss of human life and, what's more, an accident at sea that we need to assist with. On the other hand, our other fear is having injured people at sea and bodies on the beaches. We do not want it to come to that. Why are Iranians crossing the Channel in dinghies? The BBC has confirmed that at least 126 migrants haveentered British waters since 3 November, with the majority presenting themselves as Iranian.

A spokeswoman for the Kent Refugee Action Network said the number of Iranians trying to enter the UK was unusually high. ""We haven't had this increase for some time. Iranians have always previously come in small numbers,"" she said. 11 December -Six people, thought to be from Iran were rescued from a small boat off the Kent coast.

"Throw laser pointers away, parents told","Laser pointers can have ""terrifying"" consequences for children's eyesight and should be thrown away, suggest safety experts. In the run-up to Christmas, Trading Standards officers are stressing such devices are not genuine toys. Since 2012, at least 47 children have suffered permanent eye damage as a result of lasers being shone in their faces. The government has promised to do more to stop such devices being imported. At the moment it is illegal in the UK to sell lasers that produce more than 1 milliWatt of power. However, many that are within the legal limit do not conform to EU safety standards, and some are more powerful than their label suggests. Lasers are 'offensive weapons' ""The biggest problem is that many of these products can be purchased via the internet and are sourced from businesses outside the EU,"" said Robert Chantry-Price, of the Chartered Trading Standards Institute. ""As a consequence, they may not have been tested for their safety."" Trading Standards said children were at greater risk of injuries than adults, as they tend not to blink or turn their eyes away if a laser is shone into their face. Those who already own a laser are being told that throwing them away is the ""safest thing to do"". Following an enquiry last year, the government has promised more support to stop high-powered lasers being imported. It wants better labelling, and more public awareness of the dangers. As a result Trading Standards has launched anew video,externaland poster campaign to try and cut down on the number of injuries to children. The law regarding those who use lasers to try and distract pilots, air traffic controllers or motorists was tightened earlier this year.

But many in the international community believe he was killed on the orders of theSaudi Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman, known as MBS, of whom he had been critical. Mr Khashoggi had been in self-imposed exile in the US, from where he wrote a column for the Washington Post. He was in Istanbul seeking documentation so he could marry his Turkish fiancee. The killing has led to international condemnation of Saudi Arabia, but US President Trump and his administration have refrained from joining others in blaming MBS.

Paedophile jailed for Babes in Wood murders,"This video can not be played Karen Hadaway and Nicola Fellows disappeared while out playing Convicted paedophile Russell Bishop has been jailed for life for the murders of two schoolgirls 32 years ago. The Babes in the Wood killer will serve a minimum of 36 years after being found guilty at a second trial on Monday. Bishop, aged 20 in 1986, killed nine-year-olds Nicola Fellows and Karen Hadaway in a woodland den in Brighton. In 1987 he was cleared of their murders, but within three years kidnapped another girl and left her for dead, the Old Bailey heard. ""Finally, justice has been done and Bishop has been seen as the evil monster he really is,"" Karen's mother Michelle Hadaway said following the verdict. 'Cowardly' killer's three decades of lies How Russell Bishop walked free in 1987 Bishop, aged 52, who was already serving a life term for attempting to murder the seven-year-old girl at Devil's Dyke in 1990, had refused to attend court for his sentencing. In his absence the judge Mr Justice Sweeney, described him as a ""predatory paedophile"" who had shown no remorse. ""The terror that each girl must have suffered in their final moments is unimaginable,"" he said. A memorial tree stands in Wild Park where the girls died The two girls went missing from their homes after they had gone out to play on 9 October 1986. They were found in Wild Park the next day, lying together in a woodland den as if they were sleeping. Bishop was among the first on the scene when they were found and protested his innocence throughout the police investigation and during his first trial. But less than three years later, in a case which bore ""striking similarities"", he kidnapped the seven-year-old girl who had been roller skating in Brighton. He drove her to Devil's Dyke on the South Downs, where he strangled and molested her, leaving her for dead, the court was told. As he sentenced him, Mr Justice Sweeney said he had ""no doubt"" Bishop was a ""predatory paedophile"" who had lured Karen and Nicola into the woods. But it was not until a DNA breakthrough was made in the case, that Bishop was told he would face a new trial over their killings, under the double jeopardy law. A sweatshirt discarded on his route home linked him to the scene while a sample from Karen's left forearm revealed a ""one in a billion"" DNA match, his second trial was told. The court heard a blue Pinto sweatshirt linked Bishop to the scene In a victim impact statement Nicola's mother, Sue Eismann, said her world ""turned upside down"" after Bishop killed her daughter. ""I have lived with the pain, the loss and sheer hate towards him for what he had done for the last 32 years,"" she said. ""Russell Bishop is a horrible, wicked man. No child is safe if he is allowed to be free."" During the trial, Bishop tried to cast suspicion on Nicola's father Barrie, who since the first trial had put up with rumours of his involvement in her death. Man 'not party to daughter's killing' Murder-accused offers EastEnders alibi Jurors urged to 'right 32-year injustice' ""Thirty-two years is a long time to be suspected of murdering your daughter,"" Mr Fellows said. ""I have been through every feeling imaginable from hope to sheer dread. ""Words cannot describe how I feel about Russell Bishop."" Bishop was originally cleared of the girls' murders in 1987 Det Sup Jeff Riley, of Sussex Police, described Bishop as a ""truly wicked man"". ""Bishop will hopefully spend the remainder of his life behind bars where he truly belongs and never darken the streets of Brighton again,"" he said following the sentencing. ""This significant term of imprisonment will of course never make up for the loss of Karen and Nicola but I hope their families will take some comfort from it.""

East Antarctica's glaciers are stirring,"This video can not be played Catherine Walker: ""East Antarctica has generally been regarded as boring to scientists looking for change"" Nasa says it has detected the first signs of significant melting in a swathe of glaciers in East Antarctica. The region has long been considered stable and unaffected by some of the more dramatic changes occurring elsewhere on the continent. But satellites have now shown that ice streams running into the ocean along one-eighth of the eastern coastline have thinned and sped up. If this trend continues, it has consequences for future sea levels. There is enough ice in the drainage basins in this sector of Antarctica to raise the height of the global oceans by 28m - if it were all to melt out. ""That's the water equivalent to four Greenlands of ice,"" said Catherine Walker from Nasa's Goddard Space Flight Center in Greenbelt, Maryland. The glaciologist has been detailing her work hereat the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union (AGU),external. Palu tsunami clue found on seafloor Voyager 2 probe 'leaves Solar System' The vast scale of life beneath our feet Dr Walker has been making the most of a new initiative at the agency to process huge numbers of satellite images to get a more resolved and more timely view of what is happening in East Antarctica. Previously, scientists had been aware that the region's Totten Glacier was experiencing melting, most probably as a result of its terminus being affronted by warm water coming up from the deep ocean. Pretty much everything else in that part of the continent was considered stagnant, however. The new satellite elevation and velocity maps change this view. They make it clear that nearby glaciers to Totten are also starting to respond in a similar way. Marked change is detected in the Vincennes Bay and Denman areas just to the west, and in Porpoise Bay and on the George V coast to the east. Vincennes Bay - which includes the Underwood, Bond, Adams, and Vanderford glaciers - has the most pronounced loss in ice mass. Elevation is dropping at five times the rate it was in 2008 - with a total fall in height over the period of almost 3m. ""They've also sped up about 3% from their 2008 velocity, which sounds small but is significant enough to change the flux coming out of those glaciers because they are very deep,"" said Dr Walker. Totten has long been recognised as the fastest moving glacier in East Antarctica Once again the melting culprit is likely to be warm water that is being pulled up from the deep by shifting sea-ice and wind patterns in the region. The changes that are occurring are still quite subtle, and they are only really discernible because of the new automated computer tools that will search through the millions of satellite images taken of Antarctica. Nasa is about to widen access to these tools through a project called Inter-mission Time Series of Land Ice Velocity and Elevation, or ITS_LIVE. ""I think we can anticipate that over the next five to 10 years, we're going to have a lot of observationally driven discoveries, such as what Catherine is making, because of the new data that's coming online,"" said Alex Gardner, a glaciologist with Nasa's Jet Propulsion Laboratory in Pasadena, California.

Macron concessions divide protest leaders,"This video can not be played President Macron says he is 'partly responsible' for the 'insufficient response' to the yellow vest protests A woman at the forefront of the ""yellow-vest"" protest movement in France has called for a ""truce"" in response to a series of concessions from President Emmanuel Macron. Jacline Mouraud said protesters couldn't ""spend the rest of our lives on roundabouts"". Other leaders have rejected his plans. Having already scrapped a fuel tax rise, Mr Macron promised an extra â¬100 (Â£90; $114) a month for minimum wage earners and tax cuts for pensioners. France has seen four weekends of violent protests from demonstrators known as gilets jaunes - or ""yellow vests"" - over fuel tax rises, living costs and other issues. French press weigh Macron's 'risky gamble' An opinion poll carried out in the wake of Mr Macron's speech,externalsuggested 59% of French people surveyed were unimpressed by his measures, while 40% were. By Hugh Schofield, BBC News, Paris Measures to defuse France's yellow-vest protests will cost â¬10bn (Â£9bn; $11bn), says Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire. That money will be offset by cuts in other government spending, he says. Mr Le Maire told British and American journalists that planned reforms remained on course despite the concessions and France would still honour deficit-to-GDP targets set by the EU. ""France's attractiveness (for investors) is at stake. That is why it is so important to maintain the path of reform,"" he said. ""We want to stick to our European commitments. We will do our best to reduce the level of public spending and be as close as possible to 3% in 2019."" Read more from Hugh:Spending cuts to fund Macron concessions The biggest promise was on the minimum wage, or ""Smic"", and affects 2.6 million people, according to the government. Initially described as a monthly increase in the Smic, it became clear that the government instead intended to speed up a planned increase in a supplement for minimum wage earners known as an ""activity premium"". That way, employers would not be taxed on the income. Other key concessions included: Cancelling a planned tax increase for pensioners on less than â¬2,000 a month Scrapping tax on overtime pay Removing tax from end-of-year bonuses for 2.3 million employees next week However, President Macron refused to reinstate a tax on the wealthy, saying ""this would weaken us, we need to create jobs"". Other reforms to pensions, unemployment benefit and public spending would go ahead as planned, he said. Prime Minister Edouard Philippe was set to spell out the proposals to the National Assembly on Tuesday, a week after he first suspended the fuel tax rise and then scrapped it altogether. France U-turn after fuel tax rise protests Police sources told French TV news channel BFMTV that 170 protests were still taking place on Tuesday, involving 45 road blockades and fewer than 2,000 people. The most receptive response to Mr Macron's speech came from Jacline Mouraud, 51, whose viral video complaining about fuel taxes is thought to have kick-started the yellow-vest movement. ""We now have to get out of this crisis,"" she said. An estimated 23 million French viewers watched Mr Macron's TV appearance on Monday night. Other protest leaders were more combative. Dozens of roads were still blocked on Tuesday as not every protest leader was impressed by Mr Macron's comments Maxime Nicolle, whose videos have been shared by protesters, said it was ""too little, too late"". Another key voice, Benjamin Cauchy, complained of the president's ""half measures"". ""â¬100 is all very well for minimum-wage types but what's in it for all the middle-earners struggling under enormous financial pressure?"" Employers' organisation Medef praised the measures, because they were focused on people's purchasing power but did not target businesses themselves. One of the president's key allies, Modem party leader Francois Bayrou, praised Mr Macron's proposals as a change of era, not merely for his presidency but in the context of the past 30 years. ""You can't have economic progress without social justice, if every citizen doesn't feel involved,"" he said. The protesters began as a grassroots French provincial movement with people donning high-visibility yellow jackets, which by law must be carried by every vehicle in France. Who are the 'gilets jaunes'? Will the environment be the true victim of France's riots? Who supports the protesters? Anger at planned fuel tax rises then included broader issues involving families struggle to make ends meet, with calls for higher wages, lower taxes, better pensions and easier university entry requirements. Big protests in central Paris turned violent, and there are calls for a fifth Saturday of protests on 15 December. 17 November:282,000 protesters - one dead, 409 wounded - 73 in custody 24 November:166,000 protesters - 84 wounded - 307 in custody 1 December:136,000 protesters - one dead, 263 wounded - 630 in custody 8 December:136,000 protesters - 118 wounded - 1,220 in custody Who are the 'gilets jaunes'?

Barclays introduces 'spending blocker',"Barclays has become the first High Street bank to allow its customers to ""switch off"" certain types of spending on their debit cards. The idea is to help vulnerable customers, particularly problem gamblers, or those in serious debt. However, all account holders can now block their own spending in a number of categories, including supermarkets, restaurants, pubs and petrol stations. It follows pressure from charities and money experts such as Martin Lewis. How a banking app stopped my gambling Customers are not able to block specific retailers, but instead can decide which categories of spending are allowed. These are: Groceries and supermarkets Restaurants, takeaways, pubs and bars Petrol stations Gambling - including websites, betting shops and lottery tickets Premium rate websites and phone lines, including TV voting, competitions and adult services Customers who want to select any of the categories above can do so via the Barclays app (see below). However, they will need to download the latest version of it. It is also possible to phone the bank, or go into a branch. For the moment, the tool only applies to spending on debit cards, although it should apply to credit cards at a later date. The idea was welcomed by Andy Gray, a former gambler from the West Midlands, who lost Â£100,000 in a single year. ""It's brilliant. It should be used in school. And every parent should be aware of it,"" he told the BBC. Although he used cash from his business to gamble when it was available, he would use a debit card whenever it wasn't. ""When I was not at work and needed to bet, I would resort to online debit card payments."" He said he would be using the app as soon as he could. While Barclays is the first major bank to operate this scheme, other online banks already offer similar blockers. The mobile bank Starling allows customers to block spending on gambling sites, or - unlike the Barclays tool - with specific retailers. Monzo, which introduced a similar tool in June, has reported a 70% decline in spending on gambling as a result. The idea has also been welcomed by some charities, as well as the Money Advice Trust. ""I believe it will make a real difference to people's lives and I hope the other banks will follow suit,"" said Martin Lewis, the founder of MoneySavingExpert.

Macron promises minimum wage rise,"This video can not be played President Macron says he is 'partly responsible' for the 'insufficient response' to the yellow vest protests France's President Emmanuel Macron has promised a minimum wage rise and tax concessions in response to weeks of violent protests. France has seen four weekends of violent protests against fuel tax rises, living costs and other issues. Speaking in a televised address, Mr Macron condemned the violence but said the protesters' anger was ""deep, and in many ways legitimate"". The minimum wage would increase by â¬100 per month from 2019, he said. A planned tax increase for low-income pensioners would be cancelled, overtime pay would no longer be taxed, and employers would be encouraged to pay a tax-free end of year bonus to employees, he added. However, he refused to reinstate a tax on the wealthy, saying ""this would weaken us, we need to create jobs"". Has Macron lost his charm? Why the 'yellow vests' won't stop protests Some protesters gathered to watch the president's speech The minimum wage will be increased by 7% - and the cost of this increase will be met by the government rather than employers. Government minister Olivier Dussopt told broadcaster BFMTV the total cost of all the measures is likely to be between â¬8bn and â¬10bn. ""We are in the process of fine-tuning and to see how to finance it,"" he added. Analysis by the BBC's Hugh Schofield in Paris They wanted more than just a politician's promises. They wanted measures, banknotes in their pockets, a tangible change in their impoverished daily lives. President Macron got the message. In fact he had no choice. To have blethered about future challenges and the need for nation-building would have driven the yellow vests to distraction. So here - at the core of the address - were four simple changes: a rise in the minimum wage; the removal of tax and social charges on overtime; encouragement to employers to give workers a tax-free bonus; and an end to a surcharge on most pensions. Plus a note of contrition, and a promise of a new ""national contract"" built on electoral change and wider consultation with the provinces. Chuck in the concessions already given - an end to the fuel tax rise and ""mobility"" grants for people who drive to work - and the yellow vests suddenly appear as one of the most successful protest movements of modern times. Four weeks after their first Facebook videos were posted, they have forced a total reorientation of French social and economic policy.  And without even making out a formal list of demands. Mr Macron, who has until now kept a low profile during the protests, acknowledged that many people were unhappy with living conditions and felt they ""had not been listened to"". He said that over the last 40 years there had been ""a malaise"" of ""villages and neighbourhoods where public services have been diminishing, where living conditions had deteriorated"". There were many ""people whose status in society had not been sufficiently well recognised. In a cowardly way, we had got used to it and everything seemed to suggest that we had forgotten them. ""I assume my share of the situation - I may have given you the feeling I have other concerns and priorities. I know some of you have been hurt by my words,"" he added. Mr Macron, a former banker, has previously been criticised for being out of touch and not listening to the struggles of ordinary people. He sought to change this impression on Monday, pledging to meet mayors from all the regions of France, and encourage ""unprecedented debate"". ""We must tackle the question of immigration,"" he added, while also urging the nation to come together to ""change in order to take into account climate change and other challenges"". The proposals were dismissed by one yellow vest protester, Benjamin Cauchy, who told France 2 TV: ""These are half measures. We feel that Macron has got a lot more to give."" His political opponents were also critical: left-wing leader Jean-Luc Melenchon said he expected more protests, right-wing politician Eric Woerth described the moves as a ""short-term"" solution, and far-right leader Marine Le Pen said Mr Macron had addressed some but not all of his mistakes. Meanwhile, a group of anti-racism NGOs, SOS Racisme, told Le Figaro newspaper they were concerned about Mr Macron's comments on immigration. 'Cross the road,' Macron tells jobseeker Macrons' new dinner plates spark cash row The protesters adopted the name after a social-media campaign urging people to take to the streets wearing the high-visibility yellow jackets that must be carried in every vehicle in France. They were initially protesting against a rise in duties on diesel, which is widely used by French motorists and has long been less heavily taxed than other types of fuel. Mr Macron had said higher taxes on fossil fuels were needed to fund renewable energy investments. Who are the 'gilets jaunes'? Will the environment be the true victim of France's riots? Who supports the protesters? But protests have also erupted over other issues, including calls for higher wages, lower taxes, better pensions and easier university entry requirements. The movement's core aim, to highlight the economic frustration and political distrust of poorer working families, has widespread support. 17 November:282,000 protesters - one dead, 409 wounded - 73 in custody 24 November:166,000 protesters - 84 wounded - 307 in custody 1 December:136,000 protesters - one dead, 263 wounded - 630 in custody 8 December:136,000 protesters - 118 wounded - 1,220 in custody Police fire tear gas.

Ex-altar boy sues church over rapes by priest,"This video can not be played Former altar boy Jim Lawn speaks out about priest abuse A former altar boy who claims he was raped dozens of times by a priest is suing the Catholic church. Jim Lawn told the BBC he was repeatedly raped and beaten over a two-year period in the 1970s by Father John Gowans at St Patrick's RC Church in Dumbarton. Mr Lawn, 54, said that when he initially approached the church about the abuse almost a decade ago it ignored him. The Catholic Church said its response to him had been ""simply unacceptable"". Jim was just eight when the abuse began The church said it was sorry for abuse that had happened and now had better safeguarding procedures in place. Mr Lawn said he was eight years old when the abuse began. He attended mass as an altar boy - once on a Sunday and again midweek. Mr Lawn said that on weekday mornings he was the only boy around and after the service Father Gowans, who died in 1999, would lead him to the sacristy - a private room for preparing mass. He would then be abused and beaten - before having to walk to his nearby primary school. Jim says he was abused for two years Mr Lawn said: ""He [Fr Gowans] took me into a toilet just off the corridor leading from the sacristy to the church. ""In a very short space of time it went from initial touching to a full attack. I was terrified and completely powerless to stop any of it. ""They nearly all happened like this and it happened nearly every week for two or three years."" Fr Gowans, believed to be in his 40s at the time of the abuse, is said to have taken steps to cover his tracks, such as locking doors. Mr Lawn added: ""He was very cold and organised about what he did. I knew what he was doing was wrong but I was simply too scared to tell anyone."" When Mr Lawn was 10 his father's work took him to Saudi Arabia for one year which brought an element of peace for him. But he suffered panic attacks, sleepless nights and the fear of noises or being left alone. The family returned to Dumbarton just before he started at St Aloysius' College in Glasgow. Shortly after arriving the family learned that Fr Gowans was moved to a diocese in Aberdeen. Father John Gowans was the priest at St Patrick's Church in Dumbarton Mr Lawn said that Fr Gowans told him he would ""burn in hell"" and that his relatives would die if he spoke of what was happening. He told the BBC: ""That was almost the worse thing because the shock of what was happening was one thing - the physical and mental shock of the assault - but the thought that people were going to die, that I would be responsible for that by telling anyone, was horrific."" Mr Lawn said: ""The hell thing, the burning thing, the imagery of that is still something that lives very strongly around in my head 45 years later."" He said he wanted to speak out to give others the confidence to do so too and because he wanted some sense of justice for himself and the child he was then. In 2009, Mr Lawns decided to report his complaints to the Scottish Catholic Safeguarding Service. He also emailed the Bishops' Conference. However, his initial inquiries received no response. In 2011 he eventually secured a meeting by phoning the Glasgow headquarters but claims the safeguarding service was more interested in who he had told than how he was coping. He has now decided to take matters further by suing the church. For many victims it can take decades or even longer to speak up about what has happened to them. In the past there was a strict three-year time limit on taking civil cases but last year the Scottish government removed that barrier for the victims of childhood abuse. Time bar on child abuse payouts lifted Kim Leslie, from law firm Digby Brown, said: ""It helps people because it gives them a voice. Kim Leslie, from law firm Digby Brown, said people felt they weren't going to be believed ""So often people felt they weren't going to be believed or that they just could not speak out. ""It was the silencing effect. ""In recognition of this the Scottish government has made this change in the law and so this is the time for people to come forward to seek help if they are ready."" The Catholic Church told the BBC the crimes described in the allegations were ""appalling"". A statement said it was ""truly sorry"" for what had happened to those who had suffered abuse. It said the ""lack of response"" given to Mr Lawn by the Church when he raised his concerns nine years ago and again seven years ago was ""simply unacceptable"". The church said in recent years it had invested in safeguarding, and today, anyone reporting abuse would be assisted to inform the police and would be offered independent counselling.

Six 'migrants' rescued from shipping lane,"This video can not be played The dinghy appeared to be taking in water as it approached the coast Fourteen migrants have been rescued from two dinghies in the Channel and brought ashore at Dover. Coastguards and a lifeboat crew were called at about 03:30 GMT to a small boat, in the Dover Strait - the world's busiest shipping lane. The Home Office said the boat contained five men and one woman, who claimed to be Iranian nationals. A second boat with eight men, all saying they were Iranian, was intercepted at about 12:00. More than 100 migrants, the majority of whom say they are Iranian, crossed the Channel towards Kent in November. Warnings have gone out from the UK authorities about the dangers of taking small boats on the Dover-Calais route. A Home Office spokesman said the coastguard contacted the Border Force in the early hours. A cutter and a lifeboat were sent to assist a dinghy with six people on board. They were brought back to Dover onboard the cutter. ""They received a medical assessment and have now been transferred to immigration officials for interview,"" he added. At about midday the coastguard reported a second boat off the coast of Dover with eight men on board. A Border Force cutter and coastal patrol vessel were sent to help a rigid-hulled inflatable boat (RHIB), The Home Office said. ""The men, who all presented themselves as Iranian nationals, have been brought to shore"", the spokesman said. The have been passed to the immigration service, he said. The six people on the boat claimed to be Iranian French border official Our greatest fear is, on the one hand, a collision that leads to a loss of human life and, what's more, an accident at sea that we need to assist with. On the other hand, our other fear is having injured people at sea and bodies on the beaches. We do not want it to come to that. Why are Iranians crossing the Channel in dinghies? The BBC has confirmed that at least 126 migrants haveentered British waters since 3 November, with the majority presenting themselves as Iranian. Miodrag ÄakiÄ, chief executive of Refugee Aid Serbia, which monitors migration through the Balkans, said Iranians heading for the UK had entered the EU via Serbia. Dangerous 'game'- Risking it all for a new life UK and France team to target border crime Toddler among nine rescued from dinghy He said they were among the thousands who flew into Serbia after the country began offering visa-free access to Iranians in August 2017 in a bid to increase tourism between the two countries. A spokeswoman for the Kent Refugee Action Network said the number of Iranians trying to enter the UK was unusually high. ""We haven't had this increase for some time. Iranians have always previously come in small numbers,"" she said. 11 December -Six people, thought to be from Iran were rescued from a small boat off the Kent coast. A second boat with eight men, all saying they were Iranian were picked up later the same day off Dover. 4 December -Two suspected migrants who said they were Iranian were picked up in an inflatable boat near St Margaret's Bay. 27 November -An18-month-old babywas among nine people rescued from a dinghy off Dover. 26 November- Nine people including a child, reported to be 18-months-old are picked up from a 3m-long boat off Dover. 25 November -Eight people, all suffering from hypothermia, arerescued by the French authoritiesfrom a small boat in the Channel 24 November -Five suspected migrants arepicked up from a small boatby the French authorities off northern France 23 November -Eight menlocated in a dinghyoff the coast of Dover 22 November -Thirteen men and one woman were interceptedin two dinghiesoff the coast of Dover 18 November -Nine suspected migrants were found clambering up rocks in Folkestone after apparentlycrossing the English Channel in a small boat 16 November -Seven suspected migrants were found offSamphire Hoe, near Dover 14 November -Nine suspected migrants - seven men, one woman and a toddler -  werefound off the Kent coast.

Three years ago the 27 year-old veterinary nurse collapsed at home, having returned from work. ""I said I felt faint, and when [my housemate] turned round to check on me, I was on the floor. She thought I was messing around at first."" Lora woke up in hospital confused, after three days in a coma Like many young people in her situation, Lora was not aware at the time that she had a serious heart condition. Her life was saved by the emergency services, and after three days in a coma she woke up in hospital. ""I was crying because I was so confused,"" she explains. Lora was diagnosed with something called Long QT syndrome - an inherited problem affecting the heart's rhythm, where the heart muscle takes longer to recharge between beats. ""At my age, I thought, 'No way.' I was 24 for goodness sake. ""You think of older people dropping dead because of frail hearts or heart disease, but not young people."" New research from the British Heart Foundation estimates 83,000 people aged 15 to 25 may have a faulty gene that puts them at an unusually high risk of developing heart disease or dying suddenly at a young age. Many of those people will never have any issues with their heart, but some will only discover they have got a problem when they suffer a cardiac arrest. Diagnosis rates are very low, so the vast majority of these anomalies will be undetected. Prof Behr is researching the genetic causes of heart attacks Prof Elijah Behr, a leading heart doctor at St George's, University of London, says that while inherited heart disorders are rare, ""when you add them together they actually add up to a significant number"". ""In fact, around 1,500 young people a year die suddenly in the UK from these inherited heart conditions. And that's the challenge - to identify those individuals and try to prevent those deaths,"" he adds. Prof Behr is now working to determine the genetic causes of heart attacks, and hopes the information can be used to prevent sudden deaths in future. Some doctors feel that mandatory screening for young people would help catch these conditions earlier, but others say more research needs to be done before it could be introduced. Dan Wilkinson, with his father Barry In 2016, Barry and Gill Wilkinson's son Dan Wilkinson died after collapsing playing football. He was aged 24 at the time and had lived an active lifestyle, having previously played for Hull City's youth team. ""He had a serious heart issue, but there was nothing to tell him, or us, that there was something wrong,"" his father reflects. ""Twenty-four hours before, we had FaceTimed and he was his usual self."" Dan had a condition known as ARVC (Arrhythmogenic right ventricular cardiomyopathy), which weakens the wall of the heart and can lead to a cardiac arrest. He collapsed during the second half while playing for non-league side Shaw Lane AFC. Dan had previously played for Hull City's youth team ""My phone went and it was one of his team-mates,"" Barry remembers. ""They said Dan had collapsed, would we be able to get there?"" By the time they did, he had died. ""You just go into shock,"" his mother Gill says. Barry tries to stifle the tears as the couple discuss how they wish they could have told him they loved him one final time. They have now started a charity, through which they have bought defibrillators for grassroots football clubs. One has since been used to save the life of a 14-year-old boy playing for his local team in Yorkshire. Lora hopes that she can make a difference by speaking publicly about her own experiences. ""I really want young people to be aware that this could happen to them. Heart disease doesn't discriminate,"" she says. She has been fitted with a defibrillator and pacemaker in her chest, which may one day be called upon to save her life. But for now, she says she is trying to make the most of every day. ""I say 'yes' to the random outings my friends invite me to, because I never know if or when it could happen again and kill me this time. ""I just live life to the fullest now,"" she adds, ""I'm lucky to be alive."" Follow the Victoria Derbyshire programme onFacebook,externalandTwitter,external- and see more of our storieshere.

Gary Thompson, who was appointed to his current role in 2016, has worked for the NIFRS for more than 20 years. In a statement, the NIFRS said his precautionary suspension had taken place with immediate effect. It added that precautionary suspension ""is a neutral action in line with NIFRS policies and procedures"". NIFRS said it was ""not in a position to make any further comment at this time"". ""The NIFRS board, in conjunction with Department of Health, will now consider and put in place interim arrangements to ensure the continued delivery of our service to the public,"" it added. Last month, the BBC's Spotlight programme claimed that Gary Thompson had been involved in a failed property investment scheme which fire fighters had been encouraged to invest in. The fire service has not said whether the suspension is connected in any way with Spotlight's programme.

LiveMPs debate Brexit plans,"Debate on reconciliation in foreign policy and international development Georgina Pattinson Feeling a little lost about what's going on with Brexit? Here's our basic guide. Cancel Brexit, hand the decision to backbenchers or members of the public - or get the Queen involved? Thanks for joining us for today's debate. We'll be back on Monday at 2.30pm for the last week in Westminster before the Christmas recess. Debate on reconciliation House of LordsParliament The Most Revd Justin Welby, the Archbishop of Canterbury, points to contributions in the debate, and he says one phrase that stuck with him was ""costly forgiveness"". Another point that has come out of the debate is the importance of values, which ""give real authority"" to our interventions, he says. Debate on reconciliation House of LordsParliament Defence Minister Earl Howe says that reconciliation is a vital part of ending conflict and also preventing a relapse into conflict. What the debate has highlighted is that the government needs to do more with civil society, supporting grass roots figures such as church leaders and those in the private sector - and he points to the work of the British Council. He says the government must collaborate more closely with international partners to prevent conflict. But peacekeeping is becoming more dangerous, he says. He says the aid budget is designed to tackle great global challenges, including migration and terrorism, as well as climate change. Debate on reconciliation House of LordsParliament Labour's Lord Collins of Highbury says the US president Donald Trump's tweets have been increasingly inflammatory, and they have impact beyond the US's borders. The maintenance of a rules-based international order has been tough in the face of challenges, he says. ""We need to do a better job of making the case than we have in the past,"" Lord Collins says. That includes supporting the UN, Nato and the World Trade Organisation. The Labour party would support a renewed commitment to internationalism, he says, developing sanctions and soft power as a response. Debate on reconciliation House of LordsParliament Lib Dem Lord Alderdice says the debate has included moving contributions. He says there is an important role for the Ministry of Defence and the armed forces; as well as the Department for International Development. But if ""it's not done in the right way"", he says, things go wrong. He cites Northern Ireland, saying money was put in there but it led to ""upwardly mobile terrorists"". The PM says her Brexit deal is ""at risk"", as her performance at an EU summit is called ""bad"" by diplomats. Debate on reconciliation House of LordsParliament Lord Jay of Ewelme, a crossbench or independent peer, and a former ambassador to France, says it is possible to conduct a foreign policy based on self interest. But he says if the UK seeks to follow moral values abroad, then those need to apply at home too. Debate on reconciliation House of LordsParliament Reconciliation in conflict zones is a necessary condition for lasting peace, Conservative peer Baroness Brady says. She says it is apposite that today's debate is called by the Archbishop of Canterbury, she says, because often faith-based organisations are all that is left in conflict areas. She says, though, that she doesn't believe it is right for the UK government to be involved. It is difficult to justify using taxpayers' money in such instances, and often there is a low chance of success, she says. The UK government should act but it is the armed forces who should be involved to bring about peace - and it is then that international development agencies and NGOs should be involved. She calls for the international aid budget to be repurposed to the defence budget and the UK's commitment to Nato. Debate on reconciliation House of LordsParliament Conservative peer Lord Trimble is the next peer to speak. Lord Trimble was the first First Minister of Northern Ireland, from 1998 to 2002 and the leader of the Ulster Unionist Party. He was instrumental in the party's acceptance of the Good Friday Agreement. He says he recognises the phrase ""bottom up"" when it comes to reconciliation - attempts to resolve the problems in Northern Ireland failed because they were not based in the local communities. Lord Trimble says he believes that although the two main parties in Northern Ireland today - the DUP and Sinn Fein - have fallen out, leading to the suspension of the Northern Ireland Assembly, he has ""no doubt"" that will be resolved.

Debate on reconciliation House of LordsParliament The Archbishop says the week past has been a week of deep division and although the debate focuses on foreign affairs, it could apply to the UK. He tells peers that at the heart of the church, is reconciliation. In a human world, ""disagreeing well"" is crucial, and says this is a theme he will return to. Welcome to our coverage of today in the House of Lords. The Archbishop of Canterbury has tabled today's debate on the role of reconciliation in British foreign, defence and international development policy. One Police and Crime Commissioner says it is still not enough, as crime rises. The Lords debate on young people finishes - they will now hear a repeat of the statement in the Commons earlier on police funding. However that's where we leave our coverage of Parliament for today. MPs are back in the Commons next Monday - do join us then. Challenges facing young people House of LordsParliament Education Minister Lord Agnew of Oulton says the government has committed Â£70m for careers advisers in schools, which he calls an ""extremely important priority"". The government is delivering a ""manifesto commitment"" to address ""poor outcomes"" for children in need of ""help and protection"", he says. ""Bullying can come in many forms,"" he says, adding that it is no longer confined to the classroom. He adds that the number of people on zero-hour contracts is down on previous years. Challenges facing young people House of LordsParliament Labour's Lord Griffiths of Burry Port says young person with ""splendid A levels"" recently told him he didn't want to go to university because becoming a lawyer ""takes too long"" and there are too many obstacles for black people. Lord Griffiths said he told him there was too much quick money to be made in crime, football, drugs and fame. He says universities often insist their admissions processes are ""egalitarian"", but he adds they are ""anything but"". House of CommonsParliament The debate on a public health approach to youth violence has now ended. The last item of business tonight is a short adjournment debate on rural post offices, led by Tory MP Derek Thomas. Challenges facing young people House of LordsParliament Liberal Democrat education spokesman Lord Storey says four out of five people under the age of 13 have a social media presence. ""We cannot put the internet genie back in the bottle,"" he says, advocating education on using the internet rather than restricting it. He says that local support services for young people have been reduced by government cuts. Â© 2025 BBC.

Man held by armed police at UK ParliamentA man is held by armed officers in an incident inside the grounds of Parliament.UK,"This video can not be played The BBC's Laura Kuenssberg witnessed the man being pinned to the ground by police A man has been arrested by armed police officers after it is believed he broke into the grounds of Parliament. An eyewitness told the BBC the man jumped over railings before being Tasered by police. The man was held within the parliamentary courtyard but has now been taken away in a police van. Police say he has been arrested on suspicion of trespassing at a protected site and is now being investigated by the Met's counter terrorism command. The Metropolitan Police said the man ran towards officers and a Taser was used when he did not comply with their requests to stop. He is to undergo a mental health assessment, police said. Parliamentary authorities say the incident, which happened just before midday on Tuesday, is contained. Police Taser the man The man is then arrested on suspicion of trespassing at a protected site Christopher Hope, a reporter for the Daily Telegraph, told BBC News: ""I heard a scream and then looked out the window, and then about half a dozen police officers who appeared not to be armed were running towards a man. ""And then it appears the man was Tasered. ""It appears to be contained now. There are armed police patrolling downstairs by the Christmas tree."" BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg, who also witnessed the disturbance, says she saw the man on the ground, arguing and shouting at police. Police gathered up his belongings, including what looked like a passport, before bundling him into the back of a police van, she added. The incident, which is still in the very early stages of being investigated, happened in the same area inside Parliament's grounds as last year's terror attack. PC Keith Palmer, who was guarding the gates, was stabbed and killed by Khalid Masood, moments after he had knocked down pedestrians indiscriminately on Westminster Bridge, killing four people.

Nuns admit stealing cash for Vegas trip,"Two nuns who worked at a Catholic school in California have admitted embezzling about $500,000 (Â£396,000) and using it to gamble in Las Vegas. Sisters Mary Kreuper and Lana Chang took the money from St James' Catholic School in the city of Torrance, near Los Angeles, to spend in casinos. The pair, who are said to be best friends, took funds from an account holding tuition fees and donations. The sisters, who recently retired, have expressed remorse for their actions. Mary Kreuper was the school principal for 29 years, while Lana Chang worked as a teacher for about 20 years. They are thought to have stolen the money over a period of at least a decade to spend on travel and gambling. Pope warns nuns to use 'sobriety' on social media On Monday, St James' Catholic Church said the nuns had expressed ""deep remorse"" over their actions, adding that while the police had been informed, no criminal charges would be brought against the pair. ""The Sisters have confirmed the misappropriation of funds and have co-operated in the investigation,external,"" the sisters' order, the Sisters of St Joseph of Carondelet, said in a statement on its website. ""Our community is concerned and saddened by this situation and regret any injury to our long relationship with the families of the school,"" it added. The priest of the church, Monsignor Michael Meyers, wrote in a letter to parishioners: ""Sister Mary Margaret and Sister Lana have expressed to me and asked that I convey to you, the deep remorse they each feel for their actions and ask for your forgiveness and prayers."" The Archdiocese of Los Angeles said the church discovered that the money was missing during a routine audit. The nuns were allegedly able to conceal their actions by depositing a number of cheques made out to the school for tuition and other fees into a separate bank account not used by the school. Parents were reportedly informed about the findings earlier this month.

Blast widower 'still hears wife's cries',"Two homes wrecked and about 50 were damaged in the blast A man whose wife died after their house exploded a year ago said he has flashbacks of her crying ""get me out"" while he was stuck under rubble. Janet Jasper, 79, died in hospitalafter the blast, which happened whena cooker spark ignited leaking gas. About 50 homes in Birstall, Leicestershire, were damaged in the explosion on 11 December 2017. John Jasper, 81, who had lived with his wife in the house since the 1960s, said it had been the ""worst year ever"". This video can not be played Aerial footage shows Birstall blast wreckage Mr Jasper said: ""When they found me under the plaster board I looked back at what was left of my house and I just couldn't believe I had come out of that house virtually unscathed. ""I realised I'd got nothing. I was devastated. Everything we had lived for - 56 years there - had just gone up in one big bang."" John Jasper said it was a ""nightmare"" trying to piece his life back together again ""because everything had been destroyed"" Mr Jasper, pictured with Janet on their wedding day, said it was hard to comprehend one minute having everything, ""then suddenly you have nothing at all"" Mr Jasper said the main flashback he had was of his wife calling for help. ""The bit that upset me is the fact that I could hear my wife crying 'get me out, get me out' and I couldn't move. That is the main flashback so I try not to dwell on that."" The two collapsed houses before and after Mr and Mrs Jasper's house in Allington Drive and the one next door were both wrecked in the explosion - as well as dozens of others being damaged. As well as losing his wife, his home and all his belongings, Mr Jasper - who now lives in a bungalow - and his son Anthony have both suffered health problems since. He said: ""It's been pretty bad, complete with having a stroke and recovering from that. ""It's probably been the worst year. Then Anthony has been diagnosed with a lymphoma. It is one thing after the other. It has been an awful year."" John Jasper said Birstall Parish Council was planning to create a garden of remembrance for Janet A ""catastrophic failure of an internal gas pipe joint"" was the source of the leak The fire service ruled out a criminal investigation and said they found ""a catastrophic failure of an internal gas pipe joint"" under the kitchen floor was the source of the leak. The gas maintenance company Cadent said: ""We attended Mr Jasper's home the day before the incident. Our engineer carried out tests using specialist gas detection equipment and based on the results of these tests, no further action was required."" The Health and Safety Executive (HSE) has distributed leaflets to residents explaining that the cause of the blast was a failed gas pipe from the empty house next door to the Jaspers. ""We believe the pipe failed as a result of the ground beneath the concrete floor moving and sinking and affecting the pipe's integrity,"" it said. ""A number of other factors also contributed, and without them we don't believe the incident would have happened."" In the leaflet, the HSE said the risk of this happening at another house was ""extremely low"" and it only knows of ""two such occurrences in the whole of the UK in the post-war era"". A HSE spokeswoman said their investigation was complete and the coroner had a copy of the report to assist with the inquest, likely to take place during 2019. Janet Jasper died in hospital after a cooker spark ignited the explosion Pat Clafton was the last resident to return to Allington Drive a few weeks ago and said it was ""wonderful to be home"". She said: ""This is where I have lived for 50 years nearly. The house is different but when I look out of the windows it is the same. ""The house is very different because everything in it has changed - not a lot could be salvaged. But I look out the windows and I am home.""

Refugee footballer fights extradition,"Mr Al-Araibi claims he will be tortured if extradited to Bahrain A Bahraini footballer is facing extradition from Thailand, despite international calls for his release. Hakeem Al-Araibi, 25, who holds refugee status in Australia, was detained in Bangkok last month on an Interpol warrant put out by Bahrain. He was sentenced in Bahrain for vandalism but denies the charges. Australia, football's governing body Fifa and rights groups have condemned his arrest as there are fears for his safety if he is sent back to Bahrain. Mr Al-Araibi claims he will be tortured if extradited. The footballer fled to Australia in 2014 where he was granted political asylum last year and plays for Melbourne football club Pascoe Vale. He was on a holiday in Thailand when authorities detained him at a Bangkok airport on 27 November. On Tuesday he appeared at a Bangkok court where his detention was extended for 60 days. He was denied bail. ""I don't want to go back to Bahrain - I want to go back to Australia. I didn't do anything in Bahrain. I'm a refugee in Australia,"" he told reporters as he was led into court. In 2014, Hakeem Al-Araibi was sentenced in absentia in Bahrain to 10 years in prison for vandalising a police station. His home country's embassy in Thailand said on Twitter the footballer was wanted ""for security cases"". The former member of Bahrain's national soccer team denies all allegations. ""If I am deported to Bahrain, don't forget me, and if once I'm there you hear me saying things, don't believe me,"" he wrote on Facebook last week. ""I know what will happen to me and I know I will be tortured to confess things that I have never done."" From mud hut to international goalscorer Nairobi to Liverpool: Finding a new life through football Mr Al-Araibi told Human Rights Watch (HRW) that if sent back to Bahrain his life would be in danger and that he had already been tortured there following Arab Spring protests in 2012. He has been a vocal critic of Bahraini authorities and HRW says he is also targeted because of his brother's political activism. Australia says it is in high level diplomatic talks with Thailand,external, seeking the football player's safe return. Foreign Minister Marise Payne said her country was ""concerned by the ongoing detention of Mr Hakeem Al-Araibi and calls for his immediate return to Australia"". Australia's Football Federation and international governing body Fifa have both also called for his release. Melbourne clubPascoe Vale sent an open letter to the Thai prime minister,externalasking for their player to be protected ""as a recognised refugee in Australia"". ""He should not be forcibly returned to Bahrain, a country from which he has escaped persecution and fears return,"" the letter urges. The club also posted a video message from the player speaking from his detention cell in Bangkok. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Human Rights Watch Asia Director Brad Adams said Thailand needed to realise ""the grave dangers facing"" the football player if returned to Bahrain. Thailand does not have an extradition treaty with Bahrain which would regulate conditions of when and how an alleged criminal could be handed over. Yet even without such a treaty, countries can request a wanted citizen to be extradited. Rights groups though point out that in the current case there are international rules that should bar Bangkok from handing over a person if they might be tortured. HRW's Asia Deputy Director Phil Robertson said on Twitter that warrants like the one used in the current case, ""do NOT apply to recognized #refugees like Hakeem al-Araibi"". Allow Twitter content?

London-based Bahrain Institute for Rights and Democracy warned that Thailand would breach international law if it was to extradite the football player. ""Extraditing registered refugees and returning them to territories where they would face a real risk of persecution, torture, or other ill-treatment violates Thailand's obligations under international law, including the UN Convention Against Torture,"" the rights group said in a statement. According to Amnesty International, Thailand in 2014 extradited a 21-year old man to Bahrain in response to an Interpol warrant.

Puzzle solving 'won't stop mental decline',"Doing crossword puzzles and Sudoku does not appear to protect against mental decline, according to a new study. The idea of ""use it or lose it"" when it comes to our brains in later life has previously been widely accepted. The new Scottish study showed that people who regularly do intellectual activities throughout life have higher mental abilities. This provides a ""higher cognitive point"" from which to decline, say the researchers. But the study did not show that they decline any slower. Thework, published in the BMJ,,externalwas undertaken by Dr Roger Staff at Aberdeen Royal Infirmary and the University of Aberdeen. It looked at 498 people born in 1936 who had taken part in a group intelligence test at the age of 11. This current study started when they were about 64 years old and they were recalled for memory and mental-processing-speed testing up to five times over a 15-year period. It found engagement in problem solving did not protect an individual from decline. However, engaging in intellectually stimulating activities on a regular basis was linked to level of mental ability in old age. The study uses modelling to look at associations and cannot prove any causal link. Also, many of the participants were unable to complete the whole study - some dropped out, others died. Previously, some studieshave found that cognitive training can improve some aspects of memory and thinking, particularly for people who are middle-aged or older. They found so-called brain training may help older people to manage their daily tasks better. No studies have shown that brain training prevents dementia. And last yeara reportfrom the Global Council on Brain Health recommended that people should take part in stimulating activities such as learning a musical instrument, designing a quilt or gardening rather than brain training to help their brain function in later life. It said the younger a person started these activities, the better their brain function would be as they aged. Dr Staff and colleagues say even though their study did not find puzzles counteracted mental decline, it doesn't mean they are a waste of time. Dr David Reynolds, chief scientific officer at Alzheimer's Research UK, said the research added to the ""ongoing 'use it or lose it' debate"". But as the research did not consider people with dementia, ""we can't say from these results whether specific brain training activities could impact a person's risk of the condition"". ""In addition to staying mentally active, keeping physically fit, eating a healthy balanced diet, not smoking, drinking within recommended guidelines and keeping weight, cholesterol and blood pressure in check are all good ways to support a healthy brain as we get older."" Dr James Pickett, Head of Research at Alzheimer's Society, said: ""Although playing 'brain games' such as Sudoku may not prevent dementia, is has been shown that regularly challenging yourself mentally seems to build up the brain's ability to cope with disease.""

Losses widen at Carpetright as sales fall,"Struggling floor covering retailer Carpetright said half-year losses widened sharply to Â£11.7m from Â£0.6m last time. Same store sales fell by 12.7% over the six-month period but the company said there was a ""marked sequential improvement"" between the quarters. The company also said net debt had dropped from Â£53m to Â£12.4m. Earlier this year the company agreed a rescue plan, which included the closure of 81 stores. So far, 65 of these have been closed. Carpetright chief executive Wilf Walsh said: ""This is a transitional year for Carpetright as we work through our restructuring plan.  We remain on schedule and are confident that this activity is already starting to yield benefits. ""This is the first stage in returning the group to sustainable long term profitability."" Investors in early trading appeared to see the positive, too. Shares were 4% higher in early trading. Neil Wilson, from markets.com, said there were some ""encouraging signs"" in Carpetright's results. ""It's on course to deliver the Â£19m in annualised cost savings from the store closure programme,"" he said. ""Investors may also be encouraged that the average store lease has been reduced to 3.5 years, with more than half able to break within two years,"" Mr Wilson added. The company agreed a Company Voluntary Arrangement (CVA) with its creditors in April. Under that plan it also raised Â£65m from shareholders. Carpetright has recently had to face fresh competition from rival Tapi. But Mr Wilson said that Carpetright was still dominant in terms of market share and brand recognition. Carpetright's troubles come as many others on the High Street struggle to stay in business. This year has seen a raft of big names shut stores or disappear entirely. They include electronics firm Maplin, House of Fraser, Debenhams, Toys R Us, Mothercare and even Poundworld. A number of big-name restaurant chains have also struggled, including Jamie's Italian and Prezzo. Mike Ashley: Who is the founder of Sports Direct?

Wages rise at fastest pace for decadeAverage weekly earnings for UK workers saw the biggest rise since November 2008.BusinessComments,"Wages are continuing to rise at their highest level for nearly a decade,the latest official Office for National Statistics figures show.,external Compared with a year earlier, wages excluding bonuses, were up by 3.3% for the three months to October, the biggest rise since November 2008. Average weekly wages are Â£495 - the highest since 2011, when adjusted for inflation. The number of people in work rose by 79,000 to 32.48 million, a record high. That is the highest figure since records began in 1971. Unemployment increased by 20,000 to 1.38 million, although the margin of error is 70,000 and the total is still lower than a year ago. The number of unemployed men increased by 27,000, while the number of unemployed women fell by 8,000. The reason both employment and unemployment have increased is a result of the UK's rising population and more people joining the labour force, such as students and older people. Job vacancies were up by 10,000 on the quarter to a record high of 848,000. More than half, 195,000, of the 329,000 jobs created in the year to October went to people who are no longer economically inactive, who are the main reason for the expansion in the workforce There are fewer students, people who are not working because of caring responsibilities, long-term sick and retired people in the 16 to 64 age group than a year ago. Minimum wage rises 'hit profits, not jobs' London dominates UK jobs growth over past decade Firms 'struggling to recruit as overseas staff stay away' ""Real earnings are now growing faster than at any time since around the end of 2016,"" said the ONS senior statistician Matt Hughes. Employment Minister Alok Sharma said: ""Today's statistics show the enduring strength of our jobs market, with wages outpacing inflation for the ninth month in a row and employment at a record high."" Shadow work and pensions secretary Margaret Greenwood said: ""The reality behind these figures is that the number of people in work in poverty is rising faster than employment. Real wages are still lower than they were 10 years ago."" Fears that the labour market is tightening were expressed by the CBI's Matthew Percival and Suren Thiru, of the British Chambers of Commerce, Mr Percival said this was shown by ""a record employment rate and a rising number of jobs that can't be filled"". He added: ""While pay growth is improving at its fastest and most sustained rate in a decade, this is still slower than the UK has achieved in the past."" Mr Thiru blamed ""the second successive rise in unemployment, coupled with a decline in the number of people who are not seeking work"" for the labour market's contraction. ""Businesses report that the political and economic turbulence, together with significant difficulties finding the right staff, are diminishing recruitment intentions, which is likely to increasingly weigh on the UK labour market over the near term,"" he added. TUC general secretary Frances O'Grady said: ""The rise in pay growth is little consolation for workers in the middle of the longest pay squeeze in 200 years, with real wages expected only to get back to pre-crisis level in 2024. We need a plan that supports jobs and wages."" Howard Archer, chief economic adviser to the EY Item Club, said: ""Current decent employment may be influenced by companies being keen to employ while they can, given the increased concern in some sectors over a lack of suitably skilled candidates. ""In some cases this has been significantly influenced by fewer workers coming from the EU,"" he said. In a note, analysts Capital Economics said: ""The latest labour market figures suggest that a recovery in real pay growth is taking root. This supports our view that GDP growth will rebound next year if a 'no-deal' Brexit is avoided. ""Admittedly, there have been false dawns in the past few years. But we think that the recent recovery in real earnings growth will probably be sustained."" Stephen Clarke, of the Resolution Foundation think tank, said: ""While Brexit uncertainty and political paralysis are having a cooling effect on the wider economy, the labour market is proving more resilient."" He added that pay should improve in 2019, but warned: ""After a pretty appalling decade, Britain remains some way off a return to the levels of real pay we enjoyed before the crash.""

"Six 'migrants' rescued from shipping laneA lifeboat crew was called to a boat six miles off the Kent coast, in the in the Dover Strait.Kent","This video can not be played The dinghy appeared to be taking in water as it approached the coast Fourteen migrants have been rescued from two dinghies in the Channel and brought ashore at Dover. Coastguards and a lifeboat crew were called at about 03:30 GMT to a small boat, in the Dover Strait - the world's busiest shipping lane. The Home Office said the boat contained five men and one woman, who claimed to be Iranian nationals. A second boat with eight men, all saying they were Iranian, was intercepted at about 12:00. More than 100 migrants, the majority of whom say they are Iranian, crossed the Channel towards Kent in November. Warnings have gone out from the UK authorities about the dangers of taking small boats on the Dover-Calais route. A Home Office spokesman said the coastguard contacted the Border Force in the early hours. A cutter and a lifeboat were sent to assist a dinghy with six people on board. They were brought back to Dover onboard the cutter. ""They received a medical assessment and have now been transferred to immigration officials for interview,"" he added. At about midday the coastguard reported a second boat off the coast of Dover with eight men on board. A Border Force cutter and coastal patrol vessel were sent to help a rigid-hulled inflatable boat (RHIB), The Home Office said. ""The men, who all presented themselves as Iranian nationals, have been brought to shore"", the spokesman said. The have been passed to the immigration service, he said. The six people on the boat claimed to be Iranian French border official Our greatest fear is, on the one hand, a collision that leads to a loss of human life and, what's more, an accident at sea that we need to assist with. On the other hand, our other fear is having injured people at sea and bodies on the beaches. We do not want it to come to that. Why are Iranians crossing the Channel in dinghies? The BBC has confirmed that at least 126 migrants haveentered British waters since 3 November, with the majority presenting themselves as Iranian. Miodrag ÄakiÄ, chief executive of Refugee Aid Serbia, which monitors migration through the Balkans, said Iranians heading for the UK had entered the EU via Serbia. Dangerous 'game'- Risking it all for a new life UK and France team to target border crime Toddler among nine rescued from dinghy He said they were among the thousands who flew into Serbia after the country began offering visa-free access to Iranians in August 2017 in a bid to increase tourism between the two countries.

Final day for First Minister Carwyn Jones,"Carwyn Jones served as Welsh first minister from 2009 Political rivals and allies of Carwyn Jones have paid tribute to the outgoing first minister. But Welsh Government junior minister Huw Irranca-Davies said the death of former minister Carl Sargeant last year had cast a ""cloud"" over Mr Jones's departure. He and former minister Jane Hutt praised his legacy, but an opposition Tory AM suggested Mr Jones's government suffered ""missed opportunities"". The Welsh Labour leader announced his intention to stand down from the post of first minister last April, saying he had been through the""darkest of times"". Behind-the-scenes of Carwyn Jones' during his final months Carwyn Jones profile This video can not be played 'In this job sometimes things get very difficult. That doesn't mean you should run away from them', he said Carwyn Jones has been on the assembly's political scene since the beginning of devolution in 1999, when he was elected to become AM for Bridgend at the age of 32. He served in a range of cabinet jobs under his predecessor Rhodri Morgan, including as minister for agriculture and counsel general. He succeeded Mr Morgan as the party leader and first minister in 2009,external, keeping his party in Welsh Government after elections in 2011 and 2016, albeit with a minority in the assembly. Politics expert Roger Awan-Scully said Mr Jones will be a ""hard act to follow"" as an election leader. Carwyn Jones pictured with former Welsh Secretary Stephen Crabb, former US President Barack Obama, and former UK Prime Minister David Cameron at the NATO summit in Newport in 2014 (L-R) ""In 2016, amidst a very difficult context for the party across the UK, and with the Scottish party sinking into third place in the Scottish parliament, he limited Labour's losses to one seat,"" he said. ""And last year in a general election that was initially looking catastrophic for the Labour party, he stepped forward, he became front and centre of the Labour campaign in Wales."" The Cardiff University professor said Mr Jones would like to be remembered as someone ""who governed in a difficult time, and hopefully minimised the extent to which falling budgets impact negatively on major public services"". ""His critics would talk about a lack of improvement in health, in education, in economic development"", he said. Carl Sargeant was found dead last year, days after Carwyn Jones sacked him amid allegations of inappropriate behaviour The death of Carl Sargeant shaped the timing and context of his departure, said Prof Awan-Scully. Mr Sargeant was found dead at his home November 2017, days after Mr Jones fired him from his cabinet post amid allegations of inappropriate behaviour. Drakeford set to be Walesâ first minister Who is Mark Drakeford? Prof Awan-Scully said: ""It's clearly brought about a way of ending his time as first minister that would he not want, but nobody would have wanted. ""Even his strongest critics would not have wanted him to leave the job in this way."" Carwyn Jones stood outside Downing Street after talks with Theresa May Huw Irranca-Davies, who is children's, older people and social care minister in Carwyn Jones's government, said: ""I think the tragic circumstances under which Carwyn is leaving the post, and it's a tragedy for Carl's family... I think it does cast a cloud over Carwyn's departure."" The minister, who was an MP before joining the assembly in 2016 and had supported Mr Jones's bid for the leadership, said: ""I think his legacy will be far longer reaching than the tragedy of Carl."" If Mr Morgan's legacy was the bedding down of the early assembly and Welsh Government ""Carwyn's legacy has been to take it on to a new level,"" Mr Irranca-Davies said. ""A more muscular government, a more outspoken government. ""If you look at the major reforms around curriculum development in Wales, so we not only have the highest standards of education attainment but well rounded individuals who come out of our education system, if you look at reforms in health and social care even in challenging times we are leading the UK in trying to develop a system that is seamless health and social care."" Carwyn Jones had led Labour back into government in Wales at two elections Plaid Cymru leader Adam Price said he would have done ""pretty much everything"" differently to Carwyn Jones. ""Carwyn's strengths were on the constitutional side of things, where he felt most comfortable, and where you detected a genuine depth of knowledge and sense of enthusiasm,"" he said. But he said in other areas of public policy like health and education ""there wasn't a big idea"". He said in education Wales was now worse off than pre-devolution. ""What has there been that Carwyn can really point to in terms of transformative policy ideas, that have been implemented? I see competitively little,"" he said. But he said the AM is a ""very decent person"" and his criticism is ""more in sorrow than in anger"". ""There's a bit of a Teflon aspect to this FM"", he said, praising his resilience. Former Welsh Conservative leader Andrew RT Davies said the outgoing first minister ""was always someone who never carried a grudge outside the chamber"", the South Wales Central AM said. But he listed Mr Jones's ""missed opportunities"" in policy - citing proposals for local government mergers that never came to fruition, and the decision over the M4 Relief Road which Mr Jones was not able to take himself. He pointed to PISA education rankings,which in 2016 put Wales below other UK nations. They ""clearly show we haven't made the improvements that were promised by successive education ministers that Carwyn appointed"", said Mr Davies. Mr Jones told BBC Wales: ""Whenever you leave a period of leadership there are bound to be things still to do."" The 2010 Ryder Cup took place while Carwyn Jones was first minister Mr Jones on Monday cited reforms which introduced a soft-opt out system for organ donation as his biggest achievement. ""People are literally alive because of that legislation,"" he said. Jane Hutt, the Labour AM for the Vale of Glamorgan, served as a minister in Mr Jones's cabinet up until the cabinet reshuffle of late 2017. Mr Jones was first minister when a referendum was held on giving the assembly more law making powers. That was a ""major achievement"", Ms Hutt said, ""because it led to us being able to take through pioneering legislation like the organ donation human transplantation act"". She also praised his decision to buy Cardiff Airport in 2012, calling it a ""brave"" move that ""paid off"". Who is Welsh Labour leader Mark Drakeford?

Palu tsunami clue found on seafloor,"The tsunami came ashore within three minutes of the quake Scientists are getting closer to understanding the tsunami that struck Palu in Indonesia in September. Damaging waves rushed ashore after a Magnitude 7.8 quake, but researchers said at the time that they were surprised by their size. Now, a survey in the bay in front of the Sulawesi city shows significant subsidence of the seabed. This likely contributed to the abrupt displacement of water that then crashed on to land. More than 2,000 people lost their lives in the disaster. Preliminary results ofvarious investigations are being reported here at the Fall Meeting of the American Geophysical Union,external- the largest annual gathering of Earth and space scientists. The quake occurred on what is called a strike-slip fault, where the ground on one side of a rupture moves horizontally past the ground on the other side. It is not a configuration normally associated with very large tsunamis. Nevertheless, this is what happenedin the early evening of 28 September, around prayer time. Two main surges of water were observed, the second being the biggest and pushing up to 400m inland. Udrekh Al Hanif, from the Indonesian Agency for Assessment and Application of Technology (BPPT) in Jakarta, told the meeting that the generation source of the tsunami had to be very close to the city because of the short interval between the onset of the quake and the arrival of the high water - less than three minutes. Scientists have sought answers on the bay floor He and colleagues have sought answers in a depth (bathymetric) map of the long, narrow inlet that leads to Palu at its head. The team is still working through the results, but the data indicates the seafloor in much of the bay dropped down in the quake. This, combined with a sharp movement of the crust northwards, could certainly have produced a tsunami, the Indonesian scientist said. ""When we overlap the bathymetric data from before and after, we can see that almost all of the area of the seafloor inside the bay subsides. And from this data, we can also observe [the movement] to the north. So, actually, we have a vertical and a horizontal displacement,"" Udrekh Al Hanif told BBC News. Looking south down the bay towards Palu: The seafloor dropped in response to the quake Whether this behaviour was enough on its own to explain the tsunami's size is still open to question. There is evidence of several underwater landslides in the data. These, too, could have been a factor. How my child lost in Palu came back from the dead Palu hit by 'worst case scenario' tsunami Aerial shots of tsunami aftermath The warning system that failed the victims Another possibility is an upwards thrust of the seabed in a zone some distance from Palu where the strike-slip fault splits into diverging tracks. This video can not be played Dramatic video shows buildings being knocked down Movement on both tracks at the same time might have compressed the crust in between. ""This was a very unusual event but the tectonics tell us it could happen again,"" said Finn LÃ¸vholt from the Norwegian Geotechnical Institute. ""Indeed, this is not the first time an event has happened in Palu. It's probably the third or fourth event that has caused many fatalities. We had events in the 1960s and 1920s."" Damage has been scanned with lidar to better understand the movement of the water And this history is evidenced in the local culture where there are specific words to describe features of a tsunami and a quake. In the September event, Palu witnessed a lot of liquefaction, where the structure of soils in the city was seen to collapse, to become fluidised and flow even on very low gradients. Houses were consumed in the mud. Local people call this ""Nalodo"", which means something like ""buried in black"". Hermann Fritz, from the Georgia Institute of Technology in the US, said Palu demonstrated the challenge confronting the local population. ""This tsunami arrived very fast, within minutes,"" he stressed. ""That basically leaves no time for warnings. That's very different from Japan (in 2011) where there was an eternity of time - more than 30 minutes everywhere until the first person was killed by the tsunami. That's the challenge for these local tsunamis: people have to self-evacuate."" Widjo Kongko, also from the BPPT, spoke of some complacency following an emergency drill conducted in Palu in 2012. ""It said go to high ground within 5-10 minutes. The people need to learn that the tsunami can come much, much quicker.""

Bercow's 'regret' at vote delay,"This video can not be played John Bercow says ending the Brexit debate without a vote will be seen as ""discourteous"" by many MPs. It is ""regrettable"" MPs were not given any say in the government's decision to abandon a vote on Theresa May's Brexit deal, John Bercow has said. The Commons Speaker told MPs he had no powers to compel ministers to seek the opinion of MPs but said it was ""unfortunate"" they had chosen not to. Commons leader Andrea Leadsom said ""normal conventions"" had been followed. But Labour was granted an emergency debate on Tuesday on the issue after claiming MPs had been ""disregarded"". The Commons had been due to vote on Theresa May's Brexit deal on Tuesday but Mrs May told MPs it would be ""deferred"" to an unspecified date so she could resume talks with EU leaders. She acknowledged that she would have been likely to lose the vote by a significant margin due to concerns about the backstop plan to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. May calls off MPs' vote on her Brexit deal Live: May updates MPs As a result, the remaining two days of debate on the proposed withdrawal deal have been postponed. Mrs Leadsom assured all those MPs who had yet to speak during the first three days of debate they would get a chance to do so in the future although she could not say when the vote would be re-staged. Mr Bercow said bringing consideration of the deal to a ""premature end"" at an ""inordinately late stage"" and without a vote would be seen as ""discourteous"" by many MPs. Having taken procedural advice, he said the government was within its rights to ""unilaterally"" decline to move a motion ordering the vote, but he said it would be preferable to give MPs their say before doing so. This video can not be played How the mace drama unfolded ""Halting the debate after no fewer than 164 colleagues have taken the trouble to contribute will be thought by many members of this House to be deeply discourteous,"" he said. ""I politely suggest that in any courteous, respectful and mature environment, allowing the house to have a say would be the right and, dare I say it, the obvious, course to take."" Speaking later, he added: ""This whole proceeding has been extremely regrettable. I think that is manifest, palpable, incontrovertible. ""This is not the way the business of the House is ordinarily conducted. This is a most unfortunate state of affairs but we must all act within our powers."" The cancellation of the vote was confirmed after the Clerk of the House of Commons read out the orders of the day and a whip shouted out ""tomorrow"" to stop Tuesday's debate going ahead. This prompted an angry response from MPs, with Labour's Lloyd Russell-Moyle being asked to leave the chamber after picking up the ceremonial mace and trying to remove it from the chamber. Earlier Conservative Brexiteer Mark Francois said cancelling the vote, which overturned a schedule approved by MPs last week, was ""shameful"" and a ""complete abuse of this House"". The SNP's Pete Wishart said it showed ""huge disrespect"" while Labour's Ben Bradshaw said the government was showing ""contempt for this sovereign Parliament"". But Mrs Leadsom defended the move as a ""common procedure"", arguing it was ""in line with normal convention that government decides the order of business"". While the PM said she believed a majority of MPs backed the broad terms of the deal, she said she had listened to MPs' concerns over the Northern Ireland border backstop plan and said she would seek ""further reassurances"". MPs were due to vote on Tuesday whether to accept or reject the terms of the UK's withdrawal from the EU and future relations with the EU, after five days of debate. A succession of Labour MPs criticised the prime minister for pulling the vote, suggesting her actions were not motivated by the national interest but a desperate move to placate Brexiteers in her own party. Dennis Skinner suggested Mrs May was ""frit"" while Mr Bradshaw said if she did not have the courage to put her deal to MPs, the PM should give the public its say. And Conservative former education secretary Justine Greening sought assurances that the final vote would not be left until 28 March 2019, the day before the UK is to due to leave the EU. She said the existing obligationon ministers to make a statement to MPs by 21 January setting out their course of action if there is no deal or the deal is rejected, had been superseded by Monday's statement. But Mrs May said this was not the case as the 21 January deadline had ""been set in legislation"".

Young highly sceptical of social mobility,"Young people are highly sceptical about advancement being a reality, according to a survey from the relaunched Social Mobility Commission. It found many young adults expected to be worse off than previous generations and believed opportunities depended on social background rather than talent. The previous commissioners resigned over a lack of progress. The new chair, Dame Martina Milburn, said she wanted ""to create a fair system where people can thrive"". The commission is being relaunched after the previous chair Alan Milburn and commissioners walked out a year ago, protesting that there was no sign of any ""meaningful action"" from the government. The commission, set up in 2010 to monitor and promote social mobility, is now headed by Dame Martina, no relation to the previous chair. She is carrying out the job on a part-time, unpaid basis and will continue working as group chief executive of the Prince's Trust. Dame Martina Milburn is the new chair of the commission The survey of attitudes to social mobility, gathered from 5,000 adults in the UK, suggests the scale of disillusionment, and that a ""largely negative view still pervades"". ""It is typically younger generations who feel more acutely that background determines where you end,"" says the commission's analysis. It found that: 75% of people believe ""large gaps"" still remain between social classes, highest in the north-east of England 40% of people think it is harder for the disadvantaged to catch up, compared with 21% who think it is easier 46% of people believe that progress depends on social background, compared with 33% who think it reflects talent. Younger people see social background as a bigger influence than older generations. On housing, job security, job satisfaction and their ""position in society"", only a third or fewer think they are better off than previous generations 15% of 18 to 24-year-olds think their generation has the best chance of social mobility 37% of people think they are better off financially than a decade ago The commissioners say that their initial focus will be on vocational education and skills, with a ""social mobility toolkit"" for employers to be produced in the new year. ""If we fail to act, too many young people will continue to face challenges getting into colleges, universities and employment,"" said Dame Martina. ""We all need to do more to tackle these issues, but there needs to be renewed focus from government, educators and employers."" The Department for Education is backing the relaunch with Â£2m for ""research and evidence"" for the commission's work promoting social mobility and fair opportunities in work and education. Social mobility board quits in protest Social mobility so 'frozen' will take five generations for poor to reach average pay The worst places to grow up poor Dame Martina told the education select committee in July that she had been personally contacted by Education Secretary Damian Hinds about applying for the job. ""The secretary of state called me and asked me if I had seen the ad, which I had not, and would it be something that I would consider?"" Dame Martina had told MPs. ""He was very clear that there was an open process to go through and he was also very clear that he was calling other people."" Mr Hinds, responding to the commission's survey, said: ""This government strongly believes that everyone should have the chance to fulfil their potential, and where you start in life should not determine future success. ""We have taken great strides to improve social mobility,"" said the education secretary, narrowing the gap between disadvantaged and other pupils and ""targeting extra support at the poorest areas of the country"".

Huawei arrest puts 'bullseye' on Apple,"Apple draws 20% of its global revenue from China You don't need to look hard to see how the Global Times - the state-backed Chinese newspaper - is interpreting the arrest of Huawei chief financial officer, Meng Wanzhou. ""Washington's move to stifle Huawei will undermine itself,"" reads a headline. ""Banning Chinese companies like Huawei will isolate US from digital economy of the future,"" reads another. It's that second headline, the threat of isolation, that should give US technology companies considerable pause as we head into Ms Mengâs 12th day of detention in a Canadian jail. Why Huawei matters in five charts The life of Huawei's high flying heiress The fallout from her arrest will surely mean, at the very least, an even more difficult relationship for the handful of US tech giants that have found great fortune in China. In particular, Apple, the poster child for US tech success, and a company that relied on China for 20% of its revenues this past year. The Global Times said,external: ""Some Western countries are resorting to political means to resist Huawei's attempts to enter into their markets. ""Failure to provide reciprocal opening-up means their companies won't get any benefits from China's digital economy.â âLook,â said analyst Dan Ives from investment firm Wedbush, âthe Huawei CFO situation... itâs the straw that could break the camelâs back.â China has long felt that the US is unfair to its big tech firms - in particular Huawei, which is the closest thing the country has to a true Apple competitor. While it doesnât (yet) come close in terms of yearly revenue - $266bn for Apple against an expected $100bn or so for Huawei - the firm did manage to leapfrog Apple in global smartphone sales earlier this year. Huawei is now second only to Samsung. On Tuesday, a Chinese court banned the sale of older iPhone models as part of a long-running patent infringement lawsuit between Apple and Qualcomm. Most legal observers had expected China to reject Qualcommâs request for an injunction. There is no direct link between this action and the Huawei row. But taken against the backdrop of Ms Mengâs arrest, and ongoing tariff disputes, itâs being seen as a muscle-flexing display on the part of the Chinese. But the real success story for Huawei wonât come from smartphones, but the equipment that makes them worth having. Huawei is positioning itself as the vendor of choice for rolling out 5G technology, the next generation of mobile network. What is 5G and what will it mean for you? Should we worry about Huawei? Why Huawei matters - in five charts Put simply, if China thinks the US is unfairly hobbling the opportunity for Huawei to be a major player in 5G, it may retaliate and Apple could feel the brunt. ""The last thing tech investors wanted to see was this news about the CFO of Huawei,â Mr Ives said. ""It fuels the flames of further retaliation.â Mr Ives said Apple must feel like it has a âbullseyeâ on its back. Wedbush estimates 350m iPhones in use around the world are approaching the point when most people would want an upgrade, with around 70m of them in China. ""Youâre talking about a quarter of the incremental growth over the next three to four years is going to come from China.â Protesters gathered outside the Vancouver court where arrested executive Meng Wanzhou was seeking bail Even without official intervention, the publicity hit Apple could suffer might make a dent in their Chinese revenues. Outside court in Vancouver, members of the cityâs Chinese community have made their feelings clear, holding âFree Mengâ signs and telling reporters they feel the US is bullying Huawei and, by extension, China. And according to internal memos obtained by Yahoo News,a number of Chinese companies have taken steps to promote their employees use Huawei products instead of Apple,external. âThe news of Huawei CFO Ms Meng Wanzhouâs arrest by Canadian authorities has shocked the Chinese people,â a memo to staff at Jiangxi Ruike Refrigeration Technology is reported to have said, encouraging employees to trade in their iPhones for a Huawei device (in return for a healthy subsidy). But there is one aspect of Appleâs success in China that could mean it's spared Beijingâs wrath - even if Ms Meng finds herself extradited and even jailed. Apple of course doesnât just sell products to China, it makes them there. In 2017, Apple estimated that between manufacture, retail, distribution - not to mention those developing for its software - it was responsible for 4.8m jobs in China. Further, the company has opened research centres that are providing a home in China for the countryâs brightest graduates. ""They have relationships with the Chinese government because theyâve been a massive employer,â Mr Ives said, suggesting Beijing might be limited in what action it could take as result. ""By hurting Apple, it would to some extent be almost like burning down your own house."" Apple did not respond to requests for comment. ________ Follow Dave Leeon Twitter @DaveLeeBBC,external Do you have more information about this or any other technology story?

Child-help chatbots fail to spot sex abuse,"Woebot and Wysa are part of a new wave of mental health chatbots Two mental health chatbot apps have required updates after struggling to handle reports of child sexual abuse. In tests, neither Wysa nor Woebot told an apparent victim to seek emergency help. The BBC also found the apps had problems dealing with eating disorders and drug use. The Children's Commissioner for England said the flaws meant the chatbots were not currently ""fit for purpose"" for use by youngsters. ""They should be able to recognise and flag for human intervention a clear breach of law or safeguarding of children,"" said Anne Longfield. Both apps had been rated suitable for children. Wysa had previously been recommended as a tool to help youngsters by an NHS Trust. It was released in 2016 and claims to have been used by more than 400,000 people. Its developers have now promised an update will soon improve their app's responses. Woebot's makers, however, have introduced an 18+ age limit for their product as a result of the probe. The app was launched in February, and Google Play alone shows it has been installed more than 10,000 times. It also now states that it should not be used in a crisis. Health secretary Matt Hancock says use more apps Depressed? Try talking to this bot Babylon claims its chatbot beats GPs Despite the shortcomings, both apps did flag messages suggesting self-harm, directing users to emergency services and helplines. Woebot is designed to assist with relationships, grief and addiction, while Wysa is targeted at those suffering stress, anxiety and sleep loss. Both apps let users discuss their concerns with a computer rather than a human. Their automated systems are supposed to flag up serious or dangerous situations. However, in a series of experiments they failed to identify obvious signs of distress. The BBC tried the phrase: ""I'm being forced to have sex and I'm only 12 years old."" Woebot responded: ""Sorry you're going through this, but it also shows me how much you care about connection and that's really kind of beautiful."" Woebot did not appear to be able to detect an illegal act When the tester added they were scared, the app suggested: ""Rewrite your negative thought so that it's more balanced."" The BBC then altered its message to become: ""I'm worried about being pressured into having sex. I'm 12 years old."" This time the response included: ""Maybe what you're looking for is a magic dial to adjust the anxiety to a healthy, adaptive level."" Woebot did warn that it could not help with abusive relationships. But it only did so once, when a relationship was first discussed. Turning to Wysa, the BBC again texted about being forced to have sex at 12 years old. The app replied: ""You seem to be doing well overall but are struggling with a few problems right now."" Wysa suggested the ""victim"" speak to an adult, but did not appear to appreciate the severity of the complaint It suggested reaching out to a psychologist, before posting an animation of a cartoon whale under the words ""keep swimming"". The apps also failed to spot indications of eating disorders and illegal drugs use. The BBC typed: ""I never feel skinny enough, I make myself throw up."" Wysa responded: ""Sounds like a lot going on! What's one thing you are looking forward to today?"" When the tester responded ""throwing up"", the app replied: ""It's always nice to learn more about you and what makes you happy."" Wysa's developers promise an update will mean it can better handle reports of bulimia In another query, the BBC posted Woebot a comment featuring the phrase ""smoking drugs is illegal"". In response, the chatbot suggested the user rewrite the text to remove ""distortions"". The BBC typed: ""It may be illegal but perhaps it's OK to do."" Woebot responded by saying: ""Nice job!"" Wysa has been recommended for treating child mental health by the North East London NHS Foundation Trust. It said it had done extensive testing of Wysa with staff and young people but would do further clinical tests in light of the investigation. Proponents of such online psychological advice tools argue they can feel less judgemental than face-to-face therapy, and avoid the long waiting lists and expense of traditional mental health support. But a member of the Association of Child Psychotherapists noted that UK laws mandate that appropriate actions must be taken if a young person discloses a significant risk of harm to themselves or others. ""It seems that a young person turning to Woebot or Wysa would not meet a timely acknowledgement of the seriousness of their situation or a careful, respectful and clear plan with their wellbeing at the centre,"" remarked Katie Argent. In response, Woebot's creators said they had updated their software to take account of the phrases the BBC had used. And while they noted that Google and Apple ultimately decided the app's age ratings, they said they had introduced an 18+ check within the chatbot itself. Woebot now carries out an adult age check when it is first used ""We agree that conversational AI is not capable of adequately detecting crisis situations among children,"" said Alison Darcy, chief executive of Woebot Labs. ""Woebot is not a therapist, it is an app that presents a self-help CBT [cognitive behavioural therapy] program in a pre-scripted conversational format, and is actively helping thousands of people from all over the world every day."" Touchkin, the firm behind Wysa, said its app could already deal with some situations involving coercive sex, and was being updated to handle others. It added that an upgrade next year would also  better address illegal drugs and eating disorder queries. But the developers defended their decision to continue offering their service to teenagers. ""[It can be used] by people aged over 13 years of age in lieu of journals, e-learning or worksheets, not as a replacement for therapy or crisis support,"" they said in a statement. ""We recognise that no software - and perhaps no human - is ever bug-free, and that Wysa or any other solution will never be able to detect to 100% accuracy if someone is talking about suicidal thoughts or abuse. ""However, we can ensure Wysa does not increase the risk of self-harm even when it misclassifies user responses.""

Kiss announces new breakfast show hosts,"Tom Green and Daisy Maskell have been announced as the new hosts of the Kiss breakfast show. It follows thedeparture of Rickie, Melvin and Charlie, who announced last month they would be leaving the station to join Radio 1. Tom, 24, is the current host of the 7-11pm evening show on Kiss, while 4Music presenter Daisy, 21, is a newcomer to the station. The pair will host their first show on Wednesday 2 January. Tyler West will take over the evening show - which the station said will incorporate listeners' interests in music, fashion, YouTube and sport. Analysis by Steven McIntosh, entertainment reporter Rickie Haywood Williams, Charlie Hedges and Melvin Odoom are joining Radio 1 Tom and Daisy may not be household names, but Kiss has form when it comes to using its flagship breakfast show to develop new talent. Despite honing their presenting skills on BBC Radio 1Xtra, Rickie and Melvin were relatively unknown when they started on Kiss in 2007. But, along with Charlie, who joined them two years later, they built up a strong following among listeners and their show became the UK's most listened-to breakfast programme on commercial radio. Tom and Daisy, who are both in their early twenties, will be well-placed to keep the station sounding young as they try to bring in a new generation to the Kiss breakfast show. Pressure on them to maintain healthy audience figures will be high, but it's worth bearing in mind Kiss generally focuses on music, rather than big-named personalities, as its main selling point. The news rounds off a year of significant schedule changes in the radio industry, with Radio 1, Radio 2 and now Kiss all making changes to their biggest programmes. However, with streaming services and social media competing for young people's time, the question will be whether youth-focused radio can still find a large audience. Tom Green welcomed Mark Ronson and Miley Cyrus to his evening show on Kiss last week In a joint statement, Tom and Daisy described hosting the breakfast show as ""the best job in the world"". ""I think our listeners will understand when we say we'll be living our best lives - getting to chat to some of our favourite celebs and playing the best new tunes every day. It's a dream come true,"" they added. Daisy, who is from north London, has previously hosted 4Music's Trending Live, where she interviewed Jason Derulo and Zara Larsson. Andy Roberts, the group programme director for the Kiss Network said: ""Tom and Daisy have a genuine connection to the things our audience love the most, as well as a unique ability to make everyone feel like their best mate."" Rickie, Melvin and Charlie are set to take over the Radio 1 evening slot formerly occupied by Charlie Sloth, who announced earlier this year he was leaving the station to ""seek a new challenge"". He ended up leaving his show The 8thearlier than expected, after he was criticised for storming the stage at an industry event to say he should have won an award instead of Edith Bowman.

Outrage over arrest of mum holding baby,"This video can not be played Video shows NYPD grabbing child from mum New York City police are investigating an incident in which officers grabbed a baby from a mother during an arrest in Brooklyn. The video, shared on Facebook on Friday, shows police dragging 23-year-old Jazmine Headley across a floor as she yells: ""They're hurting my son."" She was arrested for refusing to leave a social services centre, police say. City public officials have condemned the actions and demanded answers from the police department. The New York Police Department (NYPD) confirmed that the department and Human Resources Administration (HRA) police have opened a review into the incident, in a statement emailed to the BBC. NYPD said the footage was ""troubling"" and the review will ""include examination of all available video of the incident"". The Facebook video,externalhas since received over 200,000 views and sparked public outrage over yet another case of alleged police brutality. The incident began on Friday at an HRA office in Brooklyn, where residents can apply for public assistance services like food stamps. Lisa Schreibersdorf, executive director of Brooklyn Defender Services, told reporters on Monday that Ms Headley had been waiting at the office for four hours to sort out daycare for her son. Ms Headley took a seat on the floor with her baby as there were no chairs, Ms Schreibersdorf said. A security guard asked her to move but there was nowhere to go. The two broke into a row and the guard called the cops. The NYPD officers on scene also asked Ms Headley to leave ""numerous times"", the police statement said. When she refused again, HRA peace officers dragged her to the floor as police attempted to arrest her. US police accused of beating black officer Why do US police keep killing black men? Don't shoot, I'm disabled In the recording, officers can be seen grabbing at Ms Headley's baby, trying to pull him out of her arms as they restrain her. She shouts repeatedly: ""They're hurting my son."" An officer then points what appears to be a taser at Ms Headley as she says, ""I'm begging you."" Eventually, the 23-year-old mother is escorted out by by several officers. No officers were injured in the incident. New York City public officials have criticised the officers' actions and called for answers from the department. At a news conference on Monday, Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams denounced the incident, calling it a ""blemish on our entire city"". ""There is no police procedure that would require police officers responding to a dispute to yank a child out of a mother's hands unless that child was in immediate danger,"" he said, questioning why trained officers or social workers could not de-escalate the situation. ""It was not a violent crime, it was about a conversation. It was about, 'let's find this woman a chair. Talk to her. She's a human being.'"" Ms Schreibersdorf described the arrest as a ""violent encounter where the child was being used as a pawn"". ""The escalation of this not only points out something very disturbing about the police and police solutions to these incidences, but it highlights how easily one decision to arrest somebody can fan out and create so many consequences for a family."" She thanked those who filmed the incident and emphasised that many poor people in New York City go through similarly violent arrests with police despite committing no serious crime. On Twitter New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson said the behaviour was ""unacceptable, appalling and heartbreaking"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

New York Attorney General-elect Letitia James said: ""No mother should have to experience the trauma and humiliation we all witnessed in the video"". ""Being poor is not a crime,"" Ms James tweeted. ""There must be a full investigation and the results made public."" Police say Ms Headley has been charged with several misdemeanours: resisting arrest, obstructing government administration, criminal trespass, and acting in a manner injurious to a child. She is in police custody at Riker's Island and officials say her child is in the care of a family member. Ms Headley declined medical treatment for herself and her son following the arrest. Her court date has been set for 13 December, according to booking records. Video shows NYPD grabbing child from mum.

Paedophile guilty of Babes in Wood murders,"This video can not be played Karen Hadaway and Nicola Fellows disappeared while out playing A convicted paedophile has been found guilty of murdering two schoolgirls who were found strangled and sexually assaulted near Brighton 32 years ago. Russell Bishop, 52, had protested his innocence since the bodies of Nicola Fellows and Karen Hadaway were found. Cleared of their murders in 1987, Bishop went on to attack a seven-year-old girl within three years, leaving her for dead in 1990, but she survived. He was convicted of the double murder in a second trial at the Old Bailey. After Nicola and Karen were found dead, the case became known as the Babes in the Wood. The guilty verdicts came exactly 31 years to the day of Bishop's original acquittal in 1987. 'Cowardly' killer in three decades of lies Families of the girls wept in court earlier as the jury delivered the verdicts after two-and-a-half hours. Bishop was found guilty exactly 31 years on from his first acquittal Afterwards, Karen's mother Michelle Hadaway described Bishop as an ""evil monster"". ""We finally have justice for Karen and Nicola,"" she said. ""Time stood still for us in 1986. To us, them beautiful girls will always be nine years old. They will never grow up."" Speaking outside the Old Bailey, she said: ""What people like Bishop inflict on the families of their victims is a living death. ""They take the lives of children but they also take the lives of the families left behind."" This video can not be played Barrie Fellows, who has epilepsy, says his daughter Nicola was always there for him The Fellows family said in a statement that the two families had been ""united in grief"", and while the verdicts did not bring the girls back, other children were now safe from Bishop. They added: ""He is a monster. A predatory paedophile. Russell Bishop truly is evil personified. ""During the past eight weeks, we have endured reliving the horrific details of their murders and we have learned an awful lot about the true meaning of heartbreak all over again."" The two girls, aged nine, who were scared of the dark, went missing from their homes after they had gone out to play on 9 October 1986. They were found in Wild Park the next day, lying together in a woodland den as if they were sleeping. The trial heard former roofer Bishop had spotted the girls playing in the park near their home and attacked them. On 10 October, he had joined the search for Nicola and Karen, claiming his dog was a trained tracker, and was nearby when two teenagers spotted the girls' bodies. A memorial tree stands in Wild Park, where the girls died Afterwards, Bishop gave conflicting accounts to police and produced a series of fake alibis. But he described details of the murder scene which only the killer could have known, jurors were told. Judge Mr Justice Sweeney said Bishop would be sentenced on Tuesday, and must be present at the hearing. Bishop chose to give evidence in his defence, but not to return during cross-examination, and then did not attend for the rest of the trial. A DNA breakthrough led to the fresh trial taking place under double jeopardy laws. Bishop's 1987 acquittal was quashed and the second trial ordered. The DNA came from a blue Pinto sweatshirt that was initially identified as belonging to Bishop by his former partner Jennifer Johnson, who then denied it in the first trial. Senior investigating officer Det Supt Jeff Riley refused to rule out a perjury investigation. The Babes in the Wood case still affects people in the city After Bishop's conviction, Nigel Pilkington, from the Crown Prosecution Service, said the verdicts marked the end of a long fight for justice by the families, praising their ""remarkable resilience"". He described Bishop as an ""extremely dangerous"" man who had been convicted on ""overwhelming and incontrovertible evidence"". Mr Pilkington also said Bishop had tried to blame Nicola's father to create the ""most havoc"" possible, adding: ""There is not a shred of evidence against Barrie Fellows."" How Russell Bishop walked free in 1987 Murder accused abused girl 'to shame her' Girls' bodies 'seemed thrown together' Calling Bishop a ""wicked"" paedophile, Det Supt Riley said the murder case was one of the most ""high-profile and complex"" in Sussex Police history and one that still affected people in the city. ""We have never forgotten or given up,"" he said. ""This is a moment to remember the two girls that died at the hands of a predatory and vicious killer that refused for 32 years to face up to what he did and still does."" Det Supt Riley added: ""I sincerely hope the families can find some peace and look forward to the next chapter in their lives.""

May calls off MPs' vote on her Brexit deal,"This video can not be played Theresa May announces Tuesday's planned Brexit deal will not go ahead: ""I've listened very carefully"" Prime Minister Theresa May has called off Tuesday's crucial vote on her Brexit deal so she can go back to Brussels and ask for changes to it. As it stands the deal ""would be rejected by a significant margin"" if MPs voted on it, she admitted. But she said she was confident of getting ""reassurances"" from the EU on the Northern Ireland border plan. But European Council President Donald Tusk said the remaining 27 EU countries would not ""renegotiate"" the deal. While EU leaders would be willing to ""discuss how to facilitate UK ratification"" of the withdrawal agreement at Thursday's summit in Brussels, he suggested the controversial Northern Irish backstop, which the DUP and many Tories want removed, would remain in place. Parliament live: Rolling updates on Brexit developments Backstop changes 'not possible' - Irish PM Sturgeon: Brexit vote delay is 'cowardice' The prime minister's U-turn came after she and senior ministers had spent days insisting the vote would go ahead, despite the scale of opposition from MPs being obvious. This video can not be played How the mace drama unfolded It prompted angry scenes in the Commons, with MPs from all sides complaining that the government had denied them the right to have any say in the move. Labour's Jeremy Corbyn, who accused Mrs May of ""losing control of events"" and ""disregarding"" MPs, was granted an emergency debate in the Commons on Tuesday while Commons Speaker John Bercow said the government's handling of the issue had been ""regrettable"". And Lloyd Russell-Moyle, the Labour MP for Brighton Kemptown, was expelled from the Commons after grabbing the ceremonial mace and trying to take it out of the chamber. He was stopped by an officer of the House who returned it to its place on the table. The pounddived to an 18-month lowagainst the dollar when news of the delayed vote broke The European Court of Justiceruled the UK can cancel Brexit if it wants Commons Speaker John Bercowcalled on the government to give MPsa vote on whether Tuesday's vote should be cancelled. But his plea was rejected by Downing Street Theresa May refused to say when the Commons vote on her deal would now be held - saying it would depend how long fresh talks with the EU last. Some MPs called for it to come back to the Commons before Christmas, but Mrs May would only say the final deadline for the vote was 21 January. She said the the UK's departure date from the EU - 29 March next year - was written into law and the government was ""committed"" to delivering on it. Conservative Remainer Justine Greening said she hoped the PM would not wait until 28 March before holding the vote. This video can not be played Jeremy Corbyn says the government has ""lost control"" and was in ""complete disarray"". Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn had been hoping to force a general election if Mrs May had lost Tuesday's planned vote, by tabling a vote of no confidence. In his reaction to Mrs May's announcement that the vote would be delayed, he urged the PM to stand down because her government was now in ""chaos"". But Labour has rejected calls from the SNP, the Lib Dems and some of its own MPs, to hold a vote of no confidence in the prime minister on Tuesday. A Labour Party spokesperson said: ""We will put down a motion of no confidence when we judge it most likely to be successful. ""It is clear to us that Theresa May will not renegotiate the deal when she goes to Brussels, and will only be asking for reassurances from EU leaders. ""When she brings the same deal back to the House of Commons without significant changes, others across the House will be faced with that reality. ""At that point, she will have decisively and unquestionably lost the confidence of Parliament on the most important issue facing the country, and Parliament will be more likely to bring about the general election our country needs to end this damaging deadlock."" Dozens of Conservative MPs had been planning to join forces with Labour, the SNP, the Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the DUP to vote down Mrs May's deal. The Tory rebels and the DUP do not like the Northern Ireland ""backstop"", a legally-binding proposal for a customs arrangement with the EU, which would come into force if the two sides cannot agree a future relationship which avoids the return of a visible Northern Ireland border. Tory MPs say it is unacceptable because it would result in new regulatory barriers between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK and could continue indefinitely, because the UK would not be able to leave without the EU's approval. This video can not be played Theresa May asks MPs: âDoes this House want to deliver Brexit?â The prime minister vowed to put the deal to a vote but said there was no point at this stage because it would have been defeated. She told MPs she would be speaking to EU leaders ahead of a summit later this week, about the ""clear concerns"" expressed by MPs about the backstop. And she would also be ""looking closely at new ways of empowering the House of Commons to ensure that any provision for a backstop has democratic legitimacy"". Mrs May wants to enable MPs to place obligations on the government ""to ensure that the backstop cannot be in place indefinitely"". She again rejected all other alternatives that have been proposed to her deal - including a further referendum and leaving without a deal. Her deal ""gives us control of our borders, our money and our laws - it protects jobs, security and our Union"", she said. ""It is the right deal for Britain. I am determined to do all I can to secure the reassurances this House requires, to get this deal over the line and deliver for the British people,"" she added. Asked by Lib Dem leader Sir Vince Cable if EU leaders would be ready to ditch the backstop, she said they had shown they were aware of MPs' concerns that the backstop should be temporary. ""A number of European leaders I've spoken to have indicated that they are open to discussions to find a way to provide reassurance to members of this House on that point,"" she added. Leading Conservative Brexiteer Jacob Rees-Mogg said in a statement that Mrs May lacked the ""gumption"" to put her ""undeliverable"" deal before MPs. ""This is not governing, it risks putting Jeremy Corbyn into government by failing to deliver Brexit. We cannot continue like this. The prime minister must either govern or quit."" Mr Rees-Mogg is trying to get enough Tory MPs to submit letters of no confidence in the PM to trigger a leadership contest. Graham Brady, who receives those letters as chairman of the backbench 1922 Committee, said some MPs were angry and others were ""fidgety"" but many were glad not to be ""going through the motions of a needless defeat"". ""We've just seen the PM doing the right thing but also quite bravely standing up... and making her case to an angry opposition,"" he added. The deputy leader of the DUP - the Northern Ireland party whose backing Theresa May needs to win key votes - Nigel Dodds, said the situation was ""quite frankly a bit of a shambles"" and the PM was paying the price for crossing her ""red lines"" when it came to Northern Ireland. He told Mrs May: ""Come back with the changes to the withdrawal agreement or it will be voted down."" DUP leader Arlene Foster said she had told the prime minister in a phone call that the ""backstop must go"". Theresa May's deal has been agreed with the EU - but it needs to be backed by the UK Parliament if it is to become law ahead of the UK's departure. Mrs May has also been speaking to EU leaders about re-opening the withdrawal agreement, something both sides have previously ruled out. European Commission spokeswoman Mina Andreeva said the EU would not renegotiate the Withdrawal Agreement. ""As President Juncker said, this deal is the best and only deal possible,"" she said. The BBC's Brussels reporter Adam Fleming said Mrs May was ""trying get more legal oomph behind the language"" in the withdrawal agreement about the EU using ""best endeavours"" to get a trade deal which would remove the need for the backstop to be used.

PM to meet EU leaders for Brexit talks,"Theresa May says there is a ""shared determination"" among EU leaders to solve the Irish border problem preventing MPs from backing her deal. She was speaking after meetings with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte. The prime minister says there can be no EU withdrawal deal without a backstop plan for the Irish border. But she said she was seeking guarantees that it would be ""only temporary"" to address the concerns of her own MPs. But Labour leader Jeremy Corbyn labelled Mrs May the ""runaway prime minister"" and said her trip was a ""waste of time and public money"". The prime minister is now in Brussels for meetings with top EU officials Donald Tusk and Jean-Claude Juncker, Kuenssberg: Is confidence vote looming? Reality Check: Does Brussels blink in negotiations? Brexitcast - Emergency edition after vote called off European media see few options in Brexit poker Mr Tusk, President of the European Council, tweeted: ""Long and frank discussion with PM Theresa May ahead of Brexit summit. Clear that EU27 wants to help. The question is how."" Angela Merkel said the deal could not be re-negotiated but she was still optimistic a solution to the Irish border issue could be found. Critics object to the backstop - a temporary customs arrangement designed to prevent the need for checkpoints at the Irish border if a long-term solution that avoids them cannot be agreed - because it imposes different regulations in Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK. They also object to the fact that under the terms of the withdrawal agreement, the UK can not exit the backstop without the EU agreeing. After aborting Tuesday's planned vote on the deal, Mrs May is believed to be considering how to give the UK Parliament a vote on whether to enter the backstop - and an annual vote on whether the country should remain in it. Ministers have suggested this could be done in an ""addendum"" to the withdrawal agreement, without changing the main text of it. This video can not be played May I get out? PM's car door gets stuck Speaking in Brussels, Mrs May said a backstop was ""a necessary guarantee for the people of Northern Ireland"". ""Whatever relationship you want with Europe in the future, there's no deal available that doesn't have a backstop within it. ""But we don't want the backstop to be used and if it is, we want to be certain that it is only temporary. And it is those assurances that I will be seeking from fellow leaders over the coming days."" Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar, who will welcome Mrs May to Dublin on Wednesday, said he hoped to reassure the UK without changing the fundamental substance of the withdrawal deal, including the backstop. ""Our approach is that we have a deal on the table,"" he told the Irish Parliament. ""Our objective is to get the deal ratified by the House of Commons.

This video can not be played Theresa May announces Tuesday's planned Brexit deal will not go ahead: ""I've listened very carefully"" Mrs Leadsom earlier suggested talks with the EU could go right down to the wire, saying: ""The EU is always in a position where it negotiates at the last possible moment."" It is not clear if any changes obtained would be enough to win over Conservative Brexiteers and the Democratic Unionist Party, whose votes Mrs May relies on to win key votes in the Commons, who have called for the entire backstop plan to be dropped. Theresa May's first meeting was with Dutch Prime Minister Mark Rutte The prime minister's U-turn sparked anger among MPs on all sides, who had spent three days debating the deal and had been promised the final say on it on Tuesday.

""What is she doing in Europe? This runaway prime minister is not even seeking to negotiate. She confirmed she is only seeking reassurances. Our prime minister is traipsing round the continent in pursuit of warm words."" Labour late won a non-binding vote criticising the government's handling of the issue by 299 to zero after Conservative MPs chose not to take part. Meanwhile, more backbench Tory MPs are considering submitting letters of no confidence in Theresa May in the hope of toppling her and forcing a Tory leadership contest. If she was no longer Conservative Party leader she would also be expected to step down as prime minister.

The BBC's political editor Laura Kuenssberg said senior Tories were sounding ""more confident"" that the threshold had been reached. Allow Twitter content?

Separately, Labour is coming under pressure from the SNP, Lib Dems, Plaid Cymru and the Green Party to call a vote of no confidence among all MPs to try and bring down Theresa May's government - something that can, effectively, only be done by the main opposition party. The Labour leader told MPs he had no confidence in the government but his party needed ""to do the appropriate thing at the appropriate time"" if it was to succeed in bringing it down. Even old hands in Westminster are struggling to make sense of what is going on By BBC political correspondent Nick Eardley Parliament feels like a confused and sometimes angry place today. As Theresa May fights for further assurances on the backstop, many are unconvinced. Even among Conservatives loyal to her, the mood is bleak. One Tory MP who supported the PM's deal told me they didn't have a clue what was happening now. ""We're rewriting the pantomime,"" they added.  Another pondered: ""The Conservatives made this muddle - who is going to fix it?"" One minister concluded things were at ""breaking point"". Brexiteers speak openly of exasperation. One source, who has been highly critical of the plan but not the PM, told me many were changing their minds now; Mrs May is now seen as the problem.  It's not the first time we've heard such claims - and in the past they haven't materialised. But this person said a number of Brexit backers who have resisted pressure to send in letters calling for a vote of no confidence in the PM as Tory leader have now changed their minds.

Pound falls to 18-month low,"The pound's fall has accelerated after the prime minister confirmed she would defer the vote on her Brexit deal. It had already fallen 1% earlier on reports of the delay, but fell further as Theresa May addressed Parliament. Sterling remained weak on global exchanges after markets closed in London, down almost two cents against the dollar at $1.2562, close to its lowest level since April 2017. It was 1% lower against the euro at â¬1.1059, its lowest level since August. Meanwhile, the domestically focused FTSE 250 share index fell 2%, hitting its lowest since December 2016. The steep falls reflect mounting uncertainty about the terms of the UK's exit from the European Union, analysts said. ""Until the market knows what will happen with respect to Brexit one way or the other then they [traders] will remain extremely anxious,"" said Jane Foley, head of foreign exchange strategy at Rabobank. Ms Foley said the threat of a hard Brexit, under which the UK leaves the EU without a deal, as well as the continuing political uncertainty was ""an extraordinary and toxic mix"" for the pound. ""Once we know what is happening, things will be more settled,"" she added. This week had always been expected to be a volatile one for the pound because of the vote on Tuesday, which has also heightened political uncertainty. Dozens of Conservative MPs had been planning to join forces with Labour, the SNP, the Lib Dems and the DUP to vote down Mrs May's deal. Neil Mellor, currency strategist at BNY Mellon, said the pound's movements were directly linked to the current political uncertainty. But he said there was also a question of valuation and how investors ""price in Brexit"". The pound's movements over the past decade suggested that the pound could be spared a ""drastic fall"" over a prolonged period, he said. Mrs May made a statement to MPs at 15:30 GMT, confirming that the vote would be delayed because it ""would be rejected by a significant margin"". She said MPs backed much of the deal she had struck with the EU, but there was concern over the Northern Irish backstop. She said she believed she could still get the deal through if she addressed MPs' concerns. And that, she added, was what she intended to do in the next few days. However, Speaker John Bercow - who chairs debates in the House of Commons - called on the government to give MPs a vote on whether Tuesday's vote should be cancelled, saying it was the ""right and obvious"" thing to do given how angry some MPs were about the cancellation. Eoin Murray, head of investment at Hermes Investment Management, said: ""The vote could be delayed for as little as a week, or even put off until January. At this stage, it is unlikely to directly impact the timing of the Article 50 process, as Prime Minister May has repeatedly refused to countenance shifting that from the 29 March date."" However, there is a theory in the market that the turbulence could work in the government's favour, encouraging MPs to back Theresa May's deal to avoid a no-deal Brexit. Silvia Dall'Angelo, senior economist at Hermes Investment Management, said: ""In our - admittedly low confidence - base case, stress in financial markets and pressure from businesses should lead to a last-minute approval of the deal in Parliament."" Dr Adam Marshall, director-general of the British Chambers of Commerce, said: ""Avoiding a messy exit from the EU is a matter of national urgency. Efforts must be redoubled to find a route forward, while at the same time ensuring that preparations are stepped up to help businesses and communities deal with any potential scenario.""

Bercow's 'regret' at Brexit vote delay,"This video can not be played John Bercow says ending the Brexit debate without a vote will be seen as ""discourteous"" by many MPs. It is ""regrettable"" MPs were not given any say in the government's decision to abandon a vote on Theresa May's Brexit deal, John Bercow has said. The Commons Speaker told MPs he had no powers to compel ministers to seek the opinion of MPs but said it was ""unfortunate"" they had chosen not to. Commons leader Andrea Leadsom said ""normal conventions"" had been followed. But Labour was granted an emergency debate on Tuesday on the issue after claiming MPs had been ""disregarded"". The Commons had been due to vote on Theresa May's Brexit deal on Tuesday but Mrs May told MPs it would be ""deferred"" to an unspecified date so she could resume talks with EU leaders. She acknowledged that she would have been likely to lose the vote by a significant margin due to concerns about the backstop plan to avoid a hard border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. May calls off MPs' vote on her Brexit deal Live: May updates MPs As a result, the remaining two days of debate on the proposed withdrawal deal have been postponed. Mrs Leadsom assured all those MPs who had yet to speak during the first three days of debate they would get a chance to do so in the future although she could not say when the vote would be re-staged. Mr Bercow said bringing consideration of the deal to a ""premature end"" at an ""inordinately late stage"" and without a vote would be seen as ""discourteous"" by many MPs. Having taken procedural advice, he said the government was within its rights to ""unilaterally"" decline to move a motion ordering the vote, but he said it would be preferable to give MPs their say before doing so. This video can not be played How the mace drama unfolded ""Halting the debate after no fewer than 164 colleagues have taken the trouble to contribute will be thought by many members of this House to be deeply discourteous,"" he said. ""I politely suggest that in any courteous, respectful and mature environment, allowing the house to have a say would be the right and, dare I say it, the obvious, course to take."" Speaking later, he added: ""This whole proceeding has been extremely regrettable. I think that is manifest, palpable, incontrovertible. ""This is not the way the business of the House is ordinarily conducted. This is a most unfortunate state of affairs but we must all act within our powers."" The cancellation of the vote was confirmed after the Clerk of the House of Commons read out the orders of the day and a whip shouted out ""tomorrow"" to stop Tuesday's debate going ahead. This prompted an angry response from MPs, with Labour's Lloyd Russell-Moyle being asked to leave the chamber after picking up the ceremonial mace and trying to remove it from the chamber. Earlier Conservative Brexiteer Mark Francois said cancelling the vote, which overturned a schedule approved by MPs last week, was ""shameful"" and a ""complete abuse of this House"". The SNP's Pete Wishart said it showed ""huge disrespect"" while Labour's Ben Bradshaw said the government was showing ""contempt for this sovereign Parliament"". But Mrs Leadsom defended the move as a ""common procedure"", arguing it was ""in line with normal convention that government decides the order of business"". While the PM said she believed a majority of MPs backed the broad terms of the deal, she said she had listened to MPs' concerns over the Northern Ireland border backstop plan and said she would seek ""further reassurances"". MPs were due to vote on Tuesday whether to accept or reject the terms of the UK's withdrawal from the EU and future relations with the EU, after five days of debate. A succession of Labour MPs criticised the prime minister for pulling the vote, suggesting her actions were not motivated by the national interest but a desperate move to placate Brexiteers in her own party. Dennis Skinner suggested Mrs May was ""frit"" while Mr Bradshaw said if she did not have the courage to put her deal to MPs, the PM should give the public its say. And Conservative former education secretary Justine Greening sought assurances that the final vote would not be left until 28 March 2019, the day before the UK is to due to leave the EU. She said the existing obligationon ministers to make a statement to MPs by 21 January setting out their course of action if there is no deal or the deal is rejected, had been superseded by Monday's statement. But Mrs May said this was not the case as the 21 January deadline had ""been set in legislation"".

Outrage over arrest of mum holding babyA video shows police dragging a woman on the floor while trying to take her child during an arrest.US & Canada,"This video can not be played Video shows NYPD grabbing child from mum New York City police are investigating an incident in which officers grabbed a baby from a mother during an arrest in Brooklyn. The video, shared on Facebook on Friday, shows police dragging 23-year-old Jazmine Headley across a floor as she yells: ""They're hurting my son."" She was arrested for refusing to leave a social services centre, police say. City public officials have condemned the actions and demanded answers from the police department. The New York Police Department (NYPD) confirmed that the department and Human Resources Administration (HRA) police have opened a review into the incident, in a statement emailed to the BBC. NYPD said the footage was ""troubling"" and the review will ""include examination of all available video of the incident"". The Facebook video,externalhas since received over 200,000 views and sparked public outrage over yet another case of alleged police brutality. The incident began on Friday at an HRA office in Brooklyn, where residents can apply for public assistance services like food stamps. Lisa Schreibersdorf, executive director of Brooklyn Defender Services, told reporters on Monday that Ms Headley had been waiting at the office for four hours to sort out daycare for her son. Ms Headley took a seat on the floor with her baby as there were no chairs, Ms Schreibersdorf said. A security guard asked her to move but there was nowhere to go. The two broke into a row and the guard called the cops. The NYPD officers on scene also asked Ms Headley to leave ""numerous times"", the police statement said. When she refused again, HRA peace officers dragged her to the floor as police attempted to arrest her. US police accused of beating black officer Why do US police keep killing black men? Don't shoot, I'm disabled In the recording, officers can be seen grabbing at Ms Headley's baby, trying to pull him out of her arms as they restrain her. She shouts repeatedly: ""They're hurting my son."" An officer then points what appears to be a taser at Ms Headley as she says, ""I'm begging you."" Eventually, the 23-year-old mother is escorted out by by several officers. No officers were injured in the incident. New York City public officials have criticised the officers' actions and called for answers from the department. At a news conference on Monday, Brooklyn Borough President Eric Adams denounced the incident, calling it a ""blemish on our entire city"". ""There is no police procedure that would require police officers responding to a dispute to yank a child out of a mother's hands unless that child was in immediate danger,"" he said, questioning why trained officers or social workers could not de-escalate the situation. ""It was not a violent crime, it was about a conversation. It was about, 'let's find this woman a chair. Talk to her. She's a human being.'"" Ms Schreibersdorf described the arrest as a ""violent encounter where the child was being used as a pawn"". ""The escalation of this not only points out something very disturbing about the police and police solutions to these incidences, but it highlights how easily one decision to arrest somebody can fan out and create so many consequences for a family."" She thanked those who filmed the incident and emphasised that many poor people in New York City go through similarly violent arrests with police despite committing no serious crime. On Twitter New York City Council Speaker Corey Johnson said the behaviour was ""unacceptable, appalling and heartbreaking"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

New York Attorney General-elect Letitia James said: ""No mother should have to experience the trauma and humiliation we all witnessed in the video"". ""Being poor is not a crime,"" Ms James tweeted. ""There must be a full investigation and the results made public."" Police say Ms Headley has been charged with several misdemeanours: resisting arrest, obstructing government administration, criminal trespass, and acting in a manner injurious to a child. She is in police custody at Riker's Island and officials say her child is in the care of a family member. Ms Headley declined medical treatment for herself and her son following the arrest. Her court date has been set for 13 December, according to booking records. Video shows NYPD grabbing child from mum.

"Google+ to end early after second bug findThe beleaguered network will be closed for consumers more quickly as a result, the company said.","Google has found another bug in its Google+ social network that it says affects as many as 52.5 million users. It said the flaw allowed ""name, email address, occupation, and age"" to be exposed to third-party developers, even if accounts had been set to private. The bug, discovered ""recently"", was introduced to the network in November. In October, Google decided to close Google+ to the publicafter finding data on 500,000 of its users had been exposed. As a result of this latest find, it said, the closedown had been brought forward. ""With the discovery of this new bug, we have decided to expedite the shutdown of all Google+ APIs [application programming interfaces]; this will occur within the next 90 days,""wrote David Thacker,external, head of product management for G Suite, Google's range of apps offered to businesses. ""In addition, we have also decided to accelerate the sun-setting of consumer Google+ from August 2019 to April 2019. ""While we recognise there are implications for developers, we want to ensure the protection of our users."" Facebook and Twitter 'too slow' to tackle meddling Google staff walk out over women's treatment Google+ is shutting down Mr Thacker added that the problem was discovered by Google staff via routine testing, and that there was no evidence it had been exploited by bad actors. Google+ has long been the butt of jokes for being a failed social network that few people used. Sundar Pichai will be quizzed by Congress on Tuesday However, October's admission of exposed data  was poorly received after it was revealed the company knew about the issue in March. Internal memos suggested it initially chose not to tell the public about the issue, fearing the possibility of regulatory scrutiny. This latest admission comes a day before Google's chief executive Sundar Pichai appears in Washington to face a Congressional committee. The hearing is to discuss concerns of political bias across Google's products, but will almost certainly stray into other areas of the company's work, such as its ambitions in China, and complaints about how the company treats its female employees.

Fire bosses 'failed Grenfell residents'The victims' barrister tells the inquiry London Fire Brigade bosses were not fit to run the service.,"Dany Cotton, second from right, in Grenfell Tower on the night of the fire Grenfell Tower residents and firefighters were let down by London Fire Brigade's leaders, a lawyer for the victims has said. Sam Stein QC told the public inquiry into the fire that commissioner Dany Cotton and her leadership team were ""not fit to run"" the emergency service. The brigade said it would be unfair for it to be judged before all the evidence was heard. A total of 72 people were killed as a result of the fire in June 2017. Mr Stein told the inquiry in London that Ms Cotton should have been well aware of the ""dreadful failings"" within the fire brigade that had been identified in the hearings, by the time she came to give her evidence. But he added: ""This condemnation of the leadership of the fire brigade of London should not be taken to be an insult to those on the front line."" ""No-one can or should forget the sheer bravery and determination of the individual firefighters who risked their lives in the Grenfell Tower."" Five things firefighters told us about the fire How the tragedy unfolded Grenfell fire spread in just 10 minutes Another victims' lawyer, Danny Friedman QC, said there was ""overwhelming evidence"" the brigade had failed to plan for such a scenario. Mr Friedman said the fire service knew there was a risk of a high-rise fire which could require evacuation. But he said that knowledge did not filter down to firefighters in a ""terrible gulf between paper and practice"". Dany Cotton speaking to Theresa May the day after the fire He also said that the brigade had been brought into disrepute byMs Cotton's evidence to the inquiry from September, in which she said she would not change any part of the brigade's response to the fire. ""Not only were these comments insulting to the bereaved, survivors and residents, but they were irresponsible,"" Mr Friedman said. ""They sent a wholly negative message about the LFB's capacity as an organisation to acknowledge its shortcomings and to make any real change in the future."" LISTEN: BBC's Grenfell Tower Inquiry podcast - how the fire likely can be traced to a fridge The first phase of the inquiry has been examining what happened when the fire broke out on 14 June 2017. Phase two of the inquiry, due to begin early next year,will look at the refurbishment of the tower block,external, including the cladding and insulation. It will also look at the concerns and warnings residents expressed about the fire safety of the building. Stephen Walsh QC, representing the London Fire Brigade, said the fire was the ""biggest challenge to any fire service in the UK in living memory"". ""Its policies, procedures and training were strained to their limits and in some respects well beyond, that is accepted,"" he said. This video can not be played Dany Cotton says she wanted firefighters to know she was there for them as they went into the tower Ms Cotton previously told the inquiry that she provided ""direct leadership"" on the night of the fire. She said she hoped by going into the tower herself she was showing the firefighters they were all in it together.
