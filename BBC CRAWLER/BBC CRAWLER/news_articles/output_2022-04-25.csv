PM promises new Wylfa nuclear power station,"Previous plans for a new nuclear power plant at Wylfa collapsed due to a lack of UK government funding The prime minister has vowed that a new nuclear power station will be built at Wylfa on Anglesey. Boris Johnson made the promise on a council election campaign visit in north Wales on Monday. The UK government has been talks with two US firms interested in a scheme at the site - no agreement has yet been reached. Mr Johnson said he wanted it to ""get it going as fast as possible"". But Labour's Shadow Welsh Secretary said it was a ""U-turn"" by the Conservatives and doubted whether the proposals would come to fruition. A previous plan for a new nuclear power station at Wylfacollapsed in 2020. Minister visits US for Wylfa nuclear deal Wylfa nuclear station 'would transform economy' Mr Johnson said: ""We need to get the right type and we need to make sure that we go ahead with the right model. ""We want to make sure we get the right deal for the UK taxpayer. ""But we also want to have something that's really ambitious, and that is going to do justice to the scale of that Wylfa site."" He said there could be a ""couple of reactors"" put at the site. ""We're now working on all this very, very fast. We want to get going on Wylfa in the next couple of years. ""It's going to happen"", he added. Boris Johnson visited Rhyl on Monday There would still be a considerable way to go before any deal is struck to build a new nuclear power station. Any company interested would need to raise a substantial amount of private sector investment as well as receive significant support from the state. On the visit Mr Johnson said he was not concerned that party-gate or a row over claims about Angela Rayner would affect the Tories council election campaign. ""This is an election about what candidates which candidates are going to deliver you value for money,"" he said. ""It's conservative councillors who deliver better value for money, better taxpayer value."" Labour Shadow Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens said Boris Johnson's comments that a power station will happen at Wylfa was ""another U-turn in a series of U-turns"". Ms Stevens said: ""I really hope that he does fulfil his promise and it is true. ""But with this prime minister, you just don't know."" ""We need an energy mix to deal with the current energy crisis,"" she said. ""So this is good news. But we could have done with it before now."" A Welsh Liberal Democrat spokesperson said: ""The Welsh Liberal Democrats have said while we recognise the investment and jobs new nuclear can bring the region it is important to note that this will do nothing in the short term to address the energy crisis and the impact it is having on people's bank accounts across Wales. ""We also believe that any development of the Wylfa site must be done with community consent and those that live near the plant should receive discounts on their electricity bills."" Anthony Slaughter, leader of the Wales Green Party, said: ""A new nuclear power station at Wylfa is nothing but an expensive distraction and in no way an answer to the energy crisis and the climate emergency. ""We need to be reachingÂ net zero as a matter of urgency, even by the most optimistic timetable newÂ nuclear would would take a decade to be up and running.""

US wants weakened Russia to avoid repeat of Ukraine,"Mr Austin (L) and Mr Blinken (R) became the highest level US officials to travel to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin has said he hopes Russian losses in Ukraine will deter its leadership from repeating its actions elsewhere. Ukraine can still win the war if given the right support, he added. He also announced the US would allocate an extra $713m (Â£559m) of military aid to Ukraine and other European nations. Russian President Vladimir Putin has accused the West of attempting to ""split Russian society and destroy Russia from within"". Mr Austin, a retired four-star general, was speaking after meeting Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv. Also involving Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the visit marked the highest-level trip to Ukraine by US officials since the invasion began over two months ago. The meeting between the US and Ukrainian parties, which ran for over three hours, comes as Russia escalates its military campaign in the south and east of the country. At a news conference in Poland after the visit, Mr Austin told reporters the US wants to see ""Russia weakened to the degree that it can't do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine"". The Pentagon chief added that US officials still believed Ukraine could win the conflict with ""the right equipment"" and the ""right support"". BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale observed that Mr Austin's comments calling for a weakened Russia were unusually strong for a US defence secretary. It is one thing to help Ukraine resist Russian aggression, it is quite another to speak of weakening Russia's capabilities, he said. Mr Putin's accusations of the West attempting to ""destroy Russia"", made during a speech on Monday, appeared to be in response to Mr Austin's comments. Mr Zelensky has called for increased military assistance from Western nations US defence officials said of the millions announced in fresh military funding, nearly $332m (Â£260m) would be allocated to Ukraine. It brings the total US security assistance provided to Ukraine since the invasion began to more than $3.7bn (Â£2.9bn). Mr Zelensky has been pleading with Western leaders to increase the flow of military equipment for weeks, vowing that his forces can overcome Russia's military if provided with fighter jets and other vehicles. Last week the US confirmed it had supplied Ukrainian troops with howitzer artillery cannons and anti-artillery radars for the first time. Russia's ambassador in Washington said Moscow had sent a diplomatic note demanding an end to the US supply of weapons to Ukraine. Mr Blinken announced some US diplomatic staff would start to return to Ukraine from next week. They are expected to be based in Lviv initially, with a longer-term plan to re-open the US Embassy in the capital, Kyiv. Russia is believed to have suffered heavy military losses President Joe Biden intends to nominate Bridget Brink, a career diplomat, as US ambassador to Ukraine - a post that has remained vacant for more than two years. Mr Blinken also defended America's diplomatic approach, telling reporters that the Western alliance the Biden administration had assembled had put pressure on President Putin's government. ""The strategy that we've put in place, massive support for Ukraine, massive pressure against Russia, solidarity with more than 30 countries engaged in these efforts, is having real results,"" Mr Blinken said. ""And we're seeing that when it comes to Russia's war aims, Russia is failing, Ukraine is succeeding."" ""A sovereign, independent Ukraine will be around a lot longer than Vladimir Putin's on the scene,"" Mr Blinken added. Speaking following the meeting, Mr Zelensky said his government appreciated ""the unprecedented assistance"" from Washington and added that he ""would like to thank President Biden personally and on behalf of the entire Ukrainian people for his leadership in supporting Ukraine"". President Biden's always made clear that the US won't directly intervene in the war in Ukraine. He won't be sending American troops to join the battle. But the truth is that the US is getting more deeply involved - and that's been highlighted by the words of the US defence secretary. America has dramatically increased the supply of weapons to Ukraine in recent weeks. Despite Russian warnings, it's made clear it'll be sending more. Mr Austin's words underline that America is not a bystander in this war. America wants to see Russia defeated. More than that, it wants to see Russia's military machine reduced to such an extent that it will not be able to threaten any another European ally in the future. The fear, shared by Nato allies, is that any kind of defeat for Ukraine will only embolden President Putin's ambitions. Mr Austin has now set out clearly that the US has its own strategic goals for this war - even if it's theoretically not participating. The goal is to stop President Putin and to weaken Russia's military to such an extent that it will no longer be able to threaten other nations. To some extent that's already happened. Military experts already believe it will take years for Russia to recover from its military losses. That might also send a signal to another nation which the US is increasingly concerned about - namely China. For President Putin it's more evidence that he's not just in a war with Ukraine. No doubt it will feed his own narrative for the purposes of domestic support. He's long portrayed Nato as a threat to Russia. In recent days Russia has refocussed its advance on Ukraine's eastern Donbas region and US sources believe that Moscow has committed over 76 battalion tactical groups inside Ukraine. On Monday, the UK's ministry of defence said in an update that Moscow had made minor advances in the region but had ""yet to achieve a breakthrough"" because of logistical issues. The update said: ""Ukraine's defence of Mariupol has also exhausted many Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness."" Have you been affected by what is happening in Ukraine?

Pubs can stay open later for Platinum Jubilee,"Venues can stay open until 01:00 over the extended four-day bank holiday weekend in June to mark the Queen's 70-year reign Pubs, bars and nightclubs in England and Wales can stay open later to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. Opening hours will be extended by two hours to 01:00 BST over the extended bank holiday weekend between 2 and 4 June, under new government plans. Home Secretary Priti Patel said it will allow people to ""raise a glass to toast Her Majesty's incredible service"". The temporary extension to licensing regulations will not apply to supermarkets or off-licences. The Queen became the first British monarch to celebrate a Platinum Jubilee, when in February she marked 70 years since ascending to the throne, An extended four-day bank holiday weekend between 2 and 5 June to celebrate her reign will feature a variety of celebrations, including street parties and astar-studded concert outside Buckingham Palace. Parliament is set to approve an order on Monday to allow people to continue their celebrations of the historic milestone, the government said. Queen celebrates 96th birthday in Sandringham The mystery of the house where the Queen was born What makes the Queen laugh? The Queen's life in pictures Announcing the licensing plans, Priti Patel said the Queen has served the UK with the ""utmost dignity, steadfastness and resolve"" for over 70 years. Licensing laws can be relaxed by the home secretary for occasions of ""exceptional national significance"",  the Home Office explained. Ms Patel said: ""The Platinum Jubilee is a truly historic national occasion, which will see families, friends and communities across the country come together to celebrate this unprecedented landmark in a remarkable reign. ""Over the extended bank holiday weekend, we will be able to raise a glass to toast Her Majesty's incredible service to our country, while also providing a boost to the hospitality industry after a challenging couple of years."" The order will not extend to businesses which sell alcohol for consumption off the premises, such as off-licences and supermarkets, the government has decided following public consultation of the plans. The move was supported by the National Police Chiefs' Council and National Association of Licensing and Enforcement Officers. The Queen recently celebrated her 96th birthday privately in Sandringham, but recent mobility issues have prevented her from attending a variety of public ceremonies over the last few months -including church services over Easter. Her only public appearance this year, outside of her own residences or on video, was at the recent Thanksgiving Service for Prince Philip at Westminster Abbey. A number of commemorative items are being produced to mark the Jubilee. Among them is aBarbie doll, featuring a recreation of her wedding tiara and an ivory gown fitted with a blue ribbon. Plans for a 70ft (21m) sculpture containing 350 native British trees to beerected outside Buckingham Palace have also been announced.

Zara threatens legal action over boutique name,"Amber Kotrri refuses to rename her business and insists there is no risk of confusion An independent fashion boutique is due to face high street clothing company Zara at a tribunal over claims it is an ""identical brand"". Darlington-based House of Zana has been threatened with legal action by the Spanish fashion giant which claims the brand is ""conceptually identical"". Lawyers want Amber Kotrri, who opened her store in 2019 after trading online, to change its name and branding. Mrs Kotrri said doing that would be ""the last thing we want to do"". She received a notice of opposition from Zara when she tried to trademark the name House of Zana, followed by a letter from the multi-national company's lawyers that argued the County Durham business was ""confusingly similar"" for customers. The letter went on to say the name House of Zana ""dilutes the distinctiveness and reputation of the Zara brand"". Mrs Kotrri was asked to rename her business and remove all existing branding, but she refused. She said there was ""no risk of confusing us with Zara"" and the change would ""cause irreparable damage"" to her business. Amber Kotrri says her business is named after the Albanian word for fairy Mrs Kotrri started the business while living with her husband in Albania. She said: ""Our name is very meaningful and personal to us and poses no commercial threat to Zara, and their massive market. ""We don't believe anyone has or will confuse House of Zana with Zara. We're a small business that specialises in handmade kimonos. We have one small concept store in the North East of England and a website to help promote our products."" The final hearing to decide whether she can keep the name House of Zana is due to take place next month. Zara's owner Inditex said it had opposed Mrs Kotrri's trademark application ""because of its similarity to Zara's brand name"". A spokesperson said: ""We wish the business every success and we continue to make efforts to reach the business directly so we can resolve the situation amicably.""

Twitter shares halted as reports say Musk deal close,"Trading in Twitter's shares have been halted amid reports the firm could agree a takeover deal with Elon Musk as early as Monday. The board of the social media giant is reported to have met with Mr Musk over the weekend to discuss his $43bn offer. Twitter had initially rebuffed the billionaire's approach. Butaccording to reports,external, Twitter is now in the final stages of negotiations with Mr Musk to buy the business. Reuters, the news agency, reported that an announcement may come later on Monday after Twitter's board met and recommended a deal to its shareholders. In trading earlier on Monday, shares rose more than 5%, approaching Mr Musk's offer price of $54.20 a share. Mr Musk's targeting of Twitter has moved at remarkable speed. It emerged at the beginning of April that Mr Musk, who is the boss of electric carmaker Tesla, had become the largest shareholder in Twitter with a 9.2% stake. He was then invited to join Twitter's board but turned down the offer before launching a surprise bid for the company on 14 April, saying he wantedto ""unlock"" the social media platform's ""extraordinary potential"". Twitter responded by putting in place a so-called ""poison pill"" defence to fend off Mr Musk. The mechanism would have created difficulties for Mr Musk if he attempted to increase his stake in the company. The board now appears to have U-turned after Mr Musk revealed he had lined up a $46.5bn financing package for his offer - with funding from a mixture of his own assets and the backing of Wall Street banking giant Morgan Stanley and other firms. Mr Musk recently said that he believes that Twitter should be more open and transparent. ""I think it's very important for there to be an inclusive arena for free speech,"" he told the TED2022 conference in Vancouver. The billionaire, who is the world's richest man according to Forbes magazine, has also hinted at his plans for Twitter. He asked his 83.3 million followers on Twitter if the social media platform should allow people to edit their posts - 74% of those who responded wanted an edit button. Mr Musk's has also criticised Twitter's process of verifying a Twitter account which he said was like ""if Kafka had a Magic 8-Ball!"". Even Twitter itself didn't appear to take Elon Musk seriously when he first said that he wanted to buy it. It's just Musk being, well, Musk, everyone thought. He may be the world's richest man but he is also by his own admission cash-poor - and he is well-versed in posting unsubstantiated grand ideas on social media. But underestimate him at your peril. He is a multi-billionaire and Twitter is one of his favourite toys - so he's come back with a funded $43bn offer that the firm's shareholders are now looking likely to accept. Twitter hasn't explicitly explained why it didn't initially want to become part of Mr Musk's empire. Certainly any social media firm with regulators breathing down their necks is going to be wary of a new owner who wants to ""open up"" the platform to more freedom of speech and less moderation. He's also keen on subscription rather than advertising as a business model, which may prove a hard sell for a platform that has not experienced significant user growth in ages. A Musk-owned Twitter would have a very different feel, for sure. But he also brings to it his own brand of magic -criticise him on social media and you'll soon bear the brunt of devoted fans who idolise him. Twitter may decide to try to find an alternative buyer but Musk's star quality would be difficult to substitute. He also recently tweeted: ""If our Twitter bid succeeds, we will defeat the spam bots or die trying""â¦..And authenticate all real humans."" Allow Twitter content?

It is not clear who would run Twitter if Mr Musk's bid succeeds. He is the chief executive as well as the ""Technoking"" of Tesla according to the company's website. He is also chief executive, chief technology officer and chairman of rocket and spacecraft firm SpaceX. Mr Musk is also involved in a number of other businesses and start-ups. Twitter is led by chief executive Parag Agrawal, who took on the role last November with the backing of co-founder and former boss Jack Dorsey. At the time, Mr Dorsey said: ""My trust in Parag as Twitter's chief executive is deep. I'm deeply grateful for his skill, heart, and soul. It's his time to lead."" Mr Musk has been critical of Twitter's management. In his offer document, he told Twitter's chairman Bret Taylor: ""I don't have confidence in management."" Mr Agrawal has not discussed the takeover on the platform since earlier this month, when he announced that Mr Musk had turned down an offer to sit on the company's board, a decision he said would be ""for the best"".

Why Elon Musk has been so keen to buy Twitter,"Elon Musk says he wants to see Twitter fulfil its ""extraordinary potential"" At first, the story of Twitter and Elon Musk feels a little like a tale of unrequited love. Our unlikely couple starts out with an imbalance of power. Elon Musk loves Twitter. He has an enormous audience of 83.8m followers. He tweets prolifically, sometimes controversially, occasionally catastrophically. The SEC banned him from tweeting about Tesla affairs afterone tweet wiped $14bn off its share price, and he was sued for defamation following a tweet about a cave diver in which he called him ""pedo guy"" (the cave diver lost). But he has never strayed far from his keyboard. Twitter on the other hand is far less effusive about Elon Musk. You might think, if someone offered you $44bn for a 16-year-old business that hadn't really enjoyed the exponential growth of its rivals, they were doing you a favour - and Twitter's shareholders seem inclined to agree. He wants to see Twitter fulfil its ""extraordinary potential"", he says - and he's not even that interested in making money out of it. He has plenty of that already, and multi-billionaires can afford to have different priorities. Twitter responded by going straight on the defensive, deploying a""poison pill""strategy which prevented anybody from owning more than 15% of its shares while Musk circled,though a deal has now been agreed. Why? Perhaps the board was unnerved by Musk's declaration that he wanted to see more ""free speech"" and less moderation. Many Republicans, who have long felt that Twitter's moderation policies favour the freedom of speech of left-leaning viewpoints, rejoiced. But regulators around the world are lining up to crack down on social networks and force them to take more responsibility for the content they carry, issuing steep fines for non-compliance on material that incites violence, or is abusive, or classifies as hate speech, among other things. You can hear the alarm bells start to ring. Could Musk use Twitter to incentivise payments in volatile, unprotected currencies such as Bitcoin? Let's not forget the finances. Twitter's main business model is ad-based - and Musk wants to change that. He's more interested in subscriptions, he claims, which could prove a hard sell in an environment where all the main social networks are free-to-use. Twitter users may decide they prefer for their data to not be used to monetise them and they're willing to pay for that - but it's a gamble. He also likes crypto-currencies. Could he use the platform to incentivise payments in volatile, unprotected currencies such as Bitcoin? And then there's Musk himself. He's the richest man in the world, a serial entrepreneur whose successes include PayPal and Tesla. He's charismatic and unfiltered - which can make him a very loose cannon indeed. He likes to test boundaries and break rules. There's a reason why he declined to join Twitter's boardafter buying a 9.2% stake in January- he didn't want to be bound by the responsibility. And he has an army of loyal fans who adore him - I once tweeted about the fact that, because of the way his finances are structured (his wealth is largely shares-based rather than cash income, and he doesn't own property) - he doesn't pay income tax. How dare I suggest that he might, he's brilliant and we should simply be grateful for him, came the replies. He has not exactly wooed Twitter with flowers and chocolates, this has been an aggressive bid from an aggressive businessman - no negotiation, no compromise. It's not a merger between two giants so there is unlikely to be much in the way of regulatory obstacles. Musk's Twitter would be a very different landscape for the 300 million people who continue to use it, if indeed they do. More feisty, perhaps, and less liberal-leaning. He could reinstate Donald Trump, whocurrently has a permanent ban,external- and given that Mr Trump's own attempt at a social network, Truth Social,appears to be floundering, he would probably be delighted to return. It's hard to summarise the collective view of Twitter's users. In my unscientific observation, for every tweet welcoming Musk, there seems to be another threatening to leave. But then - since when did Twitter users ever agree on anything?

It was the seventh year in which the total had risen, the report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute said. The rise in military spending is set to continue, as European countries build up their armed forces in response to Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine. The US spent more than $800bn on its military last year, more than double that of any other country. Russia increased its military spending by nearly 3%, helped by higher oil and gas revenues, as it built up its forces on the Ukrainian border. Finland and Sweden are gearing up to announce at the same time in May that they want to join Nato, Finnish and Swedish tabloids have reported. Both countries are militarily non-aligned but Russia's invasion of Ukraine has prompted increasing public support for joining the Western defensive alliance. Finnish newspaper Iltalehti says it believes the leaders of Finland and Sweden plan to meet in the week of 16 May and then announce that they will apply to join Nato. Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto declined to comment. The Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet, citing unnamed sources, also said it believed the two countries would make announcements that week, at the same time as each other. Russia has warned of a nuclear build-up in the Baltic should Finland and Sweden join Nato. Reality Check A MiG-29 on display at an air base in india India has been under pressure to help isolate Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. But it has long-standing defence ties to Moscow. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, visiting the US, has said that while India would like to be a âgood friendâ to Western countries, it needed to protect its interests and ensure its security. Data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri), shows that India is one of the worldâs largest buyers of weapons. And since 1992, about two-thirds of its military equipment has come from Russia. It has diversified its sources of weapons in recent years, buying more equipment from other countries. But if you look at the period from 2016 to 2021, Russia continued to be by far the largest supplier of weapons to India, accounting for twice as much as the next biggest supplier, France. Alina Kabaeva is a 38-year old Olympic gold medalist White House press secretary Jen Psaki denied at Monday's daily press briefing the US was deliberately holding off on sanctioning the woman believed to be Putin's girlfriend. ""We're continuing to review sanctions,"" Psaki said when asked why Russian politician and ex-gymnast Alina Kabaeva had not yet been targeted. ""No-one is safe from our sanctions,"" Psaki continued. ""We've already of course sanctioned President Putin, but also his daughter and his closest cronies, and we will continue to review more,"" she added. Calls have been rising for the US to sanction the 38-year old Olympic gold medalist, as the US has done to Putin's two adult daughters. Putin is known for being intensely private about his personal life, and has never acknowledged any romantic relationship with Russia's ""secret first lady"", as she has been dubbed in the Russian and foreign press. According to a Wall Street Journal report, US officials have withheld sanctions on Kabaeva due to concerns that Putin would view it as a personal attack. It would be viewed as ""so personal a blow to Mr Putin that it could further escalate tensions between Russia and the US"", the Journal wrote. An railway electricity substation near Lviv was damaged in a Russian strike aimed at halting the supply of foreign weapons If you're just joining us, here's a round-up of the latest events in Ukraine.  Lavrov also acknowledged there's a possibility of the conflict escalating to nuclear weapons, though he also sounded a hopeful note about the prospects of a peace accord. Speaking to the Russian First Channel on Monday, he said Moscow wanted to avoid ""artificially"" elevated risks of such a conflict. ""This is our key position on which we base everything. The risks now are considerable,"" Lavrov said. ""I would not want to elevate those risks artificially. Many would like that. The danger is serious, real, And we must not underestimate it."" Lavrov also accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine of ""pretending"" to negotiate, calling him ""a good actorâ. ""If you watch attentively and read attentively what he says, you'll find a thousand contradictions,"" Russiaâs top diplomat said. The foreign minister said last week that Moscow was committed to avoiding a nuclear war. On Monday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted that Lavrovâs latest comments were an indication Russia had lost its ""last hope to scare the world off supporting Ukraineâ. ""Thus the talk of a ârealâ danger of WWIII. This only means Moscow senses defeat in Ukraine,"" he tweeted. Days after the invasion began back on 24 February, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his nuclear forces to be on alert. The US and its Nato allies have said they do not want direct military intervention in Ukraine, in order to avoid the risks of a Third World War. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said deliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the Nato alliance is ""in essence engaged in war with Russiaâ. In an interview aired on Monday, he said: ""These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russiaâs military acting within the context of the special operation.â Lavrov also told state television: ""Nato, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war."" In his nightly video address to the nation, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says that Ukraine's victory is inevitable, but it is impossible to predict when the war will conclude. ""Many cities and communities are still under the temporary control of the Russian army,"" he says in his address. ""But I have no doubt that it is only a matter of time before we liberate our land."" Earlier in his address, he marked the fact that the invasion, which began on 24 February, has just surpassed the three-month mark. Zelensky goes on to say that there is ""no simple answer"" to the question of when Ukraine will defeat the Russians, adding that victory - and peace - will come more quickly if every Ukrainian fights. ""When we gain a victory, everyone will feel it. When peace comes, everyone will see it. ""But for this to happen - and happen faster - we need to think not about when and what it will be. We must think every day about how to make the stay of the occupiers on our land even more unbearable."" ""For Russia to seek peace, every Ukrainian must still fight,"" he continues. ""They must defend freedom. Because every day of struggle now adds years of peaceful life after this war. After our victory."" This ambulance was one of 20 donated earlier this month to the war-torn country The UK is donating 22 new ambulances and medical equipment to Ukraine following a request from the government there, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced. It comes just weeks after a shipment of 20 ambulances was sent to the country, as it battles against the Russian invasion. Medical aid charity UK-Med, which works on the front line of disasters around the world, has been given Â£300,000 of funding to train Ukrainian doctors, nurses and paramedics in dealing with mass casualties. The charity has also been given Â£300,000 of medicines and other pharmaceutical supplies to bring to Ukrainian medical staff. More than 40 fire engines have already arrived in Ukraine from the UK, after the nation saw more than 100 of its fire stations and 250 fire engines destroyed in the war. Steve RosenbergRussia editor, reporting from Bryansk Plumes of smoke were captured rising into the sky from the oil depot in Bryansk on a video on social media The city of Bryansk is a hundred miles from Russiaâs border
with Ukraine. But today it looked like it was on the front line. Plumes of
thick black smoke dominated the skyline - the consequence of fires overnight.
First one fuel depot erupting in flames, and then another. The cause? Well, thereâs been no official explanation - there
is, however, much speculation. Was this the result of a Ukrainian strike to
disrupt logistics for Russiaâs military offensive? Was it sabotage by Russian
opponents of the Kremlinâs so-called special military operation? Neither Moscow
nor Kyiv is saying. Whatever the cause, the fires have sparked concern amongst
the Russian public. Here are some of the things people told me on the streets
of Bryansk: âThis never happened before. At 3am we heard explosions.
Weâre amazed.â âI donât know what this is. Is it war here? Well, I suppose
weâre on the front line. I wonder if Ukraine did this..?â We have seen something similar in Belgorod, earlier this
month. Another blaze at another Russian fuel depot near the border. Russia
claimed Ukrainian helicopter gunships had opened fire. Kyiv wouldnât confirm
it. But one thing is clear. Despite President Putinâs claims
that he sent his troops into Ukraine to bring Russians security, there is
little sign of that. Electronic equipment which could be used to intercept communications and spy on Ukrainians is the latest category of products to be banned by the UK for export to Russia. The Department for International Trade also announced the UK would remove tariffs and quotes on products from Ukraine, responding to a request from President Volodymyr Zelensky to support the country's economy as it defends itself from invasion. The decision would affect key Ukrainian exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry, the UK said. Tariffs will be lifted for 12 months initially, but could be extended. As well as equipment used to intercept and monitor communications, the UK has previously banned the export of luxury goods, aviation and space equipment, oil refining items and advanced technologies such as quantum computing. Jonathan BealeDefence correspondent, reporting from Donbas Lieutenant Denys Gordeev is used to war, but not like this. ""It's become much harder,"" he says. ""We have bomb attacks, rocket attacks every day, all the time, every hour."" Though he has spent eight years battling Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas, now he and his men are facing the full might of the Russian army. After its retreat from Kyiv three weeks ago, Russia has refocused its military efforts in Eastern Ukraine - with its goal of taking the whole of the Donbas region. It has redeployed many of its units to the east. Western officials estimate that Russia now has about 76 Battalion Tactical Groups in the region - each of which has about 800 men. They also say there's some evidence Russia's been addressing some of its early mistakes, helped by the fact they're now fighting on fewer fronts, and under a unified command. The result is that Ukrainian forces are struggling to hold a 300-mile front in the Donbas. They've already lost ground to the Russians and are likely to lose more in the days ahead. Russian forces have been conducting probing attacks to find weak points in Ukraine's defences. For now the invading army is mostly using its artillery and rockets to grind down Ukraine's defences. Some military analysts expect a major assault is still to come. And Ukrainian forces, including Lt Gordeev and his unit, appear to be holding the line, although Western experts say they are already outnumbered three to one. Read the full report here. Now some news from Kherson, the only major city that Russian forces have taken and continued to occupy. Its Ukrainian mayor, Ihor Kolykhayev, has reported on Facebook that Russian armed men took control of the city council building on Monday. Although Kherson has been under Russian occupation since early March, the city council had still been functioning under Ukrainian control. Kolykhayev said the Russian military took away the keys to the building and exchanged the security guards for guards of their own. He said he left the building at 19.45 local time. Pravda, a Ukrainian news outlet, reported that from 26 April, Kherson city council would not be functioning. It added that the mayor and employees of the city council were given the chance to go home. Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has said his government has sent tanks to Ukraine. During an interview with private broadcaster Polsat News, Morawiecki was asked if Poland has sent, or will send, tanks to Ukraine. He replied ""yes"", without giving further details. He said he would announce more information âin due courseâ but for the time being he wouldn't reveal how many tanks have been supplied for security reasons. For several weeks now, itâs been rumoured that Poland has been supplying Ukraine with Soviet-era T-72 tanks. The Ministry of Defence had refused to comment on the rumours. Morawiecki said that the matter of Poland supplying Ukraine with Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets is now âclosedâ. In March, Poland said it was ready to deploy the jets to the US Ramstein Air Base in Germany and put them at the disposal of the US military, but Washington rejected the offer. âThere is no such necessity, there are no such demands, no such requests,â he said, when asked if sending planes to Ukraine was still being considered. Several explosions have hit the state security ministry in the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria, the interior ministry said on its Telegram channel. The ministry said the building appeared to have been hit with rocket-propelled grenades, but it said no one was injured. It comes days after a Russian general suggested Moscow wanted totake full control of southern Ukraine, giving Russia access to the separatist region of Moldova which it supports. He said there was ""oppression of the Russian-speaking population"" in Transnistria, a claim which had also been made - without evidence - to justify the invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine's defence ministry saidthe incident was a ""planned provocation"" by Russia itself to instil ""panic and anti-Ukrainian sentiment"",external. A small Russian-speaking breakaway region, Transnistria borders Ukraine from the west. It claimed independence after the fall of the Soviet Union in a bloody conflict, but is not recognised internationally and officially remains part of Moldova. A senior Russian diplomat has said a ceasefire is not a good option at the moment, because it will give Ukrainian forces the chance to ""regroup and to stage more provocations"". Earlier today, Russia announced that it would be holding a ceasefire around the steelworks in the besieged city of Mariupol from 14:00 local time (11:00 GMT), to allow civilians to leave. But Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said no agreement had been reached and called for written security guarantees. Russia's first deputy permanent representative to the UN, Dmitry Polyanskiy, said Ukraine had claimed that there were some civilians in the Azovstal steel plant, where the last Ukrainian fighters in the city are holed up, but Ukrainian forces ""did not let them go"". He went on to say that Russia had not attacked residential areas in Odesa, Ukraine's Black Sea port city, over the weekend. On Saturday, Ukraine said that two missiles struck a military facility and two residential buildings in the city. But Polyanskiy said the residential buildings were hit by Ukraine air defences. He went on to reject the comments made by US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, who said Russia had failed to achieve its aims in the invasion. Polyanskiy said: ""I don't think we failed, frankly."" He added that Russia is conducting its ""military operation"" and it has ""its own aims"" and ""its own strategies"". Nikita, Oleksandr and Vira have been living in a succession of temporary lodgings as they wait for news of a visa A disabled teenaged refugee from Ukraine and his grandparents have been stuck in Paris for more than six weeks as they wait for their UK visa application to be processed. Kateryna Karpenko persuaded her nephew Nikita Shepel, and her parents Oleksandr and Vira, to flee Russian shelling and apply to come to join her in the UK, where she has lived for almost 10 years. But amid complaints that the UK Home Office has conducted a chaotic and overly-bureaucratic response to the Ukrainian refugee crisis, the estimated five working day wait for a visa has turned into more than a month in limbo, costing them thousands of pounds in accommodation. ""They had to go through a lot, fleeing Ukraine, and they have no idea what's happening with our home, our family, our lives,"" says Kateryna. A UK government spokesman said changes the Home Office has made to the system, including simpler forms and increase staff numbers, are working. Read more  US President Joe Biden has named the veteran diplomat Bridget Brink as the new US ambassador to Ukraine. Earlier today, the White House announced that Brink would be moving to fill ""a crucial position"", which has been vacant for the past three years. Washington said Brink's appointment came at a time when the US was ramping up its support for Ukraine, amid Russia's invasion. The new ambassador is currently serving as the US ambassador to Slovakia and has been a diplomat for 25 years. The White House added that Brink's ""decades of
experience make her uniquely suited for this moment in Ukraineâs
history"". A firefighter surveys the damage at an electricity substation powering the railway near Lviv We've been bringing you updates on the reports of attacks on railway infrastructure in Ukraine, which Ukrainian officials say killed five people. Earlier, Ukraine said Russia was trying to disrupt supply lines for military equipment from foreign countries. Now Russia has confirmed that was the purpose of the attacks, according to Reuters. The news agency is citing a statement from the Russian defence ministry, saying its missiles destroyed six facilities powering the railways that were used to supply Ukrainian forces with weapons from abroad. Ukrainian officials said five railway stations in the centre and west of the country came under attack within an hour this morning. An electricity substation powering overhead lines in Krasne, near Lviv, was also hit in a missile strike. Ukraine's defence minister has thanked the US for their military assistance - describing the relationship between the two nation's as as a ""true brotherhood"". Oleksii Reznikov's comments on Twitter follow the visit to Kyiv on Sunday by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. Mr Reznikov said the support given by the Biden administration is ""not measured in money, but in the saved lives of Ukrainians"". During the visit, it was announced that US diplomats will begin returning to Ukraine and the Washington will provide Ukraine with a further $700m in military aid. Mr Reznikov also shared a video where he can be seen shaking hands and embracing Austin, accompanied by the caption: ""This is more than partnership of state officials - this is true brotherhood.""

"Twitter board agrees to $44bn takeover by Elon MuskMr Musk, who made the shock bid just over a week ago, said he would ""unlock"" the social media firm's potential.Business","The board of Twitter has agreed to a $44bn (Â£34.5bn) takeover offer from the billionaire Elon Musk.

The firm initially rebuffed Mr Musk's bid, but it will now ask shareholders to vote to approve the deal.

""It will be interesting to see how a privately owned Twitter (run by a man who is an absolutist over free speech) will react to global moves to regulate."" BBC environment analyst Roger Harrabin says scientists are nervous about the potential impact of the takeover on the climate debate. He notes that Twitter announced last week it would ban advertisements that deny the scientific consensus on the climate crisis, with the firm admitting that misleading information can undermine efforts to protect the planet. Mr Musk, who has more than 80 million followers on Twitter, has a controversial history on the platform himself. In 2018 US financial regulators accused him of misleading Tesla investors with his tweets, claims that were resolved in a $40 million settlement and that Mr Musk continues to deny. And in 2019 he was hit with a defamation suit - which he successfully defeated - after calling a diver involved in rescuing schoolboys in Thailand ""pedo guy"" on the platform. On Monday, Mr Musk, who has been known to clash with journalists and block critics, suggested that he saw Twitter as a forum for debate. ""I hope that even my worst critics remain on Twitter, because that is what free speech means,"" he wrote just hours before the deal was announced. As part of the takeover, which is expected to close later this year, Twitter's shares will be delisted and it will be taken private. Mr Musk has suggested this will give him freedom to make the changes he wants to the business. Among other ideas, he has suggested allowing longer posts and introducing the ability to edit them after they have been published. Twitter shares on Monday closed more than 5% higher after the deal was announced. But the price remained lower than Mr Musk's $54.20 per share offer, a sign that Wall Street believes he is overpaying for the firm. Mr Musk has said he doesn't ""care about the economics"" of the purchase. However, he will take on a company with a chequered record of financial performance. Despite its influence, Twitter has rarely turned a profit and user growth, particularly in the US, has slowed. The company, founded in 2004, ended 2021 with $5bn in revenue and 217 million daily users globally - a fraction of the figures claimed by other platforms such as Facebook. Bret Taylor, chair of Twitter's board, said it had fully assessed Mr Musk's offer and it was ""the best path forward for Twitter's stockholders"". Parag Agrawal succeeded Twitter co-founder Jack Dorsey in November It is not clear who will lead the company moving forward. Twitter is currently led by Parag Agrawal, who took over from co-founder and former boss Jack Dorsey last November. But in his offer document, Mr Musk told Twitter's board: ""I don't have confidence in management."" Mr Agrawal told employees on Monday that the future of Twitter is uncertain. ""Once the deal closes, we don't know which direction the platform will go,"" he said, according to the Reuters news agency. Mr Musk's targeting of Twitter has moved at remarkable speed. It emerged at the beginning of April that he had become the largest shareholder in the firm with a 9.2% stake. He was then invited to join Twitter's board but turned down the offer before launching a surprise bid for the company on 14 April, saying he wantedto ""unlock"" its potential as a bastion of freedom of speech. Twitter tried to fend off his bid, threatening to dilute the shareholdings of anyone who bought more than a 15% stake in the firm. However, its stance shifted after Mr Musk revealed more financial details about his proposed bid. He has secured $25.5bn of financing for the deal and will take a $21bn stake in the business. The board unanimously approved the bid, which will now be presented to shareholders for a vote. The speed this move has happened at had many heads in Silicon Valley spinning. From nowhere, Elon Musk is the absolute monarch of Twitter. He himself has said it's not about the ""economics"", this is about power and influence. By taking the company private he will exercise total control over Twitter. He has the power to do with the company as he pleases. In practice that will mean a much lighter moderation policy. He also says that he will make its algorithm public - so that people can better understand how Twitter works. The move leaves the door open to Donald Trump's return to the platform, though he apparently says he would rather use his own social media platform Truth Social for now. For years conservatives have argued that Twitter is biased against them - and the news has left Republicans in the US delighted. Others have been left dismayed at what Twitter might look like without strong platform moderation. You only need to look at how much criticism Facebook has received for not taking down groups linked to the QAnon conspiracy theory, or the Stop the Steal movement to imagine how much criticism Elon Musk is in store for. The danger that Twitter now faces is that unfettered free speech on social media can become very ugly, very quickly. This video can not be played Who is Elon Musk?

""Once the deal closes, we don't know which direction the platform will go,"" he said, according to the Reuters news agency. Mr Musk's targeting of Twitter has moved at remarkable speed. It emerged at the beginning of April that he had become the largest shareholder in the firm with a 9.2% stake. He was then invited to join Twitter's board but turned down the offer before launching a surprise bid for the company on 14 April, saying he wantedto ""unlock"" its potential as a bastion of freedom of speech. Twitter tried to fend off his bid, threatening to dilute the shareholdings of anyone who bought more than a 15% stake in the firm. However, its stance shifted after Mr Musk revealed more financial details about his proposed bid. He has secured $25.5bn of financing for the deal and will take a $21bn stake in the business. The board unanimously approved the bid, which will now be presented to shareholders for a vote. The speed this move has happened at had many heads in Silicon Valley spinning. From nowhere, Elon Musk is the absolute monarch of Twitter. He himself has said it's not about the ""economics"", this is about power and influence. By taking the company private he will exercise total control over Twitter. He has the power to do with the company as he pleases. In practice that will mean a much lighter moderation policy. He also says that he will make its algorithm public - so that people can better understand how Twitter works. The move leaves the door open to Donald Trump's return to the platform, though he apparently says he would rather use his own social media platform Truth Social for now. For years conservatives have argued that Twitter is biased against them - and the news has left Republicans in the US delighted. Others have been left dismayed at what Twitter might look like without strong platform moderation. You only need to look at how much criticism Facebook has received for not taking down groups linked to the QAnon conspiracy theory, or the Stop the Steal movement to imagine how much criticism Elon Musk is in store for. The danger that Twitter now faces is that unfettered free speech on social media can become very ugly, very quickly. This video can not be played Who is Elon Musk?

LiveLiveRailway strikes targeted arms supply routes - Russia7 minutes ago,"Russia says it has destroyed six substations powering Ukrainian railways used to transport foreign weapons Ukraine's armed forces say Russia is targeting rail junctions to hit military supply routes At least five people in central Ukraine were killed in the attacks, Ukrainian officials say About 15,000 Russian troops have been killed since Russia invaded Ukraine, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace says US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Russia is trying to brutalise parts of Ukraine but failing in its war aims He was speaking after meeting President Zelensky in Kyiv on Sunday US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, who also went to Kyiv, said the US wanted to see Russia militarily weakened Edited by Jude Sheerin Theo LeggettBBC International Business Correspondent Global military spending exceeded $2tn (Â£1.6tn) for the first time in 2021, with Russia's increased significantly, a new report says. It was the seventh year in which the total had risen, the report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute said. The rise in military spending is set to continue, as European countries build up their armed forces in response to Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine. The US spent more than $800bn on its military last year, more than double that of any other country. Russia increased its military spending by nearly 3%, helped by higher oil and gas revenues, as it built up its forces on the Ukrainian border. Finland and Sweden are gearing up to announce at the same time in May that they want to join Nato, Finnish and Swedish tabloids have reported. Both countries are militarily non-aligned but Russia's invasion of Ukraine has prompted increasing public support for joining the Western defensive alliance. Finnish newspaper Iltalehti says it believes the leaders of Finland and Sweden plan to meet in the week of 16 May and then announce that they will apply to join Nato. Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto declined to comment. The Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet, citing unnamed sources, also said it believed the two countries would make announcements that week, at the same time as each other. Russia has warned of a nuclear build-up in the Baltic should Finland and Sweden join Nato. Reality Check A MiG-29 on display at an air base in india India has been under pressure to help isolate Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. But it has long-standing defence ties to Moscow. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, visiting the US, has said that while India would like to be a âgood friendâ to Western countries, it needed to protect its interests and ensure its security. Data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri), shows that India is one of the worldâs largest buyers of weapons. And since 1992, about two-thirds of its military equipment has come from Russia. It has diversified its sources of weapons in recent years, buying more equipment from other countries. But if you look at the period from 2016 to 2021, Russia continued to be by far the largest supplier of weapons to India, accounting for twice as much as the next biggest supplier, France. Alina Kabaeva is a 38-year old Olympic gold medalist White House press secretary Jen Psaki denied at Monday's daily press briefing the US was deliberately holding off on sanctioning the woman believed to be Putin's girlfriend. ""We're continuing to review sanctions,"" Psaki said when asked why Russian politician and ex-gymnast Alina Kabaeva had not yet been targeted. ""No-one is safe from our sanctions,"" Psaki continued. ""We've already of course sanctioned President Putin, but also his daughter and his closest cronies, and we will continue to review more,"" she added. Calls have been rising for the US to sanction the 38-year old Olympic gold medalist, as the US has done to Putin's two adult daughters. Putin is known for being intensely private about his personal life, and has never acknowledged any romantic relationship with Russia's ""secret first lady"", as she has been dubbed in the Russian and foreign press. According to a Wall Street Journal report, US officials have withheld sanctions on Kabaeva due to concerns that Putin would view it as a personal attack. It would be viewed as ""so personal a blow to Mr Putin that it could further escalate tensions between Russia and the US"", the Journal wrote. An railway electricity substation near Lviv was damaged in a Russian strike aimed at halting the supply of foreign weapons If you're just joining us, here's a round-up of the latest events in Ukraine.  Lavrov also acknowledged there's a possibility of the conflict escalating to nuclear weapons, though he also sounded a hopeful note about the prospects of a peace accord. Speaking to the Russian First Channel on Monday, he said Moscow wanted to avoid ""artificially"" elevated risks of such a conflict. ""This is our key position on which we base everything. The risks now are considerable,"" Lavrov said. ""I would not want to elevate those risks artificially. Many would like that. The danger is serious, real, And we must not underestimate it."" Lavrov also accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine of ""pretending"" to negotiate, calling him ""a good actorâ. ""If you watch attentively and read attentively what he says, you'll find a thousand contradictions,"" Russiaâs top diplomat said. The foreign minister said last week that Moscow was committed to avoiding a nuclear war. On Monday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted that Lavrovâs latest comments were an indication Russia had lost its ""last hope to scare the world off supporting Ukraineâ. ""Thus the talk of a ârealâ danger of WWIII. This only means Moscow senses defeat in Ukraine,"" he tweeted. Days after the invasion began back on 24 February, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his nuclear forces to be on alert. The US and its Nato allies have said they do not want direct military intervention in Ukraine, in order to avoid the risks of a Third World War. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said deliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the Nato alliance is ""in essence engaged in war with Russiaâ. In an interview aired on Monday, he said: ""These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russiaâs military acting within the context of the special operation.â Lavrov also told state television: ""Nato, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war."" In his nightly video address to the nation, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says that Ukraine's victory is inevitable, but it is impossible to predict when the war will conclude. ""Many cities and communities are still under the temporary control of the Russian army,"" he says in his address. ""But I have no doubt that it is only a matter of time before we liberate our land."" Earlier in his address, he marked the fact that the invasion, which began on 24 February, has just surpassed the three-month mark. Zelensky goes on to say that there is ""no simple answer"" to the question of when Ukraine will defeat the Russians, adding that victory - and peace - will come more quickly if every Ukrainian fights. ""When we gain a victory, everyone will feel it. When peace comes, everyone will see it. ""But for this to happen - and happen faster - we need to think not about when and what it will be. We must think every day about how to make the stay of the occupiers on our land even more unbearable."" ""For Russia to seek peace, every Ukrainian must still fight,"" he continues. ""They must defend freedom. Because every day of struggle now adds years of peaceful life after this war. After our victory."" This ambulance was one of 20 donated earlier this month to the war-torn country The UK is donating 22 new ambulances and medical equipment to Ukraine following a request from the government there, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced. It comes just weeks after a shipment of 20 ambulances was sent to the country, as it battles against the Russian invasion. Medical aid charity UK-Med, which works on the front line of disasters around the world, has been given Â£300,000 of funding to train Ukrainian doctors, nurses and paramedics in dealing with mass casualties. The charity has also been given Â£300,000 of medicines and other pharmaceutical supplies to bring to Ukrainian medical staff. More than 40 fire engines have already arrived in Ukraine from the UK, after the nation saw more than 100 of its fire stations and 250 fire engines destroyed in the war. Steve RosenbergRussia editor, reporting from Bryansk Plumes of smoke were captured rising into the sky from the oil depot in Bryansk on a video on social media The city of Bryansk is a hundred miles from Russiaâs border
with Ukraine. But today it looked like it was on the front line. Plumes of
thick black smoke dominated the skyline - the consequence of fires overnight.
First one fuel depot erupting in flames, and then another. The cause? Well, thereâs been no official explanation - there
is, however, much speculation. Was this the result of a Ukrainian strike to
disrupt logistics for Russiaâs military offensive? Was it sabotage by Russian
opponents of the Kremlinâs so-called special military operation? Neither Moscow
nor Kyiv is saying. Whatever the cause, the fires have sparked concern amongst
the Russian public. Here are some of the things people told me on the streets
of Bryansk: âThis never happened before. At 3am we heard explosions.
Weâre amazed.â âI donât know what this is. Is it war here? Well, I suppose
weâre on the front line. I wonder if Ukraine did this..?â We have seen something similar in Belgorod, earlier this
month. Another blaze at another Russian fuel depot near the border. Russia
claimed Ukrainian helicopter gunships had opened fire. Kyiv wouldnât confirm
it. But one thing is clear. Despite President Putinâs claims
that he sent his troops into Ukraine to bring Russians security, there is
little sign of that. Electronic equipment which could be used to intercept communications and spy on Ukrainians is the latest category of products to be banned by the UK for export to Russia. The Department for International Trade also announced the UK would remove tariffs and quotes on products from Ukraine, responding to a request from President Volodymyr Zelensky to support the country's economy as it defends itself from invasion. The decision would affect key Ukrainian exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry, the UK said. Tariffs will be lifted for 12 months initially, but could be extended. As well as equipment used to intercept and monitor communications, the UK has previously banned the export of luxury goods, aviation and space equipment, oil refining items and advanced technologies such as quantum computing. Jonathan BealeDefence correspondent, reporting from Donbas Lieutenant Denys Gordeev is used to war, but not like this. ""It's become much harder,"" he says. ""We have bomb attacks, rocket attacks every day, all the time, every hour."" Though he has spent eight years battling Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas, now he and his men are facing the full might of the Russian army. After its retreat from Kyiv three weeks ago, Russia has refocused its military efforts in Eastern Ukraine - with its goal of taking the whole of the Donbas region. It has redeployed many of its units to the east. Western officials estimate that Russia now has about 76 Battalion Tactical Groups in the region - each of which has about 800 men. They also say there's some evidence Russia's been addressing some of its early mistakes, helped by the fact they're now fighting on fewer fronts, and under a unified command. The result is that Ukrainian forces are struggling to hold a 300-mile front in the Donbas. They've already lost ground to the Russians and are likely to lose more in the days ahead. Russian forces have been conducting probing attacks to find weak points in Ukraine's defences. For now the invading army is mostly using its artillery and rockets to grind down Ukraine's defences. Some military analysts expect a major assault is still to come. And Ukrainian forces, including Lt Gordeev and his unit, appear to be holding the line, although Western experts say they are already outnumbered three to one. Read the full report here. Now some news from Kherson, the only major city that Russian forces have taken and continued to occupy. Its Ukrainian mayor, Ihor Kolykhayev, has reported on Facebook that Russian armed men took control of the city council building on Monday. Although Kherson has been under Russian occupation since early March, the city council had still been functioning under Ukrainian control. Kolykhayev said the Russian military took away the keys to the building and exchanged the security guards for guards of their own. He said he left the building at 19.45 local time. Pravda, a Ukrainian news outlet, reported that from 26 April, Kherson city council would not be functioning. It added that the mayor and employees of the city council were given the chance to go home. Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has said his government has sent tanks to Ukraine. During an interview with private broadcaster Polsat News, Morawiecki was asked if Poland has sent, or will send, tanks to Ukraine. He replied ""yes"", without giving further details. He said he would announce more information âin due courseâ but for the time being he wouldn't reveal how many tanks have been supplied for security reasons. For several weeks now, itâs been rumoured that Poland has been supplying Ukraine with Soviet-era T-72 tanks. The Ministry of Defence had refused to comment on the rumours. Morawiecki said that the matter of Poland supplying Ukraine with Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets is now âclosedâ. In March, Poland said it was ready to deploy the jets to the US Ramstein Air Base in Germany and put them at the disposal of the US military, but Washington rejected the offer. âThere is no such necessity, there are no such demands, no such requests,â he said, when asked if sending planes to Ukraine was still being considered. Several explosions have hit the state security ministry in the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria, the interior ministry said on its Telegram channel. The ministry said the building appeared to have been hit with rocket-propelled grenades, but it said no one was injured. It comes days after a Russian general suggested Moscow wanted totake full control of southern Ukraine, giving Russia access to the separatist region of Moldova which it supports. He said there was ""oppression of the Russian-speaking population"" in Transnistria, a claim which had also been made - without evidence - to justify the invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine's defence ministry saidthe incident was a ""planned provocation"" by Russia itself to instil ""panic and anti-Ukrainian sentiment"",external. A small Russian-speaking breakaway region, Transnistria borders Ukraine from the west. It claimed independence after the fall of the Soviet Union in a bloody conflict, but is not recognised internationally and officially remains part of Moldova. A senior Russian diplomat has said a ceasefire is not a good option at the moment, because it will give Ukrainian forces the chance to ""regroup and to stage more provocations"". Earlier today, Russia announced that it would be holding a ceasefire around the steelworks in the besieged city of Mariupol from 14:00 local time (11:00 GMT), to allow civilians to leave. But Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said no agreement had been reached and called for written security guarantees. Russia's first deputy permanent representative to the UN, Dmitry Polyanskiy, said Ukraine had claimed that there were some civilians in the Azovstal steel plant, where the last Ukrainian fighters in the city are holed up, but Ukrainian forces ""did not let them go"". He went on to say that Russia had not attacked residential areas in Odesa, Ukraine's Black Sea port city, over the weekend. On Saturday, Ukraine said that two missiles struck a military facility and two residential buildings in the city. But Polyanskiy said the residential buildings were hit by Ukraine air defences. He went on to reject the comments made by US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, who said Russia had failed to achieve its aims in the invasion. Polyanskiy said: ""I don't think we failed, frankly."" He added that Russia is conducting its ""military operation"" and it has ""its own aims"" and ""its own strategies"". Nikita, Oleksandr and Vira have been living in a succession of temporary lodgings as they wait for news of a visa A disabled teenaged refugee from Ukraine and his grandparents have been stuck in Paris for more than six weeks as they wait for their UK visa application to be processed. Kateryna Karpenko persuaded her nephew Nikita Shepel, and her parents Oleksandr and Vira, to flee Russian shelling and apply to come to join her in the UK, where she has lived for almost 10 years. But amid complaints that the UK Home Office has conducted a chaotic and overly-bureaucratic response to the Ukrainian refugee crisis, the estimated five working day wait for a visa has turned into more than a month in limbo, costing them thousands of pounds in accommodation. ""They had to go through a lot, fleeing Ukraine, and they have no idea what's happening with our home, our family, our lives,"" says Kateryna. A UK government spokesman said changes the Home Office has made to the system, including simpler forms and increase staff numbers, are working. Read more  US President Joe Biden has named the veteran diplomat Bridget Brink as the new US ambassador to Ukraine. Earlier today, the White House announced that Brink would be moving to fill ""a crucial position"", which has been vacant for the past three years. Washington said Brink's appointment came at a time when the US was ramping up its support for Ukraine, amid Russia's invasion. The new ambassador is currently serving as the US ambassador to Slovakia and has been a diplomat for 25 years. The White House added that Brink's ""decades of
experience make her uniquely suited for this moment in Ukraineâs
history"". A firefighter surveys the damage at an electricity substation powering the railway near Lviv We've been bringing you updates on the reports of attacks on railway infrastructure in Ukraine, which Ukrainian officials say killed five people. Earlier, Ukraine said Russia was trying to disrupt supply lines for military equipment from foreign countries. Now Russia has confirmed that was the purpose of the attacks, according to Reuters. The news agency is citing a statement from the Russian defence ministry, saying its missiles destroyed six facilities powering the railways that were used to supply Ukrainian forces with weapons from abroad. Ukrainian officials said five railway stations in the centre and west of the country came under attack within an hour this morning. An electricity substation powering overhead lines in Krasne, near Lviv, was also hit in a missile strike. Ukraine's defence minister has thanked the US for their military assistance - describing the relationship between the two nation's as as a ""true brotherhood"". Oleksii Reznikov's comments on Twitter follow the visit to Kyiv on Sunday by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. Mr Reznikov said the support given by the Biden administration is ""not measured in money, but in the saved lives of Ukrainians"". During the visit, it was announced that US diplomats will begin returning to Ukraine and the Washington will provide Ukraine with a further $700m in military aid. Mr Reznikov also shared a video where he can be seen shaking hands and embracing Austin, accompanied by the caption: ""This is more than partnership of state officials - this is true brotherhood.""

US wants weakened Russia to avoid repeat of UkraineUS Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin says he hopes to see the Russian military depleted in Ukraine.,"Mr Austin (L) and Mr Blinken (R) became the highest level US officials to travel to Ukraine since the Russian invasion began US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin has said he hopes Russian losses in Ukraine will deter its leadership from repeating its actions elsewhere. Ukraine can still win the war if given the right support, he added. He also announced the US would allocate an extra $713m (Â£559m) of military aid to Ukraine and other European nations. Russian President Vladimir Putin has accused the West of attempting to ""split Russian society and destroy Russia from within"". Mr Austin, a retired four-star general, was speaking after meeting Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky in Kyiv. Also involving Secretary of State Antony Blinken, the visit marked the highest-level trip to Ukraine by US officials since the invasion began over two months ago. The meeting between the US and Ukrainian parties, which ran for over three hours, comes as Russia escalates its military campaign in the south and east of the country. At a news conference in Poland after the visit, Mr Austin told reporters the US wants to see ""Russia weakened to the degree that it can't do the kinds of things that it has done in invading Ukraine"". The Pentagon chief added that US officials still believed Ukraine could win the conflict with ""the right equipment"" and the ""right support"". BBC diplomatic correspondent James Landale observed that Mr Austin's comments calling for a weakened Russia were unusually strong for a US defence secretary. It is one thing to help Ukraine resist Russian aggression, it is quite another to speak of weakening Russia's capabilities, he said. Mr Putin's accusations of the West attempting to ""destroy Russia"", made during a speech on Monday, appeared to be in response to Mr Austin's comments. Mr Zelensky has called for increased military assistance from Western nations US defence officials said of the millions announced in fresh military funding, nearly $332m (Â£260m) would be allocated to Ukraine. It brings the total US security assistance provided to Ukraine since the invasion began to more than $3.7bn (Â£2.9bn). Mr Zelensky has been pleading with Western leaders to increase the flow of military equipment for weeks, vowing that his forces can overcome Russia's military if provided with fighter jets and other vehicles. Last week the US confirmed it had supplied Ukrainian troops with howitzer artillery cannons and anti-artillery radars for the first time. Russia's ambassador in Washington said Moscow had sent a diplomatic note demanding an end to the US supply of weapons to Ukraine. Mr Blinken announced some US diplomatic staff would start to return to Ukraine from next week. They are expected to be based in Lviv initially, with a longer-term plan to re-open the US Embassy in the capital, Kyiv. Russia is believed to have suffered heavy military losses President Joe Biden intends to nominate Bridget Brink, a career diplomat, as US ambassador to Ukraine - a post that has remained vacant for more than two years. Mr Blinken also defended America's diplomatic approach, telling reporters that the Western alliance the Biden administration had assembled had put pressure on President Putin's government. ""The strategy that we've put in place, massive support for Ukraine, massive pressure against Russia, solidarity with more than 30 countries engaged in these efforts, is having real results,"" Mr Blinken said. ""And we're seeing that when it comes to Russia's war aims, Russia is failing, Ukraine is succeeding."" ""A sovereign, independent Ukraine will be around a lot longer than Vladimir Putin's on the scene,"" Mr Blinken added. Speaking following the meeting, Mr Zelensky said his government appreciated ""the unprecedented assistance"" from Washington and added that he ""would like to thank President Biden personally and on behalf of the entire Ukrainian people for his leadership in supporting Ukraine"". President Biden's always made clear that the US won't directly intervene in the war in Ukraine. He won't be sending American troops to join the battle. But the truth is that the US is getting more deeply involved - and that's been highlighted by the words of the US defence secretary. America has dramatically increased the supply of weapons to Ukraine in recent weeks. Despite Russian warnings, it's made clear it'll be sending more. Mr Austin's words underline that America is not a bystander in this war. America wants to see Russia defeated. More than that, it wants to see Russia's military machine reduced to such an extent that it will not be able to threaten any another European ally in the future. The fear, shared by Nato allies, is that any kind of defeat for Ukraine will only embolden President Putin's ambitions. Mr Austin has now set out clearly that the US has its own strategic goals for this war - even if it's theoretically not participating. The goal is to stop President Putin and to weaken Russia's military to such an extent that it will no longer be able to threaten other nations. To some extent that's already happened. Military experts already believe it will take years for Russia to recover from its military losses. That might also send a signal to another nation which the US is increasingly concerned about - namely China. For President Putin it's more evidence that he's not just in a war with Ukraine. No doubt it will feed his own narrative for the purposes of domestic support. He's long portrayed Nato as a threat to Russia. In recent days Russia has refocussed its advance on Ukraine's eastern Donbas region and US sources believe that Moscow has committed over 76 battalion tactical groups inside Ukraine. On Monday, the UK's ministry of defence said in an update that Moscow had made minor advances in the region but had ""yet to achieve a breakthrough"" because of logistical issues. The update said: ""Ukraine's defence of Mariupol has also exhausted many Russian units and reduced their combat effectiveness."" Have you been affected by what is happening in Ukraine?

Twitter shares rise as reports say Musk deal close,"Trading in Twitter's shares have been halted amid reports the firm could agree a takeover deal with Elon Musk as early as Monday. The board of the social media giant is reported to have met with Mr Musk over the weekend to discuss his $43bn offer. Twitter had initially rebuffed the billionaire's approach. Butaccording to reports,external, Twitter is now in the final stages of negotiations with Mr Musk to buy the business. Reuters, the news agency, reported that an announcement may come later on Monday after Twitter's board met and recommended a deal to its shareholders. In trading earlier on Monday, shares rose more than 5%, approaching Mr Musk's offer price of $54.20 a share. Mr Musk's targeting of Twitter has moved at remarkable speed. It emerged at the beginning of April that Mr Musk, who is the boss of electric carmaker Tesla, had become the largest shareholder in Twitter with a 9.2% stake. He was then invited to join Twitter's board but turned down the offer before launching a surprise bid for the company on 14 April, saying he wantedto ""unlock"" the social media platform's ""extraordinary potential"". Twitter responded by putting in place a so-called ""poison pill"" defence to fend off Mr Musk. The mechanism would have created difficulties for Mr Musk if he attempted to increase his stake in the company. The board now appears to have U-turned after Mr Musk revealed he had lined up a $46.5bn financing package for his offer - with funding from a mixture of his own assets and the backing of Wall Street banking giant Morgan Stanley and other firms. Mr Musk recently said that he believes that Twitter should be more open and transparent. ""I think it's very important for there to be an inclusive arena for free speech,"" he told the TED2022 conference in Vancouver. The billionaire, who is the world's richest man according to Forbes magazine, has also hinted at his plans for Twitter. He asked his 83.3 million followers on Twitter if the social media platform should allow people to edit their posts - 74% of those who responded wanted an edit button. Mr Musk's has also criticised Twitter's process of verifying a Twitter account which he said was like ""if Kafka had a Magic 8-Ball!"". Even Twitter itself didn't appear to take Elon Musk seriously when he first said that he wanted to buy it. It's just Musk being, well, Musk, everyone thought. He may be the world's richest man but he is also by his own admission cash-poor - and he is well-versed in posting unsubstantiated grand ideas on social media. But underestimate him at your peril. He is a multi-billionaire and Twitter is one of his favourite toys - so he's come back with a funded $43bn offer that the firm's shareholders are now looking likely to accept. Twitter hasn't explicitly explained why it didn't initially want to become part of Mr Musk's empire. Certainly any social media firm with regulators breathing down their necks is going to be wary of a new owner who wants to ""open up"" the platform to more freedom of speech and less moderation. He's also keen on subscription rather than advertising as a business model, which may prove a hard sell for a platform that has not experienced significant user growth in ages. A Musk-owned Twitter would have a very different feel, for sure. But he also brings to it his own brand of magic -criticise him on social media and you'll soon bear the brunt of devoted fans who idolise him.

It is not clear who would run Twitter if Mr Musk's bid succeeds. He is the chief executive as well as the ""Technoking"" of Tesla according to the company's website. He is also chief executive, chief technology officer and chairman of rocket and spacecraft firm SpaceX. Mr Musk is also involved in a number of other businesses and start-ups. Twitter is led by chief executive Parag Agrawal, who took on the role last November with the backing of co-founder and former boss Jack Dorsey. At the time, Mr Dorsey said: ""My trust in Parag as Twitter's chief executive is deep. I'm deeply grateful for his skill, heart, and soul. It's his time to lead."" Mr Musk has been critical of Twitter's management. In his offer document, he told Twitter's chairman Bret Taylor: ""I don't have confidence in management.""

Pubs can stay open later for Platinum JubileeVenues in England and Wales are set to stay open until 01:00 to celebrate the Queen's 70-year reign.,"Venues can stay open until 01:00 over the extended four-day bank holiday weekend in June to mark the Queen's 70-year reign Pubs, bars and nightclubs in England and Wales can stay open later to mark the Queen's Platinum Jubilee. Opening hours will be extended by two hours to 01:00 BST over the extended bank holiday weekend between 2 and 4 June, under new government plans. Home Secretary Priti Patel said it will allow people to ""raise a glass to toast Her Majesty's incredible service"". The temporary extension to licensing regulations will not apply to supermarkets or off-licences. The Queen became the first British monarch to celebrate a Platinum Jubilee, when in February she marked 70 years since ascending to the throne, An extended four-day bank holiday weekend between 2 and 5 June to celebrate her reign will feature a variety of celebrations, including street parties and astar-studded concert outside Buckingham Palace. Parliament is set to approve an order on Monday to allow people to continue their celebrations of the historic milestone, the government said. Queen celebrates 96th birthday in Sandringham The mystery of the house where the Queen was born What makes the Queen laugh? The Queen's life in pictures Announcing the licensing plans, Priti Patel said the Queen has served the UK with the ""utmost dignity, steadfastness and resolve"" for over 70 years. Licensing laws can be relaxed by the home secretary for occasions of ""exceptional national significance"",  the Home Office explained. Ms Patel said: ""The Platinum Jubilee is a truly historic national occasion, which will see families, friends and communities across the country come together to celebrate this unprecedented landmark in a remarkable reign. ""Over the extended bank holiday weekend, we will be able to raise a glass to toast Her Majesty's incredible service to our country, while also providing a boost to the hospitality industry after a challenging couple of years."" The order will not extend to businesses which sell alcohol for consumption off the premises, such as off-licences and supermarkets, the government has decided following public consultation of the plans. The move was supported by the National Police Chiefs' Council and National Association of Licensing and Enforcement Officers. The Queen recently celebrated her 96th birthday privately in Sandringham, but recent mobility issues have prevented her from attending a variety of public ceremonies over the last few months -including church services over Easter. Her only public appearance this year, outside of her own residences or on video, was at the recent Thanksgiving Service for Prince Philip at Westminster Abbey. A number of commemorative items are being produced to mark the Jubilee. Among them is aBarbie doll, featuring a recreation of her wedding tiara and an ivory gown fitted with a blue ribbon. Plans for a 70ft (21m) sculpture containing 350 native British trees to beerected outside Buckingham Palace have also been announced.

"PM promises new Wylfa nuclear power stationBoris Johnson says new nuclear power station on Isle of Anglesey is ""going to happen"".Wales politics","Previous plans for a new nuclear power plant at Wylfa collapsed due to a lack of UK government funding The prime minister has vowed that a new nuclear power station will be built at Wylfa on Anglesey. Boris Johnson made the promise on a council election campaign visit in north Wales on Monday. The UK government has been talks with two US firms interested in a scheme at the site - no agreement has yet been reached. Mr Johnson said he wanted it to ""get it going as fast as possible"". But Labour's Shadow Welsh Secretary said it was a ""U-turn"" by the Conservatives and doubted whether the proposals would come to fruition. A previous plan for a new nuclear power station at Wylfacollapsed in 2020. Minister visits US for Wylfa nuclear deal Wylfa nuclear station 'would transform economy' Mr Johnson said: ""We need to get the right type and we need to make sure that we go ahead with the right model. ""We want to make sure we get the right deal for the UK taxpayer. ""But we also want to have something that's really ambitious, and that is going to do justice to the scale of that Wylfa site."" He said there could be a ""couple of reactors"" put at the site. ""We're now working on all this very, very fast. We want to get going on Wylfa in the next couple of years. ""It's going to happen"", he added. Boris Johnson visited Rhyl on Monday There would still be a considerable way to go before any deal is struck to build a new nuclear power station. Any company interested would need to raise a substantial amount of private sector investment as well as receive significant support from the state. On the visit Mr Johnson said he was not concerned that party-gate or a row over claims about Angela Rayner would affect the Tories council election campaign. ""This is an election about what candidates which candidates are going to deliver you value for money,"" he said. ""It's conservative councillors who deliver better value for money, better taxpayer value."" Labour Shadow Welsh Secretary Jo Stevens said Boris Johnson's comments that a power station will happen at Wylfa was ""another U-turn in a series of U-turns"". Ms Stevens said: ""I really hope that he does fulfil his promise and it is true. ""But with this prime minister, you just don't know."" ""We need an energy mix to deal with the current energy crisis,"" she said. ""So this is good news. But we could have done with it before now."" A Welsh Liberal Democrat spokesperson said: ""The Welsh Liberal Democrats have said while we recognise the investment and jobs new nuclear can bring the region it is important to note that this will do nothing in the short term to address the energy crisis and the impact it is having on people's bank accounts across Wales. ""We also believe that any development of the Wylfa site must be done with community consent and those that live near the plant should receive discounts on their electricity bills."" Anthony Slaughter, leader of the Wales Green Party, said: ""A new nuclear power station at Wylfa is nothing but an expensive distraction and in no way an answer to the energy crisis and the climate emergency. ""We need to be reachingÂ net zero as a matter of urgency, even by the most optimistic timetable newÂ nuclear would would take a decade to be up and running.""

Macron defeats Le Pen and vows to unite France,"This video can not be played France election: Macron pledges to unite France Emmanuel Macron has won five more years as France's president after a convincing victory over rival Marine Le Pen, who nevertheless secured the far right's highest share of the vote yet. He won by 58.55% to 41.45%, a greater margin than expected. The centrist leader told jubilant supporters at the foot of the Eiffel Tower that now the election was over he would be a ""president for all"". He is the first sitting president in 20 years to be re-elected. Despite her loss, Ms Le Pen, 53, said her significant vote share still marked a victory. France divided, EU delighted over Macron win Le Pen concedes but still counts a win The ideas her National Rally represented had reached new heights, she told her supporters. But far-right rival Eric Zemmour pointed out that she had ultimately failed, just like her father who preceded her: ""It's the eighth time the Le Pen name has been hit by defeat."" Marine Le Pen took over the party founded by her father Jean-Marie Le Pen in 2011 in a bid to make it electable. She won more than 13 million votes on Sunday, on a platform of tax cuts to tackle the high cost of living, a ban on wearing the Muslim headscarf in public and a referendum on immigration controls. ""An answer must be found to the anger and disagreements that led many of our compatriots to vote for the extreme right,"" Mr Macron said in his victory speech. ""It will be my responsibility and that of those around me."" More than one in three voters did not vote for either candidate.Turnout was just under 72%,external, the lowest in a presidential run-off since 1969, and more than three million people cast spoilt or blank votes. Much of France was on holiday on the day of the vote, but the low turnout also reflected the apathy of voters who complained neither candidate represented them. Voters who said they were casting blank ballots told the BBC they wanted to punish the sitting president. Anti-Macron demonstrators rallied in a number of cities, including Paris, Rennes, Toulouse and Nantes, refusing to accept the result. In his speech Mr Macron, 44, said his government would have to ""answer their choice to refuse to choose"". Far-left leader Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon, who was narrowly beaten by Ms Le Pen in the first round of voting two weeks before, was scathing about both candidates. While it was good news France had refused to place its trust in Marine Le Pen, he claimed that Mr Macron had been elected with a worse result than any other president. ""He floats in an ocean of abstentions, and blank and spoiled ballots."" ANALYSIS:Historic win but Macron has polarised France Mr Macron's victory was welcomed by relieved European leaders, who had feared a far-right candidate offering a series of anti-EU policies. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was first to congratulate him, singling out their mutual challenge in responding to Russia's war on Ukraine. US President Joe Biden also said he looked forward to ""close co-operation"" including on supporting Ukraine. This video can not be played Marine Le Pen: ""I will never abandon French people"" While Mr Macron has played a key diplomatic role in the war, Marine Le Pen has struggled to shake off accusations of ties to the Kremlin. Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky congratulated him as a ""true friend"" and said he looked forward to a strong and united Europe. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson also welcomed his victory.

Mr Macron chose a highly symbolic venue from the French Revolution for his victory speech in the Champs de Mars. Accompanied by his wife Brigitte and leading a group of children, he walked to the stage accompanied by the EU anthem Ode to Joy before promising supporters that ""no-one will be left by the wayside"". Addressing voters who had backed him to keep the far right out of power he said he would be indebted to them for years to come. The cost of living crisis facing millions of French people became the number one issue of the election campaign, and the president's opponents accused him of arrogance and acting as a president of the rich. However, Prime Minister Jean Castex told French radio that the president's re-election sent a strong message, when France was going through a considerable crisis involving ""many divisions and a lack of understanding"". Mr Castex is now likely to be replaced in the next few days, and Mr Macron may ask Labour Minister Elisabeth Borne to take over. She refused to say whether she had been lined up to be the next prime minister, insisting that the focus had to be on dealing with people's worries about living standards. But a ministerial colleague, ClÃ©ment Beaune, said the president was definitely keen on having a female prime minister. For France's political leaders, the next task is to regroup and fight parliamentary elections in June. Mr Macron may have a majority for the moment, but defeated candidates from the first round already have the new campaign in sight and one opinion poll suggests 63% of voters want him to lose his majority. If that happened, he would be forced into a ""cohabitation"" with a government led by other parties. Mr MÃ©lenchon has already held out the prospect of defeating the president's centrist party and becoming prime minister. In her speech on Sunday night, Ms Le Pen told supporters that the ""match is not completely over"" and the risks of Mr Macron holding on to complete power were high. For now there is no talk of a change of leadership in her National Rally party. ""Everything will be rebuilt around her, she's at the head of this popular and social bloc,"" spokeswoman Laure Lavalette told French TV.

Record court waits for sexual offence victims,"Serious sexual offences are taking the longest time on record to go through Crown Courts in England and Wales. Exclusive data compiled by the BBC found such cases averaged nine months to complete in 2021, with differences depending on where you live. Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said delays were caused by the pandemic but barristers blame funding cuts. Some victims have said they would consider not reporting such crimes due to their experiences of delays. Lisa, not her real name, was raped by someone she knew in 2017, but it took until late summer 2021 for her attacker to be convicted and jailed. ""I don't even have the words to explain how awful it has been,"" she said. Despite seeing justice, she said she had been left with no confidence in the system. ""God forbid it ever happened again, or to any of my family, but I wouldn't promote going through the system and even reporting a crime of this nature anymore."" The data from July to September 2021 reveals: The average case length for sexual offences was 266 days, or about nine months The longest period for sexual offence cases was in Leicester, which took 453 days (about 15 months) on average to go through the Crown Court Plymouth had the shortest wait for sexual offence cases to be completed, with an average of 76 days (about two and a half months) - meaning there is over a year's difference between the two courts The case length is considered to be the time from the first Crown Court hearing to the sentencing or end of a case. Separate national figures suggest the average case length for serious sexual offences has since risen to 270 days for October to December 2021. In the same time period, case lengths for robbery offences averaged 225 days (about seven months), while violence against the person was 206 days (about 6.5 months). Due to their nature, sexual offence cases increasingly involve large amounts of evidence gathered from mobile phones and social media - which can make things difficult for police, prosecutors and victims. Lisa went to the police with compelling evidence of what happened to her and felt confident her attacker would soon be in court. ""But it didn't happen in that way,"" she said. The Crown Prosecution Service eventually authorised the police to charge the suspect in the summer of 2019 - two years later. But because of backlogs, the earliest trial date available was April 2020. The closure of courts by the Covid pandemic meant the case was put back again until 2021. The attacker was not convicted and jailed until late summer 2021. ""I think if I hadn't reported it, I would have brought my mental health round a lot quicker than by extending the ordeal by having the additional impacts of the court system,"" Lisa said. A woman, who was a victim of a serious sexual assault when she was 15, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme her case had taken almost four years to conclude when her attacker pleaded guilty late last year. ""If I could take back reporting it to save myself the trauma that I was put through then I would in a heartbeat,"" she said. But the woman, now 19, added that to protect others from her assailant she would ""go through the whole thing again"". She said that when she found out her court hearing had been postponed from October 2020 to November 2021, due to the defendant living with someone who had Covid, it was like her body had ""just shut down"". ""It had already been two-and-a-half years and it was just about to be over and then it was taken away from under my feet."" Data about the Crown Courts - published here after BBC Freedom of Information requests - comes amid growing concerns about backlogs across courts andindustrial actionby barristers. Why do so few rape cases go to court? Campaigners say the problems could result in victims dropping their cases. Over the past four years, rape prosecutions in England and Wales have fallen by 70%. The latest available data shows the Crown Court backlog last December was 58,818 - down from a record of 61,000 cases earlier in 2021. The overall average time it now takes for all types of cases to go from a report to the police to completion in court is 697 days, just below the record of 708 days set last summer. This online tool reveals the average delays being seen court-by-court for serious sexual offences. Your device may not support this visualisation Inner London Crown Court and Harrow ranked highest in terms of having consistently long case lengths since the pandemic began, as opposed to just the latest quarter. Outside of London, St Albans, Bournemouth and Bradford saw longer cases than other areas most often. Criminal barristers say the current delays are the result of budget cuts, a decision to reduce how many days judges could sit and criminal barristers leaving for other branches of law. Figures from last week reveal the number of criminal barristers has fallen by 10% in the last year alone. ""We simply do not have sufficient numbers of judges, prosecutors, and defenders to deal with the backlog,"" said Jo Sidhu QC, chair of the Criminal Bar Association (CBA). The CBA says people are leaving for other branches of law because they can no longer make a living from cases that have to be funded through legal aid - the system that ensures that every defendant has professional representation to guarantee a fair trial. On Monday, the CBA's members began industrial action over the legal aid rates, saying the government is dragging its feet over implementing an independent review's recommendation for a 15% increase in funding. Thousands of barristers take action over legal aid Who gets legal aid? Mr Raab has warned barristers that their action will not solve the criminal justice delays they complain about - and that he will implement the increase in legal aid, and other reforms, following a legally-required consultation. The government has committed to keep operating some temporary courts that it set up to help manage the backlogs caused by the pandemic - and it has a commitment from the Treasury to fund unlimited sitting days of available judges for the next financial year. It has also introduced a system to allow more sexual offence victims to give their evidence in advance by video and is planning to move the sentencing of some lesser cases into magistrates' courts to ease the burden on judges. ""I know that it's very difficult for anyone that's been a victim of rape or serious sexual violence,"" Mr Raab said. ""You recover from the original crime - and then you've got to muster the courage to go through the [courts] process. I'm absolutely committed to making sure those victims have the support at every step of the way."" Sophia Chandler waited five years for a thief to face justice Opposition parties say the plan isn't good enough. ""This soft-on-crime Conservative Government cannot blame Covid for its ineptitude because case delays were growing long before the pandemic,"" said Steve Reed MP, Labour's shadow justice secretary. ""These findings are yet more evidence that the Conservatives are letting criminals off and letting victims down."" But despite long delays across all crimes, some victims still say they are willing to go through the court system. Sophia Chandler, who is blind, waited five years for a thief to face justice. She told police in Northamptonshire in 2017 that an assistant had been stealing from her home. The case was originally slated for trial in September 2020 - but it was then put off, relisted for September 2021 and then put off until January this year. When the opening day of the trial came, the defendant had disappeared, but she was convicted in her absence, eventually tracked down, and given an 18-week jail sentence, suspended for 18 months. Mrs Chandler said that she had been afraid to walk out in case the defendant approached her but she was now relieved the case was over. ""It took a long, long, long time,"" she says. ""I know that if it were to happen again, I would still go to the police and persevere. Otherwise there will be no justice.""

P&O Ferries hits back at staff pay cut claim,"The Spirit of Britain resumed cross channel services this weekend P&O Ferries has hit back at claims that it tried to get its new cheaper agency staff to accept even lower wages. The RMT Union said it received reports of new workers at Dover being asked to sign new contracts, replacing ones they had signed weeks ago, on lower pay. It reported P&O Ferries to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, which ensured the new workers retained their wages. But P&O Ferries told the BBC ""no agency seafarers were asked to accept reduced wages"". The company, which has come under fire for sacking 800 workers without notice and replacing them with cheaper agency staff in March, said there were ""no plans to change or reduce the wages"" of the new seafarers. Its statement on Monday came after the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) claimed a seafarer on the Spirit of Britain ferry at Dover, hired as a replacement for the sacked staff last month, contacted the union begging for help in a dispute over pay. The union said the company was now ""trying to bring in an exploitative model, with the lowest possible standards they can get away with"". In an email seen by the BBC the worker wrote: ""They don't care about our rights. They try to give us less money. We are desperate."" The seafarer told the union they were being forced to work without contracts, after old ones had expired. The worker claimed documents had also been lost by P&O Ferries. ""This is my sixth day working without a contract, please help us!,"" they said. The RMT union complained to the Maritime and Coastguard Authority (MCA) about the new move by P&O Ferries who ensured seafarers' contracts were amended with their original wages reinstated. The MCA confirmed it had investigated the complaint and ""as a result the affected seafarers were issued with amended contracts, which reverted to their original wages"". However, P&O Ferries said there had been an ""administrative misunderstanding"" around a contract presented to one individual who appeared to have been ""unaware of an appendix which made clear that he would be entitled to an additional Â£195 a month, meaning that there was no change in his overall pay"". A spokesman said the company had contacted the MCA ""to request that they withdraw their statement, which is misleading"". The MCA said the complaint from the seafarer had been upheld. ""We will continue to comply fully with any national minimum wage obligations introduced by the UK government,"" P&O added. P&O has previously declined to comment on how much agencies pay workers on ferries. Some of P&O's ferries are registered in Cyprus, meaning they do not have to pay the minimum wage required by UK law, which rose to Â£9.50 an hour from 1 April. 17 March: P&O Ferries sacks 800 staff and begins replacing them with cheaper agency workers. 24 March: P&O Ferries boss Peter Hebblethwaite admits to MPs that the decision to sack 800 workers without notice broke the law and says he would make the same decision again if he had to. 28 March: Transport Secretary Grant Shapps urges P&O to re-employ sacked workers and says the government plans to make it illegal for ferry firms to pay less than the minimum wage. On Friday, the Spirit of Britain, which operates between Dover and Calais,was cleared to resume sailingafter inspections by the MCA. It had been held at the port since 12 April due to a number of unspecified deficiencies, according to the regulator. It is expected P&O Ferries' freight sailings from Dover will resume this week, while passenger services are expected to resume early next week. RMT officials went aboard the Spirit of Britain to speak with new seafarers on Friday, who it said shared complaints over contracts. National secretary Darren Proctor, who was on the visit, claimed P&O Ferries had ""brought people in on a month contract, some on two-month contracts"" and then told them that they have to accept lower pay rates if they want to stay on. ""P&O is undermining safety and creating a lowest possible denominator in ferry standards,"" he said. This video can not be played P&O Ferries boss Peter Hebblethwaite faces MPs When P&O Ferries sacked its staff in March, the company said the move was to ensure the future of the business. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps has said he wants to see British ports refusing access to ferry companies ""who don't pay a fair wage"". He has said the government will consult on changes needed to make it a legal requirement, but urged ports to take action ""as soon as practical"". However, British ports have described the new pay plans for the ferry industry as ""unworkable"".

"Girls appear in 99% of child sex abuse imagesThe Internet Watch Foundation says it found illegal content on 252,000 web pages last year.Cambridgeshire","This video can not be played Tackling online child abuse is 'a kind of warfare' Investigators warn that 99% of child sexual abuse imagery found features girls - up from 65% a decade ago. The Internet Watch Foundation (IWF) finds, flags, and removes images and videos of child sexual abuse from the web. Last year the Cambridge-based charity's analysts uncovered illegal content on 252,000 web pages, the highest number since it began. The charity's annual report said 70% of victims were aged between 11 and 13. Where boys were included in the material, it tended to be of a more severe category, the IWF said. The material was found to be predominantly self-generated and usually recorded at home using a phone or webcam. Emma Hardy said parents needed to talk to children to help keep them safe Emma Hardy, from the charity's senior leadership team, said: ""Since the pandemic there has been a near four-fold increase in the amount of content where offenders are accessing children remotely. ""That often happens when children are in bedrooms alone and have an internet-enabled device with a camera built in."" The charity said the increase could be due to older children exploring new technologies and spending more time online. ""Parents need to talk as a family because we know that's the best way to keep children safe,"" Ms Hardy said. The IWF works to make the internet a safer place by identifying and removing global online child sexual abuse imagery The National Crime Agency (NCA) estimates as many as 850,000 people in the UK pose a sexual threat to children. A spokesperson for the NCA said offenders were increasingly turning to social media platforms to abuse children, using manipulation, threats and ""sextortion"", in which victims are sexually coerced remotely. The Online Safety Bill, which received its second reading last week, aims to tackle the spread of child sexual abuse material by regulating some internet services. But the IWF and other charities have expressed concerns the legislation will not go far enough. Andy Burrows from the NSPCC said the bill ""must be strengthened to give Ofcom the powers to proactively tackle abuse in private messaging"". ""It should also prevent offenders from using social networks to signpost to child abuse content on third party sites,"" he said. Home Secretary Priti Patel said she was ""determined"" to ""ensure that perpetrators are brought to justice"". ""This report from the Internet Watch Foundation will help our law enforcement agencies understand the changing nature of online child abuse as the lines are increasingly blurred between children's physical and digital lives,"" she said. ""The government's Online Safety Bill will ensure that technology companies are held accountable for keeping children safe online and we will impose a powerful range of sanctions if they fail to do so.""

"Zara threatens legal action over boutique nameThe high street fashion giant claims Darlington-based House of Zana is ""conceptually identical"".Tees","Amber Kotrri refuses to rename her business and insists there is no risk of confusion An independent fashion boutique is due to face high street clothing company Zara at a tribunal over claims it is an ""identical brand"". Darlington-based House of Zana has been threatened with legal action by the Spanish fashion giant which claims the brand is ""conceptually identical"". Lawyers want Amber Kotrri, who opened her store in 2019 after trading online, to change its name and branding. Mrs Kotrri said doing that would be ""the last thing we want to do"". She received a notice of opposition from Zara when she tried to trademark the name House of Zana, followed by a letter from the multi-national company's lawyers that argued the County Durham business was ""confusingly similar"" for customers. The letter went on to say the name House of Zana ""dilutes the distinctiveness and reputation of the Zara brand"". Mrs Kotrri was asked to rename her business and remove all existing branding, but she refused. She said there was ""no risk of confusing us with Zara"" and the change would ""cause irreparable damage"" to her business. Amber Kotrri says her business is named after the Albanian word for fairy Mrs Kotrri started the business while living with her husband in Albania. She said: ""Our name is very meaningful and personal to us and poses no commercial threat to Zara, and their massive market. ""We don't believe anyone has or will confuse House of Zana with Zara. We're a small business that specialises in handmade kimonos. We have one small concept store in the North East of England and a website to help promote our products."" The final hearing to decide whether she can keep the name House of Zana is due to take place next month. Zara's owner Inditex said it had opposed Mrs Kotrri's trademark application ""because of its similarity to Zara's brand name"". A spokesperson said: ""We wish the business every success and we continue to make efforts to reach the business directly so we can resolve the situation amicably.""

Beijing kicks off mass testing after Covid spike,"All 3.5 million residents in the city's largest Chaoyang district will undergo three rounds of mass testing, The Chinese capital Beijing has kicked off mass testing for millions of residents after a spike in Covid cases. The Chaoyang district reported 26 cases over the weekend - the highest number so far in Beijing's latest surge. Long queues outside supermarkets and shops were seen despite government assurances there is sufficient food. It comes amid fears that Beijing could face a similar situation to Shanghai, which has seen some 25 million people shut in their homes for weeks. All 3.5 million residents in Chaoyang, Beijing's most populous district, will undergo three rounds of mass testing, according to a notice by the city's disease prevention team. People in Chaoyang queueing up to get tested The news prompted residents to rush to stock up essential supplies, with images circulating on local media showing supermarket shelves emptied of goods and snaking queues at check-out counters. Beijing's major supermarkets also extended their opening hours to accommodate the spike in demand. Long queues at a supermarket in Beijing ""Never thought I would go to the market early in the morningâ¦.when I got there, all the eggs and prawns were gone and all the meat was snatched up,"" said one Weibo user in Shanghai, before adding they managed to get some vegetables. Another Weibo user in Shanghai said: ""Seeing people in Beijing rush to buy food is both funny and distressingâ¦ it's like looking at what my own life was like just last month."" State-media news outlet The Global Times said that Beijing's fresh food companies have been ordered to increase the supply of groceries like meat, poultry eggs and vegetables. They also quoted health experts as saying that the results of the mass testing would indicate whether there is a need to escalate measures further, such as locking down several areas. Separately, Pang Xinghuo, deputy director of the Beijing Center for Disease Prevention and Control, told state-media outlet China Daily that the number of cases in Beijing is expected to increase in the following days. Censors try to block viral Shanghai lockdown video Shanghai escalates Covid lockdown restrictions The latest outbreak in Shanghai, first detected in late March, has seen more than 400,000 cases recorded so far and 138 deaths. Some of the measures Chinese authorities have enforced includeplacing electronic door alarmsto prevent those infected from leaving and forcibly evacuating people from their homes to carry out disinfection procedures. Some in locked-down areas of Shanghai say they have been struggling to access food supplies, and forced to wait for government drop-offs of vegetables, meat and eggs. Green barricades have also been erectedovernight in parts of Shanghai without prior warning, effectively preventing residents from leaving their homes. In contrast to many other countries, China is pursuing a zero-Covid strategy with the aim of eradicating the virus from the country completely. While officials managed to keep infection levels relatively low at the beginning of the pandemic, later lockdowns have struggled to contain recent, more transmissible variants of the virus. Outside Shanghai and Beijing, more than 20 cities, home to more than 30 million people, are under lockdown In some cities, such as Sanya in the south, people can only enter or leave with a negative Covid test less than 48 hours old, along with a green code on China's covid app Jiangsu province, where more than 80 million people live, closed 129 highway toll stations and 59 service centres for a period earlier this month The Ministry of Transport says 11 highway toll stations and 27 service centres remain closed across the country (down from 677 stations and 337 centres on 10 April) This video can not be played Residents of Beicai on the city outskirts were bussed out during the night How have you been affected by the issues relating to coronavirus?

Supermarkets cut prices as they fight for customers,"Morrisons and Asda are cutting prices as supermarkets face a fierce battle for customers with the soaring cost of living hitting households' finances. Both supermarkets have been losing customers to discounters such as Aldi and Lidl as price pressures grow. Morrisons said it would offer an average 13% price cut on more than 500 goods including eggs, beef and rice. Meanwhile, Asda announced it had ""dropped and locked in"" prices on some products until the end of the year. The cost of living is rising at its fastest rate in 30 years in part due to soaring food prices. Morrisons, which is the UK's fourth-largest supermarket after Tesco, Sainsbury's and Asda, said the cuts would cover refrigerated, frozen and store cupboard food and affect around 6% of its total sales volume. ""We know that our customers are under real financial pressure at the moment and we want to play our part in helping them when it comes to the cost of grocery shopping,"" said boss David Potts. Items being discounted include cereal, cooking sauces, chicken and sausages as well as flour, bread and ham. Waitrose in row with Asda over budget range name Food boss says prices could rise by up to 15% Why are prices rising so quickly? Meanwhile, Asda said more than 100 products covered by its ""dropped and locked"" promise ranged from some fresh fruit and vegetables to fresh meat and frozen food. The supermarket said prices would drop by 12% on average. ""We know that household budgets are being squeezed by an increasing cost of living and we are committed to doing everything we can to support our customers, colleagues and communities in these exceptionally tough times,"" said Mohsin Issa, co-owner of Asda. The cost of living squeeze is starting to bite and shoppers are on the hunt for value in the supermarket aisles. Recent industry data shows more people are ditching the big brands in favour of own-label products to save money. They've also been turning to the discounters, Aldi and Lidl. After a tough pandemic, they've been growing market share. Tesco and Sainsbury's have Aldi price-matching campaigns and have been performing better than Morrisons and Asda. Now these two are fighting back. They need to. Morrisons and Asda have traditionally served budget conscious shoppers and can't afford to haemorrhage customers to the discounters. Last month, Asda launched its Just Essentials range promising an expanded line of low-cost products in all its stores from May. In February, the grocer said it would offer a wider range of low-cost goods in its stores after being criticised by food poverty campaigner and chef Jack Monroe. Last week, the UK's largest supermarket chain, Tesco, said its profits last year more than trebled, but said itsperformance this year would be affected by the need to keep prices down. Both Asda and Morrisons are losing out as customers turn to discounters Aldi and Lidl, to cut their costs, according to research firm Kantar. UK grocery price inflation hit 5.2% in the 12 weeks to 20 March, it said, its highest level since April 2012. In that time, Lidl and Aldi were the only big supermarkets to see their sales and market shares rise. By contrast, Morrisons and Asda saw the biggest drops in sales and market share. Kantar's head of retail Fraser McKevitt said: ""We're really starting to see the switch from the pandemic being the dominant factor driving our shopping behaviour towards the growing impact of inflation, as the cost of living becomes the bigger issue on consumers' minds."" In March, one food boss told the BBC food price inflation could rise as a high as 15% this year as a result of the war in Ukraine. Ronald Kers, the boss of food firm 2 Sisters, blamed the rising prices of wheat and natural gas, which is used to heat greenhouses and to make fertiliser.

Nissan signals the end of the road for Datsun cars,"The Datsun Redi-Go Car maker Nissan is to stop producing vehicles under the Datsun name, which has a more than century-long history. It was one of the brands that helped Japanese car makers become established globally after the Second World War. Despite selling millions of cars around the world, the Datsun name was phased out in the 1980s. The company revived the brand three decades later, describing the new range of vehicles as ""an important part of Nissan's DNA"". On Monday, Nissan spokesperson Azusa Momose told the BBC that the firm will continue to sell its stock of Datsun cars and provide aftersales services to their owners. ""We can reassure all existing and future Datsun owners that customer satisfaction remains our priority,"" she added. The good old days? Datsuns sold well in the UK during the 1970s but the name was phased out in the following decade Before the Datsun brand name came into being, a car named the DAT was built in 1914 by the Kaishinsha Motorcar Works in Tokyo. The word DAT was an acronym of the family names of three early investors in the business: Den, Aoyama and Takeuchi. It also literally means 'lightning fast' in Japanese. At the same time, it was promoted as Durable, Attractive and Trustworthy, or DAT for short. Nissan boss warns no end in sight to chip shortage In 1933, Nissan's founder Yoshisuke Aikawa took over the business. The early 1930s also saw the company launch an economical and lightweight car named ""DAT-son"" or ""the son of DAT"". The name was subsequently changed to ""Datsun"". The late Hollywood star Paul Newman checking his Datsun racing car Datsun was one of the brands that helped Japanese car makers establish themselves in Europe, the US and Asia after World War II. It was one of the main brands Nissan marketed globally, besides the mainstream Nissan and the luxury Infiniti. In the 1970s, the fuel-efficient Datsun was marketed as the choice of the everyday motorist looking for an alternative to unreliable gas-guzzlers. Around 20 million Datsun cars were sold in 190 countries across the world. However, the name was phased out from 1981, with Nissan becoming the company's primary brand globally. In 2012, Nissan announced the return of the Datsun brand and sold cars under the name in countries including India and Indonesia. At the time, like many rival car manufacturers, Nissan faced weak markets in Europe and the US and was targeting emerging economies with lower priced models. Despite this, sales of the models have slumped in recent years. Nissan said on Monday that it will now focus on ""core models and segments that bring the most benefit to customers, dealer partners and the business"" as part of a global transformation strategy.

Twitter board meets Musk to discuss bid - reports,"Twitter's board reportedly met Elon Musk over the weekend to explore his $43bn (Â£33.6bn) takeover offer for the social media platform. After the Tesla boss first revealed his bid, Twitter's management announced a so-called ""poison pill"" strategy to fend off a potential hostile buyout. Mr Musk plans to finance his bid with the backing of US lender Morgan Stanley and other financial institutions. A spokesperson for Twitter declined to comment on the reports. Details of how Mr Musk intended to finance his offer, which were disclosed to US regulators on Thursday, made Twitter's 11-member board seriously consider a possible deal, according to Reuters, the New York Times and Bloomberg - citing anonymous sources. Mr Musk, who owns a more than 9% stake in Twitter, has lined up a $46.5bn financing package for his bid, according to a regulatory filing. The funding will come from a mixture of his own assets and the backing of Wall Street banking giant Morgan Stanley and other firms. A number of Twitter shareholders reportedly contacted the company after Mr Musk announced the financing plan and urged it not to miss the opportunity for a potential deal. Twitter board takes action to fight Musk bid Elon Musk 'not sure' his Twitter bid will succeed Dan Ives, an analyst at investment firm Wedbush Securities, said many investors will view the discussions ""as the beginning of the end for Twitter as a public company, with Musk likely now on a path to acquire the company unless a second bidder comes into the mix"". A hostile takeover attempt by Mr Musk, who is the world's richest person, would put ""further pressure on the board with their backs against the wall in this Game of Thrones battle for Twitter,"" Mr Ives added. Earlier this month, Mr Musk refused a seat on Twitter's board, which would have limited the shares he was allowed to own. He then mademade an unsolicited offer for the companyon 14 April. The next day, Twitter's board announced a plan to protect itself against a potential hostile takeover by adopting what is known as a ""limited-duration shareholder rights plan"", also known as a ""poison pill"". The move deters anyone from having more than a 15% stake in the company. It does this by allowing others to buy additional shares in the firm at a discount. A takeover bid is considered to be hostile when a person or business tries to take over another company against the wishes of the target firm's management.

P&O Ferries forced to reverse attempt at pay cut,"P&O Ferries has been forced to reverse an attempt to pay its new, cheaper agency workers even less money. It comes after the RMT Union received reports of agency workers at Dover being asked to sign new contracts replacing their old ones on lower pay. The union reported P&O Ferries to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, which ensured the new workers retained their original wages. The company has been asked for comment but has so far not responded. P&O Ferries sacked almost 800 employees last month and brought in cheaper agency workers on some of its boats, in a move it said would ensure the future of the business. However, the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) said the firm was now ""trying to bring in an exploitative model, with the lowest possible standards they can get away with"". RMT said that a seafarer on the Spirit of Britain ferry at Dover had initially contacted the union begging for help in a dispute over pay. In an email seen by the BBC the worker wrote: ""They don't care about our rights. They try to give us less money. We are desperate."" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said it was ""good P&O have reversed [the] further attempt at a pay cut"", but added that ""they must go much further and pay the minimum wage like all UK businesses"". ""We will legislate to force them, but they could win back some much needed credibility by acting now,"" he said. The Spirit of Britain resumed cross channel services this weekend On Friday, the Spirit of Britainwas cleared to resume sailingafter inspections by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. It had been held at the port since 12 April due to a number of unspecified deficiencies, according to the regulator. It is P&O's first Dover to Calais ferry to recommence operations, with services set to resume on Tuesday morning. The seafarer who contacted the RMT told the union that they were being forced to work without contracts, after old ones had expired. The worker claimed documents had also been lost by P&O. The worker wrote in their email to the union: ""This is my sixth day working without a contract, please help us!"" On Friday, the RMT went aboard the Spirit of Britain to speak with seafarers after being previously refused access. National secretary Darren Proctor, who was on the visit, said P&O Ferries initially did not want to let them on, instead offering the use of a meeting room in the port. The RMT declined, quoting the ISPS Code, which is a comprehensive set of measures designed to strengthen the security of ships and port facilities. Once on board, the union's representatives were chaperoned to a new lounge on the ferry for pets, where the RMT inspectors were able to speak directly to newly employed workers. The RMT said it had spoken to a number of workers from around the world who have joined the ferry's crew who shared similar complaints. P&O resumes full Cairnryan - Larne service Are the P&O Ferries sackings legal? New ferry rules on pay wonât work, warn ports Mr Proctor said P&O Ferries had ""brought people in on a month contract, some on two-month contracts"" and then told them that they have to accept lower pay rates if they want to stay on. ""Others are coming in on four-month contracts on lower pay. P&O is undermining safety and creating a lowest possible denominator in ferry standards,"" he said. The union complained to the Maritime and Coastguard Authority (MCA) who took action and affected seafarers' contracts were amended with their original wages reinstated. RMT said that P&O was ""desperate to keep these new crew on board because they've been on board for four weeks now and these crews were beginning to have familiarity with the vessels. They need familiarity to get them sailing again."" Tim Morris, chief of trade association UK Major Ports Group, said P&O Ferries' newest move was ""clearly not great news for the reputation for maritime in the UK"". He told the BBC's Today programme the ports industry was ""disappointed and surprised as everyone else on what has gone on"". ""It's not how we operate in the ports sector,"" he said. ""We hire locally, we pay well, we have well established industrial relations."" Mr Morris said there was a law that stopped port operators ""picking and choosing who we let into our ports outside of some very narrow safety constraints"". ""Whilst we're as disappointed and surprised as everybody else, there needs to be a change in the law before employment conditions can be linked to port access,"" he added. This video can not be played P&O Ferries boss Peter Hebblethwaite faces MPs Last month, P&O Ferries boss Peter Hebblethwaite admitted to MPs that the decision to sack 800 workers last month without notice broke the law. He said there was ""absolutely no doubt"" that under UK employment law the firm was required to consult unions before making the mass cuts. However, he said no union would have accepted the plan and it was easier to compensate workers ""in full"" instead. The P&O boss also said he would make the same decision again if he had to. Mr Shapps has said he wanted to see British ports refusing access to ferry companies ""who don't pay a fair wage"". He said the government would consult on the changes needed to make it a legal requirement, but urged ports to take action ""as soon as practical"". However, British ports have described the new pay plans for the ferry industry as ""unworkable"". ""The ports industry is genuinely sympathetic towards the situation of the impacted seafarers, however we would suggest that ports are not the competent authorities to enforce rules on employee salaries or working conditions in the shipping industry,"" said Richard Ballantyne of the British Ports Association.

"LiveLiveRussia brutalising Ukraine but losing war, US says9 minutes ago","Russia says it has destroyed six substations powering Ukrainian railways used to transport foreign weapons Ukraine's armed forces say Russia is targeting rail junctions to hit military supply routes At least five people in central Ukraine were killed in the attacks, Ukrainian officials say About 15,000 Russian troops have been killed since Russia invaded Ukraine, UK Defence Secretary Ben Wallace says US Secretary of State Antony Blinken says Russia is trying to brutalise parts of Ukraine but failing in its war aims He was speaking after meeting President Zelensky in Kyiv on Sunday US Defence Secretary Lloyd Austin, who also went to Kyiv, said the US wanted to see Russia militarily weakened Edited by Jude Sheerin Theo LeggettBBC International Business Correspondent Global military spending exceeded $2tn (Â£1.6tn) for the first time in 2021, with Russia's increased significantly, a new report says. It was the seventh year in which the total had risen, the report by the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute said. The rise in military spending is set to continue, as European countries build up their armed forces in response to Russiaâs invasion of Ukraine. The US spent more than $800bn on its military last year, more than double that of any other country. Russia increased its military spending by nearly 3%, helped by higher oil and gas revenues, as it built up its forces on the Ukrainian border. Finland and Sweden are gearing up to announce at the same time in May that they want to join Nato, Finnish and Swedish tabloids have reported. Both countries are militarily non-aligned but Russia's invasion of Ukraine has prompted increasing public support for joining the Western defensive alliance. Finnish newspaper Iltalehti says it believes the leaders of Finland and Sweden plan to meet in the week of 16 May and then announce that they will apply to join Nato. Finnish Foreign Minister Pekka Haavisto declined to comment. The Swedish tabloid Aftonbladet, citing unnamed sources, also said it believed the two countries would make announcements that week, at the same time as each other. Russia has warned of a nuclear build-up in the Baltic should Finland and Sweden join Nato. Reality Check A MiG-29 on display at an air base in india India has been under pressure to help isolate Russia after its invasion of Ukraine. But it has long-standing defence ties to Moscow. Finance Minister Nirmala Sitharaman, visiting the US, has said that while India would like to be a âgood friendâ to Western countries, it needed to protect its interests and ensure its security. Data from the Stockholm International Peace Research Institute (Sipri), shows that India is one of the worldâs largest buyers of weapons. And since 1992, about two-thirds of its military equipment has come from Russia. It has diversified its sources of weapons in recent years, buying more equipment from other countries. But if you look at the period from 2016 to 2021, Russia continued to be by far the largest supplier of weapons to India, accounting for twice as much as the next biggest supplier, France. Alina Kabaeva is a 38-year old Olympic gold medalist White House press secretary Jen Psaki denied at Monday's daily press briefing the US was deliberately holding off on sanctioning the woman believed to be Putin's girlfriend. ""We're continuing to review sanctions,"" Psaki said when asked why Russian politician and ex-gymnast Alina Kabaeva had not yet been targeted. ""No-one is safe from our sanctions,"" Psaki continued. ""We've already of course sanctioned President Putin, but also his daughter and his closest cronies, and we will continue to review more,"" she added. Calls have been rising for the US to sanction the 38-year old Olympic gold medalist, as the US has done to Putin's two adult daughters. Putin is known for being intensely private about his personal life, and has never acknowledged any romantic relationship with Russia's ""secret first lady"", as she has been dubbed in the Russian and foreign press. According to a Wall Street Journal report, US officials have withheld sanctions on Kabaeva due to concerns that Putin would view it as a personal attack. It would be viewed as ""so personal a blow to Mr Putin that it could further escalate tensions between Russia and the US"", the Journal wrote. An railway electricity substation near Lviv was damaged in a Russian strike aimed at halting the supply of foreign weapons If you're just joining us, here's a round-up of the latest events in Ukraine.  Lavrov also acknowledged there's a possibility of the conflict escalating to nuclear weapons, though he also sounded a hopeful note about the prospects of a peace accord. Speaking to the Russian First Channel on Monday, he said Moscow wanted to avoid ""artificially"" elevated risks of such a conflict. ""This is our key position on which we base everything. The risks now are considerable,"" Lavrov said. ""I would not want to elevate those risks artificially. Many would like that. The danger is serious, real, And we must not underestimate it."" Lavrov also accused President Volodymyr Zelensky of Ukraine of ""pretending"" to negotiate, calling him ""a good actorâ. ""If you watch attentively and read attentively what he says, you'll find a thousand contradictions,"" Russiaâs top diplomat said. The foreign minister said last week that Moscow was committed to avoiding a nuclear war. On Monday, Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba tweeted that Lavrovâs latest comments were an indication Russia had lost its ""last hope to scare the world off supporting Ukraineâ. ""Thus the talk of a ârealâ danger of WWIII. This only means Moscow senses defeat in Ukraine,"" he tweeted. Days after the invasion began back on 24 February, Russian President Vladimir Putin ordered his nuclear forces to be on alert. The US and its Nato allies have said they do not want direct military intervention in Ukraine, in order to avoid the risks of a Third World War. Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov has said deliveries of Western weaponry to Ukraine mean that the Nato alliance is ""in essence engaged in war with Russiaâ. In an interview aired on Monday, he said: ""These weapons will be a legitimate target for Russiaâs military acting within the context of the special operation.â Lavrov also told state television: ""Nato, in essence, is engaged in a war with Russia through a proxy and is arming that proxy. War means war."" In his nightly video address to the nation, Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky says that Ukraine's victory is inevitable, but it is impossible to predict when the war will conclude. ""Many cities and communities are still under the temporary control of the Russian army,"" he says in his address. ""But I have no doubt that it is only a matter of time before we liberate our land."" Earlier in his address, he marked the fact that the invasion, which began on 24 February, has just surpassed the three-month mark. Zelensky goes on to say that there is ""no simple answer"" to the question of when Ukraine will defeat the Russians, adding that victory - and peace - will come more quickly if every Ukrainian fights. ""When we gain a victory, everyone will feel it. When peace comes, everyone will see it. ""But for this to happen - and happen faster - we need to think not about when and what it will be. We must think every day about how to make the stay of the occupiers on our land even more unbearable."" ""For Russia to seek peace, every Ukrainian must still fight,"" he continues. ""They must defend freedom. Because every day of struggle now adds years of peaceful life after this war. After our victory."" This ambulance was one of 20 donated earlier this month to the war-torn country The UK is donating 22 new ambulances and medical equipment to Ukraine following a request from the government there, Prime Minister Boris Johnson has announced. It comes just weeks after a shipment of 20 ambulances was sent to the country, as it battles against the Russian invasion. Medical aid charity UK-Med, which works on the front line of disasters around the world, has been given Â£300,000 of funding to train Ukrainian doctors, nurses and paramedics in dealing with mass casualties. The charity has also been given Â£300,000 of medicines and other pharmaceutical supplies to bring to Ukrainian medical staff. More than 40 fire engines have already arrived in Ukraine from the UK, after the nation saw more than 100 of its fire stations and 250 fire engines destroyed in the war. Steve RosenbergRussia editor, reporting from Bryansk Plumes of smoke were captured rising into the sky from the oil depot in Bryansk on a video on social media The city of Bryansk is a hundred miles from Russiaâs border
with Ukraine. But today it looked like it was on the front line. Plumes of
thick black smoke dominated the skyline - the consequence of fires overnight.
First one fuel depot erupting in flames, and then another. The cause? Well, thereâs been no official explanation - there
is, however, much speculation. Was this the result of a Ukrainian strike to
disrupt logistics for Russiaâs military offensive? Was it sabotage by Russian
opponents of the Kremlinâs so-called special military operation? Neither Moscow
nor Kyiv is saying. Whatever the cause, the fires have sparked concern amongst
the Russian public. Here are some of the things people told me on the streets
of Bryansk: âThis never happened before. At 3am we heard explosions.
Weâre amazed.â âI donât know what this is. Is it war here? Well, I suppose
weâre on the front line. I wonder if Ukraine did this..?â We have seen something similar in Belgorod, earlier this
month. Another blaze at another Russian fuel depot near the border. Russia
claimed Ukrainian helicopter gunships had opened fire. Kyiv wouldnât confirm
it. But one thing is clear. Despite President Putinâs claims
that he sent his troops into Ukraine to bring Russians security, there is
little sign of that. Electronic equipment which could be used to intercept communications and spy on Ukrainians is the latest category of products to be banned by the UK for export to Russia. The Department for International Trade also announced the UK would remove tariffs and quotes on products from Ukraine, responding to a request from President Volodymyr Zelensky to support the country's economy as it defends itself from invasion. The decision would affect key Ukrainian exports such as barley, honey, tinned tomatoes and poultry, the UK said. Tariffs will be lifted for 12 months initially, but could be extended. As well as equipment used to intercept and monitor communications, the UK has previously banned the export of luxury goods, aviation and space equipment, oil refining items and advanced technologies such as quantum computing. Jonathan BealeDefence correspondent, reporting from Donbas Lieutenant Denys Gordeev is used to war, but not like this. ""It's become much harder,"" he says. ""We have bomb attacks, rocket attacks every day, all the time, every hour."" Though he has spent eight years battling Russian-backed separatists in the Donbas, now he and his men are facing the full might of the Russian army. After its retreat from Kyiv three weeks ago, Russia has refocused its military efforts in Eastern Ukraine - with its goal of taking the whole of the Donbas region. It has redeployed many of its units to the east. Western officials estimate that Russia now has about 76 Battalion Tactical Groups in the region - each of which has about 800 men. They also say there's some evidence Russia's been addressing some of its early mistakes, helped by the fact they're now fighting on fewer fronts, and under a unified command. The result is that Ukrainian forces are struggling to hold a 300-mile front in the Donbas. They've already lost ground to the Russians and are likely to lose more in the days ahead. Russian forces have been conducting probing attacks to find weak points in Ukraine's defences. For now the invading army is mostly using its artillery and rockets to grind down Ukraine's defences. Some military analysts expect a major assault is still to come. And Ukrainian forces, including Lt Gordeev and his unit, appear to be holding the line, although Western experts say they are already outnumbered three to one. Read the full report here. Now some news from Kherson, the only major city that Russian forces have taken and continued to occupy. Its Ukrainian mayor, Ihor Kolykhayev, has reported on Facebook that Russian armed men took control of the city council building on Monday. Although Kherson has been under Russian occupation since early March, the city council had still been functioning under Ukrainian control. Kolykhayev said the Russian military took away the keys to the building and exchanged the security guards for guards of their own. He said he left the building at 19.45 local time. Pravda, a Ukrainian news outlet, reported that from 26 April, Kherson city council would not be functioning. It added that the mayor and employees of the city council were given the chance to go home. Adam EastonWarsaw Correspondent Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki has said his government has sent tanks to Ukraine. During an interview with private broadcaster Polsat News, Morawiecki was asked if Poland has sent, or will send, tanks to Ukraine. He replied ""yes"", without giving further details. He said he would announce more information âin due courseâ but for the time being he wouldn't reveal how many tanks have been supplied for security reasons. For several weeks now, itâs been rumoured that Poland has been supplying Ukraine with Soviet-era T-72 tanks. The Ministry of Defence had refused to comment on the rumours. Morawiecki said that the matter of Poland supplying Ukraine with Soviet-era MiG-29 fighter jets is now âclosedâ. In March, Poland said it was ready to deploy the jets to the US Ramstein Air Base in Germany and put them at the disposal of the US military, but Washington rejected the offer. âThere is no such necessity, there are no such demands, no such requests,â he said, when asked if sending planes to Ukraine was still being considered. Several explosions have hit the state security ministry in the breakaway Moldovan region of Transnistria, the interior ministry said on its Telegram channel. The ministry said the building appeared to have been hit with rocket-propelled grenades, but it said no one was injured. It comes days after a Russian general suggested Moscow wanted totake full control of southern Ukraine, giving Russia access to the separatist region of Moldova which it supports. He said there was ""oppression of the Russian-speaking population"" in Transnistria, a claim which had also been made - without evidence - to justify the invasion of Ukraine. Ukraine's defence ministry saidthe incident was a ""planned provocation"" by Russia itself to instil ""panic and anti-Ukrainian sentiment"",external. A small Russian-speaking breakaway region, Transnistria borders Ukraine from the west. It claimed independence after the fall of the Soviet Union in a bloody conflict, but is not recognised internationally and officially remains part of Moldova. A senior Russian diplomat has said a ceasefire is not a good option at the moment, because it will give Ukrainian forces the chance to ""regroup and to stage more provocations"". Earlier today, Russia announced that it would be holding a ceasefire around the steelworks in the besieged city of Mariupol from 14:00 local time (11:00 GMT), to allow civilians to leave. But Ukrainian Deputy Prime Minister Iryna Vereshchuk said no agreement had been reached and called for written security guarantees. Russia's first deputy permanent representative to the UN, Dmitry Polyanskiy, said Ukraine had claimed that there were some civilians in the Azovstal steel plant, where the last Ukrainian fighters in the city are holed up, but Ukrainian forces ""did not let them go"". He went on to say that Russia had not attacked residential areas in Odesa, Ukraine's Black Sea port city, over the weekend. On Saturday, Ukraine said that two missiles struck a military facility and two residential buildings in the city. But Polyanskiy said the residential buildings were hit by Ukraine air defences. He went on to reject the comments made by US Secretary of State Anthony Blinken, who said Russia had failed to achieve its aims in the invasion. Polyanskiy said: ""I don't think we failed, frankly."" He added that Russia is conducting its ""military operation"" and it has ""its own aims"" and ""its own strategies"". Nikita, Oleksandr and Vira have been living in a succession of temporary lodgings as they wait for news of a visa A disabled teenaged refugee from Ukraine and his grandparents have been stuck in Paris for more than six weeks as they wait for their UK visa application to be processed. Kateryna Karpenko persuaded her nephew Nikita Shepel, and her parents Oleksandr and Vira, to flee Russian shelling and apply to come to join her in the UK, where she has lived for almost 10 years. But amid complaints that the UK Home Office has conducted a chaotic and overly-bureaucratic response to the Ukrainian refugee crisis, the estimated five working day wait for a visa has turned into more than a month in limbo, costing them thousands of pounds in accommodation. ""They had to go through a lot, fleeing Ukraine, and they have no idea what's happening with our home, our family, our lives,"" says Kateryna. A UK government spokesman said changes the Home Office has made to the system, including simpler forms and increase staff numbers, are working. Read more  US President Joe Biden has named the veteran diplomat Bridget Brink as the new US ambassador to Ukraine. Earlier today, the White House announced that Brink would be moving to fill ""a crucial position"", which has been vacant for the past three years. Washington said Brink's appointment came at a time when the US was ramping up its support for Ukraine, amid Russia's invasion. The new ambassador is currently serving as the US ambassador to Slovakia and has been a diplomat for 25 years. The White House added that Brink's ""decades of
experience make her uniquely suited for this moment in Ukraineâs
history"". A firefighter surveys the damage at an electricity substation powering the railway near Lviv We've been bringing you updates on the reports of attacks on railway infrastructure in Ukraine, which Ukrainian officials say killed five people. Earlier, Ukraine said Russia was trying to disrupt supply lines for military equipment from foreign countries. Now Russia has confirmed that was the purpose of the attacks, according to Reuters. The news agency is citing a statement from the Russian defence ministry, saying its missiles destroyed six facilities powering the railways that were used to supply Ukrainian forces with weapons from abroad. Ukrainian officials said five railway stations in the centre and west of the country came under attack within an hour this morning. An electricity substation powering overhead lines in Krasne, near Lviv, was also hit in a missile strike. Ukraine's defence minister has thanked the US for their military assistance - describing the relationship between the two nation's as as a ""true brotherhood"". Oleksii Reznikov's comments on Twitter follow the visit to Kyiv on Sunday by US Secretary of State Antony Blinken and US Defense Secretary Lloyd Austin. Mr Reznikov said the support given by the Biden administration is ""not measured in money, but in the saved lives of Ukrainians"". During the visit, it was announced that US diplomats will begin returning to Ukraine and the Washington will provide Ukraine with a further $700m in military aid. Mr Reznikov also shared a video where he can be seen shaking hands and embracing Austin, accompanied by the caption: ""This is more than partnership of state officials - this is true brotherhood.""

Macron defeats Le Pen and vows to unite FranceHe triumphs over his far-right rival and becomes the first president to win re-election in 20 years.,"This video can not be played France election: Macron pledges to unite France Emmanuel Macron has won five more years as France's president after a convincing victory over rival Marine Le Pen, who nevertheless secured the far right's highest share of the vote yet. He won by 58.55% to 41.45%, a greater margin than expected. The centrist leader told jubilant supporters at the foot of the Eiffel Tower that now the election was over he would be a ""president for all"". He is the first sitting president in 20 years to be re-elected. Despite her loss, Ms Le Pen, 53, said her significant vote share still marked a victory. France divided, EU delighted over Macron win Le Pen concedes but still counts a win The ideas her National Rally represented had reached new heights, she told her supporters. But far-right rival Eric Zemmour pointed out that she had ultimately failed, just like her father who preceded her: ""It's the eighth time the Le Pen name has been hit by defeat."" Marine Le Pen took over the party founded by her father Jean-Marie Le Pen in 2011 in a bid to make it electable. She won more than 13 million votes on Sunday, on a platform of tax cuts to tackle the high cost of living, a ban on wearing the Muslim headscarf in public and a referendum on immigration controls. ""An answer must be found to the anger and disagreements that led many of our compatriots to vote for the extreme right,"" Mr Macron said in his victory speech. ""It will be my responsibility and that of those around me."" More than one in three voters did not vote for either candidate.Turnout was just under 72%,external, the lowest in a presidential run-off since 1969, and more than three million people cast spoilt or blank votes. Much of France was on holiday on the day of the vote, but the low turnout also reflected the apathy of voters who complained neither candidate represented them. Voters who said they were casting blank ballots told the BBC they wanted to punish the sitting president. Anti-Macron demonstrators rallied in a number of cities, including Paris, Rennes, Toulouse and Nantes, refusing to accept the result. In his speech Mr Macron, 44, said his government would have to ""answer their choice to refuse to choose"". Far-left leader Jean-Luc MÃ©lenchon, who was narrowly beaten by Ms Le Pen in the first round of voting two weeks before, was scathing about both candidates. While it was good news France had refused to place its trust in Marine Le Pen, he claimed that Mr Macron had been elected with a worse result than any other president. ""He floats in an ocean of abstentions, and blank and spoiled ballots."" ANALYSIS:Historic win but Macron has polarised France Mr Macron's victory was welcomed by relieved European leaders, who had feared a far-right candidate offering a series of anti-EU policies. German Chancellor Olaf Scholz was first to congratulate him, singling out their mutual challenge in responding to Russia's war on Ukraine. US President Joe Biden also said he looked forward to ""close co-operation"" including on supporting Ukraine. This video can not be played Marine Le Pen: ""I will never abandon French people"" While Mr Macron has played a key diplomatic role in the war, Marine Le Pen has struggled to shake off accusations of ties to the Kremlin. Ukraine's Volodymyr Zelensky congratulated him as a ""true friend"" and said he looked forward to a strong and united Europe. UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson also welcomed his victory.

Mr Macron chose a highly symbolic venue from the French Revolution for his victory speech in the Champs de Mars. Accompanied by his wife Brigitte and leading a group of children, he walked to the stage accompanied by the EU anthem Ode to Joy before promising supporters that ""no-one will be left by the wayside"". Addressing voters who had backed him to keep the far right out of power he said he would be indebted to them for years to come. The cost of living crisis facing millions of French people became the number one issue of the election campaign, and the president's opponents accused him of arrogance and acting as a president of the rich. However, Prime Minister Jean Castex told French radio that the president's re-election sent a strong message, when France was going through a considerable crisis involving ""many divisions and a lack of understanding"". Mr Castex is now likely to be replaced in the next few days, and Mr Macron may ask Labour Minister Elisabeth Borne to take over. She refused to say whether she had been lined up to be the next prime minister, insisting that the focus had to be on dealing with people's worries about living standards. But a ministerial colleague, ClÃ©ment Beaune, said the president was definitely keen on having a female prime minister. For France's political leaders, the next task is to regroup and fight parliamentary elections in June. Mr Macron may have a majority for the moment, but defeated candidates from the first round already have the new campaign in sight and one opinion poll suggests 63% of voters want him to lose his majority. If that happened, he would be forced into a ""cohabitation"" with a government led by other parties. Mr MÃ©lenchon has already held out the prospect of defeating the president's centrist party and becoming prime minister. In her speech on Sunday night, Ms Le Pen told supporters that the ""match is not completely over"" and the risks of Mr Macron holding on to complete power were high. For now there is no talk of a change of leadership in her National Rally party. ""Everything will be rebuilt around her, she's at the head of this popular and social bloc,"" spokeswoman Laure Lavalette told French TV.

Live music revenue fell even further in 2021,"Concerts resumed last summer, initially as part of a government pilot scheme Royalties from live performances of music fell almost 30% in 2021, despite concerts resuming in the summer. Concert revenues were just Â£8m, down from Â£11.3m in 2020 and Â£54m in 2019, said PRS for Music, the body that collects royalties for songwriters. Only 19,300 setlists were reported last year, it added, marking a huge decline from the 124,000 reported pre-pandemic. ""It's a huge decrease,"" said CEO Andrea Martin, ""but we will see a bounce back this year."" She said there was ""renewed optimism"" in the sector, with more than 240 major tours planned for the UK this year. Acts likeDua Lipa, Little Mix andStormzyare already on the road, while stadium shows by Harry Styles, Elton John, The Rolling Stones and Adele are planned for the summer. However, Martin said, revenues are not expected to reach pre-pandemic levels until 2023. 'It's been a dark time for gigs, but we're back' Music venues call for further financial support Venues report 'catastrophic' audience declines Despite struggles in the live sector, PRS had a good year, collecting Â£777.1m in royalties - only slightly down on the pre-pandemic figure of Â£810m. ""I'm very excited and proud of these results because they show that the music industry is very resilient,"" said CEO Andrea Martin. ""It really shows that music connects and engages people and that we can bounce back."" The company said it processed 27 trillion ""performances"" of music last year, including streams, downloads, radio and TV broadcasts, as well as music played in pubs, clubs, hairdressers and concert venues. UK songwriters contributed to many of the year's most-played hits, including Ed Sheeran's Bad Habits, Dua Lipa's Levitating and Glass Animals' Heat Waves. The popularity of those songs, and others like Adele's Easy On Me, meant that streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music generated Â£225.5m in royalties - up 45% from two years ago. A new deal with TikTok also ensured artists would get royalties when their songs were used on the platform. The money generated from music featured on video-on-demand services like Netflix also doubled to Â£34.5m, as royalties from new services like Disney+ and Apple TV started to arrive. Public performance revenue - which includes the music played in shops, hotels, restaurants and nightclubs - also went up. However, PRS paid its members less (Â£677.2m) than in 2020 (Â£699.4m). Martin said this was due to the inherent ""lag"" in receiving royalties from abroad, which meant that the effects of 2020's downturn were only now being reflected in international payments.

Sexual offence victims face record court waits,"Serious sexual offences are taking the longest time on record to go through Crown Courts in England and Wales. Exclusive data compiled by the BBC found such cases averaged nine months to complete in 2021, with differences depending on where you live. Justice Secretary Dominic Raab said delays were caused by the pandemic but barristers blame funding cuts. Some victims have said they would consider not reporting such crimes due to their experiences of delays. Lisa, not her real name, was raped by someone she knew in 2017, but it took until late summer 2021 for her attacker to be convicted and jailed. ""I don't even have the words to explain how awful it has been,"" she said. Despite seeing justice, she said she had been left with no confidence in the system. ""God forbid it ever happened again, or to any of my family, but I wouldn't promote going through the system and even reporting a crime of this nature anymore."" The data from July to September 2021 reveals: The average case length for sexual offences was 266 days, or about nine months The longest period for sexual offence cases was in Leicester, which took 453 days (about 15 months) on average to go through the Crown Court Plymouth had the shortest wait for sexual offence cases to be completed, with an average of 76 days (about two and a half months) - meaning there is over a year's difference between the two courts The case length is considered to be the time from the first Crown Court hearing to the sentencing or end of a case. Separate national figures suggest the average case length for serious sexual offences has since risen to 270 days for October to December 2021. In the same time period, case lengths for robbery offences averaged 225 days (about seven months), while violence against the person was 206 days (about 6.5 months). Due to their nature, sexual offence cases increasingly involve large amounts of evidence gathered from mobile phones and social media - which can make things difficult for police, prosecutors and victims. Lisa went to the police with compelling evidence of what happened to her and felt confident her attacker would soon be in court. ""But it didn't happen in that way,"" she said. The Crown Prosecution Service eventually authorised the police to charge the suspect in the summer of 2019 - two years later. But because of backlogs, the earliest trial date available was April 2020. The closure of courts by the Covid pandemic meant the case was put back again until 2021. The attacker was not convicted and jailed until late summer 2021. ""I think if I hadn't reported it, I would have brought my mental health round a lot quicker than by extending the ordeal by having the additional impacts of the court system,"" Lisa said. A woman, who was a victim of a serious sexual assault when she was 15, told BBC Radio 4's Today programme her case had taken almost four years to conclude when her attacker pleaded guilty late last year. ""If I could take back reporting it to save myself the trauma that I was put through then I would in a heartbeat,"" she said. But the woman, now 19, added that to protect others from her assailant she would ""go through the whole thing again"". She said that when she found out her court hearing had been postponed from October 2020 to November 2021, due to the defendant living with someone who had Covid, it was like her body had ""just shut down"". ""It had already been two-and-a-half years and it was just about to be over and then it was taken away from under my feet."" Data about the Crown Courts - published here after BBC Freedom of Information requests - comes amid growing concerns about backlogs across courts andindustrial actionby barristers. Why do so few rape cases go to court? Campaigners say the problems could result in victims dropping their cases. Over the past four years, rape prosecutions in England and Wales have fallen by 70%. The latest available data shows the Crown Court backlog last December was 58,818 - down from a record of 61,000 cases earlier in 2021. The overall average time it now takes for all types of cases to go from a report to the police to completion in court is 697 days, just below the record of 708 days set last summer. This online tool reveals the average delays being seen court-by-court for serious sexual offences. Your device may not support this visualisation Inner London Crown Court and Harrow ranked highest in terms of having consistently long case lengths since the pandemic began, as opposed to just the latest quarter. Outside of London, St Albans, Bournemouth and Bradford saw longer cases than other areas most often. Criminal barristers say the current delays are the result of budget cuts, a decision to reduce how many days judges could sit and criminal barristers leaving for other branches of law. Figures from last week reveal the number of criminal barristers has fallen by 10% in the last year alone. ""We simply do not have sufficient numbers of judges, prosecutors, and defenders to deal with the backlog,"" said Jo Sidhu QC, chair of the Criminal Bar Association (CBA). The CBA says people are leaving for other branches of law because they can no longer make a living from cases that have to be funded through legal aid - the system that ensures that every defendant has professional representation to guarantee a fair trial. On Monday, the CBA's members began industrial action over the legal aid rates, saying the government is dragging its feet over implementing an independent review's recommendation for a 15% increase in funding. Thousands of barristers take action over legal aid Who gets legal aid? Mr Raab has warned barristers that their action will not solve the criminal justice delays they complain about - and that he will implement the increase in legal aid, and other reforms, following a legally-required consultation. The government has committed to keep operating some temporary courts that it set up to help manage the backlogs caused by the pandemic - and it has a commitment from the Treasury to fund unlimited sitting days of available judges for the next financial year. It has also introduced a system to allow more sexual offence victims to give their evidence in advance by video and is planning to move the sentencing of some lesser cases into magistrates' courts to ease the burden on judges. ""I know that it's very difficult for anyone that's been a victim of rape or serious sexual violence,"" Mr Raab said. ""You recover from the original crime - and then you've got to muster the courage to go through the [courts] process. I'm absolutely committed to making sure those victims have the support at every step of the way."" Sophia Chandler waited five years for a thief to face justice Opposition parties say the plan isn't good enough. ""This soft-on-crime Conservative Government cannot blame Covid for its ineptitude because case delays were growing long before the pandemic,"" said Steve Reed MP, Labour's shadow justice secretary. ""These findings are yet more evidence that the Conservatives are letting criminals off and letting victims down."" But despite long delays across all crimes, some victims still say they are willing to go through the court system. Sophia Chandler, who is blind, waited five years for a thief to face justice. She told police in Northamptonshire in 2017 that an assistant had been stealing from her home. The case was originally slated for trial in September 2020 - but it was then put off, relisted for September 2021 and then put off until January this year. When the opening day of the trial came, the defendant had disappeared, but she was convicted in her absence, eventually tracked down, and given an 18-week jail sentence, suspended for 18 months. Mrs Chandler said that she had been afraid to walk out in case the defendant approached her but she was now relieved the case was over. ""It took a long, long, long time,"" she says. ""I know that if it were to happen again, I would still go to the police and persevere. Otherwise there will be no justice.""

"Airlines should be fined for refund delays, MPs say","The UK's aviation watchdog should have stronger powers to protect passengers hit by the kind of disruption caused by the pandemic, MPs have recommended. The sector was hit hard by efforts to tackle the virus, including quarantine, testing regimes and travel bans. The Civil Aviation Authority should have ""more teeth"" to be able to fine airlines not giving refunds, a Commons Transport Committee report said. It also called for ministers to publish an aviation recovery plan by June. Aviation was one of the industries most affected by measures put in place to stop the spread of coronavirus. International travel was banned or heavily restricted in the early months of 2020 after the virus began to spread around the globe, and many customers had flights and holidays cancelled. When travel could resume, passengers were still subject to measures such as Covid testing, quarantine and passenger locator forms. And the government's traffic light system of categorising overseas countries meant flying into the UK from some destinations was still subject to bans, with changes to the ""red list"" every few weeks during the latter months of 2021 leaving people having to cancel trips at short notice or head home early. Travel firms confident sector will bounce back Heathrow warns return to normal travel years away Will travel return to normal this summer? In its report, UK Aviation: Reform For Take-Off, the Commons committee says that the regulator, the CAA, should be given the power to impose financial penalties on  airlines that do not completely refund customers when required to do so by law. It notes some Ryanair passengers are still waiting for compensation four years after being impacted by a 2018 pilot strike, because of the airline legally challenging CAA enforcement action. The committee also called for an airline insolvency bill to be introduced in the next session of parliament to better protect consumers, employees and taxpayers. Paul Smith, Consumer Director at the CAA, said: ""We have regularly asked for stronger consumer enforcement powers, including the ability to impose fines on airlines. This would allow us to take faster action when appropriate and bring our powers in line with other sectoral regulators."" The MPs welcomed ministers' pledges to only apply travel restrictions in ""extreme circumstances"" in future, and said the government ""must compensate the industry for the economic loss suffered"" if measures impacting the sector were reimposed. And plans should be established to ensure swift Covid testing is put in place if required by other countries, the MPs said. ""Now that government has removed all coronavirus-related restrictions on international travel, ministers must get on with protecting the sector against future economic shocks,"" said Huw Merriman, the Transport Committee chairman. The Conservative MP said the government had faced a difficult situation but some inconsistent policies had left industry and passengers confused.

Labour pledges to replace non-dom tax status,"Labour has pledged to replace the so-called ""non-dom"" taxpayer status in the UK after a row over the finances of Chancellor Rishi Sunak's wife. The party said it would abolish the ""unfair"" status, which allows UK residents whose permanent homes are abroad not to pay UK tax on overseas income. It would bring in a shorter-term scheme for temporary residents. Shadow chancellor Rachel Reeves said it would end ""outdated tax perks"". The UK government said non-doms played ""an important role in funding our public services"", with tax contributions estimated to be worth Â£6bn a year. But a Treasury spokesperson said it was ""only right that those who choose to live here for a long time pay their fair share of tax, which is why we reformed the rules in 2017 to end permanent non-dom status"". Currently, non-doms can keep the status for up to 15 years. What is a non-dom? Sunak: Inquiry into leak of wife's taxes begins Sunak's wife to pay UK tax on overseas income Ms Reeves told the BBC the status ""should not be available to a privileged few"" at a time when living costs were soaring and taxes going up. ""We need to do more to crackdown on some of the loopholes, which mean some of the wealthiest in society aren't paying their fair share of tax,"" she said. ""If you make Britain your home, you should be paying your taxes here."" Labour has previously been critical of the non-dom arrangement, and had pledged to scrap it under former leaders Jeremy Corbyn and Ed Miliband. The party said its decision to recommit to removing the status came as part of a wider review of its tax policies, announced by Ms Reeves at Labour Party conference in September. But it also follows a row earlier this month after emerged that Mr Sunak's wife, Akshata Murty, had claimed non-dom status through her father, Narayana Murty - the billionaire founder of Indian software giant Infosys. The BBC estimated this would have saved her Â£2.1m a year in UK tax on dividend payments from her shares in the company. After a political backlash, Ms Murty announced that although she would remain a non-dom, she wouldpay UK tax on her overseas income. Akshata Murty with her husband, Rishi Sunak Labour has said, if it wins power after the next general election, it would replace the status with a shorter-term arrangement similar to those in France, Germany and Canada. Ms Reeves said the status could last ""as long as five years"" for residents who qualify. ""But between six months and five years is what other countries do and we would consult [businesses] on that,"" she added. Labour has not provided further details of its plan, but said it would be a ""clear, simple, and modern system"". Ms Reeves added: ""With Labour, people who make the UK their home will contribute to this country by paying tax on their global income."" The Treasury said it considered non-dom status to be an important feature of the UK's tax system and said it wanted to continue attracting ""talent to work and live in the UK"". A non-dom is a UK resident who declares their permanent home, or domicile, outside of the UK. A domicile is usually the country his or her father considered his permanent home when they were born, or it may be the place overseas somebody has moved to with no intention of returning. For proof to the tax authority, non-doms have to provide evidence about their background, lifestyle and future intentions - such as where they own property or intend to be buried. Those who have the status must still pay UK tax on UK earnings, but do not need to pay UK tax on foreign income. They can give up their non-dom status at any time. According to the latest figures from HM Revenue and Customs, there were 75,700 people claiming non-dom status in the UK in the tax year ending 2020. Read morehere.

"Days of disruption expected due to strike actionCouncils, the Housing Executive and some schools face up to two weeks of disruption from Monday.Northern Ireland","Workers protest outside a Housing Executive office on Monday, as it, councils and some schools face two weeks of disruption Councils, the Housing Executive and some schools face up to two weeks of disruption from Monday due to strike action by the Unite union. Unite members in most councils and the Housing Executive started a walk-out on Monday in a dispute over pay. The union's members in the Education Authority (EA) then begin strike action from Tuesday 26 April. The action follows a previous walk-out byUnite members in March over a local government pay offer of 1.75%. The union has called that a ""real-terms pay cut"" asthe cost of living has been surgingdue to rising fuel, energy and food costs. Unite's Northern Ireland Officer Gareth Scott said employers were to blame for the resumption of strike action. Special school transport faces strike disruption ""These employers need to address the pay expectations of their workforce,"" he said in a statement. ""Their failure to do so to date has led to this escalation and the unnecessary disruption that will inevitably result."" Council services likely to be affected include some bin collections But the EA has said the Unite strike comes after a local government pay offer across England, Wales and Northern Ireland which has already been accepted by the majority of trade unions. ""Therefore, local government organisations, including EA, do not have the power or authority to renegotiate this for Northern Ireland,"" the authority said. Some EA yellow bus services, which take pupils to school, will not operate for two weeks from Tuesday. However, school bus services operated by Translink will run as normalfollowing the postponement of a possible strike by bus drivers. The EA also said that some special schools faced disruption as some non-teaching staff, including classroom assistants, would be on strike. One special school - Glenveagh in Belfast - hasalready said the dispute will mean that its pupils will not be able to come into school for almost two weeks. The EA said it had asked Unite for special school staff and bus drivers to be exempted from the strike action but the union refused. ""We firmly believe these requests to be reasonable and valid and we remain unclear about the basis for them to be rejected by Unite given the impact on some of the most vulnerable children,"" the authority added. The Education Authority said it had asked Unite for special school staff and bus drivers to be exempted from the strike action, but the union refused Meanwhile, the Housing Executive has said some of its scheduled repair services for tenants in Craigavon, Coleraine and north and west Belfast are likely to be affected until 8 May. Council services likely to be affected include some bin collections, street cleaning and the operation of some venues. For instance,Belfast City Council,externalsaid that City Hall, Belfast Zoo, and some community centres, play centres, sports pitches, bowling greens, parks and public toilets could be closed on some days during the strike. Derry City and Strabane District Council,externalsaid it expected there to be ""disruption to a range of services such as refuse collection, street cleansing, recycling centres, leisure facilities and a number of other services"". It said ""the level of impact will be variable across all services"". 25 April-1 May and 3 May-8 May: Unite members in the NI Housing Executive; nine councils (Antrim and Newtownabbey; Armagh, Banbridge & Craigavon; Causeway Coast & Glens; Mid & East Antrim; Belfast City; Derry City & Strabane; Fermanagh & Omagh; Lisburn & Castlereagh; and Mid-Ulster); and three further education colleges (North West Regional College; Belfast Metropolitan College; South Eastern Regional College) 26 April-1 May and 3 May-8 May: Unite members at the Education Authority 3 May-15 May: Unite members at Ards & North Down Borough Council 6 May: Unite members at Newry, Mourne and Down District Council Special school transport faces strike disruption Union 'wouldn't exempt special schools' from strike Why are prices rising in the UK?

Whistleblower vet awarded Â£1.25m and apology,"This video can not be played Dr Tamara Bronckaers: ""It made me fearful going into work."" A former government vet has received a Â£1.25m settlement from the Department of Agriculture and Environment, along with an ""unreserved"" apology. Dr Tamara Bronckaers resigned from the Department in 2018. This came after concerns she raised about animal welfare and failures in traceability in the meat supply chain were not acted on. An industrialtribunal in September 2021 found she had been constructively dismissed. The department dropped its appeal against that decision earlier this month. On Monday, it issued a statement in which it apologised to Ms Bronckaers for the ""hurt and distress caused"". In a statement issued by her solicitors, McCartan Turkington Breen, Dr Bronckaers said the last few years had been ""extremely harrowing"", and she could now ""move on in the knowledge that I did what was right"". Dr Bronckaers had worked at the department for 19 years before she resigned in February 2018. The industrial tribunal heard she was regarded as an expert on livestock market legislation. Taskforce to tackle animal traceability issues Vet unfairly dismissed by Department of Agriculture Her responsibilities included livestock markets, biosecurity and zoonoses - diseases that can move between animals and humans. Dr Bronckaers had identified serious failings in animal welfare at some livestock markets, and the abuse of a process called ""deleted moves"". That was a process whereby a dealer would buy an animal, without having someone to immediately sell it on to. The move was allowed to be deleted when the animal did not leave the market before being sold on. But Dr Bronckaers found out that the animal would sometimes leave the market to join the dealer's herd for a period of time before a buyer was found, and that move would then be deleted from the section of the tracing system that was visible in markets. Dr Bronckaers said the past few years had been ""harrowing"" It remained in the section visible at departmental level. Animals with fewer moves in their history are more valuable. That, Dr Bronckaers claimed, could affect the traceability of meat within the food supply chain and have an impact on the spread of disease in cattle, in particular tuberculosis. She told the tribunal that 4,800 to 5,000 animals were having their moves deleted out of livestock markets every year. Dr Bronckaers also took photographic evidence of alleged animal abuse at Ballymena Livestock Market after a tip-off that sheep had been kept there overnight. By law, sheep may be left overnight at a livestock market but must have bedding, water and food. Dr Bronckaers told the tribunal last year some livestock market operators were not adhering to statutory duties However Dr Bronckaers said she found pens overcrowded with sheep and a lack of food and drink. ""The sheep were empty looking - which means their sides were fallen in as they weren't fed. ""Sheep don't usually drink out of a bucket easily but they were coming for it in the bucket."" She added: ""While we were there a double-decker lorry arrived with 100-plus sheep and they were just loaded in to the pens in the yard. ""The legislation is very specific about the need for the market to be fenced and disinfected before another sale to break the risk of disease spreading. ""That was also worrying."" In a statement, Ballymena Livestock Market said it had ""zero tolerance when it comes to animal cruelty"" and regrets ""if there were any instances where those standards were less than what we ourselves demand"". ""We have re-examined what happened in the case referenced during the employment tribunal and must acknowledge our disappointment at what was alleged. ""The alleged incident occurred five years ago. Our animal welfare systems then were robust and in the intervening period, they have been further enhanced and strengthened. ""Hay and water are provided to animals left overnight and pens continue to be regularly disinfected."" Dr Bronckaers said her concerns over livestock movement and Ballymena Livestock Market were reported to colleagues, including her line manager Dr Julian Henderson, but not acted on. Many of her e-mails were ignored. The tribunal judge said Dr Bronckaers had been reasonable to persist in raising her concerns, and that she had been professionally ignored, undermined and excluded by Dr Henderson in particular. He has recently beentemporarily promoted to the post of deputy chief vet,external. The judge also found it was reasonable for Dr Bronckaers to regard the chief vet Robert Huey's actions towards her as ""intimidating, patronising, belittling and dismissive of her as a professional"". Dr Bronckaers said the past few years have been ""harrowing"" Speaking to The Nolan Show, Dr Bronckaers explained why it was so important that her concerns should have been taken more seriously. Some Â£40m a year isspent trying to keep TB out of herds in Northern Ireland,external, according to the department. ""That's why I was worried,"" she said. ""As vets we have to trace back all animals in a TB herd and there was no way we could see where these animals came from so we were missing potentially a source of TB infection."" She said the process had affected her mental health and family life. ""I wasn't sleeping. I was crying a lot going into work.  I didn't know from day to day what would happen,"" she told the programme. ""Anyone who has a profession you don't go home and switch off. I'm a vet - that's my life,"" she added. Dr Bronckaers' solicitor said the Â£1.25m settlement was the largest of its type in Northern Ireland. ""The outcome for Dr Bronckaers is wholly justified, bearing in mind the detriments she has suffered that have not only affected her career, but her family and her financial situation,"" said John McShane. ""I am quite simply astounded by Dr Bronckaers' bravery. She was willing to do what was ethically right to the detriment of herself, her family, and her standard of living in retirement.  It is a choice that very few people would make as the easier path would have been to keep quiet. ""Hopefully, the outcome of this landmark case provides reassurance that at the very least, those individuals who choose to whistle blow do have protection under the law."" Dr Bronckaers said she ""strongly believed the department was failing in its duty to protect animal welfare and therefore I couldn't continue doing a job that I wasn't being allowed to carry out ethically"". ""I couldn't sit back and watch these breaches persist,"" she said. ""The past few years have been extremely harrowing for me and my family. ""This outcome has been a long time coming and I can move on in the knowledge that I did what was right, and I now have a long-awaited and justified apology from the department."" The department said that following the outcome of the case in October 2021, the department established an Internal Audit Review of Cattle Traceability System within the Veterinary Animal Health Group. ""The department can reassure the public and the agri-food industry that it will continue to review its risk management tools and will seek to strengthen the controls where necessary for animal traceability to ensure continued confidence in the system,"" it said. ""The department takes extremely seriously all the matters which contributed to the outcome of the recent tribunal and will be progressing an internal review into them. This review is being undertaken with urgency and will be completed at pace.""

"Live music revenue fell even further in 2021Royalties for live music were down almost 30% last year, but a recovery is on the horizon.","Concerts resumed last summer, initially as part of a government pilot scheme Royalties from live performances of music fell almost 30% in 2021, despite concerts resuming in the summer. Concert revenues were just Â£8m, down from Â£11.3m in 2020 and Â£54m in 2019, said PRS for Music, the body that collects royalties for songwriters. Only 19,300 setlists were reported last year, it added, marking a huge decline from the 124,000 reported pre-pandemic. ""It's a huge decrease,"" said CEO Andrea Martin, ""but we will see a bounce back this year."" She said there was ""renewed optimism"" in the sector, with more than 240 major tours planned for the UK this year. Acts likeDua Lipa, Little Mix andStormzyare already on the road, while stadium shows by Harry Styles, Elton John, The Rolling Stones and Adele are planned for the summer. However, Martin said, revenues are not expected to reach pre-pandemic levels until 2023. 'It's been a dark time for gigs, but we're back' Music venues call for further financial support Venues report 'catastrophic' audience declines Despite struggles in the live sector, PRS had a good year, collecting Â£777.1m in royalties - only slightly down on the pre-pandemic figure of Â£810m. ""I'm very excited and proud of these results because they show that the music industry is very resilient,"" said CEO Andrea Martin. ""It really shows that music connects and engages people and that we can bounce back."" The company said it processed 27 trillion ""performances"" of music last year, including streams, downloads, radio and TV broadcasts, as well as music played in pubs, clubs, hairdressers and concert venues. UK songwriters contributed to many of the year's most-played hits, including Ed Sheeran's Bad Habits, Dua Lipa's Levitating and Glass Animals' Heat Waves. The popularity of those songs, and others like Adele's Easy On Me, meant that streaming services like Spotify and Apple Music generated Â£225.5m in royalties - up 45% from two years ago. A new deal with TikTok also ensured artists would get royalties when their songs were used on the platform. The money generated from music featured on video-on-demand services like Netflix also doubled to Â£34.5m, as royalties from new services like Disney+ and Apple TV started to arrive. Public performance revenue - which includes the music played in shops, hotels, restaurants and nightclubs - also went up. However, PRS paid its members less (Â£677.2m) than in 2020 (Â£699.4m). Martin said this was due to the inherent ""lag"" in receiving royalties from abroad, which meant that the effects of 2020's downturn were only now being reflected in international payments.

"Nigeria in trauma after blast deaths - presidentPresident Buhari calls the deaths of more than 100 people in an explosion ""a national disaster"".","A picture from the scene of the explosion shows burned out vehicles Nigeria's president has said the country is in ""shock and trauma"" following the deaths of at least 100 people from an explosion at an illegal oil refinery. President Muhammadu Buhari described the incident in Imo state, southern Nigeria, as a ""catastrophe and a national disaster"". Many victims were burnt beyond recognition. The police are now looking for the owner of the illegal refinery. The damage to fishing and farming caused by the oil industry over the decades and the failure to share the oil wealth has led some to find other ways to make money. Illegal refining is attractive as in parts of the oil-rich Niger Delta it is seen as being relatively easy to pull off, despite efforts to halt the practice. Dozens of people were thought to have been working at the refining plants when they were caught in the huge fire. The death toll has risen as emergency workers go through the scene. Ifeanyi Nnaji of the National Emergency Management Agency told BBC Igbo that the number killed now stood at 109. ""We learnt many bodies are in nearby bushes and forests as some illegal operators and their patrons scampered for safety,"" he earlier told the AFP news agency. Charred human remains, as well as fragments of belongings, such as flip flops, bags and clothing, were witnessed across the scene of the disaster by a journalist for the Reuters news agency. In a statement on Sunday, Mr Buhari offered his condolences to families of the victims and said those responsible for the explosions must be caught and brought to justice. The authorities have been struggling to curb the proliferation of illegal plants where stolen crude oil is refined. The president ordered security forces to intensify efforts to shut these refineries. It is not yet clear what caused the explosion that happened sometime overnight into Saturday, but accidents have been common in the past at similar dangerous sites where safety measures are not enforced. There have been concerns over a lack of precautions at such facilities as well as over the environmental pollution they cause. But Nigeria's official oil refineries do not work to capacity, causing frequent fuel shortages and price increases across the country.

P&O forced to reverse attempt at pay cutThe ferry firm had asked recently-employed agency workers to sign new contracts with reduced wages.Business,"P&O Ferries has been forced to reverse an attempt to pay its new, cheaper agency workers even less money. It comes after the RMT Union received reports of agency workers at Dover being asked to sign new contracts replacing their old ones on lower pay. The union reported P&O Ferries to the Maritime and Coastguard Agency, which ensured the new workers retained their original wages. The company has been asked for comment but has so far not responded. P&O Ferries sacked almost 800 employees last month and brought in cheaper agency workers on some of its boats, in a move it said would ensure the future of the business. However, the National Union of Rail, Maritime and Transport Workers (RMT) said the firm was now ""trying to bring in an exploitative model, with the lowest possible standards they can get away with"". RMT said that a seafarer on the Spirit of Britain ferry at Dover had initially contacted the union begging for help in a dispute over pay. In an email seen by the BBC the worker wrote: ""They don't care about our rights. They try to give us less money. We are desperate."" Transport Secretary Grant Shapps said it was ""good P&O have reversed [the] further attempt at a pay cut"", but added that ""they must go much further and pay the minimum wage like all UK businesses"". ""We will legislate to force them, but they could win back some much needed credibility by acting now,"" he said. The Spirit of Britain resumed cross channel services this weekend On Friday, the Spirit of Britainwas cleared to resume sailingafter inspections by the Maritime and Coastguard Agency. It had been held at the port since 12 April due to a number of unspecified deficiencies, according to the regulator. It is P&O's first Dover to Calais ferry to recommence operations, with services set to resume on Tuesday morning. The seafarer who contacted the RMT told the union that they were being forced to work without contracts, after old ones had expired. The worker claimed documents had also been lost by P&O. The worker wrote in their email to the union: ""This is my sixth day working without a contract, please help us!"" On Friday, the RMT went aboard the Spirit of Britain to speak with seafarers after being previously refused access. National secretary Darren Proctor, who was on the visit, said P&O Ferries initially did not want to let them on, instead offering the use of a meeting room in the port. The RMT declined, quoting the ISPS Code, which is a comprehensive set of measures designed to strengthen the security of ships and port facilities. Once on board, the union's representatives were chaperoned to a new lounge on the ferry for pets, where the RMT inspectors were able to speak directly to newly employed workers. The RMT said it had spoken to a number of workers from around the world who have joined the ferry's crew who shared similar complaints. P&O resumes full Cairnryan - Larne service Are the P&O Ferries sackings legal? New ferry rules on pay wonât work, warn ports Mr Proctor said P&O Ferries had ""brought people in on a month contract, some on two-month contracts"" and then told them that they have to accept lower pay rates if they want to stay on. ""Others are coming in on four-month contracts on lower pay. P&O is undermining safety and creating a lowest possible denominator in ferry standards,"" he said. The union complained to the Maritime and Coastguard Authority (MCA) who took action and affected seafarers' contracts were amended with their original wages reinstated. RMT said that P&O was ""desperate to keep these new crew on board because they've been on board for four weeks now and these crews were beginning to have familiarity with the vessels. They need familiarity to get them sailing again."" Tim Morris, chief of trade association UK Major Ports Group, said P&O Ferries' newest move was ""clearly not great news for the reputation for maritime in the UK"". He told the BBC's Today programme the ports industry was ""disappointed and surprised as everyone else on what has gone on"". ""It's not how we operate in the ports sector,"" he said. ""We hire locally, we pay well, we have well established industrial relations."" Mr Morris said there was a law that stopped port operators ""picking and choosing who we let into our ports outside of some very narrow safety constraints"". ""Whilst we're as disappointed and surprised as everybody else, there needs to be a change in the law before employment conditions can be linked to port access,"" he added. This video can not be played P&O Ferries boss Peter Hebblethwaite faces MPs Last month, P&O Ferries boss Peter Hebblethwaite admitted to MPs that the decision to sack 800 workers last month without notice broke the law. He said there was ""absolutely no doubt"" that under UK employment law the firm was required to consult unions before making the mass cuts. However, he said no union would have accepted the plan and it was easier to compensate workers ""in full"" instead. The P&O boss also said he would make the same decision again if he had to. Mr Shapps has said he wanted to see British ports refusing access to ferry companies ""who don't pay a fair wage"". He said the government would consult on the changes needed to make it a legal requirement, but urged ports to take action ""as soon as practical"". However, British ports have described the new pay plans for the ferry industry as ""unworkable"". ""The ports industry is genuinely sympathetic towards the situation of the impacted seafarers, however we would suggest that ports are not the competent authorities to enforce rules on employee salaries or working conditions in the shipping industry,"" said Richard Ballantyne of the British Ports Association.
