'Upskirting' row MP says he supports ban,"The Conservative MP who blocked a bill that would have made ""upskirting"" a criminal offence has said he ""wholeheartedly"" supports such a law. Had the law passed, someone secretly taking a photo up a woman's skirt could have faced up to two years in prison. Speaking to his local paper, the Bournemouth Echo,external, Sir Christopher Chope said he was objecting to parliamentary procedure rather than the law itself. The Christchurch MP said he was not ""a dinosaur"" and was being ""scapegoated"". Prime Minister Theresa May said she was ""disappointed"" that one of her own MPs had prevented the bill from progressing. This video can not be played Theresa May was asked why she recommended Sir Christopher Chope for a knighthood She added that she wanted to see the measures passed soon. I was a victim of 'upskirting' - but I'm fighting back Speaker calls for private members' bills rethink May 'disappointed' at upskirting law block Sir Christopher said upskirting was ""vulgar, humiliating and unacceptable"" and said accusations he was ""some kind of pervert"" were ""a complete travesty of the truth"". ""It's defamatory of my character and it's very depressing some of my colleagues have been perpetuating that in the past 48 hours,"" he added. This video can not be played Hear MPs shout ""shame"" after Sir Christopher objects to the bill He explained that he stopped the bill from progressing because he disapproved of how the legislation was being brought in. ""The government has been hijacking time that is rightfully that of backbenchers,"" he said. ""This is about who controls the House of Commons on Fridays and that's where I am coming from."" He accused the government of trying to ""bring in what it wants on the nod"", adding: ""We don't quite live in the Putin era yet."" The bill was expected to sail through the Commons on Friday, but parliamentary rules mean it only required one MP to shout ""object"" to block its progress. Sir Christopher's intervention was met with shouts of ""shame"" from other MPs. His actions were attacked by MPs - many from his own party. Scottish Conservative MP Paul Masterton said the intervention did ""damage"" to the public's view of the party.

There is no law specifically naming and banning upskirting in England and Wales - victims and police are currently only able to pursue offences of outraging public decency or as a crime of voyeurism Upskirting has been an offence in Scotland since 2010 when it was listed under the broadened definition of voyeurism What are the limitations of the current situation in England and Wales? Voyeurism only applies to filming actions taking place in private Outraging public decency usually requires someone to have witnessed the action but upskirting is often unobserved Unlike other sexual offences, people don't have an automatic right to anonymity What does the new law propose? As well as carrying a maximum two-year sentence, it would also allow, in the most serious cases, those convicted to be placed on the sex offenders register Law to make upskirting illegal considered Call to make 'upskirting' an offence I was a victim of 'upskirting' - but I'm fighting back Speaker calls for private members' bills rethink Death toll rises amid most destructive wildfire in Los Angeles' history In maps: Thousands of acres on fire in LA 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Chris Mason: Is Starmer leaving the door open to an abuse inquiry?

Medical cannabis ban 'bizarre and cruel',"This video can not be played Charlotte Caldwell said the medication ordeal had been 'horrific and cruel' A senior MP leading an all-party group looking at medical cannabis has called the existing laws ""bizarre and cruel"". Sir Mike Penning MP has called for ""fundamental reform"" of the system. ""Medical cannabis is a health issue, not a misuse of drugs issue,"" Sir Mike said in a statement. ""It's about patients and relieving suffering."" It follows the home secretary's decision to grant 12-year-old Billy Caldwell temporary access to cannabis oil medication to treat his epilepsy. Mr Penning, who is the proposed chairman of the new All Party Parliamentary Group (APPG) on Medical Cannabis Under Prescription, said: ""It's bizarre and cruel that we have a system that allows the medical use of strong opiates, but bars the medical use of cannabis. ""The current structures within government on this issue are not fit for purpose. We need to move this from criminal justice to health."" He said he supported reclassifying cannabis under the law so it would be regarded as having a medicinal use. Last Monday officials at Heathrow airport confiscated Billy's cannabis oil,  which his mother Charlotte uses to treat his severe epileptic seizures. She had been attempting to bring a supply into the UK from Canada. Ms Caldwell says her son's seizures dramatically reduce when he takes the oil, which contains a substance called Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) that is illegal in the UK. Following the confiscation, Billy was admitted to hospital in London after his seizures ""intensified"". His condition led to Home Secretary Sajid Javid later approving the return of some of the cannabis oil, after doctors made clear it was a medical emergency. Billy was admitted to Chelsea and Westminster hospital in London on Friday The Home Office has granted a limited licence for the drug to be administered to the child in hospital for 20 days. Billy's case has prompted a renewed debate on the legislation surrounding medical cannabis. Sir Mike said many more families needed ""urgent"" access to medical cannabis, adding that the medical use of cannabis was ""totally separate from recreational use"". CBD and Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are two types of cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant. A cannabis-based drug called Sativex has been licensed in the UK to treat MS. It contains THC and CBD. Doctors could, in theory, prescribe it for other things outside of this licence, but at their own risk. MS patients prescribed Sativex, who resupply it to other people, also face prosecution. Another licensed treatment is Nabilone. It contains an artificial version of THC and can be given to cancer patients to help relieve nausea during chemotherapy. Source:NHS Choices,external Sir Mike is one of a growing number of MPs from all parties who support the reform of the laws regarding the medicinal use of cannabis and cannabis products. Fellow Conservative Crispin Blunt MP, co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on drug policy reform, said the existing law was ""frankly absurd"". Ex-Tory health minister Dan Poulter said the current situation was ""ridiculous"" and pledged to push for a change in the law. Former drugs minister Norman Baker, a Liberal Democrat, has described the confiscation as ""cruel and inhumane"", and renewed calls for a law change citing cannabis's ""useful medical properties"". But UCL's Dr Michael Bloomfield said the use of medical marijuana is ""far from straightforward"". He said in some jurisdictions the drug's use for medical conditions is ""a potential way of decriminalising cannabis through the back door"". Many other countries, including much of the US, Germany, Italy and the Netherlands, have legalised the substance's use medicinally.

Fears for future of Glasgow art school,"The art school building has been devastated by the fire The fire-ravaged structure of the Glasgow School of Art may have to be demolished, a leading construction expert has warned. Billy Hare, a professor of construction management, said there was a ""growing consensus"" the globally-significant building may have to be pulled down. It came as fire crews spent a second day working to extinguish the blaze, which also damaged the O2 ABC venue. Art school staff have seen the damaged Mackintosh building for the first time. They were able to see what remains of the historic shell from the college's adjoining buildings. Muriel Grey, the chairwoman of the board of the governors, said: ""It is an understatement to say everyone is utterly devastated."" Fire chiefs said the fire had largely been contained and thermal imaging cameras were being used to identify any remaining hotspots. Prof Hare, deputy director of The Beam Research Centre at Glasgow Caledonian University, warned that the building could be structurally unsound. This video can not be played Aerial footage shows scale of the Glasgow School of Art fire He compared the intensity of the blaze with a fire which started in the roof of a building housing Victoria's nightclub in nearby Sauchiehall Street in March. Within days of that fire,Glasgow City Council confirmed it would demolish the building. Prof Hare told BBC Scotland:  ""At that stage the decision was taken fairly quickly to demolish that building. ""However, the Mack being such a globally-recognised building of significance, this would probably have a bit more deliberation before they come to that decision. ""But the consensus is beginning to grow over the last 24 hours that that might very well be the case."" How Glasgow earned its reputation as the 'Tinderbox City' Timeline: The art school's devastating years 'I assumed it was a social media blip' The world's love of Glasgow School of Art He said if it was not possible to retain the facade of the building, it may be possible to take down the building brick-by-brick and rebuild with a new internal frame. A painstaking project such as that could cost in excess of Â£100m, he warned. As it was: the art school building was under reconstruction from the first fire in 2014 After the fire: the art school and a neighbouring building have been devastated, Friday night's blaze was the second to hit the Charles Rennie Mackintosh-designed building in four years. It was undergoing an extensive restoration, costing up to Â£35m, while staff and students worked in neighbouring buildings on the campus. The Mackintosh building was under the day-to-day control of Kier Construction. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon described the damage from the latest fire as ""heartbreaking"". Miles Glendinning, a professor of architectural conservation, told BBC Radio Scotland that the building ""should be restored and will be restored"". He said ""remarkable"" record-keeping during the restoration process following the 2014 fire meant the art school still exists in digital form. Speaking to Good Morning Scotland, he said: ""A Glasgow School of Art project team [made] a digital recording reconstruction of the whole building, not just the bit that was affected before, down to the nearest millimetre, outside and in, using photos and measured drawings. ""So the building still exists digitally even if the inside is for the moment physically absent."" He said he would be ""very surprised"" if the building had to be knocked down and rebuilt, saying the walls could instead be reinforced. In a statement released by Glasgow School of Art on Sunday evening, Muriel Gray said they had a ""difficult waiting game"" while investigations were carried out into the condition of the building. ""We remain hopeful of as positive an outcome as possible because it is clear that the love for the Mackintosh and recognition of its importance to Glasgow and the wider world is shared by absolutely everyone,"" she added. The art school's director Prof Tom Inns said its priority was to continue to operate the school with minimum disruption to staff and students. Meanwhile, Scottish Secretary David Mundell ruled out a public inquiry into the blaze ""unless someone can bring forward some exceptional reason"". He said various investigations would be held into the cause of the fire - as with any other similar incident. Scottish Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop was also asked about the possibility of a public inquiry on BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland. She said: ""I understand people want a lot of questions answered but clearly we have to have the fire investigation first and we have to give them the time to carry out their very responsible duties to best effect."" The fire could be seen throughout Glasgow city centre Firefighters continue to damp down the fire at the Mackintosh building and the O2 ABC music venue Labour MP Paul Sweeney, who visited the site on Saturday night,shared several videos on Twitter,externalshowing the damaged building from different angles. He described part of the 1909 library extension as a ""tangled mess of charred timber and distorted steel joists"" - but added that some structural joists and outer walls appear to be solid and stable. He said the eastern wing, which dates from 1899, appears to have been hit worse - with some of the stone ""baked"", fractured or ""visibly moved"" by the heat. The neighbouring O2 ABC collapsed and glass panels on a building opposite shattered from the high temperature, Mr Sweeney added. Allow Twitter content?

The Glasgow North East MP raised concerns about the role of the contractor, Kier Construction. ""I have to say it's extremely worrying that within the space of four years, this could happen again,"" he said. ""Questions have to be raised about the contractor and how the contractor who had responsibility for the site has managed that site if the security had been sufficient, and so on."" Kier Construction said it was devastated by the fire and was working closely with the fire service in their investigation. No-one was injured by the fire, which was reported at about 23:20 on Friday. At the height of the blaze, a total of 120 firefighters and 20 fire engines were at the scene and nearby homes were evacuated as a precaution. Hoses brought water from the River Clyde to help fight the flames. A total of 50 firefighters, six fire engines and two high-reach appliances remained at the scene on Sunday. The fire service said it was too early to speculate on the cause, adding that forensic experts would not be able to gain access to the building until it had been made safe. Group Manager Martin Hill said: ""This has clearly been a protracted incident and today we are still very much in a firefighting phase. ""Our firefighters have been working effectively throughout the night and we are continuing to dampen down any remaining pockets of fire. ""We will remain on the scene for as long as it takes - we are absolutely committed to preventing any further damage to surrounding properties and ensuring the area is made safe."" The fire ripped through the newly-restored building on Friday night Chief officer Alasdair Hay would not be drawn on whether the building would have to be pulled down over safety fears. He said the fire service was working with structural engineers and Glasgow City Council's building control department during the operation. ""This is a heartbreaking incident and if we could take any solace from it, there has been no injuries,"" he told the BBC News Channel. ""And what we want to absolutely avoid at this stage is for anyone to get injured, so we are being very cautious."" Sturgeon says blaze is 'heartbreaking' The story of the fire and its aftermath Scotland reacts to Glasgow art school fire First Minister Nicola Sturgeon visited the site on Saturday. She said: ""The fire has been a devastating blaze, much worse than the one that took hold of the Mackintosh building four years ago. ""The damage is severe and extensive. My heart goes out to everybody associated with the art school."" Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish government stood ""ready to provide any support"" in the wake of the blaze. Prime Minister Theresa May said the UK government would support the Scottish government in restoration efforts. The A-listed building, considered to be Charles Rennie Mackintosh's masterpiece, wasbadly damaged in a blaze in May 2014. The Mackintosh building was completed in 1909 based on designs by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Scotland's most-lauded designer. Glasgow School of Art has produced a number of leading contemporary artists, including Douglas Gordon, Alison Watt, David Shrigley, and  recent Turner Prize winners Simon Starling, Richard Wright and Martin Boyce.

Bodies of father and son found in canal,"The men were magnet fishing - which involves using a magnet to locate objects in water Police divers have found the bodies of a father and son who went missing while magnet fishing. The men are believed to have been trawling the bottom of a canal with a magnet to find metal objects in the water when they died. West Yorkshire Police said their bodies were recovered on Saturday night after an extensive search in the Cooper Bridge area of Huddersfield. The force said it was not treating the deaths as suspicious. A police spokesman said the alarm was raised by a passer-by who noticed personal belongings, including clothing, a mobile phone, a camera and car keys, were on the waterside for almost an hour. Yorkshire breaking news: Water main burst forces Leeds' junction closure; Investigation into factory blaze continues He said officers traced a car parked nearby to the Pudsey area of Leeds, where a woman confirmed that her 43-year-old husband and his 19-year-old son had gone out magnet fishing early in the morning. Fisherman Stephen Hydes said a man who was bird watching nearby raised the alarm The spokesman said an extensive search was carried out in the area but there was no trace of the two men and police divers were called in. The bodies of the men were found just before 19:30 BST. ""The family are aware and inquiries are ongoing into how they ended up in the water,"" he said. Fisherman Stephen Hydes said he saw belongings, including two jackets on the side of the water on what was the first day of the fishing season. He said there was a length of rope tied to the lock, which went up on the bank. Another man who was bird watching nearby raised the alarm, Mr Hydes added.

Taliban ends truce despite pleas,"This video can not be played Tears, hugs and selfies as Afghan troops and Taliban mark a truce for Eid A widely welcomed three-day ceasefire between security forces and the Taliban in Afghanistan appears to be over. The Taliban said its militants had been ordered to take up arms again on Sunday night - now the Eid festival had ended. The government says it will continue a unilateral ceasefire for another 10 days, although security forces can defend themselves if attacked. There were unprecedented scenes of soldiers and Taliban insurgents hugging each other during the ceasefire. But the ceasefire failed to end violence entirely. At least 18 people were killed in a suicide attack in the city of Jalalabad, outside the office of the governor of Nangarhar province while officials were meeting Taliban insurgents. Dozens were injured. No group said it carried out the attack. What's life like under the Taliban? Militants 'threaten 70% of Afghanistan' Who are the Taliban? On Saturday a suicide bombing in the same province, also on a gathering of Taliban and local officials, left 36 people dead. The Islamic State group said it carried out that attack. The militants said there would be no extension to the ceasefire and fighters would be expected to leave government-controlled areas before sunset. A militant hugs a member of the Afghan police in Kunduz In a statement, the Taliban said it had called the ceasefire to enable ordinary Afghans to enjoy a peaceful Eid, ""not in response to the ceasefire of the Kabul regime"". The group hailed the success of the ceasefire as a sign of its cohesion, and reasserted its determination to seek the ""withdrawal of foreign invaders and establishment of an Islamic government"". President Ashraf Ghani's plea on Saturday for the Taliban to prolong its truce has been rejected. His office said on Sunday that the government's extended truce would still allow Afghan security forces to ""defend themselves against any attack"". In extraordinary scenes during Eid al-Fitr, the end of the holy fasting month of Ramadan on Saturday, militants embraced security force members and took selfies with citizens. Both sides had declared a three-day truce for the occasion. Afghans took selfies with the militants in Kabul In his announcement on Saturday, President Ghani appealed to the militants to follow the government's lead and enter peace talks. Celebrating Eid around the world Counting the cost of Trump's air war in Afghanistan During the ceasefire, Taliban militants were able to receive medical and humanitarian assistance and Taliban prisoners could see their families, he added. The government also released some Taliban prisoners, he said. The Taliban announced the three-day halt to hostilities earlier this month, days after a unilateral ceasefire was ordered by the government. It is the Taliban's first ceasefire since the government they ran was toppled by the 2001 US-led invasion. ""It was the most peaceful Eid. For the first time we felt safe. It is hard to describe the joy,"" said Qais Liwal, a student in Zabul in southern Afghanistan. In February Mr Ghani offered peace talks ""without preconditions"" and recognition of the Taliban as a legitimate political group if they respected the rule of law. Tens of thousands of Afghans have been killed since the US-led invasion drove the Taliban from power in 2001.

'Appalling' violence hits cycle festival,"Police attended Tameside Stadium when violence broke out at the cycling festival Police have condemned the ""appalling"" violence at a cycling festival in Greater Manchester that saw nine people hurt and eight men arrested. Thirty protesters stormed the Eritrean event at Curzon Ashton's Tameside Stadium on Saturday, throwing bottles, food and beer kegs. Organisers said frightened young children were put in danger by the violence. It is thought the men were protesting against the Eritrean government. Police escort away two young men after the trouble at Curzon Ashton's ground The Eritrean Cycle Festival was attended by hundreds of people, with singing, dancing and appearances from cyclists who appeared at the 1964 Olympic Games in Tokyo and 1960 Games in Rome. Organiser Goitom Seyoum, 48, said: ""This had nothing to do with politics - this was purely a celebration of Eritrean cycling. ""We had African champions here and people who appeared at the Olympics. ""It was a peaceful protest at first and then they barged in throwing bottles, food and beer kegs. ""It was outrageous - there were children in buggies and people cut and bleeding. ""This was supposed to be a festival but now we leave with a sad feeling. ""Young children were put in danger by these cowards."" Ambulances and police attended the scene at Tameside Stadium Riot officers were deployed by Greater Manchester Police at the stadium in Ashton-under-Lyne. Those arrested were held on suspicion of public order offences. Ch Insp Andy Harty said: ""The vast majority of people attending the event today were innocent people, including children, who sadly got caught in the middle of this appalling act of violence.

Melania Trump wades into child migrant row,"This video can not be played Zero-tolerance: The US policy dividing families and opinion The former US First Lady Laura Bush has condemned a controversial policy that splits up families who illegally enter the country at the Mexican border. Writing in the Washington Post newspaper, she describes the separation of children from their parents as cruel, immoral and heart-breaking. Her comments follow growing controversy over President Donald Trump's ""zero-tolerance"" immigration policy. Earlier Melania Trump made a rare statement expressing concern. Mrs Trump ""hates to see children separated from their families"", her spokeswoman said. Why the US is separating migrant children from their parents Migrant children 'held in cages' in Texas She repeated her husband's call for ""both sides"" to work on immigration reform as a solution. However, fact-checkers point out that the policy was introduced by Mr Trump's attorney general and does not require congressional action to be stopped. In a recentsix-week period there were nearly 2,000 family separationsfollowing a crackdown on illegal border crossings. Adults who try to cross the border outside of official entry points - many planning to seek asylum - are placed in custody and face criminal prosecution for illegal entry. As a result, hundreds of children and babies are now being housed in detention centres, including warehouses and converted supermarkets, and kept away from their parents. Laura Bush, wife of the former Republican President George W Bush and a Texas resident, launched an outspoken attack on the policy. ""This zero-tolerance policy is cruel. It is immoral. And it breaks my heart,""she wrote in the Washington Post,external. ""Our government should not be in the business of warehousing children in converted box stores or making plans to place them in tent cities in the desert."" Laura Bush, left, and Melania Trump have both spoken out about the treatment of child migrants ""These images are eerily reminiscent of theJapanese American internment camps of World War Two,external, now considered to have been one of the most shameful episodes in US history,"" she added. Earlier Mrs Trump said she ""hates to see children separated from their families and hopes both sides of the aisle [Republicans and Democrats in Congress] can finally come together to achieve successful immigration reform"". ""We need to be a country that follows all laws, but also a country that governs with heart,"" her statement added. Ivanka's mother and child photo sparks backlash How Melania compares to other first ladies US attorney general quotes Bible to defend separating families The first ladies' comments come amid growing alarm over the impact of the policy. On Monday, UN human rights chief Zeid Ra'ad al-Hussein called on the US to end what he called its ""unconscionable"" strategy of forced separations. Earlier Department of Homeland Security Secretary Kirstjen Nielsen defended her agency's role at the border, saying: ""We do not have a policy of separating families at the border. Period."" Butshe said authorities would remove children,externalif the parent they were travelling with had broken the law. Mr Trump has said a law ""Democrats gave us"" is responsible for the policy, but it is unclear which law he is referring to. In a tweet on Saturday he urged Democrats to work with Republicans to create new legislation. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

However, critics have pointed out that detaining children separately from their parents is the consequence of a policy announced by Attorney General Jeff Sessions last month to deter new arrivals. The significant change, analysts say, is the justice department's decision to prosecute parents if they illegally cross the border, even if it is their first offence. The children are not charged with a crime, which means they cannot be jailed together. This video can not be played Migrant boys detained in a former Walmart in Texas Until this policy was announced, such families were usually subject to civil deportation proceedings, which did not require separation. The recent child detentions have resulted in some shelters and foster homes reporting that they are running out of space. On Sunday, Democratic lawmakers visited shelters and processing facilities in New Jersey and Texas, demanding to see detainees. ""They call it zero-tolerance, but a better name for it is zero-humanity. And there is zero logic to this,"" Sen Jeff Merkley of Oregon, who organised a visit to Casa Padre detention centre in Brownsville, Texas, told the BBC. ""What we saw is this huge warehouse, it was a super centre for Walmart before, now it's a super detention centre. It's holding almost 1,500 kids inside there."" Vermont congressman Peter Welch said he saw children held ""in chain link cages"" in a processing facility and one shelter ""filled to capacity"". Allow Twitter content?

Meanwhile, officials announced plans to erect tent cities that will hold hundreds more children in the Texas desert where temperatures regularly reach 40C (105F). Local lawmaker Jose Rodriguez described the plan as ""totally inhumane"" and ""outrageous"", adding: ""It should be condemned by anyone who has a moral sense of responsibility."" Protesters marched to one such tent city in Tornillo, Texas, on Sunday where hundreds of children were being held separately from their parents. They chanted ""Families united!"" and ""Free our children now!"",external, reported NPR. The policy faces legal challenges, including a federal case brought by the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU). The number offamilies trying to enter the US overland without documentation,externalis on the rise. In the first two weeks of the new ""zero-tolerance"" approach, 658 minors - including many babies and toddlers - were separated from the adults that travelled with them, according to US border officials. In many of the cases, the families have been reunited after the parent was released from detention. However, there are reports of people being kept apart for weeks and even months. But it is not clear if this new tougher policy will stop the migrants from travelling. This is because many are fleeing violence and poverty in countries such as Honduras and El Salvador, and staying put is often fraught with dangers.

David Dimbleby to leave Question Time,"This video can not be played Some memorable moments from David Dimbleby's tenure as Question Time host David Dimbleby is to leave Question Time after 25 years on the BBC's flagship political programme. The presenter, who will leave the show at the end of the year, said it was ""the right moment"" to go. The 79-year-old, who has chaired the show since 1994, insisted he was ""not giving up broadcasting"" but planned ""to return to my first love: reporting"". BBC director general Tony Hall called him ""a titan in British broadcasting"" and a ""champion of the public"". Dimbleby, who began his broadcasting career more than 57 years ago, is the longest-serving presenter of Question Time. In addition, he has been the BBC's main presenter for all general elections since 1979, as well as the chief commentator for many state occasions including the funeral ofDiana, Princess of Wales, in 1997. In 1975 he presented the BBC's coverage of the first referendum in Europe, a role he repeated in 2016 for the BBC's coverage of the EU referendum. Dimbleby to front last election in 2015 A scorpion tattoo for Dimbleby Dimbleby caught out eating chocolate Speaking about his quarter of a century at the helm of Question Time, he said it had been ""exhilarating following the twists and turns of British politics"". ""It has been a privilege to work for a programme which brings voters face to face with those in power,"" he said. The show has hosted many of Britain's most prominent politicians, as well as contributors as diverse as academic and writer Germaine Greer and BNP leader Nick Griffin. Last year saw him throw out one member of the audience after they repeatedly interrupted panel members during a Question Time edition filmed in Plymouth. He also revealed a less serious side, when it was reported that at the age of 75 he had got his first tattoo, of a scorpion, to represent his star sign. The show has hosted politicians from across the political spectrum, including Labour frontbencher Emily Thornberry Paying tribute, Lord Hall said: ""David has been at the helm of Question Time for over 25 years: a brilliant champion of the public and the audience's friend - getting the answers they want on the big and difficult issues of the day. ""Always a commanding figure, David has ensured Question Time has not only stayed relevant through the years, but a must watch for those interested in politics and current affairs."" Dimbleby's final broadcast on Question Time will be on 13 December 2018 - but there is no word yet on who will replace him. Newsnight presenter Kirsty Wark recently told Good Housekeeping magazine she would be interested in taking over the role and would ""throw her hat in the ring"" when Dimbleby stepped down. Other suggested contenders include her fellow Newsnight presenter Emily Maitlis, Fiona Bruce, John Humphrys and Huw Edwards. Wark has expressed interest in the job Some are calling for the programme to have its first female presenter. Labour MP Liz McInnes sent her best wishes to Dimbleby and spoke of her keenness to see a woman at the helm of the show. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

It is not known how much Dimbleby is paid for his role because Question Time is made by an independent production company, meaning his salary did not appear in last year's list oftop paid BBC stars. Recent reports in the Telegraph speculated that he was paid Â£450,000 per annum by the corporation. Question Time has been on air for nearly 40 years. It was initially chaired by Robin Day (1979-89) and later by Peter Sissons (1989-93).

Government 'could collapse' over Brexit deal,"Dominic Grieve said the government's amendment was ""valueless"" Tory rebels ""could collapse the government"" if they vote against a Brexit deal negotiated with the EU, a leading rebel has said. Dominic Grieve said he wakes up ""in a cold sweat"" thinking about what could happen if a final deal is rejected. But he suggested rebels would not back down in a current row with ministers about how much of a say MPs should get. The EU Withdrawal Bill returns to the Lords and Commons this week, with further rebellions expected. Rebels: Brexit bill offer is a slap in the face PM 'must honour Brexit vote assurances' Last week the government avoided a defeat on the bill after agreeing to hold further talks with rebels. They want a bigger role for Parliament, should a final Brexit deal be rejected by MPs, or if no deal is reached - the so-called ""meaningful vote"". Former Attorney General Mr Grieve told BBC One's Sunday Politics that he thought they had agreed MPs could have an ""advisory"" vote, that would not order the government to do anything, but would help people to ""keep calm"" during what would be a ""critical situation"". But after two days of talks, Mr Grieve said a government amendment drawn up to avert a rebellion was changed at the last minute and was now ""valueless"". He implied rebels would vote against it this week: ""I'm absolutely sure that the group is quite determined that the meaningful vote pledge, which was given to us, has got to be fulfilled."" He added: ""The alternative is that we've all got to sign up to a slavery clause now, saying whatever the government does, when it comes to January, however potentially catastrophic it might be for my constituents and my country, I'm signing in blood now that I will follow over the edge of a cliff, and that I can tell you, I am not prepared to do."" The government's amendment to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill sets out what must happen in the event of three scenarios: If MPs vote down the UK-EU Brexit deal, if Theresa May announces before 21 January 2019 that no deal has been reached, or if 21st January passes with no deal being struck. Under these circumstances, a minister must make a statement in Parliament setting out their next steps and give MPs an opportunity to vote. However, the vote would be on ""a motion in neutral terms"", merely stating that the House has considered the statement. Rebels had originally wanted the amendment to say that the government must seek the approval of Parliament for its course of action - and that ministers must be directed by MPs and peers. When it was put to him that voting against any Brexit deal at ""the 11th hour"" of negotiations could cause the government to collapse, he replied:  ""We could collapse the government and I can assure you, I wake up at 2am in a cold sweat thinking about the problems that we have put on our shoulders."" Last week another Conservative MP, Tom Tugendhat,told Sky News,externalthere was ""going to be a new government"" if MPs rejected the government's Brexit deal. Solicitor General Robert Buckland said that ""however well intentioned"" Mr Grieve's plan had been, his worry was that ""it actually plays badly in the most important negotiation, which is over in Brussels"". It would imply to the EU, he said, that ""there's a third party in this relationship"" - Parliament - which could ""trump whatever the UK government say"". He said ministers would stick with the new amendment for Monday, adding: ""Let's see what the Lords make of it. Of course we have Tuesday to consider matters ahead of the Wednesday vote."" Earlier the prime minister defended her handling of the row. She told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show she had met Tory rebels and ""undertook to consider their concerns"". She admitted there had been ""a debate"" about what a ""meaningful"" vote for Parliament meant: ""I've listened carefully to the concerns, I've put an amendment down which I think balances this issue of the role of Parliament together with the need for us to ensure we don't overturn the decision of the British people."" But she said Parliament ""cannot tie the hands of government in negotiations"". The main purposes of the EU Withdrawal Bill are to end the supremacy of EU law in the UK, and transfer existing EU law into UK law so the same rules and regulations apply on the day after Brexit. But as it passes through Parliament, MPs and peers have been trying to change it, in some cases adding bits on that would change the government's Brexit strategy. The government says the whole row is about a ""hypothetical"" scenario and they are ""confident we will agree a good deal with the EU which Parliament will support"".

'Horse hit' as triathlon cyclists pass,"This video can not be played 'Horse hit' as Windsor Triathlon cyclists passes Triathlon organisers are investigating as a horse was hit and its rider hurt by cyclists racing too close to them. Footage posted on Facebook by the rider showed the moment she said she and her horse were hit during the Windsor Triathlon at about 09:00 BST. The video shows cyclists pass on both sides, the horse react to a jolt, and the rider cry out. Organiser Human Race Events said anyone found responsible would be disqualified from the race. The rider, posting under the name ""Jennifer Katherine"", said both she and the horse were wearing high-visibility garments at the time of the crash. She wrote: ""The cyclist smashes along the side of my horse, taking my stirrup in the handlebars and bruising up my ankle. ""My horse rears and bolts forward, taking off one of his back shoes."" She said she had been unaware the event had been planned. ""No-one stopped to see if I or the horse was OK after this hit,"" she said. ""I'm still in shock and feeling very sore along one side of my ankle."" The Windsor Triathlon has been running for 28 years and competitors start and finish the race near Windsor Castle. Amanda Coyne, who lives near the route of the race, said she had encountered cyclists riding ""dangerously"" while driving shortly before 09:00. ""I nearly had a heart attack as I nearly got hit by a car which had been forced to overtake cyclists who were riding four-abreast,"" she said. ""They were riding at such speeds and didn't care who was coming in front of them and who was behind them and I really worried there was going to be a terrible accident."" She said she stopped to speak to a race official who she said dismissed her fears.

Taliban set to end truce despite pleas,"This video can not be played Tears, hugs and selfies as Afghan troops and Taliban mark a truce for Eid A widely welcomed three-day ceasefire between security forces and the Taliban in Afghanistan appears to be over. The Taliban said its militants had been ordered to take up arms again on Sunday night - now the Eid festival had ended. The government says it will continue a unilateral ceasefire for another 10 days, although security forces can defend themselves if attacked. There were unprecedented scenes of soldiers and Taliban insurgents hugging each other during the ceasefire. But the ceasefire failed to end violence entirely. At least 18 people were killed in a suicide attack in the city of Jalalabad, outside the office of the governor of Nangarhar province while officials were meeting Taliban insurgents. Dozens were injured. No group said it carried out the attack. What's life like under the Taliban? Militants 'threaten 70% of Afghanistan' Who are the Taliban? On Saturday a suicide bombing in the same province, also on a gathering of Taliban and local officials, left 36 people dead. The Islamic State group said it carried out that attack. The militants said there would be no extension to the ceasefire and fighters would be expected to leave government-controlled areas before sunset. A militant hugs a member of the Afghan police in Kunduz In a statement, the Taliban said it had called the ceasefire to enable ordinary Afghans to enjoy a peaceful Eid, ""not in response to the ceasefire of the Kabul regime"". The group hailed the success of the ceasefire as a sign of its cohesion, and reasserted its determination to seek the ""withdrawal of foreign invaders and establishment of an Islamic government"". President Ashraf Ghani's plea on Saturday for the Taliban to prolong its truce has been rejected. His office said on Sunday that the government's extended truce would still allow Afghan security forces to ""defend themselves against any attack"". In extraordinary scenes during Eid al-Fitr, the end of the holy fasting month of Ramadan on Saturday, militants embraced security force members and took selfies with citizens. Both sides had declared a three-day truce for the occasion. Afghans took selfies with the militants in Kabul In his announcement on Saturday, President Ghani appealed to the militants to follow the government's lead and enter peace talks. Celebrating Eid around the world Counting the cost of Trump's air war in Afghanistan During the ceasefire, Taliban militants were able to receive medical and humanitarian assistance and Taliban prisoners could see their families, he added. The government also released some Taliban prisoners, he said. The Taliban announced the three-day halt to hostilities earlier this month, days after a unilateral ceasefire was ordered by the government. It is the Taliban's first ceasefire since the government they ran was toppled by the 2001 US-led invasion. ""It was the most peaceful Eid. For the first time we felt safe. It is hard to describe the joy,"" said Qais Liwal, a student in Zabul in southern Afghanistan. In February Mr Ghani offered peace talks ""without preconditions"" and recognition of the Taliban as a legitimate political group if they respected the rule of law. Tens of thousands of Afghans have been killed since the US-led invasion drove the Taliban from power in 2001.

'Historic' deal signed on Macedonia name,"Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras (right) met Zoran Zaev near the border between the two countries Greece and Macedonia have signed a deal that aims to settle a decades-long dispute over Macedonia's name. Under the agreement, Greece's neighbour will be known as North Macedonia. Greek PM Alexis Tsipras said it was ""a brave, historic and necessary step for our peoples"". Heated rows over Macedonia's name have been going on since the break-up of the former Yugoslavia, of which it was a part, and have held up Macedonia's entry to Nato and the EU. Greece has long argued that by using the name Macedonia, its neighbour was implying it had a claim on the northern Greek province also called Macedonia. Full story: What's the name row about?,external The man who has focused on one word for 23 years,external The two countries' leaders announced the deal on Tuesday and have pressed ahead despite protests. Mr Tsipras and his Macedonian counterpart Zoran Zaev watched as their foreign ministers signed the deal on Lake Prespa on Greece's northern border on Sunday. The agreement still needs to be approved by both parliaments and by a referendum in Macedonia. Nationalists on both sides say it erodes their identity. On Saturday Mr Tsipras survived a no-confidence vote over the deal amid accusations he made too many concessions. By Guy De Launey, BBC Balkans Correspondent It looked like the setting for a wedding. A white marquee erected on the banks of a picturesque lake. And indeed, one of the participants was agreeing to change its name. After almost three decades of dispute, the northern neighbour of Greece should soon become North Macedonia. An elderly man in the audience nodded and smiled. This was Matthew Nimetz - the UN mediator who has spent a quarter of a century trying to find a solution acceptable to both countries. He called the prime and foreign ministers ""four outstanding leaders"" with ""political courage, vision and diplomatic skills"". Under the deal, the country known at the UN as Former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia (Fyrom) would be named Republic of North Macedonia. Its language would be Macedonian and its people known as Macedonians (citizens of the Republic of North Macedonia). As part of the agreement, Greece would lift its objections to the renamed nation joining the EU and Nato. There is still some way to go before the name change becomes official. Protesters chant the Greek national anthem during a demonstration against the agreement on Sunday Macedonia's parliament first needs to back the deal. That would be followed by a referendum in September or October. If voters there support it, the government would have to change the constitution, which is a key Greek demand. Things have been complicated further as Macedonia's President Gjorge Ivanov is refusing to sign the agreement. He has the power to veto the deal - but not indefinitely. The Macedonian president has the power to veto the name deal If he refuses to sign it, it will be sent back to parliament for a second vote. If it passes again, President Ivanov would then be obliged to approve the legislation.

Mum wants to treat epileptic son at home,"This video can not be played Charlotte Caldwell said the medication ordeal had been 'horrific and cruel' The mum of a boy with severe epilepsy who had cannabis oil medication confiscated wants to meet the home secretary to discuss reforming the law. Charlotte Caldwell's son Billy, 12, uses the oil as his anti-seizure medication and she wants to be able to treat him with it at home. The Home Office has granted a limited licence for the drug to be administered to the child in hospital for 20 days. Billy is being treated at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London. Ms Caldwell says her son's seizures dramatically reduce when he takes the oil, which contains a substance called Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) that is illegal in the UK. On Monday Billy's supply - which Ms Caldwell had tried to bring in from Canada -was confiscated at Heathrowairport and he was admitted to hospital after his seizures ""intensified"". Home Secretary Sajid Javid later approved the use of cannabis oil after doctors made clear it was a medical emergency. The situation is under review. Ms Caldwell, from County Tyrone in Northern Ireland, wants to meet Mr Javid to discuss the matter and said: ""I will not stand by and let any other family in our country endure this experience. It's horrific and cruel."" Crispin Blunt MP, co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on drug policy reform, said the existing law was ""frankly absurd"". This video can not be played Take a look inside the world's largest legal cannabis farm in Canada Dr Amir Englund, of the Institute of Psychiatry at King's College London, said an exemption should be made in Billy's case ""so that he does not come to further harm"". But UCL's Dr Michael Bloomfield said the use of medical marijuana is ""far from straightforward"". He said in some jurisdictions the drug's use for medical conditions is ""a potential way of decriminalising cannabis through the back door"". Reality Check: Does UK export the most legal cannabis? The Home Office's initial decision, and then its reversal, prompted calls for drug law reform from MPs on all sides. Billy was admitted to hospital in London on Friday Mr Blunt, a Conservative, said the existing law was based on an ""outdated"" claim that cannabis had no medicinal value. ""We need to get serious now about getting the benefits of these medicines, and move to change the frankly absurd position we are in,"" he said. Ex-Tory health minister Dan Poulter said the current situation was ""ridiculous"" and pledged to push for a change in the law. He said: ""I genuinely don't understand why we see... medicinal cannabis through the prism of the 1971 Misuse of Drugs legislation, when actually this is a medical issue, it's not a prohibition of drugs issue, and that's what's got to change."" In 2017, Billy was prescribed the medication on the NHS but last monthhis GP was told he could no longer prescribe it. At the time the Department of Health in Northern Ireland said cannabis had not yet been licensed in the UK as a medicine. CBD and Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are two types of cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant. A cannabis-based drug called Sativex has been licensed in the UK to treat MS. It contains THC and CBD. Doctors could, in theory, prescribe it for other things outside of this licence, but at their own risk. MS patients prescribed Sativex, who resupply it to other people, also face prosecution. Another licensed treatment is Nabilone. It contains an artificial version of THC and can be given to cancer patients to help relieve nausea during chemotherapy.

"'Historic' deal signed on Macedonia nameGreece's PM hails the agreement to end the decades-long dispute, but it could still fail.Europe","Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras (right) met Zoran Zaev near the border between the two countries Greece and Macedonia have signed a deal that aims to settle a decades-long dispute over Macedonia's name. Under the agreement, Greece's neighbour will be known as North Macedonia. Greek PM Alexis Tsipras said it was ""a brave, historic and necessary step for our peoples"". Heated rows over Macedonia's name have been going on since the break-up of the former Yugoslavia, of which it was a part, and have held up Macedonia's entry to Nato and the EU. Greece has long argued that by using the name Macedonia, its neighbour was implying it had a claim on the northern Greek province also called Macedonia. Full story: What's the name row about?,external The man who has focused on one word for 23 years,external The two countries' leaders announced the deal on Tuesday and have pressed ahead despite protests. Mr Tsipras and his Macedonian counterpart Zoran Zaev watched as their foreign ministers signed the deal on Lake Prespa on Greece's northern border on Sunday. The agreement still needs to be approved by both parliaments and by a referendum in Macedonia. Nationalists on both sides say it erodes their identity. On Saturday Mr Tsipras survived a no-confidence vote over the deal amid accusations he made too many concessions. By Guy De Launey, BBC Balkans Correspondent It looked like the setting for a wedding.

How will social media affect England?,"""You're detached from the outside world. You're out of your comfort zone. You've got to occupy yourself."" That's how Rio Ferdinand describes the England camp at a World Cup. It presents a challenge to the squad - how do they stay focused and motivated for a month without any home comforts or familiarity? Some England players have already hinted what they'll do - and it mostly revolves around playing Fortnite and watching Love Island. But their use of social media is more controversial.

While social media is a good way for the players to stay in touch and pass the time between training sessions, it also opens them up to potential criticism and trolling - which could impact on their performance on the pitch. That's why Rio Ferdinand says it's a ""killer for a tournament"". But how can you ask a bunch of guys in their 20s to stay off Instagram for a month? Ferdinand's fellow BBC sport pundit Frank Lampard says it's an unrealistic ask. And Alex Scott says using social media - in the right way - can even be a positive thing. Allow Twitter content?

His advice would be to remember that ""a lot of talk will have no relation to how to personally prepare for games and perform - so take things with a pinch of salt if need be"".

The differing opinions in the England Women's World Cup camp - and among the BBC pundits - suggests there isn't one hard and fast way that players should approach social media at a tournament. It's a question more and more sports psychologists are asking: does using social media help or hinder performance on the pitch? Tim Pitt, a sports psychologist at the English Institute of Sport, says it's an important question for sportspeople to think about before a major competition. ""Having a routine around tournaments is what athletes use to create familiarity when they go away,"" adds Tim. But, like all sports psychology, there's no blanket rule on what works and what doesn't. Tim Pitt works with Olympic and Paralympic athletes In the end, it comes down to the individual player. ""However you manage it, it's about proactively knowing how to use it so it's useful for you. ""Useful could mean coming off it completely. ""Useful could also be knowing how to engage with it, how to connect with fans and how to use it to keep you busy during downtime."" Newsbeat's at the World Cup in Russia this summer.

Afghan Taliban operations 'to resume',"This video can not be played Tears, hugs and selfies as Afghan troops and Taliban mark a truce for Eid A widely welcomed three-day ceasefire between security forces and the Taliban in Afghanistan appears to be over. The Taliban said its militants had been ordered to take up arms again on Sunday night - now the Eid festival had ended. The government says it will continue a unilateral ceasefire for another 10 days, although security forces can defend themselves if attacked. There were unprecedented scenes of soldiers and Taliban insurgents hugging each other during the ceasefire. But the ceasefire failed to end violence entirely. At least 18 people were killed in a suicide attack in the city of Jalalabad, outside the office of the governor of Nangarhar province while officials were meeting Taliban insurgents. Dozens were injured. No group said it carried out the attack. What's life like under the Taliban? Militants 'threaten 70% of Afghanistan' Who are the Taliban? On Saturday a suicide bombing in the same province, also on a gathering of Taliban and local officials, left 36 people dead. The Islamic State group said it carried out that attack. The militants said there would be no extension to the ceasefire and fighters would be expected to leave government-controlled areas before sunset. A militant hugs a member of the Afghan police in Kunduz In a statement, the Taliban said it had called the ceasefire to enable ordinary Afghans to enjoy a peaceful Eid, ""not in response to the ceasefire of the Kabul regime"". The group hailed the success of the ceasefire as a sign of its cohesion, and reasserted its determination to seek the ""withdrawal of foreign invaders and establishment of an Islamic government"". President Ashraf Ghani's plea on Saturday for the Taliban to prolong its truce has been rejected. His office said on Sunday that the government's extended truce would still allow Afghan security forces to ""defend themselves against any attack"". In extraordinary scenes during Eid al-Fitr, the end of the holy fasting month of Ramadan on Saturday, militants embraced security force members and took selfies with citizens. Both sides had declared a three-day truce for the occasion. Afghans took selfies with the militants in Kabul In his announcement on Saturday, President Ghani appealed to the militants to follow the government's lead and enter peace talks. Celebrating Eid around the world Counting the cost of Trump's air war in Afghanistan During the ceasefire, Taliban militants were able to receive medical and humanitarian assistance and Taliban prisoners could see their families, he added. The government also released some Taliban prisoners, he said. The Taliban announced the three-day halt to hostilities earlier this month, days after a unilateral ceasefire was ordered by the government. It is the Taliban's first ceasefire since the government they ran was toppled by the 2001 US-led invasion. ""It was the most peaceful Eid. For the first time we felt safe. It is hard to describe the joy,"" said Qais Liwal, a student in Zabul in southern Afghanistan. In February Mr Ghani offered peace talks ""without preconditions"" and recognition of the Taliban as a legitimate political group if they respected the rule of law. Tens of thousands of Afghans have been killed since the US-led invasion drove the Taliban from power in 2001.

Car park service for fire-ravaged church,"Around 95 firefighters and officers fought the blaze at its peak The pastor of a 130-year-old church urged people to ""stand up and be strong"" at a service held at a car park after the building was gutted by fire. Grade-II listed Bethel Community Church in Stow Hill in Newport was destroyed after a blaze spread from a derelict nightclub next door on Friday. Andrew Cleverly said: ""Our building may be gone, but the church is alive."" A 43-year-old man and a woman, aged 36, arrested on suspicion of arson were released pending further inquiries. Pastor Andrew Cleverly called for the community to ""stand up and be strong"" after the fire An investigation into the cause of the fire is still continuing. No-one is thought to have been hurt but a cordon remains in Stow Hill. About 40 people were evacuated from neighbouring properties after the fire, but some have since returned home. On Sunday morning about 250 people attended an outdoor service close to the charred remains of the building. Worshippers said prayers and sang songs as Mr Cleverly asked the congregation to ""pray for the future of this church"" and for the community to ""stand up and be strong"". This video can not be played Songs were sung by the 250-strong congregation in the car park Mayor Malcolm Linton and council leader Debbie Wilcox attended and offered the authority's ""continuing support in helping the church to recover from this devastating fire"". Ms Wilcox said ""practical steps need to be taken"" to support the church in ""the short and medium term"". ""Our staff teams have been working in close partnership with the fire and police teams since Friday evening."" Since the fire, it has emerged concerns about the state of the former nightclub, which closed in 2010, had been raised with officials days before the blaze. About 250 worshippers held their Sunday service in the car park Newport Conservatives said it had emailed the city council on 7 June calling for the former Zanzibar and Heights 2000 club to be inspected due to ""fear this could collapse or end up going up in flames"". The complaints came following an online video showing people walking around the derelict building, which was full of debris and loose wires. Newport council said it would be inappropriate to comment. Stow Hill remains closed to vehicles and pedestrians between School Lane and Havelock Street, meaning some bus services through the city centre are being rerouted. In the meantime, fire officials have thanked a fish and chip shop that gave free food and drink to more than 100 emergency service workers called out to the incident. Clive Walker, owner of Teppett & Walkers fish and chips, worked throughout the night.

Another Italian ship, the Orione, docked later with the rest of the migrants. The migrants spent 20 hours in overcrowded rubber dinghies before being rescued by the Aquarius. They have since spent a week in rough seas - with many suffering seasickness. ""The weather was very bad unfortunately, and the sea was rough,"" Sophie Beau of aid organisation SOS MÃ©diterranÃ©e told the BBC. ""So people are in a bad state..., and they are really relieved to come on safe land at the moment."" They come from 26 countries. Reports say the largest groups (about 150 each) are from Sudan and Nigeria, with dozens more from Eritrea, South Sudan and Algeria. Most of the rest of the 630 are from other African countries but a handful are from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Officials say the rescued migrants include 123 unaccompanied minors, 11 younger children under the age of 13 and seven pregnant women. Initially, the migrants will receive food and hygiene kits and everything else necessary to make them comfortable after weeks of hardship, Red Cross official Pedro Redon told the BBC. The pregnant women will be taken for check-ups. Everyone on board will receive psychological help and the Spanish government has promised them medical assistance. Police will have to identify them and take them to police stations to initiate immigration procedures. French President Emmanuel Macron's government will work with Spain to deal with the migrants. Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo said that any migrants who wish to go to France would be allowed to do, providing they had a legitimate claim to asylum. The Aquarius sparked a major diplomatic row when it was left stranded on Monday. Italy's populist coalition,external- and in particular its interior minister, the right-wing League party leader Matteo Salvini - has taken a hard-line approach to immigration and refused to let it dock. Mr Salvini says it is unfair that countries on the frontline of the EU have had to carry most of the burden of handling the migrant influx. He said Malta should accept the Aquarius, but it refused, arguing that it fell under Italian jurisdiction. Valencia's Mayor Joan Ribo, who has offered the ship a safe berth, described Italy's decision to turn the vessel away as inhuman. This video can not be played On board the Aquarius, people rest in cramped conditions He told the BBC that he hoped the city's actions would act as an ""electric shock"" and lead to reform of Europe's migration policies. Earlier, Mr Macron accused Italy of ""irresponsibility"" for turning the Aquarius away. Migration reform is likely to be a key topic at a meeting of EU leaders later this month, as many countries continue to grapple with the political fallout caused by an influx of migrants in recent years.

Home secretary: I was moped mugger victim,"Home Secretary Sajid Javid has revealed he was a victim of a moped mugging in north London. In a Sun on Sunday interview,external, Mr Javid said he reached for his phone to call a taxi outside Euston station when the thieves rode on to the pavement. They grabbed his phone and zoomed off, he said, which left him ""angry and upset"". He said he is now working on a review to give police more power to pursue moped thieves. ""Before I knew what was happening, it (the phone) had gone,"" said Mr Javid, who was appointed home secretary in April, becoming responsible for the UK's policing and security. Speaking of the incident, which happened a couple of years ago, he said: ""I was angry and upset but thought myself lucky not to have been stabbed or beaten up like many other victims who fall prey to these vicious criminals."" His revelation comes days after comedian Michael McIntyrewas robbed by men on a moped in north-west London. This video can not be played Stories of moped crime from victims and police Home Office proposals announced last month aim to give police drivers more legal protection and aim to smash the ""myth"" that officers cannot pursue riders who are not wearing helmets.

Glasgow art school fire operation continues,"The art school building has been devastated by the fire The fire-ravaged structure of the Glasgow School of Art may have to be demolished, a leading construction expert has warned. Billy Hare, a professor of construction management, said there was a ""growing consensus"" the globally-significant building may have to be pulled down. It came as fire crews spent a second day working to extinguish the blaze, which also damaged the O2 ABC venue. Art school staff have seen the damaged Mackintosh building for the first time. They were able to see what remains of the historic shell from the college's adjoining buildings. Muriel Grey, the chairwoman of the board of the governors, said: ""It is an understatement to say everyone is utterly devastated."" Fire chiefs said the fire had largely been contained and thermal imaging cameras were being used to identify any remaining hotspots. Prof Hare, deputy director of The Beam Research Centre at Glasgow Caledonian University, warned that the building could be structurally unsound. This video can not be played Aerial footage shows scale of the Glasgow School of Art fire He compared the intensity of the blaze with a fire which started in the roof of a building housing Victoria's nightclub in nearby Sauchiehall Street in March. Within days of that fire,Glasgow City Council confirmed it would demolish the building. Prof Hare told BBC Scotland:  ""At that stage the decision was taken fairly quickly to demolish that building. ""However, the Mack being such a globally-recognised building of significance, this would probably have a bit more deliberation before they come to that decision. ""But the consensus is beginning to grow over the last 24 hours that that might very well be the case."" How Glasgow earned its reputation as the 'Tinderbox City' Timeline: The art school's devastating years 'I assumed it was a social media blip' The world's love of Glasgow School of Art He said if it was not possible to retain the facade of the building, it may be possible to take down the building brick-by-brick and rebuild with a new internal frame. A painstaking project such as that could cost in excess of Â£100m, he warned. As it was: the art school building was under reconstruction from the first fire in 2014 After the fire: the art school and a neighbouring building have been devastated, Friday night's blaze was the second to hit the Charles Rennie Mackintosh-designed building in four years. It was undergoing an extensive restoration, costing up to Â£35m, while staff and students worked in neighbouring buildings on the campus. The Mackintosh building was under the day-to-day control of Kier Construction. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon described the damage from the latest fire as ""heartbreaking"". Miles Glendinning, a professor of architectural conservation, told BBC Radio Scotland that the building ""should be restored and will be restored"". He said ""remarkable"" record-keeping during the restoration process following the 2014 fire meant the art school still exists in digital form. Speaking to Good Morning Scotland, he said: ""A Glasgow School of Art project team [made] a digital recording reconstruction of the whole building, not just the bit that was affected before, down to the nearest millimetre, outside and in, using photos and measured drawings. ""So the building still exists digitally even if the inside is for the moment physically absent."" He said he would be ""very surprised"" if the building had to be knocked down and rebuilt, saying the walls could instead be reinforced. In a statement released by Glasgow School of Art on Sunday evening, Muriel Gray said they had a ""difficult waiting game"" while investigations were carried out into the condition of the building. ""We remain hopeful of as positive an outcome as possible because it is clear that the love for the Mackintosh and recognition of its importance to Glasgow and the wider world is shared by absolutely everyone,"" she added. The art school's director Prof Tom Inns said its priority was to continue to operate the school with minimum disruption to staff and students. Meanwhile, Scottish Secretary David Mundell ruled out a public inquiry into the blaze ""unless someone can bring forward some exceptional reason"". He said various investigations would be held into the cause of the fire - as with any other similar incident. Scottish Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop was also asked about the possibility of a public inquiry on BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland. She said: ""I understand people want a lot of questions answered but clearly we have to have the fire investigation first and we have to give them the time to carry out their very responsible duties to best effect."" The fire could be seen throughout Glasgow city centre Firefighters continue to damp down the fire at the Mackintosh building and the O2 ABC music venue Labour MP Paul Sweeney, who visited the site on Saturday night,shared several videos on Twitter,externalshowing the damaged building from different angles. He described part of the 1909 library extension as a ""tangled mess of charred timber and distorted steel joists"" - but added that some structural joists and outer walls appear to be solid and stable. He said the eastern wing, which dates from 1899, appears to have been hit worse - with some of the stone ""baked"", fractured or ""visibly moved"" by the heat. The neighbouring O2 ABC collapsed and glass panels on a building opposite shattered from the high temperature, Mr Sweeney added. Allow Twitter content?

The Glasgow North East MP raised concerns about the role of the contractor, Kier Construction. ""I have to say it's extremely worrying that within the space of four years, this could happen again,"" he said. ""Questions have to be raised about the contractor and how the contractor who had responsibility for the site has managed that site if the security had been sufficient, and so on."" Kier Construction said it was devastated by the fire and was working closely with the fire service in their investigation. No-one was injured by the fire, which was reported at about 23:20 on Friday. At the height of the blaze, a total of 120 firefighters and 20 fire engines were at the scene and nearby homes were evacuated as a precaution. Hoses brought water from the River Clyde to help fight the flames. A total of 50 firefighters, six fire engines and two high-reach appliances remained at the scene on Sunday. The fire service said it was too early to speculate on the cause, adding that forensic experts would not be able to gain access to the building until it had been made safe. Group Manager Martin Hill said: ""This has clearly been a protracted incident and today we are still very much in a firefighting phase. ""Our firefighters have been working effectively throughout the night and we are continuing to dampen down any remaining pockets of fire. ""We will remain on the scene for as long as it takes - we are absolutely committed to preventing any further damage to surrounding properties and ensuring the area is made safe."" The fire ripped through the newly-restored building on Friday night Chief officer Alasdair Hay would not be drawn on whether the building would have to be pulled down over safety fears. He said the fire service was working with structural engineers and Glasgow City Council's building control department during the operation. ""This is a heartbreaking incident and if we could take any solace from it, there has been no injuries,"" he told the BBC News Channel. ""And what we want to absolutely avoid at this stage is for anyone to get injured, so we are being very cautious."" Sturgeon says blaze is 'heartbreaking' The story of the fire and its aftermath Scotland reacts to Glasgow art school fire First Minister Nicola Sturgeon visited the site on Saturday. She said: ""The fire has been a devastating blaze, much worse than the one that took hold of the Mackintosh building four years ago. ""The damage is severe and extensive. My heart goes out to everybody associated with the art school."" Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish government stood ""ready to provide any support"" in the wake of the blaze. Prime Minister Theresa May said the UK government would support the Scottish government in restoration efforts. The A-listed building, considered to be Charles Rennie Mackintosh's masterpiece, wasbadly damaged in a blaze in May 2014. The Mackintosh building was completed in 1909 based on designs by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Scotland's most-lauded designer. Glasgow School of Art has produced a number of leading contemporary artists, including Douglas Gordon, Alison Watt, David Shrigley, and  recent Turner Prize winners Simon Starling, Richard Wright and Martin Boyce.

Christopher Chope supports upskirting ban,"The Conservative MP who blocked a bill that would have made ""upskirting"" a criminal offence has said he ""wholeheartedly"" supports such a law. Had the law passed, someone secretly taking a photo up a woman's skirt could have faced up to two years in prison. Speaking to his local paper, the Bournemouth Echo,external, Sir Christopher Chope said he was objecting to parliamentary procedure rather than the law itself. The Christchurch MP said he was not ""a dinosaur"" and was being ""scapegoated"". Prime Minister Theresa May said she was ""disappointed"" that one of her own MPs had prevented the bill from progressing.

I was a victim of 'upskirting' - but I'm fighting back Speaker calls for private members' bills rethink May 'disappointed' at upskirting law block Sir Christopher said upskirting was ""vulgar, humiliating and unacceptable"" and said accusations he was ""some kind of pervert"" were ""a complete travesty of the truth"". ""It's defamatory of my character and it's very depressing some of my colleagues have been perpetuating that in the past 48 hours,"" he added. This video can not be played Hear MPs shout ""shame"" after Sir Christopher objects to the bill He explained that he stopped the bill from progressing because he disapproved of how the legislation was being brought in. ""The government has been hijacking time that is rightfully that of backbenchers,"" he said. ""This is about who controls the House of Commons on Fridays and that's where I am coming from."" He accused the government of trying to ""bring in what it wants on the nod"", adding: ""We don't quite live in the Putin era yet."" The bill was expected to sail through the Commons on Friday, but parliamentary rules mean it only required one MP to shout ""object"" to block its progress. Sir Christopher's intervention was met with shouts of ""shame"" from other MPs. His actions were attacked by MPs - many from his own party.

There is no law specifically naming and banning upskirting in England and Wales - victims and police are currently only able to pursue offences of outraging public decency or as a crime of voyeurism Upskirting has been an offence in Scotland since 2010 when it was listed under the broadened definition of voyeurism What are the limitations of the current situation in England and Wales? Voyeurism only applies to filming actions taking place in private Outraging public decency usually requires someone to have witnessed the action but upskirting is often unobserved Unlike other sexual offences, people don't have an automatic right to anonymity What does the new law propose?

Moscow crash driver 'feared mob lynching',"This video can not be played This video has been removed for rights reasons The Moscow taxi driver who ploughed into pedestrians says he fled because he feared the crowd would kill him. Footage shows people chasing and then kicking him after Saturday's crash in which at least seven people - including Mexican World Cup fans - were injured. The man says he had been at the wheel for 20 hours, and mistakenly pressed the accelerator instead of the brake. Detained at the scene, he has been identified by police as a 28-year-old national of Kyrgyzstan. A criminal investigation is now under way. CCTV footage published in Russian media shows the taxi veer out of a queue of stationary traffic and accelerate into pedestrians before coming to a halt. The car came to a halt after hitting a road sign The driver then tries to run away - but is quickly caught by several passers-by. The incident happened on the Ilyinka street near the Red Square - right in the heart of Moscow. Police later released a video of the suspect being questioned about the crash. ""I wanted to brake, I wanted to let someone through,"" he says, visibly upset. ""I switched off for a second and hit the accelerator.... then I saw the people."" He says he fled because he thought the crowd of people ""were going to kill"" him. ""There were so many of them,"" he adds. He says he had about two hours of sleep before driving for 20 hours. The suspect, who says he is a teetotaller, says the crash was accidental. But one witness, who was across the road at the time of the crash, questioned this. ""I have the feeling that he did it deliberately because he was in the traffic jam with the cars going really slowly,"" said Viktoria Geranovich. ""How could he lose control of the wheel, push the gas and drive into the crowds?"" She said ""mostly girls"" were knocked down, but people rushed to help and the ambulance arrived quickly. ""Thank god everything went well. It's scary that this happened in the very centre.""

"Man, 75, missing after family beach walk","The man went missing while walking along Brancaster beach towards Titchwell A 75-year-old man who went missing on a beach walk with family has been rescued from water nearly 24 hours later. The man, who has yet to be identified, sparked a major search after he was last seen at about 17:10 BST on Saturday on Brancaster beach, Norfolk. He was found in water by a police drone at nearby Titchwell Marshes at 14:36 BST and teams managed to pull him out about an hour-and-a-half later. His condition is unknown but he was taken to hospital for treatment. Insp Lou Provart, from Norfolk Police, said: ""He was found in water so we can only assume he has been there for some time. ""We are delighted to have found and located the gentleman and he is now receiving the appropriate treatment with our colleagues in the ambulance service and will be going to hospital."" The search for the man, who had been heading in the direction of Titchwell when he went missing, involved police, HM Coastguard and a lifeboat from Wells. Insp Provart praised the ""positive"" use of the new drone technology but said the ""inaccessibility"" of where the man was found it made it difficult to rescue him. With the help of the Lowland Search and Rescue he was rescued at 15:58 BST.

NHS 'dangerously' short of staff,"The NHS in England has nearly 100,000 jobs unfilled, a situation described as ""dangerously"" understaffed. The total represents one in 12 of all the posts in the health service and would be enough to staff 10 large hospitals. It includes 35,000 nurse posts and nearly 10,000 doctor vacancies. The figures have been revealed in a finance report, showing NHS services are heading for a Â£931m deficit this year, twice what was planned. Analysis: 10 charts illustrating NHS woes The overspend by hospitals, mental health trusts and ambulance services has been partly blamed on the need to cover the vacancies with overtime and temporary staff. The accounts to the end of December also show higher than expected spending on paying the private sector to see NHS patients in an attempt to relieve the pressure on hard-pressed A&E units. Despite the overspend, the forecast is still some way short of the record Â£2.45bn deficit accrued in 2015-16.

Nigel Edwards of the Nuffield Trust think tank said the NHS was ""dangerously"" short of staff. ""In some ways, the lack of crucial workers in the NHS is an even bigger problem than the lack of funding. ""We can sign a cheque and bring back more money on-stream if the will is there, but there is no button to push which will suddenly bring us tens of thousands of qualified extra staff."" Royal College of Nursing general secretary Janet Davies added: ""All the evidence shows that standards of patient care rise and fall as nurse numbers do. ""That was the lesson from Mid Staffordshire and we cannot afford to forget it."" Ian Dalton, head of NHS Improvement, the regulator that released the accounts, said the health service was working hard to tackle the problems. He said staff deserved ""heartfelt thanks"" for their hard work. A Department of Health and Social Care spokesman said: ""We are supporting staff to improve work/life balance by working more flexibly and have announced the biggest ever expansion of training places for both doctors and nurses.""

Why the NHS is in trouble,"This month hospitals have reported huge pressures, with A&Es over-crowded, a lack of beds and queues of ambulances stacked up outside unable to hand over their patients. It was a similar story last winter. The NHS, it seems, is always facing unrelenting pressure. But why is this when funding is rising? The sheer scale of the health service can take the breath away. Every 24 hours it sees one million patients, and with 1.7 million staff it's the fifth biggest employer in the world. So it should come as no surprise that this vast enterprise absorbs eye-watering amounts of money. Last year in excess of Â£140bn was spent on health across the UK - more than 10 times the figure that was ploughed in 60 years ago. And that's after you adjust it for inflation. Governments over the years have had to invest more and more of the public purse into it. Today 30p out of every Â£1 spent on services goes on health. Even during years of deep austerity in the UK, extra money has been found for the health service - Â£8bn more this parliament in England alone. Yet it seems no matter how much is invested, it's still not enough. The NHS is creaking at the seams. The best barometer of this is the four-hour A&E target. We often think of it as an indication of how good an emergency department is. But it's not. It doesn't tell you about the quality of care - how quickly you get pain relief or whether the unit is good at spotting the signs of a heart attack. Instead it's a sign of whether the system is under stress - both in the community and in the hospital. Which local services are under threat? Upfront charges for foreign patients When there's perfect harmony between the numbers arriving and leaving, 95% of patients will be dealt with in four hours. But this isn't happening. You have to go back to the summer of 2015 for the last time it was met in England, with performance deteriorating markedly year on year. The rest of the UK is not immune either. Four-hour performance is worse in Wales and Northern Ireland. Scotland is performing a little better, but is still some way short of the target - its major hospitals have been hovering below the 90% mark in recent weeks. The ageing population is certainly a major factor - and it's one that all health systems in the world are struggling with. Medical advances have meant that people are living longer. When the NHS was created, life expectancy was 13 years shorter than it is now. This is something to celebrate. Infectious diseases are no longer a significant threat. Heart attacks do not claim the lives of people early in the same numbers. Even cancer is not the death sentence it once was - half of people now survive for a decade or more. But this progress has come at a cost. People are living with a growing number of long-term chronic conditions - diabetes, heart disease and dementia. These are more about care than cure - what patients usually need is support. By the age of 65, most people will have at least one of these illnesses. By 75 they will have two. The average 65-year-old costs the NHS 2.5 times more than the average 30-year-old. An 85-year-old costs more than five times as much. As the numbers continue to rise so does the cost to the NHS. This is compounded by the rising cost of new drugs. The health service is currently considering capping the amount it will pay for new drugs at Â£20m each a year. A fifth of new treatments coming on stream cost more than this. Then there's obesity. A third of adults are so overweight they are risking their health significantly. All this contributes to what health economists call health inflation - the idea that the cost of providing care outstrips the normal rise in the cost of living across the economy. This is why health has tended to get more generous rises than other areas of government spending. Over the years this has been achievable through a combination of economic growth, which brings in more money through tax, and reducing spending in areas such as defence, which has led to the NHS taking an ever-greater share of the public purse. But, of course, the economy goes through cycles and over the years governments have varied the amount they were willing or able to give. Since the NHS was created in 1948, the average annual rise has been just over 4%. During the Labour years under Blair and Brown this was considerably higher. As you can see the period between 2010 and 2015 saw the tightest financial settlement. The following two years were a little more generous, but that average is likely to drop a little over the rest of the parliament under current spending plans. So ministers in England are right to say they are increasing funding - it's been frozen in Wales and Scotland - but it's just that it doesn't compare favourably with what the NHS has traditionally got. Indeed, the Institute for Fiscal Studies has suggested that over the 10 years to 2020, the NHS budget across the UK will not have increased enough to keep pace with the ageing and growing population. But is it just a matter of more money? Would an extra few billion make all the problems go away? If you look at other European nations the UK is certainly spending less as a proportion of GDP, which is a measure of the size of the economy. The result, as you would expect, is fewer beds, doctors and nurses per patient in the UK than the big spenders. But a number of these countries achieve that by taxing more. Would the UK public stomach that? If a poll by Ipsos MORI for the BBC last year is anything to go by, they are pretty split - 40% would back a rise in income tax and 53% would support National Insurance going up. Nor does it seem there's appetite for a change in the system. A majority were against charging for services or moving to an insurance-based model like some of our European neighbours do. But even if more money was spent or raised, that would not lead to an overnight improvement. More doctors and nurses would need training and that takes time and, crucially, there is not a flood of people wanting to work in key posts. Trainee posts for GPs are being increased, but the NHS cannot fill them all. There also remain big questions over whether the structure of the NHS is right for 21st Century healthcare. The NHS is still centred on the network of district general hospitals that emerged during the hospital building boom of the 1960s. But in an era where people are struggling with those chronic illnesses, what they really need is support in the community. The problem is there's a serious shortage of this. The number of district nurses in England has been cut by 28% in the past five years, while getting a GP appointment is becoming increasingly difficult. The result is that people end up going to hospital. The numbers visiting A&E have risen by over 40% in 13 years. Not all of this is down to people with these chronic conditions, but they tend to be the cases that take the most care. Two-thirds of hospitals beds are occupied by the one-third of the population with a long-term condition. There are attempts to change this by placing more emphasis on care outside hospital. NHS England chief executive Simon Stevens has set out a five-year plan to create more integrated care, which involves hospital services working more closely with their local community teams. Similar moves are being made in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland. There also an emphasis on prevention - getting people to be more active, eat better diets and drink less. But perhaps the biggest problem is council-run social care. This encompasses day centres, help in the home for tasks such as washing and dressing, and good quality care in care homes during the final years of life. It is seen as essential to keep people well and living independently - and out of hospital. In an era when the population is ageing you would expect more people to be getting help from the state. However, the opposite is true. In England over the past four years for which we have data, the number of older people getting help has fallen by a quarter. The result is large numbers going without care or having to pay for it themselves. The other parts of the UK can make a case for being more generous in this respect - home care is capped at Â£70 a week in Wales and free for the over-75s in Northern Ireland, while Scotland provides free personal care (washing and dressing) in both care homes and people's own homes. Ministers in England have promised the system will change. New plans are due to be published by the summer of 2018. But, as yet, no part of the UK has cracked it. Indeed, if you were setting up a health and care service today, ask yourself this - how would it be done? Would you separate medical care from personal care? Give one service to a national institution and the other to local councils?  Would you provide one free at the point of need and charge for the other? Would you increase the budget of one, but cut the other? Would you build more than 200 hospitals and spend over half of your budget on them when the biggest users of care are people with long-term illnesses that need care rather than medical intervention? But as that is the system we have got at a time when money is limited, we are falling back on a typical British trait - making do.

Tax rise 'to prevent NHS misery',"Taxes are going to have to rise to pay for the NHS if the UK is to avoid ""a decade of misery"" in which the old, sick and vulnerable are let down, say experts. The Institute for Fiscal Studies and Health Foundation said the NHS would need an extra 4% a year - or Â£2,000 per UK household - for the next 15 years. It said the only realistic way this could be paid for was by tax rises. It comes as ministers are arguing behind the scenes about NHS funding. NHS at 70: Share your memories and stories Why the Treasury is no fan of a ring-fenced 'NHS tax' NHS 'dangerously' short of 100,000 staff May backs long-term funding plan for NHS Pay rise agreed for 1.3 million NHS staff Join our Facebook group on the NHS and share your views.,external The prime minister has promised a long-term funding plan for the NHS. This is expected to cover the next decade and could be announced as soon as next month, in time for the 70th anniversary of the creation of the NHS. It has been announced that an 'NHS assembly' will be set up where national and local stakeholders can discuss progress on achieving plans for the NHS's future. The Treasury is believed to want to keep average rises at about 2% a year, but other ministers are arguing for more, the BBC understands. Health and Social Care Secretary Jeremy Hunt is believed to want at least 3% a year.

As those discussions continue, the IFS and Health Foundation have revealed the findings of their review, commissioned by the NHS Confederation, which represents NHS trusts. It warned the ageing population and rising number of people with long-term conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease, meant the health service needed more than it had been getting in the past decade. In recent years the annual rises once inflation is taken into account have been limited to just over 2%. But continuing in this vein would lead to a continued deterioration in performance, the report warned. Instead, it said, 5% extra was needed in the next five years, and then just under 4% for the following decade if it was going to improve. That would work out at an average of 4% a year over the period, while 3.3% would simply maintain services. On top of that, extra money would also be needed to fund council-run social care for the elderly. That would mean spending as a proportion of national income rising from 8.4% currently to 11.4%. By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor Theresa May is grappling with ministers over NHS funding There's no coincidence at all that the independent number crunchers, the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Health Foundation, have come forward with calls for significantly more cash for NHS England today. It matters right now because behind closed doors in Whitehall, the Department of Health, Downing Street and the Treasury are grappling to agree, not just how much the NHS really needs, but also what the government can really afford. Any eventual long term settlement involves extra billions of taxpayers' money - but if the government falls short, there's a heavy potential cost. What to do next is an intensely political choice. Read more of Laura's blog here. The report said it was ""hard to imagine"" raising that sort of money without increases in taxes. NHS Confederation chief executive Niall Dickson urged ministers not to rush into a quick fix, but warned any attempts to limit rises to 2% would backfire and lead to a ""decade of misery"". ""It is now undeniable that the current system and funding levels are not sustainable,"" he said. The Department of Health and Social Care said plans were being put in place to agree a multi-year settlement. The extra Â£2,000 in tax per household seems an eye-watering amount. But there is some context. That is the amount that would be needed by 2033 - and the economists were quick to point out that this has to be seen in the context that households will become richer. The forecast is that household wealth will rise by over Â£8,000 a year. So paying for the NHS would gobble up just under a quarter of that. Add in social care and it will be over a quarter. To increase tax income by that amount, it would require rises of 3p in the pound on each of income tax, VAT and National Insurance. Although the report said other options, including taxes on property and businesses, could be explored too. Even so, that would leave the UK as a relatively low-tax country. In terms of what that buys in the health service, Â£2,000 does not go very far. It will pay for a month of a staff nurse's salary, or cover 16 visits to A&E or eight ambulance journeys to hospital.

How much does the NHS need?,"There is now a consensus that the NHS needs more money. The prime minister has acknowledged that and called for a new long-term funding plan. But how much?  That is the really tricky question facing the government as it tries to meet expectations. An authoritative report has come up with a first stab at an estimate of what will be required in England over the next decade and beyond. NHS needs 'Â£50bn extra by 2030' Primary school mental health counselling may help economy, study says And the fact it comes from experts from the two main parties at Westminster gives its findings added weight. Lord Darzi, an eminent surgeon, was a Labour Health Minister under Gordon Brown and Lord Prior, who now chairs a hospital trust, served as a Conservative Health Minister in Jeremy Hunt's department. Thereport,external, produced by the think thank the Institute for Public Policy Research, is being read at the highest levels of government. Lord Prior's involvement means it cannot be ignored by Downing Street. And Lord Darzi's admirers include Jeremy Hunt. They have certainly come up with some big numbers - an extra Â£50bn a year above inflation needed for the NHS by 2030 and Â£25bn a year more in productivity savings. This is equivalent to a real-terms increase of 3.5% per year over the next decade. Social care, say the authors, will need Â£10bn more a year by 2030 just to maintain current levels of care. These are figures for England - if adopted by the government at Westminster, they automatically generate increases for Scotland and Wales under the usual formula. They have come up with these figures after modelling the expected increase in demand for patient care. Demographics are among the key factors, with a 33% predicted rise in the number of people over the age of 65 by 2030. Increasing numbers of elderly patients with multiple long-term conditions will need to be looked after across the health service. Aseparate report by the King's Fund,externalthink tank has highlighted another cost pressure, namely the pharmaceuticals budget. This shows that total NHS spending on medicines in England has been growing at about 5% per year since 2010, well ahead of annual health service funding allocations. The report notes that this reflects a higher number of people receiving care and a wider range of treatments available. So where will the money come from? Although they do not say so explicitly, Lord Darzi and Lord Prior are suggesting it will have to come from higher taxation. Lord Darzi says taxes must rise Raising Â£50bn implies increases of 7p in the pound on income tax or National Insurance or a mixture of both. The other option is higher borrowing, though that may be hard to accommodate in current public finance policy. A second report later this year will spell out more clearly how the revenue might be raised. This is difficult territory for the government. On the one hand, ministers have promised a long-term funding plan for the NHS and will want to come up with credible figures. But on the other, they will be loath to get pulled into commitments on taxation well ahead of a general election. Jeremy Hunt will want to ensure there is a realistic stream of funding inked into the strategy - but he knows the Chancellor, Philip Hammond, will have firm views on tax-and-spend policy. Prevention and early intervention will be elements of the new plan. A report from Pro Bono Economicsillustrates one example,external. It found that mental-health counselling in primary schools, provided by the charity Place2B, could generate significant economic benefits by improving outcomes for children. Reducing smoking and depression in later years will save money for the NHS. In other words, spending now on prevention will reap bigger savings in the longer term. Lord Darzi and Lord Prior believe the NHS is sustainable and a taxpayer-funded system is more effective than insurance-based models, which are more costly to administer. But they say reforms and new thinking are required and, crucially, a significant increase in funding. That amounts to a gauntlet being thrown down at the door of Number 10.

Rose one back amid Mickelson controversyEngland's Justin Rose is one shot adrift of a four-way tie for the US Open lead while Phil Mickelson incurs a two-shot penalty.BBC SportComments,"Justin Rose won the 2013 US Open at Merion Golf Club US Open, third round +3D Berger (US), T Finau (US), B Koepka (US), D Johnson (US);+4J Rose (Eng);+5H Stenson (Swe) Selected others: +7I Poulter (Eng), T Hatton (Eng);+8M Fitzpatrick (Eng);+9P Casey (Eng), R Knox (Sco), T Fleetwood (Eng);+17P Mickelson (US) Full leaderboard,external England's Justin Rose is one shot off of a four-way tie for the US Open lead amid a major third-round controversy involving USA's Phil Mickelson. Rose, the 2013 champion, shot a three-over 73 at Shinnecock Hills to end four over and trail Dustin Johnson, Daniel Berger, Tony Finau, and Brooks Koepka. World number one Johnson, who had led by four after round two, hit a 77. Mickelson incurred a two-shot penalty after deliberately stopping his ball from rolling off the 13th green. Rules officials could have chosen to disqualify the six-time US Open runner-up but instead elected to penalise the American, who shot an 11-over 81 to drop to 17 over. ""If someone is offended I apologise, but toughen up. Knowing the rules is never a bad thing. You always want to use them in your favour,"" said Mickelson. Reaction and debate: The Cut - BBC Radio 5 live golf podcast Rose described conditions as very hard and added: ""The course was just a battle. There was no reprieve out there with any shots but I survived it and I've now got a good shot,"" said Rose. Fellow Englishman Ian Poulter slipped down into a tie for 10th at seven over after a 76. Americans Berger and Finau matched the best round of the week in advantageous morning conditions with four-under 66s, and were in the clubhouse tied for 45th overall as the leading pairs took to the course. Tight pin positions, coupled with greens which grew harder and faster as the wind and sun dried them out, limited scoring in the afternoon, with two-time major champion Zach Johnson, who had a two-over 72 to drop to eight over, suggesting the course had ""surpassed"" the limit of fairness and playability. Mickelson needs the US Open to complete a career grand slam of major titles Mickelson, who was five over par for his round before playing the 13th, defended his decision to jog after and then hit his missed bogey putt back towards the hole despite the ball still moving and appearing to be heading off the green. He eventually needed eight strokes to complete the hole before accepting a two-shot penalty from the United States Golf Association (USGA) for ""making a stroke at a moving ball"", rather than the more severe offence of ""an action with the intent to influence the movement of a ball in play"" which could have resulted in disqualification. The five-time major champion, celebrating his 48th birthday, said he quickly decided the two-stroke penalty would be better than allowing the ball to roll off the green. ""I know the rules and the ball was going to go off in a bad spot. I did not feel like continuing going back and forth. I would still be out there potentially. I've wanted to do it many times before and finally did,"" said Mickelson. Playing partner Andrew 'Beef' Johnston laughed off the incident as ""a moment of madness"". Former Ryder Cup player Oliver Wilson, speaking on BBC Radio 5 live, labelled the incident ""comical"" and suggested Mickelson was ""very lucky"" to be handed ""the softer option"" of the two-shot penalty over potential disqualification.  ""If I was a player behind him, I'd be annoyed,"" he said. Asked why Rule 1-2, which covers a ball being ""influenced or deflected"" and can lead to disqualification for a ""serious breach"" was not invoked instead, John Bodenhamer, the USGA's senior managing director of championships and governance, said: ""Phil didn't purposely deflect or stop the ball, which is talked about in the reference under Rule 14-5. He played a moving ball."" Steve Elkington, the 1995 US PGA champion, was among several former players calling for Mickelson to be disqualified and he added on Twitter: ""Absolutely 100% conduct unbecoming."" BBC golf correspondent Iain Carter said: ""It was a deliberate breach of the rules. If that is not a serious breach of the etiquette of the game, I don't know what is."" Mickelson faced the media after the third round controversy Mickelson's decision was certainly an unusual solution - John Daly did similar at the 1999 US Open - but was a sign of things to come for the leading groups, who endured the worst of the conditions on sun-baked greens. The last time Shinnecock Hills in New York state hosted the US Open in 2004, play had to be suspended during the final round to water the seventh green which had become unplayable. USGA chief Mike Davis insisted before this year's tournament thatlessons had been learnedbut after Saturday's round, in which only three players broke par, he said: ""We will admit there were some aspects of the set-up where we went too far, in that well-executed shots were not rewarded and in some cases penalised."" ""It got too tough in some areas. If we got a mulligan, we would have slowed the greens down this afternoon. We are confident we can slow the golf course down going into Sunday."" Davis revealed Mickelson had telephoned him to clarify whether or not he should have been disqualified. ""Phil really did want to understand how the rule operates because he didn't want to... frankly, as he said to me, he goes, Mike, I don't want to play in this championship if I should have been disqualified,"" said Davis. ""That's where we clarified that, Phil, you actually made a stroke at a moving ball, and so we have to apply that rule (14-5). ""That's different than if he had deliberately just stopped the ball or whacked it in another direction or something like that. So it's just, it's us applying the rules."" Virtually every hole seemed to offer its own challenge of stopping the ball on the putting surface, with seemingly regulation shots rolling off the greens, leaving many players frustrated. Spain's Rafa Cabrera Bello, who finished his six-over 76 with a triple-bogey seven on the 18th, labelled it ""not a fair test of golf"". ""Greens were unplayable, with unnecessary pin positions. USGA found a way to make us look like fools on the course. A pity they manage to destroy a beautiful golf course,"" added the Spaniard on Twitter. Ian Poulter shared a one-shot lead after the first round Poulter also fell foul of the conditions, particularly on the 15th hole, when his ""perfect bunker shot"" landed five feet short of the hole. He said: ""The ball had no speed on it but it ran five, six, eight, 10, 20, 50 feet past the hole. It was impossible. ""It was brutally tough. Some of the putts were impossible. Some of the pin positions were impossible to get at, to even leave yourself a 25-foot uphill putt. They set it up like this for a reason. They want it brutally hard. It's a stern test."" And Davis' comments did little to appease the world number 27, who is seeking his first major success. In a rant on Twitter, Poulter said of Davis' words: ""Is that an apology? You don't get mulligans in business at this level. How can this team keep doing this without consequences?"" The Englishman also said he had been verbally abused on every hole by spectators, and at one point spectators cheered as his ball dribbled off a green with some loudly calling him a ""clown"". Sweden's Henrik Stenson, who briefly held the lead during the early stages of his round, had five bogeys on the back nine of his four-over 74. He too saw an excellent bunker shot gather pace and run off the back green on the 15th. ""It's a bit of a lottery at times and it's a bit ridiculous at times but we know that. It seems to be the goal of the USGA otherwise they wouldn't keep doing this. But I'm in a decent position,"" he said after dropping back to five over overall. Dustin Johnson won his sole major at the 2016 US Open at Oakmont Country Club Johnson had just four bogeys in his opening 36 holes, which resulted in the 2016 champion holding a four-shot halfway lead. But after a first double bogey of the week at the par-three second, four bogeys followed on the front nine as Johnson surrendered the lead. He steadied himself on the back nine, with a birdie on the 11th and he had a one-shot lead playing the last but finished with a three-putt bogey from 18 feet. ""I didn't feel like I played badly at all,"" he said. Seven over is usually a terrible score, but with the greens the way they got this afternoon - they were very, very difficult,"" he said.

""We'll try to be as organised as possible, you need to provoke a team like Brazil into making mistakes so you can create opportunities, that's the mentality you need to have because we'll need to score one or two goals to win the game."" Brazil v Switzerland (19:00 BST) Brazil manager Tite says forward Neymar is still not completely fit for their opening match of the tournament against Switzerland. The PSG star has been out with a broken metatarsal in his right foot since February. ""Neymar is not 100% yet,"" Tite said. ""But he is privileged and strong physically. He is very quick, and he hasn't lost that. ""I hope he'll be ready, but the medical staff knows better. He's good enough to play very well."" Brazil v Switzerland (19:00 BST) Mark LawrensonFormer Liverpool defender Brazil are my pick to win the World Cup, because the players they have got in midfield and attack are just frightening. Switzerland, in contrast, are more workmanlike but, as a team, they are greater than the sum of their parts. I don't see them causing Brazil too many problems, but they can finish second in Group E. Prediction:2-0 Read Lawro's full predictions #bbcworldcup Garry McCammon:If Belgium can click they've as good a squad as anyone, they just lack fluidity. Duncan Mciver:Spain have the best team and best squad. Look at their substitutes from Friday's game - Aspas, AlcÃ¡ntara and Lucas Vasquez would make it into most other teams. They only drew because of three mistakes. They won't make as many in the rest of the tournament. Stephen Shaw:Brazil - people keep saying they have a point to prove. They did in 2014 too and look how that went. Less pressure though this time. Germany - always poor the next World Cup after winning it, and playing badly recently too.

They were singing long into last night, despite yesterday's cruel defeat by Denmark. There were absolutely loads of them here in Saransk. I'd be tempted to say 80% of the 40,000 at the ground. Denmark had a few in one corner, and I didn't come across a local who hadn't been carried away by all the colour, humour and warmth. There were inflatable vicunas (the Peruvian national animal - a relative of the llama), men wearing giant plastic ears in homage to winger Edison Flores, and so much love for their team, despite all the adversity.

Melbourne store to allow nude photo shoot,"On 9th July, this Melbourne car park will be full of naked people Australian supermarket chain Woolworths says US artist Spencer Tunick can use a car park on top of one of its Melbourne stores for a mass naked photo shoot, reversing an earlier decision. In April, Woolworths turned down Mr Tunick's request to use the location in Prahran, saying it would be too disruptive on a Saturday. An online petition was launched. Now Woolworths says he can use the car park for an hour on a Monday morning.  ""It's a good outcome,"" said the store. How it feels to strip down for nude art Thousands strip naked for Tunick artwork The photo shoot is part of theChapel Street Provocare arts festival,externalin the upmarket district of Victoria's state capital. ""In further discussions with the festival organisers, they indicated a willingness to be flexible with dates and times to ensure the shoot could happen without inconveniencing our customers during busy weekend trading,"" said a Woolworths' spokesperson quoted by the Melbourne Age. John Lotton, director of festival, told Reuters news agency: ""We're over the moon."" About 11,000 people have so far registered to strip off for the camera on 9 July, more than could fit onto the rooftop car park. ""It is well and truly oversubscribed,"" said Mr Lotton. When proposing the event, Mr Tunick said about 500 people would feature in the shoot. ""We will also be asking participants to use public transport to avoid the limited parking that is available in the area being unavailable to those shopping at Woolworths or other local retailers during this time,"" added Mr Lotton. New York-based Mr Tunick is famed for his pictures of naked crowds, sometimes at global landmarks. His previous artwork in Melbourne involved more than 4,000 volunteers covering a city river bank. Mr Tunick has produced more than 120 nude group installations in more than 30 countries, including a shoot at the Sydney Opera House in 2010.

May defends Brexit bill offer to rebels,"Dominic Grieve said the government's amendment was ""valueless"" Tory rebels ""could collapse the government"" if they vote against a Brexit deal negotiated with the EU, a leading rebel has said. Dominic Grieve said he wakes up ""in a cold sweat"" thinking about what could happen if a final deal is rejected. But he suggested rebels would not back down in a current row with ministers about how much of a say MPs should get. The EU Withdrawal Bill returns to the Lords and Commons this week, with further rebellions expected. Rebels: Brexit bill offer is a slap in the face PM 'must honour Brexit vote assurances' Last week the government avoided a defeat on the bill after agreeing to hold further talks with rebels. They want a bigger role for Parliament, should a final Brexit deal be rejected by MPs, or if no deal is reached - the so-called ""meaningful vote"". Former Attorney General Mr Grieve told BBC One's Sunday Politics that he thought they had agreed MPs could have an ""advisory"" vote, that would not order the government to do anything, but would help people to ""keep calm"" during what would be a ""critical situation"". But after two days of talks, Mr Grieve said a government amendment drawn up to avert a rebellion was changed at the last minute and was now ""valueless"". He implied rebels would vote against it this week: ""I'm absolutely sure that the group is quite determined that the meaningful vote pledge, which was given to us, has got to be fulfilled."" He added: ""The alternative is that we've all got to sign up to a slavery clause now, saying whatever the government does, when it comes to January, however potentially catastrophic it might be for my constituents and my country, I'm signing in blood now that I will follow over the edge of a cliff, and that I can tell you, I am not prepared to do."" The government's amendment to the EU (Withdrawal) Bill sets out what must happen in the event of three scenarios: If MPs vote down the UK-EU Brexit deal, if Theresa May announces before 21 January 2019 that no deal has been reached, or if 21st January passes with no deal being struck. Under these circumstances, a minister must make a statement in Parliament setting out their next steps and give MPs an opportunity to vote. However, the vote would be on ""a motion in neutral terms"", merely stating that the House has considered the statement. Rebels had originally wanted the amendment to say that the government must seek the approval of Parliament for its course of action - and that ministers must be directed by MPs and peers. When it was put to him that voting against any Brexit deal at ""the 11th hour"" of negotiations could cause the government to collapse, he replied:  ""We could collapse the government and I can assure you, I wake up at 2am in a cold sweat thinking about the problems that we have put on our shoulders."" Last week another Conservative MP, Tom Tugendhat,told Sky News,externalthere was ""going to be a new government"" if MPs rejected the government's Brexit deal. Solicitor General Robert Buckland said that ""however well intentioned"" Mr Grieve's plan had been, his worry was that ""it actually plays badly in the most important negotiation, which is over in Brussels"". It would imply to the EU, he said, that ""there's a third party in this relationship"" - Parliament - which could ""trump whatever the UK government say"". He said ministers would stick with the new amendment for Monday, adding: ""Let's see what the Lords make of it. Of course we have Tuesday to consider matters ahead of the Wednesday vote."" Earlier the prime minister defended her handling of the row. She told BBC One's Andrew Marr Show she had met Tory rebels and ""undertook to consider their concerns"". She admitted there had been ""a debate"" about what a ""meaningful"" vote for Parliament meant: ""I've listened carefully to the concerns, I've put an amendment down which I think balances this issue of the role of Parliament together with the need for us to ensure we don't overturn the decision of the British people."" But she said Parliament ""cannot tie the hands of government in negotiations"". The main purposes of the EU Withdrawal Bill are to end the supremacy of EU law in the UK, and transfer existing EU law into UK law so the same rules and regulations apply on the day after Brexit. But as it passes through Parliament, MPs and peers have been trying to change it, in some cases adding bits on that would change the government's Brexit strategy. The government says the whole row is about a ""hypothetical"" scenario and they are ""confident we will agree a good deal with the EU which Parliament will support"".

""So people are in a bad state..., and they are really relieved to come on safe land at the moment."" They come from 26 countries. Reports say the largest groups (about 150 each) are from Sudan and Nigeria, with dozens more from Eritrea, South Sudan and Algeria. Most of the rest of the 630 are from other African countries but a handful are from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Officials say the rescued migrants include 123 unaccompanied minors, 11 younger children under the age of 13 and seven pregnant women. Initially, the migrants will receive food and hygiene kits and everything else necessary to make them comfortable after weeks of hardship, Red Cross official Pedro Redon told the BBC. The pregnant women will be taken for check-ups. Everyone on board will receive psychological help and the Spanish government has promised them medical assistance. Police will have to identify them and take them to police stations to initiate immigration procedures. French President Emmanuel Macron's government will work with Spain to deal with the migrants. Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo said that any migrants who wish to go to France would be allowed to do, providing they had a legitimate claim to asylum. The Aquarius sparked a major diplomatic row when it was left stranded on Monday. Italy's populist coalition,external- and in particular its interior minister, the right-wing League party leader Matteo Salvini - has taken a hard-line approach to immigration and refused to let it dock.

Glasgow art school fire operation continuesCrews spend a second day working to extinguish the blaze that engulfed the Glasgow School of Art.,"The art school building has been devastated by the fire The fire-ravaged structure of the Glasgow School of Art may have to be demolished, a leading construction expert has warned. Billy Hare, a professor of construction management, said there was a ""growing consensus"" the globally-significant building may have to be pulled down. It came as fire crews spent a second day working to extinguish the blaze, which also damaged the O2 ABC venue. Art school staff have seen the damaged Mackintosh building for the first time. They were able to see what remains of the historic shell from the college's adjoining buildings. Muriel Grey, the chairwoman of the board of the governors, said: ""It is an understatement to say everyone is utterly devastated."" Fire chiefs said the fire had largely been contained and thermal imaging cameras were being used to identify any remaining hotspots. Prof Hare, deputy director of The Beam Research Centre at Glasgow Caledonian University, warned that the building could be structurally unsound. This video can not be played Aerial footage shows scale of the Glasgow School of Art fire He compared the intensity of the blaze with a fire which started in the roof of a building housing Victoria's nightclub in nearby Sauchiehall Street in March. Within days of that fire,Glasgow City Council confirmed it would demolish the building. Prof Hare told BBC Scotland:  ""At that stage the decision was taken fairly quickly to demolish that building. ""However, the Mack being such a globally-recognised building of significance, this would probably have a bit more deliberation before they come to that decision. ""But the consensus is beginning to grow over the last 24 hours that that might very well be the case."" How Glasgow earned its reputation as the 'Tinderbox City' Timeline: The art school's devastating years 'I assumed it was a social media blip' The world's love of Glasgow School of Art He said if it was not possible to retain the facade of the building, it may be possible to take down the building brick-by-brick and rebuild with a new internal frame. A painstaking project such as that could cost in excess of Â£100m, he warned. As it was: the art school building was under reconstruction from the first fire in 2014 After the fire: the art school and a neighbouring building have been devastated, Friday night's blaze was the second to hit the Charles Rennie Mackintosh-designed building in four years. It was undergoing an extensive restoration, costing up to Â£35m, while staff and students worked in neighbouring buildings on the campus. The Mackintosh building was under the day-to-day control of Kier Construction. Scotland's First Minister Nicola Sturgeon described the damage from the latest fire as ""heartbreaking"". Miles Glendinning, a professor of architectural conservation, told BBC Radio Scotland that the building ""should be restored and will be restored"". He said ""remarkable"" record-keeping during the restoration process following the 2014 fire meant the art school still exists in digital form. Speaking to Good Morning Scotland, he said: ""A Glasgow School of Art project team [made] a digital recording reconstruction of the whole building, not just the bit that was affected before, down to the nearest millimetre, outside and in, using photos and measured drawings. ""So the building still exists digitally even if the inside is for the moment physically absent."" He said he would be ""very surprised"" if the building had to be knocked down and rebuilt, saying the walls could instead be reinforced. In a statement released by Glasgow School of Art on Sunday evening, Muriel Gray said they had a ""difficult waiting game"" while investigations were carried out into the condition of the building. ""We remain hopeful of as positive an outcome as possible because it is clear that the love for the Mackintosh and recognition of its importance to Glasgow and the wider world is shared by absolutely everyone,"" she added. The art school's director Prof Tom Inns said its priority was to continue to operate the school with minimum disruption to staff and students. Meanwhile, Scottish Secretary David Mundell ruled out a public inquiry into the blaze ""unless someone can bring forward some exceptional reason"". He said various investigations would be held into the cause of the fire - as with any other similar incident. Scottish Culture Secretary Fiona Hyslop was also asked about the possibility of a public inquiry on BBC's Sunday Politics Scotland. She said: ""I understand people want a lot of questions answered but clearly we have to have the fire investigation first and we have to give them the time to carry out their very responsible duties to best effect."" The fire could be seen throughout Glasgow city centre Firefighters continue to damp down the fire at the Mackintosh building and the O2 ABC music venue Labour MP Paul Sweeney, who visited the site on Saturday night,shared several videos on Twitter,externalshowing the damaged building from different angles. He described part of the 1909 library extension as a ""tangled mess of charred timber and distorted steel joists"" - but added that some structural joists and outer walls appear to be solid and stable. He said the eastern wing, which dates from 1899, appears to have been hit worse - with some of the stone ""baked"", fractured or ""visibly moved"" by the heat. The neighbouring O2 ABC collapsed and glass panels on a building opposite shattered from the high temperature, Mr Sweeney added. Allow Twitter content?

The Glasgow North East MP raised concerns about the role of the contractor, Kier Construction. ""I have to say it's extremely worrying that within the space of four years, this could happen again,"" he said. ""Questions have to be raised about the contractor and how the contractor who had responsibility for the site has managed that site if the security had been sufficient, and so on."" Kier Construction said it was devastated by the fire and was working closely with the fire service in their investigation. No-one was injured by the fire, which was reported at about 23:20 on Friday. At the height of the blaze, a total of 120 firefighters and 20 fire engines were at the scene and nearby homes were evacuated as a precaution. Hoses brought water from the River Clyde to help fight the flames. A total of 50 firefighters, six fire engines and two high-reach appliances remained at the scene on Sunday. The fire service said it was too early to speculate on the cause, adding that forensic experts would not be able to gain access to the building until it had been made safe. Group Manager Martin Hill said: ""This has clearly been a protracted incident and today we are still very much in a firefighting phase. ""Our firefighters have been working effectively throughout the night and we are continuing to dampen down any remaining pockets of fire. ""We will remain on the scene for as long as it takes - we are absolutely committed to preventing any further damage to surrounding properties and ensuring the area is made safe."" The fire ripped through the newly-restored building on Friday night Chief officer Alasdair Hay would not be drawn on whether the building would have to be pulled down over safety fears. He said the fire service was working with structural engineers and Glasgow City Council's building control department during the operation. ""This is a heartbreaking incident and if we could take any solace from it, there has been no injuries,"" he told the BBC News Channel. ""And what we want to absolutely avoid at this stage is for anyone to get injured, so we are being very cautious."" Sturgeon says blaze is 'heartbreaking' The story of the fire and its aftermath Scotland reacts to Glasgow art school fire First Minister Nicola Sturgeon visited the site on Saturday. She said: ""The fire has been a devastating blaze, much worse than the one that took hold of the Mackintosh building four years ago. ""The damage is severe and extensive. My heart goes out to everybody associated with the art school."" Ms Sturgeon said the Scottish government stood ""ready to provide any support"" in the wake of the blaze. Prime Minister Theresa May said the UK government would support the Scottish government in restoration efforts. The A-listed building, considered to be Charles Rennie Mackintosh's masterpiece, wasbadly damaged in a blaze in May 2014. The Mackintosh building was completed in 1909 based on designs by Charles Rennie Mackintosh, Scotland's most-lauded designer. Glasgow School of Art has produced a number of leading contemporary artists, including Douglas Gordon, Alison Watt, David Shrigley, and  recent Turner Prize winners Simon Starling, Richard Wright and Martin Boyce.

Greek PM survives vote over Macedonia deal,"Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has agreed a deal with Macedonia over its name Greek Prime Minister Alexis Tsipras has survived a no-confidence vote over the deal his government made to settle a name dispute with Macedonia. It was tabled by the country's main opposition party, New Democracy, but was rejected by 153 votes to 127. The result paves the way for an historic signing ceremony on Sunday. Mr Tsipras and his Macedonian counterpart Zoran Zaev have agreed that Greece's neighbour will be renamed the Republic of North Macedonia. The aim of the deal was to distinguish it from a province in northern Greece also called Macedonia. The name has been a subject of contention for more than two decades since the break-up of the former Yugoslavia, with Athens arguing that by using the name Macedonia the country was implying it had a claim to the Greek region. Full story: What's the name row about?,external The man who has focused on one word for 23 years,external But opposition figures in Greece argue that Mr Tsipras has made too many concessions in the deal. On Saturday, protesters angry with the government briefly clashed with police on the steps of the parliament building. Following the vote, the foreign ministers from both countries are expected to meet on the border for a ceremony in which they will sign the agreement. Greek Foreign Minister Nikos Kotzias and Macedonia's Nikola Dimitrov will sign the pact on Sunday and both prime ministers will be present. But there is still some way to go before the name change becomes official. Demonstrators took to the streets on Saturday to protest against the agreement Yes, the agreement will have to overcome a few obstacles before it goes through. Macedonia's parliament will first need to back the deal. That would be followed by a referendum in September or October. If voters there support it, the government would have to change the constitution which is a key Greek demand. Things have been complicated further as Macedonia's President Gjorge Ivanov is refusing to sign the agreement. He has the power to veto the deal - but not indefinitely. The Macedonian president has the power to veto the name deal If he refuses to sign it, it will be sent back to parliament for a second vote. If it passes again, President Ivanov would then be obliged to approve the legislation. The deal will finally have to be ratified by the Greek parliament, a process which may also not be straightforward.

Sinn FÃÂ©in vote to change abortion policy,"Sinn FÃ©in delegates have voted to change the party's position on abortion at a conference in Belfast. Members comprehensively backed a leadership motion stating that women should have access to abortions within ""a limited gestational period"". The party can now support a law due to be brought before the Irish parliament, which is expected to allow abortions within the first 12 weeks of pregnancy. More than 20 Sinn FÃ©in branches had called for a free conscience vote. The decision comes shortly after a referendum in the Republic of Ireland removed a constitutional amendment which effectively outlawed abortion. Previously Sinn FÃ©in had backed making terminations available in circumstances like fatal foetal abnormality, rape or sexual abuse. However, the party will now back a policy put forward by the Sinn FÃ©in leadership that is broadly in line with the new Irish law, which is expected to make abortion available to women within the first 12 weeks of their pregnancies. Sinn FÃ©in's Stormont leader Michelle O'Neill opened the debate and told delegates: ""No-one is saying members can't have a conscience and you're entitled to have your viewpoint respected, but there is a difference between personal views and our role as legislators."" However, the few speakers supportive of a conscience vote said that by not allowing members to have a free vote, SF was effectively going to create a ""cold house"" for those members who take a different view on abortion. Sinn FÃ©in voted to change party policy at a conference in Belfast Unlike other parts of the UK, the 1967 Abortion Act does not extend to Northern Ireland, meaning that it is the only region of the UK or Ireland where abortion is illegal unless there is a serious risk to a woman's life or health. Abortions in cases of rape, incest or fatal foetal abnormalities are not automatically legally permitted to be carried out. Northern Ireland has been without a functioning government since the collapse of power-sharing between Sinn FÃ©in and the DUP in January 2017. The issue of abortion in Northern Ireland has been debated in the House of Commons, but Downing Street says it should be dealt with by Stormont once devolution is restored. On the day of the referendum result in Dublin, Mrs O'Neill and party president Mary Lou McDonald held up a sign stating that the ""north is next"". The vote in the Republic is expected to pave the way for unrestricted access to abortion during the first 12 weeks of a pregnancy. This has been a defining conference for Sinn FÃ©in. The first conference without Gerry Adams at the helm, the focus was very much on the party's priorities under the new leadership of Mary Lou McDonald and Michelle O'Neill. Both women had already openly advocated relaxing the party's policy on abortion - today their base appeared to echo that. A long queue of people lined up to speak, and of all the delegates who took to the podium to express their views, only a handful supported giving members a conscience vote. The decision to back the leadership on this issue is a significant one. Out of the five main Stormont parties (bar the DUP who are staunchly opposed to abortion), Sinn FÃ©in is now the only one that will not allow its members a conscience vote on abortion. Ending the debate, the party's MEP Martina Anderson said there was ""absolutely no space"" for a conscience clause. But will some of Sinn FÃ©in's members feel there is no longer a space for them in the party because of today's vote? Time will tell. At the conference on Saturday, the party's leadership had backed a motion stating that women should have access to abortions within a ""a limited gestational period"". The motion by the party leadership did not specify the 12-week period, but refers to making abortions available through a GP-led service ""without specific indication for a limited gestational period"". Mrs O'Neill denied that this gives the Sinn FÃ©in leadership a blank cheque to eventually back abortion in line with the 24-week period provided by the UK's 1967 Act, arguing it allowed the party flexibility in case legislation brought before the DÃ¡il (Irish parliament) eventually reduces the time limit to 10 weeks. Protesters at the Sinn FÃ©in ard fheis A former Mayor of Limavady, Anne Brolly, and her husband, Francie, who was previously elected to the Stormont Assembly, both resigned from the party over the issue. Two Sinn FÃ©in TDs (members of the Irish parliament), Peadar TÃ³ibÃ­n and Carol Nolan, have been suspended in recent years for voting against party policy. With the exception of the DUP - which opposes any change to Northern Ireland's law - the other main parties, Alliance, the SDLP and the Ulster Unionists all allow a freedom of conscience approach amongst its members.

Spain welcomes Aquarius migrants,"This video can not be played Aquarius: Migrant ship arrives in Spain Migrants rescued from the Mediterranean and turned away by Italy and Malta have arrived in Spain's port of Valencia. Three vessels, including the Aquarius, which rescued the 630 migrants last weekend, have now docked in the harbour. Health officials, interpreters and Red Cross workers are on hand to offer support. Spain's new socialist government has promised free healthcare and says it will investigate each asylum case. ""It is our duty to help avoid a humanitarian catastrophe and offer a safe port to these people, to comply with our human rights obligations,"" Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez said earlier this week. Is Italy taking in thousands of migrants? Who is responsible for helping migrants at sea?,external Migrant crisis: Just a mess or cynical politics? He has adopted a migrant-friendly stance since taking up his post two weeks ago. An Italian coast guard ship, the Dattilo, entered the port of Valencia at 06:20 (04:20 GMT). It was carrying 274 migrants, the Italian news agency Ansa reported. On Valencia's quayside, 1,000 Red Cross workers were on hand to greet the migrants as they stepped off the ship. Police officers have also been drafted in to handle their arrival. The Aquarius itself entered the port shortly after 09:30 carrying another 106 migrants. They were seen celebrating as the ship arrived. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Another Italian ship, the Orione, docked later with the rest of the migrants. The migrants spent 20 hours in overcrowded rubber dinghies before being rescued by the Aquarius. They have since spent a week in rough seas - with many suffering seasickness. ""The weather was very bad unfortunately, and the sea was rough,"" Sophie Beau of aid organisation SOS MÃ©diterranÃ©e told the BBC. ""So people are in a bad state..., and they are really relieved to come on safe land at the moment."" They come from 26 countries. Reports say the largest groups (about 150 each) are from Sudan and Nigeria, with dozens more from Eritrea, South Sudan and Algeria. Most of the rest of the 630 are from other African countries but a handful are from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Officials say the rescued migrants include 123 unaccompanied minors, 11 younger children under the age of 13 and seven pregnant women. Initially, the migrants will receive food and hygiene kits and everything else necessary to make them comfortable after weeks of hardship, Red Cross official Pedro Redon told the BBC. The pregnant women will be taken for check-ups. Everyone on board will receive psychological help and the Spanish government has promised them medical assistance. Police will have to identify them and take them to police stations to initiate immigration procedures. French President Emmanuel Macron's government will work with Spain to deal with the migrants. Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo said that any migrants who wish to go to France would be allowed to do, providing they had a legitimate claim to asylum. The Aquarius sparked a major diplomatic row when it was left stranded on Monday. Italy's populist coalition,external- and in particular its interior minister, the right-wing League party leader Matteo Salvini - has taken a hard-line approach to immigration and refused to let it dock. Mr Salvini says it is unfair that countries on the frontline of the EU have had to carry most of the burden of handling the migrant influx. He said Malta should accept the Aquarius, but it refused, arguing that it fell under Italian jurisdiction. Valencia's Mayor Joan Ribo, who has offered the ship a safe berth, described Italy's decision to turn the vessel away as inhuman. This video can not be played On board the Aquarius, people rest in cramped conditions He told the BBC that he hoped the city's actions would act as an ""electric shock"" and lead to reform of Europe's migration policies. Earlier, Mr Macron accused Italy of ""irresponsibility"" for turning the Aquarius away. Migration reform is likely to be a key topic at a meeting of EU leaders later this month, as many countries continue to grapple with the political fallout caused by an influx of migrants in recent years.

Rose one back amid Mickelson controversy,"Justin Rose won the 2013 US Open at Merion Golf Club US Open, third round +3D Berger (US), T Finau (US), B Koepka (US), D Johnson (US);+4J Rose (Eng);+5H Stenson (Swe) Selected others: +7I Poulter (Eng), T Hatton (Eng);+8M Fitzpatrick (Eng);+9P Casey (Eng), R Knox (Sco), T Fleetwood (Eng);+17P Mickelson (US) Full leaderboard,external England's Justin Rose is one shot off of a four-way tie for the US Open lead amid a major third-round controversy involving USA's Phil Mickelson. Rose, the 2013 champion, shot a three-over 73 at Shinnecock Hills to end four over and trail Dustin Johnson, Daniel Berger, Tony Finau, and Brooks Koepka. World number one Johnson, who had led by four after round two, hit a 77. Mickelson incurred a two-shot penalty after deliberately stopping his ball from rolling off the 13th green. Rules officials could have chosen to disqualify the six-time US Open runner-up but instead elected to penalise the American, who shot an 11-over 81 to drop to 17 over. ""If someone is offended I apologise, but toughen up. Knowing the rules is never a bad thing. You always want to use them in your favour,"" said Mickelson. Reaction and debate: The Cut - BBC Radio 5 live golf podcast Rose described conditions as very hard and added: ""The course was just a battle. There was no reprieve out there with any shots but I survived it and I've now got a good shot,"" said Rose. Fellow Englishman Ian Poulter slipped down into a tie for 10th at seven over after a 76. Americans Berger and Finau matched the best round of the week in advantageous morning conditions with four-under 66s, and were in the clubhouse tied for 45th overall as the leading pairs took to the course. Tight pin positions, coupled with greens which grew harder and faster as the wind and sun dried them out, limited scoring in the afternoon, with two-time major champion Zach Johnson, who had a two-over 72 to drop to eight over, suggesting the course had ""surpassed"" the limit of fairness and playability. Mickelson needs the US Open to complete a career grand slam of major titles Mickelson, who was five over par for his round before playing the 13th, defended his decision to jog after and then hit his missed bogey putt back towards the hole despite the ball still moving and appearing to be heading off the green. He eventually needed eight strokes to complete the hole before accepting a two-shot penalty from the United States Golf Association (USGA) for ""making a stroke at a moving ball"", rather than the more severe offence of ""an action with the intent to influence the movement of a ball in play"" which could have resulted in disqualification. The five-time major champion, celebrating his 48th birthday, said he quickly decided the two-stroke penalty would be better than allowing the ball to roll off the green. ""I know the rules and the ball was going to go off in a bad spot. I did not feel like continuing going back and forth. I would still be out there potentially. I've wanted to do it many times before and finally did,"" said Mickelson. Playing partner Andrew 'Beef' Johnston laughed off the incident as ""a moment of madness"". Former Ryder Cup player Oliver Wilson, speaking on BBC Radio 5 live, labelled the incident ""comical"" and suggested Mickelson was ""very lucky"" to be handed ""the softer option"" of the two-shot penalty over potential disqualification.  ""If I was a player behind him, I'd be annoyed,"" he said. Asked why Rule 1-2, which covers a ball being ""influenced or deflected"" and can lead to disqualification for a ""serious breach"" was not invoked instead, John Bodenhamer, the USGA's senior managing director of championships and governance, said: ""Phil didn't purposely deflect or stop the ball, which is talked about in the reference under Rule 14-5. He played a moving ball."" Steve Elkington, the 1995 US PGA champion, was among several former players calling for Mickelson to be disqualified and he added on Twitter: ""Absolutely 100% conduct unbecoming."" BBC golf correspondent Iain Carter said: ""It was a deliberate breach of the rules. If that is not a serious breach of the etiquette of the game, I don't know what is."" Mickelson faced the media after the third round controversy Mickelson's decision was certainly an unusual solution - John Daly did similar at the 1999 US Open - but was a sign of things to come for the leading groups, who endured the worst of the conditions on sun-baked greens. The last time Shinnecock Hills in New York state hosted the US Open in 2004, play had to be suspended during the final round to water the seventh green which had become unplayable. USGA chief Mike Davis insisted before this year's tournament thatlessons had been learnedbut after Saturday's round, in which only three players broke par, he said: ""We will admit there were some aspects of the set-up where we went too far, in that well-executed shots were not rewarded and in some cases penalised."" ""It got too tough in some areas. If we got a mulligan, we would have slowed the greens down this afternoon. We are confident we can slow the golf course down going into Sunday."" Davis revealed Mickelson had telephoned him to clarify whether or not he should have been disqualified. ""Phil really did want to understand how the rule operates because he didn't want to... frankly, as he said to me, he goes, Mike, I don't want to play in this championship if I should have been disqualified,"" said Davis. ""That's where we clarified that, Phil, you actually made a stroke at a moving ball, and so we have to apply that rule (14-5). ""That's different than if he had deliberately just stopped the ball or whacked it in another direction or something like that. So it's just, it's us applying the rules."" Virtually every hole seemed to offer its own challenge of stopping the ball on the putting surface, with seemingly regulation shots rolling off the greens, leaving many players frustrated. Spain's Rafa Cabrera Bello, who finished his six-over 76 with a triple-bogey seven on the 18th, labelled it ""not a fair test of golf"". ""Greens were unplayable, with unnecessary pin positions. USGA found a way to make us look like fools on the course. A pity they manage to destroy a beautiful golf course,"" added the Spaniard on Twitter. Ian Poulter shared a one-shot lead after the first round Poulter also fell foul of the conditions, particularly on the 15th hole, when his ""perfect bunker shot"" landed five feet short of the hole. He said: ""The ball had no speed on it but it ran five, six, eight, 10, 20, 50 feet past the hole. It was impossible. ""It was brutally tough. Some of the putts were impossible. Some of the pin positions were impossible to get at, to even leave yourself a 25-foot uphill putt. They set it up like this for a reason. They want it brutally hard. It's a stern test."" And Davis' comments did little to appease the world number 27, who is seeking his first major success. In a rant on Twitter, Poulter said of Davis' words: ""Is that an apology? You don't get mulligans in business at this level. How can this team keep doing this without consequences?"" The Englishman also said he had been verbally abused on every hole by spectators, and at one point spectators cheered as his ball dribbled off a green with some loudly calling him a ""clown"". Sweden's Henrik Stenson, who briefly held the lead during the early stages of his round, had five bogeys on the back nine of his four-over 74. He too saw an excellent bunker shot gather pace and run off the back green on the 15th. ""It's a bit of a lottery at times and it's a bit ridiculous at times but we know that. It seems to be the goal of the USGA otherwise they wouldn't keep doing this. But I'm in a decent position,"" he said after dropping back to five over overall. Dustin Johnson won his sole major at the 2016 US Open at Oakmont Country Club Johnson had just four bogeys in his opening 36 holes, which resulted in the 2016 champion holding a four-shot halfway lead. But after a first double bogey of the week at the par-three second, four bogeys followed on the front nine as Johnson surrendered the lead. He steadied himself on the back nine, with a birdie on the 11th and he had a one-shot lead playing the last but finished with a three-putt bogey from 18 feet. ""I didn't feel like I played badly at all,"" he said. Seven over is usually a terrible score, but with the greens the way they got this afternoon - they were very, very difficult,"" he said.

Tax increase 'to prevent NHS misery',"Taxes are going to have to rise to pay for the NHS if the UK is to avoid ""a decade of misery"" in which the old, sick and vulnerable are let down, say experts. The Institute for Fiscal Studies and Health Foundation said the NHS would need an extra 4% a year - or Â£2,000 per UK household - for the next 15 years. It said the only realistic way this could be paid for was by tax rises. It comes as ministers are arguing behind the scenes about NHS funding. NHS at 70: Share your memories and stories Why the Treasury is no fan of a ring-fenced 'NHS tax' NHS 'dangerously' short of 100,000 staff May backs long-term funding plan for NHS Pay rise agreed for 1.3 million NHS staff Join our Facebook group on the NHS and share your views.,external The prime minister has promised a long-term funding plan for the NHS. This is expected to cover the next decade and could be announced as soon as next month, in time for the 70th anniversary of the creation of the NHS. It has been announced that an 'NHS assembly' will be set up where national and local stakeholders can discuss progress on achieving plans for the NHS's future. The Treasury is believed to want to keep average rises at about 2% a year, but other ministers are arguing for more, the BBC understands. Health and Social Care Secretary Jeremy Hunt is believed to want at least 3% a year.

As those discussions continue, the IFS and Health Foundation have revealed the findings of their review, commissioned by the NHS Confederation, which represents NHS trusts. It warned the ageing population and rising number of people with long-term conditions, such as diabetes and heart disease, meant the health service needed more than it had been getting in the past decade. In recent years the annual rises once inflation is taken into account have been limited to just over 2%. But continuing in this vein would lead to a continued deterioration in performance, the report warned. Instead, it said, 5% extra was needed in the next five years, and then just under 4% for the following decade if it was going to improve. That would work out at an average of 4% a year over the period, while 3.3% would simply maintain services. On top of that, extra money would also be needed to fund council-run social care for the elderly. That would mean spending as a proportion of national income rising from 8.4% currently to 11.4%. By Laura Kuenssberg, BBC political editor Theresa May is grappling with ministers over NHS funding There's no coincidence at all that the independent number crunchers, the Institute for Fiscal Studies and the Health Foundation, have come forward with calls for significantly more cash for NHS England today. It matters right now because behind closed doors in Whitehall, the Department of Health, Downing Street and the Treasury are grappling to agree, not just how much the NHS really needs, but also what the government can really afford. Any eventual long term settlement involves extra billions of taxpayers' money - but if the government falls short, there's a heavy potential cost. What to do next is an intensely political choice. Read more of Laura's blog here. The report said it was ""hard to imagine"" raising that sort of money without increases in taxes. NHS Confederation chief executive Niall Dickson urged ministers not to rush into a quick fix, but warned any attempts to limit rises to 2% would backfire and lead to a ""decade of misery"". ""It is now undeniable that the current system and funding levels are not sustainable,"" he said. The Department of Health and Social Care said plans were being put in place to agree a multi-year settlement. The extra Â£2,000 in tax per household seems an eye-watering amount. But there is some context. That is the amount that would be needed by 2033 - and the economists were quick to point out that this has to be seen in the context that households will become richer. The forecast is that household wealth will rise by over Â£8,000 a year. So paying for the NHS would gobble up just under a quarter of that. Add in social care and it will be over a quarter. To increase tax income by that amount, it would require rises of 3p in the pound on each of income tax, VAT and National Insurance. Although the report said other options, including taxes on property and businesses, could be explored too. Even so, that would leave the UK as a relatively low-tax country. In terms of what that buys in the health service, Â£2,000 does not go very far. It will pay for a month of a staff nurse's salary, or cover 16 visits to A&E or eight ambulance journeys to hospital.

Rose one back as four share US Open lead,"Justin Rose won the 2013 US Open at Merion Golf Club US Open, third round +3D Berger (US), T Finau (US), B Koepka (US), D Johnson (US);+4J Rose (Eng);+5H Stenson (Swe) Selected others: +7I Poulter (Eng), T Hatton (Eng);+8M Fitzpatrick (Eng);+9P Casey (Eng), R Knox (Sco), T Fleetwood (Eng);+17P Mickelson (US) Full leaderboard,external England's Justin Rose is one shot off of a four-way tie for the US Open lead amid a major third-round controversy involving USA's Phil Mickelson. Rose, the 2013 champion, shot a three-over 73 at Shinnecock Hills to end four over and trail Dustin Johnson, Daniel Berger, Tony Finau, and Brooks Koepka. World number one Johnson, who had led by four after round two, hit a 77. Mickelson incurred a two-shot penalty after deliberately stopping his ball from rolling off the 13th green. Rules officials could have chosen to disqualify the six-time US Open runner-up but instead elected to penalise the American, who shot an 11-over 81 to drop to 17 over. ""If someone is offended I apologise, but toughen up. Knowing the rules is never a bad thing. You always want to use them in your favour,"" said Mickelson. Reaction and debate: The Cut - BBC Radio 5 live golf podcast Rose described conditions as very hard and added: ""The course was just a battle. There was no reprieve out there with any shots but I survived it and I've now got a good shot,"" said Rose. Fellow Englishman Ian Poulter slipped down into a tie for 10th at seven over after a 76. Americans Berger and Finau matched the best round of the week in advantageous morning conditions with four-under 66s, and were in the clubhouse tied for 45th overall as the leading pairs took to the course. Tight pin positions, coupled with greens which grew harder and faster as the wind and sun dried them out, limited scoring in the afternoon, with two-time major champion Zach Johnson, who had a two-over 72 to drop to eight over, suggesting the course had ""surpassed"" the limit of fairness and playability. Mickelson needs the US Open to complete a career grand slam of major titles Mickelson, who was five over par for his round before playing the 13th, defended his decision to jog after and then hit his missed bogey putt back towards the hole despite the ball still moving and appearing to be heading off the green. He eventually needed eight strokes to complete the hole before accepting a two-shot penalty from the United States Golf Association (USGA) for ""making a stroke at a moving ball"", rather than the more severe offence of ""an action with the intent to influence the movement of a ball in play"" which could have resulted in disqualification. The five-time major champion, celebrating his 48th birthday, said he quickly decided the two-stroke penalty would be better than allowing the ball to roll off the green. ""I know the rules and the ball was going to go off in a bad spot. I did not feel like continuing going back and forth. I would still be out there potentially. I've wanted to do it many times before and finally did,"" said Mickelson. Playing partner Andrew 'Beef' Johnston laughed off the incident as ""a moment of madness"". Former Ryder Cup player Oliver Wilson, speaking on BBC Radio 5 live, labelled the incident ""comical"" and suggested Mickelson was ""very lucky"" to be handed ""the softer option"" of the two-shot penalty over potential disqualification.  ""If I was a player behind him, I'd be annoyed,"" he said. Asked why Rule 1-2, which covers a ball being ""influenced or deflected"" and can lead to disqualification for a ""serious breach"" was not invoked instead, John Bodenhamer, the USGA's senior managing director of championships and governance, said: ""Phil didn't purposely deflect or stop the ball, which is talked about in the reference under Rule 14-5. He played a moving ball."" Steve Elkington, the 1995 US PGA champion, was among several former players calling for Mickelson to be disqualified and he added on Twitter: ""Absolutely 100% conduct unbecoming."" BBC golf correspondent Iain Carter said: ""It was a deliberate breach of the rules. If that is not a serious breach of the etiquette of the game, I don't know what is."" Mickelson faced the media after the third round controversy Mickelson's decision was certainly an unusual solution - John Daly did similar at the 1999 US Open - but was a sign of things to come for the leading groups, who endured the worst of the conditions on sun-baked greens. The last time Shinnecock Hills in New York state hosted the US Open in 2004, play had to be suspended during the final round to water the seventh green which had become unplayable. USGA chief Mike Davis insisted before this year's tournament thatlessons had been learnedbut after Saturday's round, in which only three players broke par, he said: ""We will admit there were some aspects of the set-up where we went too far, in that well-executed shots were not rewarded and in some cases penalised."" ""It got too tough in some areas. If we got a mulligan, we would have slowed the greens down this afternoon. We are confident we can slow the golf course down going into Sunday."" Davis revealed Mickelson had telephoned him to clarify whether or not he should have been disqualified. ""Phil really did want to understand how the rule operates because he didn't want to... frankly, as he said to me, he goes, Mike, I don't want to play in this championship if I should have been disqualified,"" said Davis. ""That's where we clarified that, Phil, you actually made a stroke at a moving ball, and so we have to apply that rule (14-5). ""That's different than if he had deliberately just stopped the ball or whacked it in another direction or something like that. So it's just, it's us applying the rules."" Virtually every hole seemed to offer its own challenge of stopping the ball on the putting surface, with seemingly regulation shots rolling off the greens, leaving many players frustrated. Spain's Rafa Cabrera Bello, who finished his six-over 76 with a triple-bogey seven on the 18th, labelled it ""not a fair test of golf"". ""Greens were unplayable, with unnecessary pin positions. USGA found a way to make us look like fools on the course. A pity they manage to destroy a beautiful golf course,"" added the Spaniard on Twitter. Ian Poulter shared a one-shot lead after the first round Poulter also fell foul of the conditions, particularly on the 15th hole, when his ""perfect bunker shot"" landed five feet short of the hole. He said: ""The ball had no speed on it but it ran five, six, eight, 10, 20, 50 feet past the hole. It was impossible. ""It was brutally tough. Some of the putts were impossible. Some of the pin positions were impossible to get at, to even leave yourself a 25-foot uphill putt. They set it up like this for a reason. They want it brutally hard. It's a stern test."" And Davis' comments did little to appease the world number 27, who is seeking his first major success. In a rant on Twitter, Poulter said of Davis' words: ""Is that an apology? You don't get mulligans in business at this level. How can this team keep doing this without consequences?"" The Englishman also said he had been verbally abused on every hole by spectators, and at one point spectators cheered as his ball dribbled off a green with some loudly calling him a ""clown"". Sweden's Henrik Stenson, who briefly held the lead during the early stages of his round, had five bogeys on the back nine of his four-over 74. He too saw an excellent bunker shot gather pace and run off the back green on the 15th. ""It's a bit of a lottery at times and it's a bit ridiculous at times but we know that. It seems to be the goal of the USGA otherwise they wouldn't keep doing this. But I'm in a decent position,"" he said after dropping back to five over overall. Dustin Johnson won his sole major at the 2016 US Open at Oakmont Country Club Johnson had just four bogeys in his opening 36 holes, which resulted in the 2016 champion holding a four-shot halfway lead. But after a first double bogey of the week at the par-three second, four bogeys followed on the front nine as Johnson surrendered the lead. He steadied himself on the back nine, with a birdie on the 11th and he had a one-shot lead playing the last but finished with a three-putt bogey from 18 feet. ""I didn't feel like I played badly at all,"" he said. Seven over is usually a terrible score, but with the greens the way they got this afternoon - they were very, very difficult,"" he said.

Spain to welcome Aquarius migrants,"This video can not be played Aquarius: Migrant ship arrives in Spain Migrants rescued from the Mediterranean and turned away by Italy and Malta have arrived in Spain's port of Valencia. Three vessels, including the Aquarius, which rescued the 630 migrants last weekend, have now docked in the harbour. Health officials, interpreters and Red Cross workers are on hand to offer support. Spain's new socialist government has promised free healthcare and says it will investigate each asylum case. ""It is our duty to help avoid a humanitarian catastrophe and offer a safe port to these people, to comply with our human rights obligations,"" Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez said earlier this week. Is Italy taking in thousands of migrants? Who is responsible for helping migrants at sea?,external Migrant crisis: Just a mess or cynical politics? He has adopted a migrant-friendly stance since taking up his post two weeks ago. An Italian coast guard ship, the Dattilo, entered the port of Valencia at 06:20 (04:20 GMT). It was carrying 274 migrants, the Italian news agency Ansa reported. On Valencia's quayside, 1,000 Red Cross workers were on hand to greet the migrants as they stepped off the ship. Police officers have also been drafted in to handle their arrival. The Aquarius itself entered the port shortly after 09:30 carrying another 106 migrants. They were seen celebrating as the ship arrived. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Another Italian ship, the Orione, docked later with the rest of the migrants. The migrants spent 20 hours in overcrowded rubber dinghies before being rescued by the Aquarius. They have since spent a week in rough seas - with many suffering seasickness. ""The weather was very bad unfortunately, and the sea was rough,"" Sophie Beau of aid organisation SOS MÃ©diterranÃ©e told the BBC. ""So people are in a bad state..., and they are really relieved to come on safe land at the moment."" They come from 26 countries. Reports say the largest groups (about 150 each) are from Sudan and Nigeria, with dozens more from Eritrea, South Sudan and Algeria. Most of the rest of the 630 are from other African countries but a handful are from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Officials say the rescued migrants include 123 unaccompanied minors, 11 younger children under the age of 13 and seven pregnant women. Initially, the migrants will receive food and hygiene kits and everything else necessary to make them comfortable after weeks of hardship, Red Cross official Pedro Redon told the BBC. The pregnant women will be taken for check-ups. Everyone on board will receive psychological help and the Spanish government has promised them medical assistance. Police will have to identify them and take them to police stations to initiate immigration procedures. French President Emmanuel Macron's government will work with Spain to deal with the migrants. Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo said that any migrants who wish to go to France would be allowed to do, providing they had a legitimate claim to asylum. The Aquarius sparked a major diplomatic row when it was left stranded on Monday. Italy's populist coalition,external- and in particular its interior minister, the right-wing League party leader Matteo Salvini - has taken a hard-line approach to immigration and refused to let it dock. Mr Salvini says it is unfair that countries on the frontline of the EU have had to carry most of the burden of handling the migrant influx. He said Malta should accept the Aquarius, but it refused, arguing that it fell under Italian jurisdiction. Valencia's Mayor Joan Ribo, who has offered the ship a safe berth, described Italy's decision to turn the vessel away as inhuman. This video can not be played On board the Aquarius, people rest in cramped conditions He told the BBC that he hoped the city's actions would act as an ""electric shock"" and lead to reform of Europe's migration policies. Earlier, Mr Macron accused Italy of ""irresponsibility"" for turning the Aquarius away. Migration reform is likely to be a key topic at a meeting of EU leaders later this month, as many countries continue to grapple with the political fallout caused by an influx of migrants in recent years.

Epileptic boy gets cannabis oil back,"This video can not be played Charlotte Caldwell says ""history has been made"" after the Home Office allowed her son to use cannabis oil A boy with severe epilepsy has been given back medicinal cannabis oil that was confiscated from his mother at customs, the home secretary has said. Billy Caldwell, 12, received the oil after doctors made clear it was a ""medical emergency"", Sajid Javid said. Billy's mother, Charlotte Caldwell, from County Tyrone, said they had ""achieved the impossible"" but called for the oil to be freely available. Billy began using cannabis oil in 2016 to control his seizures. The cannabis oil, which contains a substance called Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC), is illegal in the UK but available elsewhere. Billy's most recent supply - which Ms Caldwell had tried to bring into the UK from Canada -was confiscated at Heathrow Airport on Mondayand he was admitted to hospital before Mr Javid said it would be returned. The oil arrived at Chelsea and Westminster Hospital, where Billy is being treated, on Saturday afternoon. It was administered under a special 20-day licence and is not allowed to be taken home. A spokeswoman for the Home Office said it was an ""exceptional licence"" for a ""short term emergency"" and it would need to be reviewed. Ms Caldwell said: ""I truly believe that somewhere in the Home Office there's someone with a heart, and I truly believe that Billy was pulling on their heart strings."" But she said Billy's ""little body has been completely broken and his little mind"". ""No other family should have to go through this sort of ordeal, travelling half way round the world to get medication which should be freely available,"" she said. ""My experience leaves me in no doubt that the Home Office can no longer play a role in the administration of medication for sick children in our country. ""Children are dying in our country and it needs to stop now."" Billy was admitted to hospital in London on Friday Mr Javid said he had issued a licence to allow Billy to be treated with the cannabis oil after discussions with Billy's medical team. ""This is a very complex situation, but our immediate priority is making sure Billy receives the most effective treatment possible in a safe way,"" he said. ""My decision is based on the advice of senior clinicians who have made clear this is a medical emergency. ""The policing minister met with the family on Monday and since then has been working to reach an urgent solution."" Reality Check: Does UK export the most legal cannabis? Barbara Zieniewicz, co-founder of campaign group Families4Access, and who travelled to Canada with Billy and Ms Caldwell, called Mr Javid's decision ""triumphant"". ""I strongly believe that this is the first push - from here, it's a ripple effect. This means, to me, there is hope, not just for Billy, but for all the families that need it."" Billy, from Castlederg, started the treatment in 2016 in the US, where medical marijuana is legal. Ms Caldwell says Billy's seizures dramatically reduce when he takes the oil. In 2017, he was prescribed the medication on the NHS. But in May this year,his GP was told he could no longer prescribe it. At the time the Department of Health in Northern Ireland said cannabis had not yet been licensed in the UK as a medicine. Last Monday, Ms Caldwell tried to bring a six-month supply of the oil - to treat up to 100 seizures a day - into the UK from Toronto but the substance was confiscated by officials at Heathrow airport. The boy's family said he was taken to hospital when his seizures ""intensified"" in recent days. The family's MP, Ãrfhlaith Begley, said the Home Office's decision was ""life-saving"", adding: ""I will continue to engage with the Home Office and the health authorities to ensure he can access his medication in the longer term so there is no repeat of the trauma he has suffered over recent weeks."" Dr Amir Englund, who studies cannabis at the Institute of Psychiatry at King's College London, said: ""Clearly, there is evidence that Billy's medication works for him where others have failed. ""The duty of government is to protect its citizens from harm with regulations on medicines, so that the ones doctors prescribe are safe and effective. ""However, there are instances which these measures become counterproductive and harmful. This is such an instance, and the Home Office should allow an exemption so that he does not come to further harm."" Meanwhile, clinical lecturer in psychiatry at University College London, Dr Michael Bloomfield, said on the one hand ""current laws are too strict"", but added that the issue of medical marijuana is ""far from straightforward"". ""Any 'medical marijuana' needs a scientific evidence base, in the form of medical trials et cetera, which is currently lacking for many disorders and has become, for many jurisdictions, a potential way of decriminalising cannabis through the back door,"" he said. CBD and Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) are two types of cannabinoids found naturally in the resin of the marijuana plant. A cannabis-based drug called Sativex has been licensed in the UK to treat MS. It contains THC and CBD. Doctors could, in theory, prescribe it for other things outside of this licence, but at their own risk. MS patients prescribed Sativex, who resupply it to other people, also face prosecution. Another licensed treatment is Nabilone. It contains an artificial version of THC and can be given to cancer patients to help relieve nausea during chemotherapy.

Cannabis oil row prompts legalisation call,"This video can not be played Charlotte Caldwell said the medication ordeal had been 'horrific and cruel' The mum of a boy with severe epilepsy who had cannabis oil medication confiscated wants to meet the home secretary to discuss reforming the law. Charlotte Caldwell's son Billy, 12, uses the oil as his anti-seizure medication and she wants to be able to treat him with it at home. The Home Office has granted a limited licence for the drug to be administered to the child in hospital for 20 days. Billy is being treated at the Chelsea and Westminster Hospital in London. Ms Caldwell says her son's seizures dramatically reduce when he takes the oil, which contains a substance called Tetrahydrocannabinol (THC) that is illegal in the UK. On Monday Billy's supply - which Ms Caldwell had tried to bring in from Canada -was confiscated at Heathrowairport and he was admitted to hospital after his seizures ""intensified"". Home Secretary Sajid Javid later approved the use of cannabis oil after doctors made clear it was a medical emergency. The situation is under review. Ms Caldwell, from County Tyrone in Northern Ireland, wants to meet Mr Javid to discuss the matter and said: ""I will not stand by and let any other family in our country endure this experience. It's horrific and cruel."" Crispin Blunt MP, co-chair of the all-party parliamentary group on drug policy reform, said the existing law was ""frankly absurd"". This video can not be played Take a look inside the world's largest legal cannabis farm in Canada Dr Amir Englund, of the Institute of Psychiatry at King's College London, said an exemption should be made in Billy's case ""so that he does not come to further harm"". But UCL's Dr Michael Bloomfield said the use of medical marijuana is ""far from straightforward"". He said in some jurisdictions the drug's use for medical conditions is ""a potential way of decriminalising cannabis through the back door"". Reality Check: Does UK export the most legal cannabis? The Home Office's initial decision, and then its reversal, prompted calls for drug law reform from MPs on all sides. Billy was admitted to hospital in London on Friday Mr Blunt, a Conservative, said the existing law was based on an ""outdated"" claim that cannabis had no medicinal value. ""We need to get serious now about getting the benefits of these medicines, and move to change the frankly absurd position we are in,"" he said. Ex-Tory health minister Dan Poulter said the current situation was ""ridiculous"" and pledged to push for a change in the law. He said: ""I genuinely don't understand why we see... medicinal cannabis through the prism of the 1971 Misuse of Drugs legislation, when actually this is a medical issue, it's not a prohibition of drugs issue, and that's what's got to change."" In 2017, Billy was prescribed the medication on the NHS but last monthhis GP was told he could no longer prescribe it.

Three vessels, including the Aquarius, which rescued the 630 migrants last weekend, have now docked in the harbour. Health officials, interpreters and Red Cross workers are on hand to offer support. Spain's new socialist government has promised free healthcare and says it will investigate each asylum case. ""It is our duty to help avoid a humanitarian catastrophe and offer a safe port to these people, to comply with our human rights obligations,"" Prime Minister Pedro SÃ¡nchez said earlier this week.

He has adopted a migrant-friendly stance since taking up his post two weeks ago. An Italian coast guard ship, the Dattilo, entered the port of Valencia at 06:20 (04:20 GMT). It was carrying 274 migrants, the Italian news agency Ansa reported. On Valencia's quayside, 1,000 Red Cross workers were on hand to greet the migrants as they stepped off the ship. Police officers have also been drafted in to handle their arrival. The Aquarius itself entered the port shortly after 09:30 carrying another 106 migrants. They were seen celebrating as the ship arrived. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Another Italian ship, the Orione, docked later with the rest of the migrants. The migrants spent 20 hours in overcrowded rubber dinghies before being rescued by the Aquarius. They have since spent a week in rough seas - with many suffering seasickness. ""The weather was very bad unfortunately, and the sea was rough,"" Sophie Beau of aid organisation SOS MÃ©diterranÃ©e told the BBC. ""So people are in a bad state..., and they are really relieved to come on safe land at the moment."" They come from 26 countries. Reports say the largest groups (about 150 each) are from Sudan and Nigeria, with dozens more from Eritrea, South Sudan and Algeria. Most of the rest of the 630 are from other African countries but a handful are from Afghanistan, Pakistan and Bangladesh. Officials say the rescued migrants include 123 unaccompanied minors, 11 younger children under the age of 13 and seven pregnant women. Initially, the migrants will receive food and hygiene kits and everything else necessary to make them comfortable after weeks of hardship, Red Cross official Pedro Redon told the BBC. The pregnant women will be taken for check-ups. Everyone on board will receive psychological help and the Spanish government has promised them medical assistance. Police will have to identify them and take them to police stations to initiate immigration procedures. French President Emmanuel Macron's government will work with Spain to deal with the migrants. Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo said that any migrants who wish to go to France would be allowed to do, providing they had a legitimate claim to asylum. The Aquarius sparked a major diplomatic row when it was left stranded on Monday. Italy's populist coalition,external- and in particular its interior minister, the right-wing League party leader Matteo Salvini - has taken a hard-line approach to immigration and refused to let it dock. Mr Salvini says it is unfair that countries on the frontline of the EU have had to carry most of the burden of handling the migrant influx. He said Malta should accept the Aquarius, but it refused, arguing that it fell under Italian jurisdiction. Valencia's Mayor Joan Ribo, who has offered the ship a safe berth, described Italy's decision to turn the vessel away as inhuman. This video can not be played On board the Aquarius, people rest in cramped conditions He told the BBC that he hoped the city's actions would act as an ""electric shock"" and lead to reform of Europe's migration policies. Earlier, Mr Macron accused Italy of ""irresponsibility"" for turning the Aquarius away.

France 'to take in some' Aquarius migrantsSome 630 migrants aboard the Aquarius ship are due to land in Spain after being turned away by Italy.Europe,"The migrants rescued by the Aquarius have spent a week in rough seas, many suffering seasickness, while their fate is decided Spain says it has accepted an offer from France to take in some of the 630 migrants rescued by the Aquarius ship off Libya and turned away by Italy. The Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Carmen Calvo said the French government would work together with Spain to handle the arrival of the migrants. They are scheduled to dock in Valencia on Sunday. Madrid said that those migrants who expressed a wish to go to France would be allowed to do so. The fate of the ship caused a diplomatic row between Italy and France, with French President Emmanuel Macron accusing Italy of ""irresponsibility"" for turning it away. Italy, meanwhile, under its tough-talking new Prime Minister Giuseppe Conte, says it is unfair that countries on the frontline of the EU have had to carry most of the burden of handling the migrant influx. On Friday, Mr Conte and Mr Macron agreed the current system must be reformed. Reality Check: Is Italy taking in thousands of migrants? EU's Med migrant crisis: Just a mess or cynical politics?

The migrants aboard the Aquarius spent 20 hours in overcrowded rubber dinghies before being rescued by the Aquarius off the Libyan coast. They have since spent a week aboard the rescue ship in rough seas - with many aboard suffering seasickness. The migrants will be met by a team of 2,300 people, primarily health workers, when the Aquarius docks on Sunday, Efe news agency reports.

Taxi ploughs into pedestrians in MoscowVideo posted on social media shows the taxi veered onto a crowded pavement before coming to a halt.Europe,"The car came to a halt after hitting a lamppost At least eight pedestrians, including some Mexican World Cup fans, were injured after a taxi mounted a crowded pavement in central Moscow. CCTV footage posted on social media showed the car veer out of a queue of stationary traffic and accelerate into pedestrians before coming to a halt. The driver then fled, pursued by several passers-by. Moscow police said the driver was a 28-year-old national of Kyrgyzstan who had been taken into custody. They released a video of the man being questioned in which he says he had been at the wheel for more than 20 hours when the crash happened and had pressed the accelerator by mistake. ""I wanted to brake, I wanted to let someone through,"" he says, while visibly upset. ""I switched off for a second and hit the accelerator.... then I saw the people."" He said he fled because he thought the crowd of people ""were going to kill"" him. But one witness, who was across the road at the time of the crash, said it did not appear to be accidental. ""I have the feeling that he did it deliberately because he was in the traffic jam with the cars going really slowly,"" said Viktoria Geranovich, ""How could he lose control of the wheel, push the gas and drive into the crowds?"" She said ""mostly girls"" were knocked down, but people rushed to help and the ambulance arrived quickly. ""Thank god everything went well. It's scary that this happened in the very centre."" An unidentified official said of the injured: ""Seven of them are in a satisfactory condition and one woman is in a moderate condition."" The incident happened not far from the Kremlin and Red Square, an area packed with tourists. Russia is currently hosting the World Cup, and promised ""unprecedented"" security measuresin all cities hosting the games.

In a Sun on Sunday interview,external, Mr Javid said he reached for his phone to call a taxi outside Euston station when the thieves rode on to the pavement. They grabbed his phone and zoomed off, he said, which left him ""angry and upset"". He said he is now working on a review to give police more power to pursue moped thieves. ""Before I knew what was happening, it (the phone) had gone,"" said Mr Javid, who was appointed home secretary in April, becoming responsible for the UK's policing and security. Speaking of the incident, which happened a couple of years ago, he said: ""I was angry and upset but thought myself lucky not to have been stabbed or beaten up like many other victims who fall prey to these vicious criminals.""

Probe into Auschwitz row rappers droppedGerman prosecutors say Farid Bang and Kollegah's artistic freedom is guaranteed by the constitution.Europe,"Kollegah and Farid Bang later visited Auschwitz Two German rappers will not be prosecuted after an outcry over lyrics about Auschwitz and the Holocaust. Critics attacked Kollegah and Farid Bang for comparing their muscular bodies with those of Auschwitz inmates, and suggesting a new Holocaust. But prosecutors said the artistic freedom was guaranteed by the constitution. The gangsta rap lyrics, while offensive, did not amount to Holocaust denial or inciting violence, they said. DÃ¼sseldorf prosecutor's office spokesman Ralf HerrenbrÃ¼ck told German media that while the genre might be vulgar, misogynistic and homophobic, it would not be possible to bring charges. The controversy surrounding the duo centres on two lines in their latest album JBG3 (Young, brutal, good looking 3). One track includes the words:""My body is more defined than those of Auschwitz inmates."" Another has the lyric: ""I'm doing another Holocaust, coming with the Molotov."" The decision by Germany's music industry (BVMI) to hand the rappers the Echo prize in the hip-hop/urban category led to immediate condemnation from artists across the country. Music prize scrapped in Auschwitz rap row The Holocaust: Who are the missing million? Auschwitz inmate's notes from hell finally revealed The Holocaust year by year The response prompted the industry to scrap the Echo awards completely as a damaged brand. The Auschwitz memorial in southern Poland includes the site of the barracks, gas chambers and other buildings at the Auschwitz and Birkenau concentration camps, where an estimated 1.1 million people were murdered by the Nazis during the German occupation in World War Two. Most of those killed were European Jews.
