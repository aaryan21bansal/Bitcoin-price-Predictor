Anthony Joshua: What next for world heavyweight champion?,"This video can not be played I know I can knock anyone out - Joshua A glorious night answered so many questions. Anthony Joshua is the real deal. Wladimir Klitschko is far from done. Heavyweight boxing can prosper through brilliance. There was no need for insults here. Yet there will be no pause for breath after a breathless Joshua stoppage win. The questions simply evolve. Tyson Fury took mere moments to stir the pot, Deontay Wilder likewise. Will they get their shot at a man now hailed as ""the biggest sports star in Britain"" and tipped to become boxing's richest ever fighter? Listen to the thrilling finale Big-fight report by Luke Reddy at ringside Fury accepts Joshua's challenge 5 live podcast: Joshua-Klitschko reaction In stopping the most dominant heavyweight of this century in front of a record post-war UK boxing crowd - in a fight which had everything - Joshua has everywhere to go and yet nowhere to go. Matching an event as iconic as this - delivering a pay day to beat the Â£15m he was expected to earn and finding an opponent capable of competing - looks a tall order in the short-term. Yet the big names will champion their cause. ""Fury, where you at baby?"" Joshua said. The Gypsy King was busy tweeting: ""You had life and death with Klitschko, I played with the guy. Let's dance."" Former world champion Tyson Fury looks keen to fight Joshua, although he is currently suspended Joshua did hit the canvas hard before toppling Klitschko. Fury ducked, weaved and earned acomfortable points winby comparison in 2015. ""Tyson Fury will be watching that and thinking I haven't even got to lose six stone to beat AJ,"" said 5 live boxing analyst Steve Bunce. ""Could Fury have beaten AJ when he beat Klitschko? The answer is yes."" Substantially overweight anddevoid of a boxing licence,former world champion Fury will likely need time and a warm-up bout before meeting the IBF and WBA champion. WBC champion Deontay Wilder warned Joshua not to get ""comfortable"", while Klitschko confirmed he holds a rematch option, adding that he believes the champion is ""vulnerable"" at times. ""I could have done more to finish him off,"" said the 41-year-old. WBC world champion Deontay Wilder is also keen to take on Joshua The options are plentiful on paper but timing is the crucial factor. Fury will surely happen one day but not soon, meeting Klitschko swiftly before age robs him of further edge is a challenge and Wilder's lack of appeal in the UK also presents difficulty. Bunce added: ""Wilder needs at least one more fight - he is not at the pay-per-view stature yet."" Joshua connected with a huge uppercut in round 11 to end Klitschko's resistance Joshua's rise, after being all-but beaten in the sixth round, to administer a devastating uppercut and finish in the 11th, wowed the world of boxing. American viewers tuned in and lapped up the destruction. Legendary boxers Sugar Ray Leonard and Evander Holyfield were just some of those tweeting praise, while promoter Eddie Hearn believes his fighter's profile is now ""stratospheric"", adding: ""He is unquestionably world boxing's biggest star."" Hearn is just a piece in the jigsaw of a team which has made Joshua a juggernaut in world sport. His standing as a marketable asset for more than a dozen global brands brings closer his ambition to become boxing's first billionaire, while it also heaps pressure on his broad shoulders. ""The win accelerates him to be one of the world's most sought-after major properties,"" said sports marketing expert Alun James, UK chief executive at Four Sports and Sponsorships. This video can not be played 'Not perfect' Joshua plans next steps ""A YouGov survey showed 20% of the UK population have a favourable view of him. That is a very good number for boxing, which is not a mainstream sport. ""Because he's a young black man, he also allows brands to extend into demographics they haven't worked in before. He's already working with brands from Asia to the US, the UK and Dubai. ""I think he will certainly be the richest boxer ever and probably surpass Floyd Mayweather, who set the benchmark."" Klitschko is no stranger to being knocked down - he hit the deck three times in beating Samuel Peter on points in 2005 and such resistance subsequently spawned an 11-year unbeaten run until 2015. The fact Joshua has now tasted being decked and briefly humbled may well be viewed as a positive behind closed doors. No longer will doubters wonder about his heart. The world now knows what will is hidden beneath those pectorals. Joshua was knocked down for the first time in his career in the sixth round ""There comes a time where it comes from within,"" said BBC Radio 5 live pundit Richie Woodhall. ""It is DNA or whatever you want to call it. Those punches came from the depths of his soul. That is what being a world champion is all about."" This great British hope showed transitions, boxing admirably early on, taking punishment in the middle rounds, and then switching things up to power punching, seizing his moment with killer instinct. ""There were times where he showed his inexperience but he learned and showed he isn't just a prospect,"" said Joshua's trainer Rob McCracken. ""He can turn around fights and that will help him so much in his career."" Just 19 fights and now 55 rounds into his career, Joshua has every right to remain green in parts. Smiles at his opponent and celebrations after knockdowns will perhaps be stamped out. Indeed Klitschko said afterwards he felt his rival ""lost focus"" at times. In truth, the grand surroundings of Wembley are fit for a fully developed fighter. Joshua beat one, though both he and his team will admit he is not himself one yet, even if he did answer questions. ""He was raw at times which he is, and at times he was probably exposed but to get exposed in front of 90,000 people, to bite down on your gum shield, and to knock out Klitschko in the 11th round, you can't buy that heart,"" added Hearn. The chin has been tested, as has Joshua's heart, but what about the mind? Celebrities fell over themselves to engage with him within minutes of his win, A-list names on Twitter jumping on the expanding AJ bandwagon. Joshua has won all 19 of his professional victories inside the distance He handled an expectant 90,000 crowd and surely no fight to come can be bigger from a stadium perspective? Yet heavyweight boxing can provide a slap of reality. Mike Tyson ran into Buster Douglas, Lennox Lewis fell to Hasim Rahman. But the focus and creative nature of his training drills - visible in their droves on Instagram - seem to showcase a desire to keep striving and try different things in pursuit of excellence. Away from the ring, Joshua talks about different cultures in a studious way. He has a mind which seems unlikely to fall lazy and such drive will be critical. There were moments where he visibly took deep breaths when under fire from Klitschko, and expect him to find solutions in the gym. As hype and distractions mount, it is reassuring to know he finds comfort there. The champion said: ""I showed that fights are won in the gym. It gets tough and boxing isn't easy. You have to have the whole package."" With every passing punch, he looks just that.

Tony Blair's legacy 20 years on,"This video can not be played Watch: How the BBC covered this day 20 years ago On Monday, it was 20 years to the day that Tony Blair won a landslide general election victory for Labour - how did he change the country and what is left of his legacy? ""A new dawn has broken, has it not?"" With these words, spoken to a cheering crowd of supporters as the sun rose over London's South Bank, Tony Blair ushered in the first Labour government in 18 years. It was a typically snappy Blair phrase, yet also slightly hesitant, as if he could not quite believe what he had just done. Blair was, by all accounts, a nervy companion on election night, refusing to believe he was on course to a stunning victory even as it was becoming obvious to all around him. He did not share the euphoric mood of supporters. ""I was scared,"" he later wrote in his memoirs. It was a Labour landslide of historic proportions, handing Blair a Commons majority of 179, although the collapse in the Tory vote made it appear more dramatic. John Major's Conservatives had won more votes in 1992 - 14,093,007 - than Blair's 1997 total of 13,518,167. But none of that mattered to the ecstatic crowd at the Royal Festival Hall, as Blair sketched out, in vague but confident terms, his vision of a modern, united country fit for a new millennium. A country for the ""many not the few"". It is striking now to hear how much of his eight-minute speech was directed at the party's old guard. ""We have been elected as New Labour and we will govern as New Labour,"" he told his audience, as a warning shot across the bows of those who had opposed his ""modernisation"" of the party every step of the way. Blair came to power at a time of almost giddy optimism, in contrast with what was to come. The end of the Cold War and booming economies in the West, driven by advances in technology, created a brief window where peace, stability and rising living standards looked like they might become the norm. Britain was in the middle of a pop culture revival, built around swaggering self-confidence and semi-ironic celebrations of Britishness. The Union Jack was back - on Noel Gallagher's guitar and Geri Halliwell's mini dress at that year's Brit awards. The Cross of St George had also been rehabilitated, as a new breed of middle class football fan cheered England to the semi-finals of the Euro 96 tournament. Blair rode the ""Cool Britannia"" wave for all it was worth. At 43, the former lead singer of Ugly Rumours - his student band - badly wanted to be seen as the first rock and roll prime minister. And for the briefest of moments, it seemed to work, as he played host to the stars of Britain's ""creative industries"" at a Downing Street reception weeks after taking office. The voting public might have bought into New Labour's blend of Thatcherite free market economics and social justice, but it never had very deep roots in the Labour Party itself. It was the product of a tight-knit group headed by Blair, Gordon Brown, Peter Mandelson and media chief Alastair Campbell. Blair's first cabinet was a mix of old and new Labour figures (although the hard left was banished to the wilderness). ""Traditional values in a modern setting"", as John Prescott, a man who straddled the new/old divide with more agility than he was often given credit for, would say with a knowing smirk. They were a diverse bunch - with more women than had ever sat in a British cabinet before and the first openly gay cabinet minister, Chris Smith. There were some big hitters, such as Robin Cook at the Foreign Office and Jack Straw at the Home Office, even though very few - including Blair himself - had ever sat behind a ministerial desk before. And it quickly became clear that only Blair and Chancellor Gordon Brown really mattered when it came to the big decisions. But rather like Oasis's Gallagher brothers, their successes were quickly followed by growing stories about their rivalry. But despite their increasingly fractious relationship - the TBGBs as they became known - there was no official split as they dominated Britain's political landscape for the next decade. Ministers seemed to come and go with dizzying speed, as the cabinet reshuffle became Blair's signature move, but the Blair/Brown axis somehow stayed in place. Twenty years on and only three MPs - Harriet Harman, Margaret Beckett and Nick Brown - from that first Cabinet line-up are still in the Commons. Mo Mowlam, Donald Dewar and Robin Cook are no longer with us. Most of the rest, including the now Lord Prescott, Alistair Darling and David Blunkett, have taken up seats in the House of Lords. Did they achieve what they set out to do? The Blair government came to power on the back of relatively modest proposals on a pledge card brandished relentlessly through the 1997 election campaign. They were cutting class sizes, ""fast track"" punishment for young offenders, cutting NHS waiting lists, getting 250,000 under-25-year-olds ""off benefit and into work"" and ""no rise in income tax rates"". But the new government did not lack ambition. Labour's 1997 manifesto also included a minimum wage and plans for devolved government in Scotland and Wales. And on the day after their election victory, Gordon Brown surprised everyone by handing control of interest rates to the Bank of England - a move that would have far-reaching consequences for the economy. Blair was also determined, like many a prime minister before and since, to fix some of the country's longstanding social problems. One of his top priorities was reform of the UK's social security system to make work pay. He appointed Labour MP Frank Field to ""think the unthinkable"" on welfare and promptly sacked him when he did just that (although it was Field's falling out with his boss Harriet Harman that probably sealed his fate). Twenty years on and welfare reform remains a work in progress. The gap between rich and poor remained more or less the same during the Blair years,according to analysis by the Resolution Foundation,external, although there was a big increase in pay at the top end of the income scale. Education was Blair's other top priority. He oversaw a big expansion in higher and further education, and poured money into early years learning, as well as pioneering academy schools. His first term was characterised by caution on tax and public spending, thanks to Labour's commitment to stick to tight Conservative spending limits for the first two years. That changed after the party's second landslide election victory in 2001, when billions began to pour into the health service and education, on the back of a booming economy. Outcomes improved as a result. But perhaps the biggest change that happened to Britain during his time in power was never explicitly spelled out in a Labour manifesto. The UK, Sweden and the Republic of Ireland were the only EU nations not to temporarily restrict the rights of people from eight new member countries, including Poland and the Czech Republic, to live and work in their countries. Blair's 2004 decision to open the door to East European migration was entirely in keeping with his values as an ardent pro-European, who had championed the eastward expansion of the EU and who believed globalisation and flexible labour markets were the answer to industrial decline. The plentiful supply of cheap labour arguably helped the UK economy to expand without facing the issue of spiralling wages - and this in turn held inflation and interest rates down, contributing to a decade-long boom in property prices, adding to the feelgood factor among middle income home owners, even if fewer people could afford to get on the property ladder in the first place. But it also sowed the seeds of discontent in Labour's heartlands, as growing numbers felt left behind and marginalised by the pace of change in their communities, and a growing anti-EU feeling began to take hold. And then there was Iraq. In 2003, Blair had drawn on every last ounce of his persuasive skill to make the case for joining the US-led invasion to MPs and the wider public. He had become convinced of the value of military action in pursuit of humanitarian aims and the need to stand shoulder-to-shoulder with the US, in the wake of 11 September, 2001. But the subsequent failure to find weapons of mass destruction appeared to confirm many people's worst suspicions about him - that he relied too much on spin and was not to be trusted. It did not prevent him from winning a third term, in 2005, but he was forced to hand over to Gordon Brown earlier than he had wanted, in 2007. Like Mrs Thatcher in 1990, he had won three elections but ended up being forced out by his own side. The Blair family leave Downing Street in 2007 The years that followed were not kind, as the incoming Brown administration, and the Ed Miliband Labour team that followed seemed to do their best to talk down the Blair years - and then there was the Chilcot inquiry into the Iraq war, as well as the ongoing consequences of the invasion, for the region and global security as a whole. Blair's supporters point to his domestic achievements - the minimum wage and all the new schools, hospitals and Sure Start children's centres that were built during his time in power  - and they insist that his reputation will one day recover. But with Britain on its way out of the European Union, and the Labour Party back in the hands of the left, it seems like much of what Blair stood for has been swept away. His centrist brand of politics, characterised as the Third Way, a philosophy shared by his friend and political soulmate Bill Clinton, has fallen out of fashion in many Western countries and even Blair's style of politics, with its rigid emphasis on ""message discipline"", looks antiquated in the more freewheeling age of social media. And despite winning three general elections, with big majorities, making him Labour's most electorally successful leader, his name has become a dirty word among many current active party members, guaranteed to generate boos and cat calls when it comes up at meetings. It is very far from the future he must have imagined for himself on that cloudless spring morning in May 1997. Yet Blair's supporters claim that his vision of a self-consciously modern, multicultural, socially liberal country, has endured - and that David Cameron's six years in government were shaped by it. It is there in the Conservatives' commitments on foreign aid and promotion of gay rights, they say, as well as Britain's continued commitment to a health service free at the point of delivery, funded by taxation. And, at 63, the man himself is still in the game. He has ditched his business interests - that had generated so much negative publicity for him - to work full time on promoting moderate, centrist policy solutions, fighting battles that 20 years ago he must have hoped would have been won by now.

The battery story: From frogs' legs to electric cars,"Murderers in early 19th-Century London sometimes tried to kill themselves before they were hanged. Failing that, they asked friends to give their legs a good, hard pull as they dangled from the gallows to ensure their death. Their freshly hanged bodies, they knew, would be handed to scientists for anatomical studies. They didn't want to survive the hanging and regain consciousness while being dissected. If George Foster, executed in 1803, had woken up on the lab table, it would have been in particularly undignified circumstances. In front of an enthralled and slightly horrified London crowd, an Italian scientist with a flair for showmanship placed an electrode into Foster's rectum. Some onlookers thought Foster was waking up. The electrically charged probe caused his body to flinch and his fist to clench. Applied to his face, electrodes made his mouth grimace and an eye twitch open. The scientist had modestly assured his audience that he wasn't actually intending to bring Foster back to life, but added, ""Who knows what might happen?"" The police were on hand, in case Foster needed hanging again. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world we live in. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. Foster's body was being galvanised - a word coined for Luigi Galvani, the Italian scientist's uncle. In 1780s Italy, Galvani had discovered that touching the severed legs of a dead frog with two different types of metal caused the legs to jerk. Galvani thought he had discovered ""animal electricity"", and his nephew was carrying on the investigations. Galvanism briefly fascinated the public, inspiring Mary Shelley's novel, Frankenstein. Galvani discovered frogs' legs would twitch when touched by electrodes Galvani was wrong. There is no animal electricity. You can't bring hanged bodies back to life, and Victor Frankenstein's monster remains safely in the realms of fiction. But Galvani was wrong in a useful way, because he showed his experiments to his friend Alessandro Volta, who had better intuition about what was going on. The important thing, Volta realised, wasn't that the frog flesh was of animal origin. It was that it contained fluids which conducted electricity, allowing a charge to pass between the different types of metal. When the two metals connected - Galvani's scalpel touching the brass hook on which the legs were hung - the circuit was complete, and a chemical reaction caused electrons to flow. Volta experimented with different combinations of metal and different substitutes for frogs' legs. In 1800, he showed that you could generate a constant, steady current by piling up sheets of zinc, copper and brine-soaked cardboard. Alessandro Volta described his findings in a letter to the President of the Royal Society, Sir Joseph Banks, in March 1800 Volta had invented the battery, and gave us a new word - volt. His insight won him admirers. Napoleon made him a count. But it wasn't especially practical, not at first. The metals corroded, the salt water spilled, the current was short-lived, and it couldn't be recharged. It was 1859 before we got the first rechargeable battery, made from lead, lead dioxide and sulphuric acid. It was bulky, heavy, and acid sloshed out if you tipped it over. But it was useful - the same basic design still starts our cars. The first ""dry"" cells - the familiar modern battery - came in 1886. The next big breakthrough took another century. In 1985, Akira Yoshino patented the lithium-ion battery, later commercialised by Sony. Lithium was popular with researchers as it's very light and highly reactive: lithium-ion batteries can pack lots of power into a small space. Lithium-ion batteries power many popular devices. Unfortunately, lithium also has an alarming tendency to explode when exposed to air and water, so it took some clever chemistry to make it acceptably stable. Without the lithium-ion battery,mobiles would likely have been much slower to catch on. Consider what cutting-edge battery technology looked like in 1985. Motorola had just launched the world's first mobile phone, the DynaTAC 8000x. Known affectionately as ""the brick"", it weighed nearly 1kg. Its talk time was 30 minutes. Just google it: How one company came to dominate search Tick tock: The importance of knowing the right time How a razor revolutionised the way we pay for stuff Rise of the robots: What advances mean for workers The technology behind lithium-ion batteries has certainly improved: 1990s laptops were clunky and discharged rapidly. Today's sleek ultraportables will last for a long-haul flight. Still, battery life has improved at a much slower rate than other laptop components, such as memory and processing power. Where's the battery that's light and cheap, recharges in seconds, and never deteriorates with repeated use? We're still waiting. But there is no shortage of researchers looking for the next breakthrough. Some are developing ""flow"" batteries, which work by pumping charged liquid electrolytes. Harvard researchers working on ""flow"" batteries have identified a new class of organic molecules, inspired by vitamin B2, that can safely store electricity Some are experimenting with new materials to combine with lithium, including sulphur and air. Some are using nanotechnology in the wires of electrodes to make batteries last longer. But history counsels caution: game changers haven't come along often. In the coming decades, the truly revolutionary development in batteries may not be in the technology itself, but in its uses. We think of batteries as things that allow us to disconnect from the grid. We may soon see them as the thing that makes the grid work better. Gradually, the cost of renewable energy is coming down. But even cheap renewables pose a problem - they don't generate power all the time. You'll always have a glut of solar power on summer days and none on winter evenings. When the sun isn't shining and the wind isn't blowing, you need coal or gas or nuclear to keep the lights on, so why not run them all the time? Solar panels cannot deliver power all the time - even in sunny spots A recent study of south-eastern Arizona's grid weighed the costs of power cuts against the costs of CO2 emissions, and concluded that solar should provide just 20% of power.  And Arizona is pretty sunny. Grids need better ways of storing energy to better exploit renewable power. One time-honoured solution is pumping water uphill when you have spare energy, and then - when you need more - letting it flow back down through a hydropower plant. But that requires conveniently contoured terrain. Could batteries be the solution? Perhaps. It depends partly on the extent to which regulators nudge the industry in that direction, and on how quickly battery costs come down. Elon Musk hopes they'll come down very quickly indeed. The entrepreneur behind electric car maker Tesla is building a gigantic lithium-ion battery factory in Nevada. Musk claims it will be the second-largest building in the world, after the one where Boeing manufactures its 747s. Quick-charging car batteries are essential for electric cars Tesla is betting that it can significantly wrestle down the costs of lithium-ion production, not through technological breakthroughs, but through sheer economies of scale. Tesla needs the batteries for its vehicles, of course. But it's also among the companies already offering battery packs to homes, businesses and power grids. If you have solar panels on your roof, a battery in your house gives you the option of storing your surplus day-time energy for night-time use, rather than selling it back to the grid. We're still a long way from a world in which electricity grids and transport networks can operate entirely on renewables and batteries. But in the race to limit climate change, the world needs something to galvanise it into action. The biggest impact of Alessandro Volta's invention may be only just beginning.

Six child actors who quit acting,"Stranger Things is one of Netflix's most successful shows Child stars have been a crucial part of Hollywood for generations, but many of them choose totally different careers in adulthood. The second season of Netflix's hugely popular drama Stranger Things will premiere on Halloween 2017, the streaming service confirmed earlier this year. The show stars Winona Ryder and David Harbour but also relies heavily on its cast of child actors, who play some of the main characters. The young stars have been praised for their performances in the show, and could well have bright futures in Hollywood ahead of them. But the glitz and glamour of the entertainment industry isn't for everyone. For every Drew Barrymore or Jodie Foster, there are plenty of child actors who chose to go in totally different directions in their adult years. Here are six child stars who left acting behind to pursue new careers. You might not recognise the name, but Ostrum played Charlie in the big-screen adaptation of Roald Dahl's Charlie and the Chocolate Factory. The 1971 film saw Ostrum appear alongside four other child actors as one of Willy Wonka's five golden ticket winners. ""Everybody thinks that acting is such a glamorous profession, but it's a difficult profession,"" hesaid,externalafter starring in the film. That may explain why he quit acting and became a vet as an adult instead. Some of the other young actors in the film picked up a few more big screen roles in the years after the film, but nearly all drifted away from Hollywood. Michael Bollner, who played Augustus Gloop, for example, now works as an accountant in Munich. In the 1990s, it was difficult to go to the cinema without seeing a film with Mara Wilson in it. She starred in Miracle on 34th Street, Mrs Doubtfire, A Simple Wish and Matilda. But then, as she entered her teenage years, the former child actress retreated from the limelight. ""I was 13 and I was awkward, and I was gawky, and I was not a very cute kid anymore,"" Wilson toldThe Huffington Post,externalin 2013. ""So, Hollywood didn't really want me at that point, and I was kind of over it too. So, after a while, it feels like a mutual breakup. That's the way that I'd describe it."" Wilson is now a writer and released a book last year called Where Am I Now? She also came out as bisexual in support of the victims of theattackon an LGBT nightclub in Orlando. Harper Lee's novel To Kill A Mockingbird was an instant literary phenomenon when it was first released in 1960, and is still considered a classic. When the inevitable big-screen adaptation was made, Mary Badham was hired to play the role of Scout, the young girl who serves as the book's narrator. Badham became the youngest actress ever nominated for the best supporting actress category at the Oscars after her appearance in the film (although the record was broken a decade later by the marginally younger Tatum O'Neal). She went on to act in a few other films released in the 1960s, but then gave up on the profession for the rest of her life - with one exception. Badham was coaxed out of retirement for a minor role in one film - 2005's Our Very Own - after its director, Cameron Watson, said he wouldn't accept any other actress for the part. She now works an art restorer and a college testing coordinator, but oftenwrites,externalabout her experiences on Mockingbird and attended a special screening of the film with President Obama in 2012. ""When I retired, I was at an in-between age. I wasn't a child anymore, I wasn't really a woman yet and they weren't really writing scripts for that age,"" shesaid,externallater that year. Not many of us can claim to have started our career at the age of three - but that's exactly what Shirley Temple did. As a child actress, she starred in a whole host of films, including Bright Eyes, The Little Princess, Heidi and Captain January. But in her adult years, she entered politics and public affairs, becoming a Republican fundraiser and serving three years as the United States Ambassador to (what was then known as) Czechoslovakia. She also had a mocktail named after her - which, thank you for asking, consists of ginger ale (or lemonade) and a splash of grenadine, garnished with a maraschino cherry. When Temple died in 2014 at the age of 85, she left behind a remarkable legacy - no child star since has ever come close to equalling her record of being Hollywood's top box office star for four years in a row. Mark Lester was just 10 years old when he was cast as Oliver in, er, Oliver. The film adaptation of the stage musical was released in 1968 - more than 130 years after Charles Dickens's novel Oliver Twist was first published. Lester took various roles over the following decade but decided to give up acting at the age of 19 and became an osteopath. ""Child actors going on to become adult actors never really works, apart from a few. Jodie Foster was the exception,"" hetold,externalThe Independent. He and Michael Jackson - who was born in the same year - were close friends, and Lester became godfather to the singer's three children. Richards took on a few small acting jobs throughout her childhood, but shot to fame playing Lex Murphy in 1993's Jurassic Park - a role she filmed when she was just 12 years old. She briefly reprised the role for The Lost World: Jurassic Park four years later, but then took a step back from acting to focus on her art career. Richards graduated in 2001 with a degree in fine art and drama and went on to become a successful painter. But, in 2011, shesaid,external: ""Being interested in acting never changes. Acting is in your blood, and of course I'll always be interested in it."" Which explains why she was briefly tempted back in 2013 for a role in TV movie Battledogs.

The man who can arrange anything,"Aaron Simpson's company helps its clients arrange many aspects of their lives If you were ever worried that your loved one might reject your marriage proposal, spare a thought for one romantic Saudi national. The man had hired the Egyptian pyramids, and flown in 300 friends and family members to watch while he popped the question in front of the ancient structures. With a lavish private party then due to be held at the site, which was sealed off from locals and other visitors, the cost was an eye-watering $40m (Â£31m). Thankfully for the individual, his girlfriend said ""yes"". When it comes to marriage proposals, this example takes largesse to the nth degree. But even if you have  the cash, how the heck would you go about organising such an event? Other party venues are available The answer for the Saudi man was simply to phone his concierge services provider, a UK business called Quintessentially. ""We made it happen,"" says Quintessentially's chief executive and co-founder Aaron Simpson. For those of us that aren't millionaires or billionaires, the concierge services industry needs a little explaining. Taking its name from the man or woman at posh hotels who can book guests theatre tickets and get them into top restaurants, the sector has discreetly grown up over the past 15 or so years. Quintessentially organises luxury holidays for its clients - among many other services And far from just securing tickets for the latest sell-out play, or a table at some hotshot chef's new venture, concierge firms are being used to organise many aspects of clients' lives. At Quintessentially, which has 60 offices around the world, and 2,500 members of staff, it does everything from organising holidays, to advising clients about private schools, helping buy properties, arranging private concerts by pop stars, or booking a dog walker. And then there is the weird and wonderful stuff, such as making a client a bouquet of ""flowers"" made from 100 folded 1,000 Hong Kong dollar notes, so he could give it to his partner on Valentine's Day. Or covering an entire beach with carpets so a member and his girlfriend didn't have to get sand on their feet, and organising a flash mob in New York's Times Square. The firm is one of the largest in the sector, and while Quintessentially doesn't reveal its client numbers or price details, it is estimated to have about 100,000 customers around the world, including 800 billionaires who pay up to Â£150,000 a year. The company has arranged for Elton John to give private concerts Mr Simpson, 45, says that the firm's 2,500 employees, known as ""lifestyle managers"", can, generally speaking, make anything happen. ""We can arrange most things - unless of course it is illegal or there is a moral objection to it, and that very rarely happens - perhaps once or twice a year,"" he says. ""But otherwise everything is pretty solvable."" Born and bred in Essex, after studying geography at Oxford University, Mr Simpson spent his early 20s working as a film producer. But given the continuing weakness of the UK film industry, by age 27 he was looking for a change of career. Quintessentially staff can advise on art investments After brainstorming sessions with friends Ben Elliot and Paul Drummond, they came up with the idea for Quintessentially. Securing investment from a group of private investors, the business was launched in London in 2000 with a party to which they invited more than 200 movers and shakers. Customer numbers then grew strongly thanks to positive word of mouth. While Quintessentially won't reveal any members' details, it is widely reported that it is used by the likes of singer Madonna, Indian steel giant Lakshmi Mittal, UK entrepreneur Richard Branson, author JK Rowling and rap star P Diddy. The company also works closely with 400 premium brands including Ferrari, Channel, Gucci and British Airways. In addition to running ""white label"" concierge services for such companies, Quintessentially has expanded its operations in recent years to helping firms with their public relations and marketing, and assisting them in studying customer data to best plan new products and services. Mr Simpson says that the company now enjoys an annual turnover of Â£150m, and he intends to continue to grow this. He adds that despite numerous suitors, he and his two co-founders have no plans to sell up. The three founder are (left to right), Ben Elliot, Aaron Simpson and Paul Drummond Alyssa Haak, a New York-based luxury lifestyle expert, says that Quintessentially and other concierge firms have grown in popularity among the world elite because the ease of having someone else book or arrange things for you is ""too good to pass up"". However, she is sceptical of one forthcoming Quintessentially project; its plans to build a 250m euro ($272m; Â£211m) ""super yacht"" for members. Due to launch in three years time, the floating private club will be 220m (722ft) long and have 100 rooms, as well as a nightclub, bars and numerous restaurants. Quintessentially's aim is to move it around the world to places where demand for hotel rooms is likely to exceed those locally available, such as Monaco when it is hosting the Formula 1 Grand Prix, or Cannes during the city's film festival. Ms Haak says: ""I'm really very sceptical of it for a few reasons... there have been a number of firms that have attempted to do yacht 'shares' that have slowly disappeared. ""Yachts are personal, even those that are built with chartering in mind block out the dates the owners want to use them. ""Finally, and I think its biggest problem is going to be dockage... a yacht this size will never be able to get 'front row seats'."" While the three co-founders still run Quintessentially together, Mr Simpson has the boss role, although he says the three men simply ""play to their strengths"", and he ""doesn't necessarily see myself as the leader"". Quintessentially is launching a ""super yacht"" in three years' time He admits, though, to always having been very driven to succeed in life, but says he hopes that he is a good boss ""who puts his colleagues first"". Travelling extensively for the company over the years, overseeing the opening of new offices around the world, Mr Simpson says that since having children - he and his wife have two young daughters - he now tries to travel far less. ""I have a three-line whip to stay within shouting range,"" he says.

Keeping the Ayrton Senna brand and legacy alive,"This video can not be played The Ayrton Senna Foundation is helping millions of students in Brazil Twenty-three years after his death, former Formula 1 world champion Ayrton Senna's name is almost as valuable as when he was alive - and it is making a difference in his home country of Brazil. It is Friday afternoon and children around the age of 12 are gathered in the computer lab of a public school in Itatiba, a small town an hour away from Sao Paulo. Class time is already over for the week, but these students have chosen to stay in school for extracurricular activities. They are learning Scratch, a piece of software developed by MIT experts that aims to teach kids how to code. Most public schools in Brazil don't have computer coding in their curriculum. In fact, most schools are struggling to get kids to learn the basics, such as maths and Portuguese, as Brazil ranks among the worst countries in the world in school exams. The coding class is courtesy of the Ayrton Senna Foundation Students and staff in Itatiba have little interest in Formula 1. But much of what is going on in the classroom is part of the legacy of legendary driver Ayrton Senna, killed in a tragic accident during the San Marino Grand Prix on 1 May 1994. The coding class is a project run by the Ayrton Senna Foundation, a non-governmental organisation (NGO) that was founded by Ayrton's sister Viviane a few months after his death. Most of the money for the Foundation comes from managing Senna's brand and legacy. Ayrton Senna is still one of the most valuable sporting brands in the world. Senna is still a beloved figure in Brazil In the past five years, the foundation drew in about 1bn Brazilian reais (Â£250m; $320m) for the NGO. And it's all a family affair. While Viviane is the CEO of the foundation, her daughter Bianca is head of branding. The foundation uses the money it raises to fund ambitious educational projects, which are today its core business. ""Usually companies have a philanthropic arm that helps society with social projects. We are the other way around. We are the only NGO I know that has a sports branding company inside it,"" says Bianca. Ayrton Senna is still a goldmine in terms of marketing. ""We're an NGO with a sports branding company inside it,"" says Ayrton's niece Bianca Senna The strongest markets for Senna products are Brazil, the UK and Italy. Research conducted in 2015 by the Boston Consulting Group suggests Senna is in the same league as tennis superstar Roger Federer and basketball legend Michael Jordan in terms of product endorsement potential. Another survey of Brazilian athletes who competed in last year's Rio Olympics - many of them too young to have seen Senna race - ranked him as their biggest source of inspiration, above past and present idols such as Neymar and Pele. The foundation does its best to fully explore the marketing potential, licensing hundreds of products with Senna's face and name on it. It caters for two groups of consumers. The first are Formula 1 fans who buy products such as books, DVDs, helmets and collectible souvenirs. The foundation licenses hundreds of Ayrton Senna-themed items, like these action figures And then there are products for the general public who may not necessarily enjoy racing, but like Senna for his charisma and values. These include toys and comic books for children and a food line of ketchup, mustard and mayonnaise. Marketing specialist Marcos Machado, from TopBrands Consultancy, says Senna's tragic death while at the top of his game crystallised his image in the eyes of the public as a winner. Most sports stars eventually lose their appeal when they get older and retire. Some devalue their own brands by getting involved in scandals - thinkRyan LochteandTiger Woods,external. ""If you consider Senna as a brand, I don't think he has many competitors,"" says Machado. World champion three times - in 1988, 1990 and 1991 161 grand prix starts 41 wins 65 pole positions First race - 1984 Brazilian GP First win - 1985 Portugese GP Last win - 1993 Australian GP Last race - 1994 San Marino GP F1's greatest drivers: Ayrton Senna One of the brand's strengths is that virtually all money from licensing goes to charity, not profit. Education is the foundation's core business. Over the past two decades, it has become one of the biggest NGOs in Brazil, helping 1.9 million children and training 60,000 teachers per year. Senna's name is also used for a range of foodstuffs including mustard, mayonnaise and ketchup It invests heavily in research to come up with what Viviane Senna calls ""vaccines"" - smart solutions that can be applied to many schools with low costs. Last year it achieved one of its greatest successes in Colegio Chico Anysio, a public school in Rio de Janeiro with students from low-income families. The institute revamped the curriculum, training students in social and emotional skills such as resilience, discipline and determination, instead of focusing solely on traditional subjects, such as maths and languages. It even came up with special metrics to identify these skills. And in the national students' exam, Colegio Chico Anysio was ranked the fifth best school for its income level. The foundation aims for low-cost solutions that can work in many schools, says Viviane Senna This year the institute is applying its ""vaccine"" to 20 other schools in the south of Brazil. Its work does not come without criticism, though. Teachers' unions complain that social and emotional skills are personal traits - not skills to be measured - and that the foundation sees schools and teachers too much as enterprises. Viviane Senna disagrees. ""If someone from the 19th Century travelled to our time, he wouldn't see any difference in classrooms. But the rest of the world has been through a technological and scientific revolution. ""And it's not just about bringing tablets and mobiles into students' hands. It's about giving them social and emotional skills to face our world."" Despite some successes, Brazil's level of education has been slipping recently in the Programme for International Student Assessment (Pisa) global rankings. Brazil has 50 million children in school, aged between six and 16. Only one in five end up graduating from high school. All others are lost along the way. Keeping interest in Ayrton Senna's name is likely to get harder as the years go by The future is fraught with challenges for the foundation. All the work it does with schools needs to be approved by state and city governments, but public finances are collapsing in Brazil thanks to the recession. On the branding front, it must keep the interest in Senna's name alive, a task that is likely to get harder as years go by. ""The foundation has done outstanding work. And interest in Senna can be sustained, but not forever,"" says Mr Machado. ""We have to be realistic. One day, Senna is going to be more of a distant memory than a real idol for young generations. You can keep his name alive, but not forever."" On the racetrack, Ayrton Senna made a name for himself as a driver who could do things that seemed impossible. The foundation that now carries his name is trying to live up to that legacy.

Farron says he is 'bit of a Eurosceptic',"This video can not be played Lib Dem leader Tim Farron: ""The prime minister is heading for a colossal coronation on 8 June"" Liberal Democrat leader Tim Farron has described himself as a ""bit of a Eurosceptic"" despite his party's pro-EU stance. Mr Farron cited his 2008 resignation from the Lib Dem front bench because he wanted a referendum on the Lisbon Treaty. But he said only the Lib Dems could prevent the ""calamity of hard Brexit"". The party is aiming to attract the votes of people who backed Remain in June's EU referendum. Live: General election latest May: Tories won't raise VAT General election: What you need to know Election deals, pacts and alliances explained Speaking on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show, he made a pitch for voters in former Lib Dem heartlands in the South West, where many people voted to leave the European Union. ""I don't want to go off on a little bit of a rabbit hole here, but you will remember that I resigned from the Liberal Democrat front bench about 10 years ago because I am a bit of a Eurosceptic,"" he said. ""I'm somebody who challenges people in power - the EU, in government, in councils - but I am somebody who believes Britain is better off in the European Union."" He also said he admired ex-prime minister Tony Blair for his electoral success, and claimed that Labour was now too divided to focus on the election. Reiterating that there would be no Lib Dem coalition with Labour, he said a Conservative majority after the 8 June general election was ""not in question"" and that Mrs May was heading for a ""colossal coronation"" - making questions about party pacts meaningless. ""We're determined to turn the coronation she expects into a contest that Britain desperately needs,"" he added. Labour said the Lib Dems could not be trusted, pointing to the party's promise not to raise tuition fees - a stance it abandoned in coalition government.

The signs this could be a tactical election,"The 2017 general election looks set to see more co-operation between political parties than ever before. The Liberal Democrats, Greens, UKIP, DUP and UUP have all said they'll stand aside in at least one constituency. There won't be national deals though. Co-operation will be limited to local agreements. And it's difficult to be sure how big the impact will be. Britain's first-past-the-post electoral system means that lots of MPs are elected on fewer than half of the votes cast in their constituencies. At the last election, 333 out of 650 winning candidates received less than 50% of the vote. Those MPs could have been defeated if all the people who voted against them had gone for the same alternative candidate. Clearly, that would never happen everywhere. But parties who agree on some of the main issues potentially have a lot to gain if they can co-ordinate their supporters. The Greens are keen to forge alliances One option is to encourage tactical voting. A more direct approach is to enter some sort of alliance or pact which sees parties choosing not to put forward candidates in certain seats. Even without an agreement, parties can try to affect the result simply by choosing not to contest some constituencies. There's going to be more co-ordination of this kind in 2017 than we've seen at previous elections. As a strategy, though, it does rely on voters being prepared to vote for a candidate from a party which would not have been their first choice. One part of the country where electoral deals have been used before is Northern Ireland. In 2015, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) and Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) agreed a pact not to stand against each other in four constituencies: Belfast North, Belfast East, Fermanagh & South Tyrone, and Newry & Armagh. The deal was pretty successful. The unionist candidate won in three of the four seats. And the Sinn Fein majority was halved in Newry and Armagh. General election: What you need to know The seats that could decide the election This year, the UUP have said they won't put up candidates in Belfast North, Belfast West and Foyle. And the DUP won't stand in Fermanagh & South Tyrone once again. The parties have held discussions about the possibility of extending the pact but without agreement so far. There's also been talk of an ""anti-Brexit alliance"" which could include the main nationalist parties, Sinn Fein and the SDLP. But that plan now looks unlikely after the Green Party leader, Steven Agnew, said they wouldn't take part. In the rest of the UK, this kind of deal has been very rare in recent years but it looks as though there will be more co-operation between parties this time. One reason is Brexit. It's a crucial issue for all of the parties and, significantly, an issue which cut across parties but cleanly divided voters into two camps. Philip Hollobone has done a deal with UKIP UKIP leader Paul Nuttall said he would put ""country before party"" by not standing candidates in some seats where there is a strongly pro-Brexit MP or where a pro-Brexit candidate has a chance of ousting a pro-Remain MP. UKIP are standing aside in Christchurch and Bournemouth West. In Kettering, they've gone further by reaching a ""memorandum of understanding"" with Conservative MP Philip Hollobone. The deal includes plans for a regular forum where Mr Hollobone will meet UKIP members if he's re-elected. On the other side of the debate, former Prime Minister Tony Blair has also said that he was prepared to ""work with anyone"" to stop candidates who back ""Brexit at any cost"" although he didn't suggest a formal electoral pact. Brexit isn't the only issue. The Green Party is seeking support for what they call a ""progressive alliance"". Co-leaders Caroline Lucas and Jonathan Bartley have written to Labour and the Liberal Democrats calling for a meeting ""to discuss ways to beat the Tories at the general election and deliver a fairer voting system"". That's been rebuffed at a national level but in some places local parties have decided to co-operate. Liberal Democrats in Brighton agreed to stand aside in the Greens' only seat - Brighton Pavilion. Former Lib Dem MP, Sir Vince Cable, who is seeking re-election, had tweeted his support for the idea. The Greens have also unilaterally decided not to contest Labour-held Ealing Central and Acton and Brighton Kemptown, just as they did at the Richmond Park by-election in December where the Lib Dems overturned Zac Goldsmith's 23,000 majority. Some Labour figures are calling on the party to respond in kind, stepping down Labour candidates in two seats - Brighton Pavilion and the Isle of Wight - where the Greens could win. In an open letter from members including MPs Clive Lewis, Jon Cruddas and Tulip Siddiq,published in the Guardian,external, they said it was ""important to maximise progressive votes"" in order to avoid ""the danger of a Tory landslide."" They've also suggested a deal which would see them stand aside in Plymouth Sutton and Devonport if Labour returned the favour in Totnes. All of this negotiating will only be worth it if voters are prepared to back a party that isn't their first choice. There can be no guarantee that the Green voters will agree to switch en masse to the Labour candidate if the Greens stand aside. The evidence from Northern Ireland is that pacts can work. But in that case they're based on a long-established division between unionist and nationalist voters. In the rest of the country it's harder to split the parties into two blocs so neatly. However, voters do not identify as strongly with individual parties as they did in the past so there is probably more scope than previously for switching between parties. And Brexit may well give voters a reason to vote for a candidate from a party that they wouldn't previously have considered.

Champion Joshua has intoxicating appeal,"This video can not be played I know I can knock anyone out - Joshua A glorious night answered so many questions. Anthony Joshua is the real deal. Wladimir Klitschko is far from done. Heavyweight boxing can prosper through brilliance. There was no need for insults here. Yet there will be no pause for breath after a breathless Joshua stoppage win. The questions simply evolve. Tyson Fury took mere moments to stir the pot, Deontay Wilder likewise. Will they get their shot at a man now hailed as ""the biggest sports star in Britain"" and tipped to become boxing's richest ever fighter? Listen to the thrilling finale Big-fight report by Luke Reddy at ringside Fury accepts Joshua's challenge 5 live podcast: Joshua-Klitschko reaction In stopping the most dominant heavyweight of this century in front of a record post-war UK boxing crowd - in a fight which had everything - Joshua has everywhere to go and yet nowhere to go. Matching an event as iconic as this - delivering a pay day to beat the Â£15m he was expected to earn and finding an opponent capable of competing - looks a tall order in the short-term. Yet the big names will champion their cause. ""Fury, where you at baby?"" Joshua said. The Gypsy King was busy tweeting: ""You had life and death with Klitschko, I played with the guy. Let's dance."" Former world champion Tyson Fury looks keen to fight Joshua, although he is currently suspended Joshua did hit the canvas hard before toppling Klitschko. Fury ducked, weaved and earned acomfortable points winby comparison in 2015. ""Tyson Fury will be watching that and thinking I haven't even got to lose six stone to beat AJ,"" said 5 live boxing analyst Steve Bunce. ""Could Fury have beaten AJ when he beat Klitschko? The answer is yes."" Substantially overweight anddevoid of a boxing licence,former world champion Fury will likely need time and a warm-up bout before meeting the IBF and WBA champion. WBC champion Deontay Wilder warned Joshua not to get ""comfortable"", while Klitschko confirmed he holds a rematch option, adding that he believes the champion is ""vulnerable"" at times. ""I could have done more to finish him off,"" said the 41-year-old. WBC world champion Deontay Wilder is also keen to take on Joshua The options are plentiful on paper but timing is the crucial factor. Fury will surely happen one day but not soon, meeting Klitschko swiftly before age robs him of further edge is a challenge and Wilder's lack of appeal in the UK also presents difficulty. Bunce added: ""Wilder needs at least one more fight - he is not at the pay-per-view stature yet."" Joshua connected with a huge uppercut in round 11 to end Klitschko's resistance Joshua's rise, after being all-but beaten in the sixth round, to administer a devastating uppercut and finish in the 11th, wowed the world of boxing. American viewers tuned in and lapped up the destruction. Legendary boxers Sugar Ray Leonard and Evander Holyfield were just some of those tweeting praise, while promoter Eddie Hearn believes his fighter's profile is now ""stratospheric"", adding: ""He is unquestionably world boxing's biggest star."" Hearn is just a piece in the jigsaw of a team which has made Joshua a juggernaut in world sport.

What next for 'worn-down' Moyes?,"This video can not be played Moyes 'feels' for Sunderland fans after relegation It was only four years ago that David Moyes was hand-picked by retiring Manchester United manager Sir Alex Ferguson to succeed him at Old Trafford after 26 years and 38 trophies - now his career and reputation has hit rock-bottom with relegation at Sunderland. Moyes has endured a torrid and humiliating fall from grace after being deemed worthy of Ferguson's personal seal of approval to take on Manchester United in 2013 after 11 years of reliable and stable work at Everton. The manager labelled ""The Chosen One"" on a banner draped from the Stretford End was out of his depth and sacked after 10 months, the end coming after a defeat at Everton that meant United would not qualify for the Champions League for the first time in 19 years. Moyes moved abroad to restore his good managerial name but was sacked after a year at La Liga side Real Sociedad - and his return to the Premier League with Sunderland has been an unrelenting nightmare. Too soon to commit to Sunderland - Moyes Shearer: I fear for relegated Sunderland Listen as fans react to Sunderland's relegation on 606 In the past 10 years, Sunderland have spent more time in the Premier League's bottom three than any other club. Wigan Athletic, on 590 days, are the nearest to them Moyes was a well-received appointment at the Stadium Of Light in July in succession to Sam Allardyce, who rescued the Black Cats from relegation before his brief, inglorious reign as England manager. The Scot was seen as a safe choice, a man with a point to prove after failures at United and Real Sociedad, and a manager boasting the sort of track record that suggested he was a decent fit to lift perennial Premier League strugglers. At Everton, he was regarded as capable of getting a team to punch above its weight. Survival would have been seen as success at Sunderland, a situation seemingly suited to his instincts. In 11 years at Goodison Park, Moyes had only finished outside the top 10 twice, guided Everton to fifth twice and defied the odds in remarkable fashion to take the Toffees into the Champions League qualifiers after finishing fourth in 2004-05. Moyes, strangely in the eyes of some, departed without mourning among many Everton supporters who felt his attitude was too negative, not helped by a record that saw no Premier League away wins at Manchester United, Chelsea, Arsenal or Liverpool during his entire reign. Everton were beaten 2-1 by an under-strength Liverpool team in the 2012 FA Cup semi-final at Wembley He was also portrayed as a manager who came up short on the big occasions, the 2009 FA Cup final loss to Chelsea, the 2012 semi-final defeat by under-strength Liverpool at Wembley and a hapless 3-0 quarter-final loss to struggling Wigan Athletic at Goodison Park in 2013 being prime examples. These perceived failings have been underscored by recent failures. If Sunderland fans were looking for an upbeat message when Moyes arrived, they were to be sadly mistaken whenhe flagged up a season-long relegation fightafter only his second game in charge, a 2-1 home loss to Middlesbrough. Asked about supporters fearing a season-long struggle, he said: ""Well, they would probably be right."" Realism is one thing - negativity and defeatism is another. This was a message that was badly received by Sunderland's fans and set the tone for a season that turned into a long, slow, painful, joyless march into the Championship. It was also a message delivered with 10 days of the August transfer window remaining, hardly enticing words to potential new signings. And, damningly, it became a self-fulfilling prophecy as Moyes was unable to do anything to defy his own ominous predictions for Sunderland's season. The rot may well have already set in before Moyes uttered those ill-fated words but when fans and players looked to the new manager for leadership and inspiration, that would only have made matters worse. The Black Cats fans did not expect Moyes to reach for the stars but the cloak of conservatism was a poor fit. Moyes was always regarded as cautious in the transfer market at Everton, which was perfectly understandable given the financial restraints he operated within. He knew if he spent and wasted precious transfer cash he was unlikely to get it back. It saw him saddled with a ""Dithering Davie"" tag by some because of his desire to get every deal and detail right, and it was a nickname he knew all about. This video can not be played Sunderland relegation a 'terrible' feeling He could answer by outlining how his meticulous approach saw him bring bargain-priced gems to Goodison Park such as Tim Cahill for Â£2m from Millwall, Phil Jagielka for Â£4m from Sheffield United, Joleon Lescott from Wolves for Â£5m, Mikel Arteta for Â£2m from Real Sociedad - and the inspired signing of young Irish full-back Seamus Coleman from Sligo Rovers for only Â£60,000. The Scot had lost that sure touch by the time he turned up at Sunderland. Moyes was restricted by a relatively small transfer budget and an owner in Ellis Short who wants to sell the club, but his dealings smacked of conservatism and suggested he was not prepared to broaden his horizons beyond the familiar. It led to accusations he was putting the old band back together from Everton as Steven Pienaar arrived from Goodison Park after being released following lengthy injury problems. And the Everton old boys continued to pitch up, striker Victor Anichebe signed after being released by West Bromwich Albion, veteran defender Lescott after his contract was cancelled by AEK Athens and January's Â£8m double deal with the Merseyside club for Darron Gibson and Bryan Oviedo. None were a success. Moyes would suggest it was simply the market he was forced to work in but the policy of going with what he knew failed dismally, while big-money signings such as Â£13.6m Didier Ndong from Lorient and Papy Djilobodji, signed for Â£8m after flopping at Chelsea, also failed to deliver. As Sunderland took root at the foot of the Premier League, the toxic combination of apathy and anger set in and Moyes then made headlines for the wrong reasons when he reacted to a question from BBC reporter Vicki Sparks about the presence of owner Short at a game adding pressure by replying she ""might get a slap, even though you're a woman."" On WednesdayMoyes was charged by the FA,citing his remarks as ""improper and/or threatening and/or brought the game into disrepute"". Two sackings and a relegation on from his Old Trafford appointment, the Sunderland season is another black mark on his CV. Sunderland last finished in the top 10 of the Premier League under Steve Bruce in 2010-11 Moyes is the manager who has taken Sunderland into the Championship - but wasn't someone going to do it eventually at a club suffering from diminishing returns and increasingly reduced circumstances? Paolo Di Canio, Gus Poyet, Dick Advocaat and Sam Allardyce all had to engineer escapes from relegation as owner Short shuffled his managers to keep Sunderland in the Premier League. Sunderland last finished in the top 10 (10th to be precise) under Steve Bruce in 2010-11. Since then it has been a miserable diet of struggle and mediocrity that has finally ended in the drop. Were Sunderland right to stand by Moyes? 2011-12 Steve Bruce sacked, replaced by Martin O'Neill Survived 2012-13 O'Neill sacked, replaced by Paolo di Canio Survived 2013-14 Di Canio sacked, replaced by Gus Poyet Survived 2014-15 Poyet sacked, replaced by Dick Advocaat Survived 2015-16 Advocaat resigns, replaced by Sam Allardyce Survived 2016-17 David Moyes replaces Allardyce before season Relegated As Aston Villa eventually found out, there is only so long you can flirt with relegation before you end up in the full-blown embrace of the Championship. Moyes has had to contend with a hierarchy whose desire to sell reduced ambition and created an air of resignation and stagnation. He, crucially, acted in a way that fell into line with that mood but others must also take responsibility for Sunderland's decline. Sunderland were only going to get away with survival for so long barring a radical change of policy or new owners - many will see the consequences of thathome defeat by Bournemouthas simply a price paid for years of mismanagement on and off the pitch. Sunderland have won only five league games this season When Newcastle United were relegated at the end of last season, manager Rafael Benitez was regarded as blameless and the man who would take them back up. The Toon Army pleaded with him to stay and owner Mike Ashley to keep him. Newcastle will now swap places with their rivals - but Moyes enjoys none of the goodwill and optimism showered on Benitez. Indeed, Sunderland's fans have turned on the manager they believe has appeared to publicly accept the Black Cats' fate for months. It would be a very hard sell to Sunderland's fans to keep him in charge. The reputation won with his work at Everton has been eroded by failure in his three subsequent posts. The Scot may well wish to stay in charge of Sunderland as a Championship club because that is likely to be as good as it now gets for a manager who was coveted throughout his time at Everton for shrewdness, stability and motivational acumen. Moyes was linked with the Celtic vacancy, as he has been often before, last summer but Brendan Rodgers was eventually appointed and even the safety net of a move back to a big club in his native Scotland now looks to have passed him by. In 427 league games at Everton, he won 173 for a win ratio of 40.5%. He won exactly half of his 34 league matches at Manchester United but at Sunderland he has only won five out of 34, just 14.7%. Moyes regards himself as a fighter but this season he has looked worlds away from the fired-up, intense touchline operator who made his way at Preston North End and moved on to Everton. He has looked world-weary, by-passed in the Premier League by a younger generation such as Eddie Howe at Bournemouth and Marco Silva at Hull City, a worn-down figure struggling to find the powers he could call upon in the past. He was once a symbol of that emerging group but his recent record makes him damaged goods. Moyes could not rouse his players and looked to be struggling to rouse himself. Has he got the desire to try and rebuild Sunderland and his own reputation from the lower divisions? Leon Osman, a stalwart of his Everton dressing room during his years at Goodison Park, made a telling observation as he remarked to BBC Radio 5 live after the midweek loss at Middlesbrough: ""He even sounds resigned and defeated in his voice at the moment. ""I have worked with him when he had a lot of fire in his belly and you could see it in his eyes. A caller has told us he was sitting down and letting Robbie Stockdale do the talking. ""When I played under him, David Moyes was the one on the sidelines. David Moyes was the one with his eyes popping out of his head, screaming and pointing at you. At the moment he seems to be taking a backward step."" Moyes was hurt by his failure, and indeed his treatment, at Old Traffordwhen a six-year contract was cut spectacularly short.He was unsuccessful in his short-lived move to Spain and now has suffered the ignominy of relegation. Have the fires of passion that drove him before the torture of his time at Manchester United been extinguished? Is the 54-year-old suddenly a manager out of his time, still reliant on tried and trusted methods and a transfer strategy that have been overtaken? Moyes is a proud manager who stands by his record throughout his career, despite the recent downturn. He is now, however, a manager who must rebuild his badly damaged stature in the Championship - if he gets the chance. The fall from grace is complete.
