Cardi B wins case over 'degrading' YouTube videos,"Cardi B has won an injunction forcing a YouTuber to delete and never repost defamatory videos about her. It comes a few months after the rapperwon a Â£2m lawsuitagainst Latasha Kebe, known online as Tasha K. In a court document seen by Radio 1 Newsbeat, a judge has now ordered Kebe to remove over 20 videos. The singer, known for hits including I Like It, Money and WAP, was subjected to a ""malicious campaign"" of false accusations by Kebe. Kebe hosts gossip site UnWineWithTashaK which has one million subscribers. During the trial, lawyers for the singer, whose real name is Belcalis Marlenis AlmÃ¡nzar, said Kebe had waged ""a campaign to damage and destroy [Cardi B's] reputation among her fans and the consuming public"". Kebe has to take down 21 videos in the next five days from her YouTube and social media channels. In the original case, Cardi B's lawyers said Kebe started making ""degrading and harassing statements"" in early 2018 and continued to do so, at one point falsely claiming the star had worked as a prostitute. A judge has now banned Kebe from making certain statements about Cardi B's sexual health and personal life. The judge stated that both sides had agreed to the terms of the ""permanent injunction"". Cardi B's lawyers said the comments and videos on Kebe's channel caused the singer ""embarrassment, humiliation, mental anguish, and emotional distress"". What you might not know about Cardi B Kids, Cardi and cosmetic surgery Following a trial in January, a jury in the state of Georgia sided with Cardi B, holding Kebe liable for defamation, false light, and intentional infliction of emotional distress. In total, Kebe was ordered to pay Cardi B just over Â£3m in damages and legal fees. Kebe is currently appealing the original verdict, and if the appeals court overturns that decision, this injunction would also be revoked.

"Government adviser quits in conversion therapy rowLGBT business champion Iain Anderson says he has ""no choice"" but to resign with a ""heavy heart"".UK","The government's LGBT+ business champion has resigned over the decision not to ban conversion therapy for transgender people. Iain Anderson said he had ""no choice"" but to tender his resignation with a ""heavy heart"". He had been appointed to focus on workplace equality for LGBT people. The government said it had a proud record on LGBT rights and thanked Mr Anderson for his work. It previously said it would consider the issue of transgender conversion therapy further. In his resignation letter to the prime minister, Mr Anderson called for ""tolerance and respect"". He wrote: ""So many LGBT+ people continue to face violence and discrimination, but politics which creates dividing lines between LGB people and trans people will never be my approach. ""Now - more than ever - we need tolerance and respect in our national conversations."" He added: ""Trust and belief in the government's overall commitment to LGBT+ rights has been damaged. I believe a comprehensive plan to support LGBT+ people to play their full part in our society is urgently needed."" Mr Anderson wasappointed in September last year,externalas the UK's first ever LGBT+ business champion, with a focus on reducing workplace discrimination. The role was launched by the government in the lead-up to the UK's first international LGBT+ conference - named Safe To Be Me - and is an unpaid, non-political role. It was thought the position would focus on creating a network of business people to share best practice on LGBT equality in the workplace and was set to last for an initial 18-month period. The government said: ""We thank Iain for his contributions as LGBT business champion. The government has a proud record on LGBT rights and we remain committed to building upon that work with sensitivity and care."" What is conversion therapy? According to NHS England, conversion therapy tries to change someone's sexual orientation or gender identity. The government had promised to outlaw the practice butannounced last weekany ban would only apply to attempts to alter a person's sexuality, not attempts to try to change people's gender identity. A spokesperson said the government would carry out ""separate work"" on the issue of transgender conversion therapy but it was keen for any legislative method brought forward not to have ""unintended consequences"", adding it was a ""legally complex area"". The U-turnled to more than 100 organisations withdrawing fromthe Safe To Be Me Conference, which was due to be held in London over three days this summer. The BBC understands that because of the number of organisations boycotting it, the government is considering cancelling the conference entirely. Boris Johnson has previously called the practice of conversion therapy ""repulsive and abhorrent"" and had promised plans to outlaw it on a number of separate occasions. The government previously said: ""This is a legally complex area and we have a responsibility to ensure unintended consequences are not written into legislation, particularly in the case of under-18s."" A number of gender critical groups had fought for the ban not to include conversion therapy relating to issues of gender identity. Responding to the legislation on Friday, Nikki da Costa, a former director of legislative affairs at No 10, said elements of the law would have had ""profound consequences for children struggling with gender dysphoria"". She told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""Doctors, therapists and parents would be deterred from exploring with a child any feelings of what else may be going on, for fear of being told they're trying to change a child's identity"", adding it was ""deeply concerning"".

'I saw a Russian soldier shoot my father dead',"Yuriy and his father, Ruslan, were trying to get humanitarian aid when a Russian soldier stopped them At around 11:00 on 17 March, Yuriy and his father, Ruslan, were cycling to Bucha's administration building where aid was being handed out. Electricity, gas and water had been cut, and essentials were in short supply in the town, one of the first to be occupied by Russian forces as they advanced on Ukraine's capital Kyiv. Yuriy and his father hoped to pick up some medicine and food. Yuriy said a Russian soldier stopped him and his father on Tarasivska St. They immediately raised their hands. Speaking to the BBC by phone alongside his mother, Alla, the 14-year-old gave his account of what happened next. ""We told them that we weren't carrying any weapons and that we didn't pose any danger,"" he said. ""Then my father turned his head my way, and that's when he got shotâ¦ He was shot twice in the chest, right where the heart is. Then he fell."" At that point, the teenager said, the soldier shot him in his left hand and he fell too. While he was on the ground, he said, he was shot again, this time in the arm. ""I was lying on my stomach, I couldn't see anything that was happening around me,"" Yuriy said. The soldier, he said, shot again, aiming at his head. ""[But] the bullet went through my hood."" Yuriy said the soldier shot again, this time at his father's head. But Ruslan was already dead. ""I had a small panic attack, lying there with my wounded arm underneath me. I saw that my hand was bleeding,"" he said. It was only after a while, when the soldier went behind a tank, that Yuriy got up and ran, he said. Yuriy shows wounds that, he says, were caused by a Russian soldier in Bucha The BBC has not independently verified the details of Yuriy's account, but it comes as evidence grows of atrocities committed by Russian forces while they were in control of Bucha and other towns north of Kyiv. In Bucha alone, bodies of dead men were found lying in the street, many with extensive wounds. Some had been shot through the temple, as if executed. Others had their hands or legs tied behind their backs. Some had clearly been run over by tanks. Many of the bodies were seen along a stretch of Yablonska St, just 2km (one mile) from the street where Ruslan is said to have been killed. Yuriy's mother Alla told the BBC how she had gone to see her husband after the teenager returned home and told her what had happened. She thought Yuriy could be wrong, and that Ruslan was wounded, in need of medical help. ""My son begged me not to,"" Alla said. ""He said they would kill me too."" When she tried to walk down the street, she said, her neighbours stopped her. ""[They] told me not to go further, saying the Russians were killing everyone in the territories under their control."" The next morning, Alla got her mother to help. Wearing white scarves, they went to the site of the shooting. Her mother talked to Russian soldiers and they managed to get through. They finally collected Ruslan's body, and brought it home. A photograph of the partially covered body, taken by Alla and shared with the BBC, appears to confirm Yuriy's testimony. It shows a gunshot wound to the left side of the chest, near the heart. Ruslan, a lawyer, was 49 when he was killed. He was ""active in the community,"" Alla said. ""He couldn't just sit in the shelter and wait. So, he was volunteering and helping people."" They buried him in the garden of the family home. Yuriy said the soldier who killed him was clearly Russian. His uniform was dark green, he said, typical of the Russian army. ""I saw that on his flak jacket it was written 'Russia' in Russian,"" he said. ""We were no danger to the military, we were civilians, wearing white scarves to show that,"" Yuriy said. ""It's very stupid."" Additional reporting by Svitlana Libet LIVE:Latest updates from Ukraine FACT CHECKING:Fact-checking Russian claims about Bucha killings WAR CRIMES:Could Putin be prosecuted?

Minister orders review of fracking impact,"Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has ordered the three month review into fracking The government has ordered a new report on the impact of fracking, days ahead of publishing its energy supply plan. Business Secretary Kwasi Kwarteng has given the British Geological Survey (BGS) three months to assess any changes to the science around the controversial practice. Fracking was halted in the UK in 2019 amid opposition from green groups and local concerns over earth tremors. But senior Conservatives have been calling for a rethink in recent weeks. They claimed fracking would give the country a ""competitive and reliable source of energy"" amid concerns over security of access and rising energy prices. But other MPs and campaigners have warned against a change in direction, with Labour's Ed Miliband saying the new report had ""nothing to do with the energy needs [and] everything to do with the Conservatives bowing to their backbenchers"". Fracking firms claimed the report was a ""tentative first step"" to overturning the ban and ""exploiting [the] potential"" of shale gas. At the time of the moratorium, ministers said they would not change their minds without ""compelling new evidence"". What is fracking? Energy strategy delayed amid Treasury concerns The race is on to solve the UK's energy crisis The move comes ahead of the publication of the government's energy supply strategy, expected this week. Prime Minister Boris Johnson promised the plan in ""days"" on 9 March to help tackle energy prices and reduce reliance on Russia. But the date kept being pushed back, with sources telling the BBC that the Treasury was unhappy with the cost of commitments to nuclear power. The strategy itself is thought to include strategies for nuclear energy and renewable energy, plans to make homes more energy efficient and a route to increasing North Sea oil and gas production. Some Conservatives from the Net Zero Scrutiny Group (NZSG) have also been pushing for a rethink of the government's legally-binding target of net-zero carbon emissions by 2050. But Mr Johnson and his business secretary have both ruled that out. Speaking on Tuesday to the Harvard Kennedy School, Mr Kwarteng said the net-zero target was ""set in stone"", adding: ""The government's view is we don't need to change the targetsâ¦ but we can be more flexible by looking at things like energy efficiency [and a] greater diversity of energy sources."" Earlier in the day, Mr Kwarteng insisted the government ""must be led by the science"" in its approach to fracking. and it would remain banned, unless it was shown to be ""safe, sustainable and of minimal disturbance to those living and working nearby"". ""It remains the case that fracking in England would take years of exploration and development before commercial quantities of gas could be produced for the market, and would certainly have no effect on prices in the near term. ""However, there will continue to be an ongoing demand for oil and gas over the coming decades as we transition to cheap renewable energy and new nuclear power. ""In light of Putin's criminal invasion of Ukraine, it is absolutely right that we explore all possible domestic energy sources."" In his letter to the BGS, Mr Kwarteng asked for more information on any new techniques which could make the fracking process safer and how any risks compare to those associated with other forms of underground energy production. Fracking plans led to rafts of protests in areas like Preston in Lancashire But shadow climate change secretary, Mr Miliband, condemned the move, saying: ""The government itself concluded that fracking is unsafe, and will not help our energy security or cut bills, and fracking is strongly opposed by local communities. ""It is a sign once again that this government cannot be trusted to deliver on the green energy sprint we need for energy security, to cut bills and tackle the climate crisis."" SNP MP Deidre Brock also called for the review ""completely unacceptable"", adding: ""When the leaders of the world descended on Glasgow for COP26, we pledged to do everything we can to end our reliance on fossil fuels, and everything in our power to tackle the climate emergency. ""By reintroducing fracking, we would be going back on our word, which could have devastating consequences."" Friends of the Earth added that it was ""pure fantasy"" that fracking was the answer to the UK's energy needs. Fracking is the process of drilling into the earth, then directing a high pressure mixture of chemicals into layers of rock to release shale gas. The UK has only ever had one fracking site in operation - run by Cuadrilla - which halted in 2019 following a report by the Oil and Gas Authority (OGA). The indefinite suspension came after the OGA found it was not possible to predict the probability or size of tremors caused by the practice. But last week, regulators lifted an order for the two controversial wells to be capped with concrete. The chief executive officer of Cuadrilla, Francis Egan, welcome the government review, claiming they recognised ""the huge potential that shale gas offers this country"". He added: ""We trust that this review will allow Britain's huge shale gas resources to be exploited. ""This can create tens of thousands of jobs, bolster energy security, and provide cheaper gas for local communities, and millions of pounds in tax revenues for northern councils.""

Airport chief stands down after travel chaos,"Travellers at Manchester Airport have faced long queues for check-in and security over the past month Manchester Airport's managing director is to stand down amid criticism of long security queues which have led to passengers missing flights. Manchester Airports Group (MAG) said Karen Smart had decided to leave the business after eight years. Earlier, Greater Manchester Mayor Andy Burnham said police and fire and rescue service staffcould be drafted in to help tackle the chaos. Ian Costigan will take on the role of interim managing director. Travellers at the airport, which is owned by Greater Manchester's 10 councils and an investment firm, have faced long queues for check-in and security over the past month. The problems first came to light in mid-March when passengers were left waiting for hours,with some forced to queue outside in the car park while others missed their flights. MAG previously apologised and said the industry was ""facing staff shortages and recruitment challenges at present, after the most damaging two years in its history"". Charlie Cornish, the group's chief executive officer, said Ms Smart had guided the airport ""through the most challenging period of its 84-year history"". He added that while there would be further challenges ahead, he was ""confident we will soon start to see the benefits of the recovery plans Ms Smart has helped put in place"". A spokesman for MAG, which also runs London Stansted and East Midlands airports, said Ms Smart, who has been managing director for two years, had decided to return to the south of England, where her family lives, to pursue ""fresh career opportunities"". Andy Burnham is meeting airport bosses to discuss the ""concerning"" current situation Mr Costigan, who joined MAG in 2013, has held a number of senior roles in the business, including his most recent post as group transformation director. Airport management are due to meet political leaders and unions to discuss the ongoing situation. Mr Burnham said he would be seeking reassurances about what was being done to bring the situation under control. He said it was ""a difficult moment for airports around the world"", which had been ""laid low for the pandemic"" and were having to ""scale up very quickly"". Police could help tackle 'chaos' at airport Easter flight cancellations to continue for days Passengers swapping flights to avoid airport delays However, he added that passengers ""don't want to see the scenes that we saw at the weekend"", when hundreds had to join long queues to pass through check-in and security. On Friday, Manchester councillor Pat Karney revealed that passenger numbers at the airport hadsurged since the easing of Covid restrictions. ""Two million people went through the airport in February [and] in the previous year, it was 70,000,"" he said. He said the airport's management had put together a ""six-point plan"" to relieve the issues being faced, but added that those ""should have seen all this [and] should have known the recovery was going to be very quick"".

"Hero sacrificed life to save boy, inquest hears","Richard Woodcock died at a flat in Milton Keynes after going to the aid of a two-year-old boy A ""heroic"" neighbour who sacrificed his own life to save a child died after being repeatedly hit with a dumb-bell, a coroner said. The body of Richard Woodcock, 38, was found whenpolice forced their way into a flatat Denmead, in Two Mile Ash, Milton Keynes on 26 June. Coroner Tom Osborne ruled that he was unlawfully killed, but that ""he saved the life of a two-year-old boy"". Kelvin Odichukumma Igweani, 24, died at the flat after police fired four shots. The inquest in Milton Keynes heard how officers from Thames Valley Police were called to reports of an ongoing disturbance at about 09:40 BST. Mr Woodcock had gone to his neighbour's flat after a woman ""fearful for her life"" came to him screaming Mr Woodcock, a council highways officer, had reacted after the ""altercation"" led to a screaming woman arriving at his front door ""fearful of her life and... obviously in an agitated state"". The court heard that Mr Woodcock's wife was on a 999 call to the police when her husband decided to see if he could help the child who was still in the flat, who was thought to be in danger. Mr Woodcock was dragged inside and seriously assaulted ""to the point where he was hit with a 4kg [9lb] dumb-bell"", Mr Osborne said. A post-mortem examination found that he had traumatic head injuries, consistent with repeated blows. It was thought that a large kettle-bell was used as weapon, the court heard. Police were called to the flats on Denmead in Two Mile Ash at about 09:40 BST on Saturday, 26 June Atthe opening of an inquest into Mr Igweani's deathlast July, police said Mr Igweani ""became aggressive"" and a Taser was fired, but it was ineffective. Mr Igweani then barricaded himself in the main bedroom with the child, before armed response officers fired four shots, police said. He died at the scene. At the conclusion of the inquest into Mr Woodcock's death, Mr Osborne added that the little boy, who suffered life-threatening injuries and needed surgery, was saved by Mr Woodcock's ""heroic conduct"". The inquest heard that a woman and another child had got out of the flat before the police arrived. The coroner said the killing had had a ""devastating"" effect on Mr Woodcock's family, who were ""haunted"" by what happened, and that a life had been ""needlessly"" taken. He told the court that Mr Woodcock would be ""remembered for his heroism and his bravery - but I think he will be remembered for more than his death"". Mr Woodcock was struck repeatedly with a dumb-bell and died at the flat in Milton Keynes, the coroner said Mr Osborne said he hoped that at some point the family, who did not want to speak after the inquest, would be able to think of their loved one and recall ""happier times"". In a tribute released by the police last year, Mr Woodcock's family said more people than he ""ever realised"" loved him, with his death a ""huge loss"".

UK to boost research on hypersonic missile defence,"The UK, US, and Australia will begin co-operating on research into hypersonic weapons and how to defend against them, the government has said. The programme will be part of the AUKUS partnership, a security pact announced by the three countries last year. It follows the development of hypersonic missiles by China and Russia and their purported use by Russia in Ukraine last month. Hypersonic weapons are those that exceed five times the speed of sound. They are harder to defend against because of their speed as well as the fact they fly at low altitudes - beyond the line of sight of ground-based radars - and can manoeuvre mid-flight. The UK does not currently possess hypersonic missiles. The US and Australia have an existing joint programme to develop the weapons but the UK government stressed the focus of the new venture would be on defence. Could Chinaâs hypersonic missile spark a new arms race? GCHQ chief warns China over Russia links It said there were no plans for the UK to develop its own hypersonic weapons but the new programme would help it assess whether it would need to develop them in future. It added the latest announcement was not related to Russia's use of the weapons in Ukraine but said the fact other nations were investing in them meant the UK had to think about how to defend against them. On 19 March,Russia claimed to have used a hypersonic missileto destroy an arms depot in western Ukraine, and US military intelligence has suggested Russian forces have used them repeatedly since. The attacks would mark the first use of hypersonic missiles in combat. It came just months afterChina caught US intelligence by surprisewhen it tested two nuclear-capable hypersonic missiles. Each circled the globe in low-orbit space before coming back down to Earth, the second missing its target by only about 24 miles (40 km). The missile is thought to combine a so-called fractional orbital bombardment system, which sends missiles into a partial orbit of the Earth to strike from an unexpected direction, with a hypersonic glider, which remains in the outer atmosphere and is hard to detect until later into its flight. The tests demonstrated China had far more advanced space capability than had previously been understood. North Korea has also claimed to be in the process of testing hypersonic missiles. Hypersonic missiles are potentially a game-changer in the way future wars will be fought. As their name suggests, they travel at immense speed - Mach 5 or greater, which equates to around a mile a second. They are what is called ""dual capable"" meaning they can carry either a conventional explosive or nuclear warhead. They can also be launched from either air, sea or land. There are two types of these weapon: cruise missiles and glide vehicles. The cruise variant, of which Russia has several, can be launched from an aircraft and hit a target more than 1,200 miles away. The glide variant is launched up into space from where it then glides down to earth on an unpredictable path. Hypersonic missiles are changing the way nations plan for their strategic defence for two reasons. Firstly, they are so fast there would be very little time - just minutes - between a launch being detected and a country's leader having to decide whether to retaliate. There is almost no way of knowing whether that missile is nuclear-tipped or not. Secondly, their flight path, especially that of a hypersonic glide vehicle (HGV), is so hard to predict it makes interception extremely difficult. Currently China is in the forefront of hypersonic missile development, closely followed by Russia, which has already used them to hit long distance targets in Ukraine. The US is late to the game and some of its tests have not gone well. Britain does not possess any and is only now forming an alliance with the US and Australia to carry out research into them and how, if possible, to defend against them. The AUKUS partnership, announced in September 2021, is a trilateral security pact for the Indo-Pacific region. The primary purpose of the deal is for the US and UK to help Australia acquire nuclear-powered submarines. The deal also aims to deepen co-operation on cyber capabilities, artificial intelligence, quantum technologies, and additional undersea capabilities. Following Tuesday's announcement, the UK's national security advisor Stephen Lovegrove said: ""When we bring together the technical knowledge and capabilities of our three countries, we can achieve a huge amount to help keep ourselves and our allies and partners safe. ""In light of Russia's invasion of Ukraine, it's more important now than ever that allies work together to defend democracy, international law and freedom around the world.""

The Works forced to shut some shops after cyber-attack,"The Works has been forced to shut shops temporarily and suspend new stock deliveries after a cyber-attack. The retailer said five of its 526 shops have been closed since last week after hackers gained access to its computer systems and caused issues with its tills. Customers are experiencing longer delivery times for online orders as a result. The company said that no shoppers' payment details had been compromised. In a statement, The Works said: ""Customers can continue to shop safely at The Works, both in store and online."" It pointed out that all debit and credit card payments are processed outside of its own systems, although it is still working out whether or not customers' personal data may have been affected. KP Snacks hack prompts crisp supplies warning Cyber-attack strikes German fuel supplies The toys and crafts shop said that it made ""immediate changes to further strengthen its security position"", as well as taking on cyber security experts who are investigating the attack. It was made aware of the hack last week, which has been described as a ""ransomware"" attack, although the hackers are understood not to have made any demands for cash. The firm disabled all access to its systems, including email, as a precautionary measure once it found out. It is working to reopen the five shops as soon as it can, while store deliveries are expected to resume ""imminently"", according to its statement. It also said that normal online deliveries would be reintroduced gradually, and that it did not expect  the attack to have a severe impact on its forecasts for sales or its financial position this year. The Works said it had told the Information Commissioner's Office (ICO) about the attack. The ICO can enforce fines in cases of serious data breaches. In February, shops were warned that deliveries of nuts and crisps could be affected after KP Snacks was hit by a ransomware attack. The producer of McCoys and Hula Hoops apologised after it said the problems could last into March. Cyber security expert Simon Edwards suggested that this recent attack on The Works should serve as an example to other companies. ""Since hostilities started in Ukraine there has been a massive increase in cyber attacks targeting all industry sectors. Although we are yet to know more from the company itself, typically these attacks start with a malicious email sent to an employee,"" he pointed out. He added that hackers may have used ""wiper"" malware in this instance, which effectively destroys the systems it targets. He also recommended that staff should carry out training to highlight the risk of clicking on links in emails.

Over 60% of Putin's war chest frozen - Truss,"More than 60% of Putin's war chest has been frozen by sanctions but more needs to be done, Liz Truss has said. The foreign secretary said ""crippling"" sanctions are pushing the Russian economy back ""into the Soviet era"". More than $350bn (Â£266bn) of Russia's $604bn foreign currency reserves are unavailable to the regime, she added. Her call for more to be done comes amidcondemnation after images of bodies in the streets of Bucha, near Kyiv, emerged after Russian troops withdrew. Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelensky has warned he believesthe worst atrocities committed by Russian forces are yet to be discovered, but Russia has denied killing civilians - claiming, without evidence, that Ukraine has staged such scenes. Prime Minister Boris Johnson has released avideo on social media,external, addressed to the Russian public, in which he accuses Russian troops of committing atrocities, including the massacre of civilians and the raping of women. Speaking in Russian at the close of the video, he says: ""Your president stands accused of committing war crimes. But I cannot believe he's acting in your name."" Ms Truss, who spoke after talks with her Polish counterpart Zbigniew Rau, urged G7 countries to go further in their sanctions ahead of G7 and Nato meetings this week. Measures she is calling for include banning Russian ships from their ports, cracking down on Russian banks, going after industries ""filling Putin's war chest"" such as the gold trade, and agreeing a timetable to eliminate imports of Russian oil and gas. Ms Truss said the only way to end the war is for Russian President Mr Putin to lose in Ukraine and will stress the urgency of stepping up sanctions, as well as giving weapons to Ukraine to defend itself. ""Although Russian troops have been defeated in their initial assault on Kyiv, there has been no change in their intent and ambition,"" she said. ""We are seeing Putin's forces set their sights on the east and south of Ukraine, with the same reckless disregard for civilian lives and their nationhood. ""So far our sanctions have had a crippling impact on those who feed and fund Putin's war machine.""

WATCH:Ambulance crew on the front line READ MORE:Full coverage of the crisis,external Both the EU and the US are planning more sanctions on Russia this week, with EU ambassadorsmeeting on Wednesday to decide what steps to take. European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen has outlined a fifth wave of sanctions, including an import ban on Russian coal, which she said was worth 4bn euro (Â£3.34bn) per year. Earlier, Ms Truss agreed with her equivalent from Japan, a fellow G7 member, that the international community must increase pressure on Russia with further co-ordinated sanctions. The UK has also announced a Â£10m fund to support organisations in Ukraine, including those helping victims of conflict-related sexual violence. The UK will also be providing funding and technical assistance for the International Criminal Court's investigation into reports of rape. ""We have all been shocked by the scenes from Bucha,"" she said. ""These are appalling acts of the kind that we thought we left in the 20th Century."" A satellite image of the town from 19 March appears to show bodies lying in the street nearly two weeks before Russians left Bucha. The picture directlycontradicts Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov's claimthat footage of bodies in Bucha was ""staged"" after the Russians withdrew. It shows objects that appear to be bodies in the precise locations where Ukrainian forces subsequently found them when they regained control of the town. During the foreign secretary's visit she also praised Poland for being on the ""front line of helping Ukraine"" and for always being ""clear-eyed"" about ""Putin's malign intent"". Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has called for countries to stop buying oil, gas and coal from Russia to avert ""new Buchas"". He described the move as the ""mother of all sanctions"", saying it would stop the war in a matter of months. THE GREATEST BOXER IN HISTORY:The incredible life of Muhammad Ali...

Shanghai Covid lockdown extended to entire city,"Chinese authorities have extended their lockdown of Shanghai to cover all its 25 million people after a fresh surge in Covid cases. Initially, there had been separate measures for the eastern and western sides, but the whole city is now subject to indefinite restrictions. Shanghai is the largest single city to be locked down to date. The important financial hub has battled a new wave of coronavirus infections for more than a month. Reported cases have risen to more than 13,000 a day, although the numbers are not high by some international standards. Residents in some areas of the city said the strict policy meant no-one was allowed to leave their housing compounds, not even to collect essential provisions. They reported difficulties in ordering food and water online, with restrictions on when customers are able to place their orders, because of a shortage of supplies and delivery staff. This country's ""zero-Covid"" system is, at best, struggling to cope. China has done Covid lockdowns before, but not on the scale of its financial mega-city. The logistical challenges required to confine 25 million people to their homes, while keeping them fed, are huge. Social media here is full of angry residents complaining that they can't order food because the delivery system is clogged up. Centralised isolation facilities - many using only camp beds, with no showers or other facilities - are bursting with infected people squashed in next to one another. One of China's few reliable media outlets, Caixin, has reported that close contacts of infected people will be moved to neighbouring provinces. This could potentially involve hundreds of thousands of Shanghai residents. The Chinese government's complete elimination strategy has become something of a mantra, with the government ridiculing other countries for sacrificing their own people on the altar of opening up. Some medical specialists here have tried to get the message through that, for a vaccinated person, catching the Omicron variant of Covid will probably not necessitate going to hospital - that you can simply ride it out at home until you recover. Few people in China seem to be aware of this. Their officials and state media have kept it from them. So the lockdowns continue and it's not only Shanghai closed right now. Jilin City (3.6 million people), Changchun (nine million), Xuzhou (nine million), the steel city of Tangshan (7.7 million) and various other towns and villages are keeping their residents indoors. The strain on people, and the economic cost of it all, must be enormous. The city is testing the limits ofChina's zero-Covid strategy, amid growing public anger over quarantine rules. The policy sets China apart from most other countries which are trying to live with the virus. But the increased transmissibility and milder nature of the Omicron variant has led to questions over whether the current strategy is sustainable in the long run. How is China's zero-Covid strategy changing? Omicron vs Zero-Covid: How long can China hold on? ""Currently, Shanghai's epidemic prevention and control is at the most difficult and most critical stage,"" said Wu Qianyu, an official with the municipal health commission. ""We must adhere to the general policy of dynamic clearance without hesitation, without wavering."" On Monday, Shanghai reported a record 13,086 new asymptomatic coronavirus cases, after a city-wide testing programme took samples from more than 25 million people in 24 hours. At least 38,000 people have been deployed to Shanghai from other regions, in what state media have said is the biggest nationwide medical operation since the shutdown of Wuhan in early 2020.

What are Elon Musk's plans for Twitter?,"Musk is now the single biggest shareholder in Twitter - so what's his next move? Elon Musk didn't actually tweet about his new stake in Twitter, which for an avid tweeter seemed somewhat ironic. Maybe it was because the 9.2% he now owns is described as a passive stake, although those who know Musk do not expect it to stay that way for long. His first move was tolaunch a poll,external- asking whether people want an edit button, something long called for and perhaps something he personally needs. The new announcement that he will join Twitter's board comes as no surprise. In a tweet on Tuesday, Twitter chief executive Parag Agrawal said ""through conversations with Elon in recent weeks, it became clear to us that he would bring great value to our Board"".

Musk's 9.2%  stake in the social media company may sound small, but Dan Ives, from analyst firm Wedbush, describes it as ""eye-popping"" - equating to 73.5 million shares in the social network. Shares in the platform soared following Monday's revelation that the Tesla founder had become the largest shareholder in the company - meaning that stake has already grown in value and is now worth more than $3bn. Musk's shareholding is four times greater than that of Twitter founder Jack Dorsey, who stepped down as chief executive in November. Mr Ives believes the South African entrepreneur now has his eyes ""laser set"" on Twitter, and his significant holding will see him push for an active role in the management of the company. ""We would expect this passive stake as just the start of broader conversations with the Twitter board/management that could ultimately lead to an active stake and a potential more aggressive ownership role of Twitter,"" he said. When Elon Musk has an idea, he often turns to Twitter to express it Musk has something of a love-hate relationship with Twitter. He is a frequent tweeter, with more than 80 million followers - and no stranger to controversy in his interactions on the social media site. The platform seems to suit his impulsive personality - last year he famously asked if he should sell 10% of his stock in his electric car firm Tesla, to which Twitter users said 'yes'. It led to Muskselling around $5bn (Â£3.7bn) of shares in the firm in November. Months earlier he had offered to sign a cheque for $6bn if the World Food Programme (WFP) could explain how it would be used to solve hunger around the globe - after an assertion made by the head of the UN programme. But tweeting has also got him into trouble. A 2018 post about Tesla stock led to an investigation from the Securities and Exchange Commission which ended with an agreement requiring the firm's lawyers to pre-approve certain tweets. It is unclear if that actually happens. Interestingly, the Wall Street Journal reports that his Twitter share filings with the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC), which under normal circumstances would include a line saying he doesn't intend to influence the company, came with a 'Not Applicable' mark. The timing of the deal has also raised questions and could once again put Musk at loggerheads with financial regulators. His investment in Twitter was filed on 14 March, but not announced until this week. US securities law requires disclosure within 10 days of acquiring 5% of a company. Musk uses Twitter not just as a barometer for how he runs his own companies, but also increasingly to take the temperature of the nation. Last month, after he had lodged his investment with the SEC - but before his shareholding became public knowledge - he asked users whether they believed that free speech was essential to a functioning democracy and whether Twitter adheres to this principle. Cornell University's assistant professor Alexandra Cirone thinks this is evidence he may use his new stake ""to try to influence Twitter practices"" and for a ""more active play in the social media eco-system"". But others see more immediate issues with his musings. Howard Fischer, partner at law firm Moses & Singer, told Reuters that, given he had already bought a stake in Twitter, these questions could be seen as a form of market manipulation. ""I do suspect the SEC is going to look long and hard into whether they can bring manipulation charges, along with the failure to file,"" he said. Mr Agrawal is clearly watching his every move. In response to his edit button poll, which currently has 2.6 million responses, he urged voters to do so ""carefully"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

""The consequences of this poll will be important,"" he said, echoing the exact same words Musk used after he launched his free speech Twitter poll. Jack Dorsey had always rejected the idea, and critics point out that it could allow people to fundamentally change the meaning of tweets after they have been shared. It would be a big change for Twitter to include an edit button, and Musk is clearly keen to be part of that conversation. Many wishing to join Trump's new Twitter have found they are on a waiting list For a while last month, it looked as if Musk was intent on building a new social media platform as a rival to Twitter - and there he does have precedent from another prolific and controversial tweeter. Donald Trump, who was banned from Twitter in January 2021 after the Capitol riots, announced last autumn that he was launching his own social network - dubbed Truth Social - to ""stand up to the tyranny of big tech"". But six weeks after its launch, there is a waiting list of 1.5 million who are unable to use it - with the platform branded a disaster by Joshua Tucker, director of NYU's Center for social media and politics. According to Reuters, two key executives quit after the troubled launch. For those with shares in Musk's many other businesses - Space X, Tesla, Neuralink, The Boring Company - there will doubtless be a sigh of relief that he didn't go down the same route as Mr Trump. But there will also be concerns that he has yet another passion project to distract him from the serious business of running his established firms. Not to mention the issues that might now be raised about the Twitter deal by the SEC. Social media expert Casey Newton points out that it is not the first time a big tech firm has eyed Twitter. Microsoft chief executive Steve Ballmer once bought a four percent share of the company ""and essentially did nothing with it,""he writes.,external But he goes on to say that Ballmer never tweeted like Musk did: ""gleefully, annoyingly, constantly"". And it seems most likely that it will be from this Twitter account that Musk will let the world know what he intends to do next.

During the foreign secretary's visit she also praised Poland for being on the ""front line of helping Ukraine"" and for always being ""clear-eyed"" about ""Putin's malign intent"". Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has called for countries to stop buying oil, gas and coal from Russia to avert ""new Buchas"". He described the move as the ""mother of all sanctions"", saying it would stop the war in a matter of months. THE GREATEST BOXER IN HISTORY:The incredible life of Muhammad Ali...

Celebrities and footballers to get gambling ad ban,"Footballers, celebrities and social media influencers will be banned from gambling adverts under new rules. From October, gambling companies will not be allowed to use stars to target under-18s, The Committee for Advertising Practice said. Anyone with a ""strong appeal"" for young people, such as footballer Cristiano Ronaldo and Love Island star Chris Hughes, must not appear in the adverts. The body representing betting firms said it welcomed the new rules. Michael Dugher, chief executive of the Betting and Gaming Council (BGC) said the changes built on industry-led measures designed to ""drive up standards and ensure further protections in advertising."" The Committee for Advertising Practice (CAP) said the ""tough"" new rules were part of its commitment to safeguarding young people and vulnerable audiences. The new rules state that gambling and lottery ads must not ""be likely to be of strong appeal to children or young persons, especially by reflecting or being associated with youth culture."" References to video game content and gameplay popular with under-18s are also against the new rules. There is opposition to gambling advertising amongst some politicians, parents and groups that campaign for awareness around gambling addiction. Former England and Arsenal footballer Paul Merson, who became addicted to gambling himself, last month told BBC Sport it""sickens"" him to see former players and managers in gambling adverts. Earlier this year, Paddy Power launched a tongue-in-cheek ad featuring former Arsenal and West Ham player Jack Wilshere. Former Tottenham Hotspur manager and I'm a Celebrity winner Harry Redknapp has previously appeared in ads for Betvictor. And former Love Island contestant Chris Hughes is a brand ambassador for Coral Racing. Ex-players in gambling ads 'sicken me' Gambling laws need urgent change - Lib Dem peer 'Winning Â£127,000 was the worst day of my life' Shahriar Coupal, director of CAP, said: ""By ending these practices, our new rules invite a new era for gambling ads, more particular to the adult audience they can target and more befitting of the age-restricted product they're promoting."" Lord Don Foster, chairman of Peers for Gambling Reform welcomed the CAP's step but warned it would not block all advertising reaching young audiences. ""It won't stop gambling advertisements appearing on the shirts of children's sporting heroes nor many of the other concerning actions of gambling companies who spend over Â£1.5bn a year promoting their products,"" he said. ""The government should ban all links between sport and gambling, all inducements, such as so-called ""free"" bets, and direct marketing to individual customers and take steps to reduce all forms of gambling advertising,"" said Lord Foster. The industry body, the BGC said previously introduced measures were already helping to tackle the problem. A ""whistle-to-whistle"" ban on TV commercials during live sport before the 9pm watershed introduced in 2019 had reduced the ads seen by young people at that time by 97%, Mr Dugher said. ""Our members also introduced new age gating rules on advertising on social platforms, restricting the ads to those aged 25 and over for most sites,"" he added. Playing cards, scratchcards, fruit machines and betting between friends were more popular platforms among young people for gambling than BGC member firms, Mr Dugher said ""The BGC take a zero tolerance approach to gambling by those under the age of 18 and we enforce the toughest possible action,"" he said. The Conservative's 2019 election manifesto promised to overhaul gambling laws, following growing concerns over gambling's impact, especially on the young.

"'Hero' sacrificed life to save boy, inquest hears","Richard Woodcock died at a flat in Milton Keynes after going to the aid of a two-year-old boy A ""heroic"" neighbour who sacrificed his own life to save a child died after being repeatedly hit with a dumb-bell, a coroner said. The body of Richard Woodcock, 38, was found whenpolice forced their way into a flatat Denmead, in Two Mile Ash, Milton Keynes on 26 June. Coroner Tom Osborne ruled that he was unlawfully killed, but that ""he saved the life of a two-year-old boy"". Kelvin Odichukumma Igweani, 24, died at the flat after police fired four shots. The inquest in Milton Keynes heard how officers from Thames Valley Police were called to reports of an ongoing disturbance at about 09:40 BST. Mr Woodcock had gone to his neighbour's flat after a woman ""fearful for her life"" came to him screaming Mr Woodcock, a council highways officer, had reacted after the ""altercation"" led to a screaming woman arriving at his front door ""fearful of her life and... obviously in an agitated state"". The court heard that Mr Woodcock's wife was on a 999 call to the police when her husband decided to see if he could help the child who was still in the flat, who was thought to be in danger. Mr Woodcock was dragged inside and seriously assaulted ""to the point where he was hit with a 4kg [9lb] dumb-bell"", Mr Osborne said. A post-mortem examination found that he had traumatic head injuries, consistent with repeated blows. It was thought that a large kettle-bell was used as weapon, the court heard. Police were called to the flats on Denmead in Two Mile Ash at about 09:40 BST on Saturday, 26 June Atthe opening of an inquest into Mr Igweani's deathlast July, police said Mr Igweani ""became aggressive"" and a Taser was fired, but it was ineffective. Mr Igweani then barricaded himself in the main bedroom with the child, before armed response officers fired four shots, police said. He died at the scene. At the conclusion of the inquest into Mr Woodcock's death, Mr Osborne added that the little boy, who suffered life-threatening injuries and needed surgery, was saved by Mr Woodcock's ""heroic conduct"". The inquest heard that a woman and another child had got out of the flat before the police arrived. The coroner said the killing had had a ""devastating"" effect on Mr Woodcock's family, who were ""haunted"" by what happened, and that a life had been ""needlessly"" taken. He told the court that Mr Woodcock would be ""remembered for his heroism and his bravery - but I think he will be remembered for more than his death"". Mr Woodcock was struck repeatedly with a dumb-bell and died at the flat in Milton Keynes, the coroner said Mr Osborne said he hoped that at some point the family, who did not want to speak after the inquest, would be able to think of their loved one and recall ""happier times"". In a tribute released by the police last year, Mr Woodcock's family said more people than he ""ever realised"" loved him, with his death a ""huge loss"". In her own tribute, his wife said it had been a ""blessing to share my life with you, my dearest friend, my biggest love, my soulmate"".

Can Europe end its reliance on Russian energy?,"EU officials say sanctions on Russian imports of coal and oil are definitely being considered The EU is proposing further sanctions against the Kremlin after allegations of Russian war crimes in Ukraine, with EU ambassadors meeting on Wednesday to decide what steps to take. European Commission head Ursula von der Leyen said planned measures included an import ban on coal and a ban on Russian ships and road operators. The US is also planning more sanctions. And UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss is calling for a ""tough new wave"" of sanctions from G7 and Nato ministers. She said her Japanese counterpart had agreed the international community had to increase pressure on Russia's Vladimir Putin ""and his war machine with further co-ordinated sanctions"". EU officials had earlier indicated the focus would be on enforcing existing measures. But revelations of atrocities, with hundreds of bodies of civilians found in towns abandoned by Russian troops, have given added impetus for new measures. ""The new sanctions will probably be adopted tomorrow,"" French European Affairs Minister ClÃ©ment Beaune said on Tuesday. Ms von der Leyen said the proposals included: A ban on coal imports worth â¬4bn a year, and a full ban on four Russian banks including Russia's second biggest bank VTB A ban on Russian ships entering EU ports (with some exemptions) and on Russian and Belarusian road transport operators Bans on EU exports in advanced semiconductors and machinery worth â¬10bn and other EU imports on wood and cement, seafood and alcohol. Russian companies would also be barred from taking part in competing for contracts across the EU. The EU was also working on other sanctions including on imports of Russian oil, she said. What sanctions are being imposed on Russia? This is the fifth set of EU sanctions so far. Earlier measures have ranged from individuals including Vladimir Putin and hundreds of Russian MPs, to the financial and energy sectors. The 27 member states plan to cut use of Russian gas by two-thirds by the end of this year and then make Europe entirely independent of Russian fossil fuels by 2030. There is an active debate in Germany on imposing a total embargo on Russian energy, but the government warns it would trigger a recession and mass unemployment and for the moment it has ruled it out. ""If it would stop the war, then we would do it immediately,"" said Foreign Minister Annalena Baerbock. At the start of the war Germany was quick to halt the big Nord Stream 2 gas pipeline from Russia before it went online Germany relied on Russian gas for 55% of its imports last year, while for the EU as a whole it was 40%. Experts widely agree that sanctions agreed by the West until now are unprecedented but Eddie Fishman rates them at ""seven or an eight of 10 in intensity"". He was a lead official in the US State Department in 2014 when sanctions were drawn up in response to Russia's illegal annexation of Crimea in 2014. ""Oil remains the life-blood of Russia's economy,"" he argues. ""Putin has made billions of dollars since the war began and Russia's oil sales remain very strong."" The EU's latest proposals tighten sanctions on four Russian banks. Although major Russian banks have been shut out of the Swift financial messaging system, two of the biggest are not. Again, it's energy-related. Sberbank and Gazprombank facilitate energy payments from Europe to Russia. Lithuania announced that from the start of this month it had put a stop to all Russian gas imports. ""Look friends, you can do the same,"" President Gitanis Nauseda told his EU counterparts. It had become possible through investment in liquified natural gas and electricity link infrastructure, he explained. But could the EU, as a whole, really turn off the taps to Russian energy? There have been warnings of factory closures, jobs losses and plummeting public consent for sanctions. You would have to pray for warm and windy weather, says Jacob Kirkegaard of the German Marshall Fund. Warm to lessen the need for heating homes - and windy to power Europe's electricity generating turbines. And while Mr Kirkegaard agrees with German Chancellor Olaf Scholz that a ban could trigger a recession, he believes the blow to Russia would be worse. ""The Russian government would, in my opinion, be compelled to start printing large amounts of new roubles with the risk of inciting significant additional inflation in Russia."" Beyond energy, sanctions so far have hit Russia's tech, aviation and finance sectors, as well as its oligarchs - the wealthy Russians who made their fortunes under President Putin's patronage. But, as Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky reminded Belgian lawmakers in an address last week, there are other awkward areas where business goes on. Rough diamonds are still moving from Russia to Antwerp and sea ports remain open to Russian shipping. So while trade ties between the EU and Russia have been seriously frayed, strained but lucrative connections remain. LIVE:Latest updates from Ukraine FACT CHECKING:Fact-checking Russian claims about Bucha killings WAR CRIMES:Could Putin be prosecuted? WATCH:Ambulance crew on the front line READ MORE:Full coverage of the crisis,external An energy embargo remains the ""ultimate"" economic severance weapon, and Germany is usually cited as the main obstacle to that. But other countries are accused of hiding behind Chancellor Olaf Scholz's frank assessments. ""Germany is really afraid of what might happen to its economy,"" says Prof Karen Pittel, a director at the Ifo Institute for Economic Research in Munich. ""But in principle, if it happens tomorrow, then we'll survive it."" She also believes that the outlook has shifted after President Putin began demanding payment for gas in roubles. Germany refused but Prof Pittel says it's possible there may come a time when Germany has no other choice than to abandon Russian energy. It still seems extremely unlikely that Europe will be cut off from Russian supplies in one, big dramatic move, but pressure is mounting. ""Clear and determined sanctions are necessary. These sanctions are not working,"" Polish Prime Minister Mateusz Morawiecki said this week. Until recently, the idea of an energy embargo would not have just seemed unlikely. It would have been unthinkable.

Sri Lanka MPs leave Rajapaksa-led coalitionMore than 40 aligned with Mr Rajapaksa's coalition say they will independently represent themselves.Asia,"Gotabaya Rajapaksa (pictured) has so far refused to step down despite his cabinet's resignation More than 40 MPs have left Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's coalition government. MPs from parties aligned with Mr Rajapaksa's Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) led coalition said they would now independently represent themselves. The move comes as the South Asian nation is grappling with power cuts and shortages because of an economic and foreign exchange crisis. This has led to mass protests demanding Mr Rajapaksa's resignation. It is unclear what the implications of the MPs' actions are at this point. They have distanced themselves from the government, but have not extended support to the opposition. It could, however, call into question the prime minister's authority over the parliament. Mr Rajapaksa's cabinet has already resigned, but both the president and his brother, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, have so far refused to step down. Instead, the president called on opposition parties to help him form a national government and accept cabinet portfolios. They have all refused and have reiterated demands for him to resign. ""What the people want is for this president and the entire government to step down,"" said Sajith Premadasa, leader of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya, Sri Lanka's main opposition alliance. Angry Sri Lankans want president to go On Tuesday, a freshly appointed finance minister also announced he was quitting the job, less than 24 hours after accepting the post. Ali Sabry, a close ally of President Rajapaksa, said he would give up his parliament seat for someone outside politics who might be ""suitable to handle the situation"". Meanwhile, anti-government protests continued on Tuesday in major cities across the country. ""People can't afford their daily rice, their dhal, their basic necessities. People can't get on buses to come to work, to go to school,"" one protester told the BBC. ""How much worse can it get? There's no petrol, there's no diesel, kids can't sit their exams because there's no paper,"" said another. Protesters have taken to the streets in Sri Lanka's cities calling for President Rajapaksa to resign over his government's financial handling In the past days, demonstrations calling for the resignation of the president have picked up momentum. Protesters even defied a curfew meant to last from Friday to Sunday in order to halt a planned day of protests,after a demonstration outside the president's house on Thursday night turned violent. The demonstrations mark a massive turnaround in popularity for Mr Rajapaksa, who swept into power with a majority win in 2019, promising stability and a ""strong hand"" to rule the country. Sri Lanka is now struggling to pay for imports of fuel and other goods because of a shortage of foreign exchange, which has exacerbated its worst economic crisis since independence from the UK in 1948. The country needs foreign currency to pay for imports of fuel. ""There are endless shortages of essentials, including fuel and cooking gas. Hospitals are on the verge of closing because there are no medicines,"" Maithripala Sirisena, Sri Lanka's former president and leader of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party that withdrew its support for Mr Rajapaksa's coalition, told parliament.

Ministers to go ahead with Channel 4 privatisation,"Channel 4, founded in 1982, is funded by advertising but is publicly owned The government has decided to go ahead with plans to privatise Channel 4. A source said ministers believed public ownership was holding the broadcaster back ""in the face of a rapidly changing media landscape"". Plans for the sale, on which there has been a public consultation, will be included in May's Queen's Speech. But Channel 4 called it ""disappointing"" that ministers had made their decision despite ""significant public interest concerns"" over privatisation. Money made from the sale will be reinvested in a ""creative dividend"" to be shared among the TV industry, with some of it earmarked for independent production companies. Channel 4, founded by Margaret Thatcher's Conservative government in 1982 to deliver programmes for under-served audiences, is funded by advertising but is publicly owned. Channel 4 consultation over privatisation begins Channel 4 warns of privatisation risks Channel 4 move makes Leeds the new media city Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries said: ""Channel 4 rightly holds a cherished place in British life and I want that to remain the case. I have come to the conclusion that government ownership is holding Channel 4 back from competing against streaming giants like Netflix and Amazon. ""A change of ownership will give Channel 4 the tools and freedom to flourish and thrive as a public service broadcaster long into the future."" A government source said the channel would lose its ""straitjacket"" but retain its commitment to primetime news programming. The Channel 4 show It's a Sin has been nominated for 11 Bafta awards When it was announced last year that the government was carrying out a consultation on privatising Channel 4, its bosses warned of ""a real risk"" to some of its programmes. Responding to the announcement that the move was going ahead, a spokesperson for the broadcaster said: ""With over 60,000 submissions to the government's public consultation, it is disappointing that today's announcement has been made without formally recognising the significant public interest concerns which have been raised."" They added that there needed to be a ""lengthy legislative process and political debate"", saying: ""Channel 4 remains legally committed to its unique public-service remit. ""The focus for the organisation will be on how we can ensure we deliver the remit to both our viewers and the British creative economy across the whole of the UK."" In 2019, Channel 4, which brought shows including Friends, Big Brother and Countdown to UK audiences, opened a base in Leeds, to operate alongside its London headquarters. For Labour, shadow culture secretary Lucy Powell said: ""Selling off Channel 4, which doesn't cost the taxpayer a penny anyway, to what is likely to be a foreign company, makes absolutely no sense. It will cost jobs and opportunities in the North and Yorkshire, and hit the wider British creative economy."" Liberal Democrat culture spokesman Jamie Stone said: ""Occasionally, we as a country manage to magic up a world-renowned gem into being and Channel 4 is a perfect example. And yet this government seems hell-bent on trashing this uniquely British legacy and undermining jobs and investment in the creative sector."" And SNP culture spokesman John Nicolson called the government's decision a ""direct attack on an innovative broadcaster which produces independent, high-quality journalism"".

Britney Spears says she will publish new memoir,"Britney Spears has confirmed that she is in the process of writing a book, confirming recent reports in US media that the star intended to pen a new tell-all memoir. Spears shared the news in a message posted on Instagram on Monday night. The singer said the memoir will tackle painful events in her life that she has ""never been able to express openly"". In November, a judge ended a legal guardianship that controlled many aspects of her life for over a decade. Spears was put into a conservatorship managed by her father, Jamie Spears, in 2008, when the star faced a mental health crisis. Thecontroversial arrangement allowed him to take power over her financesand career decisions plus major personal matters, such as her visits to her teenage sons and whether she could remarry. While the star didn't reveal any details about a potential release date or publisher,Page Six reported in February that she had reached a $15m,external($11.4m) deal with the publishing house Simon & Schuster to chronicle her life, career and relationship with her family during and after her conservatorship. Spears wrote that the process of writing the book has been ""healing and therapeutic,"" though she added that it had been difficult bringing up past events in her life. The 40-year old added that she has taken an ""intellectual approach"" to writing the memoir. However, the star also hit out at her mother and sister, who she accused of taking an ""indulgence by writing their own books as I couldn't even get a cup of coffee or drive my car"". Spears has been engaged in a public dispute with her sister, Jamie Lynn, since the latershe appeared on Good Morning America to promote her book,Things I Should Have Said. The book details her own life story, including her young daughter's near-fatal accident in 2017, her relationship with Britney and the role she played in the singer's controversial conservatorship.

Sri Lanka parties leave Rajapaksa-led coalition,"Gotabaya Rajapaksa (pictured) has so far refused to step down despite his cabinet's resignation More than 40 MPs have left Sri Lankan President Gotabaya Rajapaksa's coalition government. MPs from parties aligned with Mr Rajapaksa's Sri Lanka Podujana Peramuna (SLPP) led coalition said they would now independently represent themselves. The move comes as the South Asian nation is grappling with power cuts and shortages because of an economic and foreign exchange crisis. This has led to mass protests demanding Mr Rajapaksa's resignation. It is unclear what the implications of the MPs' actions are at this point. They have distanced themselves from the government, but have not extended support to the opposition. It could, however, call into question the prime minister's authority over the parliament. Mr Rajapaksa's cabinet has already resigned, but both the president and his brother, Prime Minister Mahinda Rajapaksa, have so far refused to step down. Instead, the president called on opposition parties to help him form a national government and accept cabinet portfolios. They have all refused and have reiterated demands for him to resign. ""What the people want is for this president and the entire government to step down,"" said Sajith Premadasa, leader of the Samagi Jana Balawegaya, Sri Lanka's main opposition alliance. Angry Sri Lankans want president to go On Tuesday, a freshly appointed finance minister also announced he was quitting the job, less than 24 hours after accepting the post. Ali Sabry, a close ally of President Rajapaksa, said he would give up his parliament seat for someone outside politics who might be ""suitable to handle the situation"". Meanwhile, anti-government protests continued on Tuesday in major cities across the country. ""People can't afford their daily rice, their dhal, their basic necessities. People can't get on buses to come to work, to go to school,"" one protester told the BBC. ""How much worse can it get? There's no petrol, there's no diesel, kids can't sit their exams because there's no paper,"" said another. Protesters have taken to the streets in Sri Lanka's cities calling for President Rajapaksa to resign over his government's financial handling In the past days, demonstrations calling for the resignation of the president have picked up momentum. Protesters even defied a curfew meant to last from Friday to Sunday in order to halt a planned day of protests,after a demonstration outside the president's house on Thursday night turned violent. The demonstrations mark a massive turnaround in popularity for Mr Rajapaksa, who swept into power with a majority win in 2019, promising stability and a ""strong hand"" to rule the country. Sri Lanka is now struggling to pay for imports of fuel and other goods because of a shortage of foreign exchange, which has exacerbated its worst economic crisis since independence from the UK in 1948. The country needs foreign currency to pay for imports of fuel. ""There are endless shortages of essentials, including fuel and cooking gas. Hospitals are on the verge of closing because there are no medicines,"" Maithripala Sirisena, Sri Lanka's former president and leader of the Sri Lanka Freedom Party that withdrew its support for Mr Rajapaksa's coalition, told parliament.

Biden calls for Putin war crimes trial over civilian killings,"Shocking images of bodies of civilians in the streets of Bucha, near Kyiv, have led to an outpouring of international condemnation of Russia US President Biden calls Vladimir Putin a war criminal â and says he should face trial over the incidents Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky - on a visit to Bucha - accuses Russian forces of committing genocide The BBC has seen further evidence of civilian killings near Kyiv - a shallow grave where four people allegedly shot dead by Russian forces were buried Downing Street says the attacks on civilians are ""barbaric"" and that the UK will push forward on more sanctions and military aid Russia says it rejects ""all allegations"" and is claiming videos have been faked, without providing any evidence Edited by Jude Sheerin Yogita LimayeBBC News Olha Sukhenko, her husband Igor and her son Oleksander are all said to have been killed In the town of Bucha, just outside Kyiv, the horror of what unfolded during the Russian occupation is finally coming to light. In the basement of a building that once housed a children's community centre, five bodies lay crumpled on the ground - five men dressed in civilian clothes, their hands bound behind their backs. Some were shot in the head, others in the chest. They were yet to be identified, but Ukrainian officials said the men were taken hostage by Russian soldiers and executed. ""We heard them being shot,"" said Vlad, one of the volunteers who carried the bodies up from the basement. ""We heard mines go off in the area. Around us there are mines. We are lucky we are alive."" Read more. Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has promised to zealously pursue allegations of war crimes against Russian forces in occupied regions of the country. Speaking during his nightly address to the Ukrainian people, Zelensky said investigators would do their upmost to identify the perpetrators of alleged atrocities. ""We are already doing everything possible to identify all the Russian military involved in these crimes as soon as possible,"" he said. ""This will be a joint work of our state with the European Union and international institutions, in particular with the International Criminal Court."" ""All crimes of the occupiers are documented. The necessary procedural basis is provided for bringing the guilty Russian military to justice for every crime they commit."" The Ukrainian leader added that he had discussed the status of the investigations with EU Commission President Ursula Von Der Leyen, Polish President Andrzej Duda and Austrian Chancellor Karl Nehammer. More from Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky, who has been addressing the Ukrainian people from his office in Kyiv. Zelensky accused Russian forces of killing and torturing more than 300 civilians in the formerly occupied city of Bucha, where evidence of alleged Russian war crimes have been discovered. The BBC cannot independently verify this claim. ""We have just begun an investigation into all that the occupiers have done,"" Zelensky said. ""At present, there is information about more than three hundred people killed and tortured in Bucha alone. It is likely that the list of victims will be much larger when the whole city is checked. And this is only one city."" ""There is already information that the number of victims of the occupiers may be even higher in Borodyanka and some other liberated cities,"" he went on. ""In many villages of the liberated districts of the Kyiv, Chernihiv and Sumy regions, the occupiers did things that the locals had not seen even during the Nazi occupation 80 years ago. The occupiers will definitely bear responsibility for this."" Ukraine's President Volodymyr Zelensky has said he will address an emergency meeting of the United Nations Security Council on Tuesday. Speaking during his nightly address to the Ukrainian people, Zelensky said it is in Kyiv's interest to have an open and transparent investigation into the alleged killing of civilians in Bucha. ""I would like to emphasise that we are interested in the
most complete, transparent investigation, the results of which
will be known and explained to the entire international
community,"" Zelensky said. Airbnb has completed its cancellation of operations in Russia and Belarus. The policy was announced on 3 March, preventing new reservations in the two countries
from that point forward, though the home rental company allowed a month for reservations that had already been booked. Travellers located in Russia and Belarus are unable to book stays at other Airbnb listings. The policy was first announced after Russian shelling sparked a fire at Europe's largest nuclear power plant, Zaporizhzhia. Belarus has served as a staging post for Russia's invasion of Ukraine. US and Spanish agents seized the ship on Monday US authorities say they have seized a yacht belonging to Viktor Vekselberg, an ally of Russia's President Vladimir Putin. According to a warrant, the Ukrainian-born oligarch violated 2018 sanctions placed on him by the US. He was again sanctioned last month after Russia's invasion. The 78-meter (255ft) luxury vessel named Tango and valued at $90m (Â£70m) was held in a raid by Spanish  police on the Mediterranean island of Mallorca, following a US request. The action was the first from the newly-created US Justice Department initiative dubbed Task Force KleptoCapture, which was created to punish Russian oligarchs for violating US sanctions. Officials allege Vekselberg continued to make payments through US banks for the support and maintenance of the Tango. ""Today marks our task forceâs first seizure of an asset belonging to a sanctioned individual with close ties to the Russian regime. It will not be the last,â said US Attorney General Merrick Garland. Civilians who fled Ukraine's capital, Kyiv, to safer regions should wait several more days before returning, the city's mayor, Vitaliy Klitschko, has said, according to Reuters. ""Firstly, there is currently a round-the-clock curfew in the Kyiv region,"" he was quoted as saying. ""Secondly, in certain towns near Kyiv, it's likely that Russian occupiers left landmines, and there are [likely] a lot of unexploded munitions."" Earlier, we reported that Klitschko brandedthe killings near the Ukrainian capital as horror scenes. Authorities in the Brovary, Bucha and Vyshhorod districts of the wider Kyiv region have also said that a curfew will remain in place until April 7, Ukrainian media report. They said that Ukrainian forces would spend the coming days clearing the area of ""explosive 'surprises' left behind by the invaders"". The Ukrainian intelligence service has published what itâ claims is a list of Russian personnel ""who committed war crimes against the people of Ukraine in Bucha"". The list, published on the website of the Ministry of Defense, included the names, dates of birth, passport numbers and ranks of about 2,000 servicemen. A message read: ""Remember! All war criminals will be brought to justice for crimes committed against the civilian population of Ukraine."" It comes after senior government sources told the BBC that the UK government is considering action to target captains, majors, and colonels in the Russian military. The measures could include sanctions as well as ways to hold individuals legally accountable forâ any crimes committed in Ukraine. Russiaâs ambassador to UN has insisted no civilians were harmed during the month-long Russian occupation of the Ukrainian town of Bucha - and accused Ukraine of fabricating evidence. As we've been reporting,the bodies of dozens of civilians as well as a mass gravehave been found following the withdrawal of Russian troops. But, speaking at a press conference in New York, Vasily Nebenzia said it was ""staged provocation"" by Western countries. He also accused the UK of ""unprecedented abuse"" in its role this month as president of the UN Security Council, said it was refusing to allow Russia to bring the Bucha incidents up. The BBC has verified footage in Buchain recent days and found the bodies in the streets would have been there for a number of days, and while the town was under Russian control. The BBC's Yogita Limaye visited the basement of a home in Bucha where the bodies of five men wearing civilian clothes were left. They had their hands bound behind their backs and appeared to have been shot. She also saw a shallow grave in the village of Motyzhyn - west of Kyiv - that contained the bodies of four people allegedly shot dead by Russian forces. Paul AdamsBBC Diplomatic correspondent A weekend of appalling images and harrowing stories has triggered a fresh wave of international outrage, and, inevitably, talk of more sanctions. No concrete announcements yet, butJoe Biden said those were coming and that heâd been right, in mid-March, to condemn Vladimir Putin in the harshest terms. War crimes trials may have to wait, but leaders agree new sanctions are needed. Franceâs president, Emmanuel Macron, has called for more measures to target Russian oil and coal. Germanyâs chancellor, Olaf Scholz, said Mr Putin and his supporters would, in his words, âfeel the consequencesâ of what happened in Bucha. The economy minister, Robert Habeck, said Germany was working towards an embargo on Russian energy, but that it couldnât happen immediately. The small Baltic republic of Lithuania is leading the way. After years of reducing its heavy reliance on Russian gas, its government announced, on Sunday, that imports had finally been reduced to zero. ""If we can do it,"" the countryâs president said, ""the rest of Europe can too"". The UK's foreign secretary, Liz Truss, said tough new sanctions will be announced at a meeting of G7 foreign ministers later this week. After meeting her Ukrainian counterpart in Warsaw, she said these would include banning Russian ships from western ports, cracking down further on Russian banks and going after new industries which she said were filling Mr Putinâs war chest, including gold. Since the withdrawal of Russian troops from Bucha, horrific images of bodies lying in the streets and accounts of killings have emerged. The reports have sparked widespread condemnation and the United Nations has called for an independent investigation into what happened in the town. Ukraine accused Russia of a ""deliberate massacre"" but Russia called it ""a staged provocation by the Kyiv regime"". It made a series of unfounded claims about the footage from Bucha, including that people shown are not actually dead and that no civilians in Bucha were harmed. The BBC has fact checked the claims. Read thefull report here.  The US State Department says the US is supporting a multi-national team of international prosecutors going to the region to collect, preserve and analyse evidence, at the request of Ukrainian officials. The aim is to pursue criminal accountability against Russia, a spokesperson for the State Department said. ""Those responsible for atrocities must be held accountable as must those who ordered them. ""They cannot and will not act with impunity."" They said the US is tracking and documenting atrocities and sharing information with institutions working to hold responsible those accountable.  France is the latest country to decide to expel Russian diplomatic staff, after its foreign ministry announced it was expelling many Russian diplomats. ""Their actions go against our national security interests,"" the French Ministry of Foreign Affairs said in a statement. ""This move is part of a European initiative."" The French news agency AFP quoted a source close to the Foreign Ministry as saying 35 people would be expelled. It follows a similar decision taken by Germanywhich expelled 40 Russian envoysover the killings of civilians in Bucha, near Ukraine's capital Kyiv. HARDtalkBBC News programme This video can not be played Ukraine war: Bucha massacre is a game changer - Ukraine foreign minister The killings in Bucha should be a ""game changer"" for the support the West is willing to provide Ukraine, the country's foreign minister has said. Speaking to the BBC's Hardtalk programme, Dmytro Kuleba said: ""The Bucha massacre should
remove any kind of hesitation and reluctance in the West to provide Ukraine
with all necessary weapons... to defend our country and to free it from the
Russian occupants."" He said additional support should include planes, tanks, multiple launch rocket systems, and armoured vehicles as well as a strengthening of sanctions against Russia. Kuleba added that the outcome of the war would be decided not only on the battleground, but in the ""offices in Europe and
North America"" where decisions about the level of additional support will be taken. ""I'm ready to exchange every word of sympathy
and admiration for a tank or a plane that will help me, or or an embargo on gas
and oil that will help me to save human lives in Ukraine,"" he said. A mass grave has been found outside a church in Bucha More now from the joint press conference this afternoon between UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss and her Ukrainian counterpart, Dmytro Kuleba. In addition to calling for a ""tough new wave of sanctions"" from the UK and its allies to stop Putin's war efforts, Truss backed Kuleba's call for Russia to be expelled from the European Human Rights Council after ""appalling crimes"" including the killing of civilians in Bucha. Kuleba said any G7 and EU nations countries that ""still have doubts"" and are continuing to trade with Russia - by buying fossil fuels, for example - should make their minds up by visiting any of the mass graves in Ukraine. The horrors seen in Bucha are ""just the tip of the iceberg"" of what war crimes have been committed by Russian forces, Kuleba added. ""I can tell you without exaggeration, but with great sorrow, that the situation in Mariupol is much worse,"" he said. Tens of thousands of civilians remain trapped in the south-eastern port city of Mariupol, which has been reduced to rubble by weeks of Russian shelling. Emily McGarveyBBC News Live reporter Olha Sukhenko, her son Oleksander and husband Igor were found dead more than a week after going missing As we've been reporting, a family who disappeared in their village west of Kyiv last month have been found dead in a shallow grave. Our correspondent, Yogita Limaye,visited the site, located in a wood near destroyed homes. Olha Sukhenko, her husband Igor and her son Oleksanderare alleged to have been shot dead by Russian soldiers.A fourth body was also found but has not been identified. Russian forces took Olha - who served as the head of her village of Motyzhyn - and her family  from their home on 23 March, an investigation by the Ukrainian chief prosecutor found. In Olha's last Facebook post before her death, posted in late February after the Russian invasion, she talked about there being ""someone else's scum in our village"" and warned residents to keep calm and not to leave their houses. Two days after the family were allegedly disappeared by Russian forces, a woman called Daria appealed on social media for information on their whereabouts, saying they were her ""second family"" and ""helped people to the end"". She said Russian forces had stolen Oleksander's car and were ""riding around the village"". After it emerged that the family had been killed, Daria posted
an update: I don't have enough words and strength to describe how I and my
whole family feel. This is a crime - in every sense. All involved will beappear
incourt. Referring to Oleksander, she wrote: Sasha, myHero.
You didn't leave your parents behind. You will forever be in my heart. In our
hearts. Heroes don't die. We've been hearing about the possibility of more sanctions against Russia in response to discoveries of civilian killings in northern Ukraine. New European sanctions could include measures targeting the Russian energy sector, according to European Commissioner for Economy, Paolo Gentiloni. ""Nothing is off the table and I think that this is more true now than ever,"" he said before a meeting with eurozone finance ministers to discuss possible new sanctions. Earlier, French President Emmanuel Macron called for further sanctionstargeting Russia's coal and oil exports, telling French media there were âclear indications of war crimes"". He did not mention targeting Russian gas, which accounts forabout 40% of the EU's natural gas imports. Tom BatemanReporting from Zaporizhzhia Weâve arrived at a refugee staging centre in the city of Zaporizhzhia at the same time as a long convoy of cars. Theyâve driven here across Russian lines from the south. Many have white cloth or scarves tied to the wing-mirrors to stop them being targeted. One has a makeshift red cross painted on a white piece of paper in the windscreen. Many are families. One woman is in tears as she tells me of her relief at fleeing to relative safety.

""This guy is brutal,"" Biden said, adding that he's seeking to bring in more sanctions against the Kremlin. The US president previously caused outrage in Moscow when he first accused Putin of war crimes last month. ""Well the truth of the matter, you saw what happened in Bucha - he is a war criminal... but we have to gather all the detail so this can have a war crimes trial,"" Biden said. Â© 2025 BBC.

The destruction to the town of Borodyanka is ""much more horrific"" than what has already been uncovered in nearby Bucha, Ukrainian President Volodymr Zelensky has said in his newest Facebook address to the nation late on Thursday. ""They have started sorting through the ruins in Borodyanka,"" Zelensky said in his remarks from Kyiv. ""It's much more horrific there. There are even more victims of Russian occupiers."" Both towns are suburbs of Kyiv and saw fierce fighting in the battle for the capital. This video can not be played Ukraine war: Destruction in the Ukrainian town of Borodyanka A building bombed by the Russian army in Borodyanka. Twenty-six bodies have been recovered from underneath the rubble of two destroyed apartment buildingsin Borodyanka, north west of Kyiv, according to Ukraine's prosecutor general. Iryna Venediktova accused Moscow of deliberately targeting civilian areas, in a post on Facebook. ""There is no military site here,"" she said, adding that Russian forces ""shelled residential infrastructure in the evenings, when there was a maximum amount of people home"". Venediktova claimed there was ""evidence of the Russian forces' war crimes at every turn"". Russia's Nobel Peace Prize winning journalist Dmitry Muratov says he has been attacked with red paint laced with the solvent acetone on a train in Russia.

Imogen FoulkesBBC News, Geneva Gennady Kuzmin, Russia's deputy Permanent Representative, speaks to the United Nations General Assembly Russiaâs suspension from the UN Human Rights Council is unprecedented. Never before has the General Assembly taken such action against a permanent member of the UN Security Council. The reports emerging from Ukraine have caused horror; an elected member of the human rights council (there are 47) is supposed to protect and promote human rights. The images from Bucha suggest Russian troops have been doing the opposite. That is why 93 UN member states backed the US-led move to suspend Russia. But there are 193 UN members, so less than half voted in favour: 58 abstained, 24 voted against, a further 18 were out of the room having what UN diplomats wryly call a ""strategic coffee break"". Western nations view Russiaâs suspension as essential if the UN is to fulfil its mandate on human rights, but others see it as deeply divisive. Some of the countries which abstained, among them South Africa, objected to taking this decision before the councilâs own inquiry into war crimes in Ukraine has even begun its work, let alone issued its report. And what about other elected council members, like China? Will it be suspended if UN human rights commissioner Michelle Bacheletâs long-awaited report into the treatment of the Uighur population reveals major violations? Today's vote is a huge blow for Russia, but itâs also an ominous reminder that the UN is finding it harder and harder to do its job. Yogita LimayeBBC News, Yahidne Mykola tied himself to a wall so he could sleep standing up. On the white, damp wall of the Yahidne school basement is a crude calendar, drawn in red crayon. It marks a period of unimaginable trauma - from 5 March to 2 April - for the people of this village. Yahidne, 140km (80 miles) north-west of Kyiv, which is close to the borders with Belarus and Russia, was occupied by Russian soldiers for nearly a month. They took men, women and children from their homes at gunpoint and held them in the basement of the local school for four weeks - around 130 people cramped into a room roughly 65 sq m (700 sq ft) in size. Sixty-year-old Mykola Klymchuk was one of them. He offered to show us the basement. ""This was my half a metre of space. I was sleeping standing up,"" he said. His voice choked up and he started crying. ""I tied myself to the railing here with my scarf so I wouldn't fall over. I spent 25 nights like this."" Mykola said you couldn't move for fear of stepping on people. About 40 or 50 children were among those held captive. The youngest was just two months old. ""During my time here, 12 people died,"" Mykola said. Most were elderly people. It's unclear what they died of, but Mykola believes some suffocated to death. When people died, the bodies couldn't immediately be removed. This meant that people, including children, lived amidst corpses for hours, and sometimes days, until they could be taken outside. Read the report in full: Ukraine war: Sharing space with the dead - horror outside Chernihiv The war has entered a ""new and different phase"", UK Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said, after today's meeting of Nato allies. Ms Truss said there was now ""a more concentrated Russian offensive"" in Ukraine, and Nato had agreed to supply new and heavier equipment to fight it. Speaking after the meeting of foreign ministers in Brussels, Ms Truss said: ""Putin has changed his tactics but not his intent. He wants a hold over the whole of Ukraine."" She earlier said the UK would be ""stepping up"" its supply of weapons but has not yet detailed what this would include. You can read abouther comments hereand we look at whatNato is and how it's helping Ukrainehere. Alice EvansBBC News Land warfare analyst Nick Reynolds, who works for the Royal United Services Institute (RUSI) think tank, has been filling us in on what the next few weeks of the war in Ukraine might look like, as Russia shifts its focus to the area in the south and east known as the Donbas. Was Ukraine's foreign minister accuratewhen he saidthe fighting in the Donbas could be reminiscent of World War Two? âYes I think thatâs accurate,"" Reynolds said. ""With all the forces freed up
from the north of Ukraineâ¦ weâre going to see a clash of arms on European soil
that hasnât been seen for generations."" Could Ukraine actually take back territory? There are a lot of unknown factors here, Reynolds says. Many Ukrainians will be buoyed up by the withdrawal of Russian forces in the north, but in the south and east âthe map has
still been slowly turning redâ, he says, and that's even before any reinforcements have arrived from the north. So Russia certainly still has some forwards momentum in the south and east, he says. How much difference could Western arms make? The weapons Western countries have so far sent to Ukraine have been game-changing but Nato has handed over a ""significant amount of its stocks - and that supply was finite"", Reynolds says. Western arms will be ""absolutely essential"" in the coming weeks but it's hard to know how they can get them to where they need to go, he adds. Ramping up industrial production of sophisticated weapons such as Javelins, NLAWs and Stingers is not easy, he says, as they have complex supply chains, He believes Western governments are struggling to keep up with demand. Switchblade dronescould âstart to change things on the ground within a short
timeframeâ â but thereâs âvery little elseâ that could do so, he adds. Paul AdamsBBC Diplomatic correspondent Ukrainian soldiers sit on a military vehicule in Severodonetsk, Donbas region. Ukrainian Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba isnât the only one warning of horrendous battles to come. Western military officials expect Russia to throw everything into an offensive in the Donbas, in an effort to secure something that Moscow can describe as a victory. The question is how long itâll take before the Russians are ready and whether Ukraine will be able to withstand the pressure when it comes. Hence the sense of urgency, with Kuleba warning on Thursday that additional military support must come in days, not weeks, saying that the three items on his agenda were ""weapons, weapons, and weapons"". He and Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberg are deliberately coy about what equipment is being sent. They donât want the Russians to know exactly what is being supplied, something that would help Moscow organise its attack. But the UK Foreign Secretary, Liz Truss, says thereâs support within Nato for sending ânew and heavier equipmentâ, and the MoD announced earlier that Ukrainian officials were in the UK earlier this week looking at âprotected mobility vehicles,â which could include the heavily armoured Mastiff patrol vehicle. With the Czech government sending Soviet-era T-72 tanks and the US announcing another $100m worth of Javelin anti-tank missiles, the flow of weapons is continuing, and the pace is picking up. If you are just joining us, or need a recap, here's what's happened so far today. In international diplomacy:  In Ukraine: Gennady Kuzmin, Russia Deputy Permanent Representative, speaks at the United Nations General Assembly. Moscow has said that the decision to suspend Russia from the United Nations Human Rights Council on Thursday was ""illegal"" and ""politically motivated"". The vote at the United Nations General Assembly saw 93 member states vote to suspend Russia (58 abstained and 24 voted against). Kremlin spokesman, Dmitry Peskov, told Sky News Russia was sorry about the decision and would continue to defend its interests ""using every possible legal means"". It was only the second ever suspension of a country from the Human Rights Council. The first was Libya in 2011. Damien McGuinnessBBC News, Berlin People walk through debris on a street in Bucha, following the withdrawal of Russian forces Russian soldiers can be heard talking about the murder of Ukrainian civilians in military radio traffic intercepted by Germany's foreign intelligence (BND), according to several separate media reports. The BND has audio material that appears to match the locations of bodies found in Bucha, the reports from German media say. In one, Russians appear to talk about interrogating people and then shooting them. In another, a soldier talks about shooting someone on a bike - which apparently matches a well-known photo showing a dead cyclist. The intelligence was shared with German parliamentarians during a briefing on Wednesday. However, a German security source told Reuters news agency that the findings on Bucha related to satellite images. âThe radio transmissions cannot be clearly assigned to Bucha."" A German
government spokesman confirmed Berlin has evidence that Russian troops
committed the atrocities. The reported intelligence also
appears to show evidence that Wagner mercenaries are also fighting for Russia
in Ukraine - backing upclaims made by British intelligenceearlier this week. The group has been active over the past eight years in Ukraine, Syria and African countries, and has repeatedly been accused of war crimes and human rights abuses. Russia has suffered ""significant losses of troops"", President Vladimir Putin's spokesman has said. Dmitry Peskov was asked on Sky News whether the war had been a ""humiliation"", given that Russia had retreated from the capital, lost thousands of troops and that President Volodymyr Zelensky was still in power. He said this was a ""wrong understanding"" of what was going on. But asked again if Russia has lost thousands of troops, he said: ""Yes, we have significant losses of troops and it's a huge tragedy for us."" He then added that the withdrawal from the Kyiv region and the northern city of Chernihiv was an ""act of goodwill"" to ""lift tension"" during peace talks. In the interview, Peskov repeated Russia's reasons for what it describes as a ""special military operation"", saying Ukraine had become ""anti-Russian"" and Russia was ""really nervous"" as Nato had ""started to move towards our boundaries"". Russia has previously said that 1,351 soldiers have been killed. The full death toll is not known, but a Nato official has been quoted in the US media as saying between 7,000 and 15,000, and there are similar US estimates. US Secretary of State Antony Blinken has been speaking
to reporters after todayâs meeting of Nato foreign ministers in Belgium. âThere is a greater determination than ever to stand with
Ukraine,â he said, and to inflict âeven greater costsâ on Russia for its
invasion. He also said for every Bucha - a city in which Russia has been accused of committing war crimes - there were likely to be more places in which atrocities were happening. Blinken also welcomed the earlier vote to suspend Russia
from the UN Human Rights Council, saying: âToday, a wrong was righted.â Ukraine's Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba has responded to the news that Russia has been suspended from the UN's Human Rights Council. Kulebasaid,external: ""War criminals have no place in UN bodies aimed at protecting human rights. Grateful to all member states which supported the relevant UNGA resolution and chose the right side of history."" More now on that vote moments ago to suspend Russia from the UNâs
Human Rights Council during a session in New York. Ninety-three countries voted
in favour of the move, 24 against, and there were 58 abstentions. Among the countries who supported the suspension were the
US, EU nations, the UK, and of course Ukraine itself. China, Syria, and Belarus were among those who voted against the motion. And India, Egypt, and South Africa were among the nations
which abstained. You can see the full list here,external.  The General Assembly of the United Nations has just voted to suspend Russia from its Human Rights Council during a session in New York. It follows allegations of war crimes by Kremlin troops in Ukraine. Before votes were cast, Ukraineâs ambassador to the UN Sergiy Kyslytsya accused Russia of âhorrificâ abuses â raising the issue of alleged civilian killings in the city of Bucha. Russiaâs own representative Gennady Kuzmin condemned the vote, and other nations including North Korea and Syria rallied behind him. Ukraine's Minister of Foreign Affairs Dmytro Kuleba speaking at the Nato meeting Nato Secretary General Jens Stoltenberghas statedthat allies are âready to do moreâ to provide military equipment and support to Ukraine. But Ukraineâs Foreign Minister Dmytro Kuleba, also speaking at a press conference earlier at Nato HQ in Brussels, said that help was needed in âdays not weeksâ if it was to avoid coming too late. Articulating the severity of the situation, Kuleba compared the unfolding fighting in the Donbas region to the Second World War. â[It] will remind you of the Second World War, with large operations... the involvement of thousands of tanks, armoured vehicles, planes, artillery.â He said this would ânot be a local operationâ based on current observations of Russian preparations. ""Russia has its plan, we have ours - and the outcome of this battle will be decided on the battlefield,"" he added. The Donbas is Ukraine's old coal and steel-producing area. The term refers to two big eastern regions, Luhansk and Donetsk. Russian-backed separatists declared ""republics"" in parts of the regions in 2014 and Russian forces have captured more territory since Vladimir Putin's invasion began in late February. Russian forces executed civilians in various locations in the Kyiv region, according to new testimonypublished by Amnesty International.,external The human rights organisation interviewed more than 20 people from towns and villages near the capital, some were witnesses to, or had direct knowledge of, the violence committed, it says. ""In recent weeks, we have gathered evidence that Russian forces have committed extrajudicial executions and other unlawful killings, which must be investigated as likely war crimes,"" says Amnesty International Secretary General AgnÃ¨s Callamard. ""Testimonies shows that unarmed civilians in Ukraine are being killed in their homes and streets in acts of unspeakable cruelty and shocking brutality."" In one account given, a woman in a village east of Kyiv told Amnesty two Russian soldiers entered her house on 9 March, killed her husband, then repeatedly raped her at gunpoint while her young son hid in a boiler room nearby. With Russian forces retreating from the north of Ukraine, disturbing
stories of life under occupation have been emerging. The BBC's Jeremy Bowen has
been told of Russian troops using villagers as human shields against Ukrainian
counter-attacks. Russia has repeatedly denied that its forces have committed
atrocities, and sought to point the finger of blame elsewhere. Â© 2025 BBC. The BBC is not responsible for the content of external sites.Read about our approach to external linking."
