"Reggae legend Bunny Wailer dies, aged 73","Bunny Wailer won three Grammys One of reggae's most important voices, Bunny Wailer, has died at the age of 73. The musician, from Kingston, Jamaica, was a founding member of The Wailers alongside his childhood friend, Bob Marley. Together, they achieved international fame with reggae classics like Simmer Down and Stir It Up, before Wailer left to go solo in 1974. He went on to win three Grammys and was given Jamaica's Order Of Merit in 2017. His death was confirmed by manager Maxine Stowe, and Jamaica's Culture Minister, Olivia Grange. The cause of death is unknown, but he had been in hospital since having a stroke in July 2020. Tributes have already poured in for the musician, with fans and fellow musicians describing him as a legend. ""This is one of the lowest moment in the history of our culture,"" wrote dancehall artist Shaggy on Facebook. ""You have made us proud king. Rest well."" ""Oh man, god bless Bunny Wailer,""wrote Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist, Flea,external.  ""What a true rocker and noble man. I love him."" Andrew Holness, Jamaica's prime minister, also paid tribute, calling his death ""a great loss for Jamaica and for reggae"". The original incarnation of The Wailers, circa 1964 (L-R): Bunny Wailer, Bob Marley and Peter Tosh The star, whose real name was Neville O'Riley Livingston, had been the last surviving member of The Wailers, following Bob Marley's death from cancer in 1981, and Peter Tosh's murder during a robbery in 1987. Born on 20 April 10, 1947, Livingston spent his earliest years in the village of Nine Mile, where he was raised by his father, Thaddeus, who ran a grocery store. That was where he first met Marley, and the toddlers soon became firm friends, making their first music together at Stepney Primary and Junior High School. Following the death of Marley's father in 1955, his mother, Cedella, moved in with Livingston's father. The boys were essentially raised as step-brothers, especially after Cedella and Thaddeus had a daughter together, Pearl. After moving to Trenchtown in Kingston, they met Peter Tosh and formed a vocal group called The Wailing Wailers - because, Marley said: ""We started out crying."" The area was poor and afflicted by violence. Livingston later remembered building his first guitar from ""a bamboo staff, the fine wires from an electric cable and a large sardine can"". But singer Joe Higgs, aka ""the Godfather of Reggae"", lived nearby and took the boys under his wing. Under his tutelage, they refined their sound, adding vocalist Junior Braithwaite and backing singers Beverly Kelso and Cherry Green before shortening their name to The Wailers. In December 1963, the band entered Coxsone Dodd's infamous Studio One to record Simmer Down, a song Marley had written calling for peace in the ghettos of Kingston. Faster and harder than the music The Wailers later became known for, the song was an immediate hit, reaching number one in Jamaica. They followed it up with the original version of Duppy Conqueror, before releasing their debut album The Wailing Wailers, in 1965. Allow YouTube content?

Soon after, the band went on hiatus as Marley got married and moved to the USA, and Livingston served a year in jail for marijuana possession. But they still managed to release 28 singles between 1966 and 1970, before releasing their second album, Soul Rebels. Their international breakthrough came three years later with Catch A Fire - the first record they made for Chris Blackwell's Island Records. The collaboration came about almost by accident. The Wailers had been touring the UK with Johnny Nash - who'd had a hit with a cover of Stir It Up - but found themselves unable to pay for their trip home. Blackwell offered to sign the band to Island, paying them an advance to cover their air fares and cost of recording an album in Jamaica. Much to the band's displeasure, some of the songs were overdubbed to make them more palatable to an international audience. ""I felt the way to break the Wailers was as a black rock act; I wanted some rock elements in there,"" Blackwell later told Rolling Stone. ""Bunny and Peter didn't want to leave Jamaica, so Bob came to England when we did the overdubs."" The album was not a major seller and failed to chart in both the US and UK - but it has become widely recognised as a classic. Rolling Stone magazine recently placed it at number 140 in its list of the500 greatest albums of all time,external, writing ""the Wailers' ghetto rage comes across uncut"" in  songs like Concrete Jungle and Slave Driver.

Commercial success followed with 1973's Burnin', which featured classic cuts like I Shot The Sheriff, Small Axe and Get Up, Stand Up. However, it was to be the Wailers last album to feature the original Wailers line-up. Tensions already present were exacerbated by Island marketing their albums under the name Bob Marley and The Wailers, and a touring schedule that kept Livingston away from his family. He eventually left in 1973, saying the touring lifestyle clashed with his Rastafarian beliefs - citing the pressure to eat processed foods and play ""freak clubs"". He later said fame was the enemy of creativity. ""Music is based on inspiration and if you're in an environment where you are up and down, here and there, that's how your music is going to sound,"" Livingston told The Los Angeles Times in 1986. ""People get taken away in getting themselves to be a star and that is a different thing from getting yourself to be a good writer, musician, producer and arranger."" The star was known as an elder statesman of reggae Free from the band, he began to work on his solo album Blackheart Man, which included classic songs like Dreamland and Fighting Against Conviction, which was inspired by his stint in prison. He went on to release several acclaimed albums, including 1981's Rock 'n' Groove and 1980s's Bunny Wailer Sings The Wailers, which saw him revisit some of the band's classic material. In the 1990s, he won the Grammy award for best reggae album three times - with each of those records extending and preserving the legacy of Marley and the Wailers:  1991's Time Will Tell: A Tribute to Bob Marley, 1995's Crucial! Roots Classics, and the 1997's all-star Hall of Fame: A Tribute to Bob Marley's 50th Anniversary. ""I'm satisfied with knowing that I'm serving the purpose of getting reggae music to be where it's at,""he told the Washington Post in 2006,external. ""I'm proud to be part of that.""

Texas to end mask mandate and lift Covid rules,"States across the US have started to ease Covid-19 restrictions, causing concern among health officials Texas will lift its mask requirement and allow businesses to reopen at full capacity next week, Governor Greg Abbott has announced. ""It is now time to open Texas 100%,"" the Republican said on Tuesday. Texas is the largest US state to end its mask mandate. Mr Abbott has faced criticism from his party over the measure, which was imposed last July. But the administration of US President Joe Biden has made it clear coronavirus restrictions are still necessary. The announcement in Texas came as similar rules were lifted in other states, including Michigan, Louisiana, and Mississippi, which also ended its mask mandate. The roll-out of vaccinations against Covid-19 has boosted confidence in a return to pre-pandemic life in the US. On Tuesday, President Biden said the US was on track to have enough vaccines for every adult in the country by the end of May. Yet the wave of reopenings has put states at odds with the Biden administration and its senior health officials, who have reacted with dismay to the relaxation of coronavirus measures at a precarious time in the pandemic. Covid-19 variants pose 'real threat' to vaccine progress, CDC warns Biden calls 500,000 death toll a heartbreaking milestone On Monday the director of the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) warned of a ""potential fourth surge of cases"" if the country lapsed into complacency. Covid-19 data shows that, while infections and deaths have declined in recent weeks, they are still at high levels relative to other countries. In total, the US has recorded more than 28 million infections and 516,000 deaths related to Covid-19, according to data collated by Johns Hopkins University. Mr Abbott issued an executive order that rescinded most of the coronavirus measures he imposed earlier in the pandemic. Thenew executive order,external, which is to take effect on 10 March, lifts all mask requirements and forbids local authorities from penalising residents who do not wear a face covering. It removes all restrictions on businesses in counties without a high number of Covid-19 patients in hospital. Mr Abbott has been under pressure to lift the restrictions ""Too many Texans have been sidelined from employment opportunities,"" Mr Abbott said in a speech at the Chamber of Commerce in the city of Lubbock. ""Too many small business owners have struggled to pay their bills. This must end."" He said that with increased vaccinations and improved treatment for Covid-19, the state was ""in a far better position now"". But, he added, ""Covid has not suddenly disappeared"". Following weeks of decline, coronavirus infections and related deaths are creeping up again in Texas,data from the Covid Tracking Project showed,external. Texas has recorded more than 43,000 deaths related to Covid-19, the third-highest state toll in the US. This video can not be played The 'colourful' lives lost to Covid - how obituaries are helping us all mourn Angelica Casas, reporting from San Antonio, Texas Governor Abbott's announcement was no surprise to Texans. After all, the state's pandemic response has been political from the start. The state's Republican leadership favoured former President Donald Trump's relatively relaxed approach to imposing restrictions. But that created tension with local officials in the state's major cities, which all lean Democrat. It was control of the disease vs control of the economy. Mask requirements vs maintaining personal liberties. And when the surges came, state politicians were more reactive than proactive. A year later, not much has changed. The state's death toll and current case rate are still among the highest in the US. That's why critics say Governor Abbott's decision does not follow the science. So the decision will be a test to the state - but also to Mr Abbott's relationship with President Biden, who has addressed the pandemic with more urgency than his predecessor. Individual states are in charge of public health policy in the US. At the start of the coronavirus pandemic, most introduced restrictions on businesses and travel. About 35 required face coverings to be worn in public places - either indoors or outdoors - although enforcement of these mask mandates has been patchy. With cases and deaths falling sharply in recent weeks, several states have begun easing the restrictions. Shortly after Mr Abbott's announcement, Mississippi Governor Tate Reeves said he would do the same in an even shorter time frame. ""Starting tomorrow, we are lifting all of our county mask mandates and businesses will be able to operate at full capacity without any state-imposed rules,"" Mr Reeves said. Health experts have warned that the pandemic was far from over and cases could pick up if curbs were lifted too soon. President Biden has urged Americans to remain vigilant against the threat of the virus President Biden - in contrast with his predecessor Mr Trump - has made fighting the virus a priority for his administration. On Tuesday, Mr Biden said he was upbeat about reaching his goal of delivering 100 million Covid-19 vaccine doses in his first 100 days in office, but urged Americans to remain vigilant in wearing masks and observing social distancing. ""Today's announcements are a huge step in our effort to beat this pandemic,"" Biden said in a televised statement from the White House. ""But I have to be honest with you. This fight is far from over."" The 28.7 million total confirmed US infections is nearly double that of second-highest India (11 million) and Brazil (10.5 million),according to Johns Hopkins University research,external But the US ranks ninth in terms of deaths per 100,000 population, behind countries such as the UK and Italy At least 90,000 more Americans are expected to have died with the virus by 1 June, an Institute for Health Metrics and Evaluation (IHME) projection says. By late May, the virus will kill around 500 Americans per day - down from approximately 2,000 now Hospital admission rates have fallen sharply since January The growing number of new variants, which could spark further outbreaks, remains a concern LA fire chief warns of further destruction from high winds as 10 confirmed dead What's the latest on the LA fires, and why can't they be put out?

Circuit-breaker lockdown for Isle of Man,"Restrictions will come into force at 00:01 GMT on Wednesday A 21-day ""circuit-breaker"" lockdown has been announced to limit the spread of Covid-19 on the Isle of Man, the chief minister has said. The island has seen a rise in cases in recent days, with some stemming froman infected ferry crew member. Howard Quayle said an increase in other - unexplained - cases indicated there was transmission ""that we cannot see and do not understand"". The new restrictions came into force at midnight. Under the new measures, people are required to stay at home unless for exercise or essential travel, avoid mixing with other households and socially distance when outside. Schools are shut to most pupils and non-essential businesses are required to close. And all hospitality and leisure venues have also shut their doors to customers although takeaway and delivery services are still allowed. People are required to stay at home except for exercise or essential travel Edward Cox, who owns the Front Porch bar in Douglas, said the lockdown was the right decision but it was ""absolutely gutting"". He added that he felt the government was not ""prepared enough"" for another outbreak and the island ""should never have got to this position"". The Â£1,500 in government support offered would ""not touch the sides"" and he would be forced to throw out large quantities of fresh food, he added. Unlikethe January lockdown, construction work is allowed to continue provided it is outdoors or in a vacant property. Financial support measures, which were put in place during the island's previous two lockdown periods, have been reactivated. In recent days, the island has seen a small number of confirmed Covid-19 cases where the source is not known, one of them in a school. Bill Shimmins MHK said the government's response to the current cluster of cases was ""akin to a slow-motion train crash"". He added that, had measures been imposed earlier, it would have avoided ""this incredibly damaging lockdown"". More than 40 Covid-19 cases have been linked to the cluster involving the ferry crew member, who tested positive for the virus on 18 February. Officials believed it was largely under control, but five unexplained cases have been identified since Friday. Mr Quayle said there was insufficient data to support measures being taken earlier and the response had to be ""proportionate"". There are currently 52 active cases of Covid-19 on the Isle of Man.

BBC Three will return to TV screens after six years,"BBC Three is set to return as a TV channel BBC Three will return as a fully-fledged TV channel in January 2022, six years after it moved online. The channel has since been responsible for major hits including Fleabag, Normal People and Killing Eve - prompting calls for its resurrection. Last year, BBC research concluded there was a ""strong case"" for it to come back as a regular TV channel, focusing on younger audiences. MP Julian Knight said the move showed the BBC had ""failed"" those viewers. ""I question whether putting the clock back five years is the right way to win over 18-35s,"" said Mr Knight, who chairs the select committee for the department for digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS). ""The BBC needs to back success and make sure its programmes reach as many young people as possible wherever they live in the UK,"" said the BBC's chief content officer, Charlotte Moore. ""So regardless of the debates about the past, we want to give BBC Three its own broadcast channel again."" As announced in the BBC's Annual Plan last year, the channel's budget will also be doubled over the next two years - a decision that was also criticised by Mr Knight, who accused the BBC of putting extra investment into programmes while ""those over 75 are being chased to pay up for their TV licences"". The BBC ended the provision of free TV licences for most over-75s last year, after the government decided to stop paying for the benefit. RuPaul's Drag Race UK, currently in its second season, has proved a runaway success When it returns, BBC Three will be targeted at audiences aged 16-34, broadcasting from 19:00 to 04:00 each day. As a result, CBBC's broadcast hours will revert to closing at 19:00 - as was the case before 2016. It currently runs until 21:00. The move will still need approval from media regulator Ofcom before it can go ahead. Seven years ago the BBC announced that BBC Three would become digital only. The main reason given was the need to save money. The public narrative was: Young audiences congregate online rather than watch linear TV, so there's no point providing a linear service. Since then, three things have happened. The flight of young audiences to digital platforms, and away from scheduled TV, has accelerated. BBC Three has produced a big range of huge, global hits. And the pressure on the BBC, not least from Ofcom, to prove that it still appeals to young people has grown sharply. This last point is critical. The BBC commissioned research showing that there is still a market of young people - albeit smaller than years ago - on linear platforms. Given the success of the shows commissioned by BBC Three, the feeling at the top of the organisation was that putting them back on a linear platform would create upside in terms of audience numbers, for relatively low cost. Despite the need for more savings today, that cost can be justified because when the BBC negotiates with the government over the future of the licence fee, it needs the strongest possible argument on its relevance and universal appeal. BBC Three was originally taken off air in March 2016. The corporation said the move would save Â£30m a year, helping it to reduce its spending after cuts imposed by the government in 2010. Much of the budget was reallocated to fund drama on BBC One, while BBC Three was expected to target younger audiences online. But the plans caused controversy, prompting the Save BBC Three campaign which saw more than 300,000 people sign a petition to keep it on air. Journalist and founder of the campaign Jono Read said the channel's return was ""great news"". ""It became clear that the decision to to take it off air was a counter-productive move that bosses had taken to sacrifice the station under the guise of budget cuts, and one that was deeply unpopular with its audience. ""Nonetheless the online move has shown real potential for BBC Three and I think it will thrive when it is once again given the chance to combine traditional and new media when it returns to TV in 2022"", he says. Many of BBC Three's commissions have ended up on linear TV, with shows like Killing Eve and Fleabag attracting huge audiences on BBC One. Paul Mescal and Daisy Edgar-Jones in BBC Three's Normal People Normal People, about the tangled love lives of two Irish teenagers, also became the breakout hit of the first lockdown. It was requested on the BBC iPlayer 62.7 million times last year, more than any other programme. Other hit shows on the channel include Man Like Mobeen, This Country, Ru Paul's Drag Race UK and the Jesy Nelson documentary Odd One Out. In its online incarnation, BBC Three has won a raft of awards, including RTS Channel of the Year in 2017 and Digital Channel of the Year 2019 at the Edinburgh TV Festival. It is currently Broadcast Digital Channel of the Year. Follow us onFacebook,external, or on Twitter@BBCNewsEnts,external. If you have a story suggestion emailentertainment.news@bbc.co.uk,external.

Furlough scheme to be extended until September,"The furlough scheme will be extended until the end of September by the chancellor in the Budget later. Rishi Sunak said the scheme - which pays 80% of employees' wages for the hours they cannot work in the pandemic - would help millions through ""the challenging months ahead"". Some 600,000 more self-employed people will also be eligible for government help as access to grants is widened. But Labour said the support schemes should have been extended ""months ago"". The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme has protected more than 11 million jobs since its inception last March and had been due to close at the end of April. It has been credited for slowing the pace of job losses as tens of thousands of businesses remain shut. Employers will be expected to pay 10% towards the hours their staff do not work in July, increasing to 20% in August and September, as the economy reopens. Government support for self-employed people has also been extended until September. A fourth grant under the Self-Employment Income Support Scheme (SEISS) scheme will run from February until April, covering up to 80% of three months' trading profits up to Â£7,500. There will be a fifth grant from May to September. People whose turnover has fallen by 30% or more will get the 80% grant, but self-employed people whose turnover has fallen by less than 30% will get a 30% grant. The government is widening access to grants, meaning some 600,000 more self-employed people will be eligible. People who filed their tax returns for 2019-20 by midnight on Tuesday are now eligible. Speaking ahead of the Budget, the chancellor said: ""Our Covid support schemes have been a lifeline to millions, protecting jobs and incomes across the UK. ""There's now light at the end of the tunnel with a roadmap for reopening, so it's only right that we continue to help business and individuals through the challenging months ahead - and beyond."" However, he is expected to warn in his Budget that there are tough economic times ahead. Can I go on furlough and how does it work? What help will the self-employed get in the Budget? Five things to look out for in the Budget What we know so far about the Budget Are you currently on furlough?  Share your experiences.

Official confirmation of a pandemic came hours after its publication, swiftly rendering most of its numbers obsolete. But so far in this crisis, unemployment has gone up only modestly. Furlough and the separate support scheme for the self-employed have prevented mass unemployment. These extensions now aim to prevent a rapid rise in joblessness at the end of the schemes. The BBC understands that unemployment forecasts will be revised down on Wednesday as the chancellor promises to deploy his ""full fiscal firepower"" to ""protect livelihoods"" - the theme of the Budget red book. At more than Â£10bn, this intervention is almost worthy of a Budget in and of itself. But the full document will reveal whether the chancellor's borrowing spree is limited to the ""rescue phase"" of this crisis, or if his confidence in a jobs bounce-back means the economy does not need further stimulus and could even sustain some business-focused tax rises. After the jabs, the jobs are the great hope. Economic think tank the Resolution Foundation's chief executive, Torsten Bell, said the phased tapering-off of the furlough scheme would avoid a ""risky cliff-edge"" for employers, but warned that the ""peak of unemployment is ahead rather than behind us"". However, Bridget Phillipson, Labour's shadow chief secretary to the Treasury, said the changes to support schemes ""could have been made months ago"" - accusing Mr Sunak of focusing on ""getting his moment in the sun rather than protecting jobs and livelihoods"". The SNP leader in Westminster, Ian Blackford, has said furlough must be in place  ""as long as businesses and devolved governments need it"". He said he was ""concerned companies are going to have to step in and pay greater contributions"". And Len McCluskey, general secretary of the Unite union, said that while the extra months of furlough support offer ""some stability in the rocky months ahead"", the scheme should be extended until 2022. But Chris Wootton, chief financial officer at Sports Direct, said that although the furlough extension was helpful, other assistance was needed for businesses such as his, chiefly through business rates, payment of which has been suspended for almost a year. He told the BBC: ""What we really want is structural reform. This is just kicking the can down the road. ""We don't know what the systemic changes to consumer behaviour are going to be. We said even before Covid happened that a number of House of Fraser stores where we're working very closely with landlords, paying zero rent, they are still losing money because the business rates are far from fair.""

The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, or furlough scheme, applies across the UK. It covers up to 80% of an employee's salary for the hours they can't work, up to a maximum of Â£2,500 per month. How does the furlough scheme work? What help is available for the self-employed? As Covid restrictions start to lift, employers will have to help cover part of the cost of their furloughed workers' salaries. They already have to pay pension and National Insurance contributions. Employees will continue to receive 80% of their salary for hours not worked until the scheme ends. More support will also be announced for self-employed workers on Wednesday, with more than 600,000 people, many of them newly self-employed last year, now eligible for cash grants. Pubs and other hospitality venues have been battered by the pandemic, so the chancellor has promised a Â£150m pot to help communities take over local ""boozers"" at threat of closure. Under the fund, which will open in the summer, community groups will be able to bid for up to Â£250,000 of matched-funding to help them to buy local pubs to run as community-owned businesses. In ""exceptional cases"" up to Â£1m will be available to community groups to buy their  local sports club. Mr Sunak said it would help keep such venues at ""the heart and soul of our local towns and villages"". When can pubs and restaurants reopen? Tens of thousands of small businesses will be offered free MBA-style management training to help them boost productivity growth, the Chancellor has said. Under the so called ""Help to Grow"" scheme, the government will plough Â£520m into free online courses from top business schools. It will also fund 50% discounts on new productivity-enhancing software. What is the Budget and when will it happen? How much will coronavirus cost the UK? The England and Wales Cricket Board has said the game could lose up to Â£200m because of Covid Mr Sunak will announce a Â£300m recovery package for sport, another sector battered by social distancing restrictions. The self professed cricket fan says his beloved sportwill get a ""significant chunk"" of this cash, after last season was played behind closed doors. Other sports such as tennis and horse racing will also benefit. He has also promised Â£25m of new funding to support grassroots football - enough to build around 700 new pitches across the UK, as well as cash to kick-start a 2030 UK and Ireland World Cup bid. The arts sector has struggled since last March, as gig venues, museums and cinemas have been forced to close. Many who work in the sector are freelancers who have fallen through the cracks of support for the self-employed. In the Budget the chancellor is expected to put an extra Â£300m into the Â£1.57bn Culture Recovery Fund, with England's museums and cultural bodies also receiving Â£90m to keep going until they can open their doors on 17 May at the earliest. There will also be Â£18.8m for community cultural projects, and Â£77m for similar initiatives in the devolved nations. How could the Budget affect universal credit? The chancellor is to unveil details of a Â£5bn grant scheme to help struggling High Street shops and hospitality firms in England reopen after lockdown. The chancellor said the grants would be worth as much as Â£18,000 per firm, but some business groups say the money is not enough. Nearly 700,000 shops, restaurants, hotels, hair salons, gyms and other businesses in England, will be eligible for the so-called ""restart grants"", to be distributed directly to firms by local authorities from April. It will replace the current monthly grant system. The UK's Covid vaccination rollout will receive an extra Â£1.65bn in the Budget to help it reach its target of offering a first dose to every adult by 31 July. Over 20 million people in the UK have had a first dose and NHS England is now asking 60 to 63-year-olds to book jabs. Rishi Sunak said it was ""essential we maintain this momentum"". The Budget will also include a mortgage guarantee scheme to help people with small deposits get on the property ladder. The government will offer incentives to lenders, bringing back 95% mortgages which have ""virtually disappeared"" during the pandemic, the Treasury says. The new scheme is not restricted to first-time buyers or new-build homes, but there will be a Â£600,000 limit. It is based on the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme, which closed to new loans at the end of 2016. The Treasury said the scheme ""reinvigorated the market for high loan-to-value lending after the 2008 financial crisis"". But housing charity Shelter said that scheme increased house prices by 1.4%. The Chancellor will announced a ""fast-track"" visa scheme to help start-up and rapidly growing tech firms source talent from overseas. Applicants will no longer need to obtain a ""third-party endorsement"" or be backed by a sponsor organisation, simplifying the current rules and making it easier for researchers, engineers and scientists to come to the UK. Mr Sunak will plough an extra Â£126m into the traineeship scheme, which sees the government pay employers who give young people work placements. Currently the government pays firms Â£2,000 per trainee, but this will rise to Â£3,000. He'll also create a new ""flexi-job"" apprenticeship in England that will enable apprentices to work with a number of different employers in one sector. What is the Budget and when will it happen?

What is the furlough scheme?,"The furlough scheme, which protected millions of jobs during the pandemic, is being wound up at the end of September. The government has been paying towards the wages of people who couldn't work, or whose employers could no longer afford to pay them, up to a monthly limit of Â£2,500. At first it paid 80% of the wages, but in August and September it paid 60%, with employers paying 20%. The most recent figures show1.6 million people were on furlough at the end of July- the lowest level since the start of the pandemic and 340,000 fewer than a month earlier. Nearlyone million workers were expected to still be on the scheme at the end of September, according to research by the Resolution Foundation. The numbers have dropped as the economy reopened. In May 2020, nearly nine million people were on furlough. What impact has the furlough scheme had? High numbers of workers in restaurants and hotels were furloughed Some employers with workers on furlough may find they cannot afford to keep them on when furlough ends. International travel, and other businesses which depend on it, are still seriously disrupted. Some furloughed workers in these areas may lose their jobs. Many forecasters, including the Bank of England, are expecting a small rise in unemployment. How many people could lose their jobs? How do I find a new job and who is hiring? If you were made redundant while on furlough, you have a number of legal rights. The selection process must be fair, you must be given notice, and you are entitled to tax-free redundancy pay. Government guidance: Furlough and redundancy,external Government guidance: Redundancy and benefits,external What are my rights if I am made redundant? If you've been made redundant - or been told that you will soon be made redundant - there are three main types of financial support that you may be entitled to: Universal credit,external New Style Jobseeker's Allowance,external(New Style JSA), or New Style Employment and Support Allowance,external(New Style ESA) You might be able to claim a combination of these benefits. The amount of help you get depends on your personal circumstances, including the amount of national insurance contributions you made while you were employed.

That's a huge sum, around one fifth of the money the government has spent on the response to Covid. The Chancellor, Rishi Sunak, launched the furlough scheme in March 2020 However, the scheme has undoubtedly helped to save millions of jobs.

Â£1.1bn extra spending in new Welsh budget plansMinisters will set aside Â£200m for businesses and Â£224m for infrastructure including housing.Wales politicsComments,"The Welsh Government will have just over Â£17bn to spend in the next financial year Welsh ministers have confirmed plans to spend an extra Â£1.1bn in the next financial year. The final budget for 2021-22,externalincludes an extra Â£224m for housing, schools and other infrastructure, and Â£630m for the NHS and councils. Meanwhile Â£200m will be set aside to support businesses. Welsh Conservatives say business rate relief should continue, but ministers want to see what the chancellor will announce for England first. The Welsh Government said it is waiting to hear what Rishi Sunak says about business rates in his UK government budget speech on Wednesday, and what that means for Wales. It comes as the cash Welsh ministers expect to receive for Covid-19 spending from the UK government is expected to be less than a sixth of the Â£5bn it has had for 2020-21. Plaid Cymru said Â£200m was a ""drop in the ocean"" for businesses. Wales to receive extra Â£650m from Treasury Extra Â£1.6bn for Covid vaccine rollout Second homes tax hike for Wales spending plan The Welsh Government has finalised its spending plans for 2021-22, which they began to spell out in draft form last December and is worth more than Â£17bn. In the first financial year of the pandemic, Wales was given an extra Â£5bn to spend on Covid by the UK government. Under current plans, this is expected to fall to Â£766m.Ministers only announced plans for how they would spend 10% of thatin December. Since then, another Â£650m has been announced by the Treasury for the Welsh Government as a result of additional Covid spending in England. The final budget confirms some of the extra items that the Welsh Government is spending money on, with the pots of money it had left over from last year. Money for the pandemic is additional to the Â£17bn the Welsh Government spends on other policies. It has control in Wales of the NHS, education, environmental spending and transport. Some of the cash will be used for the Welsh Government's vaccination programme The Welsh Government says it is setting aside Â£200m extra for businesses in its reserves. It is not decided how that will be spent, and it is not yet clear if an existing business rate relief scheme will continue into the next financial year. All retail, leisure and hospitality businesses with a rateable value of Â£500,000 or below are receiving 100% non-domestic rates relief until the end of March. A similar scheme is operational in England and reports suggest it will continue - Welsh ministers say they are waiting to see how much extra money there is from the Treasury on Wednesday. Rebecca Evans told BBC Wales the scheme has cost around Â£360m in the current financial year. ""We would love the chancellor to say that he is intending to continue with the rate relief system,"" she said. But she said the ""sheer"" amount of funding to continue to offer it in Wales means it would need extra money from the UK government. Most firms closed by lockdown are still awaiting a date on when they can reopen. Mark Newbold, who owns two pubs near Bridgend, called for more clarity on support for the hospitality sector. ""I know they've put away Â£200m but that's not enough to support the whole industry,"" he said. ""There are so many businesses that have lost so much money especially last year with the great summer we had."" This video can not be played First Minister Mark Drakeford announced some of the cash at a press conference on Monday The Welsh Government says it is allocating another Â£224.5m on capital funding - cash spent on infrastructure. That includes Â£147m on housing programmes and Â£30m for new schools. An extra Â£8m will be given to councils and Natural Resources Wales to repair damage caused by flooding in December and January, and on wider flooding protection work. Another Â£20m will be earmarked for walking and cycling routes, which the Welsh Government said would increase total investment in active travel for the year to Â£75m. Housing schemes will be among the beneficiaries of the final budget At a press conference on Monday, First Minister Mark Drakeford announced Â£682m in new spending, with some of the money being used to support the vaccination programme. A total of Â£630m will go on the NHS and councils, including Â£206m for a local government hardship fund to support social care and ensure schools can adapt. NHS services will get Â£380m, and contact tracing will receive Â£50m. Another Â£10.5m will go to supporting vulnerable people, while Â£18.6m will be spent on public transport. Welsh Conservative finance spokesman Mark Isherwood said: ""The pandemic has devastated the Welsh economy and people and businesses are crying out for more support from Labour ministers so we can support families and save Welsh jobs, but those cries have been sadly ignored. ""After over two decades in power and numerous budgets, successive Labour Governments in Cardiff Bay have failed to deliver for hardworking people, and sadly there's little reason to believe that this budget will be any different - it will only take us back to the same old normal under Labour."" Plaid Cymru economy spokeswoman Helen Mary Jones said there were ""large gaps"" in the budget. ""By refusing to extend the eligibility criteria for free school meals and to freeze council tax, Labour is failing to protect the most vulnerable from the impact of the pandemic."" She added: ""Â£200m is but a drop in the ocean for businesses who are, like the hospitality sector, on their knees and kept awake at night fearing closure and redundancies."" Most of the cash the Welsh Government spends comes directly from the Treasury in London, but about 17% is raised through devolved taxes. They include part of income tax, land transaction tax - the Welsh version of stamp duty - and landfill tax. Among the announcements in December was a tax hike on second homes, to raise Â£13m for social housing. Although this is called the final budget for the coming financial year, the reality is that it's likely to see many more amendments in the months to come. The pandemic remains unpredictable, as does the state of the economy, so some of the most recent spending commitments are for a six-month period. The chancellor's budget on Wednesday will change things too. If the reports of an extension to the business rate holiday in England are correct, Welsh Government may well follow suit here - new spending decisions for England mean more money on the way to Wales. And there's a Senedd election looming in May, so there may be a few late Easter bunnies being pulled out of hats. What's more, a change of government - or a new coalition agreement - would mean changed spending priorities.

What we know so far about the Budget,"There will be cash to help people take over local pubs at risk of closure Chancellor Rishi Sunak will set out the government's tax and spending plans on Wednesday afternoon, and rumours are rife about what giveaways and cuts lie in wait. However, he has also announced a number of his plans ahead of the speech. Here is what we know already: As the pandemic has upended many people's working lives,the furlough scheme will be extendeduntil the end of September. The Coronavirus Job Retention Scheme, or furlough scheme, applies across the UK. It covers up to 80% of an employee's salary for the hours they can't work, up to a maximum of Â£2,500 per month. How does the furlough scheme work? What help is available for the self-employed? As Covid restrictions start to lift, employers will have to help cover part of the cost of their furloughed workers' salaries. They already have to pay pension and National Insurance contributions. Employees will continue to receive 80% of their salary for hours not worked until the scheme ends. More support will also be announced for self-employed workers on Wednesday, with more than 600,000 people, many of them newly self-employed last year, now eligible for cash grants. Pubs and other hospitality venues have been battered by the pandemic, so the chancellor has promised a Â£150m pot to help communities take over local ""boozers"" at threat of closure. Under the fund, which will open in the summer, community groups will be able to bid for up to Â£250,000 of matched-funding to help them to buy local pubs to run as community-owned businesses. In ""exceptional cases"" up to Â£1m will be available to community groups to buy their  local sports club. Mr Sunak said it would help keep such venues at ""the heart and soul of our local towns and villages"". When can pubs and restaurants reopen? Tens of thousands of small businesses will be offered free MBA-style management training to help them boost productivity growth, the Chancellor has said. Under the so called ""Help to Grow"" scheme, the government will plough Â£520m into free online courses from top business schools. It will also fund 50% discounts on new productivity-enhancing software. What is the Budget and when will it happen? How much will coronavirus cost the UK? The England and Wales Cricket Board has said the game could lose up to Â£200m because of Covid Mr Sunak will announce a Â£300m recovery package for sport, another sector battered by social distancing restrictions. The self professed cricket fan says his beloved sportwill get a ""significant chunk"" of this cash, after last season was played behind closed doors. Other sports such as tennis and horse racing will also benefit. He has also promised Â£25m of new funding to support grassroots football - enough to build around 700 new pitches across the UK, as well as cash to kick-start a 2030 UK and Ireland World Cup bid. The arts sector has struggled since last March, as gig venues, museums and cinemas have been forced to close. Many who work in the sector are freelancers who have fallen through the cracks of support for the self-employed. In the Budget the chancellor is expected to put an extra Â£300m into the Â£1.57bn Culture Recovery Fund, with England's museums and cultural bodies also receiving Â£90m to keep going until they can open their doors on 17 May at the earliest.

The Salmond and Sturgeon story,"For 10 years Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon showed how to be a successful political duo. They campaigned hard, won elections and brought to the fore a shared dream of Scottish independence. That irresistible combo is gone, having given way to personal silences and a public war of words. As MSPs continue investigating the Scottish government's mishandling of complaints against Mr Salmond, we look at their story. As the clock ticked past midday, I waited in the first minister's walnut panelled office for Nicola Sturgeon to give her first interview on the scandal. It was Friday 24 August 2018 - the day theDaily Record splashed on allegations of sexual misconduct,externalmade against her predecessor, Alex Salmond. The first minister was said to be so upset that her advisers worried she might cry on camera. When it came to it, Nicola Sturgeon kept her composure but there was clear emotion in the interview that followed. Her voice wavered slightly when she told me how ""incredibly difficult"" the situation was. At about the time she was speaking to me, Alex Salmond was telling journalists gathered around a Linlithgow pub table that while he was ""no saint"" he had not harassed anyone. In a pub in Linlithgow, the town where he was born, Alex Salmond told a gathered media he was ""no saint"" but he was not guilty of anything criminal The Scottish government had investigated complaints about him from two civil servants, under a new procedure signed off by Nicola Sturgeon. That was not news to the first minister because Alex Salmond had told her privately about the investigation several months before. What then could have brought Scotland's leader close to tears? This was, of course, a watershed moment when a private burden finally had to be shouldered in public. And, according to one source close to Nicola Sturgeon what was also significant was confirmation from the civil service that it had sufficient confidence in its investigation to refer the complaints to the police. That is said to have shattered the first minister's confidence in the denials Alex Salmond had given her. Having controversially met or spoken to him five times during the investigation - in which she insists she played no part - she broke off contact with him in July. Nicola Sturgeon's long standing alliance with her predecessor was in the process of breaking down and the day of the Daily Record scoop was probably when it became irretrievable. Alex Salmond was effectively at war with the government he once led and therefore with the woman who replaced him - his protÃ©gÃ©, Nicola Sturgeon. There was a lot to cry about. The Salmond/Sturgeon association spans three decades - she had backed him for the party leadership in 1990 and he encouraged her to stand for Westminster two years later, when she was just 21. ""He believed in me long before I believed in myself,"" she once said. Alex Salmond was a mentor, ally and friend. You could trace his influence in her early speaking style and in the way she sometimes scoffed at rivals during debate. 1999 - A fresh-faced SNP line-up in a new Scottish Parliament. The team of opposition MSPs, featuring the 29-year-old Nicola Sturgeon, was led by Alex Salmond 2011 - Alex Salmond was still leader of his party, but now he was running a majority SNP-government with Nicola Sturgeon at his side He appointed her to the SNP front bench when they were both elected to Holyrood in 1999. However, a little over a year into the new parliament Alex Salmond gave up the leadership, passing the reins to John Swinney. When he resigned in 2004 Nicola Sturgeon made her move for the top party job. The then 34-year-old entered the contest, but when it looked like she would lose to rival Roseanna Cunningham Alex Salmond came to the rescue. His decision to make a leadership comeback saved her from defeat. Instead, she became a winner, running as his deputy on what they styled as a joint ticket. This was the beginning of the powerful political partnership that has dominated Scottish politics and made a big impact on the UK political scene in the early part of this century. They led the SNP into government for the first time in 2007, to an overall majority at Holyrood in 2011 and within touching distance of independence in 2014. What is the Salmond and Sturgeon row all about? A brief history of Alex Salmond Profile: Nicola Sturgeon They worked well together. Not least because Alex Salmond tended to let Nicola Sturgeon and other trusted ministers do their jobs without interference. As his deputy, her skills and personality seemed to complement his. Where he revelled in the spotlight, she was more naturally reserved. While he enjoyed painting the big picture, she was content to fill in the detail. They offered each other advice and challenge in private, and presented a united front in public - a discipline upon which the SNP's success was built. That's not to say there were no disagreements. When the NHS faced a budget squeeze after the financial crash, Nicola Sturgeon took a stand. According to one Alex Salmond ally, she ""pushed very hard"" to protect cash spending and won the first minister's support. Had she failed, another source said, she was prepared to resign. Nicola Sturgeon's confidence grew further during the independence campaign. From 2012, she took charge of referendum preparations as the Scottish government's so called ""Yes"" minister. It was during this period that she started coming into her own, establishing an approach that was distinct from his. Contrast, for example, the responses they gave to protests by independence supporters against the BBC. Alex Salmond defended those involved, arguing they must be allowed to express a view. Nicola Sturgeon advised that they spend their time campaigning for a ""Yes"" vote rather than against the BBC. Where he could be strident, she was more pragmatic is how one source close to Alex Salmond put it. 2013 - A year before the independence referendum, Alex Salmond made his party conference leader speech. Nicola Sturgeon was still performing her supporting role While their relationship remained strong throughout the referendum there were points of tension. Nicola Sturgeon was frustrated not to be involved in Alex Salmond's preparation for his first debate with the pro-Union leader Alistair Darling. The head-to-head, hosted by STV, saw Alex Salmond struggle with currency questions. When he set off for China in November 2013 without leaving detailed comments on the latest draft of the independence White Paper, her team questioned his commitment. The first minister's feedback would eventually filter through from the People's Republic. None of this caused a serious rift between them - that would come later, once Alex Salmond had left office. On 18 September 2014the independence vote was lost by 55% to 45%and within two months of that date Alex Salmond was gone as party leader and first minister. As Nicola Sturgeon prepared to take over, she acknowledged Alex Salmond had left ""big boots to fill"". However, she also asserted her political independence. ""I will wear my own shoes"" she said ""and they will have higher heels"". 2014 - Alex Salmond applauds new SNP leader Nicola Sturgeon moments after she had addressed party members. She was now in charge and centre stage She promised a more female friendly-leadership that would give priority to key issues of gender equality and seek to advance the interests of women. That's a pledge that may have weighed heavily as she thought of her response to the #MeToo movement a few years later. The key point about this transfer of power is that it fundamentally changed this political couple's relationship. She was no longer the understudy, she was now the principal performer. The new first minister travelled the country, addressing large audiences in what became known as her ""rock star tour"" and under her leadershipthe SNP won spectacularly at the 2015 Westminster election. By contrast, Alex Salmond's political power was on the wane. He could have pursued a career in business, academia or on the lecture circuit but he could not resist the pull of politics. As part of the 2015 landslide, he returned to Westminster, as MP for Gordon, in search of a new role. The party appointed him international affairs spokesman with a certain licence to stir things up. Friends said it was difficult for him to adjust. According to one MP, he did not take kindly to no longer driving the bus. When Alex Salmond publicly suggested a referendum might not be the only route to independence, the new driver asserted her authority. Nicola Sturgeon made clear that winning a referendum was now the established way to leave the UK. Within a few months of replacing him, Nicola Sturgeon dropped Alex Salmond's policy of a blanket 3p cut to corporation tax in the event of independence. He was not consulted. He was, however, brought into the loop for some decisions, such as the ill-fated call for indyref2 in early 2017. They were still in touch but nothing like as much as when they were partners in power. With one at Westminster and the other at Holyrood, they saw each other less and were gradually drifting apart. 2021 - There have been five first ministers since the Scottish Parliament's inception in 1999. Their portraits hang alongside each other in Bute House - the official residence for those who do Scotland's top job The relationship deteriorated more seriously after the 2017 general election which sawAlex Salmond defeated for the first time in 30 years of parliamentary service. When Nicola Sturgeon phoned to offer her commiserations, she found Alex Salmond unavailable. It was, apparently, two or three weeks before they spoke. Alex Salmond was dealing with the death of his father around that time as well as the loss of his parliamentary seat. But there was something else. A friend of his said he was ""not very impressed"" with the SNP's election campaign, considering it insubstantial and lacking in energy and purpose. The party lost 21 of its 56 seats in this first election after the Brexit referendum and the Scottish Conservatives won 13 - enough to sustain Theresa May in office with help from the DUP. If that was one source of tension in Alex Salmond's relationship with his successor, others soon emerged as he began a new career outside politics. Appearing in his own show at the Edinburgh Fringe, Alex Salmond was accused of sexism when he explained the absence of any high profile female guests with the double entendre that he ""couldn't make them come"". Nicola Sturgeon said he was ""not sexist"" just as she had done two years earlier whenAlex Salmond told Conservative minister, Anna Soubry in the Commons to ""behave yourself woman"". The first minister's defence of her predecessor was more qualified this time. She said he was not always as funny as he thought and that perhaps his joke belonged in the era of Benny Hill. It was apparent to some in the SNP that she was wearying of him. As one MP put it, he was ""seen as a nuisance"" by the leadership during 2017. The lowest point came in November of that year, when it was announced thatAlex Salmond was to host his own show on the Kremlin-backed TV station, RT. Nicola Sturgeon has since spoken of her ""incredulity"" at this decision. It would increase the distance between them. As one Nicola Sturgeon ally put it - ""the first minister cannot take advice from a presenter on Russian state TV"". The week before Alex Salmond's TV show was announced, SNP MSP Mark McDonald was forced to resign as a Holyrood minister over inappropriate behaviour. The Scottish government's wider response to the #MeToo movement, following this departure, would set these political titans on a collision course. There was speculation that if Mr McDonald stood down, Alex Salmond might want to fight the Aberdeen Donside by-election. 2017 - Alex Salmond was on the campaign trail with Joanna Cherry who won a Westminster seat that summer. But he did not win back his According to friends of Alex Salmond that was wrong - he had no interest in making another Holyrood comeback and Nicola Sturgeon's team did not take it seriously either. Even if they found him annoying, they did not appear to regard him as a political threat. They would not however have been unaware that Alex Salmond had helped nurture new talent at Westminster, including the QC turned MP, Joanna Cherry, whom some see as a future leader. What appeared to be of concern to team Sturgeon in November 2017 was an enquiry from Sky News about allegations of sexually inappropriate behaviour by Alex Salmond at Edinburgh Airport. He denied wrongdoing and nothing was broadcast at the time, but according to a later account from Nicola Sturgeon, it raised suspicions about her predecessor's conduct. On the first minister's instruction, the Scottish government was revising its procedures for dealing with complaints of bullying and harassment against ministers, following Mr McDonald's resignation. Nicola Sturgeon specifically told the civil service that the new policy could apply to former ministers and she put that in writing after the Sky News enquiry. This note was sent after her private secretary met a potential complainer against Alex Salmond from within the civil service. The Scottish government insists the first minister did not know about that. Supporters of Alex Salmond suspected the new policy was designed with him in mind, however, the Scottish government rejects that claim. What is clear is that Nicola Sturgeon chose an approach that would not exempt her predecessor. Had she decided otherwise, there might never have been a scandal. Alternatively, one might have blown up in the media anyway and she might have faced criticism for protecting an old friend. Complaints of sexual harassment against Alex Salmond from two female civil servants were lodged and a seven month investigation by the Scottish government followed. Those findings were shelved when the 66-year-oldsuccessfully challenged the complaints handling process in court. It decided the investigation was ""tainted by apparent bias"" and he was awarded more than Â£500,000 in legal costs. But the former first minister faced a much bigger legal battle ahead. In January 2019, Alexander Elliot Anderson Salmond was arrested and charged with a string of sexual offences against women he had worked with at the Scottish government or the SNP, during his term as first minister. When he looked at the names on the charge sheet - according to a Salmond ally - ""that was when it hit him"" that this could be a conspiracy. One of those who testified against him in court has since told the BBC that it is ""utterly absurd"" to suggest nine women would perjure themselves as part of a political plot. Their evidence did not persuade a jury to convict and on 23 March last year - hours before the UK went into coronavirus lockdown - he was acquitted of the 13 sexual assault charges he faced. This video can not be played Alex Salmond is cleared of 13 charges of sexual assault Alex Salmond is now trying to expose what he believes was a conspiracy, accusing Nicola Sturgeon of multiple rule breaches including misleading the Scottish Parliament. She denies his claims. Their toxic feud has destroyed their relationship and caused deep divisions within the SNP. It also threatens damage to the first minister's reputation and to the independence dream she still shares with Alex Salmond. While she seems confident of weathering the storm, her credibility has hardly been enhanced by the revisions she's made to her story along the way. For example, having told Holyrood she learned about the investigation into Alex Salmond directly from him, she now acknowledges that ""allegations of a sexual nature"" were mentioned at a meeting she had days earlier and claims to have forgotten. Exactly what did she know and when, what meetings were held and why, where does party business end and government business begin? These are the questions being picked over by a committee of MSPs at Holyrood. The inescapable point is that Alex Salmond and Nicola Sturgeon cannot both be telling the truth, the whole truth and nothing but the truth as they are obliged to do under oath before the committee. What started three years ago with complaints about the former first minister's behaviour has led to intense scrutiny of Nicola Sturgeon's conduct in handling those complaints. If Alex Salmond can prove his allegations, a clamour for her resignation will follow - ironically at a time when her party and its goal of independence are polling strongly. If his claims are not proven, he is unlikely to give up the fight. Some of his supporters have called for him to be readmitted to the SNP. Others hope that he will stand in this May's Holyrood election for one of the newly formed independence parties. While those who know him well think that unlikely, they note he has not publicly ruled it out. As one MP put it ""you just never know what Alex is going to do next"".

The most crucial Budget for business in a generation,"There has arguably never been a moment in living memory where business and government need each other more than now. Clinging together like the passengers in the front car of a rollercoaster - this Budget is the moment the photo is snapped after the sickening plunge, grimaces fixed for the ride ahead. Business needs the government to go on another massive spending splurge to get us to the other side of lockdown. In many ways, the ""roadmap"" out of lockdown already told us the most important stuff that will be in the Budget. Furlough, the business rates holiday, additional grants and VAT deferrals and cuts for hospitality are all pretty much guaranteed to the end of June, when the government hopes firms will be able to operate with few restrictions. After that, the roles start to reverse. Westminster will need help from businesses to preserve and create millions of jobs. Companies will need incentives to invest, build, hire and train - particularly younger workers who have suffered the most and on whose economic future the success of this moment may be judged for decades. Governments can encourage, but ultimately it is businesses which create. Budget 2021: The challenges facing Rishi Sunak Mortgage guarantee to help buyers with 5% deposit BBC editors on what to expect in the Budget Increased capital allowances, the expansion of youth training programmes and subsidies like the Kickstart Scheme are all expected in a speech behind which the mantra ""jobs, jobs, jobs"" will be almost audible from the Treasury building. The tight embrace between government and business seems a long way since the concerns of business were swatted away with a four-letter ""swish"" by a prime minister who saw them as an irritant in the project of getting Brexit done. The UK is in more debt than it's been in for more than 50 years. At over Â£2 trillion, it is equivalent to 100% of its entire annual income for the first time since the early 1960s, when debt was still on a downward trajectory from spending on World War Two. By far the most powerful weapon against debt is growth: it has a doubly positive effect. It increases the denominator (the bottom number) of the debt to GDP ratio, while reducing the numerator (the top bit) by keeping the bill for benefits like Universal Credit lower. That is why the next twist on this rollercoaster ride is the most perilous. No-one really knows how many of the almost five million workers still on furlough have a job to go back to. More than anything, this Budget is about how many of them can return to, or find new, work. This video can not be played What factors could shape Rishi Sunak's thinking in his 2021 Budget? There will be some eye-catching whizzes and bangs as the government experiments with ideas like freeports, drums up extra funding for start-ups and proposes looser stock market listing rules to grow new firms and attract international investors. But sooner or later - and I suspect the emphasis will be later than recent headlines suggest - the government will need businesses help to pay off some the UK's enormous debts. Corporation tax will rise slowly. But this is perhaps a good example of how little politics figures in this Budget. The chancellor arguably has more to fear from his own backbenches than he does from a Labour party, who find themselves in the unusual position of siding with the very MPs in their opposition on tax rises on businesses - who already enjoy the lowest rates in the G8. But corporation tax is pretty small beer anyway. It contributes less than 8% of all tax collected by the government, compared with the 45% it receives from income tax and National Insurance from individuals who have - you guessed it - jobs, jobs, jobs. The government is also scared that the ""free money"" window may be closing. Ever since the financial crisis, governments have been able to borrow at close to zero rates of interest. There are signs that is changing. A 1% rise in borrowing costs will cost the government five times more than it will get by raising the corporation tax rate by 1%. That is why the government and businesses will need to hold each others' hands on a ride they really are in together. What is the Budget and when will it happen?

Furlough set to be extended - minister,"This video can not be played Kwarteng: Chancellor to extend furlough scheme Business support including furlough and the VAT cut for hospitality firms will continue ""while lockdown persists"", the business secretary has said. With Covid-19 restrictions set to end by June at the earliest, Kwasi Kwarteng told the BBC it was important not to ""crush"" any potential recovery. Ahead of Wednesday's Budget, Rishi Sunak said he would protect jobs using the ""full firepower"" at his disposal. But he also promised honesty about his plans to ""fix"" the public finances. He faces a potential row with some Conservative MPs if he imposes tax increases, amid warnings they could stifle economic growth. And Labour is urging him to abandon planned council tax rises in England. What is the Budget and when will it happen? Five things to look out for in the Budget The most crucial Budget for business in a generation Â£5bn fund to help High Street recover from Covid In his Budget statement, which is due to get under way at around 12.30 GMT on Wednesday, the chancellor will commit the government to doing ""whatever it takes to support the British people and businesses through this moment of crisis"". He is set to extend the Â£20-a-week top up to universal credit for six months to help struggling households, a government source told the BBC. The chancellor spoke to people who have benefitted from government schemes to support employment from the Treasury Other support is expected to include: Â£408m for museums, theatres and galleries in England to help them reopen when Covid restrictions ease Â£150m to help communities take over pubs in danger of closing Â£300m summer sports recovery package, including cash for English cricket He is also expected to set out his plans to tackle the huge hole in the government's balance sheet - caused by the high levels of borrowing and debt built up during the pandemic, and the hit to tax revenues from the closure of many sectors of the economy. ""Once we are on the way to recovery, we will need to begin fixing the public finances - and I want to be honest about our plans to do that,"" he is expected to say. The Budget won't just be about carrying on the emergency support, with a hefty dollop of Brand Sunak, with a TV press conference and sofa chat on Wednesday evening, on top of the traditional red box doorstep and green bench moments. It will also be about how he hopes to return the Tories to their more traditional trademark - being careful with the country's cash. There won't be a return to the kind of political argument over the deficit and the debate that David Cameron and George Osborne dominated in the early part of the last decade. As one Treasury minister said: ""Austerity? You just can't do it now."" Read Laura's full blog The Budget comes at a very difficult time for businesses and government finances. Official figures show the UKeconomy contracted by 9.9%last year and unemploymentrose to 5.1%in the three months to December - the worst rate since 2015. With its takings down and its spending up, the government isexpected to borrow Â£394bnduring the current financial year - the highest figure seen in peacetime. The furlough scheme,currently paying up to 80% of six million people's salaries,is scheduled to stop at the end of April. But the prime minister's ""roadmap"" for easing Covid-19 restrictions says the final legal limits on social contact and business activity will end no earlier than 21 June. This video can not be played What factors could shape Rishi Sunak's thinking in his 2021 Budget? Asked on BBC Breakfast if the job support scheme would continue, Mr Kwarteng said the chancellor had ""already indicated that we will be extending furlough"". And he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think it's a fairly good assumption that, while lockdown persists, there will be additional support."" Mr Kwarteng said there would ""perhaps be an extension"" of the reduced - 5% - rate of VAT for the hospitality sector, also due to end in 31 March. If vaccines continued to be rolled out ""efficiently"" and the roadmap was followed, there was ""every chance that the economy can bounce back"", he argued. ""We can see strong growth at the end of 2021, and that will be the best way to deal with the growing deficit or to try and reduce it,"" Mr Kwarteng said. The chancellor will promise help to save endangered pubs Mr Sunak is reportedly planning to increase corporation tax to as much as 25%, from the current 19%, to reduce pressure on public finances. Some Conservative MPs, including former Brexit Secretary David Davis, say this would impede recovery and are warning they will resist this or any similar moves. But former Conservative leader Lord Haguewrote in the Daily Telegraph,externalthat, after 12 months of heavy public borrowing to pay for furlough and other schemes, ""at least some business and personal taxes"" would have to rise. For Labour, shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said now was ""not the time"" for tax rises, but has signalled the opposition could support an increase in corporation tax in the future. She has said the plannedcouncil tax rise of up to 5%in England in April should not go ahead at a time ""when people are losing jobs"". What is the Budget and when will it happen?

"'Furlough is a lifeline, I hope they extend it'","Events planner Chantelle Spindle has seen her career take some unexpected turns during the coronavirus pandemic. After being furloughed, then made redundant by one company, she landed another job less than a week later with entertainment and event staffing agency RubyLemon. But since the start of February, she has been put on furlough again. ""It is worrying,"" says Chantelle, 26, from Essex. ""But the company are confident about how they're growing right now and building the brand."" Chantelle's latest furlough has come as pressure mounts on Chancellor Rishi Sunak to extend the wage subsidy programme when he delivers his Budget on 3 March. Will the furlough scheme be extended? Â£50bn so far The furlough scheme has slowed down the number of redundancies, but at present, it is due to finish at the end of April. Boris Johnson was this week criticised for not confirming whether it would continue as he unveiled his roadmap out of lockdown - something Labour said left people in limbo. But the prime minister did say ""we will not pull the rug out"". Furlough has cost the Treasury almost Â£50bn so far and Chancellor Rishi Sunak is understandably reluctant to give an open-ended commitment to financing it indefinitely. But the price of not extending it would be a further big rise in unemployment,which has already reached a rate of 5.1%. What are my rights if I am made redundant? Firms planned 800,000 redundancies last year Last week, RubyLemon took a new team photo for the company's relaunched website. ""I was included in it, so that makes me think I'm going back,"" says Chantelle. She works on the entertainment side, with responsibility for hiring musicians and dancers for events, and was working three days a week when her latest furlough began. She says the scheme has been a lifeline. But while she hopes to be back full-time with the company once the pandemic is under control, she worries about the performers. Most of the 1,500 artists who work for RubyLemon across the UK are freelancers, who can't be furloughed and will continue to struggle as they wait for business to restart in June. ""I think once things are eased and go back to normal, everyone will want to party again,"" Chantelle tells the BBC. ""It just depends on whether these musicians or entertainers are in the same industry."" Industry and unions alike are prevailing on Mr Sunak to maintain furlough until at least the end of July, with the CBI, the TUC union and the British Chambers of Commerce all arguing for an extension. Although the number of people still on furlough has fallen considerably from the peak of nearly nine million, those still on the scheme are hoping that it will see them through until the pandemic eases and the economy reopens. But many began on furlough only to be made redundant - and large numbers of them are still looking for work. Alison and her baby Wilf Alison, from West Yorkshire, was furloughed by the hotel group she worked for between March and October. Then it let her go. The 33-year-old, who was due to give birth to her first child in December, was not entitled to any redundancy money. Her employer also resisted paying her statutory maternity leave at first but relented after conciliation service Acas told her she was entitled to it. The money only just keeps the household going when combined with her husband's income  and it will run out in April, so she needs to find a new job by then. ""I started looking for jobs in January, a month after having my baby. You wouldn't normally do that but I know some people have had it worse,"" Alison tells the BBC. She adds: ""I would love to find part-time work and spend more time with my son but I will need to work full time to support the household."" Lockdown brought the hospitality industry to a standstill, and while restrictions on hotels should start to lift in May, things won't be back to normal for some time. Alison is open to roles outside her sector but feels pessimistic given the state of the job market: ""If I don't find anything our finances will be put under a lot of stress."" She wants Mr Sunak to do more support hospitality; she'd also like to see more generous maternity leave and redundancy rules to protect women. As well as supporting existing jobs, Mr Sunak is being urged in this year's Budget to do more for those still trying to enter the job market, particularly young people. There are calls to overhaul the Kickstart programme, which which provides subsidised work placements for young people who have been out of work for at least six months. Since launch in September, fewer than 2,000 work placements having been started due to Covid restrictions, despite 120,000 roles having been created. Mr Sunak has also been urged to offer more support for apprenticeships after uptake fell sharply last year. Oliver Holt, from Blackpool, says he wants to be an apprentice mechanic as working for a garage ""would be a dream"". He secure four months' work experience at a local garage last year, but that came to an end when staff were put on furlough. Since then the 20-year-old, who has already passed his level 2 in mechanics at college, has not managed to find anyone to take him on, despite countless applications. He says the pandemic has made apprenticeships hard to come by, while another issue is that he suffers from mild attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (ADHD) and autism. ""An employer might think that I could be a liability, which isn't the case,"" he told the BBC. ""I'm super-keen and I have a positive approach."" In the meantime, he has washed cars to pay for driving lessons. After a post of his went viral on Facebook, well-wishers boosted his efforts by donating more than Â£300 worth of cleaning products. ""I was fed up of being inside and not doing anything,"" he says. ""It gave me a better work ethic and a better approach."" Since August the government has offered businesses Â£2,000 for each apprentice aged under 25 they take on, and a payment of Â£1,500 for those older than 25. But this is due to end on 31 March, and bodies such as The Construction Leadership Council want Mr Sunak to extend it. The government promised to continue helping people ""to find new jobs, acquire new skills or start new businesses"" as the country comes out of lockdown. It also said it would ""carefully tailor"" the level of job support it gave to individuals ""to reflect the changing circumstances as restrictions ease and the economy is gradually reopened"". It said Mr Sunak would give more details in the Budget on 3 March. What is the Budget and when will it happen?

Circuit-breaker lockdown for Isle of ManThe island will return to a three-week lockdown after a sharp rise in unexplained coronavirus cases.,"Restrictions will come into force at 00:01 GMT on Wednesday A 21-day ""circuit-breaker"" lockdown has been announced to limit the spread of Covid-19 on the Isle of Man, the chief minister has said. The island has seen a rise in cases in recent days, with some stemming froman infected ferry crew member. Howard Quayle said an increase in other - unexplained - cases indicated there was transmission ""that we cannot see and do not understand"". The new restrictions came into force at midnight. Under the new measures, people are required to stay at home unless for exercise or essential travel, avoid mixing with other households and socially distance when outside. Schools are shut to most pupils and non-essential businesses are required to close. And all hospitality and leisure venues have also shut their doors to customers although takeaway and delivery services are still allowed. People are required to stay at home except for exercise or essential travel Edward Cox, who owns the Front Porch bar in Douglas, said the lockdown was the right decision but it was ""absolutely gutting"". He added that he felt the government was not ""prepared enough"" for another outbreak and the island ""should never have got to this position"". The Â£1,500 in government support offered would ""not touch the sides"" and he would be forced to throw out large quantities of fresh food, he added. Unlikethe January lockdown, construction work is allowed to continue provided it is outdoors or in a vacant property. Financial support measures, which were put in place during the island's previous two lockdown periods, have been reactivated. In recent days, the island has seen a small number of confirmed Covid-19 cases where the source is not known, one of them in a school. Bill Shimmins MHK said the government's response to the current cluster of cases was ""akin to a slow-motion train crash"". He added that, had measures been imposed earlier, it would have avoided ""this incredibly damaging lockdown"". More than 40 Covid-19 cases have been linked to the cluster involving the ferry crew member, who tested positive for the virus on 18 February. Officials believed it was largely under control, but five unexplained cases have been identified since Friday. Mr Quayle said there was insufficient data to support measures being taken earlier and the response had to be ""proportionate"". There are currently 52 active cases of Covid-19 on the Isle of Man.

Brazil 'variant of concern' in UK,"A coronavirus ""variant of concern"" first detected in Brazil has now been found in the UK. Three cases have been detected in England and separately three in Scotland. In England, officials are still trying to track down one of those who tested positive for the new variant. The three Scottish residents had flown to north-east Scotland from Brazil via Paris and London, the Scottish government said. Experts believe this variant (P1) - first detected in travellers to Japan from Manaus in northern Brazil in January - could be more contagious. There are also concerns vaccines may not be as effective against it - but NHS England's Prof Stephen Powis said vaccines could be ""rapidly adapted"". Dr Susan Hopkins, from Public Health England (PHE), said the UK was more advanced than many other countries in identifying the variants and mutations and therefore able to act quickly. How worrying is the Brazil coronavirus variant? More than 20m in UK have had first Covid jab In England, the first two cases are from the same household in South Gloucestershire after someone returned from Brazil on 10 February - five days before the government's hotel quarantine rule came into force. Two other people in the same household have also since tested positive for Covid - but tests are still ongoing to check if it is the same variant, so they are not included in the overall UK total of six. PHE said officials are now tracking down passengers who were on the same flight from Sao Paulo to Heathrow, via Zurich. The third case identified in England is not linked to the other two cases and the whereabouts of that person are still not known. PHE said the person did not complete their test registration card so follow-up details are unavailable. Officials are asking anyone who took a test on 12 or 13 February and who has not received a result or has an uncompleted test registration card to come forward immediately by calling 119. Meanwhile, testing is being ramped up in South Gloucestershire - on the outskirts of Bristol - with people living in five postcode areas invited to get tested even if they do not have symptoms. Thepostcodes fall within Bradley Stoke, Patchway and Little Stoke. Regarding the cases in Scotland, the government said the three people had tested positive while self-isolating. Other passengers who were on the same flight from London to Aberdeen are now being contacted. The Brazil variant is something officials are worried about because it shares similar mutations to the South Africa variant of concern. Both have undergone genetic changes that could make them more contagious and perhaps less easy to stop with our current vaccines. The coronavirus jabs being given to people now were designed around earlier versions of the pandemic virus, not these new variants. Scientists believe they should still protect, although perhaps not quite as well. Work is already under way to redesign or tweak the vaccines to make them a better match for some of these new ""variants of concern"". These updated vaccines could be ready within months, meaning the UK would have millions of doses ready to give people a booster shot before next winter to make sure the population is protected. There will be more cases out there of new variants that have not yet been identified. While it may not be possible to eliminate them, the determination is there to slow the spread of coronavirus, including new variants. Sticking to the social distancing rules will help. Both PHE and the Scottish government said the variant had been designated ""of concern"" as it shares some important mutations with the variant first identified in South Africa (known as B.1.351). One of these mutations - called E484K - may help the virus evade parts of the immune system called antibodies. It is also possible that this variant may respond less well to current vaccines, but more work is needed to understand this. In January, a coronavirus variant from Brazilwas found in the UK- but it was not this variant of concern. PHE said the ""risk to the wider community is considered low"" but as a precaution extra community testing is be rolled out in some postcodes north of Bristol. It urged people to keep following the coronavirus measures. Extra testing in the community has already been carried out for other variants elsewhere in the country Meanwhile, Labour's shadow home secretary, Nick Thomas-Symonds, said the news of the variant was ""deeply concerning"". ""It is now vital that we do everything we can to contain it,"" he said. ""But this is further proof that the delay in introducing a hotel quarantine was reckless and the continuing refusal to put in place a comprehensive system leaves us exposed to mutations coming from overseas."" The hotel quarantine rule came into forceon 15 February. It means that travellers coming to England from 33 countries - including Brazil - must pay to quarantine in a hotel for 10 days, while in Scotland the rule applies to travellers from all countries. Before that date, travellers arriving in the UK still needed to self-isolate in their homes for 10 days. All travellers to the UK also need to present a negative Covid test taken a maximum of 72 hours before their departure. Home Affairs Committee chairwoman Yvette Coopersaid on Twitter,externalit was ""notable"" that the pre-flight testsfirst brought in by the government in Januarydid not catch six cases. It comes as the UK announced another 6,035 cases of coronavirus and reported that a further 144 people had died within 28 days of a positive test. But a milestone in the vaccination programme was reached, withmore than 20 million people having receivedtheir first dose of the vaccine. LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area?

Join us for more coverage tomorrow. Here's a recap of some of the latest stories from around the world: The UK government's global travel taskforce has met for the first time to start planning the UK's return to foreign travel. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps held a meeting with government departments, travel firms, transport operators and industry bodies. Boris Johnson announced last month that foreign leisure travel for people in England could be permitted from May 17 at the earliest. This is dependant on various factors related to the coronavirus pandemic, such as vaccine rollouts and the prevalence of Covid-19 variants. The taskforce will give a report to the prime minister on April 12 setting out recommendations for how and when overseas trips could resume.  Shapps says: ""The UK's leading vaccine rollout has created a wave of optimism and, as a result, the global travel taskforce is charged with exploring safe and secure ways to restart international travel when the time is right."" He added: ""We will not only consider the progress of our world-beating domestic vaccine programme, but also need to review where destination countries have got to with both vaccine and testing capabilities."" Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China aims to deliver 560 million doses within four months China has so
far delivered more than 52.5 million Covid-19 vaccinations. If these are single
doses, that means that roughly 3-4% of the countryâs 1.4 billion population have been
inoculated. However, the
country has ambitious plans to rapidly step up its vaccination programme over
the next four months.  Today, Chinaâs top respiratory disease expert Zhong
Nanshan confirmed that Chinaâs centre for disease control and preventionhad plans to administer 40 doses per 100 people by the end of June,external. It was perhaps
to be expected that China had plans to imminently accelerate its domestic
vaccine drive, given that it alreadyhas the capacity to produce at least one billion doses,externaland is increasinglyrolling out vaccine aid overseas - to at least 53 developing countries,external. Chinaâs had
some practice at rolling out medical care to huge populations. It showed last
year that it had the capacity to mass-test entire cities with millions of
residents for Covid-19 within days. In October,it took just five days to test nine million residents across the eastern city of Qingdao. Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Sex workers have gathered outside the Dutch parliament, in protest at not being allowed to return to work when other contact professions can reopen for business on Wednesday. ""Sex work is work"" and ""no stigma"" are among the words written on the banners brandished by women dressed in red. All contact professionals - hairdressers, beauticians, tattoo artists  - can start seeing clients again from 3 March but sex workers can't. This might not strike you as surprising - in many countries these trades are considered entirely different - but here in the Netherlands they usually enjoy equal status.
Prostitution was legalised more than two decades ago. Sex workers pay taxes, the industry is tightly regulated.   But sex work is still considered too risky during the pandemic.
So they have brought their peep show to parliament along with a plea, to be allowed to get back to business. Iraq received 50,000 Sinopharm vaccines donated by China on Monday Iraq has begun its Covid-19 vaccination programme, as the
country struggles to contain a new spike in infections ahead of a historic
visit by Pope Francis. Front-line health workers were among the first people to
be vaccinated on Tuesday, a day after the arrival of 50,000 Sinopharm vaccines
donated by China. The government says it has ordered another two million doses
from Sinopharm to help protect the population of 40 million. It will also
receive at least two million Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines via the global Covax
scheme, while the World Bank has reportedly agreed to fund 1.5 million doses from
Pfizer-BioNTech. Iraq is battling a second wave of its epidemic. It reported
more than 4,600 new cases and 30 deaths on Tuesday, only six weeks after the daily
figures fell to 596 and three respectively. The government has imposed 24-hour curfews on Fridays,
Saturdays and Sundays to combat the surge, but huge crowds are still expected
to turn out to greet Pope Francis this weekend. The Pope, who has been vaccinated, chose Iraq for his
first international trip since the start of the pandemic despite his
predecessor Benedict XVI and others warning of the health and security risks. Marianna SpringDisinformation and social media reporter Twitter has
announced it plans toban users who repeatedly
tweet harmful misinformationabout Covid-19 vaccines. Under the scheme, members will face a lock being placed on their
account and if they accrue ""five strikes"", they face a permanent
ban. Twitter has said it will also start labelling
misleading tweets about the jab. Since the beginning of the pandemic - almost 12 months ago -
conspiracy influencers have grown huge followings on social media by repeatedly
sharing falsehoods about vaccines. I investigated the boom in the following of accounts promoting
anti-vaccine content on Twitter forBBC Panorama-
exposing the harm it had caused to communities across the UK. Vulnerable people I interviewed were scared off the vaccines by
the latest tactics of a committed minority of activists, who use Twitter and
other platforms. Twitter has repeatedly committed to tackling harmful misinformation
- but it will take some time to see whether this updated strike system results
in those repeat offenders having their accounts removed. While many of those influencers sharing vaccine mistruths in the
UK have already been suspended from the site, accounts of those in the US -
central to the disinformation ecosystem that repeatedly distorts stories about
the vaccine - remain live at this time. Forced cremations have prompted anger in minority communities Sri Lanka has chosen a remote island where the country's minority Christian and Muslim communities can bury their dead, following a row about the cremation of Covid victims. The government said Iranathivu island in the Gulf of Mannar northwest of the mainland had been chosen because it was thinly populated. The minorities had previously been forced to cremate their dead in line with the practice of the majority Buddhists, but the government backed down last week in the face of vehement criticism from rights groups. Muslims were angered by the ban, introduced last April, saying there was no scientific basis to claims that burials contaminated the groundwater. Muslims make up nearly 10% of the population. However, the head of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress,Rauff Hakeem, also criticised the latest move, saying it was ""pathetic racism"",external. Read more here One BBC reporter, Juliana
Gragnani, was on a flight arriving to Heathrow around the same time as the other
flight into London from Brazil, which has been the focus of some of Public
Health England's investigations as they try to trace the Brazil variant. She talked abouttravellersâ experiences at the time, here. Now, Juliana tells us how she has
been sent a kit to test for Covid, along with other passengers on her
flight: ""I had to travel last year to Brazil due to urgent family
matters. I quarantined before I returned, took a test, and flew back to the UK,
arriving in Heathrow on February 10th, via Paris. Both flights were packed. I
interviewed a few people who told me they were returning hastily before the
hotel quarantine was put in place. My flight, AF1580, arrived around the same
time as the SÃ£o Paulo-Zurich-London flight, where the case from Gloucestershire
was traced back to. Border control was very busy. Passengers from different
flights, including at least one from Italy, another from India, and both from
Brazil (via Paris and Zurich) were in a queue for three hours with no social
distancing. After quarantining for more than two weeks (just to make
sure), this afternoon I got a call from Test and Trace. Theyâre sending me a Covid kit and said this is being done with all passengers in my flight -
AF1580. They also asked if I had taken a test after arriving in England. Walk-in surge testing at The Mall in Cribbs Causeway after two cases of the Brazil variant were identified in South Gloucestershire There's been lots of discussion around the UK's discovery of six cases of a new coronavirus variant first discovered in Brazil - so here's where we are: Please save the date, says Hannah Ingram-Moore, who is organising a celebration of the life of her father, Captain Sir Tom Moore, on 30 April, which would have been his 101st birthday. At a private funeral over the weekend, she described her father, who raised almost Â£33m for NHS charities by walking laps of his garden,as ""a beacon of light and hope to the world"". Now she's planning an event through the Captain Tom Foundation for people all around the world to ""celebrate his generosity of spirit, the hope and joy he brought to millions and his sense of fun"". In a statement,externalposted on Twitter, she thanked people for their ""continuing support and compassion"" shown to her family over the past few weeks. ""On Saturday we were able to give my father a fitting send-off adhering to his wishes in every way,"" she wrote. ""We played music he loved, spoke words that filled us with joy and the addition of full military honours would have had him bursting with pride.""

Only a quarter of AstraZeneca doses delivered to France have been used Earlier we reported that France had revised its stance on the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine, allowing it for some people over the age of 65. President Emmanuel Macron has also said he would happily receive the jab if offered it. And yet just a month ago Mr Macron said the vaccine was ""almost ineffective"" in the over-65s, while his Europe minister was accusing the UK of taking ""massive risks"" by depending too heavily on it. So what has changed? Have the French now seen the limits of criticising AstraZeneca and come to understand that there can be no such thing as too many vaccines? Or have the UK's accusations of French vaccine nationalism been wide of the mark? As the BBC's Hugh Schofield reports, it's probably a mixture of the two. Artists from 41 countries will
appear live at Eurovision, organisers have told theBBCâs Newscast podcast. The contest's Martin Osterdahl says the performances were considered ""necessary travel"". But delegations will be limited to 20 people, down from an average of 38 in normal times, he says. He hopes there will be a live audience - but the decision has not been made yet. ""It makes a huge difference to the atmosphere of the broadcast if we have
some people present,"" he says. But if artists get âdouze pointsâ,
theyâll need to reconsider the usual exuberant celebrations. âWe want to avoid that people
start hugging and kissing each other in spouts of happiness,â says Osterdahl. Commentators like the BBCâs
Graham Norton will broadcast from ventilated commentary booths. âI certainly hope [Norton] will be
able to come,"" says Osterdahl. ""I did have the pleasure of running into him in Stockholm when I
produced the show and heâs always a very welcome visitor to the contest.â Reality Check This video can not be played Coronavirus: False vaccine claims debunked As coronavirus vaccines are distributed across the world, misleading claims about them are also spreading.

Secondary school pupils will take a Covid test before returning to the classroom on 8 March. Children of key workers have been at school since January so they've been key in helping schools prepare for mass testing. They've been showing our social affairs correspondent Fiona Lamdin how it's done. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm It looks like weâre
heading towards a third wave, is the message Swedenâs top state epidemiologist
Anders Tegnell delivered at the Swedish public health agencyâs latest news
conference. The agencyâs data suggest that the number of people being
hospitalised with Covid-19 is on the rise and there are concerns about the pace
at which the UK variant of Covid-19 is spreading. Sweden has never had a lockdown but has toughened its approach in recent
months, for example closing bars and restaurants early, and limiting organised
public gatherings to a maximum of eight people. Now, Tegnell has proposed that
from 6 March a maximum of 500 people should be allowed inside shopping malls
and large stores, a move that is expected to be approved by the government. There are already rules in place that require stores to ensure at least 10
square metres of space per customer, but there have been concerns
about overcrowding in shopping centres during recent school holidays. As we've been mentioning today, Chancellor Rishi Sunak will deliver the Budget tomorrow. Ahead of the speech, Sunak has promised:  So, what else you should be looking out for? We break downwhat might be included here, including more support for jobs and workers, a stamp duty holiday extension, and the question of whether the chancellor will extend the business rates holiday. And here iswhat we know already. Former prime minister David Cameron has received a Covid vaccination. He shared a photo of himself getting the jabon Twitter,externaland urged others to do the same. ""It's crucial we look after ourselves and each other,"" he wrote. Surge testing at The Mall in Cribbs Causeway, one of two sites in South Gloucestershire The search for an individual in the UK infected with the Brazil variant hasnarrowed to 379 households in south-east England, says the health secretary. It is one of six cases of the P.1 variant found in the UK in February. But what do we know about the other five cases?  There are concerns that the variant first identified in Brazil could spread more easily and vaccines have not yet been tested on it.Read more about it here. A man has claimed he was strip-searched in police custody after officers arrested him on suspicion of breaching Covid rules with a trip to the beach. On Sunday, Radek Kotlarek, 39, from Rhos-on-Sea, Conwy, drove more than 20 miles to the beauty spot of Talacre in Flintshire, with his wife and teenage son. He said it was for a ""mental break"" as the couple were concerned their son was struggling in lockdown and affected by the separation from sick family members in Poland. North Wales Police said officers arrested Mr Kotlarek after he refused to give his name when they suspected he had breached regulations. He was released without charge and has not been given a fixed penalty notice. Allegations that Mr Kotlarek was strip-searched while in custody were put to the force, but it did not respond. Wales' lockdown rules state all exercise must start from home and travel must only be for essential reasons. Read thefull story here. Â© 2025 BBC.

"BBC Three will return to TV screens after six yearsThe channel will make a comeback, after scoring hits with Normal People and Fleabag online.","BBC Three is set to return as a TV channel BBC Three will return as a fully-fledged TV channel in January 2022, six years after it moved online. The channel has since been responsible for major hits including Fleabag, Normal People and Killing Eve - prompting calls for its resurrection. Last year, BBC research concluded there was a ""strong case"" for it to come back as a regular TV channel, focusing on younger audiences. MP Julian Knight said the move showed the BBC had ""failed"" those viewers. ""I question whether putting the clock back five years is the right way to win over 18-35s,"" said Mr Knight, who chairs the select committee for the department for digital, culture, media and sport (DCMS). ""The BBC needs to back success and make sure its programmes reach as many young people as possible wherever they live in the UK,"" said the BBC's chief content officer, Charlotte Moore. ""So regardless of the debates about the past, we want to give BBC Three its own broadcast channel again."" As announced in the BBC's Annual Plan last year, the channel's budget will also be doubled over the next two years - a decision that was also criticised by Mr Knight, who accused the BBC of putting extra investment into programmes while ""those over 75 are being chased to pay up for their TV licences"". The BBC ended the provision of free TV licences for most over-75s last year, after the government decided to stop paying for the benefit. RuPaul's Drag Race UK, currently in its second season, has proved a runaway success When it returns, BBC Three will be targeted at audiences aged 16-34, broadcasting from 19:00 to 04:00 each day. As a result, CBBC's broadcast hours will revert to closing at 19:00 - as was the case before 2016. It currently runs until 21:00. The move will still need approval from media regulator Ofcom before it can go ahead. Seven years ago the BBC announced that BBC Three would become digital only. The main reason given was the need to save money. The public narrative was: Young audiences congregate online rather than watch linear TV, so there's no point providing a linear service. Since then, three things have happened. The flight of young audiences to digital platforms, and away from scheduled TV, has accelerated. BBC Three has produced a big range of huge, global hits. And the pressure on the BBC, not least from Ofcom, to prove that it still appeals to young people has grown sharply. This last point is critical. The BBC commissioned research showing that there is still a market of young people - albeit smaller than years ago - on linear platforms. Given the success of the shows commissioned by BBC Three, the feeling at the top of the organisation was that putting them back on a linear platform would create upside in terms of audience numbers, for relatively low cost. Despite the need for more savings today, that cost can be justified because when the BBC negotiates with the government over the future of the licence fee, it needs the strongest possible argument on its relevance and universal appeal. BBC Three was originally taken off air in March 2016. The corporation said the move would save Â£30m a year, helping it to reduce its spending after cuts imposed by the government in 2010. Much of the budget was reallocated to fund drama on BBC One, while BBC Three was expected to target younger audiences online. But the plans caused controversy, prompting the Save BBC Three campaign which saw more than 300,000 people sign a petition to keep it on air. Journalist and founder of the campaign Jono Read said the channel's return was ""great news"". ""It became clear that the decision to to take it off air was a counter-productive move that bosses had taken to sacrifice the station under the guise of budget cuts, and one that was deeply unpopular with its audience. ""Nonetheless the online move has shown real potential for BBC Three and I think it will thrive when it is once again given the chance to combine traditional and new media when it returns to TV in 2022"", he says. Many of BBC Three's commissions have ended up on linear TV, with shows like Killing Eve and Fleabag attracting huge audiences on BBC One. Paul Mescal and Daisy Edgar-Jones in BBC Three's Normal People Normal People, about the tangled love lives of two Irish teenagers, also became the breakout hit of the first lockdown. It was requested on the BBC iPlayer 62.7 million times last year, more than any other programme. Other hit shows on the channel include Man Like Mobeen, This Country, Ru Paul's Drag Race UK and the Jesy Nelson documentary Odd One Out. In its online incarnation, BBC Three has won a raft of awards, including RTS Channel of the Year in 2017 and Digital Channel of the Year 2019 at the Edinburgh TV Festival.

"Reggae legend Bunny Wailer dies, aged 73The musician was a founding member of The Wailers, who found international fame with Bob Marley.","Bunny Wailer won three Grammys One of reggae's most important voices, Bunny Wailer, has died at the age of 73. The musician, from Kingston, Jamaica, was a founding member of The Wailers alongside his childhood friend, Bob Marley. Together, they achieved international fame with reggae classics like Simmer Down and Stir It Up, before Wailer left to go solo in 1974. He went on to win three Grammys and was given Jamaica's Order Of Merit in 2017. His death was confirmed by manager Maxine Stowe, and Jamaica's Culture Minister, Olivia Grange. The cause of death is unknown, but he had been in hospital since having a stroke in July 2020. Tributes have already poured in for the musician, with fans and fellow musicians describing him as a legend. ""This is one of the lowest moment in the history of our culture,"" wrote dancehall artist Shaggy on Facebook. ""You have made us proud king. Rest well."" ""Oh man, god bless Bunny Wailer,""wrote Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist, Flea,external.  ""What a true rocker and noble man. I love him."" Andrew Holness, Jamaica's prime minister, also paid tribute, calling his death ""a great loss for Jamaica and for reggae"". The original incarnation of The Wailers, circa 1964 (L-R): Bunny Wailer, Bob Marley and Peter Tosh The star, whose real name was Neville O'Riley Livingston, had been the last surviving member of The Wailers, following Bob Marley's death from cancer in 1981, and Peter Tosh's murder during a robbery in 1987. Born on 20 April 10, 1947, Livingston spent his earliest years in the village of Nine Mile, where he was raised by his father, Thaddeus, who ran a grocery store. That was where he first met Marley, and the toddlers soon became firm friends, making their first music together at Stepney Primary and Junior High School. Following the death of Marley's father in 1955, his mother, Cedella, moved in with Livingston's father. The boys were essentially raised as step-brothers, especially after Cedella and Thaddeus had a daughter together, Pearl. After moving to Trenchtown in Kingston, they met Peter Tosh and formed a vocal group called The Wailing Wailers - because, Marley said: ""We started out crying."" The area was poor and afflicted by violence. Livingston later remembered building his first guitar from ""a bamboo staff, the fine wires from an electric cable and a large sardine can"". But singer Joe Higgs, aka ""the Godfather of Reggae"", lived nearby and took the boys under his wing. Under his tutelage, they refined their sound, adding vocalist Junior Braithwaite and backing singers Beverly Kelso and Cherry Green before shortening their name to The Wailers. In December 1963, the band entered Coxsone Dodd's infamous Studio One to record Simmer Down, a song Marley had written calling for peace in the ghettos of Kingston. Faster and harder than the music The Wailers later became known for, the song was an immediate hit, reaching number one in Jamaica. They followed it up with the original version of Duppy Conqueror, before releasing their debut album The Wailing Wailers, in 1965. Allow YouTube content?

Soon after, the band went on hiatus as Marley got married and moved to the USA, and Livingston served a year in jail for marijuana possession. But they still managed to release 28 singles between 1966 and 1970, before releasing their second album, Soul Rebels. Their international breakthrough came three years later with Catch A Fire - the first record they made for Chris Blackwell's Island Records. The collaboration came about almost by accident. The Wailers had been touring the UK with Johnny Nash - who'd had a hit with a cover of Stir It Up - but found themselves unable to pay for their trip home. Blackwell offered to sign the band to Island, paying them an advance to cover their air fares and cost of recording an album in Jamaica. Much to the band's displeasure, some of the songs were overdubbed to make them more palatable to an international audience. ""I felt the way to break the Wailers was as a black rock act; I wanted some rock elements in there,"" Blackwell later told Rolling Stone. ""Bunny and Peter didn't want to leave Jamaica, so Bob came to England when we did the overdubs."" The album was not a major seller and failed to chart in both the US and UK - but it has become widely recognised as a classic. Rolling Stone magazine recently placed it at number 140 in its list of the500 greatest albums of all time,external, writing ""the Wailers' ghetto rage comes across uncut"" in  songs like Concrete Jungle and Slave Driver.

Commercial success followed with 1973's Burnin', which featured classic cuts like I Shot The Sheriff, Small Axe and Get Up, Stand Up. However, it was to be the Wailers last album to feature the original Wailers line-up. Tensions already present were exacerbated by Island marketing their albums under the name Bob Marley and The Wailers, and a touring schedule that kept Livingston away from his family. He eventually left in 1973, saying the touring lifestyle clashed with his Rastafarian beliefs - citing the pressure to eat processed foods and play ""freak clubs"". He later said fame was the enemy of creativity. ""Music is based on inspiration and if you're in an environment where you are up and down, here and there, that's how your music is going to sound,"" Livingston told The Los Angeles Times in 1986. ""People get taken away in getting themselves to be a star and that is a different thing from getting yourself to be a good writer, musician, producer and arranger."" The star was known as an elder statesman of reggae Free from the band, he began to work on his solo album Blackheart Man, which included classic songs like Dreamland and Fighting Against Conviction, which was inspired by his stint in prison. He went on to release several acclaimed albums, including 1981's Rock 'n' Groove and 1980s's Bunny Wailer Sings The Wailers, which saw him revisit some of the band's classic material. In the 1990s, he won the Grammy award for best reggae album three times - with each of those records extending and preserving the legacy of Marley and the Wailers:  1991's Time Will Tell: A Tribute to Bob Marley, 1995's Crucial! Roots Classics, and the 1997's all-star Hall of Fame: A Tribute to Bob Marley's 50th Anniversary. ""I'm satisfied with knowing that I'm serving the purpose of getting reggae music to be where it's at,""he told the Washington Post in 2006,external. ""I'm proud to be part of that.""

Unions fear over thousands of steel jobs,"Sanjeev Gupta, who has been called the ""saviour of steel"" Union sources have told the BBC that they are very concerned about the potential risk to thousands of UK steel and engineering jobs. Their fears follow the emergence of financial problems for the owner of plants at Rotherham, Stocksbridge, Newport and Hartlepool. Called the ""saviour of steel"", Sanjeev Gupta's Liberty Group bought up the struggling UK steel businesses. His GFG Alliance company said it had ""adequate funding"". There are 3,000 direct steel employees and a further 2,000 in engineering businesses within the group. One of Mr Gupta's primary sources of finance is a group called Greensill Capital, run by former investment banker Les Greensill who counts former Prime Minister David Cameron among his paid advisers. Greensill's exposure to Mr Gupta's business prompted the Swiss investment bank Credit Suisse to freeze withdrawals from up to Â£10bn worth of funds held as security. Sources close to the situation told the BBC that Greensill was in serious financial trouble and that it would ""not be wrong to surmise that it was likely to go into administration"". The sources added that there was a direct link between Mr Gupta's financing difficulties and risks to thousands of industrial jobs in the UK. A spokesperson for steel union, Community, said: ""There's no doubt these reports are concerning and, on behalf of our members, we are pressing the company for answers. Liberty Steel UK is a crucial strategic business and we are ready to work with the company and the government to secure the business and protect jobs."" Mr Gupta was hailed as saving thousands of UK jobs when he stepped in to buy up plants and processing facilities that seemed on the brink of going bust. But his financial arrangements have always been shrouded in secrecy and controversy. Connections between Greensill Capital and international money manager GAM saw a senior manager at GAM forced to resign over allegations of poor risk management and due diligence over billions in loans to Mr Gupta's empire. GFG Alliance is a collection of global businesses and investments owned by Sanjeev Gupta and his family. A spokesman said: ""GFG Alliance has adequate funding for its current needs and its refinancing plans to broaden its capital base and obtain longer term funding are progressing well. ""Our global efficiency drive means that our core businesses are operationally strong.  We are benefiting from a recovery in steel and aluminium markets which means that most of our businesses are running at near full capacity to meet high demand and are generating positive cash flows."" Harish Patel from Unite told the BBC what many in the industry have feared for some time: ""Unite has always been concerned about the financial basis that Liberty Steel is based on. ""The latest concerns about the future of Greensill and Sunjav Gupta's refinancing difficulties are deeply alarming and  Unite will be seeking urgent reassurances about the health of the business units in the UK.""

Four deny damage to toppled slave trader statue,"The statue was thrown into Bristol Harbour after being pulled down and rolled through the city's streets in June Four people have denied causing criminal damage to a statue of slave trader Edward Colston and will face trial in December. The bronze figure of the slave merchant was pulled down during a Black Lives Matter protest and thrown into Bristol Harbour on 7 June. Jake Skuse, 36, Rhian Graham, 29, Milo Ponsford, 25, and Sage Willoughby, 21, appeared at Bristol Crown Court. They were bailed and a trial is due to start on 13 December. Mr Skuse, of Farley Close, Bristol; Ms Graham, of Colston Road, Bristol; Mr Ponsford, of Bishopstoke, Hampshire; and Mr Willoughby, of Gloucester Road, Bristol, were charged with causing criminal damage in December. A hearing will take place on 8 November for administrative purposes. From left to right: Mr Skuse, Ms Graham, Mr Ponsford and Mr Willoughby's trial is set to start on 13 December After being pulled down during the June rally, the statue was dumped in Bristol Harbour and recovered by Bristol City Council on 11 June. The council said the statue, worth Â£3,750,would be preservedand placed in a museum, along with placards from Black Lives Matter protests. Colston made his fortune in the slave trade and bequeathed his money to charities in Bristol, which led to many venues, streets and landmarks bearing his name. The Colston Hall music venue was formallyrenamed the Bristol Beaconin September. Some venues bearing Colston's name have been changed Ahead of the hearing, London-based law firm Hodge Jones & Allen, which is representing three of the four defendants, said it would fight the charges ""vigorously"". ""We are committed to defending them and their right to a fair trial in this important case. We ask that their privacy is respected,"" a statement said.

Football academy player 'endured living hell',"This video can not be played Lewis Reed says he wants better support for young players A footballer endured a ""living hell"" at a football academy he joined aged 16 that left him suicidal, he revealed. Lewis Reed, from Swansea, wants better support for young players after his experiences at Ipswich Town FC. Now aged 19, the Covid pandemic led to Mr Reed's contract not being renewed, but his time away from the game has given him ""the confidence"" to speak up. Ipswich Town said it was ""disappointed"" to hear of his concerns and was seeking a meeting with Mr Reed to discuss them. The Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) has said it was ""saddened to read Lewis Reed's account of his experience within football and applaud him for speaking out so candidly"". Midfielder Mr Reed said he went from ""such a high"" to ""feeling so low"" at the club, in a matter of months. He told the BBC it hit his parents ""really hard"" especially, because they had been used to seeing their son every day as someone who was ""absolutely loving life as everything was going his way"". ""[But then they had gone to] not seeing him and in that time of not seeing him for his life to become a living hell. Lewis Reed joined Ipswich Town's academy at the age of 16 ""[My mum would] come off the phone and say to my dad that would be the last time she'd speak to her sonâ¦ they were concerned suicide might have been on my mind, and at times it was."" Mr Reed described feeling ""invisible"" to coaching staff and disappointed that he ""didn't get the opportunity to play"" more frequently at the club. And after struggling with ""extreme pain"" from an in-growing toenail, Mr Reed said he was told to ""man-up"". ""Every time my parents rang they thought it might be the last time they would speak to me,"" he said. His family decided to approach the club for help and Mr Reed later attended a counselling session. But he declined the offer of more as he didn't feel like it had helped. ""I actually got more support from the security guard on the gate,"" Mr Reed continued. ""Me and him would have a chat for 30-40 minutes and I felt he was more supportive than some of the coaches at the club."" PFA sees 'spike' in players seeking help FC Not Alone - the mental health football club Prince William on lockdown, football and mental health When his contract was not renewed last year, he said he received no communication from the club. ""We are 16, 17, 18 out of school straight into a tough environment, it's all we've known, football, football and more football, there's no guidance on what the next step is going to be,"" he said. The PFA said it had contacted Mr Reed to offer him support. ""We know that a career in football can be challenging for all players and their families, but particularly young players,"" it said in a statement. ""Over the past decade, the players' union has led the way in putting mental health firmly on football's agenda, providing 24/7 wellbeing support and encouraging personal development."" Mr Reed, who is now interning at his family's business, is calling for a change in the academy system with more support for young players away from home, and on release from contract. In a statement, Ipswich Town said they were ""obviously very disappointed"" to hear of Mr Reed's comments and were currently arranging a meeting with him. ""Our Academy is very highly regarded and we have been assured by all the authorities including the PFA that we have met and exceeded all the protocols around player welfare,"" the club said. ""We will be issuing a much broader statement in due course but if there are any lessons to be learnt from speaking to Lewis, we want to take them on board.""

PFA sees 'spike' in players seeking help,"The Duke of Cambridge helped launch the Football Association's Heads Up mental health campaign in February There has been a ""spike"" in the number of footballers in England seeking mental health support since the start of the coronavirus lockdown. In the first quarter of this year, the Professional Footballers' Association said 299 players had accessed support, compared to 653 in the whole of 2019. PFA director of player welfare Michael Bennett said he is ""worried"" now the situation has ""hit home"" for players. Some have financial worries, while there are also concerns over gambling. ""When you're used to a particular structure and you're not able to follow that, and you're stuck in day in, day out - I'm concerned about players emotionally and mentally,"" Bennett told BBC Sport. ""It's key for them to understand that when something doesn't seem right that they seek the relevant support. ""We had an idea that the first week or two would be a bit of a honeymoon period, where people would be at home and spending time with the family. ""But we always thought the longer it went on that's when it would hit home."" Elite football in England - the Premier League and three divisions that make up the English Football League - is currently suspended indefinitely, having first been paused on 13 March. The Premier League and EFL both hope to play the current season to a conclusion, but how or when that might happen remains uncertain. Royals say lockdown stressful on mental health Celtic striker Griffiths offers mental health support Earlier this week, the EFL and PFA proposed that clubs in League One and League Twodefer up to 25% of players' wages. After an initial ""trickle"" of players approaching the PFA to talk about financial problems, Bennett said more and more were now coming forward to seek help. ""As soon as we put that proposal forward we made sure players were aware they could access support via our benevolent funds if they had any kind of financial hardship,"" he said. ""In the first week or so we even had a number of players calling up because they'd been caught up in the panic buying, overspent money they didn't really have and then had to struggle through."" Bennett added that ""with the boredom factor now kicking in"" he was concerned about an increase in gambling among players too. The leading UK charity for problem gamblers has saidaddicts may be at greater riskduring the current pandemic but that it was ""too early"" to tell if it was on the rise. The PFA has seen a year-on-year increase in the number of members making use of Sporting Chance Clinic's network of therapists and confidential helpline. The 653 players seeking help in 2019 was up from 438 in 2018 - and if the rest of 2020 follows the same pattern as the first three months of the year nearly 1,200 would end up using their services. With social distance measures in place, the PFA has been putting sessions for players on Skype and Zoom to ensure they still have access to whatever support they need. ""We've also put a questionnaire out to all of our members asking about their mental health and how they've been coping over the last two weeks and whether they want or need support,"" added Bennett, a former Charlton Athletic and Brentford winger. ""We're getting a trickle of responses to that now so we'll continue to monitor the data and put in any additional support as and when it's needed.""

Join us for more coverage tomorrow. Here's a recap of some of the latest stories from around the world: The UK government's global travel taskforce has met for the first time to start planning the UK's return to foreign travel. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps held a meeting with government departments, travel firms, transport operators and industry bodies. Boris Johnson announced last month that foreign leisure travel for people in England could be permitted from May 17 at the earliest. This is dependant on various factors related to the coronavirus pandemic, such as vaccine rollouts and the prevalence of Covid-19 variants. The taskforce will give a report to the prime minister on April 12 setting out recommendations for how and when overseas trips could resume.  Shapps says: ""The UK's leading vaccine rollout has created a wave of optimism and, as a result, the global travel taskforce is charged with exploring safe and secure ways to restart international travel when the time is right."" He added: ""We will not only consider the progress of our world-beating domestic vaccine programme, but also need to review where destination countries have got to with both vaccine and testing capabilities."" Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China aims to deliver 560 million doses within four months China has so
far delivered more than 52.5 million Covid-19 vaccinations. If these are single
doses, that means that roughly 3-4% of the countryâs 1.4 billion population have been
inoculated. However, the
country has ambitious plans to rapidly step up its vaccination programme over
the next four months.  Today, Chinaâs top respiratory disease expert Zhong
Nanshan confirmed that Chinaâs centre for disease control and preventionhad plans to administer 40 doses per 100 people by the end of June,external. It was perhaps
to be expected that China had plans to imminently accelerate its domestic
vaccine drive, given that it alreadyhas the capacity to produce at least one billion doses,externaland is increasinglyrolling out vaccine aid overseas - to at least 53 developing countries,external. Chinaâs had
some practice at rolling out medical care to huge populations. It showed last
year that it had the capacity to mass-test entire cities with millions of
residents for Covid-19 within days. In October,it took just five days to test nine million residents across the eastern city of Qingdao. Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Sex workers have gathered outside the Dutch parliament, in protest at not being allowed to return to work when other contact professions can reopen for business on Wednesday. ""Sex work is work"" and ""no stigma"" are among the words written on the banners brandished by women dressed in red. All contact professionals - hairdressers, beauticians, tattoo artists  - can start seeing clients again from 3 March but sex workers can't. This might not strike you as surprising - in many countries these trades are considered entirely different - but here in the Netherlands they usually enjoy equal status.
Prostitution was legalised more than two decades ago. Sex workers pay taxes, the industry is tightly regulated.   But sex work is still considered too risky during the pandemic.
So they have brought their peep show to parliament along with a plea, to be allowed to get back to business. Iraq received 50,000 Sinopharm vaccines donated by China on Monday Iraq has begun its Covid-19 vaccination programme, as the
country struggles to contain a new spike in infections ahead of a historic
visit by Pope Francis. Front-line health workers were among the first people to
be vaccinated on Tuesday, a day after the arrival of 50,000 Sinopharm vaccines
donated by China. The government says it has ordered another two million doses
from Sinopharm to help protect the population of 40 million. It will also
receive at least two million Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines via the global Covax
scheme, while the World Bank has reportedly agreed to fund 1.5 million doses from
Pfizer-BioNTech. Iraq is battling a second wave of its epidemic. It reported
more than 4,600 new cases and 30 deaths on Tuesday, only six weeks after the daily
figures fell to 596 and three respectively. The government has imposed 24-hour curfews on Fridays,
Saturdays and Sundays to combat the surge, but huge crowds are still expected
to turn out to greet Pope Francis this weekend. The Pope, who has been vaccinated, chose Iraq for his
first international trip since the start of the pandemic despite his
predecessor Benedict XVI and others warning of the health and security risks. Marianna SpringDisinformation and social media reporter Twitter has
announced it plans toban users who repeatedly
tweet harmful misinformationabout Covid-19 vaccines. Under the scheme, members will face a lock being placed on their
account and if they accrue ""five strikes"", they face a permanent
ban. Twitter has said it will also start labelling
misleading tweets about the jab. Since the beginning of the pandemic - almost 12 months ago -
conspiracy influencers have grown huge followings on social media by repeatedly
sharing falsehoods about vaccines. I investigated the boom in the following of accounts promoting
anti-vaccine content on Twitter forBBC Panorama-
exposing the harm it had caused to communities across the UK. Vulnerable people I interviewed were scared off the vaccines by
the latest tactics of a committed minority of activists, who use Twitter and
other platforms. Twitter has repeatedly committed to tackling harmful misinformation
- but it will take some time to see whether this updated strike system results
in those repeat offenders having their accounts removed. While many of those influencers sharing vaccine mistruths in the
UK have already been suspended from the site, accounts of those in the US -
central to the disinformation ecosystem that repeatedly distorts stories about
the vaccine - remain live at this time. Forced cremations have prompted anger in minority communities Sri Lanka has chosen a remote island where the country's minority Christian and Muslim communities can bury their dead, following a row about the cremation of Covid victims. The government said Iranathivu island in the Gulf of Mannar northwest of the mainland had been chosen because it was thinly populated. The minorities had previously been forced to cremate their dead in line with the practice of the majority Buddhists, but the government backed down last week in the face of vehement criticism from rights groups. Muslims were angered by the ban, introduced last April, saying there was no scientific basis to claims that burials contaminated the groundwater. Muslims make up nearly 10% of the population. However, the head of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress,Rauff Hakeem, also criticised the latest move, saying it was ""pathetic racism"",external. Read more here One BBC reporter, Juliana
Gragnani, was on a flight arriving to Heathrow around the same time as the other
flight into London from Brazil, which has been the focus of some of Public
Health England's investigations as they try to trace the Brazil variant. She talked abouttravellersâ experiences at the time, here. Now, Juliana tells us how she has
been sent a kit to test for Covid, along with other passengers on her
flight: ""I had to travel last year to Brazil due to urgent family
matters. I quarantined before I returned, took a test, and flew back to the UK,
arriving in Heathrow on February 10th, via Paris. Both flights were packed. I
interviewed a few people who told me they were returning hastily before the
hotel quarantine was put in place. My flight, AF1580, arrived around the same
time as the SÃ£o Paulo-Zurich-London flight, where the case from Gloucestershire
was traced back to. Border control was very busy. Passengers from different
flights, including at least one from Italy, another from India, and both from
Brazil (via Paris and Zurich) were in a queue for three hours with no social
distancing. After quarantining for more than two weeks (just to make
sure), this afternoon I got a call from Test and Trace. Theyâre sending me a Covid kit and said this is being done with all passengers in my flight -
AF1580. They also asked if I had taken a test after arriving in England. Walk-in surge testing at The Mall in Cribbs Causeway after two cases of the Brazil variant were identified in South Gloucestershire There's been lots of discussion around the UK's discovery of six cases of a new coronavirus variant first discovered in Brazil - so here's where we are: Please save the date, says Hannah Ingram-Moore, who is organising a celebration of the life of her father, Captain Sir Tom Moore, on 30 April, which would have been his 101st birthday. At a private funeral over the weekend, she described her father, who raised almost Â£33m for NHS charities by walking laps of his garden,as ""a beacon of light and hope to the world"". Now she's planning an event through the Captain Tom Foundation for people all around the world to ""celebrate his generosity of spirit, the hope and joy he brought to millions and his sense of fun"". In a statement,externalposted on Twitter, she thanked people for their ""continuing support and compassion"" shown to her family over the past few weeks. ""On Saturday we were able to give my father a fitting send-off adhering to his wishes in every way,"" she wrote. ""We played music he loved, spoke words that filled us with joy and the addition of full military honours would have had him bursting with pride.""

Only a quarter of AstraZeneca doses delivered to France have been used Earlier we reported that France had revised its stance on the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine, allowing it for some people over the age of 65. President Emmanuel Macron has also said he would happily receive the jab if offered it. And yet just a month ago Mr Macron said the vaccine was ""almost ineffective"" in the over-65s, while his Europe minister was accusing the UK of taking ""massive risks"" by depending too heavily on it. So what has changed? Have the French now seen the limits of criticising AstraZeneca and come to understand that there can be no such thing as too many vaccines? Or have the UK's accusations of French vaccine nationalism been wide of the mark? As the BBC's Hugh Schofield reports, it's probably a mixture of the two. Artists from 41 countries will
appear live at Eurovision, organisers have told theBBCâs Newscast podcast. The contest's Martin Osterdahl says the performances were considered ""necessary travel"". But delegations will be limited to 20 people, down from an average of 38 in normal times, he says. He hopes there will be a live audience - but the decision has not been made yet. ""It makes a huge difference to the atmosphere of the broadcast if we have
some people present,"" he says. But if artists get âdouze pointsâ,
theyâll need to reconsider the usual exuberant celebrations. âWe want to avoid that people
start hugging and kissing each other in spouts of happiness,â says Osterdahl. Commentators like the BBCâs
Graham Norton will broadcast from ventilated commentary booths. âI certainly hope [Norton] will be
able to come,"" says Osterdahl. ""I did have the pleasure of running into him in Stockholm when I
produced the show and heâs always a very welcome visitor to the contest.â Reality Check This video can not be played Coronavirus: False vaccine claims debunked As coronavirus vaccines are distributed across the world, misleading claims about them are also spreading. There are concerns that false information shared online is fuelling hesitancy among some people about taking the vaccine. BBC Reality Check's Jack Goodman looks at five viral claims and explains why they're wrong. This video can not be played What does Covid testing in schools look like? Secondary school pupils will take a Covid test before returning to the classroom on 8 March. Children of key workers have been at school since January so they've been key in helping schools prepare for mass testing. They've been showing our social affairs correspondent Fiona Lamdin how it's done. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm It looks like weâre
heading towards a third wave, is the message Swedenâs top state epidemiologist
Anders Tegnell delivered at the Swedish public health agencyâs latest news
conference. The agencyâs data suggest that the number of people being
hospitalised with Covid-19 is on the rise and there are concerns about the pace
at which the UK variant of Covid-19 is spreading. Sweden has never had a lockdown but has toughened its approach in recent
months, for example closing bars and restaurants early, and limiting organised
public gatherings to a maximum of eight people. Now, Tegnell has proposed that
from 6 March a maximum of 500 people should be allowed inside shopping malls
and large stores, a move that is expected to be approved by the government. There are already rules in place that require stores to ensure at least 10
square metres of space per customer, but there have been concerns
about overcrowding in shopping centres during recent school holidays. As we've been mentioning today, Chancellor Rishi Sunak will deliver the Budget tomorrow. Ahead of the speech, Sunak has promised:  So, what else you should be looking out for? We break downwhat might be included here, including more support for jobs and workers, a stamp duty holiday extension, and the question of whether the chancellor will extend the business rates holiday. And here iswhat we know already. Former prime minister David Cameron has received a Covid vaccination. He shared a photo of himself getting the jabon Twitter,externaland urged others to do the same.

Â£1.1bn extra spending in new Welsh budget plans,"The Welsh Government will have just over Â£17bn to spend in the next financial year Welsh ministers have confirmed plans to spend an extra Â£1.1bn in the next financial year. The final budget for 2021-22,externalincludes an extra Â£224m for housing, schools and other infrastructure, and Â£630m for the NHS and councils. Meanwhile Â£200m will be set aside to support businesses. Welsh Conservatives say business rate relief should continue, but ministers want to see what the chancellor will announce for England first. The Welsh Government said it is waiting to hear what Rishi Sunak says about business rates in his UK government budget speech on Wednesday, and what that means for Wales. It comes as the cash Welsh ministers expect to receive for Covid-19 spending from the UK government is expected to be less than a sixth of the Â£5bn it has had for 2020-21. Plaid Cymru said Â£200m was a ""drop in the ocean"" for businesses. Wales to receive extra Â£650m from Treasury Extra Â£1.6bn for Covid vaccine rollout Second homes tax hike for Wales spending plan The Welsh Government has finalised its spending plans for 2021-22, which they began to spell out in draft form last December and is worth more than Â£17bn. In the first financial year of the pandemic, Wales was given an extra Â£5bn to spend on Covid by the UK government. Under current plans, this is expected to fall to Â£766m.Ministers only announced plans for how they would spend 10% of thatin December. Since then, another Â£650m has been announced by the Treasury for the Welsh Government as a result of additional Covid spending in England. The final budget confirms some of the extra items that the Welsh Government is spending money on, with the pots of money it had left over from last year. Money for the pandemic is additional to the Â£17bn the Welsh Government spends on other policies. It has control in Wales of the NHS, education, environmental spending and transport. Some of the cash will be used for the Welsh Government's vaccination programme The Welsh Government says it is setting aside Â£200m extra for businesses in its reserves. It is not decided how that will be spent, and it is not yet clear if an existing business rate relief scheme will continue into the next financial year. All retail, leisure and hospitality businesses with a rateable value of Â£500,000 or below are receiving 100% non-domestic rates relief until the end of March. A similar scheme is operational in England and reports suggest it will continue - Welsh ministers say they are waiting to see how much extra money there is from the Treasury on Wednesday. Rebecca Evans told BBC Wales the scheme has cost around Â£360m in the current financial year. ""We would love the chancellor to say that he is intending to continue with the rate relief system,"" she said. But she said the ""sheer"" amount of funding to continue to offer it in Wales means it would need extra money from the UK government. Most firms closed by lockdown are still awaiting a date on when they can reopen. Mark Newbold, who owns two pubs near Bridgend, called for more clarity on support for the hospitality sector. ""I know they've put away Â£200m but that's not enough to support the whole industry,"" he said. ""There are so many businesses that have lost so much money especially last year with the great summer we had."" This video can not be played First Minister Mark Drakeford announced some of the cash at a press conference on Monday The Welsh Government says it is allocating another Â£224.5m on capital funding - cash spent on infrastructure. That includes Â£147m on housing programmes and Â£30m for new schools. An extra Â£8m will be given to councils and Natural Resources Wales to repair damage caused by flooding in December and January, and on wider flooding protection work. Another Â£20m will be earmarked for walking and cycling routes, which the Welsh Government said would increase total investment in active travel for the year to Â£75m. Housing schemes will be among the beneficiaries of the final budget At a press conference on Monday, First Minister Mark Drakeford announced Â£682m in new spending, with some of the money being used to support the vaccination programme. A total of Â£630m will go on the NHS and councils, including Â£206m for a local government hardship fund to support social care and ensure schools can adapt. NHS services will get Â£380m, and contact tracing will receive Â£50m. Another Â£10.5m will go to supporting vulnerable people, while Â£18.6m will be spent on public transport. Welsh Conservative finance spokesman Mark Isherwood said: ""The pandemic has devastated the Welsh economy and people and businesses are crying out for more support from Labour ministers so we can support families and save Welsh jobs, but those cries have been sadly ignored. ""After over two decades in power and numerous budgets, successive Labour Governments in Cardiff Bay have failed to deliver for hardworking people, and sadly there's little reason to believe that this budget will be any different - it will only take us back to the same old normal under Labour."" Plaid Cymru economy spokeswoman Helen Mary Jones said there were ""large gaps"" in the budget. ""By refusing to extend the eligibility criteria for free school meals and to freeze council tax, Labour is failing to protect the most vulnerable from the impact of the pandemic."" She added: ""Â£200m is but a drop in the ocean for businesses who are, like the hospitality sector, on their knees and kept awake at night fearing closure and redundancies."" Most of the cash the Welsh Government spends comes directly from the Treasury in London, but about 17% is raised through devolved taxes. They include part of income tax, land transaction tax - the Welsh version of stamp duty - and landfill tax. Among the announcements in December was a tax hike on second homes, to raise Â£13m for social housing. Although this is called the final budget for the coming financial year, the reality is that it's likely to see many more amendments in the months to come. The pandemic remains unpredictable, as does the state of the economy, so some of the most recent spending commitments are for a six-month period. The chancellor's budget on Wednesday will change things too. If the reports of an extension to the business rate holiday in England are correct, Welsh Government may well follow suit here - new spending decisions for England mean more money on the way to Wales. And there's a Senedd election looming in May, so there may be a few late Easter bunnies being pulled out of hats. What's more, a change of government - or a new coalition agreement - would mean changed spending priorities.

"Football academy player 'endured living hell'Within months of joining Ipswich Town at 16, Swansea midfielder Lewis Reed says he felt suicidal.Wales","This video can not be played Lewis Reed says he wants better support for young players A footballer endured a ""living hell"" at a football academy he joined aged 16 that left him suicidal, he revealed. Lewis Reed, from Swansea, wants better support for young players after his experiences at Ipswich Town FC. Now aged 19, the Covid pandemic led to Mr Reed's contract not being renewed, but his time away from the game has given him ""the confidence"" to speak up. Ipswich Town said it was ""disappointed"" to hear of his concerns and was seeking a meeting with Mr Reed to discuss them. The Professional Footballers' Association (PFA) has said it was ""saddened to read Lewis Reed's account of his experience within football and applaud him for speaking out so candidly"". Midfielder Mr Reed said he went from ""such a high"" to ""feeling so low"" at the club, in a matter of months. He told the BBC it hit his parents ""really hard"" especially, because they had been used to seeing their son every day as someone who was ""absolutely loving life as everything was going his way"". ""[But then they had gone to] not seeing him and in that time of not seeing him for his life to become a living hell. Lewis Reed joined Ipswich Town's academy at the age of 16 ""[My mum would] come off the phone and say to my dad that would be the last time she'd speak to her sonâ¦ they were concerned suicide might have been on my mind, and at times it was."" Mr Reed described feeling ""invisible"" to coaching staff and disappointed that he ""didn't get the opportunity to play"" more frequently at the club. And after struggling with ""extreme pain"" from an in-growing toenail, Mr Reed said he was told to ""man-up"". ""Every time my parents rang they thought it might be the last time they would speak to me,"" he said. His family decided to approach the club for help and Mr Reed later attended a counselling session. But he declined the offer of more as he didn't feel like it had helped. ""I actually got more support from the security guard on the gate,"" Mr Reed continued. ""Me and him would have a chat for 30-40 minutes and I felt he was more supportive than some of the coaches at the club."" PFA sees 'spike' in players seeking help FC Not Alone - the mental health football club Prince William on lockdown, football and mental health When his contract was not renewed last year, he said he received no communication from the club. ""We are 16, 17, 18 out of school straight into a tough environment, it's all we've known, football, football and more football, there's no guidance on what the next step is going to be,"" he said. The PFA said it had contacted Mr Reed to offer him support. ""We know that a career in football can be challenging for all players and their families, but particularly young players,"" it said in a statement. ""Over the past decade, the players' union has led the way in putting mental health firmly on football's agenda, providing 24/7 wellbeing support and encouraging personal development."" Mr Reed, who is now interning at his family's business, is calling for a change in the academy system with more support for young players away from home, and on release from contract. In a statement, Ipswich Town said they were ""obviously very disappointed"" to hear of Mr Reed's comments and were currently arranging a meeting with him. ""Our Academy is very highly regarded and we have been assured by all the authorities including the PFA that we have met and exceeded all the protocols around player welfare,"" the club said. ""We will be issuing a much broader statement in due course but if there are any lessons to be learnt from speaking to Lewis, we want to take them on board.""

The billionaire building 'a British Ferrari',"This video can not be played Lawrence Stroll says he wants Aston Martin to have the strongest profile of any luxury car brand This week sees the return of one of the most evocative names in the British car industry to the top level of motorsport. On Wednesday, Aston Martin will unveil its first Formula 1 car in more than 60 years. The move into F1 is the keystone of a bold plan to revive the flagging fortunes of the company and turn it into a sporting and commercial brand to rival Ferrari. It is the brainchild of Canadian billionaire and executive chairman Lawrence Stroll. His intention, he says, is to build a business that will have ""the strongest profile of any luxury automotive brand"". In early 2020, Aston Martin Lagonda was in deep trouble. Sales were poor, and the company was burning through cash. Its shares, launched on the London stock market in 2018, had been haemorrhaging value. Lawrence Stroll provided a lifeline. A billionaire who made most of his money through investments in luxury designer brands, notably Tommy Hilfiger and Michael Kors, he led a group of investors who were willing to inject new funds into Aston Martin. The need for those funds became more acute when the effects of the Covid pandemic emerged and the industry ground to a halt. The move left Mr Stroll as executive chairman - and in charge of the company. Meanwhile, he had already taken control of an F1 team, after leading a bid for the assets of Force India, which went into administration in 2018. The Aston Martin Valkyrie on its public debut at Silverstone These elements are now coming together. The F1 team, which spent two seasons competing as Racing Point, has been rebranded as Aston Martin. When it takes to the track this year, it will be the first time an Aston Martin has competed in F1 since a largely unsuccessful foray in 1959 and 1960. With four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel and Mr Stroll's son Lance as the team's drivers, it will be used to focus attention on the car company, which has been heavily restructured. The parallels with Ferrari are evident and Mr Stroll clearly admires his Italian rivals. ""Ferrari has a great business model, and there are a great deal of similarities,"" he explains. ""But Aston Martin has a British, iconic 108-year history. If I'm not mistaken, about 50 years longer than Ferrari! ""F1, for a luxury performance automotive company, is the greatest platform in the world."" F1, he argues, provides both a marketing platform and an environment in which technology can be developed and refined for the next generation of roadgoing sports cars. But the car industry is changing, and while policymakers around the world are increasingly forcing manufacturers to look towards electric cars, F1 appears to have no plans to abandon fossil fuels. ""F1 already uses the lowest emission power units in the world, which sadly is the world's best kept secret,"" says Mr Stroll. The F1 community, he insists, is well aware of the direction in which the world is going, and has ambitious plans for new technologies to mitigate emissions further, using new engines and special fuels. F1 billionaire owner leads rescue deal Mercedes to take 20% stake in luxury brand 'I saved Â£5,000 by charging my electric car for free' Meanwhile electrification, he says, should not be a problem for the sportscar business. ""The most important thing for any company, as far as I'm concerned, is its brand. We have the greatest iconic brand in Aston Martin,"" he says. Electric and hybrid technology, he explains, can simply be brought in from the German firm Mercedes-Benz. The two companies have a technical partnership, while Mercedes' parent company Daimler also has a 20% stake in Aston Martin. So as far as he is concerned the issue for the future is not so much the technology itself, as how it is sold. He has made clear, too, that a major part of Aston's brand identity is its British heritage. This is, after all, the brand marketed around the world as James Bond's company car of choice. Four Aston Martins will feature in the next Bond movie, No Time To Die But Mr Stroll is Canadian. His chief executive, Tobias Moers, is German. Aston Martin's shareholders are international. So what is really left of that British identity? ""There are about 2,500 people who work between here [in the Gaydon headquarters] and in Wales,"" he says. ""There are another 500 people that work at the F1 factory in Silverstone. ""As far as leadership is concerned, I most definitely am Canadian. I've had Canadian businesses, American businesses. ""All the experience I have of building some of the best luxury businesses around the world will be brought into this business. ""But its roots and its heritage and about 99% of its employees are most definitely British.""

UK cruise ships end up as scrap on Indian beach,"The Marco Polo was built in the 1960s and was one of the world's last surviving ocean cruise liners Two UK cruise ships have been scrapped on an Indian beach despite assurances they would continue to be operated. Ships at the end of their lives are considered hazardous waste and it is illegal to send them to developing countries from the UK. But months after being sold at auction to buyers outside the UK they were then sold on as scrap for double the price. As they were set to be used for further trading when they left UK waters, their arrival in India does not break UK law. An investigation by the BBC's File on 4 programme found at least 13 other ships, mostly cargo ships, linked to the UK had arrived at the scrapping beaches of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh since the start of 2020. The Marco Polo and the Magellan were sold at auction in November after their owners Cruise and Maritime Voyages went into administration. The Marco Polo was built in the 1960s and was one of the world's last surviving ocean cruise liners. It was scheduled to take UK passengers to the Amazon and Norway this year, but its final voyage was to Alang in India. The ship-breaking yards of Alang dominate a stretch of muddy beach just up the coast from Mumbai in north-west India, referred to as the world's largest ship graveyard. The ship was bought at auction for around Â£2m by offshore company Highseas Ltd. After the sale, it was released from UK waters on the condition it would be used for ""further trading"". HighSeas Ltd said the cruise ship would be used as a floating hotel in Dubai. But two months after taking ownership of the Marco Polo, it was sold as scrap for around Â£4m. HighSeas Ltd director Rishi Arggawal said it was always their intention the Marco Polo would be sold to new owners ""but regrettably, the intended buyers in Dubai refused to take delivery"". Mr Arggawal said they tried to find new work for the Marco Polo as a cruise ship or a hotel without success, before selling to ""Indian interests"". It is a similar story for the Magellan, which was meant to be used as a floating hotel in Liverpool for the 2021 Grand National. It was bought at the auction by a Greek ship owner. Brokers say it was sold on for scrap after no new buyer was found. The cruise ship industry do send old ships to be scrapped safely at EU-approved yards, but when sold at auction, which often happens when a company goes into administration, this decision is taken out of the previous owner's hands. There are serious concerns about the environmental impact and working conditions in the ship-breaking industry across south Asia. Each year around 800 ships come to the end of their lives and need to be broken apart and recycled. Although this work can be carried out in the UK and other EU-approved ship-breaking yards, around 70% of the world's ships end up on the beaches of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh as these yards offer much higher prices for scrap steel. Uncovering the oil industry's dirty secret The organisation Ship-breaking Platform has documented the deaths of more than 400 workers on these beaches since 2009. It has recorded fatal accidents in the yards from workers falling from height and being killed in gas explosions, as well as longer-term sickness from exposure to toxic materials such as asbestos. There are serious concerns about the environmental impact of the ship-breaking industry across south Asia Ship-breaking Platform's director, Ingvild Jenssen, said despite laws in place making it illegal for developed countries like the UK to send hazardous waste such as old ships to developing countries, they continue to arrive ""There is a lot of value in these vessels because they contain large amounts of steel,"" she said. ""But they also contain large amounts of hazardous materials: asbestos; heavy metals; lead, and many materials you need to take large precautions when you're dealing with them."" Ship recycling consultant Merijn Hougee from Sea2Cradle says asbestos is not treated as a hazardous material in India. ""If you have a vessel built in the 60s, it is likely there are larger amounts of asbestos on board. There's a ban on asbestos in Europe, but in India, it's freely being traded and sold and used as second-hand building materials."" A ship-breaking worker in India who spoke to the BBC said they ""pump waste, like oil and petrol, into the sea when clearing out a ship, or we use it to burn other materials on the shore"". He said he has been badly burned on two occasions and did not receive sick pay while recovering. Once he had to be driven an hour away to hospital as the one near the yards did not have the facilities to deal with serious injuries. UK shadow environment secretary Luke Pollard believes tighter, global regulation is needed to ensure that British-owned ships end up being recycled by approved ship-breaking yards. ""I don't think the public want to see ships that were owned by British companies polluting beaches all around the world. I think they want to see them properly disposed of, properly recycled."" The UK government said: ""The illegal export of waste is a significant threat to the global environment, and those convicted could face two years in prison or an unlimited fine.""

The F1 team, which spent two seasons competing as Racing Point, has been rebranded as Aston Martin. When it takes to the track this year, it will be the first time an Aston Martin has competed in F1 since a largely unsuccessful foray in 1959 and 1960. With four-time world champion Sebastian Vettel and Mr Stroll's son Lance as the team's drivers, it will be used to focus attention on the car company, which has been heavily restructured. The parallels with Ferrari are evident and Mr Stroll clearly admires his Italian rivals. ""Ferrari has a great business model, and there are a great deal of similarities,"" he explains. ""But Aston Martin has a British, iconic 108-year history. If I'm not mistaken, about 50 years longer than Ferrari! ""F1, for a luxury performance automotive company, is the greatest platform in the world."" F1, he argues, provides both a marketing platform and an environment in which technology can be developed and refined for the next generation of roadgoing sports cars. But the car industry is changing, and while policymakers around the world are increasingly forcing manufacturers to look towards electric cars, F1 appears to have no plans to abandon fossil fuels. ""F1 already uses the lowest emission power units in the world, which sadly is the world's best kept secret,"" says Mr Stroll. The F1 community, he insists, is well aware of the direction in which the world is going, and has ambitious plans for new technologies to mitigate emissions further, using new engines and special fuels. F1 billionaire owner leads rescue deal Mercedes to take 20% stake in luxury brand 'I saved Â£5,000 by charging my electric car for free' Meanwhile electrification, he says, should not be a problem for the sportscar business. ""The most important thing for any company, as far as I'm concerned, is its brand. We have the greatest iconic brand in Aston Martin,"" he says. Electric and hybrid technology, he explains, can simply be brought in from the German firm Mercedes-Benz. The two companies have a technical partnership, while Mercedes' parent company Daimler also has a 20% stake in Aston Martin. So as far as he is concerned the issue for the future is not so much the technology itself, as how it is sold. He has made clear, too, that a major part of Aston's brand identity is its British heritage. This is, after all, the brand marketed around the world as James Bond's company car of choice. Four Aston Martins will feature in the next Bond movie, No Time To Die But Mr Stroll is Canadian. His chief executive, Tobias Moers, is German. Aston Martin's shareholders are international. So what is really left of that British identity? ""There are about 2,500 people who work between here [in the Gaydon headquarters] and in Wales,"" he says. ""There are another 500 people that work at the F1 factory in Silverstone. ""As far as leadership is concerned, I most definitely am Canadian. I've had Canadian businesses, American businesses. ""All the experience I have of building some of the best luxury businesses around the world will be brought into this business. ""But its roots and its heritage and about 99% of its employees are most definitely British.""

Five things to watch for in Budget,"Chancellors typically view Budgets as political theatre - a moment to set the tone as they show off their wisdom, generosity and vision for the future. But when Rishi Sunak lays out the government's tax and spending plans on Wednesday it will not be him taking centre stage, but the ongoing crisis engulfing the nation's health and finances. The government has borrowed a record Â£270bn so far fighting the pandemic and has to come up with a way of paying it back. But it also needs to continue supporting the millions still out of work or on furlough due to lockdown. What is the Budget and when will it happen? How much will coronavirus cost the UK? Ahead of the speech, Mr Sunak has promisedmore money for the vaccination rollout;a Â£5bn scheme to help High Street businesses reopen;and a mortgage guarantee scheme to help first-time buyers. But he's warned of tough economic times ahead and there are reports that he plans to raise some taxes. Here are five things to look out for in Wednesday's speech: The chancellor has already said he ""is preparing a Budget that provides support for people"" as unemployment hovers at a five-year high and four million workers are on furlough. On Wednesday, he is set to announce the furlough support scheme will be extended until the end of September, with employers asked to contribute to workers' salaries from July. From then, employers will be expected to contribute 10%, increasing to 20% in August and September, as the economy reopens. Employees will continue to receive 80% of their salary for hours not worked until the scheme ends. He is also tipped to extend a Â£20-per-week uplift to Universal Credit for six months, after intense pressure from MPs and charities to do more to help the poor get through the pandemic. Some want him to go further and make the uplift permanent - but the chancellor may resist as he struggles to get government borrowing under control. How does the furlough scheme work? How could the Budget affect universal credit? Mr Sunak may have promised grants of up to Â£18,000 to get businesses going again, but the bigger question is what he will do about business rates. MPs across the board say the tax, which is calculated using the value of a company's premises, is unfair and outdated. The boss of Next, Lord Simon Wolfson,recently told the BBC that a huge number of shops will have to close unnecessarily.high streets couldif rates aren't reformed. The chancellor is likely to leave the thorny question of what to do about rates - including levying a so called ""Amazon tax"" on online retailers - until the autumn. However, reports suggest he will extend the business rates holiday - brought in last year to support shops - beyond its current end date of 31 March and into the summer. Despite the anticipated generosity, the chancellor has said he will use the Budget to ""level"" with the public about the challenges facing the economy and the need to repay the vast sums of public money spent during the crisis. According to reports, Mr Sunak is likely to announce some tax increases - although whatever he does will have to fit around with the Conservative party manifesto pledge not to raise income tax, national insurance or VAT. Some think he will instead raise corporation tax from its current level of 19% to 23%, which is still below the G7 average. The rise would be staggered over the course of the parliament, reportedly bringing in Â£12bn. There are also rumours he will freeze the personal income tax allowance, which usually rises in line with inflation, pushing many taxpayers into higher bands and netting HMRC about Â£6bn. Tory backbenchers are strongly opposed to tax rises, while the Labour leader Keir Starmer has warned they risk ""choking off"" a rapid economic recovery. But ex-Conservative leader Lord Hague has said ""personal and business"" taxes must rise to help government finances. Southampton is teaming up with Portsmouth as part of a south coast freeport bid The chancellor is likely to set out his vision for a post-Covid (and post-Brexit) economy, which could mean more money for ""levelling up"" different parts of the UK. According to the Financial Times, he is preparing to announce the locations offreeports- special economic zones with low taxes that would help stimulate regional growth. He's also expected to announce more funding to help the UK meet its decarbonisation goals. There are likely to be measures to promote more environmentally friendly homes and renewable energy - but he is not expected to raise fuel duty. The stamp duty holiday introduced last year not only propped up the housing market at the start of the crisis, but also drove up the average value of a home by 8.5% in 2020. That tax break is up at the end of March, and many buyers have found themselves facing big bills if they don't complete their transactions on time. However, Mr Sunak will extend stamp duty holiday to prevent this cliff edge, reports suggest. The government mortgage guarantee scheme will offer 95% mortgages for houses worth up to Â£600,000. It is based on the Help to Buy mortgage guarantee scheme, which closed to new loans at the end of 2016. This is a policy that the Treasury says ""reinvigorated the market for high loan-to-value lending after the 2008 financial crisis"". But housing charity Shelter said that scheme increased house prices by 1.4%, making housing less affordable for many. What is the stamp duty holiday and when does it end?

Crucial Budget for business,"There has arguably never been a moment in living memory where business and government need each other more than now. Clinging together like the passengers in the front car of a rollercoaster - this Budget is the moment the photo is snapped after the sickening plunge, grimaces fixed for the ride ahead. Business needs the government to go on another massive spending splurge to get us to the other side of lockdown. In many ways, the ""roadmap"" out of lockdown already told us the most important stuff that will be in the Budget. Furlough, the business rates holiday, additional grants and VAT deferrals and cuts for hospitality are all pretty much guaranteed to the end of June, when the government hopes firms will be able to operate with few restrictions. After that, the roles start to reverse. Westminster will need help from businesses to preserve and create millions of jobs. Companies will need incentives to invest, build, hire and train - particularly younger workers who have suffered the most and on whose economic future the success of this moment may be judged for decades. Governments can encourage, but ultimately it is businesses which create. Budget 2021: The challenges facing Rishi Sunak Mortgage guarantee to help buyers with 5% deposit BBC editors on what to expect in the Budget Increased capital allowances, the expansion of youth training programmes and subsidies like the Kickstart Scheme are all expected in a speech behind which the mantra ""jobs, jobs, jobs"" will be almost audible from the Treasury building. The tight embrace between government and business seems a long way since the concerns of business were swatted away with a four-letter ""swish"" by a prime minister who saw them as an irritant in the project of getting Brexit done. The UK is in more debt than it's been in for more than 50 years. At over Â£2 trillion, it is equivalent to 100% of its entire annual income for the first time since the early 1960s, when debt was still on a downward trajectory from spending on World War Two. By far the most powerful weapon against debt is growth: it has a doubly positive effect. It increases the denominator (the bottom number) of the debt to GDP ratio, while reducing the numerator (the top bit) by keeping the bill for benefits like Universal Credit lower. That is why the next twist on this rollercoaster ride is the most perilous. No-one really knows how many of the almost five million workers still on furlough have a job to go back to. More than anything, this Budget is about how many of them can return to, or find new, work. This video can not be played What factors could shape Rishi Sunak's thinking in his 2021 Budget? There will be some eye-catching whizzes and bangs as the government experiments with ideas like freeports, drums up extra funding for start-ups and proposes looser stock market listing rules to grow new firms and attract international investors. But sooner or later - and I suspect the emphasis will be later than recent headlines suggest - the government will need businesses help to pay off some the UK's enormous debts. Corporation tax will rise slowly. But this is perhaps a good example of how little politics figures in this Budget. The chancellor arguably has more to fear from his own backbenches than he does from a Labour party, who find themselves in the unusual position of siding with the very MPs in their opposition on tax rises on businesses - who already enjoy the lowest rates in the G8. But corporation tax is pretty small beer anyway. It contributes less than 8% of all tax collected by the government, compared with the 45% it receives from income tax and National Insurance from individuals who have - you guessed it - jobs, jobs, jobs. The government is also scared that the ""free money"" window may be closing. Ever since the financial crisis, governments have been able to borrow at close to zero rates of interest. There are signs that is changing. A 1% rise in borrowing costs will cost the government five times more than it will get by raising the corporation tax rate by 1%. That is why the government and businesses will need to hold each others' hands on a ride they really are in together. What is the Budget and when will it happen?

Â£5bn fund to help High Street,"A Â£5bn scheme for High Street shops and hospitality firms in England has been unveiled, with Rishi Sunak promising more support to come for the economy. Ahead of Wednesday's Budget, the chancellor said the grants, worth as much as Â£18,000 per firm, will help them reopen as England eases lockdown. It was broadly welcomed by firms but some groups said it was not enough. Despite concerns about the country's debt, Mr Sunak told the BBC's Marr show his priority was still jobs and firms. The chancellor said public finances faced ""enormous strains"" due to the pandemic. ""I want to level with people about the challenges we face,"" he said. But the new Â£5bn grant scheme would help people ""reopen their businesses"" and is ""the right thing to do now"", Mr Sunak said. Sunak pledges help in 'remaining stages' of crisis Budget 2021: The challenge facing Sunak He said it had been an ""incredibly difficult year"" for the High Street and hospitality sectors, and the grants would give them the ""support they need to get them through, get them back on their feet"". It was, he said, part of a range of support measures since the start of the pandemic and would continue. ""We went big, we went early - and there's more to come,"" he told Marr. This video can not be played Chancellor Rishi Sunak says the shock to the economy cannot be fixed overnight The chancellor has faced calls to raise taxes from some parts of the Tory party, while Labour and other Conservative MPs have opposed increases. There are newspaper reports this weekend suggesting Mr Sunak could freeze some income tax thresholds for three years and raise corporation tax. However, the chancellor would not comment on tax measures, saying more would be disclosed in the Budget. The government has so far borrowed Â£271bn this financial year - up Â£222bn on 2019-20. This has pushed the national debt to Â£2.13 trillion. Nearly 700,000 shops, restaurants, hotels, hair salons, gyms and other businesses in England, will be eligible for the so-called ""restart grants"", to be distributed directly to firms by local authorities from April. It will replace the current monthly grant system. The funding takes the total spent on direct grants to businesses during the pandemic to Â£25bn, the Treasury said. The devolved nations will receive equivalent extra funding. Non-essential shops in England, along with outdoor hospitality, will be allowed to reopen from 12 April at the earliest. What is the Budget and when will it happen? Will the vaccine be a Budget recovery blueprint? Other announcements ahead of Mr Sunak's annual economic speech on Wednesday, have included: a new government-backed mortgage guarantee schemefor home buyers with small deposits an ""elite"" visa to encourage high-skilled workers including researchers, engineers and scientists to come to the UK Â£126m for traineeships anda ""flexi-job"" apprenticeship in England and a ""world-first"" green savings bond for retail investors to help boost the UK's transition to net zero emissions. Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, welcomed the ""much-needed lifeline"" provided to businesses by the grants, but called for the chancellor to set out more funding ""for those that have been excluded from income support throughout this crisis"". UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said businesses were ""crying out for the cash"" and urged the grants to be paid as soon as possible. And Helen Dickinson, of the British Retail Consortium, which represents chain stores, said the latest money was a ""vital injection of funding"" but warned it would ""only provide temporary relief"" if the business rate holiday did not continue. Other groups called for the extension of the furlough scheme and the temporary reduction in value added tax (VAT) on hospitality sales. Last year was the worst for the High Street in more than 25 years as the pandemic accelerated the move towards online shopping,with more than 180,000 jobs lostin retail alone, according to the Centre for Retail Research. Some Conservative MPs, such as former Brexit secretary David Davis, have spoken out against attempts to increase taxes. But Conservative former chancellor Lord Clarke has encouraged Mr Sunak to consider raising VAT, national insurance and income taxes in order to repair the public finances. Labour has said it opposes tax rises in the short-term and has called for a Â£20 uplift in universal credit to be kept. The party also called for more help for young people to avoid a ""lost generation scarred by unemployment"". On Sunday, economists at the respected EY Item Club said it was right for the chancellor to continue nursing the economy through recovery rather than introduce Budget measures to re-build the country's battered finances. Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the Item Club, said: ""Despite an almost unprecedented peacetime deficit, serious action to repair the public finances can wait. The chancellor's focus should still be on supporting the economy through the pandemic and premature fiscal tightening could undermine recovery. ""With the cost of government debt still historically low, there is no evidence yet of any significant constraint on government borrowing."" EXPLAINED:What is the Budget and when will it happen?

"Chancellor set to unveil Â£400m Budget arts boostThe funds will aim to help museums, theatres and galleries in England reopen once restrictions ease.","This video can not be played Kwarteng: Chancellor to extend furlough scheme Business support including furlough and the VAT cut for hospitality firms will continue ""while lockdown persists"", the business secretary has said. With Covid-19 restrictions set to end by June at the earliest, Kwasi Kwarteng told the BBC it was important not to ""crush"" any potential recovery. Ahead of Wednesday's Budget, Rishi Sunak said he would protect jobs using the ""full firepower"" at his disposal. But he also promised honesty about his plans to ""fix"" the public finances. He faces a potential row with some Conservative MPs if he imposes tax increases, amid warnings they could stifle economic growth. And Labour is urging him to abandon planned council tax rises in England. What is the Budget and when will it happen? Five things to look out for in the Budget The most crucial Budget for business in a generation Â£5bn fund to help High Street recover from Covid In his Budget statement, which is due to get under way at around 12.30 GMT on Wednesday, the chancellor will commit the government to doing ""whatever it takes to support the British people and businesses through this moment of crisis"". He is set to extend the Â£20-a-week top up to universal credit for six months to help struggling households, a government source told the BBC. The chancellor spoke to people who have benefitted from government schemes to support employment from the Treasury Other support is expected to include: Â£408m for museums, theatres and galleries in England to help them reopen when Covid restrictions ease Â£150m to help communities take over pubs in danger of closing Â£300m summer sports recovery package, including cash for English cricket He is also expected to set out his plans to tackle the huge hole in the government's balance sheet - caused by the high levels of borrowing and debt built up during the pandemic, and the hit to tax revenues from the closure of many sectors of the economy. ""Once we are on the way to recovery, we will need to begin fixing the public finances - and I want to be honest about our plans to do that,"" he is expected to say. The Budget won't just be about carrying on the emergency support, with a hefty dollop of Brand Sunak, with a TV press conference and sofa chat on Wednesday evening, on top of the traditional red box doorstep and green bench moments. It will also be about how he hopes to return the Tories to their more traditional trademark - being careful with the country's cash. There won't be a return to the kind of political argument over the deficit and the debate that David Cameron and George Osborne dominated in the early part of the last decade. As one Treasury minister said: ""Austerity? You just can't do it now."" Read Laura's full blog The Budget comes at a very difficult time for businesses and government finances. Official figures show the UKeconomy contracted by 9.9%last year and unemploymentrose to 5.1%in the three months to December - the worst rate since 2015. With its takings down and its spending up, the government isexpected to borrow Â£394bnduring the current financial year - the highest figure seen in peacetime. The furlough scheme,currently paying up to 80% of six million people's salaries,is scheduled to stop at the end of April. But the prime minister's ""roadmap"" for easing Covid-19 restrictions says the final legal limits on social contact and business activity will end no earlier than 21 June. This video can not be played What factors could shape Rishi Sunak's thinking in his 2021 Budget? Asked on BBC Breakfast if the job support scheme would continue, Mr Kwarteng said the chancellor had ""already indicated that we will be extending furlough"". And he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think it's a fairly good assumption that, while lockdown persists, there will be additional support."" Mr Kwarteng said there would ""perhaps be an extension"" of the reduced - 5% - rate of VAT for the hospitality sector, also due to end in 31 March. If vaccines continued to be rolled out ""efficiently"" and the roadmap was followed, there was ""every chance that the economy can bounce back"", he argued. ""We can see strong growth at the end of 2021, and that will be the best way to deal with the growing deficit or to try and reduce it,"" Mr Kwarteng said. The chancellor will promise help to save endangered pubs Mr Sunak is reportedly planning to increase corporation tax to as much as 25%, from the current 19%, to reduce pressure on public finances. Some Conservative MPs, including former Brexit Secretary David Davis, say this would impede recovery and are warning they will resist this or any similar moves. But former Conservative leader Lord Haguewrote in the Daily Telegraph,externalthat, after 12 months of heavy public borrowing to pay for furlough and other schemes, ""at least some business and personal taxes"" would have to rise. For Labour, shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said now was ""not the time"" for tax rises, but has signalled the opposition could support an increase in corporation tax in the future. She has said the plannedcouncil tax rise of up to 5%in England in April should not go ahead at a time ""when people are losing jobs"". What is the Budget and when will it happen?

Join us for more coverage tomorrow. Here's a recap of some of the latest stories from around the world: The UK government's global travel taskforce has met for the first time to start planning the UK's return to foreign travel. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps held a meeting with government departments, travel firms, transport operators and industry bodies. Boris Johnson announced last month that foreign leisure travel for people in England could be permitted from May 17 at the earliest. This is dependant on various factors related to the coronavirus pandemic, such as vaccine rollouts and the prevalence of Covid-19 variants. The taskforce will give a report to the prime minister on April 12 setting out recommendations for how and when overseas trips could resume.  Shapps says: ""The UK's leading vaccine rollout has created a wave of optimism and, as a result, the global travel taskforce is charged with exploring safe and secure ways to restart international travel when the time is right."" He added: ""We will not only consider the progress of our world-beating domestic vaccine programme, but also need to review where destination countries have got to with both vaccine and testing capabilities."" Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China aims to deliver 560 million doses within four months China has so
far delivered more than 52.5 million Covid-19 vaccinations. If these are single
doses, that means that roughly 3-4% of the countryâs 1.4 billion population have been
inoculated. However, the
country has ambitious plans to rapidly step up its vaccination programme over
the next four months.  Today, Chinaâs top respiratory disease expert Zhong
Nanshan confirmed that Chinaâs centre for disease control and preventionhad plans to administer 40 doses per 100 people by the end of June,external. It was perhaps
to be expected that China had plans to imminently accelerate its domestic
vaccine drive, given that it alreadyhas the capacity to produce at least one billion doses,externaland is increasinglyrolling out vaccine aid overseas - to at least 53 developing countries,external. Chinaâs had
some practice at rolling out medical care to huge populations. It showed last
year that it had the capacity to mass-test entire cities with millions of
residents for Covid-19 within days. In October,it took just five days to test nine million residents across the eastern city of Qingdao. Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Sex workers have gathered outside the Dutch parliament, in protest at not being allowed to return to work when other contact professions can reopen for business on Wednesday. ""Sex work is work"" and ""no stigma"" are among the words written on the banners brandished by women dressed in red. All contact professionals - hairdressers, beauticians, tattoo artists  - can start seeing clients again from 3 March but sex workers can't. This might not strike you as surprising - in many countries these trades are considered entirely different - but here in the Netherlands they usually enjoy equal status.
Prostitution was legalised more than two decades ago. Sex workers pay taxes, the industry is tightly regulated.   But sex work is still considered too risky during the pandemic.
So they have brought their peep show to parliament along with a plea, to be allowed to get back to business. Iraq received 50,000 Sinopharm vaccines donated by China on Monday Iraq has begun its Covid-19 vaccination programme, as the
country struggles to contain a new spike in infections ahead of a historic
visit by Pope Francis. Front-line health workers were among the first people to
be vaccinated on Tuesday, a day after the arrival of 50,000 Sinopharm vaccines
donated by China. The government says it has ordered another two million doses
from Sinopharm to help protect the population of 40 million. It will also
receive at least two million Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines via the global Covax
scheme, while the World Bank has reportedly agreed to fund 1.5 million doses from
Pfizer-BioNTech. Iraq is battling a second wave of its epidemic. It reported
more than 4,600 new cases and 30 deaths on Tuesday, only six weeks after the daily
figures fell to 596 and three respectively. The government has imposed 24-hour curfews on Fridays,
Saturdays and Sundays to combat the surge, but huge crowds are still expected
to turn out to greet Pope Francis this weekend. The Pope, who has been vaccinated, chose Iraq for his
first international trip since the start of the pandemic despite his
predecessor Benedict XVI and others warning of the health and security risks. Marianna SpringDisinformation and social media reporter Twitter has
announced it plans toban users who repeatedly
tweet harmful misinformationabout Covid-19 vaccines. Under the scheme, members will face a lock being placed on their
account and if they accrue ""five strikes"", they face a permanent
ban. Twitter has said it will also start labelling
misleading tweets about the jab. Since the beginning of the pandemic - almost 12 months ago -
conspiracy influencers have grown huge followings on social media by repeatedly
sharing falsehoods about vaccines. I investigated the boom in the following of accounts promoting
anti-vaccine content on Twitter forBBC Panorama-
exposing the harm it had caused to communities across the UK. Vulnerable people I interviewed were scared off the vaccines by
the latest tactics of a committed minority of activists, who use Twitter and
other platforms. Twitter has repeatedly committed to tackling harmful misinformation
- but it will take some time to see whether this updated strike system results
in those repeat offenders having their accounts removed. While many of those influencers sharing vaccine mistruths in the
UK have already been suspended from the site, accounts of those in the US -
central to the disinformation ecosystem that repeatedly distorts stories about
the vaccine - remain live at this time. Forced cremations have prompted anger in minority communities Sri Lanka has chosen a remote island where the country's minority Christian and Muslim communities can bury their dead, following a row about the cremation of Covid victims. The government said Iranathivu island in the Gulf of Mannar northwest of the mainland had been chosen because it was thinly populated. The minorities had previously been forced to cremate their dead in line with the practice of the majority Buddhists, but the government backed down last week in the face of vehement criticism from rights groups. Muslims were angered by the ban, introduced last April, saying there was no scientific basis to claims that burials contaminated the groundwater. Muslims make up nearly 10% of the population. However, the head of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress,Rauff Hakeem, also criticised the latest move, saying it was ""pathetic racism"",external. Read more here One BBC reporter, Juliana
Gragnani, was on a flight arriving to Heathrow around the same time as the other
flight into London from Brazil, which has been the focus of some of Public
Health England's investigations as they try to trace the Brazil variant. She talked abouttravellersâ experiences at the time, here. Now, Juliana tells us how she has
been sent a kit to test for Covid, along with other passengers on her
flight: ""I had to travel last year to Brazil due to urgent family
matters. I quarantined before I returned, took a test, and flew back to the UK,
arriving in Heathrow on February 10th, via Paris. Both flights were packed. I
interviewed a few people who told me they were returning hastily before the
hotel quarantine was put in place. My flight, AF1580, arrived around the same
time as the SÃ£o Paulo-Zurich-London flight, where the case from Gloucestershire
was traced back to. Border control was very busy. Passengers from different
flights, including at least one from Italy, another from India, and both from
Brazil (via Paris and Zurich) were in a queue for three hours with no social
distancing. After quarantining for more than two weeks (just to make
sure), this afternoon I got a call from Test and Trace. Theyâre sending me a Covid kit and said this is being done with all passengers in my flight -
AF1580. They also asked if I had taken a test after arriving in England. Walk-in surge testing at The Mall in Cribbs Causeway after two cases of the Brazil variant were identified in South Gloucestershire There's been lots of discussion around the UK's discovery of six cases of a new coronavirus variant first discovered in Brazil - so here's where we are: Please save the date, says Hannah Ingram-Moore, who is organising a celebration of the life of her father, Captain Sir Tom Moore, on 30 April, which would have been his 101st birthday. At a private funeral over the weekend, she described her father, who raised almost Â£33m for NHS charities by walking laps of his garden,as ""a beacon of light and hope to the world"". Now she's planning an event through the Captain Tom Foundation for people all around the world to ""celebrate his generosity of spirit, the hope and joy he brought to millions and his sense of fun"". In a statement,externalposted on Twitter, she thanked people for their ""continuing support and compassion"" shown to her family over the past few weeks. ""On Saturday we were able to give my father a fitting send-off adhering to his wishes in every way,"" she wrote. ""We played music he loved, spoke words that filled us with joy and the addition of full military honours would have had him bursting with pride.""

Only a quarter of AstraZeneca doses delivered to France have been used Earlier we reported that France had revised its stance on the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine, allowing it for some people over the age of 65. President Emmanuel Macron has also said he would happily receive the jab if offered it. And yet just a month ago Mr Macron said the vaccine was ""almost ineffective"" in the over-65s, while his Europe minister was accusing the UK of taking ""massive risks"" by depending too heavily on it. So what has changed? Have the French now seen the limits of criticising AstraZeneca and come to understand that there can be no such thing as too many vaccines? Or have the UK's accusations of French vaccine nationalism been wide of the mark? As the BBC's Hugh Schofield reports, it's probably a mixture of the two. Artists from 41 countries will
appear live at Eurovision, organisers have told theBBCâs Newscast podcast. The contest's Martin Osterdahl says the performances were considered ""necessary travel"". But delegations will be limited to 20 people, down from an average of 38 in normal times, he says. He hopes there will be a live audience - but the decision has not been made yet. ""It makes a huge difference to the atmosphere of the broadcast if we have
some people present,"" he says. But if artists get âdouze pointsâ,
theyâll need to reconsider the usual exuberant celebrations. âWe want to avoid that people
start hugging and kissing each other in spouts of happiness,â says Osterdahl. Commentators like the BBCâs
Graham Norton will broadcast from ventilated commentary booths. âI certainly hope [Norton] will be

Secondary school pupils will take a Covid test before returning to the classroom on 8 March. Children of key workers have been at school since January so they've been key in helping schools prepare for mass testing. They've been showing our social affairs correspondent Fiona Lamdin how it's done. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm It looks like weâre
heading towards a third wave, is the message Swedenâs top state epidemiologist
Anders Tegnell delivered at the Swedish public health agencyâs latest news
conference. The agencyâs data suggest that the number of people being
hospitalised with Covid-19 is on the rise and there are concerns about the pace
at which the UK variant of Covid-19 is spreading. Sweden has never had a lockdown but has toughened its approach in recent
months, for example closing bars and restaurants early, and limiting organised
public gatherings to a maximum of eight people. Now, Tegnell has proposed that
from 6 March a maximum of 500 people should be allowed inside shopping malls
and large stores, a move that is expected to be approved by the government. There are already rules in place that require stores to ensure at least 10
square metres of space per customer, but there have been concerns
about overcrowding in shopping centres during recent school holidays. As we've been mentioning today, Chancellor Rishi Sunak will deliver the Budget tomorrow. Ahead of the speech, Sunak has promised:  So, what else you should be looking out for?

"Chancellor set to unveil Â£400m Budget arts boostThe funds will aim to help museums, theatres and galleries in England reopen once restrictions ease.UK Politics","This video can not be played Kwarteng: Chancellor to extend furlough scheme Business support including furlough and the VAT cut for hospitality firms will continue ""while lockdown persists"", the business secretary has said. With Covid-19 restrictions set to end by June at the earliest, Kwasi Kwarteng told the BBC it was important not to ""crush"" any potential recovery. Ahead of Wednesday's Budget, Rishi Sunak said he would protect jobs using the ""full firepower"" at his disposal. But he also promised honesty about his plans to ""fix"" the public finances. He faces a potential row with some Conservative MPs if he imposes tax increases, amid warnings they could stifle economic growth. And Labour is urging him to abandon planned council tax rises in England. What is the Budget and when will it happen? Five things to look out for in the Budget The most crucial Budget for business in a generation Â£5bn fund to help High Street recover from Covid In his Budget statement, which is due to get under way at around 12.30 GMT on Wednesday, the chancellor will commit the government to doing ""whatever it takes to support the British people and businesses through this moment of crisis"". He is set to extend the Â£20-a-week top up to universal credit for six months to help struggling households, a government source told the BBC. The chancellor spoke to people who have benefitted from government schemes to support employment from the Treasury Other support is expected to include: Â£408m for museums, theatres and galleries in England to help them reopen when Covid restrictions ease Â£150m to help communities take over pubs in danger of closing Â£300m summer sports recovery package, including cash for English cricket He is also expected to set out his plans to tackle the huge hole in the government's balance sheet - caused by the high levels of borrowing and debt built up during the pandemic, and the hit to tax revenues from the closure of many sectors of the economy. ""Once we are on the way to recovery, we will need to begin fixing the public finances - and I want to be honest about our plans to do that,"" he is expected to say. The Budget won't just be about carrying on the emergency support, with a hefty dollop of Brand Sunak, with a TV press conference and sofa chat on Wednesday evening, on top of the traditional red box doorstep and green bench moments. It will also be about how he hopes to return the Tories to their more traditional trademark - being careful with the country's cash. There won't be a return to the kind of political argument over the deficit and the debate that David Cameron and George Osborne dominated in the early part of the last decade. As one Treasury minister said: ""Austerity? You just can't do it now."" Read Laura's full blog The Budget comes at a very difficult time for businesses and government finances. Official figures show the UKeconomy contracted by 9.9%last year and unemploymentrose to 5.1%in the three months to December - the worst rate since 2015. With its takings down and its spending up, the government isexpected to borrow Â£394bnduring the current financial year - the highest figure seen in peacetime. The furlough scheme,currently paying up to 80% of six million people's salaries,is scheduled to stop at the end of April. But the prime minister's ""roadmap"" for easing Covid-19 restrictions says the final legal limits on social contact and business activity will end no earlier than 21 June. This video can not be played What factors could shape Rishi Sunak's thinking in his 2021 Budget? Asked on BBC Breakfast if the job support scheme would continue, Mr Kwarteng said the chancellor had ""already indicated that we will be extending furlough"". And he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think it's a fairly good assumption that, while lockdown persists, there will be additional support."" Mr Kwarteng said there would ""perhaps be an extension"" of the reduced - 5% - rate of VAT for the hospitality sector, also due to end in 31 March. If vaccines continued to be rolled out ""efficiently"" and the roadmap was followed, there was ""every chance that the economy can bounce back"", he argued. ""We can see strong growth at the end of 2021, and that will be the best way to deal with the growing deficit or to try and reduce it,"" Mr Kwarteng said. The chancellor will promise help to save endangered pubs Mr Sunak is reportedly planning to increase corporation tax to as much as 25%, from the current 19%, to reduce pressure on public finances. Some Conservative MPs, including former Brexit Secretary David Davis, say this would impede recovery and are warning they will resist this or any similar moves. But former Conservative leader Lord Haguewrote in the Daily Telegraph,externalthat, after 12 months of heavy public borrowing to pay for furlough and other schemes, ""at least some business and personal taxes"" would have to rise. For Labour, shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said now was ""not the time"" for tax rises, but has signalled the opposition could support an increase in corporation tax in the future. She has said the plannedcouncil tax rise of up to 5%in England in April should not go ahead at a time ""when people are losing jobs"". What is the Budget and when will it happen?

Starmer's Labour critics become increasingly vocal,"Nearly a year after Sir Keir Starmer became Labour leader, he is being accused of not listening to grassroots activists and not being strident enough in opposition. The focus of the discontent is his reluctance to call for an increase in corporation tax amidst the coronavirus pandemic. Those on the party's left are now publicly critical, but some current shadow ministers are privately worrying whether the party's positioning on the issue is right. Ian Lavery and Jon Trickett were shadow ministers under Jeremy Corbyn. They share Sir Keir's call for any council tax increases to be scrapped. But in a document to be published on Tuesday morning, they argue that corporation tax hits the profits of big businesses, rather than hard-pressed families. PM 'no doubt' of strong jobs recovery from Covid-19 Starmer sets out to make public finances a team sport Under the radar: Labour's search for direction And in a pre-Budget speech on Monday, another former shadow cabinet member, Richard Burgon, declared that unless Labour is bolder, it could be outflanked on business taxes by the Conservatives. Now one thing that unites all three former shadow ministers was their dismissal from the frontbench when Sir Keir assumed the leadership. The left of the party have been increasingly critical of Sir Keir - especially over the suspension of former leader Jeremy Corbyn. But they are now becoming more vocal on policy and positioning rather than personalities. There are now concerns that as the country emerges from the pandemic, some of the radical policies on which Sir Keir was elected by his membership - including increasing taxes on the better off - will be diluted. Some of those who know the Labour leader well suggest that these concerns are misplaced. The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, has signalled that Labour is open to increasing taxes on business in future. More immediately, the relatively new Labour leadership want to prove their pro-business credentials and to give a clear, unmuddied message that securing the recovery is the party's priority. Mr Lavery and Mr Trickett say they have consulted more than 1,000 activists and are giving the grassroots a voice. Support for wealth taxes runs strong amongst Labour supporters, they say, and the leadership needs to hear those views rather than make policy behind closed doors. But supporters of Sir Keir are sceptical that a sample of opinion selected by his critics is representative of the views of the wider membership. On Tuesday, Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw tweeted that Labour MPs had supported Sir Keir's stance at a meeting of the parliamentary party. Allow Twitter content?

UK cruise ships end up as scrap on Indian beachMonths after being sold to buyers from outside the UK they were sold on as scrap.UK,"The Marco Polo was built in the 1960s and was one of the world's last surviving ocean cruise liners Two UK cruise ships have been scrapped on an Indian beach despite assurances they would continue to be operated. Ships at the end of their lives are considered hazardous waste and it is illegal to send them to developing countries from the UK. But months after being sold at auction to buyers outside the UK they were then sold on as scrap for double the price. As they were set to be used for further trading when they left UK waters, their arrival in India does not break UK law. An investigation by the BBC's File on 4 programme found at least 13 other ships, mostly cargo ships, linked to the UK had arrived at the scrapping beaches of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh since the start of 2020. The Marco Polo and the Magellan were sold at auction in November after their owners Cruise and Maritime Voyages went into administration. The Marco Polo was built in the 1960s and was one of the world's last surviving ocean cruise liners. It was scheduled to take UK passengers to the Amazon and Norway this year, but its final voyage was to Alang in India. The ship-breaking yards of Alang dominate a stretch of muddy beach just up the coast from Mumbai in north-west India, referred to as the world's largest ship graveyard. The ship was bought at auction for around Â£2m by offshore company Highseas Ltd. After the sale, it was released from UK waters on the condition it would be used for ""further trading"". HighSeas Ltd said the cruise ship would be used as a floating hotel in Dubai. But two months after taking ownership of the Marco Polo, it was sold as scrap for around Â£4m. HighSeas Ltd director Rishi Arggawal said it was always their intention the Marco Polo would be sold to new owners ""but regrettably, the intended buyers in Dubai refused to take delivery"". Mr Arggawal said they tried to find new work for the Marco Polo as a cruise ship or a hotel without success, before selling to ""Indian interests"". It is a similar story for the Magellan, which was meant to be used as a floating hotel in Liverpool for the 2021 Grand National. It was bought at the auction by a Greek ship owner. Brokers say it was sold on for scrap after no new buyer was found. The cruise ship industry do send old ships to be scrapped safely at EU-approved yards, but when sold at auction, which often happens when a company goes into administration, this decision is taken out of the previous owner's hands. There are serious concerns about the environmental impact and working conditions in the ship-breaking industry across south Asia. Each year around 800 ships come to the end of their lives and need to be broken apart and recycled. Although this work can be carried out in the UK and other EU-approved ship-breaking yards, around 70% of the world's ships end up on the beaches of India, Pakistan and Bangladesh as these yards offer much higher prices for scrap steel. Uncovering the oil industry's dirty secret The organisation Ship-breaking Platform has documented the deaths of more than 400 workers on these beaches since 2009. It has recorded fatal accidents in the yards from workers falling from height and being killed in gas explosions, as well as longer-term sickness from exposure to toxic materials such as asbestos. There are serious concerns about the environmental impact of the ship-breaking industry across south Asia Ship-breaking Platform's director, Ingvild Jenssen, said despite laws in place making it illegal for developed countries like the UK to send hazardous waste such as old ships to developing countries, they continue to arrive ""There is a lot of value in these vessels because they contain large amounts of steel,"" she said. ""But they also contain large amounts of hazardous materials: asbestos; heavy metals; lead, and many materials you need to take large precautions when you're dealing with them."" Ship recycling consultant Merijn Hougee from Sea2Cradle says asbestos is not treated as a hazardous material in India. ""If you have a vessel built in the 60s, it is likely there are larger amounts of asbestos on board. There's a ban on asbestos in Europe, but in India, it's freely being traded and sold and used as second-hand building materials."" A ship-breaking worker in India who spoke to the BBC said they ""pump waste, like oil and petrol, into the sea when clearing out a ship, or we use it to burn other materials on the shore"". He said he has been badly burned on two occasions and did not receive sick pay while recovering. Once he had to be driven an hour away to hospital as the one near the yards did not have the facilities to deal with serious injuries. UK shadow environment secretary Luke Pollard believes tighter, global regulation is needed to ensure that British-owned ships end up being recycled by approved ship-breaking yards. ""I don't think the public want to see ships that were owned by British companies polluting beaches all around the world. I think they want to see them properly disposed of, properly recycled."" The UK government said: ""The illegal export of waste is a significant threat to the global environment, and those convicted could face two years in prison or an unlimited fine.""

Taylor Swift calls out Netflix over 'sexist joke',"Taylor Swift took to Twitter to criticise Ginny and Georgia, calling its joke about her ""deeply sexist"" Taylor Swift has accused a Netflix show of ""degrading"" women for featuring a joke she branded ""deeply sexist"". The pop star tweeted to criticise the joke, which was in the season finale of comedy-drama Ginny and Georgia. In one scene, main characters Ginny Miller and her mother Georgia argued about relationships. Asked whether she had broken up with her boyfriend, Ginny said: ""What do you care? You go through men faster than Taylor Swift."" The line incurred the wrath of Swift's fans, prompting criticism of the show and its cast members on social media. Some Swift fans even called for a boycott of the series. On Monday, Swift herself addressed the controversy in a tweet, writing: ""Hey Ginny & Georgia, 2010 called and it wants its lazy, deeply sexist joke back."" Allow Twitter content?

"Starmer's Labour critics become increasingly vocalThe Labour leader is not being strident enough in opposition, two ex-shadow ministers say.","Nearly a year after Sir Keir Starmer became Labour leader, he is being accused of not listening to grassroots activists and not being strident enough in opposition. The focus of the discontent is his reluctance to call for an increase in corporation tax amidst the coronavirus pandemic. Those on the party's left are now publicly critical, but some current shadow ministers are privately worrying whether the party's positioning on the issue is right. Ian Lavery and Jon Trickett were shadow ministers under Jeremy Corbyn. They share Sir Keir's call for any council tax increases to be scrapped. But in a document to be published on Tuesday morning, they argue that corporation tax hits the profits of big businesses, rather than hard-pressed families. PM 'no doubt' of strong jobs recovery from Covid-19 Starmer sets out to make public finances a team sport Under the radar: Labour's search for direction And in a pre-Budget speech on Monday, another former shadow cabinet member, Richard Burgon, declared that unless Labour is bolder, it could be outflanked on business taxes by the Conservatives. Now one thing that unites all three former shadow ministers was their dismissal from the frontbench when Sir Keir assumed the leadership. The left of the party have been increasingly critical of Sir Keir - especially over the suspension of former leader Jeremy Corbyn. But they are now becoming more vocal on policy and positioning rather than personalities. There are now concerns that as the country emerges from the pandemic, some of the radical policies on which Sir Keir was elected by his membership - including increasing taxes on the better off - will be diluted. Some of those who know the Labour leader well suggest that these concerns are misplaced. The shadow chancellor, Anneliese Dodds, has signalled that Labour is open to increasing taxes on business in future. More immediately, the relatively new Labour leadership want to prove their pro-business credentials and to give a clear, unmuddied message that securing the recovery is the party's priority. Mr Lavery and Mr Trickett say they have consulted more than 1,000 activists and are giving the grassroots a voice. Support for wealth taxes runs strong amongst Labour supporters, they say, and the leadership needs to hear those views rather than make policy behind closed doors. But supporters of Sir Keir are sceptical that a sample of opinion selected by his critics is representative of the views of the wider membership. On Tuesday, Exeter MP Ben Bradshaw tweeted that Labour MPs had supported Sir Keir's stance at a meeting of the parliamentary party. Allow Twitter content?

LiveLiveHunt continues for Brazil variant case in EnglandLess than a minute ago,"The search for the sixth person infected with the Brazil variant has narrowed to 379 households in the south east of England, Matt Hancock says The batch of home testing kits in question has been identified and each household is being contacted, he tells MPs The person is one of six cases of the P.1 variant found in the UK in February A further 343 people have died with Covid-19 in the UK, daily figures show - down from 548 on Tuesday All secondary school pupils in Scotland to return to classrooms part-time from 15 March Northern Ireland leaders agree five-step plan to ease local lockdown - but without timetable France will now give people between 65 and 74 the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, in a change to policy Top US official warns of 'potential fourth surge of cases' as variants start to spread Edited by Paul Gribben and Claire Heald The person infected with the Brazil variant who has not been traced used a home testing kit but did not complete their contact details, according to the health secretary Here's what you need to know this evening:  Our live page today was brought to you by Marie Jackson, Paul Gribben, Ella Wills, Jennifer Meierhans, Robert Greenall, David Gritten, Sarah Collerton and Claire Heald. Join us for more coverage tomorrow. Here's a recap of some of the latest stories from around the world: The UK government's global travel taskforce has met for the first time to start planning the UK's return to foreign travel. Transport Secretary Grant Shapps held a meeting with government departments, travel firms, transport operators and industry bodies. Boris Johnson announced last month that foreign leisure travel for people in England could be permitted from May 17 at the earliest. This is dependant on various factors related to the coronavirus pandemic, such as vaccine rollouts and the prevalence of Covid-19 variants. The taskforce will give a report to the prime minister on April 12 setting out recommendations for how and when overseas trips could resume.  Shapps says: ""The UK's leading vaccine rollout has created a wave of optimism and, as a result, the global travel taskforce is charged with exploring safe and secure ways to restart international travel when the time is right."" He added: ""We will not only consider the progress of our world-beating domestic vaccine programme, but also need to review where destination countries have got to with both vaccine and testing capabilities."" Kerry AllenBBC Monitoring, Chinese Media Analyst China aims to deliver 560 million doses within four months China has so
far delivered more than 52.5 million Covid-19 vaccinations. If these are single
doses, that means that roughly 3-4% of the countryâs 1.4 billion population have been
inoculated. However, the
country has ambitious plans to rapidly step up its vaccination programme over
the next four months.  Today, Chinaâs top respiratory disease expert Zhong
Nanshan confirmed that Chinaâs centre for disease control and preventionhad plans to administer 40 doses per 100 people by the end of June,external. It was perhaps
to be expected that China had plans to imminently accelerate its domestic
vaccine drive, given that it alreadyhas the capacity to produce at least one billion doses,externaland is increasinglyrolling out vaccine aid overseas - to at least 53 developing countries,external. Chinaâs had
some practice at rolling out medical care to huge populations. It showed last
year that it had the capacity to mass-test entire cities with millions of
residents for Covid-19 within days. In October,it took just five days to test nine million residents across the eastern city of Qingdao. Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Sex workers have gathered outside the Dutch parliament, in protest at not being allowed to return to work when other contact professions can reopen for business on Wednesday. ""Sex work is work"" and ""no stigma"" are among the words written on the banners brandished by women dressed in red. All contact professionals - hairdressers, beauticians, tattoo artists  - can start seeing clients again from 3 March but sex workers can't. This might not strike you as surprising - in many countries these trades are considered entirely different - but here in the Netherlands they usually enjoy equal status.
Prostitution was legalised more than two decades ago. Sex workers pay taxes, the industry is tightly regulated.   But sex work is still considered too risky during the pandemic.
So they have brought their peep show to parliament along with a plea, to be allowed to get back to business. Iraq received 50,000 Sinopharm vaccines donated by China on Monday Iraq has begun its Covid-19 vaccination programme, as the
country struggles to contain a new spike in infections ahead of a historic
visit by Pope Francis. Front-line health workers were among the first people to
be vaccinated on Tuesday, a day after the arrival of 50,000 Sinopharm vaccines
donated by China. The government says it has ordered another two million doses
from Sinopharm to help protect the population of 40 million. It will also
receive at least two million Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccines via the global Covax
scheme, while the World Bank has reportedly agreed to fund 1.5 million doses from
Pfizer-BioNTech. Iraq is battling a second wave of its epidemic. It reported
more than 4,600 new cases and 30 deaths on Tuesday, only six weeks after the daily
figures fell to 596 and three respectively. The government has imposed 24-hour curfews on Fridays,
Saturdays and Sundays to combat the surge, but huge crowds are still expected
to turn out to greet Pope Francis this weekend. The Pope, who has been vaccinated, chose Iraq for his
first international trip since the start of the pandemic despite his
predecessor Benedict XVI and others warning of the health and security risks. Marianna SpringDisinformation and social media reporter Twitter has
announced it plans toban users who repeatedly
tweet harmful misinformationabout Covid-19 vaccines. Under the scheme, members will face a lock being placed on their
account and if they accrue ""five strikes"", they face a permanent
ban. Twitter has said it will also start labelling
misleading tweets about the jab. Since the beginning of the pandemic - almost 12 months ago -
conspiracy influencers have grown huge followings on social media by repeatedly
sharing falsehoods about vaccines. I investigated the boom in the following of accounts promoting
anti-vaccine content on Twitter forBBC Panorama-
exposing the harm it had caused to communities across the UK. Vulnerable people I interviewed were scared off the vaccines by
the latest tactics of a committed minority of activists, who use Twitter and
other platforms. Twitter has repeatedly committed to tackling harmful misinformation
- but it will take some time to see whether this updated strike system results
in those repeat offenders having their accounts removed. While many of those influencers sharing vaccine mistruths in the
UK have already been suspended from the site, accounts of those in the US -
central to the disinformation ecosystem that repeatedly distorts stories about
the vaccine - remain live at this time. Forced cremations have prompted anger in minority communities Sri Lanka has chosen a remote island where the country's minority Christian and Muslim communities can bury their dead, following a row about the cremation of Covid victims. The government said Iranathivu island in the Gulf of Mannar northwest of the mainland had been chosen because it was thinly populated. The minorities had previously been forced to cremate their dead in line with the practice of the majority Buddhists, but the government backed down last week in the face of vehement criticism from rights groups. Muslims were angered by the ban, introduced last April, saying there was no scientific basis to claims that burials contaminated the groundwater. Muslims make up nearly 10% of the population. However, the head of the Sri Lanka Muslim Congress,Rauff Hakeem, also criticised the latest move, saying it was ""pathetic racism"",external. Read more here One BBC reporter, Juliana
Gragnani, was on a flight arriving to Heathrow around the same time as the other
flight into London from Brazil, which has been the focus of some of Public
Health England's investigations as they try to trace the Brazil variant. She talked abouttravellersâ experiences at the time, here. Now, Juliana tells us how she has
been sent a kit to test for Covid, along with other passengers on her
flight: ""I had to travel last year to Brazil due to urgent family
matters. I quarantined before I returned, took a test, and flew back to the UK,
arriving in Heathrow on February 10th, via Paris. Both flights were packed. I
interviewed a few people who told me they were returning hastily before the
hotel quarantine was put in place. My flight, AF1580, arrived around the same
time as the SÃ£o Paulo-Zurich-London flight, where the case from Gloucestershire
was traced back to. Border control was very busy. Passengers from different
flights, including at least one from Italy, another from India, and both from
Brazil (via Paris and Zurich) were in a queue for three hours with no social
distancing. After quarantining for more than two weeks (just to make
sure), this afternoon I got a call from Test and Trace. Theyâre sending me a Covid kit and said this is being done with all passengers in my flight -
AF1580. They also asked if I had taken a test after arriving in England. Walk-in surge testing at The Mall in Cribbs Causeway after two cases of the Brazil variant were identified in South Gloucestershire There's been lots of discussion around the UK's discovery of six cases of a new coronavirus variant first discovered in Brazil - so here's where we are: Please save the date, says Hannah Ingram-Moore, who is organising a celebration of the life of her father, Captain Sir Tom Moore, on 30 April, which would have been his 101st birthday. At a private funeral over the weekend, she described her father, who raised almost Â£33m for NHS charities by walking laps of his garden,as ""a beacon of light and hope to the world"". Now she's planning an event through the Captain Tom Foundation for people all around the world to ""celebrate his generosity of spirit, the hope and joy he brought to millions and his sense of fun"". In a statement,externalposted on Twitter, she thanked people for their ""continuing support and compassion"" shown to her family over the past few weeks. ""On Saturday we were able to give my father a fitting send-off adhering to his wishes in every way,"" she wrote. ""We played music he loved, spoke words that filled us with joy and the addition of full military honours would have had him bursting with pride.""

Only a quarter of AstraZeneca doses delivered to France have been used Earlier we reported that France had revised its stance on the Oxford AstraZeneca vaccine, allowing it for some people over the age of 65. President Emmanuel Macron has also said he would happily receive the jab if offered it. And yet just a month ago Mr Macron said the vaccine was ""almost ineffective"" in the over-65s, while his Europe minister was accusing the UK of taking ""massive risks"" by depending too heavily on it. So what has changed? Have the French now seen the limits of criticising AstraZeneca and come to understand that there can be no such thing as too many vaccines? Or have the UK's accusations of French vaccine nationalism been wide of the mark? As the BBC's Hugh Schofield reports, it's probably a mixture of the two. Artists from 41 countries will
appear live at Eurovision, organisers have told theBBCâs Newscast podcast. The contest's Martin Osterdahl says the performances were considered ""necessary travel"". But delegations will be limited to 20 people, down from an average of 38 in normal times, he says. He hopes there will be a live audience - but the decision has not been made yet. ""It makes a huge difference to the atmosphere of the broadcast if we have
some people present,"" he says. But if artists get âdouze pointsâ,
theyâll need to reconsider the usual exuberant celebrations. âWe want to avoid that people
start hugging and kissing each other in spouts of happiness,â says Osterdahl. Commentators like the BBCâs
Graham Norton will broadcast from ventilated commentary booths. âI certainly hope [Norton] will be
able to come,"" says Osterdahl. ""I did have the pleasure of running into him in Stockholm when I
produced the show and heâs always a very welcome visitor to the contest.â Reality Check This video can not be played Coronavirus: False vaccine claims debunked As coronavirus vaccines are distributed across the world, misleading claims about them are also spreading. There are concerns that false information shared online is fuelling hesitancy among some people about taking the vaccine. BBC Reality Check's Jack Goodman looks at five viral claims and explains why they're wrong. This video can not be played What does Covid testing in schools look like? Secondary school pupils will take a Covid test before returning to the classroom on 8 March. Children of key workers have been at school since January so they've been key in helping schools prepare for mass testing. They've been showing our social affairs correspondent Fiona Lamdin how it's done. Maddy SavageBBC News, Stockholm It looks like weâre
heading towards a third wave, is the message Swedenâs top state epidemiologist
Anders Tegnell delivered at the Swedish public health agencyâs latest news
conference. The agencyâs data suggest that the number of people being
hospitalised with Covid-19 is on the rise and there are concerns about the pace
at which the UK variant of Covid-19 is spreading. Sweden has never had a lockdown but has toughened its approach in recent
months, for example closing bars and restaurants early, and limiting organised
public gatherings to a maximum of eight people. Now, Tegnell has proposed that
from 6 March a maximum of 500 people should be allowed inside shopping malls
and large stores, a move that is expected to be approved by the government. There are already rules in place that require stores to ensure at least 10
square metres of space per customer, but there have been concerns
about overcrowding in shopping centres during recent school holidays. As we've been mentioning today, Chancellor Rishi Sunak will deliver the Budget tomorrow. Ahead of the speech, Sunak has promised:  So, what else you should be looking out for? We break downwhat might be included here, including more support for jobs and workers, a stamp duty holiday extension, and the question of whether the chancellor will extend the business rates holiday. And here iswhat we know already. Former prime minister David Cameron has received a Covid vaccination. He shared a photo of himself getting the jabon Twitter,externaland urged others to do the same. ""It's crucial we look after ourselves and each other,"" he wrote. Surge testing at The Mall in Cribbs Causeway, one of two sites in South Gloucestershire The search for an individual in the UK infected with the Brazil variant hasnarrowed to 379 households in south-east England, says the health secretary. It is one of six cases of the P.1 variant found in the UK in February. But what do we know about the other five cases?  There are concerns that the variant first identified in Brazil could spread more easily and vaccines have not yet been tested on it.Read more about it here. A man has claimed he was strip-searched in police custody after officers arrested him on suspicion of breaching Covid rules with a trip to the beach. On Sunday, Radek Kotlarek, 39, from Rhos-on-Sea, Conwy, drove more than 20 miles to the beauty spot of Talacre in Flintshire, with his wife and teenage son. He said it was for a ""mental break"" as the couple were concerned their son was struggling in lockdown and affected by the separation from sick family members in Poland. North Wales Police said officers arrested Mr Kotlarek after he refused to give his name when they suspected he had breached regulations. He was released without charge and has not been given a fixed penalty notice. Allegations that Mr Kotlarek was strip-searched while in custody were put to the force, but it did not respond. Wales' lockdown rules state all exercise must start from home and travel must only be for essential reasons. Read thefull story here. Â© 2025 BBC.

Tourism hotspots hit hardest by Covid jobs crisis,"Parts of the UK reliant on tourism have been most affected by the Covid-19 jobs crisis, analysis suggests. In some areas, around three out of five people who began claiming universal credit at the outset of the pandemic were still doing so six months later. Experts said areas with seasonal employment were more likely to see furloughed workers, those in low-wage jobs or on zero-hours contracts. The government said it was boosting welfare support by ""billions"" to help. Ahead of Wednesday's Budget, Chancellor Rishi Sunakhas promised more support for the economyas Covid lockdown rules are eased. Analysing official data from the Department for Work and Pensions (DWP), the BBC Shared Data Unit found: About 2.4 million fresh universal credit (UC)  claims began last April and May during the first lockdown - a seven-fold increase on the number made in the same two months in 2019 At least three in every five of those claims - around 1.4 million - remained open six months later Areas with the highest proportion of claims open six months later includeLondon,north and west Wales,north-east Yorkshire,Scotlandand parts ofCumbria In Northern Ireland, the number of UC claimants rose from 86,000 in March 2020 to 132,000 in August, according to separate data from its Department for Communities. ""The general consistent pattern is places that rely on people travelling to them have been the hardest hit,"" Nye Cominetti, senior economist at the Resolution Foundation think-tank, said. Economist Emma Congreve, from the Fraser of Allander Institute at the University of Strathclyde, said: ""The pandemic has exposed a number of underlying inequalities in the labour market."" Snowdonia National Park attracts millions of visitors every year Some 7.8 million people a year choose to visit the mountains, woodlands and rivers of Gwynedd in north Wales and explore Snowdonia National Park. The tourism industry employs 18,000 people and contributes Â£1.3bn to the local economy every year. But the pandemic has exposed an over-dependence on tourism, a report to the local council warns, with a 60% drop in the value of tourism in 2020. Council leader Councillor Dyfrig Siencyn told a meeting such ""unsustainable tourism"" could not continue to be accommodated. He said: ""Setting a new direction is vital and I believe that the industry itself sees the need to be more reflective of our society generally ""The pandemic has perhaps shown we're almost wholly reliant on tourism in rural areas such as Gwynedd and have very little choice, which drives us to create a much more varied economy rather than all our eggs being in one basket. ""We're told that Â£1.3bn is generated from tourism yet still have some of the lowest income levels in the country, how do you reconcile that? Central London including the South Bank has seen a huge drop in visitor numbers The tourism industry accounts for one in seven jobs in the capital and contributes almost 12% of London's GDP. London Mayor Sadiq Khan has called for the tourism sector in the capital to be given more support, withtourism spending in London set to fall by Â£10.9bn. Richard Burge, chief executive of London Chamber of Commerce and Industry, said businesses in the capital had ""suffered the perfect storm of losing revenue usually provided by international and domestic visitors, commuters, and business travellers"". Father-of-fourBrahim Rabi, 50, from Barnet in north London, was made redundant from his job as a driver for a kitchen design company in May last year. As he is looking after his four young children on his own, he can only take on a part-time job. But despite sending out close to 30 applications each week, he has not been able to find employment and has been claiming universal credit for nearly six months. Brahim's rent went up by Â£100 last year, meaning he now pays Â£1,300 a month. His benefits do not cover his rent each month and he has been borrowing money from friends and family to see his family through the crisis after his savings ran out. ""It has been very very hard, especially with the kids off school. ""I am at home 24 hours with them, thinking about whether I will have money the next day, wondering what will happen to me. ""It's the first time in my life I have been out of work. I have always had enough, I have always looked after my family. It makes me so sad, every time my children need something I don't know how to explain to them I don't have the money, it has been really hard for me. ""If I apply for 100 jobs you may hear back from one or two that reply just to say ""sorry"". The rest, you never get any reply from them. During the last year, it has been very difficult to get a job unless you know someone - all business has closed because of Covid-19."" From February last year to October, the proportion of people claiming UC whilst in employment rose on average by four percentage points. In four areas, more than half of all claimants were in employment: the Isles of Scilly, South Lakeland in Cumbria, Richmondshire in North Yorkshire, and Boston in Lincolnshire. Richmondshire's district council said it was ""a reflection of its low wage economy, with a lot of people working in seasonal tourist-related employment"". Peter Matejic, from anti-poverty charity the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, said the government would need to look ""geographically at which areas were bouncing back quicker and which sectors"" and ""think about how it can unwind the furlough scheme without bringing about a big spike in unemployment"". Minesh Patel, of Citizens Advice UK, said seven in every 10 people approaching the charity had not needed to apply for benefits before. Covid-19 meant ""overnight, loads of people lost their job or saw a drop in their hours,"" Mr Patel said. ""Our advisers are telling us a lot of the people coming to us are on the furlough scheme and need universal credit to top up. There has also been a rise in people in insecure work during this pandemic."" Earlier last year Citizens Advice said it saw a spike in visits to its website after government broadcasts It is a means-tested benefit for people of a working age on low income. It is claimed by more than 5.5 million households. It can be claimed when you are in, or out, of work. The standard allowance varies from around Â£340 to just under Â£600 a month, depending on your age or whether you are single. The Department for Work and Pensions (DWP)  said UC had ""been a lifeline for millions affected by the pandemic"" and would play a ""vital role"" in the recovery of the jobs market. The DWP said some UC claims were deliberately being left open for longer during the pandemic rather than closed to avoid having to restart the claims process for people who needed urgent support suddenly. It said spending on working-age welfare in 2020 was - at over Â£100bn - set to be at its highest level on record, in real terms and as a percentage of national income and that was combined with other measures to safeguard jobs such as furlough and help for ""the lowest-paid families"" including the Â£170mCovid Winter Grant Scheme.

Chancellor set to unveil Â£400m Budget arts boost,"This video can not be played Kwarteng: Chancellor to extend furlough scheme Business support including furlough and the VAT cut for hospitality firms will continue ""while lockdown persists"", the business secretary has said. With Covid-19 restrictions set to end by June at the earliest, Kwasi Kwarteng told the BBC it was important not to ""crush"" any potential recovery. Ahead of Wednesday's Budget, Rishi Sunak said he would protect jobs using the ""full firepower"" at his disposal. But he also promised honesty about his plans to ""fix"" the public finances. He faces a potential row with some Conservative MPs if he imposes tax increases, amid warnings they could stifle economic growth. And Labour is urging him to abandon planned council tax rises in England. What is the Budget and when will it happen? Five things to look out for in the Budget The most crucial Budget for business in a generation Â£5bn fund to help High Street recover from Covid In his Budget statement, which is due to get under way at around 12.30 GMT on Wednesday, the chancellor will commit the government to doing ""whatever it takes to support the British people and businesses through this moment of crisis"". He is set to extend the Â£20-a-week top up to universal credit for six months to help struggling households, a government source told the BBC. The chancellor spoke to people who have benefitted from government schemes to support employment from the Treasury Other support is expected to include: Â£408m for museums, theatres and galleries in England to help them reopen when Covid restrictions ease Â£150m to help communities take over pubs in danger of closing Â£300m summer sports recovery package, including cash for English cricket He is also expected to set out his plans to tackle the huge hole in the government's balance sheet - caused by the high levels of borrowing and debt built up during the pandemic, and the hit to tax revenues from the closure of many sectors of the economy. ""Once we are on the way to recovery, we will need to begin fixing the public finances - and I want to be honest about our plans to do that,"" he is expected to say. The Budget won't just be about carrying on the emergency support, with a hefty dollop of Brand Sunak, with a TV press conference and sofa chat on Wednesday evening, on top of the traditional red box doorstep and green bench moments. It will also be about how he hopes to return the Tories to their more traditional trademark - being careful with the country's cash. There won't be a return to the kind of political argument over the deficit and the debate that David Cameron and George Osborne dominated in the early part of the last decade. As one Treasury minister said: ""Austerity? You just can't do it now."" Read Laura's full blog The Budget comes at a very difficult time for businesses and government finances. Official figures show the UKeconomy contracted by 9.9%last year and unemploymentrose to 5.1%in the three months to December - the worst rate since 2015. With its takings down and its spending up, the government isexpected to borrow Â£394bnduring the current financial year - the highest figure seen in peacetime. The furlough scheme,currently paying up to 80% of six million people's salaries,is scheduled to stop at the end of April. But the prime minister's ""roadmap"" for easing Covid-19 restrictions says the final legal limits on social contact and business activity will end no earlier than 21 June. This video can not be played What factors could shape Rishi Sunak's thinking in his 2021 Budget? Asked on BBC Breakfast if the job support scheme would continue, Mr Kwarteng said the chancellor had ""already indicated that we will be extending furlough"". And he told BBC Radio 4's Today programme: ""I think it's a fairly good assumption that, while lockdown persists, there will be additional support."" Mr Kwarteng said there would ""perhaps be an extension"" of the reduced - 5% - rate of VAT for the hospitality sector, also due to end in 31 March. If vaccines continued to be rolled out ""efficiently"" and the roadmap was followed, there was ""every chance that the economy can bounce back"", he argued. ""We can see strong growth at the end of 2021, and that will be the best way to deal with the growing deficit or to try and reduce it,"" Mr Kwarteng said. The chancellor will promise help to save endangered pubs Mr Sunak is reportedly planning to increase corporation tax to as much as 25%, from the current 19%, to reduce pressure on public finances. Some Conservative MPs, including former Brexit Secretary David Davis, say this would impede recovery and are warning they will resist this or any similar moves. But former Conservative leader Lord Haguewrote in the Daily Telegraph,externalthat, after 12 months of heavy public borrowing to pay for furlough and other schemes, ""at least some business and personal taxes"" would have to rise. For Labour, shadow chancellor Anneliese Dodds said now was ""not the time"" for tax rises, but has signalled the opposition could support an increase in corporation tax in the future. She has said the plannedcouncil tax rise of up to 5%in England in April should not go ahead at a time ""when people are losing jobs"". What is the Budget and when will it happen?

Â£5bn fund to help High Street recover,"A Â£5bn scheme for High Street shops and hospitality firms in England has been unveiled, with Rishi Sunak promising more support to come for the economy. Ahead of Wednesday's Budget, the chancellor said the grants, worth as much as Â£18,000 per firm, will help them reopen as England eases lockdown. It was broadly welcomed by firms but some groups said it was not enough. Despite concerns about the country's debt, Mr Sunak told the BBC's Marr show his priority was still jobs and firms. The chancellor said public finances faced ""enormous strains"" due to the pandemic. ""I want to level with people about the challenges we face,"" he said. But the new Â£5bn grant scheme would help people ""reopen their businesses"" and is ""the right thing to do now"", Mr Sunak said. Sunak pledges help in 'remaining stages' of crisis Budget 2021: The challenge facing Sunak He said it had been an ""incredibly difficult year"" for the High Street and hospitality sectors, and the grants would give them the ""support they need to get them through, get them back on their feet"". It was, he said, part of a range of support measures since the start of the pandemic and would continue. ""We went big, we went early - and there's more to come,"" he told Marr. This video can not be played Chancellor Rishi Sunak says the shock to the economy cannot be fixed overnight The chancellor has faced calls to raise taxes from some parts of the Tory party, while Labour and other Conservative MPs have opposed increases. There are newspaper reports this weekend suggesting Mr Sunak could freeze some income tax thresholds for three years and raise corporation tax. However, the chancellor would not comment on tax measures, saying more would be disclosed in the Budget. The government has so far borrowed Â£271bn this financial year - up Â£222bn on 2019-20. This has pushed the national debt to Â£2.13 trillion. Nearly 700,000 shops, restaurants, hotels, hair salons, gyms and other businesses in England, will be eligible for the so-called ""restart grants"", to be distributed directly to firms by local authorities from April. It will replace the current monthly grant system. The funding takes the total spent on direct grants to businesses during the pandemic to Â£25bn, the Treasury said. The devolved nations will receive equivalent extra funding. Non-essential shops in England, along with outdoor hospitality, will be allowed to reopen from 12 April at the earliest. What is the Budget and when will it happen? Will the vaccine be a Budget recovery blueprint? Other announcements ahead of Mr Sunak's annual economic speech on Wednesday, have included: a new government-backed mortgage guarantee schemefor home buyers with small deposits an ""elite"" visa to encourage high-skilled workers including researchers, engineers and scientists to come to the UK Â£126m for traineeships anda ""flexi-job"" apprenticeship in England and a ""world-first"" green savings bond for retail investors to help boost the UK's transition to net zero emissions. Mike Cherry, national chairman of the Federation of Small Businesses, welcomed the ""much-needed lifeline"" provided to businesses by the grants, but called for the chancellor to set out more funding ""for those that have been excluded from income support throughout this crisis"". UK Hospitality chief executive Kate Nicholls said businesses were ""crying out for the cash"" and urged the grants to be paid as soon as possible. And Helen Dickinson, of the British Retail Consortium, which represents chain stores, said the latest money was a ""vital injection of funding"" but warned it would ""only provide temporary relief"" if the business rate holiday did not continue. Other groups called for the extension of the furlough scheme and the temporary reduction in value added tax (VAT) on hospitality sales. Last year was the worst for the High Street in more than 25 years as the pandemic accelerated the move towards online shopping,with more than 180,000 jobs lostin retail alone, according to the Centre for Retail Research. Some Conservative MPs, such as former Brexit secretary David Davis, have spoken out against attempts to increase taxes. But Conservative former chancellor Lord Clarke has encouraged Mr Sunak to consider raising VAT, national insurance and income taxes in order to repair the public finances. Labour has said it opposes tax rises in the short-term and has called for a Â£20 uplift in universal credit to be kept. The party also called for more help for young people to avoid a ""lost generation scarred by unemployment"". On Sunday, economists at the respected EY Item Club said it was right for the chancellor to continue nursing the economy through recovery rather than introduce Budget measures to re-build the country's battered finances. Martin Beck, senior economic adviser to the Item Club, said: ""Despite an almost unprecedented peacetime deficit, serious action to repair the public finances can wait. The chancellor's focus should still be on supporting the economy through the pandemic and premature fiscal tightening could undermine recovery. ""With the cost of government debt still historically low, there is no evidence yet of any significant constraint on government borrowing."" EXPLAINED:What is the Budget and when will it happen?

Most crucial Budget in a generation,"There has arguably never been a moment in living memory where business and government need each other more than now. Clinging together like the passengers in the front car of a rollercoaster - this Budget is the moment the photo is snapped after the sickening plunge, grimaces fixed for the ride ahead. Business needs the government to go on another massive spending splurge to get us to the other side of lockdown. In many ways, the ""roadmap"" out of lockdown already told us the most important stuff that will be in the Budget. Furlough, the business rates holiday, additional grants and VAT deferrals and cuts for hospitality are all pretty much guaranteed to the end of June, when the government hopes firms will be able to operate with few restrictions. After that, the roles start to reverse. Westminster will need help from businesses to preserve and create millions of jobs. Companies will need incentives to invest, build, hire and train - particularly younger workers who have suffered the most and on whose economic future the success of this moment may be judged for decades. Governments can encourage, but ultimately it is businesses which create. Budget 2021: The challenges facing Rishi Sunak Mortgage guarantee to help buyers with 5% deposit BBC editors on what to expect in the Budget Increased capital allowances, the expansion of youth training programmes and subsidies like the Kickstart Scheme are all expected in a speech behind which the mantra ""jobs, jobs, jobs"" will be almost audible from the Treasury building. The tight embrace between government and business seems a long way since the concerns of business were swatted away with a four-letter ""swish"" by a prime minister who saw them as an irritant in the project of getting Brexit done. The UK is in more debt than it's been in for more than 50 years. At over Â£2 trillion, it is equivalent to 100% of its entire annual income for the first time since the early 1960s, when debt was still on a downward trajectory from spending on World War Two. By far the most powerful weapon against debt is growth: it has a doubly positive effect. It increases the denominator (the bottom number) of the debt to GDP ratio, while reducing the numerator (the top bit) by keeping the bill for benefits like Universal Credit lower. That is why the next twist on this rollercoaster ride is the most perilous. No-one really knows how many of the almost five million workers still on furlough have a job to go back to. More than anything, this Budget is about how many of them can return to, or find new, work. This video can not be played What factors could shape Rishi Sunak's thinking in his 2021 Budget? There will be some eye-catching whizzes and bangs as the government experiments with ideas like freeports, drums up extra funding for start-ups and proposes looser stock market listing rules to grow new firms and attract international investors. But sooner or later - and I suspect the emphasis will be later than recent headlines suggest - the government will need businesses help to pay off some the UK's enormous debts. Corporation tax will rise slowly. But this is perhaps a good example of how little politics figures in this Budget. The chancellor arguably has more to fear from his own backbenches than he does from a Labour party, who find themselves in the unusual position of siding with the very MPs in their opposition on tax rises on businesses - who already enjoy the lowest rates in the G8. But corporation tax is pretty small beer anyway. It contributes less than 8% of all tax collected by the government, compared with the 45% it receives from income tax and National Insurance from individuals who have - you guessed it - jobs, jobs, jobs. The government is also scared that the ""free money"" window may be closing. Ever since the financial crisis, governments have been able to borrow at close to zero rates of interest. There are signs that is changing. A 1% rise in borrowing costs will cost the government five times more than it will get by raising the corporation tax rate by 1%. That is why the government and businesses will need to hold each others' hands on a ride they really are in together. What is the Budget and when will it happen?
