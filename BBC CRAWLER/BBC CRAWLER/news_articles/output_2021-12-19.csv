Leftist Gabriel Boric wins Chile presidential race,"This video can not be played A green laser was shone at Chile president-elect Gabriel Boric as he made his victory speech on Sunday Leftist candidate Gabriel Boric has won Chile's presidential election to become the country's youngest ever leader. In what was expected to be a tight race, the 35-year-old former student protest leader defeated his far-right rival JosÃ© Antonio Kast by 10 points. Mr Boric told supporters he would look after democracy, promising curbs on Chile's neoliberal free market economy. He will lead a country that has been rocked in recent years by mass protests against inequality and corruption. Mr Boric's victory prompted celebrations on the streets of the capital Santiago, with his supporters waving flags and honking car horns. In his speech, Mr Boric said he was taking on the job with humility and a ""tremendous sense of responsibility"", vowing to ""firmly fight against the privileges of a few"". Official results gave Mr Boric 56% of the votes against Mr Kast's 44%. Mr Kast conceded defeat barely an hour-and-a-half after polls closed, and with around half of ballots counted. Both candidates offered starkly different visions for the country, and both are outsiders representing political parties that have never been in government. Jubilant supporters of Mr Boric reacted to his victory Once the most stable economy in Latin America, Chile has one of the world's largest income gaps, with 1% of the population owning 25% of the country's wealth, according to the United Nations. Mr Boric has promised to address this inequality by expanding social rights and reforming Chile's pension and healthcare systems, as well as reducing the work week from 45 to 40 hours, and boosting green investment. The president-elect also promised to block a controversial proposed mining project which he said would destroy communities and the national environment. Chile's currency, the peso, plunged to a record low against the US dollar after Mr Boric's victory. Stock markets fell by 10%, with mining stocks performing particularly badly. Investors are worried stability and profits will suffer as a result of higher taxes and tighter government regulation of business. Gabriel Boric's speech was one of inclusion, emphasising that everyone would be a protagonist in his government. And he said he would be a president for all, even those who had not voted for him. He knows that Congress is split and he has his political opponents, but he welcomed it as a chance for dialogue. This vote was deeply polarised, making Chileans decide between a man who praised the country's dictatorship and a protest leader who, his opponents said, would bring disorder and instability. But in the end Chileans voted for a new era. And a new kind of president. For many this result was a natural conclusion of the past few years. Protests exploded in 2019 with a rise in transport costs and, a year later, Chileans voted to rip-up the dictatorship-era constitution, and write a newer, more inclusive one. Now a new leader has come out of all of this. But one of Gabriel Boric's biggest challenges will be to unite the millions of Chileans who voted for the other side. Supporters responded to the victory with uncontained joy. ""I'm very excited because this is an achievement of the people,"" Andres Rodriques told Reuters news agency. ""There have been many years of abuse and we need a renovation within politics. I have a lot of faith and hope in the youth."" Patricia Alarcon said she was really happy. ""I always had faith in Boric because I think our country deserved this - we deserved freedom, integration - we deserved this result,"" she said. A former student protest leader, Mr Boric backed the mass demonstrations against inequality and alleged corruption that rocked Chile in 2019 and 2020. Conceding defeat, JosÃ© Antonio Kast said his rival ""deserves all our respect"" His rival, meanwhile, stood on a platform of law and order, pledging cuts to tax and social spending. Mr Kast also defended the legacy of Gen Pinochet, who took power in a coup and ruled the country from 1973 to 1990. Under his leadership more than 3,000 people were murdered by the state or disappeared. In a tweet,external, Mr Kast said he had called Mr Boric to congratulate him on his ""great triumph"", adding: ""From today he is the elected President of Chile and deserves all our respect and constructive collaboration"". PROFILE:From student protest leader to Chile's president ON THE GROUND:Dark past hangs over presidential run-off The country is going through huge changes after voting overwhelmingly last year to re-write Chile's Pinochet-era constitution.

Liz Truss replaces Lord Frost in post-Brexit talks,"Foreign Secretary Liz Truss will replace Lord Frost as the UK's lead negotiator with the EU in post-Brexit talks. She will retain her role as foreign minister alongside the new post leading negotiations over the Northern Ireland Protocol. It followsthe resignation of Lord Frostas Brexit minister on Saturday. MP Chris Heaton-Harris will become minister of state for Europe, Downing Street said. Mr Heaton-Harris will be replaced at the transport department by Wendy Morton, who was previously at the Foreign Office. Lord Frost resigns as Brexit minister Dorries ousted from WhatsApp group for praising PM Lord Frost's resignation letter in full Conservative MPsare split over the departure of Lord Frost, who resigned citing ""concerns about the current direction of travel"" of the government. The peer told Prime Minister Boris Johnson he had concerns over Covid policy, urging him to avoid introducing ""coercive measures"". Some Tory backbench MPs who share Lord Frost's views described his exit as a ""disaster"". But others in the party said it offered a chance to ""press the reset button"" in negotiations with the EU. Liz Truss has a lot of jobs. She's the foreign secretary, the minister for women and equalities, and now the lead negotiator with the EU on the Northern Ireland Protocol. This is a monster brief. Particularly noteworthy therefore is the appointment of her deputy, Chris Heaton-Harris - a former MEP who supported Leave in 2016. His presence may appease some Tory backbenchers who were particularly unhappy to see Lord Frost go. But will Liz Truss approach negotiations with the EU like her predecessor? It's early days but I've heard initial suggestions that there won't be a radical departure on policy. However the UK's approach, pre-Truss, was already softening in certain areas. A source close to the foreign secretary said: ""Liz and David are friends and come at things from the same direction but Liz will put her own stamp on it and do it the Liz Truss way."" But no matter how confident the foreign secretary may feel, she's inheriting a hard, and politically sensitive, task. Ms Truss campaigned for Remain ahead of the 2016 EU referendum, saying continued membership of the EU was ""in Britain's economic interest"". She has since said she would back Brexit, if another referendum were to be held. Maros Sefcovic, the EU's lead post-Brexit negotiator, said he would ""continue to co-operate with the UK in the same constructive spirit on all important tasks ahead, including the Protocol on Ireland/Northern Ireland"". The Northern Ireland Protocol has remained a sticking point since it was struck between the UK and EU in 2019, with some businesses saying it makes it more difficult to send goods to Northern Ireland from Great Britain. In a statement on Friday, Lord Frost said of recent talks over gaps between the UK and EU: ""There has been some progress, but not as much, and not as quickly as we had hoped."" Labour's Baroness Chapman said that, while she congratulated Ms Truss on her appointment, the government must ""now stop their needless posturing and work to reach an agreement"". Elizabeth Truss became foreign secretary at the last reshuffle in September - replacing Dominic Raab. Her rise to one of the great offices of state has seen her navigate a fast track through Whitehall - taking on her first government job just two years after first being elected as MP for south west Norfolk in 2010. She began in the education department, before moving to become secretary of state for environment, food and rural affairs in 2014. She was Lord Chancellor and justice secretary in 2016 - then chief secretary to the Treasury until 2019 when she became international trade secretary. In this role, Ms Truss helped the UK deliver a number of post-Brexit trade deals with countries including Japan, Australia and New Zealand. Liz Truss: Fast tracker who landed prime role Lord Frost's resignation came aftera major by-election defeatfor the Conservatives, losing the formerly safe seat of North Shropshire to the Liberal Democrats. In his resignation letter, Lord Frost spoke of disagreement with tightened coronavirus restrictions in England that saw Mr Johnson endure his biggest Commons rebellion so far.

Drakeford denies rules 'gambling' with livelihoods,"Mark Drakeford said it was ""inevitable"" there would be further restrictions for pubs and restaurants after Christmas Wales' first minister has denied ""gambling"" with the livelihoods of nightclub staff in dealing with the Omicron coronavirus variant. Nightclubs are set to close from 27 December, but Mark Drakeford was not able to say whether there would be government support to pay staff wages. He repeated his call for the UK government to restart thefurlough scheme, which cost almost Â£70bn. But Welsh Tories called on ministers to fund it from Welsh government reserves. Meanwhile, on Sunday evening the UK government announced the Welsh government would get Â£270m, on top of its autumn budget funding, to tackle Covid. Chancellor Rishi Sunak made the announcement following discussions with the three devolved administrations, to ensure they could ""take the Covid precautions they feel are necessary to keep people safe"". Q&A: What are the new Covid rules for Wales? Nightclubs and restaurants fear New Year losses Mr Drakeford had earlier said it was ""inevitable"" there would be further restrictions for pubs and restaurants after Christmas. Speaking on theBBC Politics Walesprogramme, the first minister suggested table service and compulsory contact tracing could return. He also said a limit on the number of people from different households that can meet was possible but ""there are measures that you can take before you get to that"". The Welsh government has agreed to makeÂ£60m available for firmsaffected by the new restrictions. Ministers will also meet on Monday to decide whether to introducerestrictions for sporting eventsscheduled to take place during the festive period, including regional rugby derbies and football matches. ""We're getting fresh advice from our public health experts as to whether or not it's still safe to go ahead with those matches,"" he said. He added it was possible the games could go ahead with reduced attendance or no spectators at all. ""The festive period for retailers is absolutely critical,"" said Sara Jones, head of the Welsh Retail Consortium Samantha Dabb, manager of Newport bar and music venue Le Public Space bar, said the business could not continue to pay staff without support if it had to remain closed. ""It's really difficult to speak to my part-time staff and say, 'I don't know if you'll be in work after Christmas'. ""'Obviously, we'll do our best to pay you as much as we can, but without furlough that can only last a few weeks before we're gone anyway'."" Sara Jones, head of the Welsh Retail Consortium, said new social distancing rules were being reintroduced ""at the very worst time of the year"". She said businesses should be compensated using some of the Â£60m set aside by Welsh government. ""The festive period for retailers is absolutely critical,"" she said. ""It's a golden quarter. It's where a fifth of all the annual sales take place."" People queue for a booster jab at Cwmbran Stadium, Torfaen, on Sunday morning Public Health Wales' Dr Giri Shankar told Politics Wales further restrictions could be needed to deal with a likely""tsunami"" of cases of the new Omicron variantin the coming weeks. From 27 December new legal restrictions will be introduced, including the closure of nightclubs and extra rules for businesses and services to protect customers and staff, such as one-way systems. With the furlough scheme having come to end in September, questions have been raised as to how nightclub staff are going to paid. Mr Drakeford said ""not all"" nightclubs in Wales would shut because many will continue to operate in the same way as pubs. But on paying staff wages, he added: ""We will look as a government to see if there's any help we can give that sector to support people who would otherwise be laid off, because the numbers are small enough at least for us to explore what we can do. ""We are certainly not gambling with anybody's livelihood. We've put Â£60m on the table. ""We will work with the sectors to see how that could be used and while the number of people who are not in work because of our decisions is relatively small, we'll look to see if there's anything we can do to help that."" Mr Drakeford added: ""The idea that there is a big stack of cash looking for something to do is, frankly, nonsensical."" Nightclubs will have to close their doors from 27 December in Wales The Welsh Conservatives have called on the Welsh government to use the Â£500m it has held in reserves to deal with Covid-19 pressures. Andrew RT Davies, leader of the Welsh Conservatives in the Welsh Parliament, said if it was a UK-wide decision to close venues, then he would advocate calling on the UK Treasury for financial support. Referring to the extra Â£270m announced by the UK government on Sunday, Mr Davies said: ""The Conservatives have consistently stepped up to the plate throughout the pandemic to help Welsh families, workers and businesses - and we've done so again. ""It's now vital Labour ministers use this money quickly to ramp up the vaccine rollout, strengthen the public health response, and help Welsh workers and businesses who are already experiencing difficulties in the wake of Omicron and need support this Christmas."" Welsh Secretary Simon Hart said: ""The UK government has provided unprecedented support to people, businesses and administrations right across the UK since the beginning of the pandemic. ""This support continues with the doubling of upfront funding available for the Welsh government to Â£270m, giving it the financial certainty it needs for its continued Covid-19 response.""

Scotland to receive an extra Â£220m from Treasury,"Treasury money will be used to help businesses and the overall Covid effort Scotland is to receive Â£220m of emergency UK government money to help tackle Covid-19. Chancellor Rishi Sunak says the sum represents a doubling of additional funding being made available. The Scottish government has made repeated calls for more funds from the Treasury as Omicron numbers rise. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon welcomed the announcement but said it appeared to be an advance on money that would have come to Scotland anyway. She told BBC Scotland: ""We think last night's [funding announcement] has delivered us some extra spending powers now, although it might have to be repaid at a later date. ""So, we are working through all of the detail of that and we will consider that in the course of the other decisions that we think about at cabinet tomorrow."" Calls for hospitality support after 'bleak Friday' Sunak to hold Omicron crisis talks with businesses Music venues warn they will close without bailout Ms Sturgeon has been pressing the Treasury for more financial support as the Covid cases continue to rise again, suggesting that she may go further with restrictions if it were possible to cushion the blow to businesses. The UK government said the emergency funding was on top of the Â£220m announced earlier in the week, taking Scotland's total allocation to Â£440m. Money has also been allocated to other devolved administrations, with the Welsh  government receiving an extra Â£270m and the Northern Ireland Executive Â£150m. Chancellor Rishi Sunak said: ""Following discussions with the devolved administrations, we are now doubling the additional funding available. ""We will continue to listen to and work with the devolved administrations in the face of this serious health crisis, to ensure we're getting the booster to people all over the UK and that people in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland are supported."" This cash advance from the Treasury should allow the Scottish government to expand their Covid support scheme for struggling businesses, including bars and restaurants. They have found Â£100m from within their own budget but acknowledge that much more will be required to compensate for the economic disruption caused by official advice to the public to cut social contact. The initial Â£220m from the Treasury is not really available for that. It is an advance of Scotland's share of cash generated by new health spending in England and will be spent on health in Scotland too. The further Â£220m is also an advance of money that will become due to Scotland as a result of extra spending in England. But this time it is based on spending that has not yet been allocated. The Treasury is under pressure to come up with a support package for hospitality in England. It may be that the Scottish and other devolved governments have just received a down payment on that. If the cash comes from spending in some other area, like health, and the Scottish government has already spent it on helping business, they cannot then replicate the health spending. In the unlikely event there is no additional spending in England, the Scottish government would have to pay the money back. Ms Sturgeon insisted that Scotland did not have ""as much financial clout as I would like us to have"". She went on: ""And it isn't just about getting amounts of money announced randomly from time-to-time. ""It's also having clarity about - not just for Scotland, but for Wales and for Northern Ireland - how, if we are taking decisions that we think are necessary to protect public health, what is the process by which we can trigger financial support the way the UK government can for England when they take these decisions."" Kate Forbes delivered the Scottish budget earlier this month Finance Secretary Kate Forbes has asked for about Â£500m of immediate extra funding from Westminster, a figure based on the monthly costs of furlough and grants. She said: ""Ultimately this is about helping businesses right now that are struggling, but also knowing that when we need more support - because none of us can absolutely for definite know how this variant is going to play out - we know that we can access additional support for businesses."" Murdo Fraser, the Scottish Conservatives' spokesman for Covid Recovery, insisted the funding was ""real, additional money that has not been previously identified or accounted for"". He told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme: ""This is not an advance. It's very disappointing that rather than welcome this essential money that's coming from the UK government, we just hear the SNP attempt to stir up more grievance. ""It is money that will be available to the Scottish government to assist the many businesses and individuals who are really suffering because of the impact that guidance issued by the Scottish government has had."" Ms Sturgeon warned on Friday that Omicron was now the dominant strain of the virus and a ""tsunami"" was beginning to hit Scotland. New guidance for shops, hospitality venues and other businesses wasintroduced on Friday, in a bid to stem the transmission of Covid. RULES:What are the restrictions in your area?

""I'm happy for British tennis as well, and that we've managed to get this award...again! ""Thanks to all the fans and voters, this year has been insane. The energy this year playing at Wimbledon in front of my home crowd, that was something I've never felt before."" Now 19 and ranked British number one, Raducanu becomes the first female tennis player to be crowned Sports Personality of the Year since Virginia Wade in 1977 - the last British woman to win a Grand Slam singles title. Andy Murray was the last tennis player to win the award, with his third coming in 2016. Raducanu is the first female to win the award since Zara Phillips, now Tindall, in 2006. Fresh from completing her A-Levels, Raducanu burst onto the scene at Wimbledon, where she was handed a wildcard into the main draw late on after making her WTA Tour debut earlier in June. Wins over impressive opposition and appearances on show courts followed as she progressed to the fourth round, and in doing so, became the youngest British woman to reach the Wimbledon last 16 in the Open era. Her dream run ended in heartbreaking fashion as she was forced to retire from her fourth-round match with breathing difficulties - but little did anyone know what was around the corner. In winning the US Open title in September with a 6-4 6-3 victory over fellow teenager Leylah Fernandez, Raducanu became: The first qualifier in the Open era to win a Grand Slam The youngest women's Grand Slam champion since Maria Sharapova at Wimbledon in 2004 The youngest Briton to win a Grand Slam title The first woman to win the US Open without dropping a set since Serena Williams in 2014 She will enter 2022 ranked 19th in the world and with a new coach, Torben Beltz.

Record low turnout in Hong Kong vote,"Almost half of the seats went to candidates picked by the pro-Beijing Election Committee Pro-Beijing candidates have claimed a victory in Hong Kong's Legislative Council (LegCo) election, as the city saw its lowest-ever voter turnout. It was the first LegCo election since China made sweeping and controversial changes to the city's electoral system. Officials argue the changes were needed to ensure stability, but critics say they weakened democracy. On Monday, Beijing also unveiled a statement outlining ""democracy with Hong Kong characteristics"". In a white paper released hours after election results were announced, China said Hong Kong was now entering a new stage of ""restored order"" as a result of these Beijing-introduced changes. Why Hong Kong's elections are so controversial What is China's 'patriot' plan for Hong Kong? How is Hong Kong run? But a group of Western nations expressed ""grave concern over the erosion of democratic elements"" in Hong Kong's electoral system. ""Since handover, candidates with diverse political views have contested elections in Hong Kong. Yesterday's election has reversed this trend,"" the foreign ministers of Australia, Canada and New Zealand, the British foreign secretary and US secretary of state said in a statement. ""These changes eliminated any political opposition."" The LegCo, Hong Kong's mini-parliament, is a powerful body that makes and amends laws in the city. One analysis by local news outlet HK01 found that 82 of the 90 seats were won by members from pro-establishment and pro-Beijing camp. Only one candidate was from a non-establishment camp, and the rest had unknown political backgrounds. Government officials had urged the city's 4.5 million registered voters to take part in the election, and had made public transport on Sunday free as well as sent out mass texts to encourage a higher turnout. But in the end only 30.2% of voters participated, amid wide apathy about the poll. One woman, an accountant in her 20s, told AFP news agency: ""My vote won't mean anything because ultimately it's Beijing's people winning."" Some activists were arrested after they had urged people to boycott the election or to leave their ballots blank as a protest. While casting a blank vote is legal, it is now against the law to incite anyone to do so, or to encourage them not to vote. People queue to vote at a polling station In March, Beijing had passed a ""patriots governing Hong Kong"" resolution that fundamentally altered LegCo. It drastically shrank the proportion of lawmakers who can be directly voted in by the people; ensured candidates had to be vetted by a separate screening committee; and gave seats to the Election Committee, a group that heavily skews pro-Beijing. Only 20 of the 90 legislative seats were directly elected by the public. Nearly half were picked by the pro-Beijing Election Committee and the rest chosen by special interest groups like business and trade - which also historically lean towards Beijing. The move was widely seen as a continuation of China's plan to tighten control over Hong Kong and push for loyalty from all levels of power, following 2019's huge pro-democracy protests. It was also the first general election since China introduced a new national security law, making it easier to punish pro-democracy protesters. Analysis by Martin Yip, BBC Chinese, Hong Kong For journalists, it has been an uneventful night at the press centre. But for the biggest pro-Beijing party, the DAB, it is a night of triumph. ""DAB sure win,"" they chanted.  The more seats they won, the louder they chanted. Just as people thought the ""non-establishment"" camp was to face a total loss, one candidate managed to win. This newbie legislator, Dik Chi-yuen, will from now on be the only opposition in this 90-seat legislature. But even he - as with all the other candidates - has been pre-approved by a separate committee and deemed to be loyal to Beijing. Then comes Beijing's white paper. It repeats a long-existing rhetoric that Britain gave Hong Kong no democracy, and the introduction of the LegCo election just a few years before the 1997 handover was nothing but a conspiracy to extend Britain's colonial control over the Chinese territory. The Communist Party of China ""designed, created, safeguarded and advanced Hong Kong's system of democracy"", it insists. Beijing now defines democracy on its own terms. The struggle for power over discourse goes on. The white paper is the second of its kind to be released by Beijing on Hong Kong's political reforms. In it, China insists that it had ""provided constant support to the [Hong Kong Special Administrative Region] in developing its democratic system"", ever since the ""one country, two systems"" principle was implemented. Under that principle, Hong Kong is promised certain democratic freedoms which no other part of mainland China has. It is enshrined in an agreement signed before Britain handed Hong Kong back to China in 1997. The UK, as well as rights groups, have accused Beijing of reneging on this principle with its recent changes to Hong Kong's laws. The white paper went on to accuse ""anti-China agitators"" of causing ""damaging social unrest"" in Hong Kong, and labelled their attempts to stage pro-democracy protests as ""a pretext."" It then asserted the electoral reforms and the national security law introduced by Beijing had paved the way in addressing ""the symptoms and root causes of the unrest"" and ""restored order"" to Hong Kong. The last white paper was released  in June 2014, three months before the Occupy protests erupted that brought downtown Hong Kong to a standstill.

LA rapper Drakeo the Ruler dies after stabbing,"The rapper had more than 1.5m monthly listeners on Spotify US rapper Drakeo the Ruler has died after being stabbed at a music festival in Los Angeles. The 28-year-old, whose real name was Darrell Caldwell, had been scheduled to perform at the Once Upon a Time in LA festival on Saturday night. His publicist confirmed his death to several US media outlets on Sunday morning. The artist was reportedly stabbed during an altercation backstage around the time he had been due to perform. Los Angeles police are investigating, but told reporters no arrests had been made as of Sunday morning. Drakeo the Ruler had more than 1.5m monthly listeners on Spotify, and collaborated with Canadian rapper Drake on the single Talk to Me. Paramedics responded to a call about a stabbing at about 20:40 local time on Saturday (04:40 GMT on Sunday). Reports say the rapper was then taken to hospital but later died from his injuries. The BBC has contacted his representatives for comment. The festival's promoter, Live Nation, confirmed that there was an ""altercation in the roadway backstage"" at the event, which was also scheduled to include performances from rappers 50 Cent and Snoop Dogg. ""Out of respect for those involved and in co-ordination with local authorities, artists and organisers decided not to move forward with remaining sets so the festival was ended an hour early,"" it said. Writing on Twitter,external, Snoop Dogg said he had been ""in my dressing room when I was informed about the incident and chose to immediately leave the festival grounds"". ""My condolences go out to the family and loved ones of Draeko the Ruler,"" he said. ""I'm praying for peace in hip-hop"". The rapper was pictured with Drake on his Instagram page earlier this year As news of Drakeo's death spread, other performers shared tributes on social media. ""Always picked my spirit up with your energy. RIP Drakeo,"" Drake wrote on his Instagram stories early on Sunday. The rapper Saweetietweeted,external: ""Man Drakeo was always hella cool and respectful. Prayers up for his family. RIP The Ruler."" Jim Jones urged his peers to stay safe. ""They know who we are cause of our fame but we don't know who they are because of our fame,""he wrote in an Instagram post,external. ""Feels like we lost a rapper every week this year. There was a time when we [were] protected in th[e] community, we were treated as super heroes. Not no more."" Known for his offbeat cadence and cryptic lyrics, Drakeo was born on 1 December 1993 in South Central Los Angeles and raised by a single mother. After spending much of his youth in correctional facilities, he was drawn to music as a way of escaping the pitfalls of street life. His first mixtape, I Am Mr Mosely, was released in 2015 and pioneered a jerky, polyrhythmic sound he called ""nervous music"". He later recorded verses for the mixtape Thank You for Using GTL over a phone while he was being held at Men's Central Jail awaiting trial in connection with the 2016 shooting death of a 24-year-old man. Drakeo was later acquitted, but prosecutors sought to retry him on conspiracy charges. He entered a plea deal and was released from prison in November 2020. In aninterview with The Ringer,externalshortly after his release, Drakeo said his aspiration was to ""get my mom and everybody that I can take care of out of poverty"". ""I've got to make sure that they'll never have to want for nothing again. I want to show people that no matter how hard the situation is, my story proves that anything is possible."" He wasted no time, issuing a mixtapes in late 2020, followed by his debut album, The Truth Huts, earlier this year. Although his music never troubled the charts, he was recognised as an innovator by his peers. In a post on Twitter, LA writer Jeff Weiss called Drakeo the ""greatest west coast artist of a generation, a legend who invented a new rap language of slippery cadences, nervous rhythms, and psychedelic slang"".

Hong Kong votes after sweeping electoral reforms,"Almost half of the seats went to candidates picked by the pro-Beijing Election Committee Pro-Beijing candidates have claimed a victory in Hong Kong's Legislative Council (LegCo) election, as the city saw its lowest-ever voter turnout.

Brownwon women's park bronze in Tokyo, making her Great Britain's youngest Olympic medallist of all time at the age of 13 years and 28 days. She had already broken Margery Hinton's 93-year record as the youngest athlete to represent Team GB at a summer Games. Brown edged out England footballer Jude Bellingham and Para-swimmer Ellie Challis to the award. ""I can't believe it, I'm so thankful,"" she said. ""I just want to make Britain proud as much as I can, and I did. ""I want to inspire the world, especially little girls, and teach them that skateboarding is for everyone. ""If you believe in yourself you can do anything."" Who were the winners at Sports Personality of the Year 2021? Brown, who has never had a professional coach and instead learns tricks from YouTube videos, also won gold in the women's skateboard park event at the Summer X Games in California in July. Her 2021 successes came just over a year after she suffered a serious accident in training that left her ""lucky to be alive"". Brown fell from a ramp, fracturing her skull, breaking her left arm and wrist and suffering lacerations to her heart and lungs.

"Calls for 'reasoned debate' over oil and gas futureBusiness leaders write an open letter to politicians, warning them against creating a ""hostile investment environment"".Scotland business","Business leaders have written a joint open letter to party leaders calling for a ""reasoned debate"" over the future of oil and gas in the UK. The call comes after plans for the controversialCambo Oil field off Shetland were put on hold. The letter says any statements calling for an end to new exploration have shaken investor confidence, placing tens of thousands of jobs at risk. It warns politicians against creating a ""hostile investment environment"". The letter, from Aberdeen & Grampian Chamber of Commerce, supported by The British Chambers of Commerce and Scottish Chambers of Commerce, has also been signed by 58 leading figures from business and civic life in Aberdeen. Cambo oil field development to be paused Jobs warning as Shell pulls out of Cambo oil field Shell pulls out of Cambo oil field development Is a new oil field climate change hypocrisy? It says the economic wellbeing of whole communities across the UK is also being put at risk. The letter adds that the statements calling for an end to new exploration ""threaten the very basis of a fair and inclusive transition at the most crucial point in our collective journey to a net-zero society"". ""A transition, by definition, is a change of state over time,"" it says. ""This is one of the most complex challenges we have faced in our history and it doesn't lend itself to a simple, 'Who's good, who's bad? Who's green, who's not?' approach. To characterise it in this way is overly simplistic. ""We must now pause and allow for a reasoned debate about our energy future to take place. At the same time, we urge politicians to reflect carefully on their public statements on oil and gas and the impact they have on investment in the industry. ""We must not create an adverse policy environment at this crucial moment in our energy transition journey."" The letter adds that by 2050, the International Energy Agency projects that global oil and gas demand will fall by 80%, but 20 million barrels per day will still be needed. ""Therefore, there is no current future scenario where there is not a requirement for some oil and gas,"" it says. ""Meantime, it continues to be required for people to travel, heat and power their homes and for the manufacture of many everyday goods."" ""This leaves us with two options; to produce this domestically, with full control over the regulatory environment in which it is extracted; or to import an increasing amount of our energy, with the heavier carbon toll that shipping it from other parts of the world carries. The latter makes little economic sense, and even less environmental sense."" Russell Borthwick, chief executive of Aberdeen & Grampian Chamber of Commerce, said: ""We have a shared interest in getting to net zero as quickly as possible, but over recent months our region has been portrayed as part of the problem rather than part of the solution. ""The reality is that the skills, people, and experience embedded in the north-east of Scotland have quietly been leading the way in moving the UK towards its net-zero targets, without any intervention from COP26. ""However, turning the North Sea into a hostile investment environment today does nothing to support that transition. In fact, it does the opposite, driving investment and tens of thousands of jobs away to other regions of the world."" He added that the energy-transition opportunity for Aberdeen could be bigger than the oil and gas industry - but to get there, strong leaders were needed who were willing to ""cut through the noise, see the big picture and get our transition steps in the right order to protect jobs, provide retraining opportunities and create new ones"". Deirdre Michie, chief executive of OGUK, which represents the UK's offshore oil and gas industry, said: ""Right now, we need oil and gas for 73% of our total energy, and so the transition to carbon neutrality will be a huge and complex task. ""We will only be able to achieve it with careful planning by policy-makers who think long-term to develop clear government policies that are then supported by all politicians working together in the national interest. "" She said that for years to come, oil and gas needed to be part of the energy mix. ""It will be far better for the nation and the environment if we source these fuels from around our shores rather than relying on even more imports,""  she added.

"Over 18s in NI can now get Covid booster jabsThe Omicron variant will hit NI ""like a tonne of bricks"", warns Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill.","Northern Ireland's Covid-19 booster vaccination programme has opened to over 18s who received their second dose at least three months ago. It comes as the chief medical officer says that Omicron could be the most dominant variant in NI by Christmas. Earlier, Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said that the Omicron variant of Covid-19 will hit Northern Ireland ""like a tonne of bricks"". She warned of up to 30,000 new cases a day in the ""worst-case scenario"". There are 1,281 confirmed Omicron cases in Northern but sources have told BBC News NI that the number is likely to be much higher. Lines were forming outside at South Lake Leisure Centre in Craigavon for vaccines Chief medical officer Prof Sir Michael McBride warned that Omicron is spreading rapidly and urged those eligible to come forward for their booster Covid-19 jab, in a bid to curb the spread of the new Omicron variant. Health trusts are operating walk-in booster vaccination clinic, with up-to-date information on each trust's social media platforms, the Department of Health said. Over 30s can currentlybook a slot online,external, while bookings are expected to be made available for people in the 18 to 29-year-old age group in the next few days. The chief medical officer said people ""need to keep making safer choices in our daily lives"" He said he understood that people are worried about ""potential effects of the booster in the run-up to Christmas"". ""My advice to them is straightforward; the potential effects of Covid are much more concerning,"" he said. ""The vast majority of reactions to the vaccines are minor and short-lived, like having a sore arm for a day."" NI records five more deaths, 2,075 new cases Your coronavirus questions answered What are Northern Ireland's Covid travel rules? Speaking earlier on theBBC's Sunday Politics programme, Ms O'Neill said added the next few weeks could be the worst and most challenging period of the pandemic. The Sinn FÃ©in minister said ministers were working ""around the clock"" with public health officials to work out what measures need to be introduced and when. But she said Stormont needed more money in order to support businesses through any potential new restrictions. Michelle O'Neill said the next few weeks had potential to be the most challenging She said the timing would be crucial and added that further information from health officials is expected on Monday which will help ministers understand the potential impact of Omicron on Northern Ireland's hospitals. However, Ms O'Neill said she expected the volume of cases to be ""overwhelming"". ""We know that we will peak in the middle of January, we know that it's going to spread very rapidly, but what we don't yet know is the impact in terms of our hospital situation.""

Booster vaccinations for the 18 to 29-year-old age group were originally to made available across Northern Ireland from Monday, withappointment bookings for the age group available from Wednesday. On Friday, ministers were warnedthere could be 11,000 Omicron variant cases each dayby the end of December in a worst-case scenario. Ms O'Neill and other ministers are meeting on Sunday, Monday and Tuesday informally, ahead of a planned executive meeting on Wednesday, when they are expected to announce details of how they plan to curb the spread of the variant. However, the deputy first minister said action could be announced earlier than Wednesday if necessary. Hospitals in Northern Ireland could be under even more pressure in January, say health officials She restated public health officials' advice that a ""significant intervention"" would be needed to mitigate against the spread of Omicron. But she said the nature, the timing and the duration of that intervention was yet to be decided by ministers. Ms O'Neill added that ""everything is on the table"" in terms of the actions that might be required. But she said there was ""a danger of moving too early"", in terms of imposing further Covid-19 restrictions. ""The public health officials' advice is to wait. We're very much being led by the health and scientific advice,"" said Ms O'Neill. In terms of financial support for businesses which may face further disruption to their trade, the deputy first minister said she was meeting Treasury staff later on Sunday to make the case for more funding. ""We need money in order to support interventions because health [officials] are telling us that the booster programme in itself isn't enough,"" she said. ""We need to be able to support businesses if we have to intervene. You cannot do this without money."" On Sunday,two more deaths with Covid-19 were recordedby the Department of Health in Northern Ireland. Earlier,the Republic of Ireland's Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan announced that more than half of new Covid-19 cases there are believed to be Omicron cases, meaning it is now the Republic's dominant variant.

Deadline looms on last day to use Spend Local card,"Requests to extend the deadline have been turned down even though some people will not receive their card on time This is the last day that Northern Ireland's Â£100 Spend Local cards can be spent even though some people who applied have yet to receive one. The scheme was set up to encourage consumer spending and help businesses badly affected by the Covid pandemic. It had been due to close at the end of November but the deadline was extended amid problems with delivering cards. More than 1.4 million people applied and last week Stormont said 10,000 cards were yet to be delivered. The deadline for spending the money on the card is midnight on Sunday. But appeals for that to be extended again have been turned down even thoughsome people will not receive their Â£100 card before the deadline. On Friday the Department for the Economy said a ""small proportion"" of cards were still in the postal system. Any money that has not been spent will be returned to the economy department. More than Â£131m has been spent at businesses in Northern Ireland as a result of the high street voucher scheme. Gordon Lyons wants people to use the full Â£100 balance on their cards Retail trade bodies have credited a boost in high street sales to the scheme, said Economy Minister Gordon Lyons. Anyone who had yet to use their card or spent the full balance on it should ""use it now"", he said. The majority of people have already used their cards, he said, but most of those who have not are young people. ""Make sure you get out there and use it or you'll lose it,"" said the minister. ""If you have any balance remaining on your card - no matter how small - go out and buy a newspaper, a coffee, a Christmas card or whatever you want."" ""Please spend your card to the limit today."" There have been several problems with the administration of the scheme, which led to delays in delivering thousands of the requested vouchers. The Department for the Economy said that anyone who had yet to receive their card would not be denied the chance to spend the money. It said it was ""closely monitoring this cohort of cards and will ensure these applicants do not miss out due to postal delays"". Most of those who have yet to spend the full balance on their card are young people It added: ""After the scheme closes, the department will take stock of the various issues people have faced and options for remedy."" Before the scheme began, the department said thecards were expected to arrive by post between seven and 10 daysafter an application was submitted.

Calls for 'reasoned debate' over oil and gas future,"Business leaders have written a joint open letter to party leaders calling for a ""reasoned debate"" over the future of oil and gas in the UK. The call comes after plans for the controversialCambo Oil field off Shetland were put on hold. The letter says any statements calling for an end to new exploration have shaken investor confidence, placing tens of thousands of jobs at risk. It warns politicians against creating a ""hostile investment environment"". The letter, from Aberdeen & Grampian Chamber of Commerce, supported by The British Chambers of Commerce and Scottish Chambers of Commerce, has also been signed by 58 leading figures from business and civic life in Aberdeen. Cambo oil field development to be paused Jobs warning as Shell pulls out of Cambo oil field Shell pulls out of Cambo oil field development Is a new oil field climate change hypocrisy? It says the economic wellbeing of whole communities across the UK is also being put at risk. The letter adds that the statements calling for an end to new exploration ""threaten the very basis of a fair and inclusive transition at the most crucial point in our collective journey to a net-zero society"". ""A transition, by definition, is a change of state over time,"" it says. ""This is one of the most complex challenges we have faced in our history and it doesn't lend itself to a simple, 'Who's good, who's bad? Who's green, who's not?' approach. To characterise it in this way is overly simplistic. ""We must now pause and allow for a reasoned debate about our energy future to take place. At the same time, we urge politicians to reflect carefully on their public statements on oil and gas and the impact they have on investment in the industry. ""We must not create an adverse policy environment at this crucial moment in our energy transition journey."" The letter adds that by 2050, the International Energy Agency projects that global oil and gas demand will fall by 80%, but 20 million barrels per day will still be needed. ""Therefore, there is no current future scenario where there is not a requirement for some oil and gas,"" it says. ""Meantime, it continues to be required for people to travel, heat and power their homes and for the manufacture of many everyday goods."" ""This leaves us with two options; to produce this domestically, with full control over the regulatory environment in which it is extracted; or to import an increasing amount of our energy, with the heavier carbon toll that shipping it from other parts of the world carries. The latter makes little economic sense, and even less environmental sense."" Russell Borthwick, chief executive of Aberdeen & Grampian Chamber of Commerce, said: ""We have a shared interest in getting to net zero as quickly as possible, but over recent months our region has been portrayed as part of the problem rather than part of the solution. ""The reality is that the skills, people, and experience embedded in the north-east of Scotland have quietly been leading the way in moving the UK towards its net-zero targets, without any intervention from COP26. ""However, turning the North Sea into a hostile investment environment today does nothing to support that transition. In fact, it does the opposite, driving investment and tens of thousands of jobs away to other regions of the world."" He added that the energy-transition opportunity for Aberdeen could be bigger than the oil and gas industry - but to get there, strong leaders were needed who were willing to ""cut through the noise, see the big picture and get our transition steps in the right order to protect jobs, provide retraining opportunities and create new ones"". Deirdre Michie, chief executive of OGUK, which represents the UK's offshore oil and gas industry, said: ""Right now, we need oil and gas for 73% of our total energy, and so the transition to carbon neutrality will be a huge and complex task. ""We will only be able to achieve it with careful planning by policy-makers who think long-term to develop clear government policies that are then supported by all politicians working together in the national interest. "" She said that for years to come, oil and gas needed to be part of the energy mix. ""It will be far better for the nation and the environment if we source these fuels from around our shores rather than relying on even more imports,""  she added.

Business alarm at prospect of more Covid measures,"Hospitality bosses say the damage for many firms will be irreparable Businesses have reacted with dismay at possible tougher Covid measures before Christmas after the health secretary said they could not be ruled out. Asked on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show if more restrictions could come this week, Sajid Javid said there were ""no guarantees"" in a pandemic. Business leaders said it would cause irreparable damage and called for fresh financial support from the government. One shop owner told the BBC hopes of any return to normality are vanishing. Mr Javid told Andrew Marr that while there remains uncertainty about the new variant, it is time to be ""more cautious"" amid the rapid spread of the virus. ""There are no guarantees in this pandemic, I don't think. At this point we just have to keep everything under review,"" the health secretary said. Modelling from scientific advisers, published on Saturday, showed that if ministers stuck to the current Plan B measures, there could be a peak of 3,000 hospital admissions in England per day. Kate Nichols, chief executive of UKHospitality, which represents many restaurants, hotels and leisure firms, said further restrictions would be devastating for the industry. ""It's better to trade, even a little bit, than be closed down altogether,"" she said. ""There are a lot of costs closing down sites and then reopening them. Having a fourth lockdown would be the final nail in the coffin for some businesses. ""The damage to consumer confidence can be irreparable. We are already seeing an impact on bookings in January, February, even Easter."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak discussed the situation with business leaders last week The owner of several inner-London gift shops, who asked not to be named, said that what meagre trade was still happening would dissolve completely. He said: ""The City is becoming more and more empty and what was a few weeks ago looking like some sort of gradual return to a degree of normality is now vanishing. ""There is also no support - we have to keep the shops open, pay rents, rates, staff costs - which are all fixed costs and yet have a dwindling customer base at a key trading period."" Chancellor to hold Omicron crisis talks with firms Firms plead for help as customers cancel bookings Hospitality 'takes Â£1bn hit' on Christmas parties The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), which has 80,000 members, said there should be no tightening of restrictions without more financial help from the Treasury. The BCC is one of several business groups that held talks with Chancellor Rishi Sunak last Thursday and Friday. Other bodies on the conference calls included the CBI, Federation of Small Business, and executives from Greene King, Nandos and Whitbread, which owns Premier Inn. BCC co-executive director Hannah Essex said: ""The chancellor has listened to our concerns and now needs to come forward with financial support measures to ensure businesses can survive through the typically quieter months ahead. ""During this crucial festive trading period, many businesses are already facing the impact of plummeting consumer confidence as a result of the current situation. ""No one wants to see further restrictions, but if they are deemed necessary to protect public health, government must simultaneously ensure commensurate support is available to affected businesses."" On Sunday, a Treasury spokesperson said ""The chancellor has spoken to a range of business and industry leaders in recent days. ""We recognise how important the festive period is for so many businesses and the government will continue to engage constructively on how it can best provide ongoing support to the businesses and sectors affected."" Also on Sunday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson faced criticism from a senior Conservative MP about the economic damage caused by the ""off the bus, on the bus"" approach. Speaking on Times Radio, Tobias Ellwood said: ""That approach needs to stop because it's damaging our economy, wearing people out and our NHS isn't able to cope. ""There needs to be better planning for the future because other variants may emerge, so the government cannot keep ""locking down and killing the economy, then trying to revive it again"".

Tories split over Brexit minister's resignation,"This video can not be played Former Brexit Minister Lord Frost refuses to answer questions from the BBC Conservative MPs are split over the resignation of Brexit Minister Lord Frost, who left his post on Saturday. The peer told Boris Johnson he had ""concerns about the current direction of travel"" of the government, including over Covid policy, urging the PM to avoid introducing ""coercive measures"". Tory backbenchers who share his views have called his exit a ""disaster"". But others in the party said it offered a chance to ""press the reset button"" in negotiations with the EU. Lord Frost's departure comes days after the PM facedthe largest rebellion of his premiershipfrom his own backbenches over measures to limit the spread of the new Omicron variant. But it also comes as concerns about the Covid variant continue to grow, with the UK recording days of record cases. On Sunday 82,886 cases were recorded, and more than 12,000 new Omicron infections confirmed. Scientific advisers have also warned England's hospital admissionscould reach 3,000 a day without further restrictions. Lord Frost resigns as Brexit minister Dorries ousted from WhatsApp group for praising PM No guarantees on new Covid restrictions - Javid Health Secretary Sajid Javid told the BBC's Andrew Marr programme that while he disagreed with his views, Lord Frost had ""resigned out of principle... and we have to respect that"". But Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said the resignation suggested the government was ""in total chaos right when the country faces an uncertain few weeks"". Ministers received a briefing on the latest Covid data on Saturday afternoon and a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee is expected to take place at 17:00 GMT. Mr Javid warnedthere were ""no guarantees""on whether further restrictions would be brought in. Tory MPs have been reacting to Lord Frost's departure in public and in private, with some of the 100 rebels who voted against the additional Covid measures that passed through the Commons earlier this week -including the use of Covid passports for some venues- saying the resignation should act as a warning to Mr Johnson. Posting in a WhatsApp group, some said Lord Frost represented their views and him leaving was a ""hammer blow"" for Mr Johnson. But when Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries came to the PM's defence - calling him a ""hero"" and asking for ""a bit of loyalty"" - they removed her from the group, with leading Brexiteer Steve Baker posting: ""Enough is enough"". Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said the PM was ""running out of time and out of friends to deliver on the promises and discipline of a true Conservative government"". He added: ""Lord Frost has made it clear, 100 Conservative backbenchers have made it clear, but most importantly so did the people of North Shropshire."" This video can not be played 'A great loss' - Watch Tory MP Pete Bone describe how Conservative colleagues reacted to Lord Frost's resignation But fellow Tory Simon Hoare, who chairs the Commons Northern Ireland select committee, said the peer was ""unsuited to the 'doing of politics'"" and ""never understood the need for personal rapport or the importance of trust"". Another Tory, Tobias Ellwood, told Times Radio Lord Frost's exit gave an opportunity to ""press the reset button with the EU"" as negotiations' continue over the Northern Ireland Protocol. The protocol, agreed by the UK and EU in 2019, allows goods to cross the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland without checks. But ithas been criticised by some businessesfor making it more difficult to send goods to Northern Ireland from Great Britain. Mr Ellwood said: ""We're still not out of the woods with the Northern Ireland Protocol and we have some rather larger decisions and challenges, which actually unite both the EU, Europe and Britain. ""As much as I think this is going to be seen as a hit for the government, [Lord Frost] was a critical character that's been with Boris Johnson from the very start when it comes to Brexit, this is a chance for us to actually... sort of move forward on our relationship with the EU."" It's easy for analysts or journalists to dial-an-EU diplomat following David Frost's resignation as Brexit minister and hear them say something ""not very complimentary"" (if we're being polite). Lord Frost's ""hardball"" manner was not appreciated in Brussels, but it was recognised as a negotiating tactic. However, it would be a mistake to believe his departure will have a massive impact on post-Brexit relations. Mistrust in the UK government will likely remain, long after Lord Frost leaves. Why? Because key EU leaders, like Germany's Angela Merkel (and her successor Olaf Scholz), France's Emmanuel Macron and the Netherlands' Mark Rutte, say they believe successive UK prime ministers - namely David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson - were dishonest with them. The oft-heard Brussels view is that UK governments tried to ""play the EU like fools"" as of setting the Brexit referendum date, with prime ministers speaking to the EU about Brexit in a more collegiate manner, then becoming far more hard-line when addressing the UK domestic audience - in particular, their own Conservative Party. As of now it depends on the decisions by Boris Johnson, and the PM that eventually follows him (whenever that may be), rather than Lord Frost's departure, whether cross-Channel relations can improve or deteriorate. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who has been a long standing critic of the agreement, said Lord Frost's resignation raised questions about the UK's approach to the Northern Ireland Protocol. He said Mr Johnson ""must now urgently decide which is more important - the protocol or the stability of the political institutions"". Northern Ireland's deputy first minister, Sinn Fein's Michelle O'Neill, said momentum was needed in negotiations to make the protocol work better. ""The North will not be collateral damage in the Tory chaos,"" she added. Lord Frost acted as the chief Brexit negotiator for the UK in 2019 in the final days of hammering out a deal, and continued talks with the EU on a trade agreement. By March 2021, he had become a member of the House of Lords and a serving minister in Mr Johnson's cabinet. But his recent focus has been on disagreements over the Northern Ireland Protocol. In his resignation, Lord Frost said the PM had been ""an outstanding leader"" and that ""Brexit is now secure"". But he raised his concerns over the government's handling of the virus, saying the country needed to ""learn to live with Covid"". Katie Perrior, who worked as an advisor to Theresa May in No 10, said the anger aimed at Mr Johnson from his own MPs would leave the former PM ""laughing her head off"" as she had ""faced this kind of problem in the past with different wings of the Conservative Party"". She told BBC Radio 4's The World This Weekend that Mr Johnson ""needs to steady the ship"" and ""assert authority quickly"" to unite the party.

Dutch enter tight lockdown over Omicron wave,"People went shopping on Saturday before the lockdown was announced The Netherlands has begun a strict lockdown over Christmas amid concerns over the Omicron coronavirus variant. Non-essential shops, bars, gyms, hairdressers and other public venues are closed until at least 14 January. Two guests per household will be allowed - four over the holidays. Prime Minister Mark Rutte said the measures were ""unavoidable"". Countries across Europe have been tightening restrictions as the heavily mutated variant spreads. The new rules in the Netherlands are the strictest to have been announced over Omicron so far. ""I stand here tonight in a sombre mood. And a lot of people watching will feel that way too,"" Mr Rutte told a news conference on Saturday. ""To sum it up in one sentence, the Netherlands will go back into lockdown from tomorrow."" Booster at least 80% effective against severe Omicron How can I tell I have Omicron? Covid map: Where are cases the highest? Under the new restrictions,,externalpeople are being urged to stay at home as much as possible. There are strict limits on the number of people who can meet. A maximum of two guests, aged 13 and over, are allowed in people's homes. This will rise to four people between 24 and 26 December, and on New Year's Eve and New Year's Day. Events are not permitted other than funerals, weekly markets selling groceries and professional sports matches with no spectators. Restaurants can continue to sell takeaway meals, and non-essential shops can offer click and collect services. Meanwhile all schools are now closed until at least 9 January. ""I can now hear the whole of the Netherlands sighing. This is exactly one week before Christmas, another Christmas that is completely different from what we would like,"" Mr Rutte said. During the lockdown, two guests per household will be allowed - four over the holidays But, he added, a failure to act now would likely lead to ""an unmanageable situation in hospitals"". Larger than life, inflatable Santas bob outside a Christmas tree stall - enticing customers into one of the few places that's allowed to keep serving under lockdown. Strangers wander down virtually silent high streets, in a wholly locked down society. Last Christmas the Dutch thought Covid would be under control by now. Window shopping students responded to the closure of bars, restaurants and all non-essential shops with frustration, and resignation. It feels like a really bad deja vu one told me. His girlfriend is finding it difficult to accept the pause in what would normally be a packed festive calendar. George, a chef in The Hague, told me he would be going into work tomorrow but only to throw away all the fresh food they were planning to serve customers during what's traditionally their busiest time of the year. The Dutch prime minister described this lockdown as an ""unavoidable"" response to Omicron. But the government's critics contend the current crisis is partly of the ministers' own making, citing what was perceived by some as a clumsy handling of the Delta strain and relatively slow rollout of the booster vaccination programme. The over-60s have only just been invited to get their extra shots. Across Europe this Christmas, coming together, is becoming harder, and riskier, than anyone would have wished. For weeks, curfews have been placed on hospitality and cultural venues in the Netherlands in an effort to limit the spread of Omicron. The Dutch National Institute for Public Health has reported more than 2.9 million coronavirus cases since the pandemic began, and over 20,000 deaths. It says the Omicron variant currently still accounts for a minority of coronavirus cases in the Netherlands, but is spreading rapidly. Officials say it is expected to become the dominant variant by the New Year. The head of the Dutch outbreak management team, Jaap van Dissel, said the new measures would ""buy time"", allowing more people to get booster shots and for the healthcare system to prepare for a possible rise in infections. This video can not be played Watch time-lapse footage showing the long Eurostar queue at London's St Pancras station on 17 December ""As a country we are best protected if as many people as possible get a booster vaccination,"" he said. More than 85% of all adults in the Netherlands have been vaccinated, but so far fewer than 9% have had the booster shot. Health Minister Hugo de Jonge said all adults would now get an invitation for a booster appointment by 7 January. Several other European countries have also announced measures designed to curb the infections. France has imposed strict travel restrictions on those entering from the UK - the hardest hit country in the region, with nearly 25,000 confirmed Omicron cases on Saturday. What are France's new rules for UK travellers? From 23:00 GMT on Sunday, Germany will also ban British tourists and business travellers from entering the country. Europe has already seen more than 89 million cases and 1.5 million Covid-related deaths, according to the latest EU figures.

coronavirus section,here. And hereâs a reminder of todayâs main UK headlines.  Weâll be ending our live coverage for today shortly but, before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main  coronavirus headlines from around the world. As we mentioned earlier, a further 82,886 Covid cases were reported across the UK yesterday. That takes the seven-day average for cases to 78,229 per day. Last week saw three consecutive record days for daily cases in the UK and that trend is expected to continue next week. Despite the high cases numbers experienced across the UK, deaths remain stable, with the seven-day average now 111. However, death statistics tend to lag about two weeks behind cases, as it takes time for an infected person to fall seriously ill. Meanwhile, 49% of the population has now received a third or booster vaccine, while 90% of people have had at least one dose. Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Larger-than-life inflatable Santas bob outside a Christmas tree stall, enticing
customers into one of the few places allowed to stay open in the Netherlands, which is now wholly locked down. The window-shopping students I met responded to the closure of bars, restaurants and all
non-essential shops with frustration and resignation. It feels like a really
bad deja vu, one told me. His girlfriend is finding it difficult to accept the
pause in what would normally be a packed festive calendar. George,
a chef in The Hague told me he will be going into work tomorrow but only to
throw away all the fresh food they were planning to serve. The
Dutch PM described this lockdown as an ""unavoidable"" response to
Omicron. But his critics point to what was perceived by some as the mismanagement of the Delta strain and
relatively slow rollout of the booster vaccination programme. The over-60s have only just been invited to get their extra shots. Across
Europe this Christmas, coming together is becoming harder, and riskier, than
anyone would have wished. An additional 12,133 confirmed cases of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 have been reported across the UK, according to the UK Health Security Agency. This brings the total confirmed cases of the variant in the UK to 37,101. However, the true number of Omicron cases is likely to be significantly higher. Allow Twitter content?

Thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets of Brussels to protest against coronavirus measures, including the need to show a Covid pass to access bars and restaurants. Covid passes are issued to people who have been vaccinated. ""We think the Covid safe ticket is discriminatory,"" one protester told Reuters news agency, adding that Belgians should not have their ""freedoms"" curtailed for refusing jabs. Police estimated that about 3,500 people attended Sunday's march. Many waved flags and carried signs reading ""I am free, you are free, we are free"" and ""no to mandatory vaccination"". Belgium has reported almost two million cases of coronavirus and 27,895 Covid-related deaths since the start of the pandemic. Northern Ireland's Covid-19 booster vaccination programme has opened to over-18s who received their second dose at least three months ago. The chief medical officer says Omicron could be the most dominant variant in NI by Christmas and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill has said it will hit the country ""like a tonne of bricks"". Health trusts are operating walk-in booster vaccination clinics, with up-to-date information on each trust's social media platforms, the Department of Health says. Over-30s can currentlybook a slot online,external, while bookings are expected to be made available for people in the 18 to 29 age group in the next few days. A further 82,886 coronavirus cases have been reported in the UK - as the more transmissible Omicron variant continues to surge around the country. That figure is down on yesterday's total, which was over 90,000, but significantly up on this time last week There have also been a further 45 deaths recorded within 28 days of a positive Covid test. Wales is likely to see a ""tsunami"" of Covid cases, according to a public health official. Current plans to tackle the Omicron variant in Wales may not be enough, a leading government adviser has said. Public Health Wales' Dr Giri Shankar saysfurther restrictions could be needed. He adds that Wales is ""likely to see a tsunami of cases"" in the coming weeks. The first minister has already said thatother restrictions could be introducedwhilenightclubs will close from 27 December. With the furlough scheme having come to end in September, questions have been raised as to how nightclub staff are going to paid. But Mark Drakefordsays: ""We will look as a government to see if there's any help we can give that sector to support people who would otherwise be laid off. ""We are certainly not gambling with anybody's livelihood. We've put Â£60m on the table."" Booster jabs given in England have hit a record high, with more than 830,000 administered on Saturday. A record 906,656 vaccine doses were given in total, including first and second jabs, NHS England said.  Of those, 830,403 were booster jabs. A rate of around one million a day is needed if every adult is to be offered a booster jab by the end of the year. You can find more details here on how to book a jab. More than half of new Covid-19 cases in the Republic of Ireland are believed to be Omicron cases, meaning it is now the Republic's dominant variant. Ireland's Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan urged people to get vaccinated and reduce their social contacts. He said it had taken less than two weeks for Omicron to become dominant in Ireland, which revealed ""just how transmissible this variant is"". A further 5,124 confirmed cases of Covid-19 were reported on Sunday. From Monday, hospitality venues, cinemas and theatres will have to close at 20:00. Read more about the new measures in Ireland,here. Football fans clashed with police ahead of a game in Rotterdam As we've been reporting here,the Netherlands has today entered a strict lockdownthat is expected to remain in force until at least mid-January. All non-essential shops are closed, as well as bars and other public venues, and only two guests are permitted per household - four over the holidays - leaving Christmas plans in disarray. In the capital, Amsterdam, streets and squares usually filled with people at this time of year shopping and socialising were noticeably quiet. In Rotterdam, hundreds of people gathered outside a football stadium ahead of a game between local team Feyenoord and rivals Ajax Amsterdam. Fireworks and bottles were thrown at police, who used water cannon to disperse the crowds. Several arrests were made. Fans have been banned from attending sporting events in the Netherlands since the end of November in an effort to limit the spread of Omicron.  Israelis are already barred from travelling to France, Ireland, Norway, Spain, Finland, and Sweden among other nations In Israel, the health ministry has recommended banning Israelis from travelling to the United States in what would be a major step. It has also recommended adding several European countries including Italy, Germany and Portugal to its red list for international travel. The UK and most of Africa is already on Israel's red list. ""European countries are either in lockdown or are heading that way,"" Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said, adding that for Israel ""time is running out"". Such measures would have to be approved by parliament. US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci says travelling increases the risk of spreading coronavirus, even among those people who are fully vaccinated. ""There's no doubt about this, [Omicron] has an extraordinary capability of spreading,"" he told NBC News' Meet the Press show on Sunday. Dr Fauci, who advises the White House on Covid, says the variant is now ""raging through the world"". ""Our hospitals, if things look like they're looking now, are going to be very stressed,"" he warns. ""The difference between a vaccinated and boosted person who has an infection, and someone who has an infection who has never been vaccinated - it's a major difference with regard to the risk of severity,"" Dr Fauci adds. More than 77% of the eligible US population has received at least one Covid vaccination, according tothe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,external. Shoppers on Princes Street in Edinburgh wore masks on the last Saturday before Christmas As we just reported, the leaders of the devolved nations are due to meet later today as concern grows over the spread of Omicron. In Scotland, senior officials are suggesting that tougher Covid restrictions could be introduced around the new year. Prof Jason Leitch, the country's national clinical director, said it was better to ""act harder"" and ""early"" while Scotland Office Minister Iain Stewart has said ""big decisions"" may need to be made. Scots are currently being advised to reduce their socialising and limit gatherings to three households. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon previously warned that Omicron was the dominant strain of the virus and a ""tsunami"" was beginning to hit Scotland. You can read more here. Cabinet Office Minister Steve Barclay will chair a meeting between the government's emergency committee, Cobra, and the leaders of the devolved nations at 17:00 GMT. Confirmation of the meeting comes shortly after the Health Security Agency announced that 12,133 additional cases of the Omicron variant had been reported across the UK. This brings the total of confirmed Omicron cases in the UK to 37,101. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Introducing
restrictions buys time, but it does not solve the problem. The
risk is you just delay the inevitable because you get a rebound in infections
once they are lifted. So
the question that has to be asked is, what will be done with the time that a
short circuit breaker would provide if it was introduced. It
would certainly allow more boosters to be given. But more than 80% of the most
vulnerable have already been boosted, so the gains from that are nowhere near what they
were for last winterâs lockdown when the vaccine programme was in its infancy. If
admissions were to rise as quickly as some of the most pessimistic modelling
suggests, restrictions could stop the NHS being overwhelmed by flattening the
peak. This
perhaps remains the strongest argument in favour of a circuit breaker given the
uncertainty for the moment over how much serious illness will be caused by this
Omicron wave. And
all of that, of course, needs to be weighed against the costs to
society, the economy and wider mental health. You can read more from Nick on what tougher measures will achieve,here. If youâre just joining us, here are the key developments so far today: As we've reported, the British Chambers of Commerce and the British Retail Consortium have been calling for more financial support from the government for hard-hit businesses. In response, the government says it will continue to ""engage constructively"" with businesses as measures to control Omicron take effect. A spokesperson for the Treasury said:
""The Chancellor has spoken to a range of business and industry leaders in recent days. ""We recognise how important the festive period is for so many businesses and the government will continue to engage constructively on how it can best provide ongoing support to the businesses and sectors affected.""

England facing defeat after Root falls,"This video can not be played Highlights: Defeat looms for England as Australia dominate Second Ashes Test, Adelaide (day four of five) Australia 473-9-dec & 230-9 decLabuschagne 51, Head 51 England 236 & 82-4Richardson 2-17 Need 386 more to win Scorecard England are facing defeat in the second Ashes Test after captain Joe Root fell in the final over of day four against Australia in Adelaide. Root edged behind off Mitchell Starc to what proved to be the last ball of the day, as England closed on 82-4. It was a bitter blow to the hopes of the tourists, who need to bat out the final day for a draw, having been set a nominal 468 to win. Root, unable to take the field at the start of the day because of injury, dug in for 67 balls for 24 and looked poised to end unbeaten alongside Ben Stokes, who is three not out from 40. England had lost opener Haseeb Hameed in the second over of their innings when he gloved a rising length ball from Jhye Richardson behind for a duck. Dawid Malan was trapped lbw for 20 by Michael Neser and Rory Burns batted for 95 balls, only to edge Richardson to second slip for 34. Earlier, despite losing three wickets for seven runs in a bizarre first session, Australia moved from 45-1 to 230-9 before declaring an hour before tea. On a turning track and with the benefit of another session under the lights possibly to come on day five, the hosts look primed to take a 2-0 series lead. Reaction to day four in Adelaide TMS podcast: Analysis of a bizarre fourth day Root puts everything on the line for England in Adelaide This video can not be played The Ashes: Joe Root dismissed as edge carries to Carey for 24 England have looked destined for defeat in the game since collapsing on day three but had Root survived the last over there would have been slim hopes that a draw could be salvaged. He has singlehandedly fought to keep England's floundering batting line-up afloat this year, scoring 1,630 runs in 2021 - a record for an England batter and more than 1,000 any of his team-mates have accumulated. But, late in the Adelaide night and with five balls of Starc's over left to survive, he pushed onto the front foot outside off stump and offered a thin edge through to Alex Carey. This video can not be played The Ashes: Root in pain after being 'struck where you don't want to be struck!' In the previous over he needed several minutes of treatment having been hit in the groin by Starc, the same place he hadtaken a blow without protectionbefore play, which required him to go to hospital for a scan. Without Root, England fans will have little faith a middle and lower order that has spent the year disintegrating repeatedly can save the game. No batter remaining in the line-up has scored 40 or lasted more than 100 balls in the series but they now must save the Test. Australia spinner Nathan Lyon is wicketless in the innings but will be a major threat on the final day, having beaten the bat again and again in the final session. This video can not be played England's Haseeb Hameed caught behind for early wicket by Jhye Richardson delivery Hameed's duck was the 13th by an England opener this calendar year, the most by any team in Test history. In fairness he got a good ball from Richardson that kicked from a length to take his glove, but it was another sorry start by England to what was a monumental task. His partner Burns has made six of those ducks, including one from the first ball of the first Test. Burns' innings on day four was more than double his previous highest score in the series so far (13) but when he poked at a ball which angled in and moved slightly away, it was snaffled at second slip by Steve Smith. Malan, a rare highlight for England in this tour with scores of 82 and 80, had already been dropped at slip by Smith off Lyon when he was pinned in front by debutant Neser from round the wicket. Starc and all-rounder Cameron Green impressed again while Richardson was much improved on the first innings. Much of the day was a strange waiting game as Australia held off declaring until light had begun to fade in the day-night Test. It began in hectic fashion when, after Root's absence became known and James Anderson bowled nightwatchman Michael Neser for three, Jos Buttler brilliantly caught Australia opener Marcus Harris for 23, diving one-handed to his left. England's wicketkeeper then dropped a far easier chance off the next ball, which would have seen Smith depart for a first-ball duck. Smith was fortunate to survive an lbw review by the slimmest margin the very next ball but he then gloved Ollie Robinson down the leg-side for six soon after - Buttler this time taking another fine catch with his left hand. This video can not be played Two brilliant catches and a drop - Buttler's dramatic session England, bowling a fuller length and producing one of their best spells of the match, conceded only 14 runs in the first hour. That said, despite being 59-4, Australia were still well in command 296 runs ahead. From there things took an even more strange turn when Robinson bowled three overs of off-spin with Root still off the field. When Root returned after 90 minutes, runs started to flow as Labuschagne and Head, who was removed by a stunning Stokes catch, pushed Australia towards their declaration - both making 51. Sparing their fast bowlers more work, England threw the ball to Malan, who looped six overs of part-time leg spin. He ended with his first two Test wickets, both catches off slogs, and Root claimed another two on a pitch that England must surely be wishing they had a front-line spinner in their side to bowl on. BBC cricket correspondent Jonathan Agnew:""This actually began as one of England's better days. ""If Joe Root had still been there at the close, they would have said it was one of their better days of the series."" Australia vice-captain Travis Head:""Root is a huge wicket, he is in fantastic form. I have a lot of sympathy for him - it wasn't a great time to get hit. ""They've still got some quality players. Nathan Lyon will play a massive part, the ball is turning."" England bowling coach Jon Lewis:""They will try to survive the day tomorrow to get ourselves out of this game with a draw. It's a big ask I know.""

Business alarm over more Covid measures,"Hospitality bosses say the damage for many firms will be irreparable Businesses have reacted with dismay at possible tougher Covid measures before Christmas after the health secretary said they could not be ruled out. Asked on the BBC's Andrew Marr Show if more restrictions could come this week, Sajid Javid said there were ""no guarantees"" in a pandemic. Business leaders said it would cause irreparable damage and called for fresh financial support from the government. One shop owner told the BBC hopes of any return to normality are vanishing. Mr Javid told Andrew Marr that while there remains uncertainty about the new variant, it is time to be ""more cautious"" amid the rapid spread of the virus. ""There are no guarantees in this pandemic, I don't think. At this point we just have to keep everything under review,"" the health secretary said. Modelling from scientific advisers, published on Saturday, showed that if ministers stuck to the current Plan B measures, there could be a peak of 3,000 hospital admissions in England per day. Kate Nichols, chief executive of UKHospitality, which represents many restaurants, hotels and leisure firms, said further restrictions would be devastating for the industry. ""It's better to trade, even a little bit, than be closed down altogether,"" she said. ""There are a lot of costs closing down sites and then reopening them. Having a fourth lockdown would be the final nail in the coffin for some businesses. ""The damage to consumer confidence can be irreparable. We are already seeing an impact on bookings in January, February, even Easter."" Chancellor Rishi Sunak discussed the situation with business leaders last week The owner of several inner-London gift shops, who asked not to be named, said that what meagre trade was still happening would dissolve completely. He said: ""The City is becoming more and more empty and what was a few weeks ago looking like some sort of gradual return to a degree of normality is now vanishing. ""There is also no support - we have to keep the shops open, pay rents, rates, staff costs - which are all fixed costs and yet have a dwindling customer base at a key trading period."" Chancellor to hold Omicron crisis talks with firms Firms plead for help as customers cancel bookings Hospitality 'takes Â£1bn hit' on Christmas parties The British Chambers of Commerce (BCC), which has 80,000 members, said there should be no tightening of restrictions without more financial help from the Treasury. The BCC is one of several business groups that held talks with Chancellor Rishi Sunak last Thursday and Friday. Other bodies on the conference calls included the CBI, Federation of Small Business, and executives from Greene King, Nandos and Whitbread, which owns Premier Inn. BCC co-executive director Hannah Essex said: ""The chancellor has listened to our concerns and now needs to come forward with financial support measures to ensure businesses can survive through the typically quieter months ahead. ""During this crucial festive trading period, many businesses are already facing the impact of plummeting consumer confidence as a result of the current situation. ""No one wants to see further restrictions, but if they are deemed necessary to protect public health, government must simultaneously ensure commensurate support is available to affected businesses."" On Sunday, a Treasury spokesperson said ""The chancellor has spoken to a range of business and industry leaders in recent days. ""We recognise how important the festive period is for so many businesses and the government will continue to engage constructively on how it can best provide ongoing support to the businesses and sectors affected."" Also on Sunday, Prime Minister Boris Johnson faced criticism from a senior Conservative MP about the economic damage caused by the ""off the bus, on the bus"" approach. Speaking on Times Radio, Tobias Ellwood said: ""That approach needs to stop because it's damaging our economy, wearing people out and our NHS isn't able to cope. ""There needs to be better planning for the future because other variants may emerge, so the government cannot keep ""locking down and killing the economy, then trying to revive it again"".

Lord Frost resigns as Brexit minister,"Brexit minister Lord Frost has resigned from the UK government over ""concerns about the current direction of travel"". In a letter to Boris Johnson, the peer, who led Brexit negotiations, said he hoped the PM would ""not be tempted"" by ""coercive measures"" to tackle Covid. Earlier this week, Mr Johnson facedthe largest rebellion of his premiershipfrom Tory MPs over measures to limit the spread of the new Omicron variant. But the UK has seen days of record cases, with 90,418 on Saturday alone. And more than 12,000 confirmed Omicron infections were reported on Sunday. Scientific advisers have also warned England's hospital admissionscould reach 3,000 a day without further restrictions. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said Lord Frost was an ""outstanding public servant"", telling the BBC's Andrew Marr programme that while he disagreed with his remarks, the minister had ""resigned out of principle... and we have to respect that"". But Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said the resignation suggested the government was ""in total chaos right when the country faces an uncertain few weeks"". Ministers received a briefing on the latest Covid data on Saturday afternoon and a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee is expected to take place at 17:00 GMT. And Mr Javid warnedthere were ""no guarantees""on whether further restrictions would be brought in. No guarantees on new Covid restrictions - Javid Lord Frost's resignation letter in full Brexit border problem: A simple guide Lord Frost's resignation also comes after amajor by-election defeatfor the Conservatives, losing the formerly safe seat of North Shropshire to the Liberal Democrats. The Mail on Sunday,which first reported the news,external, said he handed in his resignation a week ago, partly in disagreement with Covid curbs. But in his letter to the prime minister, Lord Frost said now the arrangement to exit in January had been made public, he would leave with ""immediate effect"". He wrote that Mr Johnson had been ""an outstanding leader"" during turbulence over Brexit, and the pair had a ""close common understanding"" on their aims in that area. But after saying ""Brexit is now secure"", he added: ""You know my concerns about the current direction of travel. ""I hope we will move as fast as possible to where we need to get to: a lightly regulated, low-tax, entrepreneurial economy, at the cutting edge of modern science and economic change."" Lord Frost moved on to his concerns over the government's handling of the virus, saying the country needed to ""learn to live with Covid"". ""I know that is your instinct too,"" he wrote. ""You took a brave decision in July, against considerable opposition, to open up the country again. ""Sadly it did not prove to be irreversible, as I wished, and believe you did too. ""I hope we can get back on track soon and not be tempted by the kind of coercive measures we have seen elsewhere."" In his reply, Mr Johnson did not address the critical elements of the letter, but said the now former minister should be ""immensely proud of your historic service to this government and this country"". Mr Javid told Andrew Marr that Lord Frost was ""entitled to his views,"" but added: ""My own view in terms of the direction of travel, dealing with this pandemic, which is something no-one expected when we won the last general election, but also getting on with the priorities of the British peopleâ¦ this is all a huge part of what the government is getting on with."" He said he did not want ""restrict people's freedoms"" with Covid measures, but added: ""The British people do understand this pandemic requires extraordinary actions and that's what last week was."" Asked if any further measures would be announced after reports of impending circuit breaker lockdowns ahead of Christmas, Mr Javid said: ""There are no guarantees in this pandemic. At this point we have to keep everything under review."" But the health secretary said it ""would be for parliament to decide"" if any additional restrictions came into force. Analysis by Jennifer Scott, BBC political reporter The past few weeks have been torrid for Boris Johnson. From the fallout of the Owen Paterson scandal, to Christmas parties, Tory rebellions and by-election losses, there is no doubt his authority in No 10 has wavered. So the resignation of close ally and Brexit backer Lord Frost cannot have been a welcome early Christmas present. With Omicron cases on the up and fears of what could come next, there are rumours abound that the PM will have to bring in more measures to tackle the variant. But the exit of Lord Frost has also given a certain section of rebellious backbenchers another chance to voice their frustrations with Johnson, and it seems unlikely they would support restrictions, having already rejected Plan B measures in the week. With Health Secretary Sajid Javid saying there are ""no guarantees"" around what moves the government may have to make, Johnson could again be looking to Labour votes to secure any plan he comes up with. But that will be yet another blow to an already-bruised prime minister and increase the volume of those angry MPs in his own party. MPs have had mixed reactions to Lord Frost's exit from government. But some of the 100 rebels who voted against the additional Covid measures that passed through the Commons earlier this week -including the use of Covid passports for some venues- said the resignation should act as a warning to Mr Johnson. On Saturday night, Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries was kicked out of a WhatsApp group of Tory MPs - which counts many of the rebels as members - by former Brexit minister Steve Baker, after calling for ""a bit of loyalty"" towards the prime minister. Afterwards, Mr Baker posted: ""Enough is enough."" This video can not be played 'A great loss' - Watch Tory MP Pete Bone describe how Conservative colleagues reacted to Lord Frost's resignation Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said the PM was ""running out of time and out of friends to deliver on the promises and discipline of a true Conservative government"". He added: ""Lord Frost has made it clear, 100 Conservative backbenchers have made it clear, but most importantly so did the people of North Shropshire."" But their Tory colleague Simon Hoare, who chairs the Commons Northern Ireland select committee, said the peer was ""unsuited to the 'doing of politics'"" and ""never understood the need for personal rapport or the importance of trust"". Lord Frost had most recently been engaged in negotiations with the EU over post-Brexit arrangements. This included elements of the Northern Ireland Protocol, agreed by the UK and EU in 2019, that allows goods to cross the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland without checks. The protocolhas been criticised by some businessesfor making it more difficult to send goods to Northern Ireland from Great Britain. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who has been a long standing critic of the agreement, said the resignation raised questions about the UK's approach to the protocol. He said Mr Johnson ""must now urgently decide which is more important - the protocol or the stability of the political institutions"". Northern Ireland's deputy first minister, Sinn Fein's Michelle O'Neill, said momentum was needed in negotiations to make the protocol work better. ""The North will not be collateral damage in the Tory chaos,"" she added. It's easy for analysts or journalists to dial-an-EU diplomat following David Frost's resignation as Brexit minister and hear them say something ""not very complimentary"" (if we're being polite). Lord Frost's ""hardball"" manner was not appreciated in Brussels, but it was recognised as a negotiating tactic. However, it would be a mistake to believe his departure will have a massive impact on post-Brexit relations. Mistrust in the UK government will likely remain, long after Lord Frost leaves. Why? Because key EU leaders, like Germany's Angela Merkel (and her successor Olaf Scholz), France's Emmanuel Macron and the Netherlands' Mark Rutte, say they believe successive UK prime ministers - namely David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson - were dishonest with them. The oft-heard Brussels view is that UK governments tried to ""play the EU like fools"" as of setting the Brexit referendum date, with prime ministers speaking to the EU about Brexit in a more collegiate manner, then becoming far more hard-line when addressing the UK domestic audience - in particular, their own Conservative Party. As of now depending on the decisions by Boris Johnson, and the PM that eventually follows him (whenever that may be), rather than Lord Frost's departure, whether cross-Channel relations can improve or deteriorate. This is not about reversing Brexit, or changing a hard Brexit to a soft one. It's more a question of whether or not the two sides can work better together on the Northern Ireland Protocol, wider post-Brexit trade issues, security and defence, and financial services. Brussels is pessimistic, at least in the short-term. But future EU-UK relations are about a lot more than Lord Frost. CHRISTMAS IN THE MIDDLE AGES:What were the festivities like for our ancestors?

French ski season in disarray as UK tourists banned,"Britons accounted for one in four tourists in Chamonix before the Covid pandemic The early season snow on the pine-filled slopes of Mont Blanc is the best Chamonix has seen for years. There just aren't the British skiers to enjoy it. It had looked like being a bumper Christmas for France's ski resorts, with flights and ferries from Britain fully booked. But then came a warning from France's government last Thursday of ""a landslide"" - not on its own mountains, but of the Omicron coronavirus variant careering through the UK. All non-essential travel from Britain was to be banned. And suddenly cancellations replaced arrivals. ""I feel sad, disappointed and angry,"" says Thomas Mathieu, the owner of Brasserie les Marmottons, adding he has had to lay off three employees, anticipating the drop in business. ""Everything is ready here: we put on masks, we have the [vaccination] passes, we have everything right by our government. It's very confusing for us,"" he adds. One in four tourists in Chamonix before the pandemic was British. Britons are the largest foreign cohort of visitors to the French resorts. But France's Prime Minister Jean Castex has compared Omicron to ""lightning"" - and his government appears willing to take the hit, accelerating its booster programme in the meantime. Many UK holidays to the slopes of Chamonix had to be cancelled Some from the UK arrived just before the drawbridge came up on Friday night, counting their luck as businesses count their losses. Hugh Kocheta had just skied down from 2,100 metres - the pistes wide open with so few Brits here. ""We're missing a few people from different families who were supposed to come over, but who are probably just not going to be able to come out now,"" he says. ""It's obviously a bit gutting for certain people."" What are France's new rules for UK travellers? Ports and Eurostar busy ahead of France travel ban How can I tell if I have Omicron? Alison Hands and her family were driving down from Calais on Thursday as they heard the news. ""Being here makes it feel like a normal Christmas again because I've come every year since I was born - apart from the last one,"" says her eight-year-old son Moss. And that is the fear here - that the ban on British tourists evokes a worrying dÃ©jÃ -vu of last Christmas when strict lockdowns followed. For those catering for the British market, the emptiness is devastating - and an ominous sign of what more could come. Dave Searle of the British Association of Mountain Guides in Chamonix says he's concerned about future winter seasons Dave Searle works with the British Association of Mountain Guides in Chamonix, and cancellations have flooded in. ""If this continues this season, it'll be a big loss of earningsâ¦ up to 50% of my annual earnings is through the winter. I guess I'm worried it's just going to keep doing this every winter. And if I'm losing half my earnings every year, I need to find a new profession."" Does he understand the French decision, I ask? ""It does make sense in some ways and it's all about keeping people safe and hospitals empty,"" he replies. ""But perhaps it does also feel like a bit of a kneejerk reaction, singling out one country."" France's confirmed Omicron cases are a fraction of those in the UK, though French scientists do far less genetic sequencing of new variants than their British counterparts. And intensive care units are once again filling up fast here. Beside the Christmas lights in the centre of beautiful Chamonix, festive cheer is fading. The hope is that this may be a short blip, not a lost season. France is buying time with this measure - and paying a high price for its mountain resorts to sparkle again.

Calls for hospitality support after 'bleak Friday',"Talks on further support for Scottish businesses are set to take place as firms feel the pinch on what should be their busiest weekend of the year. The UK government is due to hold a Cobra meeting including leaders of the devolved administrations, who want more money for measures to tackle Omicron. The Scottish government has already said bars and restaurants will receive a Â£66m support package. But hospitality bosses say this would not cover even a few days' losses. The sum was a share of a Â£100m package from the Scottish government's budget, which also covered the food and drink supply chain, the cultural sector and the wedding sector. Sunak to hold Omicron crisis talks with businesses Omicron now dominant virus variant in Scotland Music venues warn they will close without bailout Stephen Montgomery, of the Scottish Hospitality Group, told the BBC'sGood Morning Scotlandprogramme he had visited a number of hospitality venues on Friday night, and there was a noticeable drop in footfall. He said: ""It was a bit unreal, it was quieter than what we'd expect for what would traditionally have been 'black Friday' - which we're calling 'bleak Friday'. ""This is the time of year when we would normally take 30-35% of our annual turnover to see us through January-February time and the last reports we've had in since the Public Health Scotland message came out on Thursday of last week, we're probably seeing a big impound of turnover lost in Scotland through this."" On the Â£100m funding from the Scottish government, Mr Montgomery said the hospitality industry's share was ""a lot short"" as they had expected an 80:20 split. He said: ""It wouldn't even cover one or two days of loss of turnover for some people, it certainly wouldn't cover the wages for one week. ""We'll take it, of course we will, but there has got to be some ongoing talks between the UK and Scottish governments - put all political differences aside and get this sorted out."" The Scottish government has made repeated calls for more money from the UK government - a phone call involving Nicola Sturgeon and Boris Johnson took place on Friday. Earlier this week the Treasury announced Â£220m of immediate funding, but Scottish ministers say this had been brought forward from next year and had already been budgeted for. Finance Secretary Kate Forbes told the BBC that ""tentative"" conversations were being held with the Treasury and she was making the case for funds ""on every front"". Kate Forbes delivered the Scottish budget earlier this month before Â£100m was allocated to support businesses hit by the pandemic Ms Forbes said she has quoted Â£500m in the Scottish government's request, a figure based on the monthly costs of furlough and grants. She said: ""The UK government can make the substantial funds available almost over night because they access borrowing from the market and ultimately we need the UK government to deliver on the requests made by the Welsh and Scottish governments. ""Ultimately this is about helping businesses right now that are struggling, but also knowing that when we need more support - because none of us can absolutely for definite know how this variant is going to play out - we know that we can access additional support for businesses."" On Friday, the UK government's ChancellorRishi Sunak met business leadersfor crisis talks, as firms warned of lost bookings. Mr Sunak has said that it is ""a difficult time for the hospitality industry"" but there were existing support measures in place to help the industry. Dr Christine Tait-Burkhard - an expert in infection and immunity at Edinburgh University - told the BBC that Omicron could be slowed down but not stopped. She pointed to advice from the UK government's scientific advisory group, Sage, which said if we want to stop the spread we shouldgo back to limiting indoor hospitality and indoor meetings. She said nightclubs and other large events could be shut down after Christmas to slow the spread. Nightclubs were closed in Scotland for 16 months at the start of the pandemic andreopened in August. Dr Tait-Burkhard said: ""What we've seen with Omicron is it's very good at spreading in close-contact, large settingsâ¦ that means certain businesses such as nightclubs are indeed a really good place where the virus can spread easily. ""We have seen Wales closing down nightclubs after Christmas. It is a good potential that that might happen in Scotland as well alongside large events."" Live music venues have already warned theyrisk permanent closureif no bailout is forthcoming. On Saturday, 5,917 new cases of Covid were reported - accounting for 12.2% of PCR tests - however, Public Health Scotland said results were being reported more slowly due to the high volume of tests being taken, meaning the true number of Covid cases was likely to be higher. Nicola Sturgeon warned on Friday that Omicron was now the dominant strain of the virus and a ""tsunami"" was beginning to hit Scotland. New guidance for shops, hospitality venues and other businesses wasintroduced on Friday, in a bid to stem the transmission of Covid. David Lonsdale, director of the Scottish Retail Consortium, said there were ""early and worrying indications to suggest shopper footfall has plunged even further in Scotland's city centre locations over recent days"" following the first minister's advice for the public to stay at home as much as possible. He said it was a ""crucial"" trading time for shops, and that if the further downturn persisted then the government should be prepared to support the retail sector with further financial aid. ""The sector provides 230,000 jobs directly in Scotland and is vital to the health of our high streets and city centres,"" he added. On Saturday, Braehead shopping centre in Renfrewshire said the malls had been ""busy"", with ""a stream of socially-distanced shoppers"" taking advantage of the last weekend to shop before Christmas.

Millennium Dome architect Richard Rogers dies,"This video can not be played Watch: Highlights from the long career of architect Lord Richard Rogers Millennium Dome architect Richard Rogers has died at the age of 88. A spokesman said he had ""passed away quietly"" on Saturday evening. He first came to prominence with his radical designs for the Pompidou Centre in Paris and the Lloyd's of London building. Lord Rogers was regarded as one of the world's most successful and influential architects, and he won most of his industry's major honours. He was knighted in 1991. Born in 1933 to an Anglo-Italian family in Florence, he trained at the Architectural Association School of Architecture in London before graduating with a master's from Yale. Obituary: Richard Rogers Pompidou and Dome architect Richard Rogers retires In the 1970s and 1980s, he became widely known for two buildings that were controversial at the time for putting amenities like lifts and air conditioning ducts on the outside - the Pompidou in Paris and the Lloyd's building in London. The extraordinary looking Millennium Dome is now the O2 Arena His other creations included the European Court of Human Rights in Strasbourg, the Welsh Parliament's Senedd building in Cardiff, Terminal 5 at Heathrow Airport and Terminal 4 of Madrid's Barajas Airport. He also built 3 World Trade Center in New York, an 80-storey skyscraper on the site of the former Twin Towers. His critics over the years included Prince Charles, who spoke about his dislike of Lord Rogers' designs on several occasions.

coronavirus section,here. And hereâs a reminder of todayâs main UK headlines.  Weâll be ending our live coverage for today shortly but, before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main  coronavirus headlines from around the world. As we mentioned earlier, a further 82,886 Covid cases were reported across the UK yesterday. That takes the seven-day average for cases to 78,229 per day. Last week saw three consecutive record days for daily cases in the UK and that trend is expected to continue next week. Despite the high cases numbers experienced across the UK, deaths remain stable, with the seven-day average now 111. However, death statistics tend to lag about two weeks behind cases, as it takes time for an infected person to fall seriously ill. Meanwhile, 49% of the population has now received a third or booster vaccine, while 90% of people have had at least one dose. Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Larger-than-life inflatable Santas bob outside a Christmas tree stall, enticing
customers into one of the few places allowed to stay open in the Netherlands, which is now wholly locked down. The window-shopping students I met responded to the closure of bars, restaurants and all
non-essential shops with frustration and resignation. It feels like a really
bad deja vu, one told me. His girlfriend is finding it difficult to accept the
pause in what would normally be a packed festive calendar. George,
a chef in The Hague told me he will be going into work tomorrow but only to
throw away all the fresh food they were planning to serve. The
Dutch PM described this lockdown as an ""unavoidable"" response to
Omicron. But his critics point to what was perceived by some as the mismanagement of the Delta strain and
relatively slow rollout of the booster vaccination programme. The over-60s have only just been invited to get their extra shots. Across
Europe this Christmas, coming together is becoming harder, and riskier, than
anyone would have wished. An additional 12,133 confirmed cases of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 have been reported across the UK, according to the UK Health Security Agency. This brings the total confirmed cases of the variant in the UK to 37,101. However, the true number of Omicron cases is likely to be significantly higher. Allow Twitter content?

Thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets of Brussels to protest against coronavirus measures, including the need to show a Covid pass to access bars and restaurants. Covid passes are issued to people who have been vaccinated. ""We think the Covid safe ticket is discriminatory,"" one protester told Reuters news agency, adding that Belgians should not have their ""freedoms"" curtailed for refusing jabs. Police estimated that about 3,500 people attended Sunday's march. Many waved flags and carried signs reading ""I am free, you are free, we are free"" and ""no to mandatory vaccination"". Belgium has reported almost two million cases of coronavirus and 27,895 Covid-related deaths since the start of the pandemic. Northern Ireland's Covid-19 booster vaccination programme has opened to over-18s who received their second dose at least three months ago. The chief medical officer says Omicron could be the most dominant variant in NI by Christmas and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill has said it will hit the country ""like a tonne of bricks"". Health trusts are operating walk-in booster vaccination clinics, with up-to-date information on each trust's social media platforms, the Department of Health says. Over-30s can currentlybook a slot online,external, while bookings are expected to be made available for people in the 18 to 29 age group in the next few days. A further 82,886 coronavirus cases have been reported in the UK - as the more transmissible Omicron variant continues to surge around the country. That figure is down on yesterday's total, which was over 90,000, but significantly up on this time last week There have also been a further 45 deaths recorded within 28 days of a positive Covid test. Wales is likely to see a ""tsunami"" of Covid cases, according to a public health official. Current plans to tackle the Omicron variant in Wales may not be enough, a leading government adviser has said. Public Health Wales' Dr Giri Shankar saysfurther restrictions could be needed. He adds that Wales is ""likely to see a tsunami of cases"" in the coming weeks. The first minister has already said thatother restrictions could be introducedwhilenightclubs will close from 27 December. With the furlough scheme having come to end in September, questions have been raised as to how nightclub staff are going to paid. But Mark Drakefordsays: ""We will look as a government to see if there's any help we can give that sector to support people who would otherwise be laid off. ""We are certainly not gambling with anybody's livelihood. We've put Â£60m on the table."" Booster jabs given in England have hit a record high, with more than 830,000 administered on Saturday. A record 906,656 vaccine doses were given in total, including first and second jabs, NHS England said.  Of those, 830,403 were booster jabs. A rate of around one million a day is needed if every adult is to be offered a booster jab by the end of the year. You can find more details here on how to book a jab. More than half of new Covid-19 cases in the Republic of Ireland are believed to be Omicron cases, meaning it is now the Republic's dominant variant. Ireland's Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan urged people to get vaccinated and reduce their social contacts. He said it had taken less than two weeks for Omicron to become dominant in Ireland, which revealed ""just how transmissible this variant is"". A further 5,124 confirmed cases of Covid-19 were reported on Sunday. From Monday, hospitality venues, cinemas and theatres will have to close at 20:00. Read more about the new measures in Ireland,here. Football fans clashed with police ahead of a game in Rotterdam As we've been reporting here,the Netherlands has today entered a strict lockdownthat is expected to remain in force until at least mid-January. All non-essential shops are closed, as well as bars and other public venues, and only two guests are permitted per household - four over the holidays - leaving Christmas plans in disarray. In the capital, Amsterdam, streets and squares usually filled with people at this time of year shopping and socialising were noticeably quiet. In Rotterdam, hundreds of people gathered outside a football stadium ahead of a game between local team Feyenoord and rivals Ajax Amsterdam. Fireworks and bottles were thrown at police, who used water cannon to disperse the crowds. Several arrests were made. Fans have been banned from attending sporting events in the Netherlands since the end of November in an effort to limit the spread of Omicron.  Israelis are already barred from travelling to France, Ireland, Norway, Spain, Finland, and Sweden among other nations In Israel, the health ministry has recommended banning Israelis from travelling to the United States in what would be a major step. It has also recommended adding several European countries including Italy, Germany and Portugal to its red list for international travel. The UK and most of Africa is already on Israel's red list. ""European countries are either in lockdown or are heading that way,"" Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said, adding that for Israel ""time is running out"". Such measures would have to be approved by parliament. US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci says travelling increases the risk of spreading coronavirus, even among those people who are fully vaccinated. ""There's no doubt about this, [Omicron] has an extraordinary capability of spreading,"" he told NBC News' Meet the Press show on Sunday. Dr Fauci, who advises the White House on Covid, says the variant is now ""raging through the world"". ""Our hospitals, if things look like they're looking now, are going to be very stressed,"" he warns. ""The difference between a vaccinated and boosted person who has an infection, and someone who has an infection who has never been vaccinated - it's a major difference with regard to the risk of severity,"" Dr Fauci adds. More than 77% of the eligible US population has received at least one Covid vaccination, according tothe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,external. Shoppers on Princes Street in Edinburgh wore masks on the last Saturday before Christmas As we just reported, the leaders of the devolved nations are due to meet later today as concern grows over the spread of Omicron. In Scotland, senior officials are suggesting that tougher Covid restrictions could be introduced around the new year. Prof Jason Leitch, the country's national clinical director, said it was better to ""act harder"" and ""early"" while Scotland Office Minister Iain Stewart has said ""big decisions"" may need to be made. Scots are currently being advised to reduce their socialising and limit gatherings to three households. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon previously warned that Omicron was the dominant strain of the virus and a ""tsunami"" was beginning to hit Scotland. You can read more here. Cabinet Office Minister Steve Barclay will chair a meeting between the government's emergency committee, Cobra, and the leaders of the devolved nations at 17:00 GMT. Confirmation of the meeting comes shortly after the Health Security Agency announced that 12,133 additional cases of the Omicron variant had been reported across the UK. This brings the total of confirmed Omicron cases in the UK to 37,101. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Introducing
restrictions buys time, but it does not solve the problem. The
risk is you just delay the inevitable because you get a rebound in infections
once they are lifted. So
the question that has to be asked is, what will be done with the time that a
short circuit breaker would provide if it was introduced. It
would certainly allow more boosters to be given. But more than 80% of the most
vulnerable have already been boosted, so the gains from that are nowhere near what they
were for last winterâs lockdown when the vaccine programme was in its infancy. If
admissions were to rise as quickly as some of the most pessimistic modelling
suggests, restrictions could stop the NHS being overwhelmed by flattening the
peak. This
perhaps remains the strongest argument in favour of a circuit breaker given the
uncertainty for the moment over how much serious illness will be caused by this
Omicron wave. And
all of that, of course, needs to be weighed against the costs to
society, the economy and wider mental health. You can read more from Nick on what tougher measures will achieve,here. If youâre just joining us, here are the key developments so far today: As we've reported, the British Chambers of Commerce and the British Retail Consortium have been calling for more financial support from the government for hard-hit businesses. In response, the government says it will continue to ""engage constructively"" with businesses as measures to control Omicron take effect. A spokesperson for the Treasury said:
""The Chancellor has spoken to a range of business and industry leaders in recent days. ""We recognise how important the festive period is for so many businesses and the government will continue to engage constructively on how it can best provide ongoing support to the businesses and sectors affected.""

Brexit border problem: A guide,"The government has set out new post-Brexit trade arrangements between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the European Union (EU). Northern Ireland's largest unionist party, the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), refused to support earlier plans but has backed the new deal. Itclears the way for the Northern Ireland Assembly to meet again- two years after power-sharing collapsed. Trade between Northern Ireland, the rest of the UK and the Republic of Ireland was straightforward before Brexit - all parties were in the EU and shared the same trade rules. However, when the UK left the EU, a deal was required to allow trade to continue between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland. The EU has strict food rules, and requires border checks when certain goods - such as milk and eggs - arrive from non-EU countries like the UK. Paperwork is also required for other goods. But the idea of checks at the Irish border is a sensitive issue because of Northern Ireland's political history. It was feared that introducing cameras or border posts as part of checks on incoming and outgoing goods could lead to instability. Post-Brexit controls on food and farm imports start What trade deals has the UK done since Brexit? The new dealagreed between the UK government and the DUP,external- called ""Safeguarding the Union"" - will reduce checks and paperwork on goods going from Great Britain (England, Scotland and Wales) to Northern Ireland. There will be no routine checks on British items being sold to consumers in Northern Ireland. However, some British products brought in for processing, such as raw materials and components, will still face full customs processes. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson said the deal meets his party's objectives. He said: ""We're no longer in a situation where if you bring goods in to sell in Northern Ireland, you need a customs declaration."" The UK government will also introduce two pieces of legislation, to guarantee Northern Irish goods can be sold in Great Britain in all circumstances, and to confirm Northern Ireland's place in the UK. A new body called Intertrade UK will work to boost trade between UK nations. At present, some online shoppers in Northern Ireland are told goods sold in the rest of the UK are not available for them to buy. What exactly is in the DUP deal? The first agreement with the EU, called the Northern Ireland Protocol, came into force on 1 January 2021. That introduced new checks on goods from Great Britain, at Northern Ireland's ports. The checks applied even if the goods were to remain in Northern Ireland. This angered unionists and led the DUP to boycott Northern Ireland's power-sharing administration at Stormont. The Windsor Framework was announced by Rishi Sunak and European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen The protocol was amended by another agreement called the Windsor Framework, which wasadopted by the UK and EU in 2023. It created two ""lanes"" for goods arriving in Northern Ireland from Great Britain: Agreen lanefor goods remaining in Northern Ireland Ared lanefor goods which may be sent on to the EU Products going through the green lane do not need checks or additional paperwork. Red lane goods are still subject to checks. A ban on certain products - like chilled sausages - entering Northern Ireland from Great Britain was removed. And Northern Ireland no longer had to follow certain EU rules, for example on VAT and alcohol duties. The Windsor Framework also introduced a mechanism called the ""Stormont brake"",which would let the Northern Ireland Assembly object to new EU rules which would affect Northern Ireland's trade arrangements. That has not been tested yet because the assembly has not sat since the agreement was made. Despite the DUP's refusal to support the Windsor Framework,the system of green and red lines started operating on 1 October 2023. The BBC's NI economics and business editor John Campbell says the new deal maximises the flexibility allowed under the existing Windsor Framework, without changing its fundamental elements.

Weâll be ending our live coverage for today shortly but, before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main  coronavirus headlines from around the world. As we mentioned earlier, a further 82,886 Covid cases were reported across the UK yesterday. That takes the seven-day average for cases to 78,229 per day. Last week saw three consecutive record days for daily cases in the UK and that trend is expected to continue next week. Despite the high cases numbers experienced across the UK, deaths remain stable, with the seven-day average now 111. However, death statistics tend to lag about two weeks behind cases, as it takes time for an infected person to fall seriously ill. Meanwhile, 49% of the population has now received a third or booster vaccine, while 90% of people have had at least one dose. Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Larger-than-life inflatable Santas bob outside a Christmas tree stall, enticing
customers into one of the few places allowed to stay open in the Netherlands, which is now wholly locked down. The window-shopping students I met responded to the closure of bars, restaurants and all

a chef in The Hague told me he will be going into work tomorrow but only to
throw away all the fresh food they were planning to serve. The
Dutch PM described this lockdown as an ""unavoidable"" response to
Omicron. But his critics point to what was perceived by some as the mismanagement of the Delta strain and
relatively slow rollout of the booster vaccination programme. The over-60s have only just been invited to get their extra shots. Across
Europe this Christmas, coming together is becoming harder, and riskier, than
anyone would have wished. An additional 12,133 confirmed cases of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 have been reported across the UK, according to the UK Health Security Agency. This brings the total confirmed cases of the variant in the UK to 37,101. However, the true number of Omicron cases is likely to be significantly higher. Allow Twitter content?

Thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets of Brussels to protest against coronavirus measures, including the need to show a Covid pass to access bars and restaurants. Covid passes are issued to people who have been vaccinated. ""We think the Covid safe ticket is discriminatory,"" one protester told Reuters news agency, adding that Belgians should not have their ""freedoms"" curtailed for refusing jabs. Police estimated that about 3,500 people attended Sunday's march. Many waved flags and carried signs reading ""I am free, you are free, we are free"" and ""no to mandatory vaccination"". Belgium has reported almost two million cases of coronavirus and 27,895 Covid-related deaths since the start of the pandemic. Northern Ireland's Covid-19 booster vaccination programme has opened to over-18s who received their second dose at least three months ago. The chief medical officer says Omicron could be the most dominant variant in NI by Christmas and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill has said it will hit the country ""like a tonne of bricks"". Health trusts are operating walk-in booster vaccination clinics, with up-to-date information on each trust's social media platforms, the Department of Health says. Over-30s can currentlybook a slot online,external, while bookings are expected to be made available for people in the 18 to 29 age group in the next few days. A further 82,886 coronavirus cases have been reported in the UK - as the more transmissible Omicron variant continues to surge around the country. That figure is down on yesterday's total, which was over 90,000, but significantly up on this time last week There have also been a further 45 deaths recorded within 28 days of a positive Covid test. Wales is likely to see a ""tsunami"" of Covid cases, according to a public health official. Current plans to tackle the Omicron variant in Wales may not be enough, a leading government adviser has said. Public Health Wales' Dr Giri Shankar saysfurther restrictions could be needed. He adds that Wales is ""likely to see a tsunami of cases"" in the coming weeks. The first minister has already said thatother restrictions could be introducedwhilenightclubs will close from 27 December. With the furlough scheme having come to end in September, questions have been raised as to how nightclub staff are going to paid. But Mark Drakefordsays: ""We will look as a government to see if there's any help we can give that sector to support people who would otherwise be laid off. ""We are certainly not gambling with anybody's livelihood. We've put Â£60m on the table."" Booster jabs given in England have hit a record high, with more than 830,000 administered on Saturday. A record 906,656 vaccine doses were given in total, including first and second jabs, NHS England said.  Of those, 830,403 were booster jabs. A rate of around one million a day is needed if every adult is to be offered a booster jab by the end of the year. You can find more details here on how to book a jab. More than half of new Covid-19 cases in the Republic of Ireland are believed to be Omicron cases, meaning it is now the Republic's dominant variant. Ireland's Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan urged people to get vaccinated and reduce their social contacts. He said it had taken less than two weeks for Omicron to become dominant in Ireland, which revealed ""just how transmissible this variant is"". A further 5,124 confirmed cases of Covid-19 were reported on Sunday. From Monday, hospitality venues, cinemas and theatres will have to close at 20:00. Read more about the new measures in Ireland,here. Football fans clashed with police ahead of a game in Rotterdam As we've been reporting here,the Netherlands has today entered a strict lockdownthat is expected to remain in force until at least mid-January. All non-essential shops are closed, as well as bars and other public venues, and only two guests are permitted per household - four over the holidays - leaving Christmas plans in disarray. In the capital, Amsterdam, streets and squares usually filled with people at this time of year shopping and socialising were noticeably quiet. In Rotterdam, hundreds of people gathered outside a football stadium ahead of a game between local team Feyenoord and rivals Ajax Amsterdam. Fireworks and bottles were thrown at police, who used water cannon to disperse the crowds. Several arrests were made. Fans have been banned from attending sporting events in the Netherlands since the end of November in an effort to limit the spread of Omicron.  Israelis are already barred from travelling to France, Ireland, Norway, Spain, Finland, and Sweden among other nations In Israel, the health ministry has recommended banning Israelis from travelling to the United States in what would be a major step. It has also recommended adding several European countries including Italy, Germany and Portugal to its red list for international travel. The UK and most of Africa is already on Israel's red list. ""European countries are either in lockdown or are heading that way,"" Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said, adding that for Israel ""time is running out"". Such measures would have to be approved by parliament. US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci says travelling increases the risk of spreading coronavirus, even among those people who are fully vaccinated. ""There's no doubt about this, [Omicron] has an extraordinary capability of spreading,"" he told NBC News' Meet the Press show on Sunday. Dr Fauci, who advises the White House on Covid, says the variant is now ""raging through the world"". ""Our hospitals, if things look like they're looking now, are going to be very stressed,"" he warns. ""The difference between a vaccinated and boosted person who has an infection, and someone who has an infection who has never been vaccinated - it's a major difference with regard to the risk of severity,"" Dr Fauci adds. More than 77% of the eligible US population has received at least one Covid vaccination, according tothe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,external. Shoppers on Princes Street in Edinburgh wore masks on the last Saturday before Christmas As we just reported, the leaders of the devolved nations are due to meet later today as concern grows over the spread of Omicron. In Scotland, senior officials are suggesting that tougher Covid restrictions could be introduced around the new year. Prof Jason Leitch, the country's national clinical director, said it was better to ""act harder"" and ""early"" while Scotland Office Minister Iain Stewart has said ""big decisions"" may need to be made. Scots are currently being advised to reduce their socialising and limit gatherings to three households. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon previously warned that Omicron was the dominant strain of the virus and a ""tsunami"" was beginning to hit Scotland. You can read more here. Cabinet Office Minister Steve Barclay will chair a meeting between the government's emergency committee, Cobra, and the leaders of the devolved nations at 17:00 GMT. Confirmation of the meeting comes shortly after the Health Security Agency announced that 12,133 additional cases of the Omicron variant had been reported across the UK. This brings the total of confirmed Omicron cases in the UK to 37,101. Nick TriggleHealth Correspondent Introducing
restrictions buys time, but it does not solve the problem. The
risk is you just delay the inevitable because you get a rebound in infections
once they are lifted. So
the question that has to be asked is, what will be done with the time that a
short circuit breaker would provide if it was introduced. It
would certainly allow more boosters to be given. But more than 80% of the most
vulnerable have already been boosted, so the gains from that are nowhere near what they
were for last winterâs lockdown when the vaccine programme was in its infancy. If
admissions were to rise as quickly as some of the most pessimistic modelling
suggests, restrictions could stop the NHS being overwhelmed by flattening the
peak. This
perhaps remains the strongest argument in favour of a circuit breaker given the
uncertainty for the moment over how much serious illness will be caused by this
Omicron wave. And
all of that, of course, needs to be weighed against the costs to
society, the economy and wider mental health. You can read more from Nick on what tougher measures will achieve,here. If youâre just joining us, here are the key developments so far today: As we've reported, the British Chambers of Commerce and the British Retail Consortium have been calling for more financial support from the government for hard-hit businesses. In response, the government says it will continue to ""engage constructively"" with businesses as measures to control Omicron take effect. A spokesperson for the Treasury said:
""The Chancellor has spoken to a range of business and industry leaders in recent days. ""We recognise how important the festive period is for so many businesses and the government will continue to engage constructively on how it can best provide ongoing support to the businesses and sectors affected.""

"Lord Frost resigns as Brexit ministerHe says he hopes Boris Johnson will not be tempted by ""coercive measures"" to tackle Covid.","Brexit minister Lord Frost has resigned from the UK government over ""concerns about the current direction of travel"". In a letter to Boris Johnson, the peer, who led Brexit negotiations, said he hoped the PM would ""not be tempted"" by ""coercive measures"" to tackle Covid. Earlier this week, Mr Johnson facedthe largest rebellion of his premiershipfrom Tory MPs over measures to limit the spread of the new Omicron variant. But the UK has seen days of record cases, with 90,418 on Saturday alone. And more than 12,000 confirmed Omicron infections were reported on Sunday. Scientific advisers have also warned England's hospital admissionscould reach 3,000 a day without further restrictions. Health Secretary Sajid Javid said Lord Frost was an ""outstanding public servant"", telling the BBC's Andrew Marr programme that while he disagreed with his remarks, the minister had ""resigned out of principle... and we have to respect that"". But Labour's deputy leader, Angela Rayner, said the resignation suggested the government was ""in total chaos right when the country faces an uncertain few weeks"". Ministers received a briefing on the latest Covid data on Saturday afternoon and a meeting of the Cobra emergency committee is expected to take place at 17:00 GMT. And Mr Javid warnedthere were ""no guarantees""on whether further restrictions would be brought in. No guarantees on new Covid restrictions - Javid Lord Frost's resignation letter in full Brexit border problem: A simple guide Lord Frost's resignation also comes after amajor by-election defeatfor the Conservatives, losing the formerly safe seat of North Shropshire to the Liberal Democrats. The Mail on Sunday,which first reported the news,external, said he handed in his resignation a week ago, partly in disagreement with Covid curbs. But in his letter to the prime minister, Lord Frost said now the arrangement to exit in January had been made public, he would leave with ""immediate effect"". He wrote that Mr Johnson had been ""an outstanding leader"" during turbulence over Brexit, and the pair had a ""close common understanding"" on their aims in that area. But after saying ""Brexit is now secure"", he added: ""You know my concerns about the current direction of travel. ""I hope we will move as fast as possible to where we need to get to: a lightly regulated, low-tax, entrepreneurial economy, at the cutting edge of modern science and economic change."" Lord Frost moved on to his concerns over the government's handling of the virus, saying the country needed to ""learn to live with Covid"". ""I know that is your instinct too,"" he wrote. ""You took a brave decision in July, against considerable opposition, to open up the country again. ""Sadly it did not prove to be irreversible, as I wished, and believe you did too. ""I hope we can get back on track soon and not be tempted by the kind of coercive measures we have seen elsewhere."" In his reply, Mr Johnson did not address the critical elements of the letter, but said the now former minister should be ""immensely proud of your historic service to this government and this country"". Mr Javid told Andrew Marr that Lord Frost was ""entitled to his views,"" but added: ""My own view in terms of the direction of travel, dealing with this pandemic, which is something no-one expected when we won the last general election, but also getting on with the priorities of the British peopleâ¦ this is all a huge part of what the government is getting on with."" He said he did not want ""restrict people's freedoms"" with Covid measures, but added: ""The British people do understand this pandemic requires extraordinary actions and that's what last week was."" Asked if any further measures would be announced after reports of impending circuit breaker lockdowns ahead of Christmas, Mr Javid said: ""There are no guarantees in this pandemic. At this point we have to keep everything under review."" But the health secretary said it ""would be for parliament to decide"" if any additional restrictions came into force. Analysis by Jennifer Scott, BBC political reporter The past few weeks have been torrid for Boris Johnson. From the fallout of the Owen Paterson scandal, to Christmas parties, Tory rebellions and by-election losses, there is no doubt his authority in No 10 has wavered. So the resignation of close ally and Brexit backer Lord Frost cannot have been a welcome early Christmas present. With Omicron cases on the up and fears of what could come next, there are rumours abound that the PM will have to bring in more measures to tackle the variant. But the exit of Lord Frost has also given a certain section of rebellious backbenchers another chance to voice their frustrations with Johnson, and it seems unlikely they would support restrictions, having already rejected Plan B measures in the week. With Health Secretary Sajid Javid saying there are ""no guarantees"" around what moves the government may have to make, Johnson could again be looking to Labour votes to secure any plan he comes up with. But that will be yet another blow to an already-bruised prime minister and increase the volume of those angry MPs in his own party. MPs have had mixed reactions to Lord Frost's exit from government. But some of the 100 rebels who voted against the additional Covid measures that passed through the Commons earlier this week -including the use of Covid passports for some venues- said the resignation should act as a warning to Mr Johnson. On Saturday night, Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries was kicked out of a WhatsApp group of Tory MPs - which counts many of the rebels as members - by former Brexit minister Steve Baker, after calling for ""a bit of loyalty"" towards the prime minister. Afterwards, Mr Baker posted: ""Enough is enough."" This video can not be played 'A great loss' - Watch Tory MP Pete Bone describe how Conservative colleagues reacted to Lord Frost's resignation Tory MP Andrew Bridgen said the PM was ""running out of time and out of friends to deliver on the promises and discipline of a true Conservative government"". He added: ""Lord Frost has made it clear, 100 Conservative backbenchers have made it clear, but most importantly so did the people of North Shropshire."" But their Tory colleague Simon Hoare, who chairs the Commons Northern Ireland select committee, said the peer was ""unsuited to the 'doing of politics'"" and ""never understood the need for personal rapport or the importance of trust"". Lord Frost had most recently been engaged in negotiations with the EU over post-Brexit arrangements. This included elements of the Northern Ireland Protocol, agreed by the UK and EU in 2019, that allows goods to cross the border between Northern Ireland and the Republic of Ireland without checks. The protocolhas been criticised by some businessesfor making it more difficult to send goods to Northern Ireland from Great Britain. DUP leader Sir Jeffrey Donaldson, who has been a long standing critic of the agreement, said the resignation raised questions about the UK's approach to the protocol. He said Mr Johnson ""must now urgently decide which is more important - the protocol or the stability of the political institutions"". Northern Ireland's deputy first minister, Sinn Fein's Michelle O'Neill, said momentum was needed in negotiations to make the protocol work better. ""The North will not be collateral damage in the Tory chaos,"" she added. It's easy for analysts or journalists to dial-an-EU diplomat following David Frost's resignation as Brexit minister and hear them say something ""not very complimentary"" (if we're being polite). Lord Frost's ""hardball"" manner was not appreciated in Brussels, but it was recognised as a negotiating tactic. However, it would be a mistake to believe his departure will have a massive impact on post-Brexit relations. Mistrust in the UK government will likely remain, long after Lord Frost leaves. Why? Because key EU leaders, like Germany's Angela Merkel (and her successor Olaf Scholz), France's Emmanuel Macron and the Netherlands' Mark Rutte, say they believe successive UK prime ministers - namely David Cameron, Theresa May and Boris Johnson - were dishonest with them. The oft-heard Brussels view is that UK governments tried to ""play the EU like fools"" as of setting the Brexit referendum date, with prime ministers speaking to the EU about Brexit in a more collegiate manner, then becoming far more hard-line when addressing the UK domestic audience - in particular, their own Conservative Party. As of now depending on the decisions by Boris Johnson, and the PM that eventually follows him (whenever that may be), rather than Lord Frost's departure, whether cross-Channel relations can improve or deteriorate. This is not about reversing Brexit, or changing a hard Brexit to a soft one. It's more a question of whether or not the two sides can work better together on the Northern Ireland Protocol, wider post-Brexit trade issues, security and defence, and financial services. Brussels is pessimistic, at least in the short-term. But future EU-UK relations are about a lot more than Lord Frost. CHRISTMAS IN THE MIDDLE AGES:What were the festivities like for our ancestors?

""The difference between a vaccinated and boosted person who has an infection, and someone who has an infection who has never been vaccinated - it's a major difference with regard to the risk of severity,"" Dr Fauci adds. More than 77% of the eligible US population has received at least one Covid vaccination, according tothe Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,external. Shoppers on Princes Street in Edinburgh wore masks on the last Saturday before Christmas As we just reported, the leaders of the devolved nations are due to meet later today as concern grows over the spread of Omicron. In Scotland, senior officials are suggesting that tougher Covid restrictions could be introduced around the new year. Prof Jason Leitch, the country's national clinical director, said it was better to ""act harder"" and ""early"" while Scotland Office Minister Iain Stewart has said ""big decisions"" may need to be made. Scots are currently being advised to reduce their socialising and limit gatherings to three households. First Minister Nicola Sturgeon previously warned that Omicron was the dominant strain of the virus and a ""tsunami"" was beginning to hit Scotland. You can read more here. Cabinet Office Minister Steve Barclay will chair a meeting between the government's emergency committee, Cobra, and the leaders of the devolved nations at 17:00 GMT. Confirmation of the meeting comes shortly after the Health Security Agency announced that 12,133 additional cases of the Omicron variant had been reported across the UK.

restrictions buys time, but it does not solve the problem. The
risk is you just delay the inevitable because you get a rebound in infections
once they are lifted. So
the question that has to be asked is, what will be done with the time that a
short circuit breaker would provide if it was introduced. It
would certainly allow more boosters to be given. But more than 80% of the most
vulnerable have already been boosted, so the gains from that are nowhere near what they
were for last winterâs lockdown when the vaccine programme was in its infancy. If
admissions were to rise as quickly as some of the most pessimistic modelling
suggests, restrictions could stop the NHS being overwhelmed by flattening the
peak. This
perhaps remains the strongest argument in favour of a circuit breaker given the
uncertainty for the moment over how much serious illness will be caused by this
Omicron wave. And
all of that, of course, needs to be weighed against the costs to
society, the economy and wider mental health. You can read more from Nick on what tougher measures will achieve,here. If youâre just joining us, here are the key developments so far today: As we've reported, the British Chambers of Commerce and the British Retail Consortium have been calling for more financial support from the government for hard-hit businesses. In response, the government says it will continue to ""engage constructively"" with businesses as measures to control Omicron take effect. A spokesperson for the Treasury said:
""The Chancellor has spoken to a range of business and industry leaders in recent days. ""We recognise how important the festive period is for so many businesses and the government will continue to engage constructively on how it can best provide ongoing support to the businesses and sectors affected.""

Weâll be ending our live coverage for today shortly but, before we go, hereâs a reminder of todayâs main  coronavirus headlines from around the world. As we mentioned earlier, a further 82,886 Covid cases were reported across the UK yesterday. That takes the seven-day average for cases to 78,229 per day. Last week saw three consecutive record days for daily cases in the UK and that trend is expected to continue next week. Despite the high cases numbers experienced across the UK, deaths remain stable, with the seven-day average now 111. However, death statistics tend to lag about two weeks behind cases, as it takes time for an infected person to fall seriously ill. Meanwhile, 49% of the population has now received a third or booster vaccine, while 90% of people have had at least one dose. Anna HolliganBBC News Hague correspondent Larger-than-life inflatable Santas bob outside a Christmas tree stall, enticing
customers into one of the few places allowed to stay open in the Netherlands, which is now wholly locked down. The window-shopping students I met responded to the closure of bars, restaurants and all
non-essential shops with frustration and resignation. It feels like a really
bad deja vu, one told me. His girlfriend is finding it difficult to accept the
pause in what would normally be a packed festive calendar. George,
a chef in The Hague told me he will be going into work tomorrow but only to
throw away all the fresh food they were planning to serve. The
Dutch PM described this lockdown as an ""unavoidable"" response to
Omicron. But his critics point to what was perceived by some as the mismanagement of the Delta strain and
relatively slow rollout of the booster vaccination programme. The over-60s have only just been invited to get their extra shots. Across
Europe this Christmas, coming together is becoming harder, and riskier, than
anyone would have wished. An additional 12,133 confirmed cases of the Omicron variant of Covid-19 have been reported across the UK, according to the UK Health Security Agency. This brings the total confirmed cases of the variant in the UK to 37,101. However, the true number of Omicron cases is likely to be significantly higher. Allow Twitter content?

Thousands of demonstrators have taken to the streets of Brussels to protest against coronavirus measures, including the need to show a Covid pass to access bars and restaurants. Covid passes are issued to people who have been vaccinated. ""We think the Covid safe ticket is discriminatory,"" one protester told Reuters news agency, adding that Belgians should not have their ""freedoms"" curtailed for refusing jabs. Police estimated that about 3,500 people attended Sunday's march. Many waved flags and carried signs reading ""I am free, you are free, we are free"" and ""no to mandatory vaccination"". Belgium has reported almost two million cases of coronavirus and 27,895 Covid-related deaths since the start of the pandemic. Northern Ireland's Covid-19 booster vaccination programme has opened to over-18s who received their second dose at least three months ago. The chief medical officer says Omicron could be the most dominant variant in NI by Christmas and Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill has said it will hit the country ""like a tonne of bricks"". Health trusts are operating walk-in booster vaccination clinics, with up-to-date information on each trust's social media platforms, the Department of Health says. Over-30s can currentlybook a slot online,external, while bookings are expected to be made available for people in the 18 to 29 age group in the next few days. A further 82,886 coronavirus cases have been reported in the UK - as the more transmissible Omicron variant continues to surge around the country. That figure is down on yesterday's total, which was over 90,000, but significantly up on this time last week There have also been a further 45 deaths recorded within 28 days of a positive Covid test. Wales is likely to see a ""tsunami"" of Covid cases, according to a public health official. Current plans to tackle the Omicron variant in Wales may not be enough, a leading government adviser has said. Public Health Wales' Dr Giri Shankar saysfurther restrictions could be needed. He adds that Wales is ""likely to see a tsunami of cases"" in the coming weeks. The first minister has already said thatother restrictions could be introducedwhilenightclubs will close from 27 December. With the furlough scheme having come to end in September, questions have been raised as to how nightclub staff are going to paid. But Mark Drakefordsays: ""We will look as a government to see if there's any help we can give that sector to support people who would otherwise be laid off. ""We are certainly not gambling with anybody's livelihood. We've put Â£60m on the table."" Booster jabs given in England have hit a record high, with more than 830,000 administered on Saturday. A record 906,656 vaccine doses were given in total, including first and second jabs, NHS England said.  Of those, 830,403 were booster jabs. A rate of around one million a day is needed if every adult is to be offered a booster jab by the end of the year. You can find more details here on how to book a jab. More than half of new Covid-19 cases in the Republic of Ireland are believed to be Omicron cases, meaning it is now the Republic's dominant variant. Ireland's Chief Medical Officer Dr Tony Holohan urged people to get vaccinated and reduce their social contacts. He said it had taken less than two weeks for Omicron to become dominant in Ireland, which revealed ""just how transmissible this variant is"". A further 5,124 confirmed cases of Covid-19 were reported on Sunday. From Monday, hospitality venues, cinemas and theatres will have to close at 20:00.

Football fans clashed with police ahead of a game in Rotterdam As we've been reporting here,the Netherlands has today entered a strict lockdownthat is expected to remain in force until at least mid-January. All non-essential shops are closed, as well as bars and other public venues, and only two guests are permitted per household - four over the holidays - leaving Christmas plans in disarray. In the capital, Amsterdam, streets and squares usually filled with people at this time of year shopping and socialising were noticeably quiet. In Rotterdam, hundreds of people gathered outside a football stadium ahead of a game between local team Feyenoord and rivals Ajax Amsterdam. Fireworks and bottles were thrown at police, who used water cannon to disperse the crowds. Several arrests were made. Fans have been banned from attending sporting events in the Netherlands since the end of November in an effort to limit the spread of Omicron.  Israelis are already barred from travelling to France, Ireland, Norway, Spain, Finland, and Sweden among other nations In Israel, the health ministry has recommended banning Israelis from travelling to the United States in what would be a major step. It has also recommended adding several European countries including Italy, Germany and Portugal to its red list for international travel. The UK and most of Africa is already on Israel's red list. ""European countries are either in lockdown or are heading that way,"" Prime Minister Naftali Bennett said, adding that for Israel ""time is running out"". Such measures would have to be approved by parliament. US infectious disease expert Dr Anthony Fauci says travelling increases the risk of spreading coronavirus, even among those people who are fully vaccinated. ""There's no doubt about this, [Omicron] has an extraordinary capability of spreading,"" he told NBC News' Meet the Press show on Sunday. Dr Fauci, who advises the White House on Covid, says the variant is now ""raging through the world"". ""Our hospitals, if things look like they're looking now, are going to be very stressed,"" he warns. ""The difference between a vaccinated and boosted person who has an infection, and someone who has an infection who has never been vaccinated - it's a major difference with regard to the risk of severity,"" Dr Fauci adds.
