"UK applying to join 11-nation Pacific trade pactIf successful, Britain will join a club including Japan and Australia and covering 500m people.Business","This video can not be played International trade secretary Liz Truss says Asia Pacific countries ""will provide big markets"" in the future for British products The UK will apply to join a free trade area with 11 Asia and Pacific nations on Monday, a year after it officially left the EU. Joining the group of ""fast-growing nations"" will boost UK exports, the government says. The Comprehensive and Progressive Agreement for Trans-Pacific Partnership - or CPTPP - covers a market of around 500 million people. But they are harder to reach than neighbouring markets in Europe. Members include Australia, Canada, Japan and New Zealand. Brunei, Chile, Malaysia, Mexico, Peru, Singapore and Vietnam are also founder members of the bloc, which was established in 2018. ""In future it's going to be Asia-Pacific countries in particular where the big markets are, where growing middle-class markets are, for British products,"" International Trade Secretary Liz Truss told the BBC's Andrew Marr. ""Of course British businesses will have to reach out and take these opportunities, but what I'm doing is I'm creating the opportunities, the low tariffs, removing those barriers so they can go out and do that."" Joining the bloc would reduce tariffs on UK exports such as whisky and cars, as well as service industries, she said. However the immediate impact is likely to be modest as the UK already has free trade deals in place with several CPTPP members, some of which were rolled over from its EU membership. The UK is negotiating deals with Australia and New Zealand. In total, CPTPP nations accounted for 8.4% of UK exports in 2019, roughly the same proportion as Germany alone. UK wants to join the club - but what is the CPTPP? How many trade deals has the UK done so far? The US was originally in talks to be part of the CPTPP, butformer President Donald Trump pulled outwhen he took office. If the new administration in Washington were to reconsider the CPTPP, that would make membership much more attractive to the UK. It could allow a much closer UK-US trading relationship, without waiting for a bilateral trade deal to be negotiated. Exactly a year after it said goodbye to the EU, the UK is eying a new trading club. It sounds a win-win: those Pacific Rim nations represent 13% of global income and 500 million people - and the UK would retain the freedom to strike deals elsewhere. There'd be agreement on how standards and regulations are set (with minimums to be adhered to) - but they wouldn't need to be identical. In practice, however, the short-terms gains for households and business would be limited. The UK already has trade deals with seven of the 11 nations - and is pursuing two more. In total, CPTPP nations account for less than 10% of UK exports, a fraction of what goes to the EU. This deal would however deepen some of those ties - and allow UK manufacturers who source components from multiple nations in the bloc some benefits under ""rules of origins"" allowances. But the real boost could come in the future, if others join - in particular the US, as President Biden has hinted. That would give the UK that hoped-for trade deal with America - within a trading bloc wielding considerable power on the global stage. Read more from Dharshini The UK is the first non-founding country to apply to join the CPTPP and, if successful, would be its second biggest economy after Japan. The free trade block aims to reduce trade tariffs - a form of border tax - between member countries. It includes a promise to eliminate or reduce 95% of import charges- although some of these charges are kept to protect some home-made products, for example Japan's rice and Canada's dairy industry. In return, countries must cooperate on regulations, such as food standards. However, these standards and regulations do not have to be identical, and member countries can strike their own trade deals. The government was putting place strategies that would ""deliver for Britain in 2030 and 2050"", Ms Truss said. She said services, robotics, data and digital industries were particularly set to gain, which could lead to more UK jobs. Membership will also offer the potential for faster and cheaper visas for business people, the government said. The formal request to join will be made on Monday, with negotiations expected in the spring. NEWSCAST:A row has erupted between the EU and drugs company AstraZeneca over vaccine shortages.

India cuts internet to hunger-striking farmersTensions are rising in Delhi where thousands of farmers are demanding agriculture reforms be repealed.India,"Thousands of farmers blocked a road in Ghazipur near Delhi on Saturday India has suspended mobile internet services in three areas around the capital, Delhi, where farmers are staging a hunger strike in protest at new agriculture laws. The government said the shutdown would continue until Sunday night to ""maintain public safety"". Tens of thousands of protesting farmers have been camped out on Delhi's outskirts for more than a month. Talks between unions and the government have failed to break the deadlock. The protest made international headlines on Tuesday whena tractor rally ended in violent clashesthat left one protester dead and dozens of police officers injured. Some demonstrators stormed Delhi's historic Red Fort and occupied it until police pushed them back. What's next for India farmers' protest? How PM Modi misread the mood of India's farmers What has brought India's farmers to the streets? On Saturday, the interior ministry said mobile internet services had been suspended at Singhu, Ghazipur and Tikri - the districts where farmers have gathered - until 23:00 (17:30 GMT) on Sunday. Farmers' leaders said Saturday's one-day hunger strike had been timed to coincide with the anniversary of the death of independence leader Mahatma Gandhi. ""The farmers' movement was peaceful and will be peaceful,"" said union leader Darshan Pal. This video can not be played One night at the farmers' protest Protesters themselves reacted angrily to the internet shutdown, Reuters reported. One farmer, Sandee Sharma, accused officials of trying to ""create a panic"" while another, Bhavesh Yadav, said it was ""killing democracy."" The government action comes amid rising tensions at the locations where farmers are based. On Friday, clashes broke out at Singhuwhen a group of unidentified men approached farmers and reportedly told them to leave. Farmers say the men threw stones at them and destroyed tents. Several injuries were reported. Indian media said the men were local residents who accused the protesters of disturbing the peace and damaging the local economy. The laws loosen rules around the sale, pricing and storage of farm produce which have protected India's farmers from the free market for decades. Farmers fear that the new laws will threaten decades-old concessions - such as assured prices - and weaken their bargaining power, leaving them vulnerable to exploitation by private companies. Farmers have been camped out around Delhi for weeks Indian Prime Minister Narendra Mod has defended the reforms but the laws have been likened to a ""death warrant"" by unions. Agriculture employs about half of India's 1.3 billion population but the sector accounts for barely a sixth of the country's gross domestic product (GDP) - which measures the value of goods and services produced in the economy. Analysts say declining productivity and a lack of modernisation have shrunk incomes and hobbled agriculture in India for decades.

Apology after children invited for Covid vaccine,"Currently the elderly and most vulnerable are being prioritised for vaccinations Health bosses have apologised after some clinically extremely vulnerable children were mistakenly sent letters inviting them for a Covid vaccination. Nottingham and Nottinghamshire Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) sent the letter to children under the age of 16. Currently no-one under the age of 16 has been advised to have a vaccine. In a statement, the CCG said the mix-up was due to a ""processing error"" and they were ""extremely sorry"", urging anyone who got a letter to ignore it. ""Due to the processing error reported, we are aware that some children under the age of 16 who are classed as clinically extremely vulnerable (CEV) have mistakenly received a letter inviting them for a Covid-19 vaccination,"" it said. ""We are extremely sorry for this mix-up."" Earlier on Friday, the CCG also sent letters to people classed as clinically vulnerable with an incorrect link. The letter included an online link that only works for those over 70, which the CCG said was also down to the ""processing error"". A CCG spokeswoman said people aged under 70 who are vulnerable would be sent a second letter with a new link, and would need to bring that to any appointment. The BBC understands that error affected about 18,000 people. Cancer patient Paul Schober said he was left feeling ""frustrated"" Paul Schober, from Rempstone in Nottinghamshire, who was affected, has been shielding since before the first lockdown following chemotherapy. The 68-year-old cancer patient said he was ""frustrated"" with the error. ""To be offered the vaccine and then to be trapped in some Kafkaesque nightmare where you can't get your booking accepted... I wasn't very happy at all,"" he said. Follow BBC East Midlands onFacebook,external, onTwitter,external, or onInstagram,external. Send your story ideas toeastmidsnews@bbc.co.uk,external.

The musician, who preferred not to use gendered pronouns,told Billboard,externalthat being trans meant ""taking control to bring your body more in line with your soul and spirit so the two aren't fighting against each other and struggling to survive"", The artist's management said Sophie would be remembered ""not only for ingenious production and creativity but also for the message and visibility that was achieved. An icon of liberation"".

UK trading platform IG stops new GameStop trades,"One of the UK's biggest financial trading platforms, IG, has stopped any new trades in GameStop and theatre chain AMC when markets open on Monday. US video games retailer GameStop is the focus of a trading war between amateurs and Wall Street pros. Both GameStop and AMC Entertainment have seen their share prices boom as amateur investors, fuelled by chat on social media, bought their shares. In a statement IG said the restrictions will be reviewed regularly. This video can not be played WATCH: What's been going on at GameStop? Other popular stock market trading apps also temporarily halted dealings in GameStop on Thursday, after its shares soared as much as 700% in the past week. AMC Entertainment and Blackberry, which have also seen huge trading activity, were among the other companies hit by the trading restrictions. But the move left investors outraged, accusing the trading platforms of working on behalf of traditional Wall Street investors who were losing out. Several platforms then rowed back on their stance. Simple guide to the GameStop story Who is winning the GameStop battle? Meet the amateur traders fighting Wall Street In a statement, IG said: ""Due to the recent extreme volatility, and in order to prioritise the service we give our existing clients, we are not allowing any new positions to be opened on the US stocks GameStop and AMC Entertainment. ""These restrictions apply to all IG accounts, and will be reviewed regularly. You will still be able to close any open positions that you have in these stocks. Any orders that you have already placed on these two stocks will remain."" GameStop is a struggling US High Street shop that sells games, consoles and other electronics. Lots of big investment firms, such as hedge funds, had bet on GameStop to lose a lot of value, meaning they borrowed shares in the company and then sold them, with a promise to buy them back at a later date. This is called ""short selling"" or ""shorting"" and the idea is to make money as the share price falls. GameStop - which saw heavy losses last year and was described as ""failing"" by one big investor - is the most shorted stock on Wall Street. But huge numbers of independent amateur traders on social media, including Reddit, swapped tips and bought shares in GameStop. The demand raised its share price massively, leading to losses for the Wall Street traders. And the idea has caught on globally, fuelling activity in stocks traded in other parts of the world, including the UK, Brazil and Malaysia. The strategy has also been deployed on behalf of other firms, such as struggling theatre chain AMC Entertainment, owner of Odeon Cinemas. Publisher Pearson and cinema operator Cineworld have also been the focus of social media discussion, although the share price movements were minimal compared with the GameStop surge. Earlier this week, watchdogs in the US and UK said they were monitoring activity and potential lawbreaking, and warned traders they risked facing huge losses. In a statement on Friday, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority said: ""The FCA is aware of the situation and continues to closely monitor trading in UK markets. UK investors should take care when trading shares in highly volatile market conditions that they fully understand the risks they are taking. This applies to UK investors trading both US and UK stocks. ""Firms and individuals should also ensure they are familiar with, and abiding by, all regulations including the market abuse and short selling regimes in the jurisdiction they are trading in.""

EU backtracks on export controls,"Despite the reversed decision, the EU is introducing export controls on vaccines made in the bloc The EU has reversed its decision to trigger an emergency provision in the Brexit deal to control Covid vaccine exports from the EU. The move could have seen checks at the border of Ireland and Northern Ireland to prevent shipments entering the UK. The Brussels U-turn came hours after it was announced, following condemnation from London, Dublin and Belfast. The plans had been part of the EU's new export controls on vaccines, to combat delivery shortfalls. It is the latest development in a deepening dispute over delays to the production and distribution of Covid vaccines across the EU. What's the problem with the EU's vaccine programme? WHO criticises EU over vaccine export controls Foster urges UK to override part of Brexit deal The Brexit dealguarantees an open border between the EU and Northern Ireland, with no controls on exported products. However, Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol part of the deal allows the EU and UK to choose to suspend any aspects they consider are causing ""economic, societal or environmental difficulties"". On Friday eveningthe EU announcedit would trigger the clause and introduce the export controls on its vaccines entering Northern Ireland in a bid to prevent the region becoming a backdoor for jabs to be sent to the UK mainland. It said the actions were ""justified"" to avert problems caused by a lack of supply. But the proposals sparked concern from Irish Prime Minister MicheÃ¡l Martin as well as all five parties in Northern Ireland's devolved government. Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster described it as ""an absolutely incredible act of hostility"" that created a hard Irish border, while Ireland's Foreign Minister Simon Coveneysaid in a tweet,external: ""The [Northern Ireland] Protocol is not something to be tampered with lightly, it's an essential, hard-won compromise, protecting peace and trade for many."" Later on Friday evening, following talks with UK Prime Minister Boris Johnson, European Commission President Ursula von der Leyentweeted,externalthat the UK and EU had ""agreed on the principle that there should not be restrictions on the export of vaccines by companies where they are fulfilling contractual responsibilities"". She said the backtrack, which was outlined ina European Commission statement,external, came after ""constructive talks"" with Mr Johnson in which he had expressed ""grave concerns"" about the initial plan. The BBC's Brussels correspondent, Kevin Connelly, said Ms von der Leyen's midnight tweet seemed to ""wind down"" the idea that there could be a ""vaccine war"" where jab supplies are prevented from reaching the UK. ""Mistake,"" ""misjudgement,"" ""blunder."" These are just some of words EU insiders have been using privately to describe the European Commission's initial decision on Friday to suspend areas of the Brexit deal dealing with Northern Ireland, a part of its Covid vaccine row. Although it then U-turned on those plans, critics say the damage was already done. Brussels previously lectured the UK government about respecting the Irish Protocol - which was painfully and carefully drafted during Brexit negotiations. Now the EU seemed quick to undermine the agreement. Member state Ireland felt stung that it hadn't been consulted. This all adds to the impression of chaos surrounding the EU's vaccine rollout. Brussels was already under fire from a growing number of EU countries for having been slow to sign vaccine contracts with pharmaceutical companies. This ""mishap"" over the Irish Protocol, as Spain's Foreign Minister called it, hasn't exactly helped the commission's reputation. Julian Smith, Conservative MP and former Northern Ireland secretary, said the EU had ""pulled the emergency cord"" without following the proper processes that had been agreed over years of negotiations. He told BBC Radio 4's Today programme the move came ""without anywhere near the level of understanding of the Good Friday Agreement, of the sensitivities of the situation in Northern Ireland"". ""It was an almost Trumpian act - I'm very pleased that they've changed their minds,"" he said, adding that the EU's ""major issue"" with its Covid vaccine rollout ""does not excuse"" their actions. How many people have had the jab so far? Coronavirus: A year of high-speed discovery Single-dose Johnson & Johnson jab is 66% effective BBC business correspondent Katie Prescottsaid firms in Northern Ireland were stunnedthat the European Commission could trigger a change that was only meant for the ""most egregious circumstances"" - just one month after the UK's post-Brexit transition period with the EU ended. Conservative MP and former international trade secretary, Dr Liam Fox, said the EU had shown it was ""willing to impose [a] hard border on Northern Ireland"" despite the ""precious"" agreements in place to prevent such a situation, with ""very little requirement and no notice"". ""It was like an episode of Carry On at the [European] Commission yesterday, except that it wasn't funny,"" he told BBC News. Mr Martin welcomed the EU's reversal, describing it as a ""positive development given the many challenges we face in tackling Covid-19"". It was not thought that the move would have directly disadvantaged Northern Ireland, which gets its vaccine supplies through the UK procurement system. The Department of Health confirmed Health Secretary Matt Hancock had a ""constructive discussion"" on the supply of vaccines with his Northern Ireland counterpart Robin Swann, whotweeted,externalit was ""essential"" confidence and trust were rebuilt after the EU's actions. The Irish government and its diplomats have spent a huge amount of time and energy educating their EU partners on the nuances of the Irish border. During the Brexit negotiations there was a slick operation where visiting dignitaries and camera crews were whisked up the road from Dublin airport to see the border in County Louth. This paid dividends for Ireland: its concerns remained top of the EU's priorities during the negotiations. Some of the European Commission's most talented officials were deeply involved in the Irish elements of the Brexit deals. But something clearly went badly awry on Friday. The use of the Article 16 mechanism, to override part of the Brexit deal, caught the Irish government by surprise. Those Commission officials with special knowledge of Ireland were either not consulted or not listened to. Dick Roche, Ireland's former Europe minister, told the BBC the government had been ""blindsided"" and ""embarrassed"". He said the Taoiseach had been ""very annoyed"" and made ""very strong representation"" to urge the Commission to change its mind. Despite later backtracking on Article 16, the EU is stillintroducing new controlsgiving its member states the power - should they want to - to block exports of the coronavirus vaccine to countries including the UK, if the company making them has not honoured existing contracts with the EU. The European Commission said the temporary mechanism is to combat ""the current lack of transparency"" over vaccine exports outside the EU, and is not an export ban. But the World Health Organization isamong those criticising the move, saying ""vaccine nationalism"" could prolong the pandemic and further widen global inequality. TESTING:How do I get a virus test?

EU 'fiasco' heaps pressure on Commission,"Will Ursula von der Leyen come under more pressure to resign? ""Misjudgement"", ""mismanagement"", ""blunder""... and words that were far, far stronger. That's what I've been hearing from EU insiders about the European Commission's initial decision on Friday to suspend part of the Brexit deal agreement on Northern Ireland, in its rush to impose restrictions on Covid vaccines, or components of vaccines, exported from the bloc. The EU vaccine roll-out is in very clear trouble. EU countries are openly desperate to get hold of the jabs they have been promised to put in voters' arms. But representatives of member states I've spoken to say they were blindsided by the European Commission move. ""We certainly weren't asked about it,"" one EU diplomat told me. ""If we had been, we would have shouted loudly that it was a terrible idea. The decision was taken, in a hurry, at the top or close to the top [of the Commission]."" Why is EU's vaccine rollout so slow? Even more astonishing, considering the huge sensitivity of the Northern Ireland chapter of the Brexit deal, EU member Ireland wasn't consulted, or even informed, of the Commission's intention. Nor were those in the Commission with intimate knowledge of the post-Brexit Northern Ireland arrangement: former EU lead negotiator Michel Barnier and colleagues. They tried to intervene on Friday evening, urging a swift U-turn on the policy, even as Boris Johnson and the Irish Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin held separate conversations with the European Commission president. Remember just how long and difficult the Brexit negotiations were in reaching an agreement on Northern Ireland? Think about how often the EU lectured the UK government about the importance of respecting the detail of the arrangement; how peace in Northern Ireland was at stake. Yet the impression the European Commission gave on Friday - however incorrect or unintended, which is what it insists - is that those concerns could be thrown aside in a heartbeat. What's happening to the EU vaccine scheme? EU national diplomats, whom I've spoken to over the years as part of my Brexit coverage, appeared frustrated and dismayed. Taoiseach MicheÃ¡l Martin. Ireland wasn't pre-informed of the Commission decision ""Over and again, I've repeated to the press the importance and the fragility of peace in Northern Ireland and how we in the EU appreciated and respected the importance of getting the Brexit deal right,"" a representative from a prominent EU country told me. ""And what do we look like now? This was a disaster. It plays into the hands of EU-haters and UK opponents of the Brexit deal."" Another diplomat questioned whether the team around Commission President Ursula von der Leyen actually understood the Irish protocol in the Brexit deal. ""They came in right at the end. Most of the deal was agreed under [former Commission President Jean-Claude] Juncker. Maybe they just don't get it?"" The European Commission back-tracked late on Friday (although it has reserved the right to revisit the issue, it says, if it sees EU-manufactured vaccines entering the rest of the UK via Northern Ireland). The U-turn was publicly welcomed by MicheÃ¡l Martin. But take a look at political and press reaction in Ireland, Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK, and you'll see a lot of damage had already been done. But Friday's ""Northern Ireland fiasco"" as I've heard it referred to, doesn't feature very prominently in the media elsewhere in Europe. The focus remains on the absence of vaccines, promised by the European Commission, which agreed contracts with pharmaceutical companies on behalf of all its members. There appears to be general dismay at the EU's vaccination programme Here again EU politicians seem increasingly irritated with what is now perceived as incompetence at the highest levels of the Commission. Friday's mess-up over the Brexit Northern Ireland agreement is being described to me as ""a symptom"" of mismanagement of the wider vaccine programme. ""It's like watching a car crash in slow motion,"" one irate EU diplomat told me. ""President von der Leyen is a medical doctor. She wanted to take over the mass purchase of vaccines for all the EU - as a high-profile exercise. Normally health issues are dealt with nationally. This hasn't been a great advertisement for handing over powers to Brussels. I think that's the lesson member states will take away from this."" It should be said that smaller, less well-off EU countries are still relieved the Commission represented them on the vaccine market, otherwise, they say, they'd have found themselves ""at the back of the queue"". There is definite EU-wide anger too at pharmaceutical companies, which have delayed vaccine deliveries. Especially AstraZeneca, which is understood to have promised the EU 100 million doses before the end of March. It has now said it can supply only a fraction of that amount. But by now - when EU governments look at how far ahead the UK and the US are compared to the EU in their vaccine roll-outs - blame is also being directed at Ursula von der Leyen. Some in the EU say privately she may come under pressure to resign. The Commission stands accused of not investing enough in expanding vaccine production sites. And Bavarian leader Markus Soeder - a favourite to replace Angela Merkel as German chancellor - is far from alone when he lashed out at the Commission last week for being ""too late"" in concluding vaccine contracts. AstraZeneca's argument (rejected by the EU) as to why it's honouring its agreement with the UK first, is, it says, because the Johnson government signed on the dotted line three months before Brussels. So now what? The priority for people across the EU is protecting themselves and their families. They were promised a vaccine action-plan they're not - or not yet - getting. Which, in turn, is having an impact on domestic politics. Take the Netherlands or Germany, for example, as they head towards parliamentary elections. Vaccine appointments have been cancelled in France, Portugal, Spain and beyond because of dwindling supplies. The European Commission is under pressure to take effective action. But of late it has given the impression of firing hastily in all directions - threatening AstraZeneca with legal proceedings; demanding some of the company's vaccines be diverted to the EU from production centres in the UK; risking alienating allies in Japan, Canada and Australia with new authorisation requirements for vaccine exports from the EU; and dragging the Brexit deal on Northern Ireland into the fray. None of this, so far, has resulted in reducing the EU's vaccine shortfall. This video can not be played WATCH: Pfizer v Oxford v Moderna â three Covid-19 vaccines compared Of course, not all aspects of the current vaccine debacle are the fault of the Commission. Aside from pharmaceutical company delays, the EMA, the EU's medical regulator, has been slow to approve the use of individual vaccines. Some EU countries have proved more efficient than others with their national roll-out programmes. AstraZeneca and others have promised far larger vaccine supplies for the EU come the spring. Perhaps the EU mood towards the Commission may then soften, but not now, while the health threat from Covid looms large. Covid: Why is EUâs vaccine rollout so slow?

Why is EU's jab rollout so slow?,"Poland's elderly are being vaccinated against Covid-19 Has the European Commission failed EU voters in its all-for-one and one-for-all approach to procuring coronavirus vaccines? Are member countries now regretting they didn't go it alone? As things stand, according to EU sources, the bloc looks sets to receive only a quarter of the 100 million doses it had been expecting from pharma company AstraZeneca by the end of March - putting millions of lives at risk. Vaccine deliveries from another pharma giant, Pfizer, have also slowed down temporarily, while the firm says it's adjusting production methods. Dwindling supplies of coronavirus vaccines have seen Madrid cancelling first dose injections for two weeks. Regional hospitals in Paris say they're in a similar position. They said they're delaying first dose appointments in order to ensure already-vaccinated citizens their second jab. Portugal has warned it could take up to two months longer than initially planned to complete the first phase of its vaccinations. Angela Merkel has scheduled a Monday video conference with Germany's regional leaders and representatives of vaccine manufacturers, after her Health Minister Jens Spahn warned of ""at least another 10 weeks of shortages"". Germany set to limit AstraZeneca jab to under-65s UK vaccine supplies 'won't be interrupted' - Gove What's the problem with the EU's vaccine programme? Charles Michel, the president of the European Council (the man who represents EU countries in Brussels) said on Thursday he hoped delays in vaccine deliveries could be solved. If not, he said he supported the use of ""all legal means and enforcement measures to ensure effective vaccine production and supply for our population"". In the meantime, the EU is trying to get some control over the number of vaccine doses leaving the bloc from pharmaceutical company sites. New powers for EU members to restrict exports of vaccines are expected to be made public later on Friday. AstraZeneca, BioNTech and Pfizer have EU production sites. Moderna completes its vaccines for countries other than the US in Spain, although the vaccine itself is produced in Switzerland, which is not an EU member. Basically, Brussels wants to know if pharmaceutical companies are exporting vaccines or components needed to produce vaccines from EU production sites, in order to fulfil orders elsewhere, when those same companies have delayed supplies to the EU. Officially, Brussels insists it doesn't intend to ban vaccine exports in the future. It claims the new powers for members states are for the purpose of transparency. But the situation is evolving. EU suspicions led it to ask Belgian investigators to inspect a factory - part of the AstraZeneca production chain - this week, to look into the company's claims that the dramatic delay in vaccine supply for the EU was due to production problems. Brussels also asked AstraZeneca whether vaccines produced, or partially produced, in the EU were delivered to the UK. The EU has also demanded the company divert vaccines made at its UK production sites to boost the supply to the EU. In what at first seemed an extremely emotional attack on AstraZeneca, Brussels threw at the company the fact that it had invested more than â¬300m (Â£265m; $364m) to help it develop the vaccine and to produce it in mass quantities. In reality, Brussels has yet to hand over a substantial lump of the promised amount. And some EU accusations just don't add up. Take the complaint that the bloc is being treated as ""second class"" by AstraZeneca. The fact is, when it comes to honouring its contract with the UK, for example, the EU signed its AstraZeneca vaccine contract three months later than Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government. AstraZeneca has also claimed that it has a ""best effort"" agreement with the EU, rather than a 100% commitment that the desired amount of vaccines would be delivered by the end of March. The UK has tried to stay out of the Astra Zeneca row, with the government focusing instead on the content of their contract with the pharmaceutical company. There have been public assurances from cabinet ministers that the UK supply agreed with AstraZeneca will not be affected. That was the really important thing, said UK cabinet office minister, Michael Gove, on Thursday, also adding: ""We will want to talk to and with our friends in Europe to see how we can help."" Some EU figures bridled at comments by Mr Johnson this week that he didn't want to see restrictions on vaccines or their ingredients across borders. They took it as criticism of the discussion in EU circles - originally championed, but later stepped away from, by Germany - of a possible export ban. Post-Brexit, relations are sensitive between the EU and UK - but by Thursday the European Commission was keen to spell out that its beef was with the pharmaceuticals, not with Downing Street. But while there's clearly been bad luck with vaccine supplies so far, the finger of blame has also been pointed squarely - from inside the EU - at the European Commission itself. Brussels had hoped the EU's vaccination procurement scheme would be a beacon of European solidarity and strength. A stark contrast to the ""each country for itself"" impression given off by member states at the start of the pandemic, when EU countries closed off national borders, and Germany and France initially blocked exports of PPE equipment, much needed elsewhere in the bloc. A stark contrast too, according the EU, to the ""vaccine nationalism'"" it believed it saw in the US under President Donald Trump. EU diplomats say the bloc was ""desperate"" to avoid having one EU member state pitted against the other in an ""ugly"" national scramble to secure vaccine contracts for their own populations. But the Commission's ensuing three-pronged attempt to sign a number of contracts with different pharmaceutical companies, at lower prices, ensuring more legal liability on the companies themselves, undoubtedly slowed the process down. The EU is also accused of not investing enough in expanding production capacity. An added complication was the initial suspicion from some member states of the motives of others, such as Germany, France and the Netherlands that are homes to big vaccine producers. Were they keen for the EU to spend more on vaccine procurement, so companies on their soil could benefit? The EU got there in the end with its contracts, amounting to 2.3bn doses, it says, but an online article from Belgium's RTBF describes the current vaccine situation as politically humiliating for the EU, especially after Brexit. It says even though the EU managed to negotiate vaccine contracts as a bloc, even though it played a major role in the research and development of a Covid vaccine, it ultimately failed to achieve ""vaccine sovereignty"". EU defenders say it's a question of perspective and that smaller, less well-off member states are still relieved the EU negotiated on their behalf as they would have probably found themselves far nearer the back of the vaccine queue had they been trying to go it alone. EU officials also make the argument that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has been slower to approve new vaccines in order to be extra sure of their safety. Despite a week of rowing with AstraZeneca, for example, the EU has yet to actually approve the company's vaccine. By contrast, the UK government approved the vaccine a month ago. An EMA announcement is expected on Friday afternoon. Diplomats point to lowering levels of vaccine scepticism amongst the EU public this year, compared with 2020, for example in France, which has a pretty high level of anti-vaxxers. They attribute that to public confidence in the EMA. But EU vaccine problems don't just lie in Brussels. Some member countries have been far more efficient at rolling out the vaccines they have so far received, than others. Denmark is held up as a poster child, for example, whereas Germany's popular Bild newspaper has criticised Angela Merkel's government for being a ""vaccination snail"". And that, coupled with a steadily climbing Covid death toll, has a definite impact on national politics - and EU solidarity. This video can not be played WATCH: Pfizer v Oxford v Moderna â three Covid-19 vaccines compared This is election year in Germany. Under fire for the slow rate of getting vaccines into arms compared with the UK, the German government felt forced to admit it had negotiated a separate vaccine contract with Pfizer back in September. Ms Merkel is obliged to wait with using those additional vaccines until all EU countries have received their allotted doses under the EU-Pfizer contract, but still... Hungary, meanwhile, has agreed to purchase two million doses of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine. Since the EU has no contract with Moscow, Prime Minister Viktor Orban is legally free to start rolling out those jabs whenever he wants. Pharmaceutical companies promised vaccine deliveries to the EU will greatly increase after March - but EU citizens look at the advanced rate of vaccinations in the UK, the US, never mind Israel, and right now the mood is fearful and sceptical. In the initial race to find a vaccine, most countries spoke of the need for fairness. Global pledging conferences emphasised the importance of everyone getting the vaccine, rich or poor; wherever they live. But now vaccines are available and with Covid still a huge health threat, the rush for jabs is proving rather messier than was hoped. At least in the immediate term.

"EU 'made a mistake' over Covid vaccines, Gove saysThe Cabinet Office minister says he is ""confident"" the UK can continue with its planned jabs rollout.UK","This video can not be played Gove: EU didn't consult us or our friends in Dublin before triggering Article 16 The European Union recognised it ""made a mistake"" in triggering an emergency provision in the Brexit deal to control Covid vaccine exports, the Cabinet Office minister has said. Michael Gove said he was ""confident"" of the UK's vaccine supply and said its programme would continue as planned. He said the UK was ""on track"" to deliver 15 million jabs by 15 February. It comes after the EUreversed a decisionwhich could have seen checks at the Irish border amid a vaccine row. Mr Gove said he had spoken with European Commission vice-president MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ and both had agreed ""we need a reset"" and to put the people of Northern Ireland first. EU 'fiasco' on NI heaps pressure on Commission What's the problem with the EU's vaccine programme? WHO criticises EU over vaccine export controls He said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had spoken to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and it was made clear that ""supply would not be interrupted so we can proceed with our plans"". On Friday, the EU said it wouldtrigger Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol- which allows the EU and UK to choose to suspend any aspects they consider are causing ""economic, societal or environmental difficulties"" - before later reversing the decision following condemnation from London, Dublin and Belfast. The Irish Republic's foreign minister, Simon Coveney,said in a tweet,externalthe protocol was a ""hard-won compromise"" and was ""not something to be tampered with lightly"". The move came amid a deepening dispute over delays to the production and distribution of Covid vaccines across the EU. One EU diplomattold BBC Europe editor Katya Adlerthey were not consulted on the move and would have said it was a ""terrible idea"", while another described the EU's vaccination programme as a ""car crash in slow motion"". After speaking with Mr Gove, Mr Å efÄoviÄtweeted,externaltheir shared priority was ensuring the protocol worked for the people of Northern Ireland, ""protecting gains of the peace process and avoiding disruption to everyday lives"". Mr Coveney said hehad also spoken with the pair,external, as well as UK Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis. He said the protocol was there to ""protect relationships, facilitate trade, avoid borders"". A major row has been avoided - and UK ministers are adopting a conciliatory tone. But this situation did something rare in our recent political history - it united politicians from across the Brexit divide in condemnation of the EU. Although Michael Gove is pleased Brussels has stepped back from its plan to introduce controls on the island of Ireland, this could still do political damage. It's unlikely to help with trust between London and Brussels when it comes to implementing the Brexit trade deal. And some think the bar has been lowered for invoking emergency powers in the future. We've already seen some unionist politicians in Northern Ireland saying it should be used by the UK to make sure goods can travel seamlessly between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The UK government said a further 1,200 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus as of Saturday, taking the total deaths by that measure to 105,571. There have been a further 23,275 lab-confirmed cases of the virus in the UK, while 8,378,940 have received their first dose of a vaccine. Mr Gove said the government expected vaccines manufactured by Pfizer and AstraZeneca to be supplied to the UK but said it would work with the EU to ""make sure that their own problems can be tackled"". ""Our first priority is vaccinating people in the United Kingdom, but we also want to work with our friends and neighbours in the European Union in order to help them as well,"" he said. A government spokeswoman said the UK had secured ""more than enough to vaccinate the whole country"", with 30 million doses ofJanssen's jabexpected to begin arriving in the second half of the year, if approved for use by the regulator. There's no doubt the UK is in a much better position than many countries when it comes to vaccines. Although the supply of Pfizer might be disrupted by recent plans to upgrade the company's plant in Belgium (or the row with the EU), the AstraZeneca vaccine is made in the UK and the supply chains are working well. The government has ordered 100 million doses of AstraZeneca, which is why it's so confident it can vaccinate the most vulnerable groups by mid-February. By April, the UK is expected to get access to its first doses of the Moderna vaccine. Then there was good news on Friday when two other vaccines - Novavax and Janssen - were both declared effective by their manufacturers. Like AstraZeneca, Novavax will be made inside the UK and that will mean it won't be subject to any disputes with other countries. With 60 million doses of Novavax on order, it will make up the second biggest tranche of the UK's vaccine supply. It's expected to come on stream in the summer and will help boost plans to vaccinate the bulk of the UK's adult population by the start of the autumn. The EU proposal to trigger Article 16 sparked concern from Irish Prime Minister MicheÃ¡l Martin as well as all five parties in Northern Ireland's devolved government. Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster described it as""an absolutely incredible act of hostility""that created a hard Irish border. TESTING:How do I get a virus test?

"EU 'made a mistake' over Covid vaccines, Gove says","This video can not be played Gove: EU didn't consult us or our friends in Dublin before triggering Article 16 The European Union recognised it ""made a mistake"" in triggering an emergency provision in the Brexit deal to control Covid vaccine exports, the Cabinet Office minister has said. Michael Gove said he was ""confident"" of the UK's vaccine supply and said its programme would continue as planned. He said the UK was ""on track"" to deliver 15 million jabs by 15 February. It comes after the EUreversed a decisionwhich could have seen checks at the Irish border amid a vaccine row. Mr Gove said he had spoken with European Commission vice-president MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ and both had agreed ""we need a reset"" and to put the people of Northern Ireland first. EU 'fiasco' on NI heaps pressure on Commission What's the problem with the EU's vaccine programme? WHO criticises EU over vaccine export controls He said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had spoken to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and it was made clear that ""supply would not be interrupted so we can proceed with our plans"". On Friday, the EU said it wouldtrigger Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol- which allows the EU and UK to choose to suspend any aspects they consider are causing ""economic, societal or environmental difficulties"" - before later reversing the decision following condemnation from London, Dublin and Belfast. The Irish Republic's foreign minister, Simon Coveney,said in a tweet,externalthe protocol was a ""hard-won compromise"" and was ""not something to be tampered with lightly"". The move came amid a deepening dispute over delays to the production and distribution of Covid vaccines across the EU. One EU diplomattold BBC Europe editor Katya Adlerthey were not consulted on the move and would have said it was a ""terrible idea"", while another described the EU's vaccination programme as a ""car crash in slow motion"". After speaking with Mr Gove, Mr Å efÄoviÄtweeted,externaltheir shared priority was ensuring the protocol worked for the people of Northern Ireland, ""protecting gains of the peace process and avoiding disruption to everyday lives"". Mr Coveney said hehad also spoken with the pair,external, as well as UK Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis. He said the protocol was there to ""protect relationships, facilitate trade, avoid borders"". A major row has been avoided - and UK ministers are adopting a conciliatory tone. But this situation did something rare in our recent political history - it united politicians from across the Brexit divide in condemnation of the EU. Although Michael Gove is pleased Brussels has stepped back from its plan to introduce controls on the island of Ireland, this could still do political damage. It's unlikely to help with trust between London and Brussels when it comes to implementing the Brexit trade deal. And some think the bar has been lowered for invoking emergency powers in the future. We've already seen some unionist politicians in Northern Ireland saying it should be used by the UK to make sure goods can travel seamlessly between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The UK government said a further 1,200 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus as of Saturday, taking the total deaths by that measure to 105,571. There have been a further 23,275 lab-confirmed cases of the virus in the UK, while 8,378,940 have received their first dose of a vaccine. Mr Gove said the government expected vaccines manufactured by Pfizer and AstraZeneca to be supplied to the UK but said it would work with the EU to ""make sure that their own problems can be tackled"". ""Our first priority is vaccinating people in the United Kingdom, but we also want to work with our friends and neighbours in the European Union in order to help them as well,"" he said. A government spokeswoman said the UK had secured ""more than enough to vaccinate the whole country"", with 30 million doses ofJanssen's jabexpected to begin arriving in the second half of the year, if approved for use by the regulator. There's no doubt the UK is in a much better position than many countries when it comes to vaccines. Although the supply of Pfizer might be disrupted by recent plans to upgrade the company's plant in Belgium (or the row with the EU), the AstraZeneca vaccine is made in the UK and the supply chains are working well. The government has ordered 100 million doses of AstraZeneca, which is why it's so confident it can vaccinate the most vulnerable groups by mid-February. By April, the UK is expected to get access to its first doses of the Moderna vaccine. Then there was good news on Friday when two other vaccines - Novavax and Janssen - were both declared effective by their manufacturers. Like AstraZeneca, Novavax will be made inside the UK and that will mean it won't be subject to any disputes with other countries. With 60 million doses of Novavax on order, it will make up the second biggest tranche of the UK's vaccine supply. It's expected to come on stream in the summer and will help boost plans to vaccinate the bulk of the UK's adult population by the start of the autumn. The EU proposal to trigger Article 16 sparked concern from Irish Prime Minister MicheÃ¡l Martin as well as all five parties in Northern Ireland's devolved government. Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster described it as""an absolutely incredible act of hostility""that created a hard Irish border. TESTING:How do I get a virus test? SYMPTOMS:What are they and how to guard against them? LOOK-UP TOOL:How many cases in your area? GLOBAL SPREAD:How many worldwide cases are there? Despite later backtracking on Article 16, the EU is stillintroducing new controlsgiving its member states the power - should they want to - to block exports of the coronavirus vaccine to countries including the UK, if the company making them has not honoured existing contracts with the EU. The European Commission said the temporary mechanism is to combat ""the current lack of transparency"" over vaccine exports outside the EU, and is not an export ban. But the World Health Organization isamong those criticising the move, saying ""vaccine nationalism"" could prolong the pandemic and further widen global inequality. Last summer the EU agreed to buy up to 400m doses of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine, and on Friday the EU's drugs regulatorapproved the vaccine's usefor all adults. But the firm said that due to problems at one of its EU factories, supplies would be reduced by about 60% in the first quarter of 2021.

PM urged to replace 'unworkable' NI Brexit deal,"Arlene Foster said the row over vaccine exports was due to the EU's ""vaccine embarrassment"" Arlene Foster has called on Boris Johnson to invoke part of the Brexit agreement to deal with problems in the movement of goods between GB and NI. It comes as the EUreversed its decision to use the same mechanismto control the export of coronavirus vaccines from the EU into NI. Northern Ireland's first minister said the move to trigger Article 16 of the NI Protocol was an ""act of hostility"". Ireland's leader rejected her claim that the protocol is unworkable. However, Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin it was a mistake on the part of the European Commission to signal its intention to trigger Article 16 and lessons would have to be learned. Meanwhile, cabinet office minister Michael Gove saidhe was ""confident"" the UK can now continue its vaccine programmeand is ""on track"" to deliver 15 million jabs by 15 February. Mr Gove said the EU bloc had recognised it ""made a mistake"" in signalling that it might trigger Article 16, which could have seen checks at the Irish border. Michelle O'Neill said the EU had given Brexiteers a rod with which to beat the protocol Earlier, Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the EU had been ""unwise and ill-judged"". Mrs Foster, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), said the EU's move was prompted by what she called its ""vaccine embarrassment"". EU countries are dealing with a big shortfall in vaccines and there was concern the Irish border could be used as a backdoor for supplies entering the UK. The protocol, which is part of the Withdrawal Agreement, is designed to allow the free movement of goods from the EU into NI, and prevent the need for a hard border on the island of Ireland. Mrs Foster urged the prime minister to use Article 16 of the protocol to take immediate action to address trade flow problems between GB and NI, as some businesses grapple with post-Brexit arrangements for importing food products from GB. Amazon prepares to stop selling some products to NI Supply problems for supermarkets being 'overcome' Since 1 January, there has been a new trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK - the so-called Irish Sea border - because Northern Ireland has stayed in the EU single market for goods and enforces EU customs rules at its ports. There have been calls from unionist parties to reduce checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK but the government insists the new arrangements are not creating serious difficulties. The protocol itself was ""unworkable"" and should be replaced, Mrs Foster told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. She added it was based on a ""misunderstanding"" of the Good Friday Agreement, the two-decade-old deal to maintain peace in Northern Ireland. ""This protocol that was meant to bring about peace and harmony in Northern Ireland is doing quite the reverse,"" she said. Last night Stephen Kelly's phone rang off the hook. As chief executive of Manufacturing Northern Ireland his members were clamouring to know what on earth the European Commission's decision meant for their businesses. ""We'd just started to get used to the new regime - and now they want to rip it all up again?"" For business, the decision to trigger Article 16 and subsequent U-turn was a test that delivered a swift result, but raised the spectre of many more. A month on from the Brexit deal and companies were aghast at the prospect that the European Commission could so quickly trigger a change that was only meant for the most egregious circumstances. The Brexit deal and protocol which eliminated the need for a border on the island of Ireland is, businesses feel, vital for maintaining peace and prosperity. Arlene Foster said this morning the protocol isn't working. There are indeed trade issues relating to the implementation of barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, delays, cancellations. But experts say the protocol is doing exactly as it was planned to do - which is ensuring goods can flow friction free across the island of Ireland's border. Ms O'Neill, the Sinn FÃ©in vice-president, said the EU had given ""the Brexiteers a rod to beat the protocol with and that is unfortunate because the protocol is absolutely necessary"". ""There was a lot of attention and effort and dedication put in to protecting the all-island economy,"" she added. What's the problem with the EU's vaccine programme? EU brings in controls on vaccines to NI On Friday night, the European Commissionbacktracked on its plan to invoke Article 16of the Northern Ireland Protocol over the export of vaccines. Triggering the mechanism would have temporarily placed export controls on the movement of vaccines to prevent NI being used as a backdoor to move them from the bloc into the UK. MicheÃ¡l Martin rejected Mrs Foster's claim that the NI protocol is unworkable The clause allows the EU and UK to chose to suspend any aspects they consider are causing ""economic, societal or environmental difficulties"". The Irish government was not consulted on the EU's initial decision to invoke the article. Taoiseach Mr Martin told RTÃ News on Saturday that the EC had made a mistake but that any damage done could be repaired. He said he had spoken to Boris Johnson on Friday night and also had several conversations with President von der Leyen. He said that dialogue would continue to ensure that lessons are learned. Whatever the sequencing and the hard conversation between Dublin and Brussels, political parties in Northern Ireland are already picking through the wreckage to salvage what they can. For Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP and the Alliance Party, it is all about damage limitation and ensuring Brussels has learned lessons from its costly political blunder. For the DUP and Ulster Unionists, the EU's reaction has supercharged their onslaught on the Northern Ireland protocol. They can say that, at the first sign of trouble, Brussels effectively advocated for the same hard land border it had fought years to prevent. It was a political penalty kick for unionists into an open goal. Read more of Enda's analysis here. Parties in Northern Ireland were unanimously opposed to the invocation of Article 16. Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken called it a ""tipping point"". ""The EU cynically and deliberately used Northern Ireland in an attempt to cover up their vaccine omnishambles with a political one,"" he said. ""The EU's actions show that they do not have our best interests at heart."" The SDLP claimed Mrs Foster's position was illogical, with the party's South Belfast Stormont assembly member Matthew O'Toole saying: ""Invoking Article 16 was an indefensible act which has been rectified. ""But the logic at work from Arlene Foster is remarkable: Triggering Article 16 was aggressive and hostile so let's force London to do same?"" Alliance Party MP Stephen Farry said it was something which ""should not have happened"" and that ""trust and confidence now needs to be rebuilt"". Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said ""lessons should be learned"" about the way the matter had been handled. ""The protocol is not something to be tampered with lightly,"" hetweeted,external. ""It's an essential, hard won compromise, protecting peace and trade for many.""

UK trading platform IG stops new GameStop tradesThe move by one of the UK's biggest trading companies comes amid a price war between amateurs and pros.Business,"One of the UK's biggest financial trading platforms, IG, has stopped any new trades in GameStop and theatre chain AMC when markets open on Monday. US video games retailer GameStop is the focus of a trading war between amateurs and Wall Street pros. Both GameStop and AMC Entertainment have seen their share prices boom as amateur investors, fuelled by chat on social media, bought their shares. In a statement IG said the restrictions will be reviewed regularly. This video can not be played WATCH: What's been going on at GameStop? Other popular stock market trading apps also temporarily halted dealings in GameStop on Thursday, after its shares soared as much as 700% in the past week. AMC Entertainment and Blackberry, which have also seen huge trading activity, were among the other companies hit by the trading restrictions. But the move left investors outraged, accusing the trading platforms of working on behalf of traditional Wall Street investors who were losing out. Several platforms then rowed back on their stance. Simple guide to the GameStop story Who is winning the GameStop battle? Meet the amateur traders fighting Wall Street In a statement, IG said: ""Due to the recent extreme volatility, and in order to prioritise the service we give our existing clients, we are not allowing any new positions to be opened on the US stocks GameStop and AMC Entertainment. ""These restrictions apply to all IG accounts, and will be reviewed regularly. You will still be able to close any open positions that you have in these stocks. Any orders that you have already placed on these two stocks will remain."" GameStop is a struggling US High Street shop that sells games, consoles and other electronics. Lots of big investment firms, such as hedge funds, had bet on GameStop to lose a lot of value, meaning they borrowed shares in the company and then sold them, with a promise to buy them back at a later date. This is called ""short selling"" or ""shorting"" and the idea is to make money as the share price falls. GameStop - which saw heavy losses last year and was described as ""failing"" by one big investor - is the most shorted stock on Wall Street. But huge numbers of independent amateur traders on social media, including Reddit, swapped tips and bought shares in GameStop. The demand raised its share price massively, leading to losses for the Wall Street traders. And the idea has caught on globally, fuelling activity in stocks traded in other parts of the world, including the UK, Brazil and Malaysia. The strategy has also been deployed on behalf of other firms, such as struggling theatre chain AMC Entertainment, owner of Odeon Cinemas. Publisher Pearson and cinema operator Cineworld have also been the focus of social media discussion, although the share price movements were minimal compared with the GameStop surge. Earlier this week, watchdogs in the US and UK said they were monitoring activity and potential lawbreaking, and warned traders they risked facing huge losses. In a statement on Friday, the UK's Financial Conduct Authority said: ""The FCA is aware of the situation and continues to closely monitor trading in UK markets. UK investors should take care when trading shares in highly volatile market conditions that they fully understand the risks they are taking. This applies to UK investors trading both US and UK stocks. ""Firms and individuals should also ensure they are familiar with, and abiding by, all regulations including the market abuse and short selling regimes in the jurisdiction they are trading in.""

Pakistan has secured 17 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine through an international scheme called Covax, a government health advisor says. About six million of the doses will arrive in the first quarter of 2021 and the remainder by the middle of the year, Faisal Sultan, special assistant to the Prime Minister on national health services, tweeted. Covaxstands for Covid-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility. It's aimed at making sure vaccines are shared fairly among 180 countries, rich and poor. The scheme is led by the World Health Organization (WHO), together with the Global Vaccine Alliance and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations. Highlighting current inequalities,the WHO's head, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, says more than 39 million doses had been administered in at least 49 higher-income countries, but only 25 in one of the lowest-income countries. WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris says once countries had vaccinated their top nine priority groups, they should help efforts elsewhere instead of continuing their own immunisations, This is morally and economically ""the right thing to do"", she told BBC Breakfast earlier. As we've been reporting, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove says the EU has ""taken a step back"" after reversing its decision to reimpose a border in Northern Ireland. ""They did not consult us, they didn't consult our friends in Dublin and the united parties in Northern Ireland, from Sinn Fein on one side to the DUP on the other, are in condemnation. People in Northern Ireland were bewildered by this step,"" he says. You can watch his comments in full here. This video can not be played Naomi GrimleyBBC News Thereâs no
doubt the UK is in a much better position than many countries when it comes to
vaccines. Although the supply of Pfizer might be disrupted by recent plans to
upgrade the companyâs plant in Belgium (or the row with the EU), the
AstraZeneca vaccine is made in the UK and the supply chains are working well.
The government has ordered 100m doses of AstraZeneca which is why itâs so
confident it can vaccinate the most vulnerable groups by mid-Feb. By April, the
UK is expected to get access to its first doses of the Moderna vaccine. Then
there was good news yesterday when two other products â Novavax and Johnson and
Johnson â were both declared effective by their manufacturers. Like
AstraZeneca, Novavax will be made inside the UK and that will mean it wonât be
subject to any disputes with other countries. With 60 million doses of Novavax
on order, it will make up the second biggest tranche of the UKâs vaccine
supply. Itâs expected to come on stream in the summer and will help boost plans
to vaccinate the bulk of the UKâs adult population by the start of the autumn. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove says the EU has agreed a ""reset"" on relations with Northern Ireland is needed. On Friday, the EU reversed its decision to trigger Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol - which allows the EU and UK to choose to suspend any aspects they consider are causing ""economic, societal or environmental difficulties"" - following condemnation from London, Dublin and Belfast. The move came amid a deepening dispute over delays to the production and distribution of Covid vaccines across the EU. Gove says: ""I think the European Union recognises that they made a mistake in triggering Article 16 which would've meant the reimposition of a border on the island of Ireland. ""But now the European Union has stepped back. ""I've spoken to the European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic about this and we both agreed that we need a reset, that we need to put the people of Northern Ireland first."" Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has said the EU has recognised it ""made a mistake"" after reversing an emergency clause in the Brexit deal to control Covid vaccine exports. And he says he is ""confident"" the UK is ""on track"" to deliver 15 million jabs by 15 February. ""Last night the Prime Minister talked to President von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission, and made clear that we need to have the contracts that have been entered into honoured properly"", he said. ""And it was made clear that that supply would not be interrupted so we can proceed with our plans and make sure that our so far highly-successful vaccination programme can continue."" A further 23,275 coronavirus cases have been recorded in the UK,according to government data.,external That's down on yesterday's figure of 29,079 positive tests. The number of deaths recorded today - 1,200 is only slightly lower than Friday's total of 1,245. The number of people who have received their first vaccine is 8,378,940 and 480,432 people have received their second dose. A further 1,200 people have died with coronavirus in the UK,according to the government's daily figures.,external This takes the total number of people to die within 28 days of a positive test to 105,571.

The BBC introduced Jacqui, who gave birth during the first lockdown, to Gemma, who is pregnant now - to offer advice and support, from one mother to another. Around 130,000 people who are clinically extremely vulnerable to the coronavirus are being asked to keep shielding in Wales until the end of March. The group - many of whom have underlying health conditions - were originally advised to stay at home and isolate from others during the first wave last year. This was paused in August, but resumed before Christmas amid a rise in cases linked to the new virus variant. The Welsh Government has extended the current shielding period from 7 February until 31 March. Guidance for those shielding elsewhere in the UK has yet to be updated. All those deemed clinically extremely vulnerable are treated as a priority for the UK's vaccination programme. Read morehere. France is imposing new border restrictions from tomorrow to slow the spread of coronavirus and the import of new variants. All but essential travel from outside the EU will be banned and testing requirements on travellers from within the EU will be tightened. So what's happening in other countries? From Saturday,Germanyhas banned most travellers from countries hit hard by new variants. The countries are the UK, Ireland, Portugal, Brazil, South Africa, Lesotho and Eswatini. The move is expected to last until 17 February. Also from Saturday, theCzech Republichas banned non-essential entry into the country, again to try to curb the new variants. Portugalon Thursday banned non-essential overseas travel by air, land or sea for its citizens for a fortnight. Belgiumon Wednesday banned non-essential trips out of the country until 1 March. In contrast,Italysaid on Friday it would move more areas into less-restrictive rules from Monday, despite health officials warning it was risky. No areas would be classified as ""red"", which brings tough travel and business restrictions.Read more here.

Sixteen people were fined Â£800 each at a Plymouth house party on Saturday morning by Devon and Cornwall Police. Sgt Dan Brenchley said the party was an example of a ""small minority"" who were ""continually flouting"" lockdown rules. The new Â£800 penalty is a Â£600 increase on the previous fine for big indoor groups. The penalty for attending illegal indoor gatherings of 15 or fewer people remains Â£200, while fines of up to Â£10,000 for holding large illegal gatherings of over 30 people still only apply to organisers.

Video calls - from TV interviews to work meetings - have given us all an insight into other people's homes. And, for one company that sells books in Somerset, that's provided a very unexpected boost. Miriam BarkerBBC News This video can not be played Sianny Thomas, 34, has Inflammatory Bowel Disease and believes many councils did not consider people like her before closing some public toilets during the pandemic. ""It can be so debilitating. It's a horrible feeling, needing the toilet and not being able to go,"" she said. ""Conditions like mine are exasperated by stress, and it's a spiral for people, when they get stressed the condition worsens and they deteriorate, knowing the toilets were open would give people a lot of relief."" It can also be a problem for homeless people and parents with young children, Sianny added. Richard Edwards, chief executive of rough sleepers charity Huggard, said public safety came first and keeping toilets open during the pandemic was difficult but he said the current stay-at-home order ""ignores the fact that too many people don't have a home"". ""Without public toilets or other accessible facilities, people who find themselves sleeping rough have no alternative but to relieve themselves in the street,"" he said. ""This is personally degrading and socially unacceptable."" Read more here. Joelinton shared a picture of himself in Tom Baxter's salon on Friday A barber to the stars has called a Premier League ace an ""idiot"" for sharing a photo of himself getting anillegal lockdown haircut. Stylist Tom Baxter cut Newcastle United forward Joelinton's hair on Friday, but the Brazilian forward shared a photograph of the moment on Instagram. The crimper says it was obvious many footballers were getting professional cuts done, adding that if ""I didn't do it someone else would"". He does, however, accept he ""is not above the law"" regardingCovid rules,external. Mr Baxter says Joelinton's visit was part of a photoshoot which could be allowed under the rules, although the stylist said he ""should not have"" cut his hair and Joelinton was an ""idiot"" for putting it on social media. He says he is expecting a visit from the police and will ""accept what's handed down to me"". Students at Columbia University in the US are withholding tuition fees for the spring semester and refusing to pay for remote learning during the pandemic in the face of what they say are steep costs, US media report. They want the Ivy League university to lower its prices along with other changes. Some 1,000 students have pledged not to pay tuition, according to the group that organised the protest. In a letter,externalto the presidents, trustees and administrators of Columbia University, Barnard College and Teachers College, they demanded that the university ""alleviate the economic burden on students"" by decreasing tuition by at least 10% and increasing financial aid by at least 10%. The Columbia-Barnard chapter of the Young Democratic Socialists of America (YDSA) began organising the strike in October, and said students began withholding tuition on Friday of last week when payments were due, reports say. Tuition for undergraduates for an academic year are close to $60,000 (Â£44,000). Health bosses have apologised after some clinically extremely vulnerable children were mistakenly sent letters inviting them for a Covid vaccination. In the UK, no-one under the age of 16 has been advised to have a vaccine yet. But Nottingham and Nottinghamshire Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) said a ""processing error"" meant the letter was sent to children. A statement said: ""We are extremely sorry for this mix-up"" and told anyone who received the letter toignore it. So who should be getting vaccinated? The jabs are being given to the most vulnerable first, with a list of nine high-priority groups being followed. You can read more details about thathere. Â© 2025 BBC.

"Gove 'confident' of UK vaccine supply after EU rowHe says the EU recognised it had ""made a mistake"" after invoking an emergency provision in the Brexit deal.","This video can not be played Gove: EU didn't consult us or our friends in Dublin before triggering Article 16 The European Union recognised it ""made a mistake"" in triggering an emergency provision in the Brexit deal to control Covid vaccine exports, the Cabinet Office minister has said. Michael Gove said he was ""confident"" of the UK's vaccine supply and said its programme would continue as planned. He said the UK was ""on track"" to deliver 15 million jabs by 15 February. It comes after the EUreversed a decisionwhich could have seen checks at the Irish border amid a vaccine row. Mr Gove said he had spoken with European Commission vice-president MaroÅ¡ Å efÄoviÄ and both had agreed ""we need a reset"" and to put the people of Northern Ireland first. EU 'fiasco' on NI heaps pressure on Commission What's the problem with the EU's vaccine programme? WHO criticises EU over vaccine export controls He said Prime Minister Boris Johnson had spoken to European Commission President Ursula von der Leyen and it was made clear that ""supply would not be interrupted so we can proceed with our plans"". On Friday, the EU said it wouldtrigger Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol- which allows the EU and UK to choose to suspend any aspects they consider are causing ""economic, societal or environmental difficulties"" - before later reversing the decision following condemnation from London, Dublin and Belfast. The Irish Republic's foreign minister, Simon Coveney,said in a tweet,externalthe protocol was a ""hard-won compromise"" and was ""not something to be tampered with lightly"". The move came amid a deepening dispute over delays to the production and distribution of Covid vaccines across the EU. One EU diplomattold BBC Europe editor Katya Adlerthey were not consulted on the move and would have said it was a ""terrible idea"", while another described the EU's vaccination programme as a ""car crash in slow motion"". After speaking with Mr Gove, Mr Å efÄoviÄtweeted,externaltheir shared priority was ensuring the protocol worked for the people of Northern Ireland, ""protecting gains of the peace process and avoiding disruption to everyday lives"". Mr Coveney said hehad also spoken with the pair,external, as well as UK Northern Ireland Secretary Brandon Lewis. He said the protocol was there to ""protect relationships, facilitate trade, avoid borders"". A major row has been avoided - and UK ministers are adopting a conciliatory tone. But this situation did something rare in our recent political history - it united politicians from across the Brexit divide in condemnation of the EU. Although Michael Gove is pleased Brussels has stepped back from its plan to introduce controls on the island of Ireland, this could still do political damage. It's unlikely to help with trust between London and Brussels when it comes to implementing the Brexit trade deal. And some think the bar has been lowered for invoking emergency powers in the future. We've already seen some unionist politicians in Northern Ireland saying it should be used by the UK to make sure goods can travel seamlessly between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. The UK government said a further 1,200 people had died within 28 days of testing positive for coronavirus as of Saturday, taking the total deaths by that measure to 105,571. There have been a further 23,275 lab-confirmed cases of the virus in the UK, while 8,378,940 have received their first dose of a vaccine. Mr Gove said the government expected vaccines manufactured by Pfizer and AstraZeneca to be supplied to the UK but said it would work with the EU to ""make sure that their own problems can be tackled"". ""Our first priority is vaccinating people in the United Kingdom, but we also want to work with our friends and neighbours in the European Union in order to help them as well,"" he said. A government spokeswoman said the UK had secured ""more than enough to vaccinate the whole country"", with 30 million doses ofJanssen's jabexpected to begin arriving in the second half of the year, if approved for use by the regulator. There's no doubt the UK is in a much better position than many countries when it comes to vaccines. Although the supply of Pfizer might be disrupted by recent plans to upgrade the company's plant in Belgium (or the row with the EU), the AstraZeneca vaccine is made in the UK and the supply chains are working well. The government has ordered 100 million doses of AstraZeneca, which is why it's so confident it can vaccinate the most vulnerable groups by mid-February. By April, the UK is expected to get access to its first doses of the Moderna vaccine. Then there was good news on Friday when two other vaccines - Novavax and Janssen - were both declared effective by their manufacturers. Like AstraZeneca, Novavax will be made inside the UK and that will mean it won't be subject to any disputes with other countries. With 60 million doses of Novavax on order, it will make up the second biggest tranche of the UK's vaccine supply. It's expected to come on stream in the summer and will help boost plans to vaccinate the bulk of the UK's adult population by the start of the autumn. The EU proposal to trigger Article 16 sparked concern from Irish Prime Minister MicheÃ¡l Martin as well as all five parties in Northern Ireland's devolved government. Northern Ireland First Minister Arlene Foster described it as""an absolutely incredible act of hostility""that created a hard Irish border. TESTING:How do I get a virus test?

Footballer 'an idiot' for posting haircut photoNewcastle United striker Joelinton posted a picture of himself in Tom Baxter's salon on Instagram.Tyne & Wear,"Joelinton shared a picture of himself with Tom Baxter on Friday A barber to the stars has called a Premier League ace an ""idiot"" for sharing a photo of an illegal haircut.

The devastating toll of the pandemic on children,"They are not likely to get seriously ill with Covid and there have been very few deaths. But children are still the victims of the virus - and our response to it - in many other ways. From increasing rates of mental health problems to concerns about rising levels of abuse and neglect and the potential harm being done to the development of babies, the pandemic is threatening to have a devastating legacy on the nation's young. The closure of schools is, of course, damaging to children's education. But schools are not just a place for learning. They are places where kids socialise, develop emotionally and, for some, a refuge from troubled family life. Prof Russell Viner, president of the Royal College of Paediatrics and Child Health, perhaps put it most clearly when he told MPs on the Education Select Committee earlier this month: ""When we close schools we close their lives."" He says the pandemic has caused a range of harms to children across the board from being isolated and lonely to suffering from sleep problems andreduced physical activity - alongside school closures all children's sport is currently banned as it has been at various points during the pandemic. The only exception is for organised outdoor sport for the under 12s in Scotland. Many experts are baffled by the approach to children's sport given the low risks of transmission outdoors and the clear benefits for emotional and physical wellbeing - the UK has some of the highest rates of child obesity in the world. But it's not just the closure of schools. The stress the pandemic has put on families, with rising levels of unemployment and financial insecurity combined with the stay-at-home orders, has put strain on home life up and down the land. The NSPCC says the amount of counselling for loneliness provided by its Childline service has risen by 10% since the pandemic started. Neil Homer, who has been volunteering for the service since 2009, has never known anything like it. ""It's had a devastating impact,"" he says. The experience of this 16-year-old is typical of the calls that come in. ""I feel really sad and lonely. Most days I find myself just lost in my own thoughts and feeling numb."" Unsurprisingly, there are clear signs the upheaval in children's lives is having an impact on children's mental health. The Mental Health of Children and Young People in England 2020 report,external, which is produced by NHS Digital and the Office for National Statistics, is the official stocktake of the state of children's well-being. It has been tracking more than 3,000 young people over the last four years. Its latest findings, published in the autumn, found overall one in six children aged five to 16 had a probable mental health disorder, up from one in nine three years previously. Older girls had the highest rates. Children involved in the research cited family tensions and financial concerns as well as feeling isolated from friends and fear about the virus for causing their distress. Older teenagers and adolescents have been affected too as they have seen their prospects shrink. The Youth Index,published in January by the Prince's Trust in partnership with YouGov,external, has been tracking the well-being of young people aged 16 to 25 for 12 years. It found more than half of young people were always or often feeling anxious - the highest level ever recorded. Jonathan Townsend, of The Prince's Trust, fears young people are ""losing all hope for their future"". At the opposite end of the age spectrum, health visitors, who support parents and babies during the early years, are worried about the impact on newborns. Research shows the first two to three years of a baby's life is the most crucial period of human development. This has become known as the 1,001 days agenda. If children fall behind, they can find themselves at a lifelong disadvantage. The Institute of Health Visiting says services have been badly hit during the pandemic with these specialist nurses pulled away from their duties to help out on the Covid front line. In some areas, health visitor numbers have dropped by half. This and the social distancing rules mean for a lot of parents the only support they have received has been online. Meanwhile, the absence of baby and parent groups, and the friendships that naturally develop from them, has meant the babies of the pandemic have not benefited from the stimulus of social contact that is vital to their development. Alison Morton, head of the Institute of Health Visiting, says this has been an ""invisible"" cost of the pandemic, but one that will have a lasting impact, particularly in the most deprived areas. Babies and children, she says, are being ""harmed"" by what she says is the secondary indirect impact of the virus. There are around one million children with special educational needs and disabilities - around one in 10 of whom have complex and life-limiting conditions, such as severe cerebral palsy or cystic fibrosis. The nature of the pandemic and the response to it have created even greater challenges for many of these children and their families. Those with the most complex conditions can require care at home from specialist nurses and carers. This has become harder to obtain as staff have been redeployed or charities forced to cut back on their support networks. For those with compromised immune systems, shielding has been a constant almost throughout. Dame Christine Lenehan, director of the Council for Disabled Children, says in some cases children have ended up ""incarcerated"" in their homes. ""There are some who have barely had any formal education since lockdown began."" She says even those who are the most independent have struggled, with many schools - she estimates more than half - unable to address the additional learning needs of children with special needs who are learning remotely. For some children, the pandemic has had dire consequences with the numbers being harmed and abused on the rise. Between April and Septemberthere were 285 reports by councils of child deaths and incidents of serious harm,external, which includes child sexual exploitation. This was a rise of more than a quarter on the same period the year before. But children's commissioner for England, Anne Longfield, is worried this is just the tip of the iceberg, arguing the lockdowns, closure of schools and stay-at-home orders have led to a generation of vulnerable children becoming ""invisible"" to social workers. Referrals that would normally come in from a variety of sources, form health visitors to school nurses, dropped last year. This, she says, makes no sense given the impact of the pandemic on family life. Figures show that before the pandemic there were already more than two million children in England and Wales living in households affected by one of the ""toxic trio"" - domestic abuse, parental drug and alcohol dependency or severe mental health issues. The fear is this will have risen significantly. The governments across the UK, of course, maintain they have prioritised children. Investment has been made in mental health services and schools are being prioritised as the first thing to open once lockdown starts to lift. But is this enough? Research by Ms Longfield's organisation shows only one in three children who needed mental health support was getting it before the pandemic - and she believes that will now be even worse given the impact of the pandemic on both services and mental health. She warns that children will be living with the legacy of the pandemic for ""years to come"", particularly those from disadvantaged communities, and wants to see a major investment in support for children. Sunil Bhopal, an expert in child health at Newcastle University, agrees. He says too many people dismiss the impact on children, claiming they are ""resilient"" and will ""bounce back"". He believes this is misguided and instead growing up in a world where even ""playing with your friends is illegal"" threatens to cause long-lasting damage to many. ""I don't think it is an exaggeration to say children and their families have been abandoned.""

Foster calls for UK to override part of Brexit deal,"Arlene Foster said the row over vaccine exports was due to the EU's ""vaccine embarrassment"" Arlene Foster has called on Boris Johnson to invoke part of the Brexit agreement to deal with problems in the movement of goods between GB and NI. It comes as the EUreversed its decision to use the same mechanismto control the export of coronavirus vaccines from the EU into NI. Northern Ireland's first minister said the move to trigger Article 16 of the NI Protocol was an ""act of hostility"". Ireland's leader rejected her claim that the protocol is unworkable. However, Taoiseach (Irish Prime Minister) MicheÃ¡l Martin it was a mistake on the part of the European Commission to signal its intention to trigger Article 16 and lessons would have to be learned. Meanwhile, cabinet office minister Michael Gove saidhe was ""confident"" the UK can now continue its vaccine programmeand is ""on track"" to deliver 15 million jabs by 15 February. Mr Gove said the EU bloc had recognised it ""made a mistake"" in signalling that it might trigger Article 16, which could have seen checks at the Irish border. Michelle O'Neill said the EU had given Brexiteers a rod with which to beat the protocol Earlier, Northern Ireland Deputy First Minister Michelle O'Neill said the EU had been ""unwise and ill-judged"". Mrs Foster, the leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP), said the EU's move was prompted by what she called its ""vaccine embarrassment"". EU countries are dealing with a big shortfall in vaccines and there was concern the Irish border could be used as a backdoor for supplies entering the UK. The protocol, which is part of the Withdrawal Agreement, is designed to allow the free movement of goods from the EU into NI, and prevent the need for a hard border on the island of Ireland. Mrs Foster urged the prime minister to use Article 16 of the protocol to take immediate action to address trade flow problems between GB and NI, as some businesses grapple with post-Brexit arrangements for importing food products from GB. Amazon prepares to stop selling some products to NI Supply problems for supermarkets being 'overcome' Since 1 January, there has been a new trade border between Northern Ireland and the rest of the UK - the so-called Irish Sea border - because Northern Ireland has stayed in the EU single market for goods and enforces EU customs rules at its ports. There have been calls from unionist parties to reduce checks on goods entering Northern Ireland from the rest of the UK but the government insists the new arrangements are not creating serious difficulties. The protocol itself was ""unworkable"" and should be replaced, Mrs Foster told BBC Radio 4's Today programme. She added it was based on a ""misunderstanding"" of the Good Friday Agreement, the two-decade-old deal to maintain peace in Northern Ireland. ""This protocol that was meant to bring about peace and harmony in Northern Ireland is doing quite the reverse,"" she said. Last night Stephen Kelly's phone rang off the hook. As chief executive of Manufacturing Northern Ireland his members were clamouring to know what on earth the European Commission's decision meant for their businesses. ""We'd just started to get used to the new regime - and now they want to rip it all up again?"" For business, the decision to trigger Article 16 and subsequent U-turn was a test that delivered a swift result, but raised the spectre of many more. A month on from the Brexit deal and companies were aghast at the prospect that the European Commission could so quickly trigger a change that was only meant for the most egregious circumstances. The Brexit deal and protocol which eliminated the need for a border on the island of Ireland is, businesses feel, vital for maintaining peace and prosperity. Arlene Foster said this morning the protocol isn't working. There are indeed trade issues relating to the implementation of barriers between Great Britain and Northern Ireland, delays, cancellations. But experts say the protocol is doing exactly as it was planned to do - which is ensuring goods can flow friction free across the island of Ireland's border. Ms O'Neill, the Sinn FÃ©in vice-president, said the EU had given ""the Brexiteers a rod to beat the protocol with and that is unfortunate because the protocol is absolutely necessary"". ""There was a lot of attention and effort and dedication put in to protecting the all-island economy,"" she added. What's the problem with the EU's vaccine programme? EU brings in controls on vaccines to NI On Friday night, the European Commissionbacktracked on its plan to invoke Article 16of the Northern Ireland Protocol over the export of vaccines. Triggering the mechanism would have temporarily placed export controls on the movement of vaccines to prevent NI being used as a backdoor to move them from the bloc into the UK. MicheÃ¡l Martin rejected Mrs Foster's claim that the NI protocol is unworkable The clause allows the EU and UK to chose to suspend any aspects they consider are causing ""economic, societal or environmental difficulties"". The Irish government was not consulted on the EU's initial decision to invoke the article. Taoiseach Mr Martin told RTÃ News on Saturday that the EC had made a mistake but that any damage done could be repaired. He said he had spoken to Boris Johnson on Friday night and also had several conversations with President von der Leyen. He said that dialogue would continue to ensure that lessons are learned. Whatever the sequencing and the hard conversation between Dublin and Brussels, political parties in Northern Ireland are already picking through the wreckage to salvage what they can. For Sinn FÃ©in, the SDLP and the Alliance Party, it is all about damage limitation and ensuring Brussels has learned lessons from its costly political blunder. For the DUP and Ulster Unionists, the EU's reaction has supercharged their onslaught on the Northern Ireland protocol. They can say that, at the first sign of trouble, Brussels effectively advocated for the same hard land border it had fought years to prevent. It was a political penalty kick for unionists into an open goal. Read more of Enda's analysis here. Parties in Northern Ireland were unanimously opposed to the invocation of Article 16. Ulster Unionist Party leader Steve Aiken called it a ""tipping point"". ""The EU cynically and deliberately used Northern Ireland in an attempt to cover up their vaccine omnishambles with a political one,"" he said. ""The EU's actions show that they do not have our best interests at heart."" The SDLP claimed Mrs Foster's position was illogical, with the party's South Belfast Stormont assembly member Matthew O'Toole saying: ""Invoking Article 16 was an indefensible act which has been rectified. ""But the logic at work from Arlene Foster is remarkable: Triggering Article 16 was aggressive and hostile so let's force London to do same?"" Alliance Party MP Stephen Farry said it was something which ""should not have happened"" and that ""trust and confidence now needs to be rebuilt"". Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said ""lessons should be learned"" about the way the matter had been handled. ""The protocol is not something to be tampered with lightly,"" hetweeted,external.

Thanks for joining us - we'll be back with more coverage tomorrow. In the meantime, you can find any major news lines on our main news pageshere.  Nick EardleyPolitical correspondent A major row has been avoided - and UK
ministers are adopting a conciliatory tone. But this situation did something rare in our
recent political history - it united politicians from across the Brexit divide
in condemnation of the EU. Although Michael Gove is pleased Brussels
has stepped back from its plan to introduce controls on the island of Ireland,
this could still do political damage. It's unlikely to help with trust between
London and Brussels when it comes to implementing the Brexit trade deal. And some think the bar has been lowered for
invoking emergency powers in the future. Weâve already seen some unionist
politicians in Northern Ireland saying it should be used by the UK to make sure
goods can travel seamlessly between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. European Commission vice-president Marcos Sefcovic and UK Cabinet Minister Michael Gove have both shared a joint message following their call earlier today. Their identical tweets says both sides are ""committed to redoubling our efforts to addressing outstanding issues"" following a row about the Irish border and vaccine supplies.

Pakistan has secured 17 million doses of the AstraZeneca vaccine through an international scheme called Covax, a government health advisor says. About six million of the doses will arrive in the first quarter of 2021 and the remainder by the middle of the year, Faisal Sultan, special assistant to the Prime Minister on national health services, tweeted. Covaxstands for Covid-19 Vaccines Global Access Facility. It's aimed at making sure vaccines are shared fairly among 180 countries, rich and poor. The scheme is led by the World Health Organization (WHO), together with the Global Vaccine Alliance and the Coalition for Epidemic Preparedness Innovations. Highlighting current inequalities,the WHO's head, Tedros Adhanom Ghebreyesus, says more than 39 million doses had been administered in at least 49 higher-income countries, but only 25 in one of the lowest-income countries. WHO spokeswoman Margaret Harris says once countries had vaccinated their top nine priority groups, they should help efforts elsewhere instead of continuing their own immunisations, This is morally and economically ""the right thing to do"", she told BBC Breakfast earlier. As we've been reporting, Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove says the EU has ""taken a step back"" after reversing its decision to reimpose a border in Northern Ireland. ""They did not consult us, they didn't consult our friends in Dublin and the united parties in Northern Ireland, from Sinn Fein on one side to the DUP on the other, are in condemnation. People in Northern Ireland were bewildered by this step,"" he says. You can watch his comments in full here. This video can not be played Naomi GrimleyBBC News Thereâs no
doubt the UK is in a much better position than many countries when it comes to
vaccines. Although the supply of Pfizer might be disrupted by recent plans to
upgrade the companyâs plant in Belgium (or the row with the EU), the
AstraZeneca vaccine is made in the UK and the supply chains are working well.
The government has ordered 100m doses of AstraZeneca which is why itâs so
confident it can vaccinate the most vulnerable groups by mid-Feb. By April, the
UK is expected to get access to its first doses of the Moderna vaccine. Then
there was good news yesterday when two other products â Novavax and Johnson and
Johnson â were both declared effective by their manufacturers. Like
AstraZeneca, Novavax will be made inside the UK and that will mean it wonât be
subject to any disputes with other countries. With 60 million doses of Novavax
on order, it will make up the second biggest tranche of the UKâs vaccine
supply. Itâs expected to come on stream in the summer and will help boost plans
to vaccinate the bulk of the UKâs adult population by the start of the autumn. Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove says the EU has agreed a ""reset"" on relations with Northern Ireland is needed. On Friday, the EU reversed its decision to trigger Article 16 of the Northern Ireland Protocol - which allows the EU and UK to choose to suspend any aspects they consider are causing ""economic, societal or environmental difficulties"" - following condemnation from London, Dublin and Belfast. The move came amid a deepening dispute over delays to the production and distribution of Covid vaccines across the EU. Gove says: ""I think the European Union recognises that they made a mistake in triggering Article 16 which would've meant the reimposition of a border on the island of Ireland. ""But now the European Union has stepped back. ""I've spoken to the European Commission vice-president Maros Sefcovic about this and we both agreed that we need a reset, that we need to put the people of Northern Ireland first."" Cabinet Office minister Michael Gove has said the EU has recognised it ""made a mistake"" after reversing an emergency clause in the Brexit deal to control Covid vaccine exports. And he says he is ""confident"" the UK is ""on track"" to deliver 15 million jabs by 15 February. ""Last night the Prime Minister talked to President von der Leyen, the President of the European Commission, and made clear that we need to have the contracts that have been entered into honoured properly"", he said. ""And it was made clear that that supply would not be interrupted so we can proceed with our plans and make sure that our so far highly-successful vaccination programme can continue."" A further 23,275 coronavirus cases have been recorded in the UK,according to government data.,external That's down on yesterday's figure of 29,079 positive tests. The number of deaths recorded today - 1,200 is only slightly lower than Friday's total of 1,245. The number of people who have received their first vaccine is 8,378,940 and 480,432 people have received their second dose. A further 1,200 people have died with coronavirus in the UK,according to the government's daily figures.,external This takes the total number of people to die within 28 days of a positive test to 105,571.

The BBC introduced Jacqui, who gave birth during the first lockdown, to Gemma, who is pregnant now - to offer advice and support, from one mother to another. Around 130,000 people who are clinically extremely vulnerable to the coronavirus are being asked to keep shielding in Wales until the end of March. The group - many of whom have underlying health conditions - were originally advised to stay at home and isolate from others during the first wave last year. This was paused in August, but resumed before Christmas amid a rise in cases linked to the new virus variant. The Welsh Government has extended the current shielding period from 7 February until 31 March. Guidance for those shielding elsewhere in the UK has yet to be updated. All those deemed clinically extremely vulnerable are treated as a priority for the UK's vaccination programme. Read morehere. France is imposing new border restrictions from tomorrow to slow the spread of coronavirus and the import of new variants. All but essential travel from outside the EU will be banned and testing requirements on travellers from within the EU will be tightened. So what's happening in other countries? From Saturday,Germanyhas banned most travellers from countries hit hard by new variants. The countries are the UK, Ireland, Portugal, Brazil, South Africa, Lesotho and Eswatini. The move is expected to last until 17 February. Also from Saturday, theCzech Republichas banned non-essential entry into the country, again to try to curb the new variants. Portugalon Thursday banned non-essential overseas travel by air, land or sea for its citizens for a fortnight. Belgiumon Wednesday banned non-essential trips out of the country until 1 March. In contrast,Italysaid on Friday it would move more areas into less-restrictive rules from Monday, despite health officials warning it was risky. No areas would be classified as ""red"", which brings tough travel and business restrictions.Read more here. Boris Johnsonhas praised parents for their effortsin home schooling children amid continued UK school closures due to the pandemic. But parents do not have to go it alone.

Sixteen people were fined Â£800 each at a Plymouth house party on Saturday morning by Devon and Cornwall Police. Sgt Dan Brenchley said the party was an example of a ""small minority"" who were ""continually flouting"" lockdown rules. The new Â£800 penalty is a Â£600 increase on the previous fine for big indoor groups. The penalty for attending illegal indoor gatherings of 15 or fewer people remains Â£200, while fines of up to Â£10,000 for holding large illegal gatherings of over 30 people still only apply to organisers.

Video calls - from TV interviews to work meetings - have given us all an insight into other people's homes. And, for one company that sells books in Somerset, that's provided a very unexpected boost. Miriam BarkerBBC News This video can not be played Sianny Thomas, 34, has Inflammatory Bowel Disease and believes many councils did not consider people like her before closing some public toilets during the pandemic. ""It can be so debilitating. It's a horrible feeling, needing the toilet and not being able to go,"" she said. ""Conditions like mine are exasperated by stress, and it's a spiral for people, when they get stressed the condition worsens and they deteriorate, knowing the toilets were open would give people a lot of relief."" It can also be a problem for homeless people and parents with young children, Sianny added. Richard Edwards, chief executive of rough sleepers charity Huggard, said public safety came first and keeping toilets open during the pandemic was difficult but he said the current stay-at-home order ""ignores the fact that too many people don't have a home"". ""Without public toilets or other accessible facilities, people who find themselves sleeping rough have no alternative but to relieve themselves in the street,"" he said. ""This is personally degrading and socially unacceptable."" Read more here. Joelinton shared a picture of himself in Tom Baxter's salon on Friday A barber to the stars has called a Premier League ace an ""idiot"" for sharing a photo of himself getting anillegal lockdown haircut. Stylist Tom Baxter cut Newcastle United forward Joelinton's hair on Friday, but the Brazilian forward shared a photograph of the moment on Instagram. The crimper says it was obvious many footballers were getting professional cuts done, adding that if ""I didn't do it someone else would"". He does, however, accept he ""is not above the law"" regardingCovid rules,external. Mr Baxter says Joelinton's visit was part of a photoshoot which could be allowed under the rules, although the stylist said he ""should not have"" cut his hair and Joelinton was an ""idiot"" for putting it on social media. He says he is expecting a visit from the police and will ""accept what's handed down to me"". Students at Columbia University in the US are withholding tuition fees for the spring semester and refusing to pay for remote learning during the pandemic in the face of what they say are steep costs, US media report. They want the Ivy League university to lower its prices along with other changes. Some 1,000 students have pledged not to pay tuition, according to the group that organised the protest. In a letter,externalto the presidents, trustees and administrators of Columbia University, Barnard College and Teachers College, they demanded that the university ""alleviate the economic burden on students"" by decreasing tuition by at least 10% and increasing financial aid by at least 10%. The Columbia-Barnard chapter of the Young Democratic Socialists of America (YDSA) began organising the strike in October, and said students began withholding tuition on Friday of last week when payments were due, reports say. Tuition for undergraduates for an academic year are close to $60,000 (Â£44,000). Health bosses have apologised after some clinically extremely vulnerable children were mistakenly sent letters inviting them for a Covid vaccination. In the UK, no-one under the age of 16 has been advised to have a vaccine yet. But Nottingham and Nottinghamshire Clinical Commissioning Group (CCG) said a ""processing error"" meant the letter was sent to children. A statement said: ""We are extremely sorry for this mix-up"" and told anyone who received the letter toignore it. So who should be getting vaccinated? The jabs are being given to the most vulnerable first, with a list of nine high-priority groups being followed. You can read more details about thathere. Â© 2025 BBC.

Black Lives Matter wins human rights prize,"The Black Lives Matter movement inspired protests around the world, including in Turin, Italy The Black Lives Matter Global Network Foundation has won Sweden's Olof Palme human rights prize for 2020. Organisers said the movement was honoured,externalfor promoting ""peaceful civil disobedience against police brutality and racial violence"" across the globe. They noted that about 20 million people had taken part in Black Lives Matter (BLM) protests in the US alone, along with millions more around the world. An online prize-giving ceremony is due to take place in Stockholm on Saturday. The $100,000 (Â£73,000) annual prize commemorates Olof Palme, the Swedish prime minister and prominent human rights advocate who was assassinated in Stockholm in 1986. How BLM went from Facebook post to global movement Founded in the US in 2013, the Black Lives Matter (BLM) movement became an international slogan last year following several high-profile cases of police brutality against African-Americans. Protests that followed the deaths of George Floyd, Breonna Taylor and others saw chapters of Black Lives Matter spread across the US and around the world. ""This illustrates that racism and racist violence is not just a problem in American society, but a global problem,"" prize organisers said. They said the foundation had ""in a unique way exposed the hardship, pain, and wrath of the African-American minority at not being valued equal to people of a different colour"". A Norwegian MP, Petter Eide, has nominated the BLM foundation for this year's Nobel Peace Prize.

Why is EUâs vaccine rollout so slow?,"Poland's elderly are being vaccinated against Covid-19 Has the European Commission failed EU voters in its all-for-one and one-for-all approach to procuring coronavirus vaccines? Are member countries now regretting they didn't go it alone? As things stand, according to EU sources, the bloc looks sets to receive only a quarter of the 100 million doses it had been expecting from pharma company AstraZeneca by the end of March - putting millions of lives at risk. Vaccine deliveries from another pharma giant, Pfizer, have also slowed down temporarily, while the firm says it's adjusting production methods. Dwindling supplies of coronavirus vaccines have seen Madrid cancelling first dose injections for two weeks. Regional hospitals in Paris say they're in a similar position. They said they're delaying first dose appointments in order to ensure already-vaccinated citizens their second jab. Portugal has warned it could take up to two months longer than initially planned to complete the first phase of its vaccinations. Angela Merkel has scheduled a Monday video conference with Germany's regional leaders and representatives of vaccine manufacturers, after her Health Minister Jens Spahn warned of ""at least another 10 weeks of shortages"". Germany set to limit AstraZeneca jab to under-65s UK vaccine supplies 'won't be interrupted' - Gove What's the problem with the EU's vaccine programme? Charles Michel, the president of the European Council (the man who represents EU countries in Brussels) said on Thursday he hoped delays in vaccine deliveries could be solved. If not, he said he supported the use of ""all legal means and enforcement measures to ensure effective vaccine production and supply for our population"". In the meantime, the EU is trying to get some control over the number of vaccine doses leaving the bloc from pharmaceutical company sites. New powers for EU members to restrict exports of vaccines are expected to be made public later on Friday. AstraZeneca, BioNTech and Pfizer have EU production sites. Moderna completes its vaccines for countries other than the US in Spain, although the vaccine itself is produced in Switzerland, which is not an EU member. Basically, Brussels wants to know if pharmaceutical companies are exporting vaccines or components needed to produce vaccines from EU production sites, in order to fulfil orders elsewhere, when those same companies have delayed supplies to the EU. Officially, Brussels insists it doesn't intend to ban vaccine exports in the future. It claims the new powers for members states are for the purpose of transparency. But the situation is evolving. EU suspicions led it to ask Belgian investigators to inspect a factory - part of the AstraZeneca production chain - this week, to look into the company's claims that the dramatic delay in vaccine supply for the EU was due to production problems. Brussels also asked AstraZeneca whether vaccines produced, or partially produced, in the EU were delivered to the UK. The EU has also demanded the company divert vaccines made at its UK production sites to boost the supply to the EU. In what at first seemed an extremely emotional attack on AstraZeneca, Brussels threw at the company the fact that it had invested more than â¬300m (Â£265m; $364m) to help it develop the vaccine and to produce it in mass quantities. In reality, Brussels has yet to hand over a substantial lump of the promised amount. And some EU accusations just don't add up. Take the complaint that the bloc is being treated as ""second class"" by AstraZeneca. The fact is, when it comes to honouring its contract with the UK, for example, the EU signed its AstraZeneca vaccine contract three months later than Prime Minister Boris Johnson's government. AstraZeneca has also claimed that it has a ""best effort"" agreement with the EU, rather than a 100% commitment that the desired amount of vaccines would be delivered by the end of March. The UK has tried to stay out of the Astra Zeneca row, with the government focusing instead on the content of their contract with the pharmaceutical company. There have been public assurances from cabinet ministers that the UK supply agreed with AstraZeneca will not be affected. That was the really important thing, said UK cabinet office minister, Michael Gove, on Thursday, also adding: ""We will want to talk to and with our friends in Europe to see how we can help."" Some EU figures bridled at comments by Mr Johnson this week that he didn't want to see restrictions on vaccines or their ingredients across borders. They took it as criticism of the discussion in EU circles - originally championed, but later stepped away from, by Germany - of a possible export ban. Post-Brexit, relations are sensitive between the EU and UK - but by Thursday the European Commission was keen to spell out that its beef was with the pharmaceuticals, not with Downing Street. But while there's clearly been bad luck with vaccine supplies so far, the finger of blame has also been pointed squarely - from inside the EU - at the European Commission itself. Brussels had hoped the EU's vaccination procurement scheme would be a beacon of European solidarity and strength. A stark contrast to the ""each country for itself"" impression given off by member states at the start of the pandemic, when EU countries closed off national borders, and Germany and France initially blocked exports of PPE equipment, much needed elsewhere in the bloc. A stark contrast too, according the EU, to the ""vaccine nationalism'"" it believed it saw in the US under President Donald Trump. EU diplomats say the bloc was ""desperate"" to avoid having one EU member state pitted against the other in an ""ugly"" national scramble to secure vaccine contracts for their own populations. But the Commission's ensuing three-pronged attempt to sign a number of contracts with different pharmaceutical companies, at lower prices, ensuring more legal liability on the companies themselves, undoubtedly slowed the process down. The EU is also accused of not investing enough in expanding production capacity. An added complication was the initial suspicion from some member states of the motives of others, such as Germany, France and the Netherlands that are homes to big vaccine producers. Were they keen for the EU to spend more on vaccine procurement, so companies on their soil could benefit? The EU got there in the end with its contracts, amounting to 2.3bn doses, it says, but an online article from Belgium's RTBF describes the current vaccine situation as politically humiliating for the EU, especially after Brexit. It says even though the EU managed to negotiate vaccine contracts as a bloc, even though it played a major role in the research and development of a Covid vaccine, it ultimately failed to achieve ""vaccine sovereignty"". EU defenders say it's a question of perspective and that smaller, less well-off member states are still relieved the EU negotiated on their behalf as they would have probably found themselves far nearer the back of the vaccine queue had they been trying to go it alone. EU officials also make the argument that the European Medicines Agency (EMA) has been slower to approve new vaccines in order to be extra sure of their safety. Despite a week of rowing with AstraZeneca, for example, the EU has yet to actually approve the company's vaccine. By contrast, the UK government approved the vaccine a month ago. An EMA announcement is expected on Friday afternoon. Diplomats point to lowering levels of vaccine scepticism amongst the EU public this year, compared with 2020, for example in France, which has a pretty high level of anti-vaxxers. They attribute that to public confidence in the EMA. But EU vaccine problems don't just lie in Brussels. Some member countries have been far more efficient at rolling out the vaccines they have so far received, than others. Denmark is held up as a poster child, for example, whereas Germany's popular Bild newspaper has criticised Angela Merkel's government for being a ""vaccination snail"". And that, coupled with a steadily climbing Covid death toll, has a definite impact on national politics - and EU solidarity. This video can not be played WATCH: Pfizer v Oxford v Moderna â three Covid-19 vaccines compared This is election year in Germany. Under fire for the slow rate of getting vaccines into arms compared with the UK, the German government felt forced to admit it had negotiated a separate vaccine contract with Pfizer back in September. Ms Merkel is obliged to wait with using those additional vaccines until all EU countries have received their allotted doses under the EU-Pfizer contract, but still... Hungary, meanwhile, has agreed to purchase two million doses of Russia's Sputnik V vaccine.
