North Korea slapped with new UN sanctions,"North Korea says it has developed and tested a hydrogen bomb The United Nations has imposed a fresh round of sanctions on North Korea after its sixth and largest nuclear test. The measures restrict oil imports and ban textile exports - an attempt to starve the North of fuel and income for its weapons programmes. The US had originally proposed harsher sanctions including a total ban on oil imports. Pyongyang said it ""categorically rejected"" what it called an ""illegal"" resolution. North Korea's ambassador to the UN, Han Tae Song, told a conference in Geneva: ""The forthcoming measures by DPRK [the Democratic Republic of Korea] will make the US suffer the greatest pain it has ever experienced in its history."" Monday's vote was only passed unanimously after Pyongyang allies Russia and China agreed to the reduced measures. This video can not be played Was your T-shirt made in North Korea? TheUS call last weekfor a total ban on oil imports was seen as by some analysts as potentially destabilising for the regime. The new sanctions agreed by the UN include: Limits on imports of crude oil and oil products. China, Pyongyang's main economic ally, supplies most of North Korea's crude oil A ban on exports of textiles, which is Pyongyang's second-biggest export worth more than $700m (Â£530m) a year A ban on new visas for North Korean overseas workers, which the US estimates would eventually cut off $500m of tax revenue per year A proposed asset freeze and a travel ban on North Korean leader Kim Jong-un were dropped. The US ambassador to the UN Nikki Haley, told the Security Council after the vote: ""We don't take pleasure in further strengthening sanctions today. We are not looking for war."" ""The North Korean regime has not yet passed the point of no return,"" she added. ""If North Korea continues its dangerous path, we will continue with further pressure. The choice is theirs."" But the North Korean envoy also said: ""Instead of making [the] right choice with rational analysis... the Washington regime finally opted for political, economic and military confrontation, obsessed with the wild dream of reversing the DPRK's development of nuclear force - which has already reached the completion phase."" This video can not be played How could war with North Korea unfold? A South Korean presidential office spokesman said on Tuesday: ""North Korea needs to realise that a reckless challenge against international peace will only bring about even stronger sanctions against them."" North Korea crisis in 300 words Can the world live with a nuclear North Korea? Monday's resolution was the ninth one unanimously adopted by the UN since 2006. The UN Security Council, which includes the US, has repeatedly slapped sanctions on North Korea 30 November 2016:UN targeted North Korea's valuable coal trade with China, slashing exports by about 60% under a new sales cap. Exports of copper, nickel, silver, zinc and the sale of statues were also banned. What happened next?On 14 May 2017, North Korea tested what it said was a ""newly developed ballistic rocket"" capable of carrying a large nuclear warhead. 2 June 2017:UN imposed a travel ban and asset freeze on four entities and 14 officials, including the head of North Korea's overseas spying operations. What happened next?On 4 July, North Korea claimed it carried out its first successful test of an intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM). 6 August:UN banned North Korean exports of coal, ore and other raw materials and limited investments in the country, costing Pyongyang an estimated $1bn - about a third of its export economy. What happened next?On 3 September, North Korea said it tested a hydrogen bomb that could be miniaturised and loaded on a long-range missile. North Korea's missile programme What we know about North Korea nuclear test site How advanced is North Korea's nuclear programme? China's foreign ministrysaid on Tuesday,external(link in Chinese) that North Korea had ""ignored international opposition and once again conducted a nuclear test, severely violating UN Security Council resolutions"". It also repeated its call for a ""peaceful resolution"" instead of a military response, adding: ""China will never allow the peninsula to descend into war and chaos."" The BBC's China editor Carrie Gracie says Beijing is treading a fine line and wants sanctions tough enough to signal its displeasure to Pyongyang and avoid American accusations of complicity, but not so tough as to threaten North Korea's survival. North Korea crisis: What will Russia do? How do you defend against North Korea? Both Russia and China reiterated their proposal that the US and South Korea freeze all military drills - which anger North Korea - and asked for a halt in the deployment of the controversial anti-missile system Thaad, in exchange for Pyongyang's cessation of its weapons programmes. Beijing believes Thaad, which employs a powerful radar, is a security threat to China and neighbouring countries. Ms Haley last week dismissed this proposal as ""insulting"".

May phones Trump over Belfast jobs threat,"This video can not be played The history of Bombardier in Northern Ireland Prime Minister Theresa May has phoned US President Donald Trump over a threat to jobs at Bombardier in Belfast from a trade dispute. In 2016, Canadian firm Bombardierwon an order to supply up to 125 C-Series passenger jetsto US airline Delta. The wings for the C-Series are made at Bombardier's Belfast plant. However, rival aircraft firm Boeing has complained to the US authorities that the deal was unfairly subsidised by the Canadian state. Boeing has also complained about a UK government loan made to the Bombardier plant in Belfast. The US Department of Commerce is due to make a ruling later this month. It could hit Bombardier with punitive tariffs. What does Bombardier do in Northern Ireland? Turbulent times for Bombardier Mrs May and her Canadian counterpart, Justin Trudeau, would discuss the dispute at a meeting in Ottawa on 18 September, Reuters reported. The wings for the C-Series planes are made in Belfast Tariffs could make it very difficult for Bombardier to find new C-Series customers in the US. The C-Series project supports hundreds of jobs in Belfast. The government was ""working tirelessly to safeguard Bombardier's operations and its highly skilled workers in Belfast"", said a spokesperson. ""Ministers across government have engaged swiftly and extensively with Boeing, Bombardier, the US and Canadian governments,"" added the spokesperon. ""Our priority is to encourage Boeing to drop its case and seek a negotiated settlement with Bombardier."" Mrs May raised the issue and her concern to protect jobs in Northern Ireland in a call with President Donald Trump last week, Downing Street confirmed. Business Secretary Greg Clark had also travelled to Chicago to meet Boeing's chairman, president and chief executive officer, Dennis Muilenburg. Bombardier managers in Belfast are also understood to have recently briefed trade unions about the importance of the case. Boeing has alleged that Bombardier engaged in ""price dumping"" by agreeing to sell 75 of their planes for almost $14m (Â£10.6m) below their cost price. The company said it had appealed to the International Trade Commission ""to restore a level playing field in the US single-aisle airplane market"". ""Boeing had to take action as subsidised competition has hurt us now and will continue to hurt us for years to come, and we could not stand by given this clear case of illegal dumping,"" it said in a statement. ""Global trade only works if everyone plays by the same rules of the road, and that's a principle that ultimately creates the greatest value for Canada, the United Kingdom, the United States, and our aerospace industry."" It also pointed out that the Delta deal came after theregional government in Quebec effectively bailed outthe C-Series programme with a $1bn investment. ""Equity infusions from government coffers not only rescued the program but have given Bombardier the resources it needs to aggressively target the US market,"" it said. Bombardier has described the allegations as ""absurd"" and said the government investments ""comply with the laws and regulations in the jurisdictions where we do business"". Speaking in the House of Commons on Tuesday, Liberal Democrat leader Sir Vince Cable called on the UK government to ""commit itself to standing very firmly behind Bombardier and its workers, and alongside the Canadian Government in resisting bullying from Boeing and its friend in the United States administration"". Minister for Climate Change and Industry Claire Perry said: ""It is vitally important that we have this dispute settled and we create the environment for many manufacturers in this vital sector to thrive and grow."" Strangford DUP MP Jim Shannon raised concerns about the future of the C-Series with Research and Innovation Minister, Jo Johnson. ""He'll be aware of Boeing's attempts to stop the contract which will add $30m (Â£23m) to every plane (coming into) C-Series in Belfast,"" he said. Mr Johnson replied: ""I can assure him that we are engaging very closely with the companies involved and will be following up on his point.""

'Monkey selfie' legal fight settled,"Mr Slater said that he had to earn the trust of the monkeys over several days before venturing close enough to get the selfie A photographer has settled a two-year legal fight against an animal rights group over a ""monkey selfie"" picture. Naruto the macaque monkey took the image in the Indonesian jungle in 2011 when it picked up a camera owned by David Slater from Monmouthshire. USjudges had saidcopyright protection could not be applied to the monkey butPeta,externalsaid theanimal should benefit. Peta's appeal on the ""monkey's behalf"" was dismissed but Mr Slater has agreed to donate 25% of any future revenue. In a joint statement from Peta and Mr Slater, it said the photographer will give a quarter of the funds he receives from selling the monkey selfies to registered charities ""dedicated to protecting the welfare or habitat of Naruto"". ""Peta's groundbreaking case sparked a massive international discussion about the need to extend fundamental rights to animals for their own sake, not in relation to how they can be exploited by humans,"" said Peta lawyer Jeff Kerr. Mr Slater, of Chepstow, said he put in a lot of effort which was more than enough for him to claim copyright. Peta claimed the monkey is a female called Naruto but Mr Slater claimed it was a different male macaque He also said he was a conservationist and interest in the image had already helped animals in Indonesia. The case was listed as ""Naruto v David Slater"" but the identity of the monkey had also been in dispute, with Peta claiming it is a female called Naruto and Mr Slater saying it is a different male macaque. But appeal judges at a court in San Francisco ruled in Mr Slater's favour after a two-year legal fight. In the joint-statement between Peta and Mr Slater, they say this case ""raises important, cutting-edge issues about expanding legal rights for non-human animals"".

MPs vote on Brexit bill,"MPs question education ministers Second reading debate of EU Withdrawal Bill goes late into night Peers meet at 2.30pm for questions to government ministers Main business in Lords is Financial Guidance and Claims Bill Kate Whannel and Esther Webber As part of Brexit, the government plans to end the supremacy of EU law - here are the key points. The EU Withdrawal Bill passes its first parliamentary test but will face more attempts to change it. House of CommonsParliament That wraps up debate on the EU Withdrawal Bill today. The government won its votes on second reading and the programme motion - and comfortably defeated Labour's amendment. But looking ahead in Westminster later today, the Commons could be facing another late night... A major row has blown up over a move designed to guarantee the government a majority on committees which do the line-by-line scrutiny of legislation. Labour argues that the government didn't get a majority in the election, so they shouldn't have one to drive through their programme in the committees either. There may be some fireworks surrounding those votes. The Commons sits at 11.30am, kicking off with questions to the Business Secretary Greg Clark and his team of ministers. See you then... Select committee motions House of CommonsParliament Leader of the House Andrea Leadsom has tabled a motion to nominate members of the select committees, which MPs agree to. Last week Speaker John Bercow criticised the whips for the delay in tabling the motion - without which committees cannot commence. Criticism has also come from the Labour Party whoaccusedministers of ""unprecedented attempt to rig Parliament"" by ensuring Conservatives had a majority on the committees despite not achieving a majority in the election.

Analysis Laura KuenssbergBBC political editor The BBC has been told that
Conservative MPs concerned about the EU Withdrawal Bill have tabled a number of
amendments to âremove the excesses of the billâ and to âmake considerable
improvementsâ. The BBC understands that
some of the amendments have attracted the support of up to 12 Conservative MPs,
including select committee chairs Nicky Morgan, Tom Tugenhadt, Bob Neill and
Sarah Wollaston. The amendments would âlimitâ
so-called Henry VIII powers, give Parliament the âfinal sayâ on the withdrawal
agreement, restore the European Charter of Fundamental Rights and address
concerns about the relationship between EU and British law. They would also provide a
triage process for the required delegated legislation and provide for one exit
date. One MP told the BBC âwe
hope MPs from all parties who share our concerns and aims to make the Bill fit
for the purpose of delivering a smooth Brexit will add their namesâ.

EU Withdrawal Bill House of CommonsParliament MPs vote 318 to 296 against Labour's amendment which sought to decline to give a second reading to the bill. Sean CurranParliamentary correspondent BBC Radio 4's Today in Parliament presenter Sean Curran says there could be some Labour MPs who rebel against their party line tonight, to show their constituents they are supporting Brexit. He says that the government should win the vote on the second reading - but what about the next stages? That's going to be the tension - at the committee stage, Sean says. ""Tonight, whenever the voting finishes, there will be a rush towards officials at the table, so MPs can put down amendments straight away,"" he explains. The government is proposing eight more days of debate at committee stage, with eight hours on those days. MPs will be going through the bill line by line, arguing about what the bill means, and that will be the opportunity for MPs like Ken Clarke and Dominic Grieve to put their case.

A Facebook Live video shared and watched over 500,000 times on Saturday from Facebook page The Best American Offers claimed to show a double tornado approaching Florida. ""Hurricane Irma approaches,"" it warned. A Facebook Live claiming to show a double tornado approaching Florida was part of hurricane Irma was actually footage from at least 2007. However the video dates fromat least 2007.,externaland appears to be of a storm near the Isle of Elba, in the Mediterranean Sea, in 2006. ""This is a fake news page,"" one user warned. But others said the video made them fear the arrival of the hurricane in Florida. So whether you read, repeat or repost news, here are some questions to ask yourself: Have I heard of the publisher before? Is this the source I think it is, or does it sound a bit like them? Can I point to where this happened on a map? Has this been reported elsewhere? Is there more than one piece of evidence for this claim? Could this be something else?

Australian PM defended over baby photo,"This photo created much discussion in Australia on the weekend Australians have come to the defence of PM Malcolm Turnbull after a photo of him holding his grandchild and a beer became a topic of much discussion. It began innocuously enough: Mr Turnbull shared the photo of himself with his young granddaughter at an Australian Rules football final in Sydney on Saturday. The image was posted on his Facebook page alongside the caption: ""Multitasking at the footy."" But it prompted some comments criticising Mr Turnbull over the presence of the beer. ""Disgraceful holding a child with alcohol in hand!"" wrote Marg Walker. Another criticised it as ""irresponsible"", while one person said they found it ""disgusting to see people breathing grog all over baby's [sic]"". The objections gained a wider audience when they were picked up by national media outlets. Descriptions of it ranged from a""minor storm"",externalto a""huge backlash"",external. However, as quickly as the criticism emerged, so too did those defending Mr Turnbull as having done nothing wrong. ""What a beautiful photo. Mr Turnbull has every right to nurse and enjoy cuddling his grandchild,"" wrote Jan Robertson. Star Wars actor Hamill 'supports Wolves' Britons' 'honeymoon from hell' in Cuba Brazil tycoon arrested in corruption case Caroline Overington wrote: ""This is absurd. The PM is taking good care of the baby.  It's a beautiful shot."" Others pointed out that it is common to sensibly enjoy an alcoholic beverage in Australian sporting stadiums. Some wondered what would have happened if Mr Turnbull had been pictured clasping a non-alcoholic beverage, such as a cup of tea. The list of Mr Turnbull's defenders even grew to include his political rival, opposition leader Bill Shorten. Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Another political opponent, Greens Senator Sarah Hanson-Young, told Channel Seven: ""If anything this has made the prime minister look a bit more personable to the public."" Some said if there was any criticism of the photo it should be that it was potentially stage-managed. The nation's two dominant football codes, Australian Rules and rugby league, attract huge attention during their finals seasons in September. By Monday, much of the anger was being directed at those who had sparked the discussion. ""[The photo is] lovely, and all these keyboard warriors need to get a life!"" wrote one commenter, Fiona Deegan. The sentiment was echoed by Mr Turnbull, who played down the debate in his first interview for the week. ""I think it's the craziness of social media when you see things like that,"" he told local radio station Triple M. ""As long as you're comfortable in your own skin and you're just being yourself, being natural, that's all you can do.""

Irma leaves most of Florida without power,"This video can not be played The BBC's correspondents in the region chart Irma's path of destruction About 6.5 million homes in Florida, two-thirds of the total, are without power after Hurricane Irma cut a deadly path through the state, officials say. Relief operations are under way and engineers are working to restore power, but many areas remain stranded. The islands of the Florida Keys and western parts of the US state bore the brunt of the category-four hurricane. Irma hit Florida on Sunday and weakened to a tropical storm before becoming a tropical depression early on Tuesday. The storm was downgraded as it moved north towards Atlanta, with maximum sustained winds of 56km/h (35mph) later recorded, the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said in a statement. TheNHC statement,externaladded that while heavy rain was expected to continue across south-eastern states, all storm surge and tropical storm warnings had been discontinued. Media reports link at least four deaths to the storm in Florida. Last week it killed at least 37 people in Caribbean islands. Pope condemns climate sceptics Damage mapped Florida assesses cost of Hurricane Irma This video can not be played Aerial footage shows the damage to homes in Orlando, Florida White House Homeland Security Adviser Tom Bossert said it will be some time before residents in the Florida Keys are able to return to their homes. ""I would expect that the Keys are not fit for re-entry for regular citizenry for weeks"", he said. Speaking as he went on an aerial tour of the Keys, Florida Governor Rick Scott said: ""Power lines are down throughout the state. We've got roads that are impassable, so everybody's got to be patient as we work through this."" A number of fatal car crashes in Florida are being linked to the storm The Keys are cut off from the mainland, as the 42 bridges that link them are being assessed for damage. Reports say that 10,000 people decided to ride out the storm.

EU repeal bill wins first Commons vote,"This video can not be played The moment the government's attempt to take the UK out of EU law passed its first parliamentary test The government's bid to extract the UK from EU law in time for Brexit has passed its first parliamentary test. MPs backed the EU Withdrawal Bill by 326 votes to 290 despite critics warning that it represented a ""power grab"" by ministers. The bill, which will end the supremacy of EU law in the UK, now moves onto its next parliamentary stage. Ministers sought to reassure MPs by considering calls for safeguards over their use of new powers. Prime Minister Theresa May welcomed the Commons vote in the early hours of Tuesday morning, saying the bill offered ""certainty and clarity"" - but Labour described it as an ""affront to parliamentary democracy"". Seven Labour MPs defied Jeremy Corbyn's order to oppose the bill - Ronnie Campbell, Frank Field, Kate Hoey, Kelvin Hopkins, John Mann, Dennis Skinner and Graham Stringer. No Conservatives voted against it. Having cleared the second reading stage, the bill will now face more attempts to change it with MPs, including several senior Conservative backbenchers, publishing a proposed 157 amendments, covering 59 pages. Kuenssberg: Victory, but ministers can't relax EU Withdrawal Bill: How your MP voted A guide to the EU Withdrawal Bill Repeal bill 'not a blank cheque' UK seeks EU defence partnership Previously referred to as the Great Repeal Bill, the EU Withdrawal Bill overturns the 1972 European Communities Act which took the UK into the then European Economic Community. It will also convert all existing EU laws into UK law, to ensure there are no gaps in legislation on Brexit day. Critics' concerns centre on ministers giving themselves the power to make changes to laws during this process without consulting MPs. The government says it needs to be able to make minor technical changes to ensure a smooth transition, but fears were raised that ministers were getting sweeping powers to avoid parliamentary scrutiny. More than 100 MPs had their say during the two-day second reading debate. This video can not be played ""This isn't the end of this bill, just one very early stage"" Labour, which denounced the ""vague offers"" of concessions, mostly voted against the bill. Shadow Brexit secretary Sir Keir Starmer said the bill was a ""naked power grab"" by the government, adding that ""this is a deeply disappointing result"". He said: ""Labour will seek to amend and remove the worst aspects from the bill but the flaws are so fundamental it's hard to see how this could ever be made fit for purpose."" Lib Dem Brexit spokesman Tom Brake said MPs who backed the bill should feel ""ashamed"". ""This is a dark day for the mother of parliaments,"" he added. Summing up the Commons debate, Justice Secretary David Lidington had said some criticism had been ""exaggerated up to and beyond the point of hyperbole"". He said the bill would ""enable us to have a coherent and functioning statute book"" on the day the UK leaves the EU. BBC political editor Laura Kuenssberg said Conservative MPs concerned about the legislation had already tabled a number of amendments to ""remove the excesses of the bill"" and to ""make considerable improvements"". These include limiting the use of delegated powers, giving Parliament the ""final say"" on the EU withdrawal agreement and restoring the EU Charter of Fundamental Rights. One MP told the BBC: ""We hope MPs from all parties who share our concerns and aims to make the bill fit for the purpose of delivering a smooth Brexit will add their names."" SNP MPs, who also voted against the bill, said powers over devolved issues would be seized by Westminster as they were returned from Brussels. But Mr Lidington denied this, predicting it would result in a ""significant increase"" in the powers exercised by the devolved administrations. The bill will now receive line-by-line scrutiny in its committee stage. MPs voted in favour of the government's proposed timetable for debating legislation - by 318 votes to 301 - guaranteeing 64 hours of debate over eight days. But Mr Lidington said the government was ""willing to consider"" extending the allocated time. The Bill's committee stage will take place when MPs return to parliament after their party conferences.

UK soldiers charged with terror offences,"Far-right group National Action was banned in 2016 Three men, including two British soldiers, have been charged under terror laws with being members of a banned neo-Nazi group. Alexander Deakin, 22, Mikko Vehvilainen, 32, and Mark Barrett, 24, have been charged with being members of National Action. It was the first far-right group to be banned by the Home Office in 2016. They are among five men arrested on 5 September. Two others have since been released without charge. Mr Deakin from Birmingham, Mr Vehvilainen, based at Sennybridge Camp in Brecon, and Mr Barrett, based at Dhekelia Garrison in Cyprus, will appear at Westminster Magistrates' Court on Tuesday. West Midlands Police has said the arrests were ""pre-planned and intelligence-led"" with no threat to public safety. Mr Deakin has been charged with two counts under Section 58 of the Terrorism Act 2000 - alleged possession of documents likely to be useful to a person preparing to commit an act of terrorism. The 22-year-old is also charged with one count of distributing a terrorist publication. Separately he faces one count of inciting racial hatred - allegedly posting a number of National Action stickers at the Aston University campus in Birmingham in July 2016. Mr Vehvilainen has also been charged under the Terrorism Act 2000 for the possession of a document likely to be useful to a person preparing to commit an act of terrorism. The 32-year-old also faces two counts of publishing threatening, abusive or insulting comments online intending to stir up racial hatred under the Public Order Act 1986. He has also been charged with possession of a weapon - pepper spray.

Learndirect 'should face investigation',"Training company Learndirect should face an investigation after it was rated ""inadequate"" by Ofsted, the chair of the Public Accounts Committee says. The firm is estimated to have received more than Â£600m of public funding since 2011, but Meg Hillier said the government must demonstrate there were consequences for failure. Ofsted has told the BBC no training provider should be beyond scrutiny. Learndirect said it had made strong progress in improving its provision. Ofsted's report, which the company tried to prevent being made public,rated Learndirect inadequate overall,with failings in apprenticeships and lesser problems in adult learning. No termination of contract notice has been issued, which would normally follow a similar rating. Officials have told the BBC that because there is a need to ""protect learners and maintain other key public services run by Learndirect Ltd"", the contract will run its course until next summer with intensive monitoring. But those officials will face questions about their handling of the contract when they next appear before the influential Commons Public Accounts Committee (PAC). Labour MP Ms Hillier MP said: ""It's a very big contract and we're concerned the way Learndirect is treated is a sign the government considers it is too big to fail, which raises wider issues about how we contract these things out."" She said she had asked the National Audit Office to consider looking into the contract. ""If something is failing, the government needs to take action,"" Ms Hillier continued. ""It needs to show there are consequences, and it's a real slap in the face to providers out there doing a good job, who are rated good or excellent by Ofsted, who then see a failing provider seemingly getting away with it."" Learndirect Ltd has dozens of subcontractors, and takes a share of the contract value in return for passing the work on. But this case raise may wider questions about the scrutiny of major public contracts. The head of Ofsted, Amanda Spielman, spoke exclusively to the BBC and FE Week in a joint interview about the lessons that need to be learned. ""We have to make sure that we say what we have to say about quality, no matter what,"" she said. ""We have to do that as early on as possible in the life of providers so we don't end up with more Learndirects where there are 20,000 apprentices not getting what they should be getting."" She refused to be drawn on her view of the response by the Department for Education (DfE) following the Ofsted report, saying: ""It is not for us to decide what happens to Learndirect."" But she added: ""I hope that the lessons from Learndirect will really focus people's minds on what can be done up front, especially with very large providers. ""In any system there are always going to be some problems, some providers with difficulty, and making sure the system can cope with the failure of any provider is an essential part of a functioning market."" There is a risk for Ofsted that if robust action isn't seen to be taken following a critical report,  its own authority is undermined. In a BBC interview, Skills Minister Anne Milton said Learndirect Ltd was not seen by the government as too big to fail. ""It is most certainly not untouchable, we have the learners' interests at heart. ""We will continue to act swiftly with Learndirect and any other provider that fails to do as their contract specifies."" She also gave an undertaking to recoup any public money for training not delivered - the first time the government has said this publicly. ""We will claw back from Learndirect any bit of their contract they have failed to fulfil."" That could only happen after an audit of the contract, if it was found that some training had not been delivered. Amanda Spielman said lessons must be learned from this case This criticism of Learndirect comes at a time when a significant expansion of apprenticeships is about to unfold. The prospect of the new employer-funded apprenticeship levy has led to around 2,000 potential providers joining a new government register. Ms Spielman said: ""There are very clear risks. One is about people who shouldn't be providing training at all, making sure they don't get onto the register, or recognising that at the earliest possible moment before lives are disrupted. ""One is about making sure that people who have the potential to do it well stay in control of their business model and don't lose sight of apprentices through layers of subcontracts that aren't managed well."" The new system will be very different, because employers will commission as well as fund the training. Learndirect said it was making improvements to its adult training. ""We remain committed to working with current employers and apprentices to ensure they receive the training and skills they need to succeed,"" it said. ""Our focus is on delivering the highest levels of service and outcomes, and we will continue working closely with the DfE and ESFA [Education and Skills Funding Agency] to ensure its requirements around quality measures are met."" A separate company Learndirect Apprenticeships Limited has been set up for business under the new apprenticeship levy. A spokesman for that company said Ofsted had recognised it had prepared well for the new system and that corporate apprenticeship customers were happy with the standard of learning.

Parents remove son in gender row,"This video can not be played Sally and Nigel Rowe say their child came home from school confused and unhappy The parents of a six-year-old boy have removed him from his primary school in a row over whether another pupil should be allowed to wear a dress. Nigel and Sally Rowe said their son was confused as to why the child at the Church of England School on the Isle of Wight dressed as both a boy and a girl. The Diocese of Portsmouth, under which the school falls, said it was required to ""respect diversity of all kinds"". The couple believe the school should have consulted all parents. Mrs Rowetold the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programmethat when they spoke with the school, which is not being identified, they were told ""if a child wants to do that then we just have to accept it"". The couple said under the school's bullying policy their son faced being disciplined for misidentifying the gender of the six-year-old pupil. Trans children: Preparing for puberty School adopts gender neutral uniform What does legally changing gender involve? Two years ago they removed their eldest son from the same school in a separate row about a different child with gender identity issues. The Rowes say the suggestion that gender is fluid conflicts with their Christian beliefs and they are seeking a legal challenge against the school's actions. The Christian Legal Centre, which is supporting Mr and Mrs Rowe, said the couple were being accused of ""transphobic behaviour"" because of their ""refusal to acknowledge a transgender person's true gender"". Mr Rowe said: ""I am shocked by the suggestion, especially from a church school, that just because we question the notion that a six-year-old boy can really become a girl, we are transphobic."" She added:: ""We believe he [the older boy] was under stress by the confusion that was caused by having a boy in his class that decided that they were going to have a girl's name and dress as a girl."" There is no specific law dictating uniforms. Schools are free to set their own rules as long as they don't breach human rights and equality legislation; in other words, they cannot discriminate on the basis of gender, race, disability, sexual orientation or faith. Under the Human Rights Act, schools must also make sure that no child is prevented from accessing education due to their uniform rules. It's more common for schools or employers to be challenged over dress codes when people are prevented from wearing something, for instance a hijab or a crucifix necklace, rather than because they have permitted something - in this case for a boy to wear the regulation girls' uniform. This case is unusual because the parents taking legal action are protesting against a form of uniform being permitted rather than prohibited, and because their child is not the party being directly affected by the rules. This is likely to make their case harder to argue. It will all come down to competing rights - for both children to freely access education and not to be discriminated against. Source: BBC Reality Check Jeff Williams, director of education for the Diocese of Portsmouth, said: ""Church of England schools are inclusive environments where pupils learn to respect diversity of all kinds. ""Like any other state school, our schools comply with the legal requirements of the Equalities Act 2010. ""Among other things, this requires schools to accept the wishes of children and their families with regard to gender identity. It would be unlawful for any of our schools to do otherwise."" Mr and Mrs Rowe say the school's handling of the situation did not show proper regard for the possible long-term emotional and psychological effects for the two young children seeking to change gender, or for the confusion and concern caused to other people by the suggestion that boys are not always boys, and girls are not always girls. LGBT campaigner Jane Fae, who is transgender, said Mr and Mrs Rowe had misjudged the issue, as children with gender issues needed sympathy to help prevent them being bullied.

School tells pupils to go to bed early,"Pupils have been told to be in bed by 21:30 in a set of strict new rules at the failing school The new head of a failing school has come in for severe criticism after introducing strict new rules to improve pupil performance. Concerns over the ""army-like schooling"" at Great Yarmouth Charter Academy have been expressed by parents onFacebook,external. New rules include banning mobile phones and children have been told to be in bed by 21:30 every night. But a spokesman for the school said what pupils needed was ""the right environment to learn and succeed"". Great Yarmouth High School was taken over by Inspiration Trust and re-named Charter Academy. Until this summer it had ""some of the worst GCSE results in the entire country"", according to new principal Barry Smith. ""In a typical class of 30 pupils, 21 pupils left the school without even a pass in English and maths,"" he said. ""As the headmaster of Charter Academy I cannot, I will not, allow the indiscipline, the disrespect, the failure, the bullying, the truancy and the lack of parental support, that were all a part of daily life at the former high school, to continue. ""There's a lot more to school than just passing exams. Every good teacher knows that. But, when push comes to shove, kids need those grades."" Parents have expressed concern over strict new rules at Great Yarmouth Charter Academy A Facebook page was set up by parent Kelvin Seal, on which parents expressed concern over the strict uniform rules and detention for dental appointments taken during school hours. Children have been told to be in bed by 21:30 every night and up at 06:30, and warned those claiming to feel sick during lessons would be handed a bucket to vomit in instead of being allowed to leave classrooms. Seeing a parent and child crying outside the school, Mr Seal told the BBC he politely asked the head: ""'Excuse me, why are you doing this to children?' His reply was 'If you don't like it, get out.'"" Inspiration Trust spokesman James Goffin said: ""Unfortunately there has been a lot of rumour and inaccurate information spread on social media that has understandably concerned some parents and pupils."" A document shared with the BBC revealed the standards of discipline expected from pupils. The 22-page document included the following: If you slouch, interrupt, talk, pick up your pen or open a book before you receive the signal, if you turn around, if you nudge your friend, if you make eye contact with your friend, if you look anywhere apart from at your teacher, the board or your work - you will be punished. You never get out of your chair without permission at Charter. In corridors, we walk in single file on the left. No bags on our backs. No turning round. At Charter you listen to every single word your teacher says very, very carefully. You don't pick up your pen or your ruler, or anything else, until your teacher gives you the signal. Teachers never leave lesson to go to the toilet. You need to be professional too. Steven Homes said his daughter was ""begging him"" not to send her back to the the academy Parent Steven Holmes said his daughter came home in tears at the end of her first day in year seven saying she had been shouted at all day. ""I want her to learn not be in fear, "" said Mr Holmes. ""This isn't about discipline. It's bullying."" Mr Goffin said: ""The academy will be holding a meeting for all parents in the coming days so they can hear first-hand what Great Yarmouth Charter Academy is really all about."" 140 pupils 'not getting school education' Inspiration Trust Shock after human bones left outside church MP raises concerns over 1,000 empty homes in district Radical review of district councils has put plans in limbo Anger grows as councillors get ready for crunch vote to cancel elections Man charged in connection with bike thefts in Norwich Car stolen after being left to de-ice unattended At least two killed and 1,000 structures destroyed as wildfires rage in Los Angeles Los Angeles wildfires in maps 'Patients are collapsing in the waiting room': A&E nurses speak out Where is Greenland and why does Trump want it?

Man 'choked on anniversary steak',"Michael Pitts had been dining with his wife at The Grapevine restaurant in Odiham when he choked on the steak An 84-year-old man died after choking on a piece of ribeye steak while celebrating his 57th wedding anniversary, an inquest heard. Michael Pitts was dining with wife, Joan, 78, at The Grapevine restaurant in Odiham, Hampshire, on 16 June, when the meat became lodged in his throat. Restaurant staff and paramedics tried to resuscitate him but he later died in hospital. Coroner Andrew Bradley recorded a verdict of death by misadventure. He added a post-mortem examination showed the cause of death was asphyxia contributed to by heart disease and old age. Mrs Pitts told the Basingstoke inquest her husband had complained the steak was a bit chewy but when asked by the waiter if he wanted it changed, he said that it was ""probably just the cow"". ""It was his sense of humour,"" she added. She continued: ""I just saw him coughing and I thought he had something which catches. ""I told him to have a glass of water, and with that his arms went down and he just fell backwards into his chair."" Staff at the restaurant attempted to resuscitate Mr Pitts and put him in the recovery position until paramedics arrived, the inquest heard. After about 40 minutes the medical team found his airways were blocked and extracted a piece of steak from his throat. He later died in hospital. Mrs Pitts said everyone ""worked extremely hard"" but added no-one initially realised food was stuck. Restaurant manager Sumin Lohani described the death as ""very sad"", adding: ""It should have been the best memory to celebrate their 57th wedding anniversary at my restaurant."" Mr Bradley said: ""It was a celebration that went wrong, it could not go any more wrong than that.""

Vast rally for independence in Barcelona,"This video can not be played Thousands march in Barcelona in support of an independence referendum Hundreds of thousands of Catalans in Barcelona have marked their national day - the ""Diada"" - in support of an independence referendum. The city's streets were a mass of red and yellow flags three weeks ahead of the planned vote - which the Spanish government has deemed illegal. Catalonia's pro-independence government has passed a law to secede from Spain if the vote is Yes. Opinion polls suggest the vote, if it takes place, will be very close. With their own language and customs, Catalans already have much autonomy. Organisers say more than a million people took part in the protest But there is a widespread feeling in the region - one of Spain's richest - that too much of its tax revenue goes to Madrid. Estimates of the numbers taking part in Monday's protest varied - organisers said it was more than one million people, but Spanish government officials quoted by local media said it was much lower than that. Spain's economic woes since the 2008 financial crisis - including chronic unemployment - have fuelled the pro-independence mood in Catalonia. Catalan leaders seek abrupt Spain split Catalonia profile Will Catalonia try to secede from Spain this year? In recent days Spain's Guardia Civil police have raided several Catalan printing shops suspected of preparing material for the referendum. The crowd in central Barcelona swelled as Catalans of all ages descended on the city. Nearly 2,000 buses were chartered to bring people to the rally. The city's police, the GuÃ rdia Urbana, tweeted on Monday evening that ""around a million people have participated"". Patriotic face-painting is common during the Diada Those who gathered in Barcelona - many sporting T-shirts in the national colours - were hopeful the vote would go ahead, despite Spain's Constitutional Court placing a legal block on the independence referendum. A majority of Catalans want the vote to go ahead, polls suggest, to settle the thorny issue of independence. ""We are in the 21st century and this constitution which says that the referendum is illegal is from 40 years ago: times change,"" Laura Alberch, 25, told news agency AFP. Anna Comellas, 20, said: ""Time passes and people become more and more aware that remaining in Spain harms us."" The 11 September Diada marks the fall of Barcelona in the War of Spanish Succession in 1714 - a defeat for Catalan forces. The striped Catalan flag also adorned the iconic Sagrada Familia church The left-wing mayor of Barcelona, Ada Colau, cautiously backs the referendum, but has asked the Catalan parliament for guarantees to make the vote as inclusive as possible. In November 2014, Catalonia held an unofficial ""consultation"" on independence - and some 80% of those who voted backed it. But turnout then was relatively low and the vote was non-binding, as the Constitutional Court had ruled it illegal.

Man fined for Hoover Dam stag do swim,"An ""adrenalin junkie"" from north Wales has been fined by police in America after swimming across the Colorado River at the Hoover Dam. Arron Hughes, 28, was on a stag do when he took a dip at the dam on the Arizona-Nevada border near Las Vegas. The forklift driver from Ruthin, Denbighshire, was arrested at the scene and fined $330 (Â£250). ""We got there and it was absolutely roasting. I thought to myself 'I'm going in for a dip',"" he said. Turbines close to where Mr Hughes was swimming were not on when he was in the water on 8 August. ""The plan was just to go for a little dip at the start and then I thought 'I can make this' so I swam across, I made it from Arizona to Nevada,"" he said. ""I don't have any regrets. I even have a tattoo saying 'no regrets', that's the type of person I am."" His ticket issued by Nevada police lists the offence as: ""Jumping, diving, swimming from dam's spillways or other structures.""

A number of people who had fled the Keys and checked into our hotel were struggling to keep in touch with relatives who had decided to stay behind. Reports say that 10,000 people decided to ride out the storm. We do not know what state they are in now. The first job rescue services will have to do is to test the integrity of the 42 bridges linking the Keys. If one of those is down, it could cause problems because it could strand any one of the islands. The entire Keys are closed. There is no way of getting in there at the moment while the authorities assess the damage. This video can not be played How badly did Irma hit the Florida Keys? Although Miami was spared the brunt of the storm, large parts of the city are under water. Winds have snapped power lines and 72% of homes there are without electricity, officials say. On the west coast of Florida, dronefootage from Naples,external, a town on the coast of the Gulf of Mexico about 125 miles (200km) to the north-west, shows rows of shattered suburban homes on streets under water. President Donald Trump has released emergency federal aid for Florida, describing the hurricane as a ""big monster"". Funds will be needed to care for victims, clean up debris, restore power, and repair damage to homes and businesses. Martin Senterfitt, emergency management director for Monroe County, said a huge airborne mission was in the works,the Miami Herald reports,external. ""Disaster mortuary teams"", he said on Sunday, would be dispatched to the Keys, which are part of Monroe. A number of fatal car crashes in Florida are being linked to the storm UK plan to bolster hurricane relief effort At 12:00 GMT, the centre of the storm was about 105 miles (170km) north of Tampa,the National Hurricane Center (NHC) said,external. Before and after in Bonita Springs, Florida Some three million people live in the Tampa Bay area. The region has not been hit by a major hurricane since 1921. Irma made landfall on Marco Island off Florida's west coast at 15:35 local time (19:35 GMT) on Sunday, with winds of up to 120mph. ""We feel the building swaying all the time,"" restaurant owner Deme Lomas told Reuters news agency by phone from his 35th-floor apartment in Miami.

Bin strike council leader resigns,"John Clancy said he accepted he had made mistakes The leader of Birmingham City Council, John Clancy, has resigned following criticism of his handling of industrial action by refuse workers. In a statement, he said""frenzied media speculation"" about the dispute,externalwas beginning to harm both the council and the Birmingham Labour Party. Labour councillors last week proposed a no-confidence motion in Mr Clancy. He said he accepted he had made mistakes ""for which he is sorry"" and takes ""full responsibility"". The cost of Birmingham's bin strike Workers resumed their strike on 1 September after a deal, which had seen the seven-week action suspended, fell apart. Bin bags have piled up in Birmingham during the dispute Mr Clancy, who has been leader of Birmingham City Council since December 2015, said the actions he took to negotiate an end to an ""extremely complex and difficult industrial dispute were done with the best of intentions"". He also mentioned in his statement that ""events in his personal life"" had convinced him there were ""issues of far more importance than Birmingham City Council"". Mr Clancy ended it by saying: ""I really am looking forward to spending more time with my family."" This video can not be played Unite calls for Birmingham City Council chief executive to resign Ian Ward is now acting leader of the council. Refuse workers started strike action on 30 June in a dispute over job re-grading and shift patterns. The Unite union says restructuring plans threaten the jobs of more than 120 staff, while the council says the changes will modernise the service and save Â£5m a year. The action was suspended on 16 August when conciliation service Acas said the city council had agreed certain posts would not be made redundant, and bin collections resumed. But on 31 August, the council said it was issuing redundancy notices and the industrial action restarted the following day. Mr Clancy's announcement came just after it emerged that the government has written to Birmingham's Improvement Panel asking it for an urgent update into events. Unite is also calling for the council chief executive Stella Manzie to leave The panel, which was overseeing the running of the council, was set up in 2014 following an inquiry into the so-called Trojan Horse letter and council services. In August it said it was satisfied the council could continue under its own steam. But Sajid Javid, Secretary of State for the Department of Communities and Local Government has written to the panel saying that ""clearly, there have been some developments since then which could have major implications"" both for the council's leadership and finance and asked for an urgent update before he decided what the next steps should be. Andy Street, Metro Mayor for the West Midlands, tweeted to say Mr Clancy has been a ""generous colleague"". Allow Twitter content? This article contains content provided by Twitter.

Unite's assistant general secretary Howard Beckett told BBC WM Mr Clancy ""made a mistake by claiming there was no deal in place when everybody knew there was and Acas recorded the deal"". ""I'm just sorry the whole situation has got to this. He did an honourable deal and, I believe we would have had a settlement long ago and he made a crucial error."" Mr Beckett also stated interim chief executive of Birmingham City Council, Stella Manzie, ""must follow in John Clancy's footsteps and resign"". Residents in one part of the city marked 50 days since their rubbish had last been collected ""Stella Manzie has twice blocked Unite lawyers meeting council lawyers to discuss the fictitious equal pay concerns she is using to scupper the agreement that Unite reached with the council at Acas. ""John Clancy in his statement has made it clear this agreement was reached with the full knowledge of the cabinet."" Birmingham's nine Labour MPs had previously written a letter describing the city council as ""an obstacle to moving forward"" in resolving the bin strike. In the letter addressed to Mr Clancy, MPs said delays to finding a solution were ""unacceptable"". The Labour-run council said a swift end to the dispute was its ""top priority"". Rubbish piles up in Sparkhill, Birmingham David Jamieson, the Police and Crime Commissioner for the West Midlands, said Mr Clancy ""made the right choice"" to resign. ""He's stood back because he feels he's an impediment to Birmingham going forward. Birmingham has an excellent set of councillors to choose from to choose a new leader."" John Clancy's resignation was seen as inevitable by some following his comments there was never any deal with Unite over the bin dispute. Unite have made it clear they feel a deal was not honoured What followed was a series of allegations and reported evidence there had indeed been some kind of deal - and not only that, but John Clancy had overstepped the mark and overplayed his hand in promising it. Whilst many people believe his intentions were good, his failure to admit mistakes in that crucial 'no deal' interview meant there was nowhere to go. Confidence in the leader was crumbling and his resignation may have been influenced by three things: a critical letter from Labour MPs, a reported private meeting of his cabinet where all but one called for him to step down, and a government letter asking for an 'urgent update' from the independent panel monitoring the way the council keeps its house in order. Unite have made it clear they feel they have a deal and they want it honoured. And that could mean strike action for some time to come.

Richard Branson's Caribbean home ruined,"Sir Richard is taking stock after last week's storm Sir Richard Branson says most of the buildings and vegetation on Necker, his Caribbean island, have been destroyed or badly damaged by Hurricane Irma. Necker is among the 50 British Virgin Islands (BVI).Sir Richard says,externalhe has visited the nearest ones to Necker and has seen ""first-hand how ferocious and unforgiving this storm was"". The hurricane killed five people in the territory and the BVI's premier has asked the UK to give long-term support. Sir Richard and his team are safe. Necker's buildings were tossed around by last week's hurricane Hurricane Irma passed through the British Virgin Islands in the middle of last week. He said: ""We felt the full force of the strongest hurricane ever in the Atlantic Ocean. But we are very fortunate to have a strong cellar built into Necker's Great House and were very lucky all of our teams who stayed on Island during the storm are safe and well."" Sir Richard says most of the vegetation on the island is damaged or destroyed He said the ""story is about the tens of thousands of people who have lost their homes and their livelihoods"". Communications are mostly still down in the British Virgin Islands and Sir Richard is currently in Puerto Rico, a few kilometres to the west of the islands. Sir Richard says the ""story is about the tens of thousands of people who have lost their homes and their livelihoods"". He said he was there ""to further mobilise aid efforts and rebuilding plans for the British Virgin Islands and wider Caribbean"". Sir Richard said he would be talking to various governments and aid agencies as well as the media, and would be heading straight back to the British Virgin Islands to continue helping the recovery effort on the ground. The British Virgin Islands is a self-governing British overseas territory with the Queen as its head of state. The British Virgin Islands' premier, Orlando Smith, said they would need long-term help from the UK: ""We are a resilient people but this has shaken us to our core. ""A comprehensive economic package for reconstruction backed by the UK Government will be needed over the long-term in order to return to normalcy,"" The UK has sent military planes, and on Sunday the Royal Navy said locals had helped a helicopter crew unload medical supplies, including vaccines.

Searching for the spirit of Eleanor Rigby,"Eleanor Rigby is listed among the names on a headstone in the graveyard of St Peter's Church, Woolton In a graveyard in Liverpool lies a headstone bearing the name Eleanor Rigby. Its deeds are being auctioned later as part of a sale of Beatles memorabilia, but what is the real story behind the Fab Four's famous hit? It was at a church fete in 1957 that John Lennon and Paul McCartney first met. Just yards away lay the grave of scullery maid Eleanor Rigby, who had died, aged 44, in 1939. Nine years later, McCartney would pen the lyrics for what became one of the band's most celebrated songs. Often described as a lament for the lonely, or a commentary on life in post-war Britain, it tells the story of a woman who ""died in the church and was buried along with her name"". It is tempting to picture the teenage Lennon and McCartney sombrely contemplating the headstone, imagining the life of Eleanor and later dreaming up the lyrics. But the reality is few knew of the grave's existence until the early 1980s, and McCartney himself has denied it was the inspiration behind the song. This hasn't stopped the deeds to the grave being listed for auction with a guide price of Â£4,000. They are part of a sale which also featuresother Beatles itemsand concludes on Thursday. The deeds to Eleanor Rigby's grave were found by a relative David Bedford, who has written several books about the band, said he thought it was ""weird"" there was such interest in a woman seemingly unconnected to the song. ""The score of the song you can understand but a grave, I find it really unusual,"" he said. ""I'm not quite sure who would want to buy the deeds to a grave, and I'll be interested to see who does buy them, and for how much money."" But Mr Bedford said he believed it would be ""too much of a coincidence"" if the grave had never figured in McCartney's mind, at least at some subliminal level. ""The mythology of the grave grows every year,"" he said. Written primarily by McCartney, Eleanor Rigby was released in 1966 as part of a double A-side single which also featured Yellow Submarine The song also formed part of The Beatles' album, Revolver, and the single was released on the same day as the LP The single spent four weeks at number one in the UK charts In the US it reached number 11 and was nominated for three Grammys The song seems to have gone through several stages of development. McCartney said when he first sat down at the piano he had the name Daisy Hawkins in his mind. He later changed this to Eleanor, after the actress Eleanor Bron, who had starred with The Beatles in the film Help! The character's surname at one stage was Bygraves, according to Spencer Leigh, author of The Beatles book Love Me Do to Love Me Don't. But McCartney later changed this to Rigby, from the name of a store he had spotted in Bristol - Rigby & Evens Ltd, Wine & Spirit Shippers. ""I just liked the name,"" he said in 1984. ""I was looking for a name that sounded natural. Eleanor Rigby sounded natural."" Paul McCartney has conceded the grave of Eleanor Rigby may have influenced him in a subconscious way St Peter's Church in Woolton, where the grave of Eleanor Rigby lies In 2008, a birth certificate for the woman buried in the graveyard of St Peter's Church, Woolton, was put up for auction. ""Eleanor Rigby is a totally fictitious character that I made up,"" McCartney said in response. ""If someone wants to spend money buying a document to prove a fictitious character exists, that's fine with me."" However, he has conceded in the past the headstone may have influenced him in a subconscious way. Mr Leigh said it was easy to see how McCartney's childhood visits to the churchyard would have been very memorable for him. ""John Lennon had connections in that church and had even been in the choir there,"" he said. ""[Lennon's] uncle died in 1955 when he was quite young. His name was George Toogood Smith. John loved the name and quite often he would take his friends into the graveyard to show them. ""It's quite possible McCartney saw the Rigby grave and just stored it away in his head. It's just possible that he kept that in his mind. But we actually don't know, and I think McCartney himself doesn't know."" Eleanor Rigby was written primarily by Paul McCartney (far left) and produced by George Martin (second from right) McCartney's score includes notes that there should be four violins, two violas and two cellos Karen Fairweather, from Omega Auctions, conceded the connection between the real Eleanor Rigby and the song was a matter of ""folklore"", none of which was rooted in ""concrete fact"". ""There is of course the gravestone, and the Rigbys lived on the road that backed on to the road where John Lennon lived,"" she added. Yet, whatever the origin of the name, Eleanor Rigby remains an integral part of the band's story and Liverpool's Beatles industry. The gravestone itself is regularly visited by guided tours and an Eleanor Rigby sculpture can be found in Stanley Street. Mr Leigh describes the song as ""perfect"", both in its melodies and its representation of a typical Liverpudlian woman of the time. An Eleanor Rigby sculpture sits on a bench in Liverpool's Stanley Street ""The real Eleanor Rigby worked as a sort of scullery maid,"" Mr Leigh said. ""It just fits so perfectly."" He said the jazz singer George Melly put it best when he said: ""Eleanor Rigby seemed to be written out of their experiences in Liverpool. ""Liverpool was always in their songs but this was about the kind of old woman that I remembered from my childhood and later: very respectable Liverpool women, living in two-up, two-down streets with the doorsteps meticulously holystoned (scoured) and the church the one solid thing in their lives. ""There's the loneliness of it and it struck me as a poem from the start. ""If you read Love Me Do without the music, it doesn't mean much but if you read Eleanor Rigby, it is a poem about someone, which [was] something unprecedented in popular song.""

Laura Kuenssberg: A taste of things to come on Brexit,"The government wants to incorporate EU law into the UK statute book in time for Brexit What is all the fuss about? Listen to ministers and all they are trying to do is tidy up the paperwork, cross the t's and dot the i's. Listen to Labour and Theresa May is trying her luck as a despot, grabbing power in great chunks, never again to give our elected representatives the chance to argue or even consider what's being done on our behalf. Guess what? As ever in politics the truth is somewhere in between, whatever the two sides say. We are leaving the EU in less than two years (pretty much inevitably unless something really surprising happens). But much of our law is based on EU law and EU institutions. So when we leave, in theory we lose lots of law overnight, and much of it simply won't make sense any more in thousands and thousands of areas. Sounds strange, but hypothetically that's what could happen. Right now the EU rules that have over the years been incorporated into our statute books govern everything from chemicals to beaches to immigration to animal welfare to aviation. This list goes on and on, and it is safe to assume EU law shapes pretty much everything. The idea behind the Withdrawal Bill is therefore to cut and paste the lot into British law, so that we don't wake up the morning after we leave the EU in 2019 with a free-for-all. So far, so uncontroversial. Here's the problem. The amount of stuff, the sheer volume of the rules and regulations that need to be transferred is so massive, basically our entire statute book, that the government says there is just no way there will be time to debate it all, let alone vote on every bit. Their solution is to use so-called 'Henry VIII powers', evoking the image of a medieval monarch, ruling by whim and decree. In practice this could mean that on thousands of rules, regulations, ministers can make changes, whether harmless tweaks or suspicious alterations, without having to consult other MPs, let alone give them a vote. Pro-EU demonstrators waved flags outside Parliament as MPs prepared to debate the bill Crucially, it would allow ministers to change things where they think it is ""appropriate"", in theory that makes their decisions even exempt to legal challenge. As it stands, the bill also gives ministers the power to choose the day of our actual exit from the EU, without asking Parliament, and it could also give them the power to designate different days for Brexit in different legal areas. There are therefore clear reasons for there to be nerves on all sides of the House of Commons about the bill. Ministers accept privately that they will probably have to budge in some areas. But tonight's midnight vote is not likely to be the big showdown. Tory rebels will, in the main, vote for the bill in principle, and enter hand-to-hand combat in the more detailed stages in the next couple of months. And although the opposition will vote against the bill this evening, there are also anxious MPs on that side of the House of Commons who won't, worried about appearing to be blocking Brexit by ""killing the bill"". But tonight will be the first real taste of the months to come, the House of Commons sitting until midnight, the government anxiously totting up the numbers, MPs being told to cancel any plans they have to be around for vital votes. Tonight's likely approval of the bill won't wash away the real concerns, and once it makes it to the House of Lords the battles could be even more fraught. PS:Potential Tory rebels might find a little relief in this nugget. Despite reports that the government chief whip, Gavin Williamson, had acquired a second tarantula for his office, the better to torment his charges (yes he does have one), he told me this morning that in fact that is not the case. His spider, Cronus, is still his only office pet. Businesses warn over immigration plan Reality Check: Who are the low-skilled EU workers?

Seeing through the official story in Myanmar,"This video can not be played Who is burning down Rohingya villages? The 300,000 people who have fled Rakhine state to Bangladesh over the past two weeks all come from the northern districts of Maungdaw, Buthidaung and Rathedaung, the last areas of Myanmar with sizeable Rohingya populations not confined to displacement camps. These districts are hard to reach. Roads are poor, and the government requires permits to go there, which journalists rarely get. So we grabbed the opportunity to join a government-organised visit to Maungdaw, for 18 local and foreign journalists. It would mean seeing only places and people they wanted us to see. But sometimes, even under these restrictions, you can glean valuable insights. Besides, the government has arguments that need to be heard. It is now facing an armed insurgency, albeit one some would argue has been self-inflicted. The communal conflict in Rakhine state has a long history, and would be difficult for any government to deal with. A Muslim man sits in a marketplace in Maungdaw, which journalists were allowed to visit only under supervision On arrival at Sittwe, the Rakhine state capital, we were given instructions. No-one was to leave the group and try to work independently. There was a curfew at 6pm, so no wandering after dark. We could request to go to places that interested us; in practice we found such requests were rejected on grounds of security. To be fair, I believe they were genuinely concerned for our safety. Most of the travel in this low-lying region of Myanmar is along the maze of creeks and rivers on crowded boats. The journey from Sittwe to Buthidaung takes six hours. From there we travelled for an hour on a rough road over the Mayu Hills to Maungdaw. As we drove into the town we passed our first burned village, Myo Thu Gyi. Even the palm trees were scorched. A burned Muslim community in Maungdaw The government's purpose in bringing us was to balance the overwhelmingly negative narrative coming from the Rohingya refugees arriving in Bangladesh, who have almost all spoken of a deliberate campaign of destruction by the Myanmar military and Rakhine mobs, and appalling human rights abuses. But right away these efforts faltered. We were first taken to a small school in Maungdaw, now crowded with displaced Hindu families. They all had the same story to tell of Muslims attacking, of fleeing in fear. Oddly, Hindus who have fled to Bangladesh all say they were attacked by local Rakhine Buddhists, because they resemble Rohingyas. In the school we were accompanied by armed police and officials. Could they speak freely? One man started to tell me how soldiers had been firing at his village, and he was quickly corrected by a neighbour. A woman in an orange, lacy blouse and distinctive grey and mauve longyi was especially animated about the abuses by Muslims. A local monk said Muslims burned down their own homes We were then taken to a Buddhist temple, where a monk described Muslims burning down their own homes, nearby. We were given photographs catching them in the act. They looked strange. Men in white haji caps posed as they set light to the palm-thatch roof. Women wearing what appeared to be lacy tablecloths on their heads melodramatically waved swords and machetes. Later I found that one of the women was in fact the animated Hindu woman from the school, and I saw that one of the men had also been present in among the displaced Hindu. They had faked the photos to make it look as though Muslims were doing the burning. Journalists were provided with photos supposedly of Muslims ""caught in the act"" But the BBC later identified the same woman in a Hindu village We had an audience with Colonel Phone Tint, the local minister for border security. He described how Bengali terrorists, as they call the militants of the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army, had taken control of Rohingya villages, and forced them to offer one man per household as a fighter. Those who refused to comply have their houses burned, he said. He accused the militants of planting mines and destroying three bridges. I asked whether he was saying that all of the dozens of burned villages had been destroyed by the militants. He confirmed that was the government's position. Responding to a question about military atrocities, he waved it away. ""Where is the proof?"" he asked.  ""Look at those women,"" he meant the Rohingya refugees, ""who are making these claims - would anyone want to rape them?"" Colonel Phone Tint insists 100% of burned villages have been set on fire by Muslim militants The few Muslims we were able to see in Maungdaw were mostly too scared to talk in front of a camera. Breaking away from our minders, we spoke to some who described the hardship of not being allowed to leave their neighbourhood by the security forces, of food shortages, and intense fear. One young man said they had wanted to flee to Bangladesh, but their leaders had signed an agreement with the authorities to stay. In the now quiet Bengali market, I asked a man what he was frightened of. The government, he said. Weeks after the violence, Alel Than Kyaw was somehow still smouldering The main destination on our itinerary outside Maungdaw was the coastal town of Alel Than Kyaw. This was one of the places attacked by Arsa militants in the early hours of 25 August. As we approached, we passed village after village, all completely empty. We saw boats, apparently abandoned, along with goats and cattle. There were no people. Alel Than Kyaw had been razed to the ground. Even the clinic, with a sign showing it had been run by the charity Medecins Sans Frontieres, had been destroyed. To the north, in the distance we could see four columns of smoke rising, and heard bursts of automatic weapons fire. More villages being put to the torch, we guessed. The MSF charity's clinic was just one of the levelled buildings Police Lieutenant Aung Kyaw Moe described to us how he had been given advance warning of the attack. He had taken the non-Muslim population for protection into his barracks, and his men fought off the assailants - armed, he said, with guns, swords and home-made explosives, for three hours until they were driven off. Seventeen of the militants lay dead, and one immigration officer. The Muslim population fled shortly afterwards. But he struggled to explain why parts of the town were still smouldering, two weeks after the attack, and in the rainy season. Perhaps a few Muslims stayed on, and then set their homes alight before leaving more recently, he suggested half-heartedly. Then, on our way back from Alel Than Kyaw, something entirely unplanned happened. The village of Gaw Du Thar Ya, seen burning by the group We spotted black smoke billowing out of some trees, over the rice fields. It was another village going up, right by the road. And the fires had only just started. We all shouted at our police escort to stop the van. When they did, we just ran, leaving our bewildered government minder behind. The police came with us, but then declared it was unsafe to enter the village. So we went ahead of them. The sound of burning and crackling was everywhere. Women's clothing, clearly Muslim, was strewn on the muddy path. And there were muscular young men, holding swords and machetes, standing on the path, baffled by the sight of 18 sweaty journalists rushing towards them. They tried to avoid being filmed, and two of them dashed further into the village, bringing out the last of their group and making a hasty exit. The village was reduced to charred timber and ashes They said they were Rakhine Buddhists. One of my colleagues managed a quick conversation with one of them, who admitted they had set the houses on fire, with the help of the police. As we walked in, we could see the roof of the madrassa had just been set alight. School texts with Arabic script had been thrown outside. An empty plastic jug, reeking of petrol, had been left on the path. The village was called Gawdu Thar Ya. It was a Muslim village. There was no sign of the inhabitants. The Rakhine men who had torched the village walked out, past our police escort, some carrying household items they had looted. The burning took place close to a number of large police barracks. No-one did anything to stop it. Who is burning down Rohingya villages? Video, 00:03:47Who is burning down Rohingya villages?

Clooney 'felt sick' shooting Suburbicon,"George Clooney is the director of Suburbicon - currently showing at the Toronto Film Festival George Clooney has said he ""felt sick"" while directing some scenes in his new movie Suburbicon. The film's plot sees a black family move into a predominantly white suburban community in the 1950s. ""The trickiest part [of shooting] was, we were in a very racially diverse neighbourhood in Fullerton, California,"" Clooney said. ""And we had about 350 extras who were going to hurl a lot of racial slurs and say a lot of pretty terrible things."" Clooney added: ""Everybody who was making the film, we all just felt sick while we were doing it."" Julianne Moore and Matt Damon (pictured) star in Suburbicon Referring to the way the family is treated in the film, the director said: ""These are things that happened - [neighbours] sang church hymns, they hung confederate flags over the fence, they built a fence around their house, these are things that really happened. ""But it was sickening to be part of it quite honestly, so that was one of the most difficult things to shoot."" The movie, which is currently showing as part of the Toronto Film Festival, was conceived during the run up to the US election of November 2016, which was won by Donald Trump. Clooney said: ""We'd seen some things on the campaign trail where they were talking about building fences, and scapegoating Mexicans and Muslims, and we're always reminded that these aren't new things and new moments in our history. ""So we thought it would be interesting to talk about it, but we wanted the film to be entertaining, not a documentary, we didn't want it to be an eat-your-spinach piece of filmmaking. L-R: Karimah Westbrook, George Clooney, Julianne Moore and Matt Damon ""So we merged it with [an existing Coen Brothers script] Suburbicon, because we thought it was a funnier idea to put it in the suburbs in the 1950s where we all thought everything was perfect - if you were a white straight male."" The actor and director said the real-life political climate the film was shot in ultimately altered the tone of the movie. ""While we were shooting, Trump was elected, and it changed the temperature of the film in a weird way,"" Clooney explained. ""The country got angrier, whichever side you were on. We had to cut some of Josh Brolin's scenes out, and one of the reasons is they were really slapstick funny, and it felt like the wrong tone suddenly."" The film stars Matt Damon, Julianne Moore and Karimah Westbrook - who drew parallels between her character (the mother of the African-American family) and her own experience of the entertainment industry. ""I think early on there was a lot of correlations as far as what I've experienced in Hollywood,"" she said. Karimah Westbrook said diversity in Hollywood had improved more recently ""I wore my hair natural for a very long time, so when I first moved to Hollywood I had an afro, and my manager said 'You'll never work with your hair like that, you'll have to straighten it'. ""I struggled with that for years, my looks, my hair... but I feel like things have changed so much in the industry, we have so many African-American women starring in shows now, so I feel there's been progress, but there's still a lot of things we're facing on both sides.""

The women eating with their families for the first time,"The Damor family now eat all their meals together Meals have a way of bringing families together. As food is laid out, everyone gathers round the table, conversation flows and families bond. But traditionally, eating together has not been encouraged in India. Men and children are fed first and only then can women sit down to eat. But in millions of poor homes, this practice has had an unintended consequence - malnutrition among women. Now, however, campaigners are urging women to eat with their families instead of after them. And, they say, the results have been very encouraging. No-one knows when or where or how the practice started, but like every other symbol of patriarchy, it is deeply entrenched in people's psyche. As a child, in my home too, my mother, grandmother, aunts and cousin's wives would cook and serve, but they would always be the last to eat. In the pecking order, gods came first - once food was prepared, a small portion of all the dishes would be offered to them. In my Brahmin home, even the resident cow was fed before humans - when my grandfather sat down to eat, he would set aside bits of food from every dish onto a small thick round piece of bread that was placed on a leaf. He would eat only after one of us had fed that to the cow. This staggered eating sometimes caused minor friction at home - if men delayed mealtimes, it just meant that the women's wait to eat got longer. It didn't matter how hungry they were, they just had to wait. Manshu Damor also helps by chopping vegetables The locally grown leafy vegetable is high in nutrients Our family was not an exception - this is how my neighbours ate, as did those living across the length and breadth of the country. In many families, a rather unhygienic practice involved women eating from the unwashed plates of their husbands. Anyone who sought an explanation for why this happened was told that it was the norm, that it had happened for centuries, that it was the traditional way. In cities though, it is becoming increasingly common for educated and employed women to eat as and when they want to, but the tradition of women eating last continues to be widely followed to this day, especially in rural areas. Calling your husband by name for the first time In the lion's den: The Indian women who answer cat calls In homes like ours, it has no serious impact because there is enough food to go around. But in poor rural homes, it often leaves women and children hungry. ""This tradition of prioritising men's needs means sometimes when women sit down to eat, there isn't enough left for them,"" says Vandana Mishra of Rajasthan Nutrition Project (RNP), executed by charities Freedom from Hunger India Trust and Grameen Foundation. Karma, Manshu Damor's daughter-in-law, does most of the cooking at their home Campaigners are trying to promote locally grown coarse grain which they say is healthier A survey of 403 poor tribal women in the state's Banswara and Sirohi districts in March 2015 showed ""food secure and food insecure people in the same household"", Ms Mishra said. ""Men always said, 'I go to work first and children go to school, so we need to eat first',"" Rohit Samariya, RNP project manager in Banswara, told the BBC. ""We created plates to demonstrate what a man's plate looked like and what a woman's plate looked like to drive the point home that women were literally scraping the bottom of the barrel,"" he says. To break this pattern, the group came up with a very simple but unusual strategy - to encourage families to eat their meals together. Their two-year project concluded recently and to gauge its impact on rural communities, I travelled last month to the tribal-dominated Ambapara village in Banswara. The family's lunch menu includes vegetable, lentil soup and handmade bread As I arrive at Manshu Damor's house, I find him chopping a type of locally grown leafy vegetable while his wife and daughter-in-law cook in the kitchen behind him. The family's lunch menu includes vegetable, lentil soup and handmade bread. Ambapara is among India's poorest villages where 89% still defecate in the open, child marriages are rampant, literacy levels are low and women still cover their faces in the presence of men. So when the RNP campaigners suggested that people eat their meals together as a family, it was nothing less than revolutionary. Until then, Mr Damor tells me, he had never shared a meal with Barju, his wife of 35 years. The idea that his daughter-in-law Karma could sit alongside him was unthinkable. ""People said how could a woman eat in front of her father-in-law? It had always been against our tradition, so in the beginning I also resisted. I too found it a bit odd,"" he said. Mr Samariya says by asking men to eat together with the women, ""we were asking them to change their behaviour"". ""In our patriarchal society, men are not brought up to care for their wives. So we have to sensitise them to gender issues."" Ramila Damor (front) said her family had their first meal together two years ago It was not just men - women also believed in the same tradition. But after some persuasion, the villagers agreed to give it a try. And, it's made a world of difference to women's well-being. ""I was the one always cooking, but by the time I would sit down to eat, there would be little food left. Men would finish all the vegetables, so I'd have to contend with bread and salt,"" says Karma, Mr Damor's daughter-in-law. ""Now everyone gets equal food."" Her neighbour, Ramila Damor, said her family had their first meal together two years ago. ""When I heard about it for the first time, I went home and cooked and I told my husband that from now on, we'll all eat together. It felt really nice sharing a meal,"" she said. In traditional Indian homes, men are fed first All the other women I spoke to in the village said family meals had become the norm in their homes too. A survey done at the end of the two-year campaign in May showed heartening results - food security among the surveyed women had more than doubled. As the wellbeing of children is often linked to that of mothers, their food security too showed a huge increase. The impact of the campaign was not limited to improving nutrition levels, it brought on other positive changes too. Mr Damor says his daughter-in-law no longer covers her face entirely and the veil has moved up. ""Also, now she calls me Ba (father) instead of Haahoo (dad-in-law) and my wife Aaee (mother) instead of Haaharozi (mum-in-law)."" Meals do have a way of bringing families together. Like they have done in the case of Damors.

The app that inspires tens of millions to go cycling,"Mark Gainey did not let injury stop him from cycling for long Thankfully for tens of millions of cyclists around the world, Mark Gainey didn't walk away from the sport when he had a nasty crash back in 2002. Racing his bike down a steep road in California, he hit a pothole and went flying, shattering his left arm and elbow. He required no fewer than 11 operations to repair the damage. Many of us wouldn't want to look at a bike again after that, but Mark got back in the saddle and a few years later he and a friend came up with the idea for what has become the world's most popular cycling app - Strava. If you aren't a keen cyclist then you may not have heard of it but for those of us who do like pedalling around on two wheels it isn't an exaggeration to say that the app has been revolutionary. Utilising the GPS (global positioning system) software on your smartphone, it enables you to record your ride, and then see an accurate line of the route you have cycled on an electronic map. It tells you how far and fast you have cycled, and you can compare your times over certain sections - such as popular hill climbs - with both how well you have done before and with other Strava users. This means that you can compete to beat other people's times and aim to be ""the king (or queen) of the mountain"" on a certain stretch of road. The Strava app is continuing to see user numbers soar First launched in 2009 and since expanding to running and other sports, Strava now has tens of millions of users around the world, many of whom find it completely addictive. The word Strava is even used as a verb, as in ""I'm going to strava this ride,"" and then there is the saying: ""If it isn't on Strava then it doesn't count."" While it has numerous rivals whose apps do similar things, such as Map My Ride and Endomondo, Strava's user numbers tower over the others. It claims that an additional one million people join every 45 days. But despite its vast popularity and the fact that it is backed by $70m (Â£54m) of investment, the company (which doesn't reveal its financial results) is widely reported to have not yet made a profit. So what is the problem and how can it change it? The app was inspired by the idea to help boost camaraderie among fellow athletes Mark Gainey, 48, says that the original genesis of the idea for San Francisco-based Strava came when he and co-founder Michael Horvath graduated from Harvard University. ""Back in the late 1980s Michael and I rowed together at Harvard. It was an incredible experience, pretty special, with great camaraderie. ""The only problem was that we then graduated and - whoosh - that all just disappeared. ""So brainstorming ideas for businesses we said, 'Wouldn't it be great to replicate that camaraderie in the boathouse.' The idea was to create a virtual locker room for athletes to compare times. Unfortunately the technology just didn't exist at the time."" Cycling groups warn over 'car-dooring' Road tax: The myth that won't die Do cyclists have to be slim to wear Lycra? Fast-forward to 2008 and Mark and Michael, still friends, had not forgotten their idea. By then Mark had spent almost two decades in the software sector, while Michael was a business and economics lecturer who also dabbled in the IT industry. By then technology had made their idea possible, with the invention of GPS recorders and the iPhone and other smartphones. And the likes of Facebook had made people used to sharing information about themselves online. The app has since expanded to running and other sports such as skiing And so the two friends launched Strava, the name being the Swedish word for ""strive"" in reference to Michael's ancestry. The app was an immediate word-of-mouth hit and user numbers soon skyrocketed and haven't slowed since. With its largest number of users in the US followed by the UK and Brazil, commentators put Strava's success compared with its smaller rivals down to a combination of its ease of use, and larger focus on sociability - the ability to see what friends are up to, chat and comment on each other's rides, and give someone ""kudos"" for a good ride. Mark refers to this as Strava's ""secret sauce"", and he has huge ambitions for the company. ""We want to be the trusted sports brand of the 21st Century, but instead of needle and thread it is bits and bytes,"" he says. The financial problem for Strava is that its basic free offering is so good most users aren't tempted to upgrade to its paid-for ""premium"" service. The company won't release the percentage figure for the number of premium users, but commentators say it is likely to be around the 20% mark. Users of the app can upload their own photos As Mark confirms that the company's main revenue stream remains premium subscribers, it needs to see if it can increase this. Strava is also hoping to increase the money it makes from tie-ups with sports firms, and use its data to work with local authorities around the world to improve and increase their provision of bike lanes. To help boost Strava's earning potential, it has recently brought in a new chief executive, James Quarles, who joined from Instagram. The change saw Mark move from that role to chairman. Mark says: ""We want to take Strava from tens of millions [in] revenues to hundreds of millions, and James will lead that."" Mark has switched from chief executive to chairman UK cycling journalist Rebecca Charlton says it is hard to overstate how successfully Strava had turned itself into a ""social network for athletes, a kind of home for their athletic lives"". Meanwhile, US cycling industry commentator Scott Montgomery predicts that Strava will indeed have a profitable future. ""They say in the technology sector that the first is the winner, and the second is forgotten, and Strava has definitely beaten its rivals. ""Somebody has done a great job on the marketing side and the app is very easy to use. They are now at the stage where they own a vast audience, and if you are in that position you will get profitable."" Mark adds: ""We are the world's social network for athletes, but I'm also very pleased that we are simply encouraging more people to be active.""

âI dye my hair brown to be taken seriously at workâ,"A Silicon Valley CEO reveals her secret to getting ahead in business - dyeing her blonde hair brown, and ditching her heels and contact lenses. Eileen Carey is a successful CEO, in her early 30s, with glasses and brown hair. But she didn't always look the way she does now. ""The first time I dyed my hair was actually due to advice I was given by a woman in venture capital,"" she says. Carey was told that the investors she was pitching to would feel more comfortable dealing with a brunette, rather than a blonde woman. ""I was told for this raise [of funds], that it would be to my benefit to dye my hair brown because there was a stronger pattern recognition of brunette women CEOs,"" she explains. Pattern recognition is a theory which suggests people look for familiar experiences - or people - which in turn can make them feel more comfortable with the perceived risks they are taking. When she had blonde hair, Eileen says she was likened to Elizabeth Holmes, whose companyTheranos has been through a lot of controversy. ""Being a brunette helps me to look a bit older and I needed that, I felt, in order to be taken seriously,"" Carey says. Eileen Carey used to have blonde hair and wear contact lenses In interviewing candidates for roles at her startup, Glassbreakers, which provides companies with software aimed at attracting and empowering a diverse workforce,  she's encountered other blonde women who have also dyed their hair brown. ""We discussed that there's the fetishisation of blondes,"" says Carey. ""People are more likely to hit on me in a bar if I'm blonde. There's just that issue in general. ""For me to be successful in this [tech industry] space, I'd like to draw as little attention as possible, especially in any sort of sexual way."" It's not just hair colour either. Carey has swapped her contact lenses for glasses and says she wears loose-fitting ""androgynous"" clothes to work. She says, in a male-dominated working environment, her old look made it more likely she would be flirted with. BBC 100 Womennames 100 influential and inspirational women around the world every year.

Find us onFacebook,external,Instagram,externalandTwitter,externaland use #100Women ""I want to be seen as a business leader and not as a sexual object. Those lines are still crossed very often in this space,"" she explains. Even so, Carey admits that sexual harassment against women in work or other public spaces is all too common. ""There's a problem in our industry, period, around sexual harassment,"" she explains. At a recent party for software company executives, cocktails were served by paid female models, who were ""dressed like fairies"". Being one of the few female CEOs in the room, Carey says she was in the minority when it came to seeing the situation as inappropriate and unprofessional. Glassbreakers provides companies with software aimed at empowering a diverse workforce She says her mother, Eileen Sr, has been a massive influence on the way she approaches masculinity and femininity, and gender issues in general. Both Carey's mother and her aunt were feminists back in the 1980s. ""My mom has short hair, never wears makeup, does not wear high heels, never wears dresses. That's who she has always been,"" Carey says. In the past Carey had her hair blow-dried professionally, her nails manicured. Now she declares herself ""very much my mother's daughter, where I don't like wearing makeup, and I don't like wearing heels. I just like being comfortable at work."" Eileen with natural blonde hair Carey doesn't feel the same pressure to be feminine as women who were brought up in more traditional cultures or households.  ""I was very fortunate that I didn't have those gender stereotypes placed on me at a very young age."" With news stories about sexism and gender in the tech industry - from Uber to Google - dominating the headlines, Carey says employees must remember they have a choice about where they work. According to a2016 survey of Silicon Valley,external, 60% of women working in tech experience unwanted sexual advances Sexual harassment accounted for nearly 30% of the91,503 cases of workplace discrimination complaints filed,externalthat year But there may be many more cases - a2013 poll,externalsuggested 75% of those who experienced sexual harassment at work did not report the incident Trying to change a culture alone from within a company can be difficult she says, and can lead to employees feeling very wounded - leading potentially to ""a million papercuts, the micro-aggressions, the little things"". If you want to try and change a company, then ""Be the change you want to see in the world, which may mean sacrificing your personal life for a discrimination lawsuit. That's unfortunately how you have to change businesses."" Otherwise, she says: ""Go where you are going to be successful."" Companies that aren't inclusive, that don't make spaces for women in leadership, that make it difficult for women to be retained, are not going to win in the long term, she explains. ""Look at the numbers. Look at the leadership. Talk to women who work there. If that doesn't seem like a place that you can reach your highest potential, don't work there.""

The paedophiles who don't want to abuse,"Some paedophiles say they would never abuse children. But what support is there for people like this and how should society treat them to prevent abuse happening? Adam messaged a few days before we were due to meet for the first time. I'll let you know what colour top i'm wearing or something so you can recognise me. Although I'll just be the creepy looking guy :D lol. It was the kind of place that would be packed full of people enjoying two-for-one cocktails on Saturday nights, but Adam just wanted tap water. He was clearly nervous. In his early 20s, but he could pass for younger. Slight and fresh-faced. Brown hair, clear skin and softly spoken. Not ""creepy looking"" at all. He describes himself as ""normal"" and says he likes to hang out with friends, go travelling and play video games. On the surface, it's hard to argue with his self-description. But he has a secret. ""Adam"" isn't his real name. He didn't want us to use that, though he insists he's never done anything illegal. But he is a paedophile. That term is widely used today. It's used interchangeably with child sex abuser by the public - you can find it in many news reports describing the actions of molesters. Concern has steadily grown about the danger of child abuse But academics use the term differently. In the DSM-5, the manual issued by the American Psychiatric Association, and used by psychiatrists across the world, paedophilia is listed as a ""paraphilic disorder"". Effectively, it is defined as a form of mental health condition where an adult has a primary sexual attraction to pre-pubescent children. It doesn't mean that they have abused children, and in fact, psychiatrists and criminologists believe that not all child abusers are paedophiles. Many are motivated by a desire for power or control. People like Adam refer to themselves as ""anti-contact"" paedophiles. They recognise their own attraction to children but understand that is wrong to abuse them. Adam first realised that there was something different about him when he was 13. His friends suddenly started talking about girls and he just wasn't interested. He couldn't reveal the truth. He didn't think about girls at all, but about boys who were younger than him. At that stage, the age gap wasn't dramatic, just a few years. ""As I got older, the age stayed the same and got even younger really."" Adam spent the next few years doing what almost every teenager does - trying to fit in. When he describes this period, his words come out in a rush. ""I felt isolated. I tried to hide it, just tried to ignore it, pretend it wasn't there, pretend I was normal, concentrate on my schoolwork, concentrate on playing football."" Deciding to lie, he pretended to like a girl in his class. Adam knew enough to pick someone who was considered pretty. As he was so shy, no-one really questioned why he didn't ever ask her or anybody else on a date. But Adam wasn't yet at a point where he thought of himself as a paedophile. ""I thought I was too young, really. I thought paedophiles were old men who looked at children."" This has elements of truth in it. The APA says only people aged 16 or older can be classified as paedophiles. There must also be an age gap of five years or more between the subject and the children they are attracted to. Some academics have looked for differences in the brains of paedophiles Prof Derek Perkins is a consultant forensic psychologist and has set up treatment programmes for sexual offenders. ""It's a recognised mental disorder and it's something that people don't choose to have. It's a condition in the same way that someone might have depression or ADHD. ""A lot of people are able to manage it without acting on it."" By the time Adam got to 17, he'd spent four years trying to ignore his feelings about children. Realising this wasn't something he would grow out of, he decided to try to ""solve it"". When he talks about this time in his life, the word he uses most is ""scared"". The other word that comes back is ""normal"". He repeats it as he explains that he had always wanted to have a wife and children one day. But something made him realise this just wasn't possible. ""I got really worried that I'd end up hurting a child and go to prison. My life would be over."" There's a growing body of research into young paedophiles like him, including those who have never been through the legal system. People like Adam have started to form online forums and chat groups where they discuss their struggle. Many of them, including Adam, dislike the word ""paedophile"" because of the way the media uses it interchangeably with ""child rapist"" or ""child abuser"". Instead, he refers to himself as an ""MAP"", which stands for ""minor-attracted person"". Adam seems likeable on the surface. It would be easy to assume he is merely manipulative, trying to project a nice-guy image. I can't speak to his innermost motivation, but I don't think that's the case. When we first met, I asked him to show me photo ID to prove his real name and age. The picture was a few years old, and he had a dodgy haircut. He was able to tease himself for how outdated it looked. He is invariably polite and keen to highlight his intelligence. He mentions that he went to a good university and talks about compliments from his boss. But it's clear he is not a naturally confident person and doesn't find it comfortable speaking to a journalist. He even gets nervous about dealing with public transport. I should say now I am very introverted etc, so at least half the problem isn't me actually trusting you, it's me actually having the courage to meet a stranger to talk to. Was he ever tempted to act on his attraction during puberty? ""I was too shy to do anything, anyway, with anyone. Even if I wasn't a paedophile."" Adam wants to speak to out, he says, because he wants to protect children. He explains that he gets ""so upset"" when he sees stories about child abuse on the news: ""I'm doing this so that some people will stop that."" Adam is very firm on this point. He says he has never abused a child, either online or in person. He doesn't even wait until the end of the question before replying emphatically: ""I would never. I'd never do that."" There's not an ounce of hesitation. He sits upright and doesn't slouch or fidget. He says he would kill himself before hurting a child. And yet when he is asked about the precise nature of his attraction, he starts to become uncomfortable. He squirms, stammers and clams up. He can't get the words out and the conversation moves on. He admits to having ""crushes"" on young boys but he says he works hard to distract himself. In a message, Adam explains his ""age of attraction"". Sorry for not being able to answer when you asked the ages, it's something I was dreading you asking â¦ I hope you understand. My aoa is 1-15, but the emotional side is a lot stronger than the physical side with the lower ages. In person, he uses almost the exact same phrase. ""My age of attraction is one to 15 but as they get younger the emotional attraction is more prominent."" He picks his words carefully, pausing before speaking. By this stage, I had built up a relationship with him. He had opened up about the isolation of his teenage years and his firm resolve to never abuse children. It's difficult to hear him talking about an attraction for very young children. ""I don't really think of a toddler in much of a sexual way, but rather, I want to cuddle one and make sure they're happy. That is mainly it with younger children."" It's hard to avoid being unsettled by this -  and that sense of what is not being said, especially with the qualifiers ""much of a sexual way"" and ""mainly it"". He tries to clarify: ""If you're a parent and you have a toddler, you cuddle them, kiss them, make sure they're fed and safe and happy. And that's kind of the same feeling, but I just get it with all children. Or boys."" But most people want to make sure children are safe and happy. After a slight hesitation, he replies that there is obviously ""some slight attraction"" but that it is drowned out by his emotional response. In Sweden, experiments in drug treatment have been done on paedophiles seeking help There's some debate about the numbers, but it's estimated that between 1% and 5% of men have some form of sexual interest in children. There do exist a small number of female sex offenders, but it is unknown how many of them might be genuine paedophiles.  Although there clearly are women who molest children, a large proportion do so in conjunction with a male offender. Some paedophiles are exclusively attracted to children. Others are also drawn to adults and have ""normal"" relationships with their peers. Adam wishes he was attracted to adults but he just isn't. What has made him like this? It was long thought that paedophiles had typically been abused or had a traumatic event in their own childhoods. But Canadian clinical psychologist James Cantor argues that paedophilia is down to ""cross-wiring"" in the brain. He looked at MRI scans of paedophiles and found that they had less white matter, which links parts of the brain together. Cantor thinks the key is how the brain is formed in the early stages of pregnancy. ""The dream is to prevent it before the paedophile is even born."" Despite his dedication to avoiding contact with children, there was a period when Adam wavered. At about the age of 18, Adam came across ""pro-contact"" paedophiles online. They told him that ""having sexual contact with children is OK, that there's nothing wrong with it and that it doesn't harm the child"". He wanted to believe them. Clearly uncomfortable talking about this period in his life, he sits still, his fingers rubbing together nervously. I ask if he thought he might end up abusing a child. He admits: ""I thought maybe at some point in my life, maybe I would. Not imminently. But I realised, hey this actually hurts children and I don't want to be part of this."" But did he view illegal images of children online? He says that he hasn't. Partly because he wasn't ""tech savvy"" enough to know how to avoid getting caught. That seems a strange explanation. But later, he messages with more context. I guess I wanted to look due to curiosity. I think maybe deep down I knew it was wrong (being pro contact) but I kind of just made myself believe it was ok because I didn't want to be sad and alone for the rest of my life. I guess that's why I didn't follow through or try harder to look, because deep down I knew it was wrong but on the surface I convinced myself it was ok. Other ""anti-contact"" paedophiles tell me they went through similar phases where they thought they would end up offending. One described himself as ""a ticking time bomb"". Adam says he has never blamed himself. ""I didn't choose it. I got unlucky in life. I've never been horrible to anyone, so why has this horrible thing happened to me?"" He says that he was suicidal during that time, but that the feeling is much rarer now. He broke away from the ""pro-contact"" paedophiles after doing more research, and he says he couldn't possibly get any pleasure from looking at illegal images of children. Adam resolved never to abuse a child. StopSO,external(the Specialist Treatment Organisation for the Prevention of Sexual Offending) can work with people who are worried about their sexual thoughts. Stop It Now!,externalis a sexual abuse prevention campaign run by child protection charity The Lucy Faithfull Foundation. It also operates theGet Support,externalwebsite. TheNSPCC,externalspecialises in child protection. TheNational Association for People Abused in Childhood,externaloffers support, advice and guidance to adult survivors of any form of childhood abuse. Childline,externalis a private and confidential service for children and young people up to the age of 19. The Children's Society,externalworks to support vulnerable children in England and Wales. Jake - again not his real name - is another ""anti-contact"" paedophile. He's a year or so younger than Adam, and their stories are remarkably similar. Jake also realised during puberty that he was attracted to younger children - girls aged 5-11. He's also attracted to women his own age. It's not quite as powerful as his feelings towards children, but it gives him hope for his future. Like Adam, he wouldn't stand out in a crowd. He is handsome enough for people to wonder why he is always single. But he is also shy. For our entire conversation, he sits almost totally still with his arms hugged around his body. It doesn't come across as rude - more like he's physically steeling himself for an ordeal. He says the hardest part of being a paedophile is knowing that he is ""one of these people that everyone hates"". But he's clear in his resolve to never abuse children. ""I still have morals. I still know what's good and what's bad. I'm not going to hurt someone like that just to make myself feel better."" Like Adam, he went through a period when he couldn't stop his mind ""justifying things that weren't really justifiable"". So even though he says he was firmly against sexual contact, he decided that ""romantic relationships"" with 11-year-old girls would be acceptable. But he's fuzzy on what he meant by that - only going so far as to mention ""dates and stuff."" But he insists he didn't ever act on those thoughts. At one stage, he thought about going to his GP for help, but decided against it. Despite doctor/patient confidentiality, medics and other professionals have a duty to tell authorities if they think a child has been, or could be, harmed. ""I realised how risky it was. You never really know if they're going to want to report you if they feel like you're a danger."" He felt that his paedophilia was under enough control for him not to pose a threat to any children, but he knew his doctor might not believe him. If he had been able to get professional help, it would have made a big difference, he suggests. ""I wouldn't have gone down kind of the route I did of deluding myself into thinking certain things."" This is something that many of the experts agree with. Prof Derek Perkins says there might be no magic cure for paedophilia, but he is adamant that treatment helps. And that treatment isn't just about helping paedophiles cope with their attraction to children. The primary aim is to reduce the possibility of child sexual abuse. ""From a child protection point of view, the more help that can be provided as early as possible, the better."" Tom Squire, clinical manager of the Lucy Faithfull Foundation, says there isn't enough support. The charity aims to prevent child sexual abuse by working to stop would-be sexual offenders committing a crime in the first place. It runs the Stop It Now helpline. It takes calls from people who are worried about children being sexually abused. That can be anyone from parents and teachers to paedophiles who are concerned about their own thoughts and actions. All callers can stay anonymous. But if they give a real name, and say anything that makes the call handler think a child or anyone else is at risk, the charity will report it to the authorities. The foundation also runs face-to-face sessions for people who have viewed images of abuse or committed abuse. Non-offenders can also be treated but the cost is between Â£700-Â£1000 and there is no anonymity. Another charity, StopSO (the Specialist Treatment Organisation for the Prevention of Sexual Offending), can help paedophiles who have not offended by putting them in contact with a specially trained therapist in their area. But funding  - or the lack of it - is an issue. The cost of treatment is an obstacle to taking it up. StopSO chief executive Juliet Grayson is calling for more government support in the UK. ""Surely prevention is worth investing in, saving lives and money."" The National Association for People Abused in Childhood (NAPAC) has a slightly more nuanced view. It welcomes any work to prevent sexual abuse. But it points out that survivors need support too. Chief Executive Gabrielle Shaw says: ""Support for survivors and victims of abuse is woefully inadequate across the UK. ""This is not an either/or situation, but government and society at large need to realise that more resources are necessary across the piece."" The NSPCC echoes this. It argues that it is ""vital"" to support both potential offenders and any victims. The Home Office acknowledges the need for services. ""It is vital that every effort is made to prevent offending in the first place. We are supportive of efforts in this space and would welcome further innovative work by charities and the private sector to better protect children from harm."" In other words, there seems to be a consensus between government, experts and charities that treating paedophiles would help prevent children being sexually abused. But it's striking that none of the young paedophiles that I've contacted have had any professional help. They seem to get the most support from other paedophiles. Adam credits online forums dedicated to non-offending. He says they help reiterate that offending is wrong. ""I've realised that you can actually be happy, and anti-contact and just be who you are."" Jake agrees that these online groups helped him to become firmly ""anti-contact"". ""It made me realise how bad my thinking was starting to get."" He's certain that he will never offend, insisting over and again that if he ever was tempted, his anti-contact online friends would always push him back ""on to the right path"". His goal is a relationship with a woman his own age. He says the main barrier is that he ""needs to get better at talking to girls"". He kept his paedophilia a complete secret for years, until he had come to terms with it himself. Then, he was able to tell his friends. He says he felt that he needed to ""get it off his chest"". He says the first time he told anyone, it started off almost as a joke. Since then he's told more friends - even accidentally talking about it when he was a ""bit too drunk"". But the people he has told have all taken the news ""surprisingly well"". He explains: ""I mostly kind of say that I'm attracted to people younger than myself, and that I haven't actually hurt anyone and I'm not going to. ""They ask questions and stuff, but I think they believe me."" Adam also told some friends and got a supportive reaction. He says he felt almost high the first time. Telling his mum was much more complicated though. He didn't plan it, but one day she found him crying. She asked him what was wrong but he told her he couldn't talk about it. She thought that maybe he was gay, and asked if it was because he liked men. He said no, so she guessed again. Did he like women? No. And eventually, she asked her son if he liked children? Yes. Adam says she believed that he would never abuse a child.  But she couldn't hide her reaction when he told her that he was attracted to children as young as one. Looking at him tell this story, you realise how slim and slight he is. It reinforces how young he is, even now. Normally he speaks clearly and fluently, but for this, there are long pauses and repetition. ""She... kind of didn't believe meâ¦ She, she, she, erm, she was saying 'That's too young'. ""She had to keep asking me if that was right. Her face was kind of just blank, she was looking at me like completely blankly. As if disbelieving kind of thing. ""She just didn't really believe how young it was. It was horrible. It felt horrible because I didn't want to make her feel bad and I didn't want to be a bad son. ""I just felt so... disgusted with myself I guess. She made me feel like that."" When asked about his hopes for a happy and fulfilled future, Adam bleakly says: ""I don't know."" He's still so young. I point out that he might be totally convinced now that he will never offend, but that he's got a long life ahead of him. But he's firm. ""I've never been one to hurt people in any way, children, adults, anyone. I just don't think I have it in me to hurt anyone.""

Strictly judge predicts same-sex couples,"Revel Horwood said the only issue was ""who's going to go backwards"" Strictly Come Dancing judge Craig Revel Horwood has predicted there will ""probably"" be same-sex couples dancing on the show next year. Prior to the launch show Susan Calmanfaced criticismfor taking part in their absence, and the BBC issued a statement saying they had ""no plans"" to introduce them. But Revel Horwood said he is hopeful. ""In the world of competition there are same-sex couples... so there's no reason why that can't happen."" He continued: ""The Beeb have to decide whether they want to do that one year. I think it will probably happen next year."" Revel Horwood made the comments on ITV's Lorraine show on Monday. ""I think same-sex couples can exist,"" he continued. ""You only have to decide who's going to go backwards really, that's the only difference. ""If you consider the tango was originally danced between two men anyway... It's powerful, explosive, and the same can happen between two women."" Susan Calman admitted to Tess Daly she was a Kevin Clifton superfan Calmanstrongly defendedher decision as an openly gay woman to dance with a male professional dancer on Strictly Come Dancing. The Scottish comedian was partnered up with Kevin Clifton on Saturday's launch show, becoming emotional as she revealed she had a poster of him in her kitchen. The Reverend Richard Coles - who was paired with new professional dancer Dianne Buswell - has also said he would be more than happy to dance with a male partner.

Parents remove son in boy-in-dress row,"This video can not be played Sally and Nigel Rowe say their child came home from school confused and unhappy The parents of a six-year-old boy have removed him from his primary school in a row over whether another pupil should be allowed to wear a dress. Nigel and Sally Rowe said their son was confused as to why the child at the Church of England School on the Isle of Wight dressed as both a boy and a girl. The Diocese of Portsmouth, under which the school falls, said it was required to ""respect diversity of all kinds"". The couple believe the school should have consulted all parents. Mrs Rowetold the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programmethat when they spoke with the school, which is not being identified, they were told ""if a child wants to do that then we just have to accept it"". The couple said under the school's bullying policy their son faced being disciplined for misidentifying the gender of the six-year-old pupil. Trans children: Preparing for puberty School adopts gender neutral uniform What does legally changing gender involve? Two years ago they removed their eldest son from the same school in a separate row about a different child with gender identity issues. The Rowes say the suggestion that gender is fluid conflicts with their Christian beliefs and they are seeking a legal challenge against the school's actions. The Christian Legal Centre, which is supporting Mr and Mrs Rowe, said the couple were being accused of ""transphobic behaviour"" because of their ""refusal to acknowledge a transgender person's true gender"". Mr Rowe said: ""I am shocked by the suggestion, especially from a church school, that just because we question the notion that a six-year-old boy can really become a girl, we are transphobic."" She added:: ""We believe he [the older boy] was under stress by the confusion that was caused by having a boy in his class that decided that they were going to have a girl's name and dress as a girl."" There is no specific law dictating uniforms. Schools are free to set their own rules as long as they don't breach human rights and equality legislation; in other words, they cannot discriminate on the basis of gender, race, disability, sexual orientation or faith. Under the Human Rights Act, schools must also make sure that no child is prevented from accessing education due to their uniform rules. It's more common for schools or employers to be challenged over dress codes when people are prevented from wearing something, for instance a hijab or a crucifix necklace, rather than because they have permitted something - in this case for a boy to wear the regulation girls' uniform. This case is unusual because the parents taking legal action are protesting against a form of uniform being permitted rather than prohibited, and because their child is not the party being directly affected by the rules. This is likely to make their case harder to argue. It will all come down to competing rights - for both children to freely access education and not to be discriminated against. Source: BBC Reality Check Jeff Williams, director of education for the Diocese of Portsmouth, said: ""Church of England schools are inclusive environments where pupils learn to respect diversity of all kinds. ""Like any other state school, our schools comply with the legal requirements of the Equalities Act 2010. ""Among other things, this requires schools to accept the wishes of children and their families with regard to gender identity. It would be unlawful for any of our schools to do otherwise."" Mr and Mrs Rowe say the school's handling of the situation did not show proper regard for the possible long-term emotional and psychological effects for the two young children seeking to change gender, or for the confusion and concern caused to other people by the suggestion that boys are not always boys, and girls are not always girls. LGBT campaigner Jane Fae, who is transgender, said Mr and Mrs Rowe had misjudged the issue, as children with gender issues needed sympathy to help prevent them being bullied. She said: ""I have a child who took a lot of bullying on my behalf and that bullying was exactly the same: it was parents saying 'we have a right to an opinion' and they told their children their opinion, and having told their children their opinion, their children thought it was open season on bullying my son.""

Murder arrest after festival death,"The festival was held at Lulworth Castle A man has been arrested on suspicion of murder after a woman was found dead at a festival in Dorset. The body of the 25-year-old was discovered in a wooded area at the edge of the Bestival site in Dorset in the early hours. Police said they were called shortly before 01:00 BST amid concern for welfare of the woman, from London. A 28-year-old man from London has been arrested on suspicion of murder and is being questioned by police. A cordon remains in place at the festival site while forensic examinations take place. Dorset Police said the woman's family and the coroner had been informed. A post-mortem examination is to be carried out to establish the cause of death. Det Ch Insp Sarah Derbyshire said: ""Following the discovery of the woman's body we have now launched an investigation into her death. We have specially trained officers supporting her family at this very difficult time. ""We are working closely with the festival organisers and I would appeal to anyone with any information about the incident to contact Dorset Police.""

Parents remove son in transgender row,"This video can not be played Sally and Nigel Rowe say their child came home from school confused and unhappy The parents of a six-year-old boy have removed him from his primary school in a row over whether another pupil should be allowed to wear a dress. Nigel and Sally Rowe said their son was confused as to why the child at the Church of England School on the Isle of Wight dressed as both a boy and a girl. The Diocese of Portsmouth, under which the school falls, said it was required to ""respect diversity of all kinds"". The couple believe the school should have consulted all parents. Mrs Rowetold the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programmethat when they spoke with the school, which is not being identified, they were told ""if a child wants to do that then we just have to accept it"". The couple said under the school's bullying policy their son faced being disciplined for misidentifying the gender of the six-year-old pupil. Trans children: Preparing for puberty School adopts gender neutral uniform What does legally changing gender involve? Two years ago they removed their eldest son from the same school in a separate row about a different child with gender identity issues. The Rowes say the suggestion that gender is fluid conflicts with their Christian beliefs and they are seeking a legal challenge against the school's actions. The Christian Legal Centre, which is supporting Mr and Mrs Rowe, said the couple were being accused of ""transphobic behaviour"" because of their ""refusal to acknowledge a transgender person's true gender"". Mr Rowe said: ""I am shocked by the suggestion, especially from a church school, that just because we question the notion that a six-year-old boy can really become a girl, we are transphobic."" She added:: ""We believe he [the older boy] was under stress by the confusion that was caused by having a boy in his class that decided that they were going to have a girl's name and dress as a girl."" There is no specific law dictating uniforms. Schools are free to set their own rules as long as they don't breach human rights and equality legislation; in other words, they cannot discriminate on the basis of gender, race, disability, sexual orientation or faith. Under the Human Rights Act, schools must also make sure that no child is prevented from accessing education due to their uniform rules. It's more common for schools or employers to be challenged over dress codes when people are prevented from wearing something, for instance a hijab or a crucifix necklace, rather than because they have permitted something - in this case for a boy to wear the regulation girls' uniform. This case is unusual because the parents taking legal action are protesting against a form of uniform being permitted rather than prohibited, and because their child is not the party being directly affected by the rules. This is likely to make their case harder to argue. It will all come down to competing rights - for both children to freely access education and not to be discriminated against. Source: BBC Reality Check Jeff Williams, director of education for the Diocese of Portsmouth, said: ""Church of England schools are inclusive environments where pupils learn to respect diversity of all kinds. ""Like any other state school, our schools comply with the legal requirements of the Equalities Act 2010. ""Among other things, this requires schools to accept the wishes of children and their families with regard to gender identity. It would be unlawful for any of our schools to do otherwise."" Mr and Mrs Rowe say the school's handling of the situation did not show proper regard for the possible long-term emotional and psychological effects for the two young children seeking to change gender, or for the confusion and concern caused to other people by the suggestion that boys are not always boys, and girls are not always girls. LGBT campaigner Jane Fae, who is transgender, said Mr and Mrs Rowe had misjudged the issue, as children with gender issues needed sympathy to help prevent them being bullied. She said: ""I have a child who took a lot of bullying on my behalf and that bullying was exactly the same: it was parents saying 'we have a right to an opinion' and they told their children their opinion, and having told their children their opinion, their children thought it was open season on bullying my son.""

A taste of things to come on Brexit,"The government wants to incorporate EU law into the UK statute book in time for Brexit What is all the fuss about? Listen to ministers and all they are trying to do is tidy up the paperwork, cross the t's and dot the i's. Listen to Labour and Theresa May is trying her luck as a despot, grabbing power in great chunks, never again to give our elected representatives the chance to argue or even consider what's being done on our behalf. Guess what? As ever in politics the truth is somewhere in between, whatever the two sides say. We are leaving the EU in less than two years (pretty much inevitably unless something really surprising happens). But much of our law is based on EU law and EU institutions. So when we leave, in theory we lose lots of law overnight, and much of it simply won't make sense any more in thousands and thousands of areas. Sounds strange, but hypothetically that's what could happen. Right now the EU rules that have over the years been incorporated into our statute books govern everything from chemicals to beaches to immigration to animal welfare to aviation. This list goes on and on, and it is safe to assume EU law shapes pretty much everything. The idea behind the Withdrawal Bill is therefore to cut and paste the lot into British law, so that we don't wake up the morning after we leave the EU in 2019 with a free-for-all. So far, so uncontroversial. Here's the problem. The amount of stuff, the sheer volume of the rules and regulations that need to be transferred is so massive, basically our entire statute book, that the government says there is just no way there will be time to debate it all, let alone vote on every bit. Their solution is to use so-called 'Henry VIII powers', evoking the image of a medieval monarch, ruling by whim and decree. In practice this could mean that on thousands of rules, regulations, ministers can make changes, whether harmless tweaks or suspicious alterations, without having to consult other MPs, let alone give them a vote. Pro-EU demonstrators waved flags outside Parliament as MPs prepared to debate the bill Crucially, it would allow ministers to change things where they think it is ""appropriate"", in theory that makes their decisions even exempt to legal challenge. As it stands, the bill also gives ministers the power to choose the day of our actual exit from the EU, without asking Parliament, and it could also give them the power to designate different days for Brexit in different legal areas. There are therefore clear reasons for there to be nerves on all sides of the House of Commons about the bill. Ministers accept privately that they will probably have to budge in some areas. But tonight's midnight vote is not likely to be the big showdown. Tory rebels will, in the main, vote for the bill in principle, and enter hand-to-hand combat in the more detailed stages in the next couple of months. And although the opposition will vote against the bill this evening, there are also anxious MPs on that side of the House of Commons who won't, worried about appearing to be blocking Brexit by ""killing the bill"". But tonight will be the first real taste of the months to come, the House of Commons sitting until midnight, the government anxiously totting up the numbers, MPs being told to cancel any plans they have to be around for vital votes. Tonight's likely approval of the bill won't wash away the real concerns, and once it makes it to the House of Lords the battles could be even more fraught. PS:Potential Tory rebels might find a little relief in this nugget. Despite reports that the government chief whip, Gavin Williamson, had acquired a second tarantula for his office, the better to torment his charges (yes he does have one), he told me this morning that in fact that is not the case. His spider, Cronus, is still his only office pet. Businesses warn over immigration plan Reality Check: Who are the low-skilled EU workers?

Seven dead in Dallas home shooting,"Police vehicles arriving at the scene of the shooting, in the Dallas suburb of Plano A gunman has killed eight people at a home in Dallas, Texas, before being shot dead by police. Two further shooting victims are in hospital after they were injured at the property on Sunday night. Police spokesman David Tilley said the shooter was killed by the first responding officer after an exchange of gunfire. The officer was not injured. It is not yet clear what motivated the attack in the suburb of Plano, or if the gunman knew the victims. ""We're trying to put all the puzzle pieces together,"" Mr Tilley said. The localDallas News,externalreported that those killed had been watching the Dallas Cowboys, an American Football team, when the violence unfolded. The outlet quoted a neighbour, Stacey Glover, who said there had been a game-watching party at the property that started early in the afternoon, with people laughing and grilling food outside.

How Chinese mulberry bark led to paper money,"Almost 750 years ago, a young Venetian merchant named Marco Polo wrote a remarkable book chronicling his travels in China. The Book of the Marvels of the World was full of strange foreign customs that Marco claimed to have seen. But there was one that was so extraordinary, Marco Polo could barely contain himself: ""Tell it how I might,"" he wrote, ""you never would be satisfied that I was keeping within truth and reason."" What had excited Marco so much? He was one of the first Europeans to witness an invention that remains at the foundation of the modern economy: paper money. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world in which we live. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. Of course, the paper itself isn't the point. Modern paper money isn't made of paper - it's made of cotton fibres or plastic. And the Chinese money that so fascinated Marco Polo wasn't quite paper either. It was made from a black sheet derived from the bark of mulberry trees, signed by multiple officials and, with a seal smothered in bright red vermilion, authenticated by the Chinese emperor Kublai Khan himself. Kublai Khan announced that officially stamped mulberry bark was money - and lo, it was The chapter of Marco Polo's book was titled, somewhat breathlessly: ""How the great Khan Causes the Bark of Trees, Made into Something Like Paper, to Pass for Money All over His Country"". The point is, that whatever these notes were made of, their value didn't come from the preciousness of the substance, as with a gold or silver coin. Instead, the value was created purely by the authority of the government. Paper money is sometimes called fiat money - the Latin word ""fiat"" means ""let it be done"". The Great Khan announces that officially stamped mulberry bark is money - and lo, let it be done. Money it is. The genius of this system amazed Marco Polo, who explained that the paper money circulated as though it were gold or silver itself. Where was all the gold that wasn't circulating? Well, the emperor kept a tight hold of that. The Mulberry money itself wasn't new when Marco Polo heard about it. It had emerged nearly three centuries earlier, around the year 1000 in Sichuan, China. Sichuan was a frontier province, bordered by foreign and sometimes hostile states. China's rulers didn't want valuable gold and silver currency to leak into foreign lands, and so they imposed a bizarre rule. Sichuan had to use coins made of iron. These Chinese coins dating back to the Song Dynasty (960-1279) were found in 2005 Iron coins aren't terribly practical. If you traded in a handful of silver coins - 50g worth - you'd be given your own body weight in iron coins. Even something simple like salt was worth more, gram for gram, than iron - so if you went to the market for groceries, your sackful of coins on the way there would weigh more than the bag of goods that you brought back. Sichuan merchants had a problem, as William Goetzmann explains in his book Money Changes Everything. It was illegal to use gold and silver coins, and impractical to use iron coins. It's no surprise that they began to experiment with an alternative. That alternative was called ""jiaozi"", or ""exchange bills"". Instead of carrying around a wagonload of iron coins, a well-known and trusted merchant would write an IOU, and promise to pay his bill later when it was more convenient for everyone. That was a simple enough idea. But then there was a twist, a kind of economic magic. These ""jiaozi"", or IOUs, started to trade freely. The warrior monks who invented banking What makes gambling wrong but insurance right? How the invention of paper changed the world What tally sticks tell us about how money works Suppose I supply some goods to the eminently reputable Mr Zhang, and he gives me an IOU. When I go to your shop later, rather than paying you with iron coins - who does that? - I could write you an IOU. But it might be simpler - and indeed you might prefer it - if instead I give you Mr Zhang's IOU. After all, we both know he's good for the money. Now you, and I, and Mr Zhang, have together created a kind of primitive paper money - it's a promise to repay that has a marketable value of its own - and can be passed around from person to person without being redeemed. This is very good news for Mr Zhang, because as long as people keep finding it convenient simply to pass on his IOU as a way of paying for things, Mr Zhang never actually has to stump up the iron coins. Effectively, he enjoys an interest-free loan for as long as his IOU continues to circulate. Better still, it's a loan that he may never be asked to repay. A fragment of one of the earliest surviving banknotes, which was printed in the early 1260s No wonder the Chinese authorities started to think these benefits ought to accrue to them, rather than to the likes of Mr Zhang. At first they regulated the issuance of jiaozi, but then outlawed private jiaozi and took over the whole business themselves. The official jiaozi currency was a huge hit, circulating across regions and even internationally. In fact, the jiaozi even traded at a premium, because they were so much easier to carry around than metal coins. Initially, the government-issued jiaozi could be redeemed for coins on demand, exactly as the private jiaozi had been. This was logical: it treated the paper notes as a placeholder for something of real value. But the government soon moved stealthily to a fiat system, maintaining the principle but abandoning the practice of redeeming jiaozi for metal. Bring an old jiaozi in to the government treasury to be redeemed, and you would receive a crisp new jiaozi. That was a very modern step. The money we use today all over the world is created by central banks and it's backed by nothing in particular except the promises to replace old notes with fresh ones. The oldest known British bank note, issued by the Bank of England in 1699 We've moved from a situation where Mr Zhang's IOU circulates without ever being redeemed, to the mind-bending situation where the government's IOUs circulate despite never being redeemed. For governments, fiat money represents a temptation: a government with bills to pay can simply print more money. And when more money chases the same amount of goods and services, prices tend to go up. The temptation quickly proved too great to resist. The Song dynasty issued too many jiaozi. Counterfeiting was also a problem. Within a few decades of its invention in the early 11th century, jiaozi was devalued and discredited, trading at just 10% of its face value. Other countries have since suffered much worse. Weimar Germany and Zimbabwe are famous examples of economies collapsing into chaos as excessive money-printing rendered prices meaningless. Zimbabwe has seen extraordinarily high inflation The abysmal world record for hyperinflation is held by Hungary in 1946, where prices trebled during the course of every day. Walk into a Budapest cafe back then, and it was better to pay for your coffee when you arrived, not when you left. These rare but terrifying episodes have convinced some economic radicals that fiat money can never be stable. They yearn for a return to the days of the gold standard, when paper money could always be redeemed for a little piece of the precious metal held inside Fort Knox. Gold has been used as currency for thousands of years But mainstream economists generally now believe that pegging the money supply to gold is a terrible idea. Most regard low and predictable inflation as no problem at all - perhaps even a useful lubricant to economic activity. And while we may not always be able to trust central bankers to print just the right amount of new money, it probably makes more sense than trusting miners to dig up just the right amount of new gold. The ability to fire up the printing presses is especially useful in crisis situations. After the 2007 financial crisis, the US Federal Reserve pumped trillions of dollars into the economy, without creating inflation. In fact, the printing presses were metaphorical: those trillions were simply created by key-strokes on computers in the global banking system. As a wide-eyed Marco Polo might have put it: ""The great Central Bank Causes the Digits on a Computer Screen, Made into Something Like Spreadsheets, to Pass for Money"". Technology has changed, but what passes for money continues to astonish.

Cycle groups warn over 'car-dooring',"This video can not be played A driving instructor explains how the 'Dutch reach' works A campaign to raise awareness of ""car-dooring"" is needed to save lives on Britain's roads, Cycling UK has said. The campaign group says cyclists, motorcyclists and pedestrians are being injured and killed by drivers and their passengers carelessly opening doors. It wants the Dutch reach - which involves opening doors with the ""wrong"" hand - to be taught to new drivers. The Department for Transport says it will consider new messages on cycle safety as part of its Think! campaign. Government figures from 2011-2015 show that eight people died from carelessly-opened car doors. Three of these had been travelling in cars - five were cyclists knocked off their bikes. The app that inspires cycling Cycling to work 'halves cancer risk' Do you have to be slim to wear Lycra? In total 3,108 people were reported hurt but Cycling UK believes the true figure is probably much higher. It's suggesting an information campaign, warning cyclists to ride further into the carriageway, to avoid the swing of car doors. It also wants higher fines for careless door opening. And it's urging ministers to have the ""Dutch reach"" taught in driving tests. This manoeuvre involves the driver or passenger on the right-hand side of the car opening the door with the left hand - forcing them to turn and see if anyone's approaching. It's a mandatory part of Dutch driving tests. A video of the technique has been seen by more than a million people on the ""Outside"" magazine website. The idea has been supported by Cambridgeshire Police and Crime Commissioner Jason Ablewhite, who said: ""This simple step seems like a good way of checking that a cyclist is not approaching and reducing the risk of 'dooring', particularly in a congested city."" The Department for Transport previously dismissed the proposal - but that was just after the Transport Secretary Chris Grayling was filmed havingknocked a cyclist off his bike opening a car door. Mr Grayling apologised to the cyclist who he said was not badly hurt. Dramatic footage posted on YouTube shows Olukayode Ibrahim colliding with a car door in London on a Sunday afternoon in September last year. ""I was heading to work in Leicester Square. The cars on the road ahead had been stopped by a traffic light and I rode up beside them. ""All of a sudden, the passenger door of a VW Golf opened directly in front of me. There was nothing I could do but to brace for the worst as my mind almost blanked,"" Mr Ibrahim said. ""The impact came in seconds and resulted in me slamming into the inside of the car door while at the same time landing almost on top of the passenger who was exiting the car. ""Initially I was trapped as the brake lever punctured the upholstery of the car door and got stuck while the cleats on my pedals didn't disengage immediately. ""With the help of sympathisers, I was able to free myself and my bike. The owner of the car accepted liability. ""During the course of discussing the incident with the VW owner, I voiced my displeasure at the reckless manner in which the car door had been opened. ""I sustained a sprained left wrist which was painful for a couple of months. ""The worst part of the experience was the knowledge of what was about to happen when the car door opened and knowing that there is nothing I could do about it and the fact that I didn't know what would be on the other side"" he added. Cycling UK is hoping that the new minister, Jesse Norman - a keen cyclist - will take a broader look at cycle safety in the light of the incident in which young mother Kim Briggs was killed by acyclist on an illegal bike. The group says all road users should be given better protection from the reckless acts of others. Car-dooring will enter the spotlight on 22 September at Leicester Crown Court when it hears an appeal over the death of Sam Boulton. He was a schoolteacher who died when he was knocked into the path of a van after being hit by a taxi passenger door. The passenger, Mandy Chapple, pleaded guilty and was fined Â£80, but the driver, Farook Yusuf Bhikhu, is appealing against conviction: he says he didn't give permission for the door to be opened. The maximum fine for car-dooring is Â£1,000 - even if the victim is killed as a result. Cycling UK says the fine does not reflect the seriousness of the offence. Mr Boulton's father, Jeff, said: ""It's heart-breaking that an offence which has ended a life and caused untold trauma for my family be treated so lightly under current legislation. ""Until we have an appropriate offence in law, I call on the government to start investigating how they can better educate and train drivers about the dangers of car-dooring."" AA president Edmund King told BBC News he supported any campaign to improve safety between cars and bikes. He said the AA was still handing outwing mirror ""Think Bike"" stickers,externalto jog drivers' attention. ""It's a good idea to get cyclists better educated too,"" he said. ""It's much safer cycling some way into the road because if you cycle next to the kerb you've got car doors to worry about and you're much more likely to have to swerve to avoid a pothole or a dropped manhole cover."" Mr King said driving instructors for BSM and the AA already typically taught the opposite hand door-opening method. A government source, commenting on the proposal for teaching the Dutch reach, suggested ministers might be unwilling to prescribe a manoeuvre that would be ridiculed in parts of the media - but suggested that cycle safety groups might make more headway on this matter themselves. A spokesman for the DfT told BBC News: ""From 2012-2015, Think! worked in partnership with Transport for London to extend their cycle safety 'tips' to cyclists and motorists in other cities. ""This included the advice to 'Always check for cyclists when you open your car door'. ""In 2016, Think! launched a new cycle safety campaign targeting commuter cyclists and HGV drivers.""

Florida to begin huge relief operation,"This video can not be played Strong winds and rain have been battering Florida Relief operations are under way in Florida, as the extent of the damage from Hurricane Irma becomes clear. More than 6.5m homes - two-thirds 62% of the state - are without power.

Before and after in Brickell, Miami By Jane O'Brien, BBC News, Miami Miami dodged a bullet by and large. The eye of the storm did not hit the city but it did wallop the Florida Keys, of course, and that is where the concern is now. Communications were pretty bad even on Friday.

Offshore wind cheaper than new nuclear,"Energy from offshore wind in the UK will be cheaper than electricity from new nuclear power for the first time. The cost of subsidies for new offshore wind farms has halved since the last 2015 auction for clean energy projects Two firms said they were willing to build offshore wind farms for a guaranteed price of Â£57.50 per megawatt hour for 2022-23. This compares with the new Hinkley Point C nuclear plant securing subsidies of Â£92.50 per megawatt hour. Nuclear firms said the UK still needed a mix of low-carbon energy, especially for when wind power was not available. The figures for offshore wind, from the Department for Business, Energy and Industrial Strategy, were revealed as the result of an auction for subsidies, in which the lowest bidder wins. In the auction in 2015, offshore wind farm projects won subsidies between Â£114 and Â£120 per megawatt hour. Emma Pinchbeck, from the wind energy trade body Renewable UK, told the BBC the latest figures were ""truly astonishing"". ""We still think nuclear can be part of the mix - but our industry has shown how to drive costs down, and now they need to do the same."" Bigger turbines, higher voltage cables and lower cost foundations, as well as growth in the UK supply chain and the downturn in the oil and gas industry have all contributed to falling prices. The newest 8 megawatt offshore turbines stand almost 200 metres high, taller than London's Gherkin building. But Ms Pinchbeck said the turbines would double in size in the 2020s. However, the nuclear industry said that because wind power is intermittent, nuclear energy would still be needed. Tom Greatrex, chief executive of the Nuclear Industry Association, said: ""It doesn't matter how low the price of offshore wind is. On last year's figures it only produced electricity for 36% of the time."" EDF, which is building the Hinkley Point C nuclear plant, said the UK still needed a ""diverse, well-balanced"" mix of low-carbon energy. ""New nuclear remains competitive for consumers who face extra costs in providing back-up power when the wind doesn't blow or the sun doesn't shine,"" the French firm said. ""There are also costs of dealing with excess electricity when there is too much wind or sun."" EDF added that energy from new nuclear plants would become cheaper as the market matures, as has happened with offshore wind. Eyes will be raised at this suggestion, as nuclear power has already received subsidies since the 1950s. But storage of surplus energy from offshore wind is still a challenge. Onshore wind power and solar energy are already both cost-competitive with gas in some places in the UK. And the price of energy subsidies for offshore wind has now halved in less than three years. Energy analysts said UK government policy helped to lower the costs by nurturing the fledgling industry, then incentivising it to expand - and then demanding firms should bid in auction for their subsidies. Minister for Energy and Industry Richard Harrington said: ""We've placed clean growth at the heart of the Industrial Strategy to unlock opportunities across the country, while cutting carbon emissions. ""The offshore wind sector alone will invest Â£17.5bn in the UK up to 2021 and thousands of new jobs in British businesses will be created by the projects announced today."" This video can not be played World's first floating offshore wind farm in Scotland Michael Grubb, professor of energy policy at University College London, called the cost reduction ""a huge step forward in the energy revolution"". ""It shows that Britain's biggest renewable resource - and least politically problematic - is available at reasonable cost. ""It'll be like the North Sea oil and gas industry: it started off expensive, then as the industry expanded, costs fell. We can expect offshore wind costs to fall more, too,"" he said. The subsidies, paid from a levy on consumer bills, will run for 15 years - unlike nuclear subsidies for Hinkley C which run for 35 years. This adds to the cost advantage offshore wind has now established over new nuclear. Prof Grubb estimated the new offshore wind farms would supply about 2% of UK electricity demand, with a net cost to consumers of under Â£5 per year. Caroline Lucas, co-leader of the Green Party, said: ""This massive price drop for offshore wind is a huge boost for the renewables industry and should be the nail in the coffin for new nuclear. ""The government's undying commitment to new nuclear risks locking us into sky high prices for years to come. Put simply, this news should be the death knell for Hinkley C nuclear station."" Construction of the Hinkley Point plant is under way after government approval last year Along with three offshore wind farm projects, biomass and energy from waste plants have secured subsidies for low-carbon energy, with a total of 11 successful schemes in the latest auction. The Â£57.50 for new offshore wind power is not a true subsidy. It is a ""strike price"" - a guaranteed price to the generating firm for power it supplies. When the wholesale market price for electricity is below that price, payments to the firm are made up with a levy on consumers. However, when the wholesale price is above the strike price, the generator pays the difference back. It is a way of providing a certain return on investment for large energy projects. It is impossible to predict what the final additional cost to consumers will be because it depends on market conditions, but it will almost certainly be a fraction of the strike price itself. Experts warn that in order to meet the UK's long term climate goals, additional sources of low-carbon energy will still be needed. Follow Roger on Twitter @rharrabin.

Florida's Director of Emergency Management, Bryan Koon, said late in Sunday he could not yet confirm or deny reports of multiple deaths and extensive damage. Search and rescue efforts are due to begin on Monday morning, he said. Irma cut a devastating track across 10 Caribbean countries and territories, killing at least 28 people there. President Donald Trump has approved a major disaster declaration and emergency federal aid for Florida, describing the hurricane as a ""big monster"".

Parents remove son over transgender row,"This video can not be played Sally and Nigel Rowe say their child came home from school confused and unhappy The parents of a six-year-old boy have removed him from his primary school in a row over whether another pupil should be allowed to wear a dress. Nigel and Sally Rowe said their son was confused as to why the child at the Church of England School on the Isle of Wight dressed as both a boy and a girl. The Diocese of Portsmouth, under which the school falls, said it was required to ""respect diversity of all kinds"". The couple believe the school should have consulted all parents. Mrs Rowetold the BBC's Victoria Derbyshire programmethat when they spoke with the school, which is not being identified, they were told ""if a child wants to do that then we just have to accept it"". The couple said under the school's bullying policy their son faced being disciplined for misidentifying the gender of the six-year-old pupil. Trans children: Preparing for puberty School adopts gender neutral uniform What does legally changing gender involve? Two years ago they removed their eldest son from the same school in a separate row about a different child with gender identity issues. The Rowes say the suggestion that gender is fluid conflicts with their Christian beliefs and they are seeking a legal challenge against the school's actions. The Christian Legal Centre, which is supporting Mr and Mrs Rowe, said the couple were being accused of ""transphobic behaviour"" because of their ""refusal to acknowledge a transgender person's true gender"". Mr Rowe said: ""I am shocked by the suggestion, especially from a church school, that just because we question the notion that a six-year-old boy can really become a girl, we are transphobic."" She added:: ""We believe he [the older boy] was under stress by the confusion that was caused by having a boy in his class that decided that they were going to have a girl's name and dress as a girl."" There is no specific law dictating uniforms. Schools are free to set their own rules as long as they don't breach human rights and equality legislation; in other words, they cannot discriminate on the basis of gender, race, disability, sexual orientation or faith. Under the Human Rights Act, schools must also make sure that no child is prevented from accessing education due to their uniform rules. It's more common for schools or employers to be challenged over dress codes when people are prevented from wearing something, for instance a hijab or a crucifix necklace, rather than because they have permitted something - in this case for a boy to wear the regulation girls' uniform. This case is unusual because the parents taking legal action are protesting against a form of uniform being permitted rather than prohibited, and because their child is not the party being directly affected by the rules. This is likely to make their case harder to argue. It will all come down to competing rights - for both children to freely access education and not to be discriminated against. Source: BBC Reality Check Jeff Williams, director of education for the Diocese of Portsmouth, said: ""Church of England schools are inclusive environments where pupils learn to respect diversity of all kinds. ""Like any other state school, our schools comply with the legal requirements of the Equalities Act 2010. ""Among other things, this requires schools to accept the wishes of children and their families with regard to gender identity. It would be unlawful for any of our schools to do otherwise."" Mr and Mrs Rowe say the school's handling of the situation did not show proper regard for the possible long-term emotional and psychological effects for the two young children seeking to change gender, or for the confusion and concern caused to other people by the suggestion that boys are not always boys, and girls are not always girls. LGBT campaigner Jane Fae, who is transgender, said Mr and Mrs Rowe had misjudged the issue, as children with gender issues needed sympathy to help prevent them being bullied. She said: ""I have a child who took a lot of bullying on my behalf and that bullying was exactly the same: it was parents saying 'we have a right to an opinion' and they told their children their opinion, and having told their children their opinion, their children thought it was open season on bullying my son.""

UN sees 'ethnic cleansing' in Myanmar,"This video can not be played Aid agencies say Rohingya refugees from Myanmar are in desperate need of aid The security operation targeting Rohingya Muslims in Myanmar ""seems a textbook example of ethnic cleansing"", the UN human rights chief says. Zeid Raad Al Hussein urged Myanmar to end the ""cruel military operation"" in Rakhine state. More than 300,000 Rohingya Muslims have fled to Bangladesh since violence erupted there late last month. The military says it is responding to attacks by Rohingya militants and denies it is targeting civilians. The violence began on 25 August when the Rohingya militants attacked police posts in northern Rakhine, killing 12 security personnel. Rohingyas who have fled Myanmar since then say the military responded with a brutal campaign, burning villages and attacking civilians in a bid to drive them out. The Rohingya, a stateless mostly Muslim minority in Buddhist-majority Rakhine, have long experienced persecution in Myanmar, which says they are illegal immigrants. This video can not be played Who is burning down Rohingya villages? Mr Zeid, the United Nations High Commissioner for Human Rights, said the current operation in Rakhine was ""clearly disproportionate"". He noted that the situation could not be fully assessed because Myanmar had refused access to human rights investigators, but said the UN had received ""multiple reports and satellite imagery of security forces and local militia burning Rohingya villages, and consistent accounts of extrajudicial killings, including shooting fleeing civilians"". Seeing through the official story in Myanmar Who are the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army? Tales of horror from Rohingya who fled ""I call on the government to end its current cruel military operation, with accountability for all violations that have occurred and to reverse the pattern of severe and widespread discrimination against the Rohingya population,"" he said. Latest reports put the number of those who have fled to Bangladesh at 313,000. Aid agencies say they are in desperate need of food, shelter and medical aid, and that current resources are inadequate. Why won't Aung San Suu Kyi act? Myanmar conflict: The view from Yangon Fake photos inflame tensions Bangladesh is already host to hundreds of thousands of Rohingya who have fled previous outbreaks of violence in Rakhine. Existing refugee camps are full and the new arrivals are sleeping rough in whatever space they can find, reports say. This video can not be played Justin Rowlatt reports from the Bangladesh border The authorities have, however, started to register the new arrivals. Previously only those in two official camps were being documented, but government teams are now collecting fingerprints and details from all newcomers, including those in makeshift shelters. Analysts say that, until now, the government has refused to register those outside camps for fear of legitimising them. But the current move may help the government as it engages in a diplomatic battle about the Rohingyas' future, the BBC's Sanjoy Majumder reports. On Sunday, the Rohingya militant group behind the 25 August attacks declared a one-month unilateral ceasefire to allow aid agencies in, but the Myanmar government rejected it, saying it would not negotiate with ""terrorists"". It maintains that it is the militants who are burning Rohingya villages and targeting civilians, but a BBC correspondent on an official visit to Rakhine came across aMuslim village apparently burned by Rakhine Buddhists, contradicting the official narrative. Aung San Suu Kyi, Myanmar's de facto leader, is facing mounting criticism for failing to protect the Rohingya, and on Monday exiled Tibetan Buddhist leader the Dalai Lama added his voice, urging her ""to reach out to all sections of society to try to restore friendly relations"". But the Rohingya are extremely unpopular inside Myanmar. On Sunday, police fired rubber bullets to break up a mob attacking the home of a Muslim butcher in Magway region in central Myanmar. One protester was quoted by AFP news agency saying it was a response to events in Rakhine. Seeing through the official story Who is burning down Rohingya villages?

Bank bailout 'should have been secret',"The revelation of an emergency loan to Northern Rock caused a run on the bank An agreement to bail out Northern Rock which triggered a run on the bank should have been kept secret, the country's then top banker claims. TheBBC revealed,externalthe Bank of England'ssupport of the struggling North East bank,externalon 13 September 2007. The following day thousands of Northern Rock customers led the first run on a British bank since 1866. Mervyn King, then governor of the Bank of England, said he advised the deal be kept secret to prevent panic. Mervyn King - who entered the House of Lords as Baron King of Lothbury four years ago - was governor of the Bank of England from 2003 to 2013 He told BBC Inside Out, North East & Cumbria: ""My advice was very clear - we should not reveal publicly the fact we were going to lend to Northern Rock."" A Northern Rock insider told the programme the bank wanted to keep the liquidity support facility secret but was told it was ""illegal"". The then governor - now Baron King of Lothbury - disagreed. He said: ""Northern Rock and the Financial Services Authority (FSA) all felt it would be a good idea to reveal it. ""The advice of the lawyers and FSA was [keeping the deal secret] was against a European directive. ""Actually, none of my colleagues in Europe believed that for a minute."" The FSA's former head, Sir Hector Sants, said it would be ""inappropriate"" for him to comment. The following year, the Bank of England did makesecret loans worth Â£61.2bn to RBS and HBOS,external. The news of the Northern Rock loan was broken by Robert Peston, then the BBC's business editor on the News at Ten. The revelation caused many customers to try to withdraw their money and a there was a 30% drop in the value of Northern Rock shares. Many staff and customers lost thousands of pounds worth of shares in the bank in the ensuing fall and subsequent nationalisation. Northern Rock was taken over by the government in January 2008 before eventually being sold to Virgin money four years later. Northern Rock shareholders claim they should have received compensation when the government took over Mr Peston, who is now political editor of ITV News, said: ""Under the rules, the moment Northern Rock requests emergency help from the Bank of England in that way it has failed. ""That is an event. ""If I had not reported that event I would have been guilty of playing God in an incredibly patronising way. ""I'd have been effectively saying that adults were not capable of understanding the significant information and that would have been an appalling thing for any journalist to do."" Lord King said Mr Peston reported the story in a ""very responsible way"" and could not be blamed for the consequences. He also said he would have wanted a ""fair deal"" for Northern Rock shareholders, which would have seen them get the ""residual value"" of the shares when the government took over. Instead, they received nothing as the government concluded the bank was not a going concern, a viewupheld by the High Court,external. Campaigners are nowmounting a new challenge,externalfor compensation. Watch the full story on Inside Out, North East & Cumbria on Monday 11 September on BBC One at 19:30.

The Daily Express describes how Irma's last-minute change of course meant many residents, who had fled to Florida's west coast for safety, ended up experiencing the full force of the storm. A restaurant owner from Miami, who decided to sit out the hurricane in his 35th floor apartment, tells the Guardian it was like being on a ship - he could feel the building swaying the whole time. The Guardian's Ed Pilkington,reporting from the city of Naples,,externalsays the desperation of thousands of residents was palpable, particularly in the public shelters.

But forthe Telegraph,,externalthe move risks increasing the deficit and is likely to be attacked by critics on the Conservative right. But sources tellthe Times,externalthe rise won't be paid for by more borrowing, suggesting the money will be found from cuts elsewhere. Many papers get their first chance to comment on Tony Blair'scall for a new immigration policy, which he suggests could address public concerns about immigration, without Britain having to leave the EU.

The Daily Express accuses the former prime minister of ""sheer gall"", whilethe Sun,externalsays the idea that senior EU officials could shift on the question of free movement is ""delusional"". The Guardian columnist Matthew d'Ancona,externalaccuses Mr Blair of yielding too much ground on the question of immigration.

The Guardian,externalleads with a claim by the UN's rapporteur on toxic waste that the government is ""flouting"" its duty to protect its citizens from illegal and dangerous levels of air pollution. The paper says such harsh international criticism will embarrass ministers, whose proposals to tackle air pollution have already been ruled illegal and inadequate on two occasions.

News Daily: Irma hits Florida and police pay rise,"Hello. Here's your morning briefing: After making its way through the Caribbean, causing death and destruction, Hurricane Irma has hit Florida.It's brought winds of up to 120mph (192km/h), leaving 3.4 million homes in the US state without power, while parts of the city of Miami are under water. Irma has been downgraded from a category three to a category two storm, but that will provide little comfort to the three million people living in the Tampa Bay area, which it is approaching. Some 6.3 million people in Florida were told to evacuate ahead of Irma's arrival and US President Donald Trump has approved a major disaster declaration and emergency federal aid for the state. You can follow the latest developments as Irma continues its journey through the US using our live page. Since 2013 pay rises for most public sector workers have been capped at 1% per year. But the BBC understands thatthe restriction is to be lifted for the first time for police and prison officers. Political correspondent Iain Watson said it was the ""first concrete example of the pay cap being dismantled"". Other public sector workers may get the same news soon, it's understood. Unions, Labour and some Conservative MPs have been calling for the cap to go. Get news from the BBC in your inbox, each weekday morning,external MPs will vote later on the government bill which aims to end EU law's supremacy in the UK.Labour is opposing the EU (Withdrawal) Bill, claiming that it allows ministers too much power to act without consulting Parliament. But Brexit Secretary David Davis is warning that not backing the legislation would lead to a ""chaotic"" Brexit. The bill would also convert all existing EU laws into domestic ones, to ensure there are no gaps in legislation after the UK leaves. By Tim Harford, BBC World Service The Book of the Marvels of the World was full of strange foreign customs that Marco Polo claimed to have seen.

Russian military exercise raises tension,"This video can not be played Russian military helicopters on exercise in Crimea, Feb 2016 It is being billed as a military exercise, but when Russian and Belarusian forces start Zapad-2017 this week, many neighbouring countries will be looking on nervously. Zapad-2017 (""West-2017"") is a joint strategic-level exercise involving Russian and Belarusian military forces, expected to begin on 14 September in Russia's western military district Kaliningrad, and across Belarus. It is scheduled to last about a week, but may well go on for longer. The exercise is part of a four-year rolling cycle of manoeuvres that focus each year on one broad region or ""front"" (""West"", ""Eastern"", ""Central"" or ""Caucasus""). This year's Zapad exercise though is drawing much greater attention than did its predecessor in 2013. The context has changed significantly. Russia has seized and annexed Crimea; it has supported a separatist war in eastern Ukraine with weaponry, training and, for periods, its own combat units. Russia is thus seen by several Nato countries as much more threatening. Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko hasdescribed Russia's build-upfor the exercise as ""preparations for an offensive war on a continental scale"". Ukrainian border defences, he said, are being bolstered. He also pointed to the fact that in his view, Russia has form here, using the pretext of an exercise to mobilise and position forces to conduct offensive operations. President Poroshenko said he could not rule out the possibility that the drill ""may be used as a smokescreen to create new Russian army assault groups to invade Ukrainian territory"". Pantsir anti-aircraft missile: Russian and foreign troops competed in army games last month Nato watchers and insiders do not necessarily share this concern about an all-out invasion of Ukraine. Russia expert Keir Giles, a fellow at Chatham House think tank, acknowledges that ""previous Russian exercises on this scale have prepositioned troops for undertaking military operations, against Georgia in 2008 and against Ukraine in 2014"". However, he says, ""both of those moves were precipitated by an immediate political crisis - currently absent in Europe. ""And there have been plenty of other major Russian exercises in between,"" he says, ""which did not end up with somebody getting invaded"". US backs Baltics against Russia 'threat' Nato fears fast-moving Russian troops Eastern Ukraine: A new, bloody chapter Russia's information warfare in Europe Nonetheless, the fear of a resurgent and more aggressive Russia is real enough. That is why, over the past year, Nato has sent small multi-national units to Poland and to each of the three Baltic republics to underline its deterrent message. And that is why this year's war games will be watched so closely. Just how closely is a contentious issue. Russia, unlike Belarus, has been far more reluctant to invite Western observers in any number. This despite the fact that, as a member of the OSCE international security body, it is obliged to send out broad invitations if an exercise numbers more than 13,000 troops. Mr Giles notes that, while Russia may be ""content to see Europe alarmed at the prospect of Moscow throwing its military weight around"", Belarus seeks instead to calm the situation. The siting of the exercise in ranges across the middle of the country - not near the Polish and Lithuanian borders - was a deliberate policy decision intended to reduce the chances of misinterpretation, or incidents when Russian troops and aircraft come close to Nato borders. This Polish F-16 is part of a Nato air-policing mission over the Baltic states (Aug 2017 photo) Belarus has been much more open towards international observers. Clearly satellites, airborne radars and other national intelligence collection measures will be used by Nato countries. In addition, efforts are under way to mobilise concerned citizens in Belarus to observe military movements in their area and post them online for the benefit of non-government, open-source analysts and experts. So just how big is this exercise and what will Western analysts and observers be watching for? Here assessments differ widely. The Russians say some 12,700 troops will be involved in total, including a significant contingent from Belarus. (Notice this takes it below the 13,000 OSCE threshold.) Western experts watching the preparations, especially the marshalling of railway flat-cars - the main way of moving heavy armoured formations to the exercise areas - say it will be considerably more. Russia has stepped up snap military manoeuvres (March 2015 photo) Some estimates suggest that up to 80,000 troops could be involved, but since there are a range of drills, exercises and spot mobilisations it is hard to be precise about numbers. Russia will be testing its capacity to contain and respond to some form of outside aggression and will be deploying units from different services: heavy armour; airborne troops; ""spetsnaz"" elite reconnaissance teams; and electronic warfare specialists. The Baltic Fleet will be involved, as will units from the 14th Corps based in Kaliningrad. One point of interest may be the part played at the tactical and strategic levels of ""information operations troops"" - a relatively new formation in the Russian order of battle. Indeed, while there may be much to learn about Russia's use of artillery, its capability in electronic warfare (already manifest in the fighting in Ukraine) and the growing importance of precision-guided munitions in Russia's thinking, it may be this information aspect that is most important. For beyond the troop movements, Zapad-2017 is part of a wider propaganda effort to influence and shape opinion in the West. The US analyst Michael Kofman ina fascinating piece,externalon the War on the Rocks website, describes Zapad as ""a good window into the Russian mindset. ""For all the modernisation and transformation of the Russian armed forces,"" he writes, ""in reality the Russian leadership is probably still afraid: afraid the United States will try to make a bid for Belarus, afraid of American technological and economic superiority, afraid the US seeks regime change in Moscow, and afraid Washington desires the complete fragmentation of Russian influence in its near abroad, or even worse, Russia itself."" ""Zapad,"" he argues, ""is the most coherent manifestation of these fears, and a threat from Moscow to the United States about what it might do if the worst should come to pass."" And what of those lingering fears in some quarters that this could be much more than just an exercise? Mr Giles remains unconvinced by much of the media hyperbole surrounding Zapad. But he has this caution: ""The time to watch troop deployments most closely,"" he says, ""is likely to be after the exercise proper has ended."" The final day of Zapad is 20 September but, he notes, ""Russian troops are only scheduled to leave Belarus by 30 September - after the observers have departed, and when the media interest will have died down. That will be the time to decide whether Zapad this year has in fact passed off peacefully.""

NHS 'failing to screen and treat sepsis',"Sepsis is a potentially fatal condition caused by the body overreacting to infection One in four NHS hospital trusts is failing to give antibiotics to half their patients with sepsis within the recommended time, new figures suggest. Figures from 104 trusts seen by BBC Panorama show 78% of eligible patients are being screened and 63% are getting antibiotics within one hour. Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said the NHS had ""more to do"" to stop ""preventable"" sepsis deaths occurring. Sepsis is a rare but serious complication of an infection. Without prompt treatment, it can lead to multiple organ failure and death. In 2015, concerned at the growing number of sepsis cases going undetected, the NHS told hospital trusts to examine how successful they were at identifying patients with the condition. The figures seen by Panorama cover the 12 months to March 2017. Alistair Jackson, a reporter for Panorama, decided to investigate sepsis after his mother, Margaret, died two years ago. Margaret had been treated by her GP for a urinary tract infection. She was admitted to Queen's Hospital in Burton upon Trent, Staffordshire, shortly afterwards with chest pains and a high temperature. Alistair's father, John, remembers how quickly his wife deteriorated. Margaret Jackson died from sepsis in 2015 - there was a delay in treating with antibiotics ""She woke up in the morning and said 'I've never felt as ill as this before'. ""She quite clearly said to me at one point 'oh God is this the end?' and I said 'no don't be silly, of course not' and I think those were virtually the last words she ever uttered."" Sepsis was not recorded as having contributed to Margaret's death. Dr Ron Daniels is one of the world's leading sepsis experts and chief executive of the Sepsis Trust. He reviewed Margaret's treatment for Panorama. ""There's no evidence from the notes that sepsis itself was considered even in the face of abnormal observations and even when she started to deteriorate very quickly,"" he said. Margaret was eventually prescribed antibiotics but there was a three-hour delay in administering them. ""She received them eventually but I think it's quite clear that she received them too late. There was opportunity to administer antibiotics several hours before they were ultimately administered,"" said Dr Daniels. ""I think it's unlikely that earlier antibiotics would have done any harm and it's entirely possible that they might have improved her chances of survival."" Burton hospital says it has made vast improvements in the past six months and is now screening 98% of in-patients. Speaking to Panorama about the new figures, Health Secretary Jeremy Hunt said: ""There are preventable deaths happening but we're bringing them down and I think that the picture is much improved from two years ago. but there's a long way to go. ""Safety is at the top of the NHS's in-trayâ¦ and sepsis is, if you like, a litmus test as to whether we're getting there. ""And I would say that what it shows is that we are making progress but there is a lot more work to do.""

How Chinese mulberry bark paved the way for paper money,"Almost 750 years ago, a young Venetian merchant named Marco Polo wrote a remarkable book chronicling his travels in China. The Book of the Marvels of the World was full of strange foreign customs that Marco claimed to have seen. But there was one that was so extraordinary, Marco Polo could barely contain himself: ""Tell it how I might,"" he wrote, ""you never would be satisfied that I was keeping within truth and reason."" What had excited Marco so much? He was one of the first Europeans to witness an invention that remains at the foundation of the modern economy: paper money. 50 Things That Made the Modern Economyhighlights the inventions, ideas and innovations which have helped create the economic world in which we live. It is broadcast on the BBC World Service. You can findmore information about the programme's sourcesandlisten onlineorsubscribe to the programme podcast. Of course, the paper itself isn't the point. Modern paper money isn't made of paper - it's made of cotton fibres or plastic. And the Chinese money that so fascinated Marco Polo wasn't quite paper either. It was made from a black sheet derived from the bark of mulberry trees, signed by multiple officials and, with a seal smothered in bright red vermilion, authenticated by the Chinese emperor Kublai Khan himself. Kublai Khan announced that officially stamped mulberry bark was money - and lo, it was The chapter of Marco Polo's book was titled, somewhat breathlessly: ""How the great Khan Causes the Bark of Trees, Made into Something Like Paper, to Pass for Money All over His Country"". The point is, that whatever these notes were made of, their value didn't come from the preciousness of the substance, as with a gold or silver coin. Instead, the value was created purely by the authority of the government. Paper money is sometimes called fiat money - the Latin word ""fiat"" means ""let it be done"". The Great Khan announces that officially stamped mulberry bark is money - and lo, let it be done. Money it is. The genius of this system amazed Marco Polo, who explained that the paper money circulated as though it were gold or silver itself. Where was all the gold that wasn't circulating? Well, the emperor kept a tight hold of that. The Mulberry money itself wasn't new when Marco Polo heard about it. It had emerged nearly three centuries earlier, around the year 1000 in Sichuan, China. Sichuan was a frontier province, bordered by foreign and sometimes hostile states. China's rulers didn't want valuable gold and silver currency to leak into foreign lands, and so they imposed a bizarre rule. Sichuan had to use coins made of iron. These Chinese coins dating back to the Song Dynasty (960-1279) were found in 2005 Iron coins aren't terribly practical. If you traded in a handful of silver coins - 50g worth - you'd be given your own body weight in iron coins. Even something simple like salt was worth more, gram for gram, than iron - so if you went to the market for groceries, your sackful of coins on the way there would weigh more than the bag of goods that you brought back. Sichuan merchants had a problem, as William Goetzmann explains in his book Money Changes Everything. It was illegal to use gold and silver coins, and impractical to use iron coins. It's no surprise that they began to experiment with an alternative. That alternative was called ""jiaozi"", or ""exchange bills"". Instead of carrying around a wagonload of iron coins, a well-known and trusted merchant would write an IOU, and promise to pay his bill later when it was more convenient for everyone. That was a simple enough idea. But then there was a twist, a kind of economic magic. These ""jiaozi"", or IOUs, started to trade freely. The warrior monks who invented banking What makes gambling wrong but insurance right? How the invention of paper changed the world What tally sticks tell us about how money works Suppose I supply some goods to the eminently reputable Mr Zhang, and he gives me an IOU. When I go to your shop later, rather than paying you with iron coins - who does that? - I could write you an IOU. But it might be simpler - and indeed you might prefer it - if instead I give you Mr Zhang's IOU. After all, we both know he's good for the money. Now you, and I, and Mr Zhang, have together created a kind of primitive paper money - it's a promise to repay that has a marketable value of its own - and can be passed around from person to person without being redeemed. This is very good news for Mr Zhang, because as long as people keep finding it convenient simply to pass on his IOU as a way of paying for things, Mr Zhang never actually has to stump up the iron coins. Effectively, he enjoys an interest-free loan for as long as his IOU continues to circulate. Better still, it's a loan that he may never be asked to repay. A fragment of one of the earliest surviving banknotes, which was printed in the early 1260s No wonder the Chinese authorities started to think these benefits ought to accrue to them, rather than to the likes of Mr Zhang. At first they regulated the issuance of jiaozi, but then outlawed private jiaozi and took over the whole business themselves. The official jiaozi currency was a huge hit, circulating across regions and even internationally. In fact, the jiaozi even traded at a premium, because they were so much easier to carry around than metal coins. Initially, the government-issued jiaozi could be redeemed for coins on demand, exactly as the private jiaozi had been. This was logical: it treated the paper notes as a placeholder for something of real value. But the government soon moved stealthily to a fiat system, maintaining the principle but abandoning the practice of redeeming jiaozi for metal. Bring an old jiaozi in to the government treasury to be redeemed, and you would receive a crisp new jiaozi. That was a very modern step. The money we use today all over the world is created by central banks and it's backed by nothing in particular except the promises to replace old notes with fresh ones. The oldest known British bank note, issued by the Bank of England in 1699 We've moved from a situation where Mr Zhang's IOU circulates without ever being redeemed, to the mind-bending situation where the government's IOUs circulate despite never being redeemed. For governments, fiat money represents a temptation: a government with bills to pay can simply print more money. And when more money chases the same amount of goods and services, prices tend to go up. The temptation quickly proved too great to resist. The Song dynasty issued too many jiaozi. Counterfeiting was also a problem. Within a few decades of its invention in the early 11th century, jiaozi was devalued and discredited, trading at just 10% of its face value. Other countries have since suffered much worse. Weimar Germany and Zimbabwe are famous examples of economies collapsing into chaos as excessive money-printing rendered prices meaningless. Zimbabwe has seen extraordinarily high inflation The abysmal world record for hyperinflation is held by Hungary in 1946, where prices trebled during the course of every day. Walk into a Budapest cafe back then, and it was better to pay for your coffee when you arrived, not when you left. These rare but terrifying episodes have convinced some economic radicals that fiat money can never be stable. They yearn for a return to the days of the gold standard, when paper money could always be redeemed for a little piece of the precious metal held inside Fort Knox. Gold has been used as currency for thousands of years But mainstream economists generally now believe that pegging the money supply to gold is a terrible idea. Most regard low and predictable inflation as no problem at all - perhaps even a useful lubricant to economic activity. And while we may not always be able to trust central bankers to print just the right amount of new money, it probably makes more sense than trusting miners to dig up just the right amount of new gold. The ability to fire up the printing presses is especially useful in crisis situations. After the 2007 financial crisis, the US Federal Reserve pumped trillions of dollars into the economy, without creating inflation. In fact, the printing presses were metaphorical: those trillions were simply created by key-strokes on computers in the global banking system. As a wide-eyed Marco Polo might have put it: ""The great Central Bank Causes the Digits on a Computer Screen, Made into Something Like Spreadsheets, to Pass for Money"". Technology has changed, but what passes for money continues to astonish.
